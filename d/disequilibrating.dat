40|$|Abstract. Kirzner’s (1973) {{theory of}} {{entrepreneurship}} emphasizes the equilibrating role of entrepreneurship. When {{the market is}} not in equilibrium, profit opportunities exist, and entrepreneurs discover and act on these profit opportunities to equilibrate the market. Because Kirzner focuses on entrepreneurial actions when profit opportunities exist, and does not describe where they come from, one could imagine a fixed stock of profit opportunities that get used up as entrepreneurs discover them. But new profit opportunities are being created constantly. A taxonomy {{of the origins of}} entrepreneurial opportunities includes factors that <b>disequilibrate</b> the market, factors that enhance production possibilities, and most notably, opportunities created from previous acts of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurial actions do not use up profit opportunities, but create them, and the critical role of entrepreneurship in the creation of new profit opportunities is emphasized. This line of reasoning leads directly to policy implications regarding the economic environment conducive to entrepreneurial discovery and the role of government in research and development. This paper enhances Kirzner’s theory of entrepreneurship by illustrating how entrepreneurship enlarges the stock of future entrepreneurial opportunities, and points to entrepreneurship as the engine of economic progress.

40|$|Background: Unbalanced {{nutrient}} availability causes <b>disequilibrated</b> plant growth, which {{can result in}} a worsening of harvested product quality, such as high nitrate content in edible tissues. To cope with this problem, improved knowledge of the mechanisms involved in nutrient acquisition and regulation is necessary. For this purpose the responses of acquisition mechanisms of N, Fe and S were studied as a function of Fe and S availability using two corn salad cultivars grown hydroponically, considering also aspects related to N metabolism. Results: The results showed that an increase in Fe or S availability enhanced nitrate uptake and assimilation, which in turn increased biomass production of leaves with lower nitrate content. In particular, high S availability exerted a positive effect (gene expression and functionality) both on the uptake and metabolism of N and on Fe acquisition mechanisms. Conclusion: The data presented here show close interactions between N, S and Fe, highlighting that relevant improvements in yield and quality from soilless culture might also be obtained through appropriate adjustments of {{nutrient availability}}. In this respect, concerning the role of S in the acquisition mechanisms of N and Fe and in N metabolism, its level of availability should be taken into high consideration for equilibrated plant growth...|$|R
40|$|Cells {{generally}} convert nutrient {{resources to}} useful products via energy transduction. Accordingly, the thermodynamic efficiency of this conversion process {{is one of}} the most essential characteristics of living organisms. However, although these processes occur under conditions of dynamic metabolism, most studies of cellular thermodynamic efficiency have been restricted to examining steady states; thus, the relevance of dynamics to this efficiency has not yet been elucidated. Here, we develop a simple model of metabolic reactions with anabolism-catabolism coupling catalysed by enzymes. Through application of external oscillation in the enzyme abundances, the thermodynamic efficiency of metabolism was found to be improved. This result is in strong contrast with that observed in the oscillatory input, in which the efficiency always decreased with oscillation. This improvement was effectively achieved by separating the anabolic and catabolic reactions, which tend to <b>disequilibrate</b> each other, and taking advantage of the temporal oscillations so that each of the antagonistic reactions could progress near equilibrium. In this case, anti-phase oscillation between the reaction flux and chemical affinity through oscillation of enzyme abundances is essential. This improvement was also confirmed in a model capable of generating autonomous oscillations in enzyme abundances. Finally, the possible relevance of the improvement in thermodynamic efficiency is discussed with respect to the potential for manipulation of metabolic oscillations in microorganisms...|$|R

The Cw16 allele is undoubtedly derived from Western Africa the diversity and frequency of Cw16 declines away from the along the Greenwich longitudinal line. The level of linkage disequilibration about Cw16 postulates a recent arrival from Africa, and indicates a substantial contribution {{as far north as}} Ireland. The A33-Cw7-B44-DR7 offers the same scenario. This haplotype is found in Korea but not Japan, in fact Japan is an antinode of DR7. The most frequent A-B-DR-DQ haplotypes in Korea are found at ~3/4 the Korean frequencies in Japan, except A33-Cw7-B44-DR7-DQ2, which indicates that DR7 likely spread into Korea after the Japan's Yayoi migration when most of the Korean contribution occurred. Similarities with Mongol genes suggest that Central and East- Central Asian are the likely source, confirmed by the fact the haplotype is found in Pakistan, China and India. There is the possibility that this haplotype is a recent (Holocene) arrival from Africa or the Middle East to Central Asia as this best explains the alleles within the haplotype.

Building on prior work in competitive dynamics from the Austrian School perspective, we propose that imitation {{can be an}} effective means of staying ahead, even in the ab-sence of mimetic social pressures. This is because the leader’s {{imitation of}} follower actions represents equilibrating moves {{to maintain the status quo}} in reaction to the <b>disequilibrating</b> actions that the follower undertakes to catch up with the leader. Fur-thermore, reduction of difference in competitive positioning between leader and fol-lower serves the same purpose, and both imitation strategies are complementary. These effects of “action imitation ” and “positioning imitation,”we argue, are moderated by the degree of environmental uncertainty, by the extent of the leader’s initial advantage, and by the difference between leader and follower capabilities. Our theoretical arguments are supported by an analysis of data on head-to-head boat races from the America’s Cup World Series. By developing mechanisms that take endogenous and exogenous con-tingencies of competitive interactions into account, this paper advances competitive dynamics as a predictive theory of performance outcomes.

Relict chondrules in Galim (b) served as nucleation sites for euhedral enstatite grains crystallizing from the impact melt. Many of the reduced phases typical of EH chondrites (e. g., Si-bearing metallic Fe-Ni; Ti-bearing troilite) are absent. Galim (b) was probably shock-melted while in contact with a more oxidized source, namely, Galim (a); during this event, Si was oxidized from the metal and Ti was oxidized from troilite. Galim (a) contains shock veins and recrystallized, unzoned olivine.

Shock-induced redox reactions such as those inferred for the Galim breccia appear to be restricted mainly to asteroids because the low-end tail of their relative-velocity distribution permits mixing of intact disparate materials (including accretion of projectiles of different oxidation states), whereas the peak of the distribution leads to high equilibration shock pressures (allowing impact-induced exchange between previously accreted, <b>disequilibrated</b> materials).

If this is true, the hydrogen isotope ratio of methane in geological samples would be useless as a tracer to deduce the origin of methane. However, it is also possible to criticize this hypothesis: the diagenetic isotope exchange proposed here is not required when methanogenesis through geological time actually exhibits isotope fractionation in the third province, as aforementioned. Furthermore, an in vitro biochemical study of methyl coenzyme M reductase activity, which is an enzyme that catalyzes the last step of methanogenesis, showed that little hydrogen isotope exchange between CH 4 and H 2 O occurred during the enzyme reaction for several tens of minutes (Scheller et al. 2013). It is still uncertain whether diagenetic hydrogen isotope exchange can be promoted by methanogens or not and how rapid the isotope exchange is if it occurs. To solve these uncertainties, experiments using methanogenic cells concentrated in mediums with isotopically <b>disequilibrated</b> CH 4 and H 2 O under thermodynamic states favorable to each of methane generation and methane consumption will be conducted.
