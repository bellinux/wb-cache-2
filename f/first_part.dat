40|$|AbstractThe functor {{from regular}} biframes to frames, taking <b>first</b> <b>parts,</b> {{is shown to}} be faithful.

Then the congruence frame, regarded as a biframe, is characterized as being the unique regular biframe extension. This provides a pointfree analogue to a result of Salbany (1970, 1974 [16]) that the forgetful functor from completely regular bitopological spaces to all topological spaces, taking <b>first</b> <b>parts,</b> has a unique section...|$|R
50|$|The {{sequence}} of chapters in both books of The Shield of Achilles follows the {{sequence of}} the novel Nostromo by Joseph Conrad—present, past, future. Somewhat more prosaically, this is the order of Statement of Facts, Statement of Law, and Holding in an Anglo-American judicial opinion. The <b>first</b> <b>parts</b> of Book I and Book II deal with 20th-century and contemporary events; the second parts of both books then flash back {{to the emergence of}} states in the 16th century and take the historical narrative up {{to the point where the}} <b>first</b> <b>parts</b> had begun; the third part of each book addresses the future, beginning where the <b>first</b> <b>parts</b> left off. This methodical if unorthodox sequencing allows the historian to avoid the tempting mechanics of foreshadowing, emphasizing the possibilities of different outcomes at each stage, and deepening the understanding of how the past can liberate the present.|$|R
