5|$|At this {{juncture}} Richard saw Henry at some distance behind his main force. Seeing this, Richard decided {{to end the}} fight quickly by killing the enemy commander. He led a charge of mounted men around the melee and tore into Henry's group; several accounts state that Richard's force numbered 800–1000knights, but Ross says it was more likely that Richard was accompanied only by his household men and closest friends. Richard killed Henry's standard-bearer Sir William Brandon in the <b>initial</b> <b>charge</b> and unhorsed burly John Cheyne, Edward IV's former standard-bearer, with {{a blow to the}} head from his broken lance. French mercenaries in Henry's retinue related how the attack had caught them off guard and that Henry sought protection by dismounting and concealing himself among them to present less of a target. Henry made no attempt to engage in combat himself.|$|E
5|$|On 21 March 1995, Martin {{was taken}} to court on an <b>initial</b> <b>charge,</b> naming him as Simon James Davis and accusing him of forging Lowe's {{signature}} on a DBS Bank credit card transaction slip to obtain S$6,000 in cash on 9 March. Three days later, he was charged under his real name {{for the murder of}} Gerard Lowe in a River View Hotel room some time between 8 March and 9. In subsequent hearings, he was additionally charged with forgery (forging Lowe's signature five more times to obtain cash and goods worth $3,200), vandalism (smashing the glass panel), possession of an offensive weapon (the electroshock weapon), and possession of a controlled drug (he had 24 sticks of cannabis {{at the time of his}} arrest).|$|E
5|$|After {{the militia}} {{advanced}} about 200yards (200m), the Kickapoo suddenly let loose a loud yell from their hidden {{position on the}} bank of an oxbow lake along the river. The warriors fired a volley toward the advancing militia and three men, Samuel Black, Samuel Wells and Montaville Morris, were hit and went down. Dodge did not hesitate and ordered his men to charge, they obeyed and waited until they were within six feet of the Kickapoo before discharging their weapons. The fight, after the <b>initial</b> <b>charge</b> and volley, descended into a hand-to-hand struggle with tomahawks, bayonets, muskets and spears the weapons of choice. The fighting only lasted a few minutes: nine Kickapoo were killed on the spot and the other two were felled while fleeing across the lake. During the hand-to-hand combat a fourth member of the militia, Thomas Jenkins, was wounded. Though short, the Battle of Horseshoe Bend had a lasting impact and influence {{on the rest of the}} war.|$|E

50|$|The two EcoBots do not employ {{any other}} form of {{conventional}} power supply and do not require any form of <b>initial</b> <b>charging</b> from an external source. Instead, they are powered directly by the onboard microbial fuel cells (MFCs). This is in contrast with Gastrobot, which although it was the first example of a practical application that employed MFCs, it used onboard conventional batteries and required <b>initial</b> <b>charging</b> from the mains.|$|R
40|$|This letter {{reports a}} method for the <b>initial</b> <b>charging</b> of {{capacitors}} in grid-connected flying capacitor (FC) multilevel converters. A resistor is inserted between each phase of the FC converter and the grid. A voltage balancing algorithm is activated {{from the beginning of}} the process and the FC converter generates proper output voltages to achieve balanced charging of both the dc-bus capacitor and the FCs. The proposed <b>initial</b> <b>charging</b> method achieves low voltage and current stress on the power devices and the passive components. The method is simple to implement and can be applied to an FC with any number of levels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Postprint (published version...|$|R
5|$|The {{fighting}} soon devolved into man-on-man combat; Seydlitz himself fought like a trooper, {{receiving a}} severe wound. He ordered his last 18 squadrons, still {{waiting at the}} Janus, into the fray. The second charge struck the French cavalry at an oblique angle. The mêlée drifted rapidly southward, past the Allied infantry. Part of the Allied reserve, which had become entangled between the main columns, was extricating itself by degrees and endeavoring {{to catch up with}} the rest of the reserve column away to the right, but the sweep of horses and Allied infantry pulled them into the fighting. The Allied reserve artillery proved useless; caught in the middle of the infantry columns, it could not deploy to support any of the endangered Allied troops. The Prussian infantry on the Shartau hill waited in echelon from the left. Those Allied units who escaped the artillery and the horsemen ran headlong into a hail of musket fire from Prince Henry's infantry. Attempted French counterattacks dissolved into confusion. Most of the Allied cavalry units in front were smashed by the <b>initial</b> <b>charge</b> and many of them trampled over their own men trying to flee. The field was littered with riderless horses and horseless men, wounded, dying and dead. This part of the action took about 30 minutes.|$|E

25|$|Kisenosato {{is mainly}} a yotsu-sumo wrestler, and his {{favourite}} {{grip on his}} opponent's mawashi is hidari-yotsu, or right hand outside, left hand inside. His most common winning kimarite is yorikiri (force out), followed by oshidashi (push out) and tsukiotoshi (thrust over).

25|$|Frictional {{machines}} were, in time, gradually {{superseded by}} the second class of instrument mentioned above, namely, influence machines. These operate by electrostatic induction and convert mechanical work into electrostatic energy by {{the aid of a}} small <b>initial</b> <b>charge</b> which is continually being replenished and reinforced. The first suggestion of an influence machine appears to have grown out of the invention of Volta's electrophorus. The electrophorus is a single-plate capacitor used to produce imbalances of electric charge via the process of electrostatic induction.|$|E

25|$|In general, cloud-to-ground (CG) {{lightning}} flashes {{account for}} only 25% of all total lightning flashes worldwide. Since {{the base of a}} thunderstorm is usually negatively charged, this is where most CG lightning originates. This region is typically at the elevation where freezing occurs within the cloud. Freezing, combined with collisions between ice and water, appears to be a critical part of the <b>initial</b> <b>charge</b> development and separation process. During wind-driven collisions, ice crystals tend to develop a positive charge, while a heavier, slushy mixture of ice and water (called graupel) develops a negative charge. Updrafts within a storm cloud separate the lighter ice crystals from the heavier graupel, causing the top region of the cloud to accumulate a positive space charge while the lower level accumulates a negative space charge.|$|E

After falling back, the Lakota and Cheyenne kept firing from a distance and attacked several times in small parties. When counterattacked by the soldiers, the warriors sped away on their swift horses. Crook realized his charges were ineffective.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} full {{nonlinear}} {{calculation of the}} formation of Q-ball through the Affleck-Dine (AD) mechanism by numerical simulations. It is shown that large Q-balls are actually produced by the fragmentation of the condensate of a scalar field whose potential is very flat. We find that the typical size of Q-balls is determined by that of the most developed mode of linearized fluctuations when the amplitude of fluctuations grow as large as that of the homogeneous mode: ∼ϕ^ 2. Almost all the <b>initial</b> <b>charges</b> which the AD condensate carries are absorbed into the formed Q-balls, leaving only a small fraction in the form of coherently oscillating AD condensate. Moreover, the actual sizes and the charges stored within Q-balls depend on the <b>initial</b> <b>charges.</b> We also find that the evolution of the Q-ball crucially depends on its spatial dimensions, and the stable Q-ball can exist only in the form of three dimensional object...|$|R
40|$|First {{steps of}} the {{development}} of a catalysed reactive distillation process for the pro-duction of n-propyl acetate based on experiments and simulations are proposed. The reaction kinetics catalysed heterogeneously by Amberlyst- 15 was investigated and the constants for a pseudo-homogeneous model are presented. Pilot plant experiments were performed using a strong acid catalyst homogeneous acid in a packed column. A top-column decanter is used to withdraw the aqueous phase and to reflux the organic phase. Simulation results are in good agreement with experiment data. Thermo-dynamics nonidealities are taken into account using VLE and LLE NRTL interaction parameters. Alcohol conversion and n-propyl acetate purity higher than 97 % can be expected just by adding a stripping section to the pilot plant column. The startup is studied {{in order to determine the}} best strategy to achieve steady-state conditions. The strong influence of the composition of the <b>initial</b> <b>charging</b> can be seen and an <b>initial</b> <b>charging</b> of the two-phase top product leads to the fastest startup...|$|R
25|$|At 5 p.m., the Confederate forces {{launched}} their attack, charging the entire Union line. Walker's and Mouton's {{attack on the}} Union right had little success — the Union right, for the most part, held its ground. However, overall, this <b>initial</b> <b>charge</b> by the Confederates was highly successful {{and many of the}} positions down the Union left and center were overrun by Churchill's and Parson's forces and the Union positions were forced backwards. However, the Union side succeeded in halting the advance and regained the left and center ground, before driving the Confederates from the field. The fiercely fought battle lasted about two hours. Losses were heavy on both sides. The 32nd Iowa Infantry sustained especially heavy casualties, as it was cut {{off from the rest of}} the Union forces during the battle.|$|E
25|$|The Jacobites {{received}} several French shipments {{during the winter}} but the Royal Navy's blockade caused increasing shortages of both money and food. This meant that when Cumberland left Aberdeen on 8 April, Charles and his senior officers agreed a decisive battle was their best option. The choice of location has been argued ever since but is unlikely to have changed the result. As well as superior numbers and equipment, Cumberland's troops were intensively drilled in countering the key Highlanders offensive tactic of using the speed and ferocity of their <b>initial</b> <b>charge</b> to break the enemy line. When successful, this resulted in rapid victories as at Prestonpans and Falkirk but if it failed, they could not hold their ground. With the Jacobite forces exhausted by an ill-advised night march, the Battle of Culloden on 16 April was over {{in less than an}} hour and ended in a decisive government victory.|$|E
25|$|Hokutoumi was {{primarily}} a oshi-sumo specialist, preferring pushing and thrusting techniques that got his opponents {{out of the ring}} as quickly as possible. He had a powerful tachi-ai, or <b>initial</b> <b>charge,</b> and his speciality was nodowa, a single-handed push to the throat. To do this he would lock up his opponent's right arm with his left (a technique known as ottsuke) and thrust with his right. His most common winning kimarite by far were oshi-dashi and yori-kiri, which together accounted for around 60 percent of his wins at sekitori level. When fighting on the mawashi he preferred a migi-yotsu (left hand outside, right hand inside) grip.

25|$|When {{the main}} {{electron}} gun writes an image to the screen, the {{energy in the}} main beam is sufficient to create a 'potential relief' on the storage mesh. The areas where this relief is created no longer repel the electrons from the flood gun which now pass through the mesh and illuminate the phosphor screen. Consequently, the image that was briefly traced out by the main gun continues to be displayed after it has occurred. The image can be 'erased' by resupplying the external voltage to the mesh restoring its constant potential. The time for which the image can be displayed was limited because, in practice, the flood gun slowly neutralises the charge on the storage mesh. One way of allowing the image to be retained for longer is temporarily {{to turn off the}} flood gun. It is then possible for the image to be retained for several days. The majority of storage tubes allow for a lower voltage to be applied to the storage mesh which slowly restores the <b>initial</b> <b>charge</b> state. By varying this voltage a variable persistence is obtained. Turning off the flood gun and the voltage supply to the storage mesh allows such a tube to operate as a conventional oscilloscope tube.|$|E
25|$|Where {{a single}} brief event is {{monitored}} by an oscilloscope, {{such an event}} will be displayed by a conventional tube only while it actually occurs. The use of a long persistence phosphor may allow the image to be observed after the event, {{but only for a}} few seconds at best. This limitation can be overcome by the use of a direct view storage cathode ray tube (storage tube). A storage tube will continue to display the event after it has occurred until such time as it is erased. A storage tube is similar to a conventional tube except that it is equipped with a metal grid coated with a dielectric layer located immediately behind the phosphor screen. An externally applied voltage to the mesh initially ensures that the whole mesh is at a constant potential. This mesh is constantly exposed to a low velocity electron beam from a 'flood gun' which operates independently of the main gun. This flood gun is not deflected like the main gun but constantly 'illuminates' the whole of the storage mesh. The <b>initial</b> <b>charge</b> on the storage mesh is such as to repel the electrons from the flood gun which are prevented from striking the phosphor screen.|$|E
25|$|Lightning is a {{dramatic}} natural example of static discharge. While the details are unclear and remain a subject of debate, the <b>initial</b> <b>charge</b> separation {{is thought to be}} associated with contact between ice particles within storm clouds. In general, significant charge accumulations can only persist in regions of low electrical conductivity (very few charges free to move in the surroundings), hence the flow of neutralizing charges often results from neutral atoms and molecules in the air being torn apart to form separate positive and negative charges, which travel in opposite directions as an electric current, neutralizing the original accumulation of charge. The static charge in air typically breaks down in this way at around 10,000 volts per centimeter (10 kV/cm) depending on humidity. The discharge superheats the surrounding air causing the bright flash, and produces a shock wave causing the clicking sound. The lightning bolt is simply a scaled-up version of the sparks seen in more domestic occurrences of static discharge. The flash occurs because the air in the discharge channel is heated to such a high temperature that it emits light by incandescence. The clap of thunder {{is the result of the}} shock wave created as the superheated air expands explosively.|$|E
