25|$|A rock {{arch and}} several notable bluffs are formed of late Whaingaroan Ahirau Sandstone formed about 28 million years ago. Although {{classified}} as sandstone, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> limestone, with 40-60% calcium carbonate content and lapiez features in massive (lacking internal structures), blue-grey, calcareous, fine sandstone.|$|E
25|$|The rostrum (snout) {{is unlike}} that of undisputed crown mammals; in fact <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> that of a pelycosaur, such as Dimetrodon. The multituberculate rostrum is box-like, with the large flat maxillae forming the sides, the nasal the top, and the tall premaxilla at the front.|$|E
25|$|Die {{deterioration}} doubling is {{a result}} of a few simple causes, but {{it can be difficult to}} positively identify. There are a number of different features which appear similar, but the characteristic traits of each are easy to identify with practice. Die deterioration doubling is often mistaken for hub doubling. The causes of the two types of doubling are different, but their appearance on the finished coin is often similar. Die deterioration doubling appears most often around the mintmark and date because they are alone in the field. When it occurs in other features, like an image of a bust, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a weak strike than doubling.|$|E

2500|$|The Neon was facelifted {{once again}} for 2003 with large [...] "crosseyed" [...] {{headlights}} and crosshair grille to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a Dodge Caravan and Dodge Stratus.|$|R
50|$|The {{developers}} at the Cambridge lab and CMU thought they'd {{get better}} reception from the C/C++ community out there if {{they changed the}} syntax to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> these languages.|$|R
2500|$|Opponents of dam removal {{have pointed}} out that the {{flooding}} of the Hetch Hetchy Valley has also deterred the crowds that overrun other areas of Yosemite National Park. Indeed, Hetch Hetchy today remains the least visited area of the park. Karin Klein has described Yosemite Valley as [...] "so crammed... that <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a ripstop ghetto than the site of a nature experience." [...] However, she does support breaching the dam once it has reached the end of its lifespan, and not replacing it.|$|E
6000|$|... "To me <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> marsh fires or St. Elmo lights, though {{how these}} can be {{where there is no}} vapour, I do not know," [...] I answered.|$|E
60|$|This Tale tells but indifferently, tho' indeed <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a Christian Fable, than a Pagan; {{because it}} seems as if made to honour the Christian Worship, and blast all the Pagan Idolatry; and for that Reason I reject it, the Christian Profession needing no such fabulous Stuff to confirm it.|$|E
50|$|The Guardian {{newspaper}} {{expressed the}} view that the statue also looked like the former White House press secretary Jay Carney and some people thought <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> him than <b>it</b> did Snowden.|$|R
60|$|Every thing was, however, on {{so small}} a scale, and so {{scrupulously}} neat and pretty, that <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a toy village than one {{built for the}} every-day residence of real men.|$|R
5000|$|Landwind {{was accused}} of replicating {{the design of the}} Range Rover Evoque when {{creating}} the X7. The outcome led to Landwind selling body kits for the X7, to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the Evoque.|$|R
6000|$|... "As a rule, I {{try to be}} truthful. The country {{strikes me}} as being pretty mixed, full of contrasts. There's this place, for instance; one could imagine they had meant to build a Greek temple, and now <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a swimming-bath. After {{planning}} the rest magnificently, why couldn't they put on a roof that wouldn't leak?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Marsa (anchorage) Damghah,[FN#10] {{or rather}} Dumayghah, is {{scarcely}} {{visible from the}} sea. An islet of limestone rock defends the entrance, leaving a narrow passage to the south. It is not before he enters that the mariner discovers the extent {{and the depth of}} this creek, which indents far into the land, and offers 15 to 20 feet of fine clear anchorage which no swell can reach. Inside <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a lake, and at night its colour is gloriously blue as Geneva itself. I could not help calling to mind, after dinner, the old school lines ...|$|E
60|$|If these Stories are explain'd here, and duly expos'd, and the History of Captain Avery {{set in a}} fairer Light, the End is answer'd; and of {{this the}} Readers are {{to be the only}} Judges: But this may be said, without any Arrogance, that this Story, stripp'd of all the romantick, improbable, and {{impossible}} Parts of <b>it,</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the History of Captain Avery, than any Thing yet publish'd ever has done; and, if it is not prov'd that the Captain wrote these Letters himself, the Publisher says, None but the Captain himself {{will ever be able to}} mend them.|$|E
5000|$|The Water Tower - may {{be mistaken}} for a {{battlefield}} look-out point but was only used to hold water. The top of the tower {{is an example of a}} crenellated adornment, making <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a castle than the roof of a water tower.|$|R
5|$|The Wembley Stadium {{scene in}} the film 28 Weeks Later was {{actually}} filmed at the Millennium Stadium. Although the outside is footage of Wembley, the inside is all filmed in Cardiff. The effects team on the film edited the footage to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Wembley.|$|R
6000|$|The minister's wife {{immediately}} responded. Miss Spencer {{lived in}} the fourth house beyond the [...] "Baptist church; the Baptist church was {{the one on the}} right, with that queer green thing over the door; they called it a portico, but <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> an old-fashioned bedstead.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} he's got {{good reason to}} cover his ears, like King Midas," [...] went on the priest, with a cheerful {{simplicity}} which somehow seemed rather flippant under the circumstances. [...] "I can quite understand that it's nicer to cover them with hair than with brass plates or leather flaps. But {{if he wants to}} use hair, why doesn't he make it look like hair? There never was hair of that colour in this world. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a sunset-cloud coming through the wood. Why doesn't he conceal the family curse better, if he's really so ashamed of it? Shall I tell you? It's because he isn't ashamed of it. He's proud of it" ...|$|E
60|$|Now, by all odds, {{the most}} ancient extant {{portrait}} anyways purporting to be the whale's, {{is to be found}} in the famous cavern-pagoda of Elephants, in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the broad palms of the true whale's majestic flukes.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis a goodly castle for its size," [...] {{the knight}} said, {{as he drew}} rein and turned his horse so that his dame might {{get a better view}} of it. [...] "There is a dry moat, which is lined with stonework. The walls are not very high, but they are well defended by those {{flanking}} towers, and the place could stand any sudden assault. I should say that it was about the same strength as our own. So far as I can see, the other arrangements are quite different. There is no keep, {{and it seems to me}} that the house is built rather for comfort than for defence; the windows are large, and <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a Flemish house built within a castle wall than an English place of strength. Now let us ride on," [...] and they pressed their horses forward. The gates were thrown open when they approached within a hundred yards; the drawbridge over the moat had been already lowered.|$|E
60|$|There was no {{illumination}} of {{the windows}} tonight. From roof to basement not a light twinkled {{in any part of}} the great building. Its huge mass loomed up dark and sullen amid the trees which surrounded <b>it,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> some giant sarcophagus than a human habitation.|$|R
2500|$|Spencer also {{invented a}} {{precursor}} to the modern paper clip, though <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a modern cotter pin. This [...] "binding-pin" [...] was distributed by Ackermann & Company. Spencer shows drawings of the pin in Appendix I (following Appendix H) of his autobiography along with published descriptions of its uses.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the movie F.I.S.T. was filmed in Dubuque. Sylvester Stallone starred {{in this film}} as a trucker who compromises his {{principles}} as he moves up through the labor union organization. Dubuque was chosen because without TV antennas <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Cleveland of the 1930s than Cleveland did.|$|R
60|$|In one corner, and {{standing}} in a leafy and grassy shelter somewhat away from the vegetables, is the poet's tomb, which {{has a kind of}} claim to genuineness by virtue of its improbable appearance. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a bake-oven than even the Pompeian tombs; the masonry is antique, and is at least in skillful imitation of the fine Roman work. The interior is a small chamber with vaulted or wagon-roof ceiling, under which a man may stand upright, and at the end next the street is a little stone commemorating the place as Virgil's tomb, which was placed there by the Queen of France in 1840, and said by the custodian (a singularly dull ass) to be an exact copy of the original, whatever the original may have been. This guide could tell us nothing more about it, and was too stupidly honest to pretend to know more. The laurel planted by Petrarch {{at the door of the}} tomb, and renewed in later times by Casimir Delavigne, has been succeeded by a third laurel. The present twig was so slender, and looked so friendless and unprotected, that even enthusiasm for the memory of two poets could not be brought to rob it of one of its few leaves; and we contented ourselves with plucking some of the grass and weeds that grew abundantly on the roof of the tomb.|$|E
50|$|After the British left India in 1947, Government {{has largely}} chosen to ignore this area, {{and as a}} result Behat has made little {{progress}} in last 70 years or so. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a big village than a town.|$|E
50|$|A micro-sized Ravage {{comes with}} the 2-inch Soundwave toy in the Smallest Transformers line. Though this is the {{smallest}} Ravage toy ever made, its robot mode does not remotely resemble the character; rather, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a jigsaw puzzle piece with legs.|$|E

50|$|A {{previous}} {{technique used}} was to reconstruct walls {{and other features}} of the site {{in order to make}} <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> did when in use, however that has been mostly going out of style and instead the preservation of how the site was found is growing greater and greater in importance.|$|R
50|$|As {{the hall}} was {{considered}} to be unsympathetic in appearance to the local countryside, it was decided to change its exterior. This was designed by the Percy Thomas Partnership. Work on recasing the Dennys Hall to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a French château began in 1989 and was completed in 1991.|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{creature}} depicted {{in a little}} picture on the Angkor Wat which some have said resembles a Stegosaurus. [...] Others {{have pointed out that}} <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a chameleon or a Mountain Horned Dragon, both found in that area.|$|E

50|$|The crested treeswift feeds in the air, {{living on}} the insects it catches in its bill. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a swallow in flight than a swift, but is {{unrelated}} to that group. Unlike the true swifts, the treeswifts readily rest on high bare tree branches.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, the {{magazine}} adopted a new, glossier cover format, based around a central image and tagline, making <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the Georgetown Journal of International Affairs or Foreign Policy {{as opposed to}} the staid, text-only covers of Foreign Affairs or Commentary. The magazine also added daily online content to its website.|$|R
40|$|Perhaps you {{remember}} the old brick horticultural barn back of Chemistry building. <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a lovely English cottage than a barn, and now at last it has grown up to its appearance! Last summer, with much hammering and sawing, the building {{was transformed into a}} completely modern and altogether delightful nursery school...|$|R
5000|$|Lackey {{lives with}} her husband Larry Dixon outside of Tulsa, Oklahoma, in an unusual house. She {{describes}} it as a [...] "2½-story concrete dome with an octagonal wooden shell over it to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a normal house ... it's round with curved outer walls, which makes placement of furniture kind of awkward." ...|$|R
