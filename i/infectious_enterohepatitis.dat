With the recent availability of furazolidone, such a test was warranted. While this drug was offered for the control of some Salmonella infections and <b>infectious</b> <b>enterohepatitis,</b> there was some indication that it might be effective for the control of coccidiosis. It was with primary reference to this latter disease that the tests herein reported were conducted. EXPERIMENTAL Three experiments have been conducted in which various coccidiostatic drugs have been tested to determine their efficacy in improving the growth rate of fryer chicks maintained on previously used, built-up litter. The litter in the house was origi-nally new wood shavings. The first of 3 experiments was conducted after the litter had been used to raise 3 groups of fryers to 11 weeks of age. The 2 nd and 3 rd ex-periments represented the Sth and 6 th use of the litter without changing or adding new litter. Hydrated lime had been adde...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Histomoniasis (<b>infectious</b> <b>enterohepatitis)</b> is {{a disease}} of broiler chickens, turkeys and game fowl which are reared on litter or exposed to range. It {{is caused by the}} {{protozoan}} organism Histomonas meleagridis. Histomonads are spread in chicken feces, Heterakis gallinarum (cecal worm) eggs or earthworms. Symptoms may include: poor feed conversion ratio and body weight, diarrhea with sulfur-colored droppings, cecal and liver lesions, darkening of the facial regions and sometimes death. Morbidity, mortality and culling may reach 20 % in chickens. In the U. S. A., nitarsone (4 -nitrophenyl-arsonic acid; Histostat, Alpharma, Inc., Fort Lee, NJ) is used as an aid in prevention of histomoniasis. In this trial,® Natustat ™ (Alltech, Inc., Nicholasville, KY), a proprietary plant derived product, was used at 1. 925 kg/Tonne and compared with nitarsone in the diets of unsexed Hubbard HiY broiler chicks to 42 d of age on histomonad infected litter from broiler breeders. Infected and uninfected control groups were also included. There were 4 pens each containing 150 chicks (unreplicated live performance) and 25 birds per pen were randomly sampled at 28, 35 and 42 d of age for cecal (0 - 4) and liver lesion (0 - 3) scoring. The histomonad infected litter group had significantly elevated cecal and liver lesion scores compared to the uninfected control group, indicating the challenge model was effective. At each sampling point, Natustat ™ was statistically equivalent to nitarsone for lowering cecal or liver lesion scores and these treatments gave results significantly better than infected control...|$|E
40|$|Heterakis gallinae, the caecal worm of poultry, was {{described}} by Taylor (35) as "as perfect a parasite as {{can be found in}} that it does no harm to its host". In its normal host, Gallus gallus, the adult stages of the parasite are found in the lumen of the caeca. The larval stages may be found in the lumina and epithelium of the caecal glands as late as the seventh day following infection but usually no tissue invasion is present beyond the tenth day. The degree of typhlitis produced by the larval invasion is variable, depending on the degree of infection. The economic importance of the parasite came to light through the work of Graybill and Smith (19). They demonstrated that blackhead could be produced by feeding embryonated heterakid eggs to turkey poults. In the caeca this nematode acquires the protozoan Histomonas meleagridis, incriminated as the aetiological agent of <b>infectious</b> <b>enterohepatitis.</b> How the protozoa invade the caecal worm or the form taken by the protozoa in the nemic egg has not yet been explained, but in view of the volume of circumstantial evidence, the belief that these phenomena do occur is accepted by the majority of parasitologists. Not all members of this species of roundworm are capable of acting as vectors of the protozoan disease. Tyzzer (36) was able to produce a blackhead-free strain of H. gallinae. This strain was attained by passage in chicks for several generations. Connell (12) located a source of blackhead-free heterakids in Saskatchewan. [ [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|Histomonosis (blackhead {{disease or}} <b>infectious</b> <b>enterohepatitis)</b> {{caused by the}} {{extracellular}} protozoon parasite Histomonas meleagridis is an important disease of turkeys and {{a threat to the}} poultry industry. Due to recent legislation on drug restrictions, research to find new alternatives is an urgent matter in the battle against histomonosis. In the present study, intracloacal inoculation of a low-virulent H. meleagridis strain isolated after serial passages in turkeys clearly demonstrated a reduction of virulence and hence its effectiveness as a vaccine against histomonosis. The low-virulent isolate has been evaluated in a comparative experimental infection study. No mortality nor predominant caecal or liver lesions could be observed in the groups inoculated with 10 (3), 10 (4) or 10 (5) histomonads per bird. Only dilated caeca with a yellow and foamy content could be noticed. Groups inoculated with similar doses of a virulent strain displayed a dose-related pathology and mortality up to 100 %. The protective capacity of the strain with reduced virulence could be demonstrated as none of the birds cloacally inoculated with 10 (3), 10 (4) or 10 (5) histomonads died upon challenge with 10 (5) H. meleagridis of the virulent strain. Hereby, 71 % of the challenge control group died. Interestingly, no or only very minor pathological lesions in the caeca and liver could be detected after challenge of the birds inoculated with the passaged histomonads. In conclusion, cloacal inoculation of the low-virulent strain obtained after serial backpassages was able to induce protection of turkeys against challenge with a virulent H. meleagridis strain. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Histomonosis (blackhead or <b>infectious</b> <b>enterohepatitis)</b> is {{a disease}} of gallinaceous birds, {{especially}} of turkeys, and {{is caused by the}} protozoan Histomonas meleagridis. Since the ban of all chemoprophylactic and chemotherapeutic products against this disease in the European Union, this parasite causes a considerable amount of economical problems in the poultry industry. Research which could ultimately lead to the discovery of new drugs against this disease is thus highly necessary. Hence, in this study, the efficacy of paromomycin against histomonosis in turkeys was investigated. First, the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of this drug against H. meleagridis and its effect on the weight gain of turkeys was determined. Adding paromomycin to the feed (400 ppm as well as 200 ppm paromomycin) or to the drinking water (420 mg paromomycin per liter water, added prior to or on the day of challenge) significantly lowered the mortality rate and the caecal and liver lesion scores after an intracloacal infection compared to infected untreated birds. However, when paromomycin was administered to turkeys in the drinking water after the challenge, no significant differences in mortality or in lesion scores could be observed compared to the infected untreated control group. This demonstrates that paromomycin exerts a purely preventive action against histomonosis in turkeys. Additionally, the weight gain of the treated birds was positively influenced by the use of the drug, as the average weight gain of all treated groups (except for the group treated at the day of first mortality) was significantly higher than that of the untreated control group. Finally, the target site of paromomycin was detected in the SS rRNA gene of H. meleagridis. Consequently, the susceptibility to paromomycin can be correlated to the presence of the binding site of the drug at the 3 ' end of the small subunit rRNA gene of the parasite. In conclusion, paromomycin {{can be used as a}} new prophylactic measure in the control of histomonosis in turkeys. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Histomonas meleagridis is {{a single}} {{eukaryotic}} microorganism causing <b>infectious</b> <b>enterohepatitis</b> in galliform birds with high mortality, notably in turkeys. This fastidious disease is also called ‘histomonosis’. Upon initial infection, the protozoan flagellate H. meleagridis resides in the bird caeca and multiplies in the caecal lumen from where the protozoa will infiltrate the host intestinal tissue. Proceeding the breakthrough of the caeca, H. meleagridis adopts an amoeboid form and migrates to the host liver through the portal vein, developing liver necrosis. As such the protozoal movement to the host liver and hence its rapid proliferation are considered as crucial factors determining the disease pathogenesis and outcome in bird species. Interestingly, in chickens a more effective innate immune response in the caecal tonsils limits the protozoal migration and therefore liver involvement, whereas in turkeys the early immune response failed. While the mortality rate can mount up to 100 % in turkeys, chickens usually recover and eventually become healthy carriers. However, rare cases of recovered turkeys and different susceptibility to H. meleagridis infection between chicken lines have been reported. H. meleagridis is most often transmitted between birds via embryonated eggs of the caecal bird nematode Heterakis gallinarum or through uptake of an intermediate carrier for the nematode itself harbouring the protozoa. Alternatively H. meleagridis can be directly transmitted within a flock through a physiological process known as ‘cloacal drinking’ by taking up fresh caecal droppings infected with H. meleagridis via the cloaca. Spreading by oral intake has been speculated as a third transmission way. Histomonosis {{is a good example}} of how delicate the balance between protecting consumers and sustainable livestock production can be. Due to animal welfare considerations since 2012 (CouncilDirective 1999 / 74 /EC 1999) the common use of indoor housing systems for laying hens has been strictly limited. Housing hens in alternative systems (eg. enriched cages) and more interest in free-range rearing of poultry have increased the risk for exposing numerous flocks to soils contaminated with the nematode and therefore to H. meleagridis parasites (McDougald 2005). Thereby, the nearly complete ban of effective prophylactics and therapeutics in EU and USA against histomonosis since 1995, left the poultry industry vulnerable for infections with H. meleagridis leading to the re-emergence of the disease. The latter spurred the R&D efforts for new control measures directed against H. meleagridis. Despite the recent intensification of research, in-depth knowledge of the parasite itself and its interaction with its host and environment is still lacking. Hence, developing new control measures against H. meleagridis is still hampered. In addition, therapeutic treatment of birds already showing the first clinical signs is too late and inevitably leads to mortality within a few days following treatment. Presumption of histomonosis is generally based on observation of clinical signs around 5 - 12 days upon experimental intracloacal infection, coinciding with voiding of H. meleagridis, caecal burst, migration and infection of the liver by the parasites. Available treatments are not able to instigate full recovery of the host once the liver is infected. Hence, it is important to develop new measures to control H. meleagridis. Moreover, vaccination becomes a more and more appealing approach in the prevention of histomonosis. Taking into account of this jeopardy, my thesis was aimed at identifying candidate antigens of H. meleagridis for future development of potential vaccines to control histomonosis in poultry flocks, especially turkeys. In Chapter Two, the establishment of a well-specified mono-eukaryotic H. meleagridis culture, which is a prerequisite for further in-depth investigations, is described. Liver lesions of H. meleagridis infected birds were isolated and inoculated into culture media pre-incubated with caecal bacteria. In addition, in a kinetic study using transmission electron microscopy the deleterious effects of adventitious protozoa including Tetratrichomonas gallinarum and Blastocystis spp. on cultured H. meleagridis were examined. The occurrence of these latter protozoa in the caeca of birds impedes however the isolation and propagation of H. meleagridis from field outbreaks. Nevertheless, the necessity of the co-cultivation of caecal bacterial flora for the in vitro multiplication of H. meleagridis has been underlined. Furthermore, after successful propagation and maintenance of the in vitro cultured H. meleagridis, its unaltered pathogenicity was affirmed in an infection experiment in turkeys. This method of producing pure H. meleagridis cultures provides an important tool to gain more in-depth information about the protozoon H. meleagridis itself. Moreover, the mono-eukaryotic culture could reveal questions about the interactions between H. meleagridis and its bacterial environment in the culture or in the host. In Chapter Three, H. meleagridis cells have been successfully separated from a mono-eukaryotic culture co-propagated with host caecal bacteria by using means of flow cytometry. A proteomic analysis of H. meleagridis with two-dimentionsal gelelectrophoresis (2 DGE) has been used for further in-depth studies unraveling the pathogenesis of H. meleagridis. The enrichment of H. meleagridis was confirmed through transmission electron microscopy. Through cross-species analysis and search against the NCBI database several 2 DGE protein spots were identified as cytoskeletal proteins. Actin microfilaments are known to be a key player in cell spreading, cell adhesion, phagocytosis, signal transduction and several other processes. Thereby, it has been reported that H. meleagridis α-actinins have demonstrated antigenicity to serum of their most important host, in particular turkey and chicken. Together with the identification of a superoxide dismutase, the resulted information generated from proteome analysis may also serve as a foundation for comparative proteome analysis on the pathogenesis, virulence factors, and ultimately drug development. Chapter Four represents an infection study whereby intracloacal inoculation of a low-virulent H. meleagridis strain isolated after serial backpassages in turkeys clearly demonstrated a reduction of virulence and hence its protective effectiveness against histomonosis. The pathogenicity of a backpassaged H. meleagridis strain after serial in vivo back passages was assessed in a comparative infection study in turkeys. No mortality nor predominant caecal or liver lesions were observed in the groups inoculated with the backpassaged H. meleagridis. Groups inoculated with similar doses of a virulent strain displayed a dose-related pathology and mortality up to 100 %. Subsequently, cloacal inoculation of the backpassaged H. meleagridis strain was able to induce protection of turkeys against challenge with a virulent H. meleagridis strain. No or only very minor pathological lesions in the caeca and liver could be detected after challenge of the birds inoculated with the backpassaged histomonads while the mortality rate was high in the challenge control group. The development of a low-virulent H. meleagridis offers an important tool for further investigations to unravel the protective immunity upon inoculation with attenuated histomonads in order to improve vaccination efficiency against histomonosis. Briefly, in this thesis work valuable tools have been developed providing a basis for further research on the parasite H. meleagridis itself, on its interaction with bacteria and with the host in the battle against histomonosis. Although many research venues still remain unexplored, several researchers have obtained tremendous progress in knowledge about H. meleagridis over the last decades. Hoping now that researchers remain to seize H. meleagridis as to the infectious disease ‘histomonosis’ does not reemerge over time. status: publishe...|$|E
