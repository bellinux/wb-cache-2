5|$|In May 1985, {{designers}} {{started work}} on the F1 project. In late 1985, designers presented the first exterior study models to F1 management, featuring a sports car-like design with a low-slung hood and narrow <b>front</b> <b>profile.</b> By 1986, the sedan used a three-box design with an upright stance, more prominent grille, and a two-tone body. Extensive modeling and wind tunnel tests resulted in a low drag coefficient for a conventional production vehicle of the time (C'd 0.29). For the passenger cabin, the materials-selection tests evaluated 24 different kinds of wood and multiple types of leather {{for two years before}} settling on specific trim combinations. By 1986, the Lexus marque was created to support the launch of the flagship sedan, and the vehicle became known as the Lexus LS. Following eight design reviews, subsequent revisions, concept approval in September 1986, and over US$1 billion in development expenses, the final design for the production Lexus LS 400 (chassis code UCF10) was frozen in May 1987 with design patents filed on 13 May 1987.|$|E

25|$|The Venturer II had {{a common}} <b>front</b> <b>profile</b> for all models, {{together}} with a standard dash panel featuring a four-part radiator grille with a central cross within an oval outline which also embraced the headlamps. A rear-end revision marked {{the launch of the}} Venturer III in 1954, and the following year a version was produced for underfloor-engined chassis with the entrance ahead of the front axle. This required a return to a more vertical <b>front</b> <b>profile,</b> and meant that there were now three variants of the Venturer – front engined, underfloor-engined with a centre entrance and underfloor-engined with a front entrance. This three-variant approach, established with the Venturer, continued throughout the life of the succeeding Consort model and into the Embassy era, although the relative importance of the three versions varied significantly over the years.|$|E

40|$|In this investigation, a {{one-dimensional}} {{hydrodynamic model}} that includes river ice formation and melting processes is developed {{and used to}} conduct a preliminary assessment of climate change impact on the ice regime of the Peace River in Alberta. The model employs an Eulerian frame of reference for both the flow hydrodynamics and the ice processes (ice cover formation and deterioration) and uses the characteristic-dissipative-Galerkin finite element method to solve the primary equations. This paper details the model formulation and its application to the Peace River. Model calibration and validation results with historical data are presented; these indicate that the present model adequately simulates water temperature and ice <b>front</b> <b>profiles.</b> However, its further development to include certain dynamic freeze-up processes is required to refine the ice front results. Higher air temperatures predicted by the CGCM 2 climate model were used to generate future ice <b>front</b> <b>profiles</b> that correspond to the historical runs. This preliminary climate change impact analysis {{suggests that there is}} a significant potential for a shorter ice-covered season on the Peace River by the mid-twenty-first century. At the Town of Peace River, the average total reduction in ice cover duration is 28 days (31 %) under the scenario applied. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{perform a}} linear {{stability}} {{analysis of the}} periodic crenellated <b>front</b> <b>profiles</b> which provide an amplitude threshold for the cellular instability of a faceted directional solidification front [1]. This analysis assumes that facets are much longer than curved parts of the front (risers).

2500|$|Although {{the basic}} engine format had changed little since 1948, {{the lack of}} a {{radiator}} and the low profile of the boxer-motor configuration made it possible for the Panhard to achieve an exceptionally low and streamlined front end that sat well with more recent styling trends. [...] (Citroën's own DS design, constrained by the taller profile of its more conventional water-cooled unit, achieved a similarly wind cheating <b>front</b> <b>profile</b> only be setting the engine some forty centimetres back {{from the front of the}} car: the DS19 used essentially the power unit of the Traction Avant, applying a front-wheel-drive layout with the engine set directly behind the front wheels and the clutch and gearbox ahead of the engine.) ...|$|E

After completing the Benetton B192 for the [...] season (with assistance from Rory Byrne and Ross Brawn), in which future 7 time World Champion Michael Schumacher would take his first ever Grand Prix win in Belgium, Barnard left Benetton after a dispute with team boss Flavio Briatore over money.|$|E
2500|$|Plaxtons built {{a number}} of {{different}} coach designs through the 1930s, until settling on a distinctive house style. The style typically consisted of a very rounded <b>front</b> <b>profile</b> at the windscreen area with side windows that sloped backwards at the front, were upright at the centre, and sloped forward at the back. Bodywork for the Bedford WTB chassis was particularly distinctive, sloping severally {{from the bottom of the}} front wheel arch to the roofline, leaving the [...] "bullnose" [...] radiator grille protruding. The rear also sloped prominently. The WTB chassis was very popular choice for operators at that time, together with the Dodge RBF and SBF. Leyland and AEC chassis were also popular for larger coaches, notably the Leyland Tiger and AEC Regal.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} describes NIST Special Database 18, {{which contains}} 8 -bit gray scale images of mugshot photographs. This database is being distributed {{for use in}} developing and testing of mugshot identification systems. The database contains images of 1573 individuals (cases) {{with a total of}} 3248 images stored in NIST's IHead raster data format. The mugshots are mainly of male cases, with the database containing 1495 male cases and 78 female cases. The sex and age of each individual are stored in the header of each file as well as an included log file. The included log file also gives information about which files are of the same individual (see section 5). The database images consist of both front views and side views (profiles), although not every case has both a <b>front</b> and <b>profile.</b> Looking at the <b>front</b> views and <b>profiles</b> separately, there are 131 cases with two or more front views and 1418 with only one front view. There are 89 cases with two or more profiles and 1268 with only one profile. In cases that have both <b>fronts</b> and <b>profiles,</b> there are only 89 cases with two or more of both <b>fronts</b> and <b>profiles,</b> 27 with two or more <b>fronts</b> and one <b>profile,</b> and 1217 with only one <b>front</b> and one <b>profile.</b> The size of each image varies, because the mugshot photographs vary in size from 1 " - 2 1 / 2 " in height. Rather than storing an image that was more than 50 % background pixels, some of the background was discarded. All of the images except for 43 were scanned at 19. 685 pixels/mm (500 dpi).

2500|$|Two {{new models}} were {{exhibited}} at the 1950 Commercial Motor Show, with names instead of model codes for the first time. The Envoy was for traditional front-engined chassis, and featured a full-front cab with a vee-pattern windscreen, and aluminium trim across {{the lower part of}} the radiator grill extending around squared-off front corners to the wheel arches. The Crusader, which could be built on the traditional front-engined chassis or the new underfloor-engined chassis, had a more upright <b>front</b> <b>profile,</b> with curved glass panels at the windscreen corners, and in most cases an enlarged side window with sloping pillars between this and the entrance. With the front-engined chassis, the Crusader employed the Envoy's front trim. Both the Envoy and Crusader were produced to the new maximum dimensions of [...] by , and many examples were originally fitted with rear wheel spats.|$|E

In this Letter, however, evidence is given that merely a slip-boundary condition at the solid-liquid interface can lead to an asymmetric profile. Variation of molecular weight shows that slippage is directly linked to chain entanglements. We find a reduced entanglement density at the solid-liquid interface (factors 3 to 4), which stresses the importance of considering nonbulk polymer properties in the vicinity of an interface...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{the present}} paper, some {{interesting}} questions concerning 3 D fatigue crack propagation are discussed. The main {{focus is on}} experimental investigations of 3 D fatigue crack propagation under Mode I loading conditions. Transparent specimens of PMMA are used, {{in order to be}} able to observe and to document accurate sequences of the real 3 D crack <b>front</b> evolution <b>profiles</b> via in situ photographic measurement. Such well documented experimentally observed sequences of real crack <b>front</b> <b>profiles</b> are necessary to identify an appropriate crack propagation criterion via comparing the experimental observations with corresponding numerical simulations. The aim of this paper is to present a new 3 D crack propagation criterion, based on simple 2 D fatigue tests on CT specimens, which allows to predict the correct distribution of the incre-mental crack extension also for complicated loading conditions under which only parts of the crack front propagate. Another focus of the experimental investigations concerns the influence of the additional corner singularities in the case of surface breaking cracks. Results of both, numerical simulations of 3 D fatigue crack propagation an cor-responding experimental investigations, are presented...|$|R
40|$|We study {{reaction}} fronts {{described by}} the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation subject to a Poiseuille flow. The fronts propagate with or against the flow located inside a two-dimensional slab. Steady <b>front</b> <b>profiles</b> can be flat, axisymmetric, or nonaxisymmetric, depending on {{the gap between the}} plates and the average flow speed. We first obtain the steady front solutions, later executing a linear stability analysis to determine the stability of the fronts. Applying fluid flow can turn initially unstable fronts into stable fronts. Stable steady fronts propagating in the adverse direction of the Poiseuille flow are axisymmetric for slow fluid flows. However, for higher speeds an adverse flow can lead to stable nonaxisymmetric fronts. We also show regions of bistability where stable nonaxisymmetric and axisymmetric fronts can coexis...|$|R

The full text may be available through the publisher links provided above. The macroscopic electromagnetic behaviour of a type-II superconducting wire for alternating current power transmission under constant magnetic field conditions is captured by the numerical solution of the Maxwell equations under the framework of the critical state principle and the so-called integral formulation, also known as J-formulation. Time-dependent distributions for the flux <b>front</b> <b>profiles</b> of local current density, magnetic flux, and cycles of magnetic moment are presented. We have found that, regardless of the intensity of the applied magnetic field, the first cycle of Itr(t) defines the period of magnetic stabilization of the SC wire where two plateaus with constant magnetic moment can be measured. Then, a cyclic monotonic behaviour with well-defined flux-front boundaries has been identified, with clear signatures of current-like and field-like flux <b>front</b> <b>profiles.</b> This observation has allowed us to establish semi-analytical approaches of flux-tracking for the local dynamics of current density of AC SC wires immersed in a constant transverse magnetic field, from which all the macroscopical electromagnetic quantities of interest such as the magnetic field, magnetic moment, and power density of energy losses can be calculated. The observations reported define an adequate benchmark for developing flux-tracking approaches in other 2 D symmetries, such as SC strips.
