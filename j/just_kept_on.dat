[...] He has a fourth pitch, a slider, that lacks consistent break and darts horizontally {{similar to the}} cutter. [...] Wacha attributed the increase in pitch velocity to gaining weight from physical exercise and increased food consumption, asserting that he [...] "felt like the velocity <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> increasing every single year. [...] I changed my mechanics a little bit when I was in college, and that might have added a few ticks." [...] Wacha added a cut fastball (commonly called a [...] "cutter") late in the 2013 season, though he only threw the pitch 1.8% of the time. [...] During the 2014 spring training, Wacha showed increased confidence in the pitch after finding a consistent grip.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I'd left Red Jacket and Cornplanter riding {{home with}} me after Big Hand had said that there wouldn't be any war. That's {{all there was to}} it. We {{believed}} Big Hand and we went home again--we three braves. When we reached Lebanon we found Toby at the cottage with his waistcoat a foot too big for him--so hard he had worked amongst the yellow-fever people. He beat me for running off with the Indians, but 'twas worth it--I was glad to see him,--and when we went back to Philadelphia for the winter, and I was told how he'd sacrificed himself over sick people in the yellow fever, I thought the world and all of him. No, I didn't neither. I'd thought that all along. That yellow fever must have been something dreadful. Even in December people had no more than begun to trinkle back to town. Whole houses stood empty and the niggers was robbing them out. But I can't call to mind that any of the Moravian Brethren had died. It seemed like they had <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> with their own concerns, and the good Lord He'd just looked after 'em. That was the winter--yes, winter of 'Ninety-three--the Brethren bought a stove for the church. Toby spoke in favour of it because the cold spoiled his fiddle hand, but many thought stove-heat not in the Bible, and there was yet a third party which always brought hickory coal foot-warmers to service and wouldn't speak either way. They ended by casting the Lot for it, which is like pitch-and-toss. After my summer with the Senecas, church-stoves didn't highly interest me, so I took to haunting round among the French emigres which Philadelphia was full of. My French and my fiddling helped me there, d'ye see. They come over in shiploads from France, where, by what I made out, every one was killing every one else by any means, and they spread 'emselves about the city--mostly in Drinker's Alley and Elfrith's Alley--and they did odd jobs till times should mend. But whatever they stooped to, they were gentry and kept a cheerful countenance, and after an evening's fiddling at one of their poor little proud parties, the Brethren seemed old-fashioned. Pastor Meder and Brother Adam Goos didn't like my fiddling for hire, but Toby said it was lawful in me to earn my living by exercising my talents. He never let me be put upon.|$|E
6000|$|Afterwards {{he came to}} have a bolder spirit about it, and he went {{hunting with}} it a good deal. It was a very curious kind of gun; you had to snap a good many caps on it, {{sometimes}}, before the load would go off; and sometimes it would hang fire, and then seem to recollect itself, and go off, maybe, just when {{you were going to}} take it down from your shoulder. The barrel was so crooked that it could not shoot straight, but this was not the only reason why the boy never hit anything with it. He could not shut his left eye and keep his right eye open; so he had to take aim with both eyes, or else with the left eye, which was worse yet, till one day when he was playing shinny (or hockey) at school, and got a blow over his left eye from a shinny-stick. At first he thought his eye was put out; he could not see for the blood that poured into it from the cut above it. He ran homeward wild with fear, but on the way he stopped at a pump to wash away the blood, and then he found his eye was safe. It suddenly came into his mind to try if he could not shut that eye now, and keep the right one open. He found that he could do it perfectly; by help of his handkerchief, he stanched his wound, and made himself presentable, with the glassy pool before the pump for a mirror, and went joyfully back to school. He kept trying his left eye, to make sure it had not lost its new-found art, and as soon as school was out he hurried home to share the joyful news with his family. He went hunting the very next Saturday, and at the first shot he killed a bird. It was a suicidal sap-sucker, which had suffered him to steal upon it so close that it could not escape even the vagaries of that wandering gun-barrel, and was blown into such small pieces that the boy could bring only a few feathers of it away. In the evening, when his father came home, he showed him these trophies of the chase, and boasted of his exploit with the minutest detail. His father asked him whether he had expected to eat this sap-sucker, if he could have got enough of it together. He said no, sap-suckers were not good to eat. [...] "Then you took its poor little life merely for the pleasure of killing it," [...] said the father. [...] "Was it a great pleasure to see it die?" [...] The boy hung his head in shame and silence; {{it seemed to him that}} he would never go hunting again. Of course he did go hunting often afterwards, but his brother and he kept faithfully to the rule of never killing anything that they did not want to eat. To be sure, they gave themselves a wide range; they were willing to eat almost anything that they could shoot, even blackbirds, which were so abundant and so easy to shoot. But there were some things which they would have thought it not only wanton but wicked to kill, like turtle-doves, which they somehow believed were sacred, because they were the symbols of the Holy Ghost; it was quite their own notion to hold them sacred. They would not kill robins either, because robins were hallowed by poetry, and they kept about the house, and were almost tame, so that it seemed a shame to shoot them. They were very plentiful, and so were the turtle-doves, which used to light on the basin-bank, and pick up the grain scattered there from the boats and wagons. One of the apprentices in the printing-office kept a shot-gun loaded beside the press while he was rolling, and whenever he caught the soft twitter that the doves make with their wings, he rushed out with his gun and knocked over two or three of them. He was a good shot, and could nearly always get them in range. When he brought them back, it seemed to my boy that he had committed the unpardonable sin, and that something awful would surely happen to him. But he <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> rolling the forms of type and exchanging insults with the pressman; and at the first faint twitter of doves' wings he would be off again.|$|E
