5|$|Armed {{hostilities}} {{during the}} Black Hawk War began at Stillman's Run, and the victory was unexpected for Black Hawk and his British Band. Black Hawk {{feared that the}} white militia and <b>its</b> <b>allies</b> would seek revenge through his total defeat. Leading his starving band, Black Hawk fled from Atkinson's pursuing army. The chase would take them as far as present day Madison, Wisconsin. It ended at the Battle of Bad Axe, where the militia and <b>its</b> <b>allies</b> massacred a weakened foe, by then made up of mostly women and children.|$|E

5|$|In addition, the {{shortage}} of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon <b>its</b> <b>allies</b> (socii) {{for the provision of}} allied troops. Where accepted allies could not provide the required force types, the Romans were not averse during this period to hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the {{successful}} campaign to recapture Guadalcanal from the Japanese {{was an important}} strategic victory for the U.S. and <b>its</b> <b>allies.</b> Building on their success at Guadalcanal and elsewhere, the Allies continued their campaign against Japan, ultimately culminating in Japan's defeat {{and the end of}} World War II.|$|E

5|$|The great {{rivalry between}} these two cities may {{have been based on}} more than {{competition}} for resources. Their dynastic histories reveal different origins and the intense competition between the two powers may have had an ideological grounding. Calakmul's dynasty seems ultimately derived from the great Preclassic city of El Mirador while the dynasty of Tikal was profoundly affected by the intervention of the distant central Mexican metropolis of Teotihuacan. With few exceptions, Tikal's monuments and those of <b>its</b> <b>allies</b> place great emphasis upon single male rulers while the monuments of Calakmul and <b>its</b> <b>allies</b> gave greater prominence to the female line and often the joint rule of king and queen.|$|E

5|$|A quick {{peace was}} {{essential}} to keep Russia from entering the conflict on Austria's side. Prussia annexed Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, Nassau, {{and the city of}} Frankfurt. Hesse Darmstadt lost some territory but not its sovereignty.

Jasaw Chan K'awiil I and his heir Yik'in Chan K'awiil continued hostilities against Calakmul and <b>its</b> <b>allies</b> and imposed firm regional control over the area around Tikal, extending as far as the territory around Lake Petén Itzá. These two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today.|$|E
