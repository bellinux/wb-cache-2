25|$|Following {{from this}} kind of thought Munch thus {{considered}} a territorial defence of Denmark impossible, and <b>illusions</b> <b>about</b> this downright dangerous.

These ideas stayed with him throughout his political career, and he would manage to stamp them quite firmly on Danish Foreign Policy.|$|E

Traditionally Finland had been associated with Britain by stronger commercial ties, but as the Baltic Sea was dominated by the Germans and Soviets, lost markets had to be found elsewhere, and the Germans were willing to trade.|$|E

These anarthas are required to be uprooted in order to develop niśṭa (devotion). But, bhrama is not an āropa (imposing of, imputation, figurative substitution) which is an āhārya (wilfully caused in spite of falsity) cognition.|$|R

25|$|Few Chinese had any <b>illusions</b> <b>about</b> Japanese {{designs on}} China.

After 1940, conflicts between the Kuomintang and Communists became more frequent in the areas not under Japanese control.

25|$|In 2010, {{a fierce}} debate {{occurred}} about {{the rate of}} profit between leading Marxist economists from various political organizations in Western Europe and North America. According to the French Marxist economist Michel Husson, there were basically four bones of contention: (1) how had the average rate of profit in industries evolved since the early 1980s, in the larger developed capitalist countries? (2) what is the theoretical status of the tendential fall {{in the rate of}} profit in the Marxist analysis? (3) {{what is the nature of}} the capitalist crisis today? (4) what is the political relevance of this discussion? However, there was very little agreement about concepts, measurement principles, and political perspectives among participants. According to some (like Michel Husson) the rate of profit had gone up again since 1980, while others (like Andrew Kliman) thought it had stayed down. All kinds of different political conclusions were being drawn from the econometric evidence. The traditional orthodox Marxist narrative is that capitalist crises are crises of profitability: the economic disturbance is caused by the circumstance that capitalists are making insufficient profits, and not because there are insufficient goods for everybody. That situation is bound to happen, because of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. Once workers understand that, they can break with <b>illusions</b> <b>about</b> reforming capitalism, and prepare for revolution. Critics point out, however, that this kind of interpretation is problematic. There are two main reasons.|$|E

500|$|At {{his meeting}} with Mulgrave, Cochrane was asked to explain a plan of attack on Basque Roads which he had drawn up some years previously.

Cochrane was in poor health, and under no <b>illusions</b> <b>about</b> Mulgrave's intentions: should the attack fail Cochrane would be blamed and his political career damaged. In addition, Cochrane was also {{well aware of the}} fury this decision would provoke in the naval hierarchy; the appointment of a relatively junior officer in command of such an important operation was calculated to cause offense. Cochrane refused, even though Mulgrave pleaded that he had been the only officer to present a practical plan for attacking Allemand's fleet. Again Cochrane refused the command, but the following day Mulgrave issued a direct order: [...] "My Lord you must go. The board cannot listen to further refusal or delay.

[...] However, her international reputation and even her position at home were imperilled by the scandal, {{which seems to have}} convinced her that she could not risk a marriage with Dudley. Dudley himself had no <b>illusions</b> <b>about</b> his destroyed reputation, even when he first got notice of the jury's decision: [...] "God's will be done; and I wish he had made me the poorest that creepeth on the ground, so this mischance had not happened to me." [...] In September 1561, a month after the coroner's verdict was officially passed, the Earl of Arundel, one of Dudley's principal enemies, studied the testimonies in the hope of finding incriminating evidence against his rival.|$|E

500|$|I Corps assumed {{responsibility}} for the front in Cyrenaica on 15 February 1941, but within days Blamey was informed that his troops would be sent on the expedition to Greece. Blamey has been criticised for allowing this when {{he knew it was}} extremely hazardous, after he was told that Menzies had approved. He insisted, however, on sending the veteran 6th Division first instead of the 7th Division, resulting in a heated argument with Wavell, which Blamey won. He was under no <b>illusions</b> <b>about</b> the odds of success, and immediately prepared plans for an evacuation. His foresight and determination saved many of his men, but he lost credibility when he chose his son Tom to fill the one remaining seat on the aircraft carrying him out of Greece. The campaign exposed deficiencies in the Australian Army's training, leadership and staff work that had passed unnoticed or had not been addressed in the Libyan Campaign. The pressure of the campaign opened a rift between Blamey and Rowell, which was to have important consequences. While Rowell and Brigadier William Bridgeford were extremely critical of Blamey's performance in Greece, this opinion was not widely held. Wavell reported that [...] "Blamey has shown himself a fine fighting commander in these operations and fitted for high command." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} turned personal {{during the}} second of two debates between the two candidates when McConnell charged that the Iroquois Hunt Club, to which Beshear belonged, had no African-American members and was racially discriminatory. Beshear denied that the club was discriminatory and fired back that a prominent McConnell supporter from Louisville was [...] "virulently anti-women." [...] McConnell countered that Beshear had taken money from a labor union group that was under investigation for links to organized crime. After the debate, {{it was revealed that}} the Pendennis Club, of which McConnell had been a member, was under investigation for discriminatory membership practices; McConnell claimed he had resigned his membership in the club after perceiving that it practiced discrimination, but did not express his reasons for resigning to the club's membership or leadership. Ultimately, none of Beshear's arguments gained much traction, and he lost the race by a 724,794 votes (55.5%) to 560,012 (42.9%). At the time, it was the largest victory margin of McConnell's career. In a 2009 biography of McConnell, author John David Dyche wrote that Beshear [...] "had no <b>illusions</b> <b>about</b> his chance of success , but {{for the sake of his}} party, and hoping to ride the coattails of President Clinton's likely re-election, he got in the race."

500|$|The [...] "national legions" [...] were {{attached}} to the Waffen-SS, and fought on the Eastern Front in 1942 and early 1943. Unable to replace their losses, most of the survivors were incorporated into SS-Panzergrenadierdivision Nordland, authorised by Hitler {{at the end of}} 1942. The three regiments of the new division were formed using survivors of the Freikorps Danemark, Legion Niederlande and Legion Norwegen, supplemented by transfers from SS-Division Wiking, new recruits from the occupied West European countries, and Reich Germans. Legion Flandern was broken up and used as replacements in a number of Waffen-SS formations. While Weale states that they were mainly motivated by anti-communism, the historian George C. Stein observes that few of the [...] "national legion" [...] recruits were motivated by [...] "political or ideological idealism", but were instead motivated by such factors as a desire for adventure, better food, the prestige of the uniform, and personal circumstances. According to Stein, Berger had no <b>illusions</b> <b>about</b> the motives of his West European recruits, but paid mere lip service to the idea that they joined the [...] "anti-communist" [...] cause out of idealism. Around 25,000 Dutch, 5,000 Danish and 3,900 Norwegian men served in the Waffen-SS. However, by mid-1942 onwards, the Waffen-SS faced increasing difficulties with these [...] "Germanic" [...] recruits, especially due to the policy of integrating them into [...] "pan-Germanic" [...] formations such as SS-Division Wiking. For example, Norwegian recruits began requesting their release from duty, and at the beginning of 1943, nearly the entire Finnish battalion of that division asked to be released from their service obligations.|$|E
40|$|Hayek's epistemic {{arguments}} against planning were aimed not just against socialism {{but also the}} tradition of ecological economics. The concern with the physical preconditions of economic activity and defence of non-monetary measures in economic choice were expressions of the same rationalist <b>illusion</b> <b>about</b> the scope of human knowledge that underpinned the socialist project. Neurath's commitment to physicalism, in natura calculation and planning typified these errors. Neurath responded to these criticisms in unpublished notes and correspondence with Hayek. These highlighted the epistemological premises his work shared with Hayek's, representing a response to Hayek from Hayek's own assumptions. This paper examines the cogency and continuing relevance of the arguments in this debate. Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} practice in economic theory is {{to assume that}} all the relevant variables (e. g., the space of all the goods of potential economic value) and all the relevant constraints are known to the policymaker or to the designer of an economic system. This often unstated assumption (or the belief implictly embodied in it) inadvertently creates an <b>illusion</b> <b>about</b> our ability to design an economic system and control the process of resource allocation. In this paper, a series of examples is developed to illustrate that this modelling approach has the danger of misdirecting our attention when evaluating alternative forms of economic system. Some implications for reforms in the former socialist economies are also drawn. ...|$|R
