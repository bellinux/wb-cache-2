Lovett's stands on the nuclear weapons question and other major military issues generally followed those of his predecessors. He strongly supported universal military training, regarding it as the only viable long-term approach to building a reserve force, and thus making possible a smaller regular military establishment. A firm proponent of NATO, he played an important role when the NATO Council in February 1952 adopted <b>force</b> <b>goals</b> totaling 50 divisions and 4,000 aircraft to be achieved at the end of 1952.|$|E

40|$|A pseudo-inverse-Jacobian {{scheme to}} control {{deformations}} of a flexible load while attaining contact <b>force</b> <b>goals</b> with an external environment {{is discussed in}} this paper. The flexible load is manipulated by two arms. A kinematic description of the flexible load is obtained from a lumped-parameter model. Coordinated motion of the arms is achieved through kinematic redundancy resolution at the differential kinematic level. The strategy proposed here uses load flexibility to accommodate for position errors {{that would result in}} the build-up of internal forces in a rigid-load case.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} how a multi-limbed robot {{can carry}} out manipulation tasks involving simultaneous and compatible end-effector velocity and <b>force</b> <b>goals,</b> while also maintaining quasi-static stance stability. The formulation marries a local optimization process with an assumption of a compliant {{model of the}} environment. For purposes of illustration, we first develop the formulation for a single fixed based manipulator arm. Some of the basic kinematic variables we previously introduced for multi-limbed robot mechanism analysis in [1] are extended to accommodate this new formulation. Using these extensions, we provide a novel definition for static equilibrium of multi-limbed robot with actuator limits, and provide general conditions that guarantee the ability to apply arbitrary end-effector forces. Using these extended definitions, we present the local optimization problem and its solution for combined manipulation and stance. We also develop, using the theory of strong alternatives, a new definition and a computable test for quasi-static stance feasibility {{in the presence of}} manipulation forces. Simulations illustrate the concepts and method...|$|E

40|$|NTRODUCTION: Aging {{refers to}} normal, {{progressive}} and irreversible biological {{changes that occur}} over an individual’s life span. The advancement of medical science and increased awareness among the people has brought about {{a sharp decline in}} mortality and a steady decline in fertility. This has resulted in a worldwide shift in the demographic profile and has led to significant increase in the aged population. About two thirds of all older people are concentrated in the developing world. OBJECTIVES: to study & compare socio - demographic variables of old age people living in Urban & Urban slum areas. MATERIAL & METHODS: all the old age people living in urb a n slum area & rando mly selected one urban area of K arad town were interviewed by using pre structured proforma about socio - demographic variable & compared with each other. OBSERVATIONS: Total 153 from urban & 135 from urban slum were enrolled for the study. Nearly 2 / 3 rd subjects were above age 65 yrs in both areas with more female proportions in slum area than urban area. Significant difference was found with education, occupation & socio - economic status in both areas. CONCLUSION: Ageing is a universal phenomenon, with advanced fertility control, improvement in health and social services life expectancy has increased. Ageing has profound effect on the individual status in the family, the work <b>force,</b> <b>goals</b> and organization of health, social services, policies and practices of the governmen...|$|E
40|$|Community service {{projects}} have consistently been {{an effective means}} of community involvement and an avenue in which improvement in an area may be measured. Although the roles each participant assumes may differ, the ultimate accomplishment of the project is paramount to each person involved. This paper will explore the Governor 2 ̆ 7 s Task Force on Venereal Disease to determine both the effectiveness of the Task Force and the methods utilized to accomplish the task <b>force</b> <b>goals.</b> Primarily, this group of selected individuals will be reviewed to determine whether they were effective due to their ability to influence others, or simply through a great deal of hard work and co-operation. Data for this work was collected from individual written responses from Task Force participants, the Governor 2 ̆ 7 s Commission on Youth, various medical professionals, several works of other authors (see bibliography), data gathered by me as participant-observer, and through interviews from selected Task Force participants. Upon compiling the data, several concepts were revealed. I found that the influence that each participant enjoyed in the community was a primary factor of the effectiveness of the Task Force. Moreover, it was the influence of the particular individual with others who could assist with this particular problem which created a positive response, and thus effective results. This paper also explores the Task Force as a politically appointed group chosen to complete a specific project.
