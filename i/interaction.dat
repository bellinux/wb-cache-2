Goffman's other major works include Asylums (1961), Stigma (1963), <b>Interaction</b> Ritual (1967), Frame Analysis (1974), and Forms of Talk (1981). His major areas of study included the sociology of everyday life, social <b>interaction,</b> the social construction of self, social organization (framing) of experience, and particular elements of social life such as total institutions and stigmas.|$|E

The non-covalent <b>interactions</b> include ionic <b>interactions</b> and weak van der waals <b>interactions.</b> Ionic <b>interactions</b> form between an anion and a cation and form salt bridges that help stabilize the protein. Van der waals <b>interactions</b> include nonpolar <b>interactions</b> (i.e. London dispersion forces) and polar <b>interactions</b> (i.e. hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole bond).

5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{the weak}} <b>interaction</b> (the weak force or weak nuclear force) is {{the mechanism of}} <b>interaction</b> between sub-atomic particles that causes radioactive decay and thus plays {{an essential role in}} nuclear fission. The theory of the weak <b>interaction</b> is sometimes called quantum flavourdynamics (QFD), in analogy with the terms quantum chromodynamics (QCD) dealing with the strong <b>interaction</b> and quantum electrodynamics (QED) dealing with the electromagnetic force. However, the term QFD is rarely used because the weak force is best understood in terms of electro-weak theory (EWT).|$|E
5|$|Measurements of the <b>interaction</b> between {{energetic}} photons and hadrons {{show that}} the <b>interaction</b> is much more intense than expected by the <b>interaction</b> of merely photons with the hadron's electric charge. Furthermore, the <b>interaction</b> of energetic photons with protons {{is similar to the}} <b>interaction</b> of photons with neutrons {{in spite of the fact}} that the electric charge structures of protons and neutrons are substantially different. A theory called Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) was developed to explain this effect. According to VMD, the photon is a superposition of the pure electromagnetic photon which interacts only with electric charges and vector meson. However, if experimentally probed at very short distances, the intrinsic structure of the photon is recognized as a flux of quark and gluon components, quasi-free according to asymptotic freedom in QCD and described by the photon structure function. A comprehensive comparison of data with theoretical predictions was presented in a review in 2000.|$|E

50|$|Herb-drug <b>interactions</b> are drug <b>interactions</b> {{that occur}} between herbal {{medicines}} and conventional drugs. These types of <b>interactions</b> {{may be more}} common than drug-drug <b>interactions</b> because herbal medicines often contain multiple pharmacologically active ingredients, while conventional drugs typically contain only one. Some such <b>interactions</b> are clinically significant, although most herbal remedies are not associated with drug <b>interactions</b> causing serious consequences. Most herb-drug <b>interactions</b> are moderate in severity. The most commonly implicated conventional drugs in herb-drug <b>interactions</b> are warfarin, insulin, aspirin, digoxin, and ticlopidine, due to their narrow therapeutic indices.
