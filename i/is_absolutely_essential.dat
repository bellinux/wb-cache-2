500|$|In January or February 1943, Chevalier {{had a brief}} {{conversation}} with Oppenheimer {{in the kitchen of}} his home. Chevalier told Oppenheimer that there was a scientist, George Eltenton, who could transmit information of a technical nature to the Soviet Union. Oppenheimer rejected the overture, but failed to report it until August 1943, when he volunteered to Manhattan Project security officers that three men at Berkeley had been solicited for nuclear secrets on behalf of the Soviet Union, by a person he did not know who worked for Shell Oil, and who had Communist connections. He gave that person's name as George Eltenton. When pressed on the issue in later interviews at Los Alamos in December 1943 with Groves, who promised to keep the identity of the three men from the FBI, Oppenheimer identified the contact who had approached him as Chevalier, and told Groves that only one person had been approached: his brother Frank. Groves considered Oppenheimer too important to the ultimate Allied goals of building atomic bombs and winning the war to oust him over this suspicious behavior. He ordered that Oppenheimer be given a security clearance [...] "without delay, irrespective of the information which you have concerning Mr. Oppenheimer. He <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>essential</b> to the project." ...|$|E

Indeed, as Justice Brennan observes, the United States played an instrumental role in the criminal prosecution of Nazi officials who experimented with human subjects during the Second World War, and the standards that the Nuremberg Military Tribunals developed to judge {{the behavior of the}} defendants stated that the 'voluntary consent of the human subject <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>essential</b> ... to satisfy moral, ethical, and legal concepts.'

The presence of an excellent quality Upper Jurassic source rock in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin was first identified in well cuttings from the Egret K-36 exploration well. [...] This Kimmeridgian package of organic-rich, thinly interbedded and finely laminated marlstones and calcareous shales was formally defined as the Egret Member of the Rankin Formation. [...] These economically important beds have been demonstrated to be present across the Jeanne d'Arc Basin. [...] Microscopic analyses identified abundant bituminous/liptinitic detrital material and a lack of terrestrial organic matter. [...] These characteristics indicate that the Egret Member is dominated by marine-derived Type II organic matter deposited under reducing conditions. [...] Hydrocarbons trapped throughout the Jeanne d'Arc Basin were mainly sourced from the prolific Egret Member.|$|E

2500|$|Preseason {{speculation}} ran high {{about what}} would happen with the Buccaneers’ first overall choice in the draft, with Houston Oilers’ coach Bum Phillips reportedly stating that the Oilers would better any other team's offer to the Buccaneers. Unlike the previous year, when it was made clear early on that Ricky Bell was to be their choice, the Buccaneers kept quiet about who they might draft, further fueling speculation about a trade. The New York Jets were said to have offered their fourth-overall draft pick, plus any player on their roster other than Richard Todd. Tight end was considered to be the Buccaneers’ single greatest need, with Ken MacAfee of Notre Dame often mentioned as a likely draft target. According to Don Shula, [...] "With John McKay's type of offense, an outstanding tight end <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>essential.</b> It cannot go without one". This happened {{to be one of the}} positions hit hardest by injury in 1977. With most of their mid-round draft picks traded away, the Buccaneers were looking for a trade that would bring them several draft picks. With no teams willing to give up a starting quarterback as part of a deal, the Buccaneers eventually traded the pick to the Oilers, for tight end Jimmie Giles and the Oilers’ first- and second-round picks in 1978, and their third- and fifth-round picks in 1979. Needing a fullback, the Buccaneers shortly afterward traded Anthony Davis to the Oilers for Don Hardeman.|$|E
