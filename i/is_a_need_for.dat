5|$|Just {{as there}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> tax shifting, {{there is also}} a need for subsidy shifting. Subsidies are not an {{inherently}} bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes. The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30years, only one of the 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded. In terms of specific examples, the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes. And the combination of the federal tax deduction and a robust state tax deduction in California helped to create the modern wind power industry.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{added that}} there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the {{decision-maker}} {{to adduce evidence}} in court to prove that considerations of national security are involved. A mere assertion by the decision-maker that a matter involves national security does not preclude the court's judicial function of determining whether the decision was in fact based on grounds of national security. In other words, national security cannot be raised as a plea in bar to prevent the court from considering an application at all. However, what the court cannot do is decide what action national security requires. This is to be left solely to those responsible for it.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} requested, for {{an investigation}} into the hemodynamic changes in a patient with chronic venous insufficiency, which results in chronic venous disease, is quite different from an examination request made for suspected deep vein thrombosis. For a DVT investigation there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> guidance as to what to look for and to the intended treatment. An investigation performed with the intention of treating the patient by vein stripping or laser therapy for example {{is very different from the}} examination performed with the intention of executing a CHIVA. This French originated procedure is also spelt out as conservative hemodynamic treatment for chronic venous insufficiency. A CHIVA is an ultrasound guided, minimally invasive surgery strategic for the treatment of varicose veins, performed under local anaesthetic.|$|E

25|$|There are {{at least}} 730 {{identified}} species of insects in the park. The maximum number of species belong to the orders Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. Many unclassified species have been collected and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> further studies.|$|E

25|$|RC {{considers}} that co-counseling {{does not imply}} psychopathology {{on the part of}} co-counselors or the need for professional treatment and that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> lay counselors because of the shortage of professionals.

25|$|The {{interim report}} {{highlighted}} {{a number of}} core issues: that speech, language and communication are not only essential life skills but fundamental human rights; that early identification of problems and intervention is important to avoid social problems later on; and that {{the current system of}} treatment is patchy, i.e. there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> services to be continually provided for children and families from an early age.|$|E

25|$|The Court also {{observed}} that the law on contempt of court operated against the broader legal canvas {{of the right to}} freedom of speech that is embodied within Article 14 of the Constitution as well as the common law.
