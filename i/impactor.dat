5|$|Impact phase began {{nominally}} on June 29, 2005, {{five days}} before impact. The <b>impactor</b> successfully separated from the flyby spacecraft at 6:00 (6:07 Ground UTC) July 3 UTC. The first images from the instrumented <b>Impactor</b> were seen two hours after separation.|$|E
5|$|The flyby {{spacecraft}} performed {{one of two}} divert maneuvers {{to avoid}} damage. A 14-minute burn was executed which slowed down the spacecraft. It was also reported that the communication link between the flyby and the <b>impactor</b> was functioning as expected. The <b>impactor</b> spacecraft executed three correction maneuvers {{in the final two}} hours before impact.|$|E
5|$|More ambitious {{ideas have}} been put forward {{including}} an <b>impactor</b> in combination with a thermal drill to search for biosignatures that might be frozen in the shallow subsurface.|$|E
50|$|Similar to {{single-stage}} <b>impactors</b> in collection methods, cascade <b>impactors</b> {{have multiple}} size cuts (PM10, PM2.5), allowing for bioaerosols to separate according to size. Separating biological material by aerodynamic diameter is useful due to size ranges being dominated by {{specific types of}} organisms (bacteria exist range from 1-20 micrometers and pollen from 10-100 micrometers). The Andersen line of cascade <b>impactors</b> are most widely used to test air particles.|$|R

Ballistic {{performance of}} two three-dimensional conical <b>impactors</b> or thin <b>impactors</b> {{with the same}} longitudinal contours manufactured from the same material and having the same lengths of nose and cylindrical part is compared.

40|$|Composite liners {{have been}} {{fabricated}} for the Los Alamos liner driven HEDP experiments using <b>impactors</b> formed by {{physical vapor deposition}} (PVD), electroplating, machining and shrink fitting. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been proposed for some ATLAS liner applications. This paper describes the processes used to fabricate machined and shrink fitted <b>impactors</b> which {{have been used for}} copper <b>impactors</b> in 1100 aluminum liners and 6061 T- 6 aluminum <b>impactors</b> in 1100 aluminum liners. The most successful processes have been largely empirically developed and rely upon a combination of shrink fitted and light press fitting. The processes used to date will be described along with some considerations for future composite liners requirements in the HEDP Program...|$|R
5|$|Deep Impact was a NASA {{space probe}} {{launched}} from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 18:47 UTC on January 12, 2005. It {{was designed to}} study the interior composition of the comet Tempel 1 (9P/Tempel), by releasing an <b>impactor</b> into the comet. At 05:52 UTC on July 4, 2005, the <b>impactor</b> successfully collided with the comet's nucleus. The impact excavated debris from {{the interior of the}} nucleus, forming an impact crater. Photographs taken by the spacecraft showed the comet to be more dusty and less icy than had been expected. The impact generated an unexpectedly large and bright dust cloud, obscuring the view of the impact crater.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{hypothesis}} was put forth that argued the <b>impactor</b> {{that killed the}} dinosaurs belonged to the Baptistina family of asteroids. Concerns have been raised regarding the reputed link, in part because very few solid observational constraints exist of the asteroid or family. Indeed, it was recently discovered that 298 Baptistina does not share the same chemical signature {{as the source of}} the K–Pg impact. Although this finding may make the link between the Baptistina family and K–Pg <b>impactor</b> more difficult to substantiate, it does not preclude the possibility. A 2011 Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, (WISE), study of reflected light from the asteroids of the family estimated the break-up at 80Ma, giving it insufficient time to shift orbits and impact the Earth by 66Ma.|$|E
5|$|According {{to genetic}} studies, the {{families}} Hyloidea, Microhylidae, and the clade Natatanura (comprising about 88% of living frogs) diversified simultaneously some 66 million years ago, {{soon after the}} Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event associated with the Chicxulub <b>impactor.</b> All origins of arboreality (e.g. in Hyloidea and Natatanura) follow from that time and the resurgence of forest that occurred afterwards.|$|E
40|$|Evidence on meteors and bolides {{shows that}} {{fragmentation}} {{is a major}} ablation process for all <b>impactors</b> penetrating the Earth's atmosphere, surpassing evaporation and fusion for <b>impactors</b> of the 'soft' cometary type. This model and data from plumes detected by the Hubble Space Telescope were used to estimate {{the size of the}} Shoemaker-Levy 9 nucleus...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to provide data for the design of multi-nozzle <b>impactors</b> giving size-fractionated samples for X-ray emission analysis and for size-distribution determinations of the α-particle activity from aerosol-particle-attached radon progenies. Different multi-nozzle <b>impactors</b> with laser-drilled 50 – 60 μm diameter nozzles designed for a cut-off diameter of about 0. 05 μm were experimentally characterised. The nozzles were placed in a spiral pattern within a circle of 8. 0 mm diameter. The nozzle-plate porosities were 0. 013 and 0. 050 (porosity = total cross-sectional area of nozzles divided by nozzle-plate area). The results show that laser-drilled nozzles can be used for multi-nozzle <b>impactors</b> and that the maximum nozzle-plate porosity is limited by the cross flow. The collection characteristics of the multi-nozzle <b>impactors</b> studied here were found to be more dependent on the Reynolds number and the S/W ratio [the ratio of the distance (S) between nozzle plate and impaction plate to the nozzle diameter (W) ], than what has been shown for single-nozzle <b>impactors.</b> The S/W ratio and the Reynolds number must be considered if high size resolution is to be achieved...|$|R

5|$|Jovian Europa Orbiter was an ESA Cosmic Vision concept {{study from}} 2007. Another concept was Ice Clipper, {{which would have}} used an <b>impactor</b> similar to the Deep Impact mission—it would make a {{controlled}} crash into the surface of Europa, generating a plume of debris that would then be collected by a small spacecraft flying through the plume.|$|E
5|$|The <b>impactor</b> {{returned}} {{images as}} late as three seconds before impact. Most of the data captured was stored on board the flyby spacecraft, which radioed approximately 4,500 images from the HRI, MRI, and ITS cameras to Earth {{over the next few}} days. The energy from the collision was similar in size to exploding five tons of dynamite and the comet shone six times brighter than normal.|$|E
5|$|The <b>impactor</b> was maneuvered {{to plant}} itself {{in front of}} the comet, so that Tempel 1 would collide with it. Impact {{occurred}} at 05:45 UTC (05:52 Ground UTC, +/- up to three minutes, one-way light time = 7m 26s) on the morning of July 4, 2005, within one second of the expected time for impact.|$|E

5|$|A comet-impact {{mission was}} first {{proposed}} to NASA in 1996, {{but at the}} time, NASA engineers were skeptical that the target could be hit. In 1999, a revised and technologically upgraded mission proposal, dubbed Deep Impact, was accepted and funded as part of NASA's Discovery Program of low-cost spacecraft. The two spacecraft (<b>Impactor</b> and Flyby) and the three main instruments were built and integrated by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. in Boulder, Colorado. Developing the software for the spacecraft took 18 months and the application code consisted of 20,000 lines and 19 different application threads. The total cost of developing the spacecraft and completing its mission reached US$330million.|$|E
5|$|Taken together, {{analyses}} {{indicate that}} the <b>impactor</b> was large enough to create a 120-mile peak ring, to melt, shock and eject granite from many miles within the earth, to create colossal water movements, and to eject an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into the atmosphere, where they would have persisted over years to decades. This global dispersal of dust and sulfates would {{have led to a}} sudden and catastrophic effect on the climate worldwide, large temperature drops, and devastated the food chain. The researchers stated that the impact generated an environmental calamity that extinguished life, but it also induced a vast subsurface hydrothermal system that became an oasis for the recovery of life.|$|E
5|$|Giant impacts {{are thought}} to have been common in the early Solar System. Computer {{simulations}} of a giant impact have produced results that are consistent with the mass of the lunar core and the present angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system. These simulations also show that most of the Moon derived from the <b>impactor,</b> rather than the proto-Earth. More recent simulations suggest a larger fraction of the Moon derived from the original Earth mass. Studies of meteorites originating from inner Solar System bodies such as Mars and Vesta show that they have very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions as compared to Earth, whereas Earth and the Moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions. The isotopic equalization of the Earth-Moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two, although this is debated.|$|E

5|$|The main {{evidence}} of such an impact, besides the crater itself, is contained in {{a thin layer of}} clay present in the K–Pg boundary across the world. In the late 1970s, the Alvarezes and colleagues reported that it contained an abnormally high concentration of iridium. Iridium levels in this layer reached 6 parts per billion by weight or more compared to 0.4 for the Earth's crust as a whole; in comparison, meteorites can contain around 470 parts per billion of this element. It was hypothesized that the iridium was spread into the atmosphere when the <b>impactor</b> was vaporized and settled across the Earth's surface amongst other material thrown up by the impact, producing the layer of iridium-enriched clay. Similarly, an iridium anomaly in core samples from the Pacific Ocean suggested the Eltanin impact of about 2.5 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Two {{regions of}} smooth plains were {{observed}} by Voyager 2. They generally have low relief and have far fewer craters {{than in the}} cratered terrains, indicating a relatively young surface age. In one of the smooth plain regions, Sarandib Planitia, no impact craters were visible down to the limit of resolution. Another region of smooth plains to the southwest of Sarandib is criss-crossed by several troughs and scarps. Cassini has since viewed these smooth plains regions, like Sarandib Planitia and Diyar Planitia at much higher resolution. Cassini images show these regions filled with low-relief ridges and fractures, probably caused by shear deformation. The high-resolution images of Sarandib Planitia revealed {{a number of small}} impact craters, which allow for an estimate of the surface age, either 170 million years or 3.7 billion years, depending on assumed <b>impactor</b> population.|$|E

40|$|Foreign Object Damage (FOD) as {{described}} in the previous chapters {{is one of the most}} difficult problems facing designers and maintainers of modern gas turbine engines. The primary reason for the difficulty is the uncertainty associated with FOD. First, there are a wide variety of hard-body FOD sources, ranging from very small <b>impactors</b> such as sand and small rocks, up to large <b>impactors</b> such as tools and bolts...|$|R
40|$|Mars {{appears to}} be {{deficient}} in large craters relative to Mercury and the Moon. This relative deficiency conflicts with the interpretation of a common population of <b>impactors</b> within the early inner solar system and suggest either of two possibilities. If the apparent deficiency of martian craters is real then the population of <b>impactors</b> at Mars differed significantly from that closer to the Sun. If the apparent deficiency is not real then the complete crater inventory of Mars should be {{similar to those of}} Mercury and the Moon, supporting the interpretation of a single population of <b>impactors.</b> These alternate possibilities can be tested by comparing revised inventories that include partly buried or eroded craters to an estimate of Mars' possible relative crater deficiency...|$|R

25|$|Geologically Lofn {{is divided}} {{into a number of}} zones {{including}} the flat central floor zone, ring of massifs around it and the outer rings of bright and dark impact ejecta. Lofn was probably formed by an oblique <b>impactor</b> coming from the north-west. The relative shallowness of it is explained by either fragmentation of the <b>impactor</b> prior to the contact with the surface or by the post impact relaxation of Callisto's ductile crust.|$|E
25|$|Due to the site's {{location}} {{beneath the}} Antarctic ice sheet {{there are no}} direct samples to test for evidence of impact. There are alternative explanations for this mass concentration, such as formation by a mantle plume or other large-scale volcanic activity. If this feature really is an impact crater then, based {{on the size of}} the ring structure, it has been suggested by Frese's team that the <b>impactor</b> could have been four or five times wider than the Chicxulub <b>impactor,</b> which is believed to have caused the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.|$|E
25|$|The {{significant}} asymmetry in {{distribution of}} the impact ejecta indicates that Lofn was formed by an oblique impact. The <b>impactor</b> probably came from the north-west. The shallowness of the crater {{may be related to}} the fragmentation of the <b>impactor</b> prior to the contact with the surface. A cluster of fragments is generally less efficient in excavation of the surface material than a single body. Another reason for the flat floor of Lofn is viscous relaxation of the crust after impact, which implies the existence of a layer of ductile material below the surface at the time of the impact. This soft material may be warm ice or even a subsurface ocean.|$|E

40|$|Beginning in 1974, {{a limited}} effort to collect {{extraterrestrial}} dust {{samples from the}} stratosphere using <b>impactors</b> mounted on NASA U- 2 aircraft was initiated at NASA Ames Research Center (1). Subsequent studies (e. g. 1 - 9) have clearly established an extraterrestrial origin {{for some of the}} material. Attrition of comets is considered {{to be one of the}} potential sources of extraterrestrial dust(1, 5). Additionally, some of the particles appear to represent a type of primitive material not represented in meteorite collections. In order to provide a greater availability of these samples to the scientific community, NASA-Johnson Space Center (JSC) began in May of 1981 a program dedicated to the systematic collection and curation of cosmic dust for scientific investigation. Collections were made at 18 to 20 km altitude by means of collectors mounted under the wings of a WB 57 F. When the aircraft reaches operating altitude, the collector plates (<b>impactors)</b> are extended into the ambient airstream with the collection surface normal to the airflow. To prevent particles from bouncing off the surface, the <b>impactors</b> are coated with a film of high viscosity silicone oil. The <b>impactors</b> are sealed in canisters to minimize contamination when not collecting...|$|R
