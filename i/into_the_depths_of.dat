The COG deploy several units into the Locust Tunnels, known as 'The Hollow', despite {{sustaining}} heavy casualties.

5|$|The game {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} about a seaside town which was damaged by a cataclysm and consequently sunk <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> the earth. A town named Rogueport was later built at this site, with {{the fortunes of}} the lost kingdom fabled to exist behind the eponymous Thousand-Year Door, located in the ruins of the old town. Mario becomes involved when Princess Peach contacts him about a treasure map that she bought in Rogueport, but becomes part of a larger adventure after learning that Peach has gone missing. With the help of Goombella and Professor Frankly, Mario learns that the map can potentially reveal the location of the 7 legendary Crystal Stars, which are required to unlock the Thousand-Year Door. Under the assumption that Peach herself is trying to find the Crystal Stars, he uses the map in an attempt to locate her.|$|E

On his way, Zack allies with Angeal, who has developed doubts about his and Genesis' actions. As Angeal, Zack and Sephiroth protect the headquarters, Angeal confronts Genesis, but both disappear. Zack is subsequently ordered to investigate Modeoheim, where Genesis has been spotted. En route, Zack meets Shinra infantryman Cloud, and they become friends.

5|$|Rodimus, {{being given}} {{half of the}} Matrix, decides to lead {{a search for the}} fabled Knights of Cybertron in the hope that they can help restore order to Cybertron. Taking to the stars on board the ship called the Lost Light, Rodimus is joined by Ultra Magnus and Drift as his second-and-third-in-commands, Ratchet, Chromedome, Rewind, Swerve, Brainstorm, Rung, Whirl and a {{reformed}} Cyclonus, among several others. Following an unexpected quantum jump upon launch, the Lost Light is hurled off <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> space, where the crew is joined by Skids and contends with a stowaway Sparkeater. A visit to Delphi by Ratchet to help cure a plague introduces the threat of the Decepticon Justice Division, who then feature in a Decepticon-dedicated story menacing a band of misfit Decepticons, and also brings the facility's surviving patients and staff onto the ship—including Fortress Maximus, whose post-traumatic stress causes him to snap and nearly kill Rung. Hoping to cure Rung's damaged brain, Rewind gathers a small group together to recount a shared story from their past about Orion Pax foiling a Senate plot to discredit the burgeoning Decepticon movement in the days of Functionism. Chromedome is manipulated by Drift into carrying out a plan laid out by Prowl: using his mnemosurgery skills to tap the memories and learn the secrets of mass-murdering Decepticon Overlord, secretly hidden on board the Lost Light. Unfortunately, Chromedome accidentally allows Overlord to escape, and Rewind has to sacrifice himself to jettison the monster from the ship before the section of the ship is blown up. Drift admits to responsibility for Overlord's actions, resulting in his exile, even though Rodimus later reveals he {{was a part of the}} plot as well. Ultra Magnus is also fatally wounded in the battle, but when his body disappears from the ship's Medibay, the crew track it to Luna 1, where they discover and foil a twisted plot by Chief Justice Tyrest to wipe out all those Transformers he sees as tainted by original sin.|$|E

25|$|One of the Frances most {{distinguishable}} {{features were}} her funnels, designed {{not only to}} be eye-catching but functional as well. They were constructed with two wings on the sides, each to lead the exhaust fumes outwards into the ship's slipstream, {{where they would be}} caught by the wind and carried away from the passenger decks below. In addition, each stack had a device that filtered solids from the outlet, returned it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> the ship and then disposed of it into the ocean.|$|E

25|$|Even more {{distinctive}} is a mermaid like figure {{called a}} Tlanchana.

This idea comes from a time when the Metepec area was filled with shallow lakes and marshes. In the main plaza of Metepec, there is a large Tlanchana fountain, created from local clay.|$|E

25|$|The Aboriginal {{name for}} the area is Arkaroo, {{the name of a}} legendary great snake. Arkaroo is reputed to have drank up all the water in Lake Frome, but, upset by its saltiness, he wriggled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> the ranges, where his upset stomach {{continues}} to rumble to this day. The booming noises which are heard in the ranges today are thought to either be wind whistling through the narrow gorges or (more probably) large rockfalls. Arkaroo is the origin of the placename Arkaroola, used in several contexts in the area (also as the name of a station south of Wilpena).|$|E
25|$|One of Vampires {{most celebrated}} {{sequences}} involves the astronauts performing {{an exploration of}} an alien, derelict ship discovered in a huge ruin {{on the surface of}} the planet. The crewmembers climb up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> the eerie ship and discover the gigantic remains of long dead monstrous creatures. In 1979, Cinefantastique noted the remarkable similarities between this atmospheric sequence and a lengthy scene in the then-new Alien. The magazine also pointed out other minor parallels between the two films. However, both Aliens director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Dan O'Bannon claimed at the time that they had never seen Planet of the Vampires.|$|E

25|$|In 1581 Yermak {{began his}} voyage <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> Siberia {{with a band}} of 1,636 men, {{following}} the Tagil and Tura Rivers. The following year {{they were on the}} Tobol, and 500 men successfully laid siege to Qashliq, the residence of Khan Kuchum, near what is now Tobolsk. After a few victories over the khan's army, Yermak's people defeated the main forces of Kuchum on Irtysh River after a 3-day battle of Chuvash Cape in 1582. The remains of the khan's army retreated to the steppes, abandoning his domains to Yermak, who, according to tradition, by presenting Siberia to tsar Ivan IV achieved his own restoration to favour.|$|E
25|$|Around 1577, Semyon Stroganov {{and other}} sons of Anikey Stroganov hired a Cossack leader called Yermak {{to protect their}} lands from the attacks of Siberian Khan Kuchum.

In 1581 Yermak began his voyage <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> Siberia. After a few victories over the khan's army, Yermak's people defeated the main forces of Kuchum on Irtysh River in a 3-day Battle of Chuvash Cape in 1582. The remains of the khan's army retreated to the steppes, and thus Yermak captured the Siberia Khanate, including its capital Qashliq near modern Tobolsk. Kuchum still was strong and suddenly attacked Yermak in 1585 in the dead of night, killing most of his people. Yermak was wounded and tried to swim across the Wagay River (Irtysh's tributary), but drowned under the weight of his own chain mail. The Cossacks had to withdraw from Siberia completely, but thanks to Yermak's having explored all the main river routes in West Siberia, Russians successfully reclaimed all his conquests just several years later.|$|E

25|$|Terra is {{the first}} {{introduced}} character, a mentally-enslaved Imperial super-soldier gifted with devastating magic. She is tasked to the Magitek-armored assault on Narshe, slaughtering most of the town's militia {{in pursuit of a}} recently unearthed frozen Esper. Upon encountering the creature, her Imperial contingent is annihilated together with her armor. She wakes in Arvis' home, freed of her slave crown and suffering amnesia. Pursued <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> Narshe's mines by local forces, she is eventually rescued by Locke (a member of the Returners) and a horde of moogles. After experiencing events in the Figaro kingdom and after another Imperial assault on Narshe to claim the Esper, she eventually learns that she is the daughter of an Esper father and human mother, explaining her natural magical abilities. Brain-washed, extensively trained and manipulated, she had been instrumental in the Empire's subjugation of the other city-states on the southern continent, her powers even decimating fifty Imperial troops in moments. Instrumental in the Returner's strategy to ally with the Espers beyond the sealed gate, Terra succeeds in opening the barrier between worlds and unintentionally unleashes the Espers' devastating obliteration of the Empire.|$|E

The sludgy riffs, which were pure [...] Sabbath, are offset by some of King's and Hanneman's faster solos, giving Slayer entrée into the speed metal realm." ...|$|E
