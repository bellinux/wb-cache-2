40|$|In this study, the {{participation}} of employee architects <b>in</b> decision <b>making</b> <b>in</b> architectural firms is investigated. This is {{with a view to}} identifying the organisational contexts that enhance employee participation <b>in</b> decision <b>making.</b> The impact of such participation on the performances of the firms was also assessed. This study was carried out through a questionnaire survey of employers of architects in Nigeria. In agreement with findings of previous studies, participation of the employees of the architectural firms in the study <b>in</b> decision <b>making</b> is low. Employee participation <b>in</b> decision <b>making</b> <b>in</b> the firms was dependent on the staffing strategy and proportion of junior staff in many cases. The positive impact of employee participation <b>in</b> decision <b>making</b> on firm performance varied with the nature of the decision. This study concludes that there is need for employers in architectural firms to identify the categories of decision that employees should be involved in and to modify their firm contexts to encourage participation where desired...|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the influence of teacher’s participation <b>in</b> Decision <b>Making</b> on their job performances in public secondary schools in Kilombero district. The study identified job performance of teachers in secondary schools. Four research questions and objectives were formulated. Data for the study were collected by using interviews, questionnaires and documentation. The study revealed that teachers in public secondary schools participate less <b>in</b> decision <b>making.</b> <b>In</b> public secondary schools, the Ministry of Educations influences most of the decisions. The study also revealed that participation <b>in</b> decision <b>making</b> can influence performance as teachers who participate <b>in</b> decision <b>making</b> tend to perform better {{than those who do}} not participate or participate less <b>in</b> decision <b>making</b> <b>in</b> secondary school. It is also recommended that turnover can be reduced when teachers participate <b>in</b> decision <b>making</b> and it helps teachers to be motivated and self-commitment to work. It is therefore recommended by the researcher that staff should be encouraged to have a say in school governance. The Ministry of Education should device a means to encourage staff in public secondary schools to participate in decisions that affect the school and their performance...|$|R

5|$|Even if a {{differentiating}} {{measure is}} found, {{there is a}} strong presumption that it is constitutional. The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification <b>in</b> <b>making</b> laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy. Unless the law is plainly arbitrary, suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality. It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people, and is experienced <b>in</b> <b>making</b> laws directed at societal problems, hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds. Therefore, to rebut this presumption it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to show that it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily.|$|E
