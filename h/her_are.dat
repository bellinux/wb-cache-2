5|$|Since 1994, Brant {{has been}} honored as a Person of National Historic Significance in Canada. She was long ignored or disparaged by historians of the United States, but {{scholarly}} {{interest in her}} increased in the late 20th century. She has sometimes been controversial, criticized for being pro-British {{at the expense of}} the Iroquois. But the Iroquois primarily allied with the British. Known to have been a devout Anglican, she is commemorated on April 16 in the calendar of the Anglican Church of Canada and the Episcopal Church (USA). No portraits of <b>her</b> <b>are</b> known to exist; an idealized likeness is featured on a statue in Kingston and on a Canadian stamp issued in 1986.|$|E
5|$|The group {{assumes that}} {{completing}} this task {{will result in}} the granting of their wishes. The Wicked Witch of the West (Miss Piggy) sees them coming and consults with her pet Foo-Foo and her henchman Johnny Fiama. When the Wicked Witch of the West plans to have either her pack of 40 great man-eating wolves, a flock of 40 crows of despair, a swarm of angry black bees, a group of vicious squirrels, or a group of bloodthirsty cockatoos to do away with them, Johnny tells her that the animals that work for <b>her</b> <b>are</b> unavailable due to various reasons. This forces her to resort to using her Magic Biker Cap to call Sal Minella and the other Flying Monkeys (played by Sweetums, Crazy Harry, Black Dog, Calico, Old Tom, Spotted Dick, and Aretha from Fraggle Rock) to deal with them. The Witch and the Flying Monkeys capture Dorothy and Lion while Scarecrow and Tin Thing are dismantled by the Flying Monkeys.|$|E
5|$|Darius {{was the son}} of Hystaspes and the {{grandson}} of Arsames. Both men belonged to the Achaemenid tribe and were still alive when Darius ascended the throne. Darius justifies his ascension to the throne with his lineage. He claimed he could trace his ancestors back to Achaemenes, even though he was only distantly related. With this in mind, Darius married Atossa, daughter of Cyrus, with whom he had four sons: Xerxes, Achaemenes, Masistes and Hystaspes. He also married Artystone, another daughter of Cyrus, with whom he had two sons, Arsames and Gobryas. Darius married Parmys, the daughter of Bardiya, with whom he had a son, Ariomardus. Furthermore, Darius married Phratagune, with whom he had two sons, Abrokomas and Hyperantes. He also married another woman of the nobility, Phaidyme, the daughter of Otanes. It is unknown if he had any children with her. Before these royal marriages, Darius had married an unknown daughter of his good friend and lance carrier Gobryas from an early marriage, with whom he had three sons, Artobazanes, Ariabignes and Arsamenes. Any daughters he had with <b>her</b> <b>are</b> not known. Although Artobazanes was Darius's first-born, Xerxes became heir and the next king through the influence of Atossa; she had great authority in the kingdom as Darius loved her the most of all his wives.|$|E
60|$|She {{waited at}} the {{terminus}} for the tram. Here it <b>was</b> beginning. Before <b>her</b> <b>was</b> the station to Nottingham, whence Theresa had gone to school half an hour before; behind <b>her</b> <b>was</b> the little church school she had attended {{when she was a}} child, when <b>her</b> grandmother <b>was</b> alive. <b>Her</b> grandmother had <b>been</b> dead two years now. There was a strange woman at the Marsh, with her Uncle Fred, and a small baby. Behind <b>her</b> <b>was</b> Cossethay, and blackberries were ripe on the hedges.|$|R

5|$|Krøyer's {{paintings}} of Marie between 1888 and 1906 present {{a record of}} the years they spent together. They show some of their most enjoyable times but also hint at the marital tension that increased as time went by. Among the most notable {{paintings of}} <b>her</b> <b>are</b> Summer Evening at Skagen. The Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore (1892), one of Denmark's most popular works, which shows Marie on the beach with their dog and with the moonlight reflected in the sea, Roses (1893), which depicts her relaxing in the garden, and Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – The Artist and his Wife (1899). Also of note are the depictions of Marie on holiday in Ravello on the Amalfi Coast of Italy in 1890; the portrait for the frieze in the dining room at Skagen's Brøndums Hotel; Chez Moi, a series of watercolours of Marie and the couple's daughter Vibeke in the family homes in Copenhagen and Skagen; and Midsummer Eve Bonfire on Skagen Beach, his last painting of her in which she is shown captured in the firelight with Alfvén.|$|E
5|$|The more {{positive}} emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24-month-old toddler displays when coping with separation from a parent, the better s/he is 3.5 years later at using cooling strategies {{in order to}} delay gratification. This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required for coping with social and interpersonal frustrations {{are similar to those}} utilized for coping with the aggravation of goal-directed delay of gratification. Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child's ability to delay gratification. An interaction has been found between a mother's level of control and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment. Children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from <b>her</b> <b>are</b> able to employ more cooling strategies and delay rewards longer. Similarly, children who stay close to a non-controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays. This suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli, although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown. A greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self-regulation when the child was a toddler, indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of self-regulation, self-control and emotional competency.|$|E
5|$|The {{third season}} follows Michael inside Sona and Lincoln {{on the outside}} in Panama. Sona is a prison that has been run by the inmates and guarded only from the outside due to a riot the year before. Burrows is quickly {{contacted}} by Gretchen Morgan (a Company operative {{who was in charge}} of operations in Panama) who kidnapped his son LJ and Sara, the woman Michael loves. He is told that The Company wants Scofield to break James Whistler out of Sona. The season follows Michael and Whistler's trials in formulating an escape plan, as Michael has to deal with extreme tension and as Lincoln deals with The Company's operative Gretchen Morgan. Sucre gets a job at the prison to aid Michael in his escape plan. When Lincoln attempts to rescue Sara and LJ following a clue provided by Sara, Gretchen claims to have beheaded Sara and sends Lincoln a head in a box as a warning. As the season ends, the pair manage to escape along with Mahone, and another inmate, Luis, leaving behind several accomplices including T-Bag and Bellick. Sucre's identity is discovered by a prison guard and he is thrown into Sona just after the escape. LJ and Sofia (who was captured for a guarantee that Whistler would go with <b>her)</b> <b>are</b> traded for Whistler, and Michael seeks revenge against Gretchen for Sara's death.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kesha waking {{up next to}} her love interest; she then {{proceeds}} to run away while being chased by the man. Kesha walks through the desert while split scenes of <b>her</b> <b>are</b> shown where she is riding an elephant and wearing a tiger mask while crawling around in the sand. They are later seen on a boat singing and pretending to row while digitally animated water is added. It then cuts to a scene of all animation in which Kesha is portrayed as a mermaid. The mermaid and the man share a kiss; the video then jumps to a scene on a rocky hillside with Kesha walking around the sand with the man standing above on a rock. The video then cuts to another scene where Kesha is covered in glow in the dark body paint while dancing around in a cave with a python around her neck. The video ends with Kesha and her lover sitting around a campfire while still in the desert.|$|E

25|$|Bona Dea's cults in {{the city}} of Rome were led by the Vestal Virgins, and her provincial cults by virgin or matron priestesses.

Approximately one third of her dedications are from men, some of whom may have been lawfully involved in her cult.|$|E
25|$|Hanafi: The Hanafi {{school does}} not {{consider}} a woman's face to be awrah; however it is still obligatory (wajib) {{for a woman to}} cover her face. While the Hanafi school has not completely forbidden a male's gaze towards a female's face when there exists absolutely no fear of attraction, the woman has no way of knowing whether the gazes directed towards <b>her</b> <b>are</b> free of desire or not, especially when she is out in public. The Hanafi school has thus obliged women to cover their faces in front of strangers.|$|E
25|$|His {{two most}} {{important}} post-war works are Sembazuru (Thousand Cranes) from 1949 to 1951, and Yama no Oto (The Sound of the Mountain), 1949–1954. Sembazuru is centered on the tea ceremony and hopeless love. The protagonist is attracted to the mistress of his dead father and, after her death, to her daughter, who flees from him. The tea ceremony provides a beautiful background for ugly human affairs, but Kawabata’s intent is rather to explore feelings about death. The tea ceremony utensils are permanent and forever, whereas people are frail and fleeting. These themes of implicit incest, impossible love and impending death are again explored in Yama no Oto, set in Kawabata’s home town of Kamakura. The protagonist, an aging man, has grown disappointed of his children and has lost all passion for his wife. He is strongly attracted to someone forbidden — his daughter in law — and his thoughts for <b>her</b> <b>are</b> interspersed with memories of another forbidden love, for his dead sister-in-law.|$|E
