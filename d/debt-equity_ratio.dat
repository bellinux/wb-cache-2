40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} the federal tax structure on corporate financial and investment behavior. We first develop a model of corporate behavior given taxes, taking into account both uncertainty and costs of bankruptcy. Simpler models abstracting from bankruptcy costs had clear counterfactual implications. The forecasts from our model proved to be consistent with both the observed cross-sectional variation in <b>debt-equity</b> <b>ratios</b> and the time series pattern of <b>debt-equity</b> <b>ratios</b> (data that were constructed in the paper). We then attempted to measure the efficiency costs created by corporate tax distortions as implied by the model. The forecasted efficiency cost of the distortion favoring debt finance seemed to be quite large, while the tax distortion affecting investment seemed to be less important than others have claimed. The paper concludes with a study of the efficiency implications of various proposed corporate tax changes. ...|$|R
40|$|MBA thesis - WBSThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of a declining market trend or bear period on the capital structure of companies listed on the JSE between 1999 and 2003. A significant finding using nonparametric statistical analysis, was that the sector <b>debt-equity</b> <b>ratios</b> had remained unchanged over the bear period. However, once companies were divided into categories defined by return on investment (ROI), cost of debt, price-to-book ratio and the net operating profit after tax (NOPAT), some changes in capital structure were apparent. Firstly, for companies with an ROI greater than the cost of debt and a price-to-book ratio greater than the median it was found that the overall debt to equity ratios of these firms had remained unchanged. However, as the definition of debt included both interest and non-interest bearing liabilities, the increased use of debt as a proportion of total liabilities was confirmed through additional hypothesis testing. This suggested that companies with a price-to-book ratio greater than the median derived increased benefit from the tax shield and engaged in value maximising behaviour. Companies that had an ROI greater than the cost of debt and a price-to-book ratio less than the median maintained their <b>debt-equity</b> <b>ratios</b> and did not increase the proportion of interest- bearing to total liabilities. Companies with a cost of debt less than the return on investment, implying reduced profitability, were classified further into those with a positive and a negative NOPAT. For firms with a positive NOPAT it was found that these firms resorted to increased debt funding and the greater use of short term liabilities in particular. This finding was regarded as consistent with the behaviour of less profitable firms that tended to resort to increased levels of debt financing to maintain III financial flexibility, although this finding may have been independent of the economic cycle. Lastly, companies with a cost of debt less than ROI and a negative NOPAT were found to have significantly increased their <b>debt-equity</b> <b>ratios</b> as compared to before the bear period. As the levels of debt remained unchanged, however, the increased <b>debt-equity</b> <b>ratios</b> were shown to be a direct result of cumulative retained losses, which had eroded shareholders’ equity. Overall, the findings did not support the active management of capital structure, which would have entailed the retiring of debt during bear periods yielding a decrease in <b>debt-equity</b> <b>ratios.</b> The results did seem to show evidence of consistent financial policy, particularly for companies with a return on investment greater than the cost of deb...|$|R

40|$|Capital {{structure}} {{has been one}} of the most controversial issues in the ground of finance during past decades. Although there have been a number of existing theories and empirical studies observing patterns involved in choosing a capital structure, until now, there is no universal one. In this regard, this dissertation attempts to explain the capital structures. The capital structures in this case involve the study of 6 ratios regarding to debt-to-equity, debt-to-assets, and equity-to-assets, or this research can be called the study of debt-equity structures. This study attempts to answer the question concerning the debt-equity structures of the pharmaceutical companies listed in the SEC during the period 1998 to 2008. With the objective to investigate whether the pharmaceutical firms pursue the target <b>debt-equity</b> <b>ratios</b> or not, the report employs the simple regression analysis developed from the Partial Adjustment Model. The results from the methodology reveal that is the weak evidence support <b>debt-equity</b> <b>ratios</b> of pharmaceutical firms in the sample converge to the industry mean. Though, the results give strong support that most firms’ ratios have been moved toward the target ratio. In this regard, unavoidable research limitations are also mentioned for further studies...|$|R

40|$|This study {{expands the}} earlier {{research}} {{relating to the}} optimal capital structure propositions, by studying the impact of debt on share prices {{as a result of}} the changes in the <b>debt-equity</b> <b>ratio.</b> This paper expects to expand our understanding by postulating that there are actually 2 effects at work. The first is the signaling effect on share prices by announcement of 'debt' as the chosen means of financing. The second effect being the movement of the firm's <b>debt-equity</b> <b>ratio</b> relative to its industry median <b>debt-equity</b> <b>ratio.</b> It is argued that there would be an increase (decrease) in abnormal share returns when debt financing moves capital structure of a firm closer to (away from) the industry median <b>debt-equity</b> <b>ratio.</b> The abnormal returns observed at the disclosure time of debt issues are found to be significantly correlated with the capital structure changes. Thus, this study expects to fill a gap in the literature by showing the relationship between capital structure changes and the abnormal share returns at the time of debt issues.

Estimates show that the overall cost of capital is U-shaped, first falling and then rising as the <b>debt-equity</b> <b>ratio</b> rises, and this relationship has far-reaching implications for the effectiveness of interest rate policy.

40|$|Aggregate {{statistics}} readily indicate why so {{many observers}} of financial markets in the United States {{are concerned about the}} balance between debt and equity in the corporate financial decision. Exceeding zero in most years before 1984, net equity issues by U. S. nonfinancial corporations have been negative in each year since. Net redemptions averaged approximately $ 80 billion annually during the period 1984 - 87, and then rose in 1988 to $ 131 billion. Over the same period, net new borrowing by the nonfinancial corporate sector rose sharply, with outstanding credit market debt growing annually by nearly $ 170 billion during 1984 - 87 and by $ 189 billion in 1988 (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 1989). <b>Debt-equity</b> <b>ratios</b> can be calculated in many ways, however, and not every measure provides such a sharp picture of recent events. The change in the value of corporate equity over any period equals net equity issues plus changes in the value of existing equity. Because of the strong performance of the stock market during the 1980 s, the ratio of the stock of debt to the stock of equity, measured at market value, began rising only in 1987, the year of the stock market crash.

40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} how managerial equity ownership affects the capital structure choice (<b>debt-equity</b> <b>ratio)</b> of non-financial firms {{listed on the}} Karachi Stock Exchange in Pakistan between 2008 and 2012.

40|$|The {{paper is}} a first step to tests the impact of bank-firm-relationships on {{corporate}} performance under changing economic conditions. Using a data set of standardized annual financial statements of 100 Japanese corporations all listed at the First Section of the Tokyo stock exchange, at the current stage of analysis we find empirical evidence that: (1) investment is determined by output expectations. (2) Q is a significant variable for investment behavior. (3) Investment is restricted by <b>debt-equity</b> <b>ratio,</b> (4) therefore the much claimed signaling effect of a high <b>debt-equity</b> <b>ratio</b> does not hold. (5) In contrast to Germany though, banks allow firms with bank-relationships higher short term debt to total finance and long term loans to total finance ratios, whereas firms with no relationships have a higher equity ratio. (6) Banks influence firms with bank-relationships to decide on low risk investment decisions. Therefore they are able to allow a higher <b>debt-equity</b> <b>ratio</b> (in contrast to Germany). (7) Non-bank-related firms are much more profitable than bank-related firms. The difference is even stronger than in Germany. Yet they also have to bear a higher amount of risk. (8) Apparently the policy of banks in Japan is much different to German banks: Banks force bank-affiliated firms to follow an investment policy, which is much more cautious and therefore leads to less profitability. This again leads to a bank-policy that allows to supply these firms with higher amounts of borrowings. ZUSAMMENFASSUN...|$|E
