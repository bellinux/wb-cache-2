The same study also found that state laws that required background checks for all gun sales were strongly associated with lower rates of gun-related deaths.|$|E

He also expanded employee benefits to same-sex partners of city workers, and advocated <b>for</b> <b>gun</b> control. Daley was a national leader in privatization and the lease and sale of public assets to private corporations.|$|E
5|$|Casualties {{suffered}} in the action were relatively heavy on both sides. The British ships, with their reduced crews, suffered 61 men killed or wounded while the French lost over 50 on Pomone alone. There were no casualties on Persanne, and Paulines losses are unknown, although believed to be heavy given her battered condition. The French also lost the cargo aboard Persanne and Pomone, which amounted to 201 bronze and iron cannon, 220 iron wheels <b>for</b> <b>gun</b> carriages and numerous other military stores.|$|E
5|$|In May 1940, the Directorate of Fortifications and Works (FW3) {{was set up}} at the War Office. Its {{purpose was}} to provide basic pillbox designs which could be {{constructed}} by soldiers and local labour at appropriate defensive locations. In the following June and July FW3 issued 6 basic designs for rifle and light machine gun pillboxes, designated Type 22 to Type 27. In addition, there were designs <b>for</b> <b>gun</b> emplacements suitable for either the Ordnance QF 2 pounder or the Hotchkiss 6 pounder gun (designated Type 28) and a design for a hardened medium machine gun emplacement.|$|E

5|$|Obligatory {{psychological}} testing <b>for</b> <b>gun</b> owners is {{a common}} subject of discussion, but {{it has always been}} rejected. Gun advocates point out that the nature of the tests and the parties responsible for them are not clear. It is also pointed out that it is unlikely that any psychological testing would reveal a potentially dangerous individual, because some famous killers in the past were members of the military or the law enforcement and passed very difficult psychological testing successfully.|$|E
5|$|After winning {{re-election}} by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama {{was sworn}} in {{for a second term}} in 2013. During his second term, Obama promoted inclusiveness for LGBT Americans, with his administration filing briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges). Obama advocated <b>for</b> <b>gun</b> control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning climate change and immigration. In foreign policy, Obama ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating. He currently resides in Washington, D.C. His presidential library will be built in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|During {{her second}} commission, Indiana {{spent most of}} her time laid up in the reserve fleet, {{occasionally}} participating in practice cruises. In January 1907 she helped provide relief {{in the aftermath of the}} 1907 Kingston earthquake. In 1908, the /40 caliber guns and most of the lighter guns were removed to compensate for the counterweights added to the main battery turrets and because the ammunition supply for the guns was considered problematic. A year later, twelve /50 caliber single-purpose guns were added midships and in the fighting tops. At the same time a cage mast was added. By 1913 it was speculated that the ship might soon be used for target practice, but instead, the ship was decommissioned on 23 May 1914. After the United States entered World War I, Indiana was commissioned for the third time and served as a training ship <b>for</b> <b>gun</b> crews near Tompkinsville, Staten Island and in the York River, and placed under the command of George Landenberger.|$|E

5|$|Indiana {{served in}} the Spanish–American War (1898) {{as part of the}} North Atlantic Squadron. She took part in both the {{blockade}} of Santiago de Cuba and the battle of Santiago de Cuba, which occurred when the Spanish fleet attempted to break through the blockade. Although unable to join the chase of the escaping Spanish cruisers, she was partly responsible for the destruction of the Spanish destroyers Plutón and Furor. After the war she quickly became obsolete—despite several modernizations—and spent most of her time in commission as a training ship or in the reserve fleet, with her last commission during World War I as a training ship <b>for</b> <b>gun</b> crews. She was decommissioned for the third and final time in January 1919 and was shortly after reclassified Coast Battleship Number 1 so that the name Indiana could be reused. She was sunk in shallow water as a target in aerial bombing tests in 1920 and her hull was sold for scrap in 1924.|$|E
5|$|These {{features}} {{have made}} Gibraltar a naturally strong defensive position. The isthmus lacks any natural cover, exposing any approaching enemy to opposing fire. The heights of the Rock form a natural barrier to movement and rocky ledges provide natural platforms <b>for</b> <b>gun</b> batteries. The sheer cliffs {{on the north}} and east sides of the Rock block access from those directions and the sea cliffs around {{the southern end of the}} peninsula make landings there difficult, especially if opposed. A single road connects Gibraltar with Spain, and within the territory most roads are narrow and often steep due to the restricted land area. Over the centuries, Gibraltar's successive occupants have built an increasingly complex set of fortifications around, on top of and incorporating the territory's natural features.|$|E
