5|$|Khalid {{utilized}} {{his better}} understanding of terrain in every possible way to gain strategic superiority over his enemies. During his Persian campaigns, he initially never entered deep into Persian territory and always kept the Arabian desert at his rear, allowing his forces to retreat there {{in case of a}} defeat. It was only after all the strong Persian and Persian-allied forces were routed that he penetrated deep into Euphrates region and captured the regional capital of Iraq, Al-Hira. Again, at Yarmouk, the terrain would help him in executing his <b>grand</b> <b>strategy</b> of annihilating the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|During 1942, Allied {{officials}} debated on {{the appropriate}} <b>grand</b> <b>strategy</b> to pursue. All agreed that defeating Germany {{was the primary}} objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on Germany through France. The Soviets were also demanding a second front. The British, on the other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. Germany itself {{would be subject to}} a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without using large-scale armies. Eventually, the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa.|$|E
5|$|The Army of Rhin-et-Moselle led by Jean Victor Marie Moreau was {{deployed}} {{with its}} right flank at Huningue, its {{center on the}} Queich River and its left flank at Saarbrücken. The Army of Sambre-et-Meuse commanded by Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was responsible for a line running north from Sankt Wendel to Cologne, while the 22,000 men of its left wing under Jean-Baptiste Kléber held Düsseldorf. The French <b>grand</b> <b>strategy</b> designed by Minister of War Lazare Carnot was for each of their two armies to turn the Austrian flanks. The strategic plan called for Jourdan to start by advancing by his left wing and was designed to accomplish two goals. First, {{it was hoped that}} this would cause the Austrians to abandon {{the west bank of the}} Rhine. Second, the move would draw Austrian strength north and allow Moreau's army a better chance to cross the Rhine in the south.|$|E

5|$|A {{long period}} of peace between Parthia and Rome ensued, with only the {{invasion}} of Alans into Parthia's eastern territories around 72AD mentioned by Roman historians. Whereas Augustus and Nero had chosen a cautious military policy when confronting Parthia, later Roman emperors invaded and attempted to conquer the eastern Fertile Crescent, {{the heart of the}} Parthian Empire along the Tigris and Euphrates. The heightened aggression can be explained in part by Rome's military reforms. To match Parthia's strength in missile troops and mounted warriors, the Romans at first used foreign allies (especially Nabataeans), but later established a permanent auxilia force to complement their heavy legionary infantry. The Romans eventually maintained regiments of horse archers (sagittarii) and even mail-armored cataphracts in their eastern provinces. Yet the Romans had no discernible <b>grand</b> <b>strategy</b> in dealing with Parthia and gained very little territory from these invasions. The primary motivations for war were the advancement of the personal glory and political position of the emperor, as well as defending Roman honor against perceived slights such as Parthian interference in the affairs of Rome's client states.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{a series of}} operations against the Japanese bastion at Rabaul, which blocked any Allied advance along the northern coast of New Guinea towards the Philippines or northward towards the main Japanese naval base at Truk. In keeping with the overall Allied <b>grand</b> <b>strategy</b> of Europe first, the immediate aim of these operations was not the defeat of Japan but merely {{the reduction of the}} threat posed by Japanese aircraft and warships based at Rabaul to air and sea communications between the United States and Australia. By agreement among the Allied nations, in March 1942 the Pacific theatre was divided into the South West Pacific Area, under General Douglas MacArthur, and the Pacific Ocean Areas, under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. Rabaul fell within MacArthur's area but the initial operations in the southern Solomon Islands came under Nimitz. The Japanese reaction was more violent than anticipated and some months passed before the Guadalcanal Campaign was brought to a successful conclusion. Meanwhile, General MacArthur's forces—primarily Australian—fought off a series of Japanese offensives in Papua in the Kokoda Track Campaign, Battle of Milne Bay, Battle of Buna-Gona, and the Battle of Wau.|$|E
5|$|Poland brought mercenaries from Moravia and Bohemia. The Czechs {{produced}} two full banners, {{under the command}} of Jan Sokol of Lamberk. Serving among the Czechs was possibly Jan Žižka, future commander of the Hussite forces. Alexander the Good, ruler of Moldavia, commanded an expeditionary corps. Vytautas gathered troops from Lithuanian, Ruthenian (modern Belarus and Ukraine) and Russian lands. The three Russian banners from Smolensk were {{under the command of}} Władysław II Jagiełło's brother Lengvenis, while the contingent of Tatars of the Golden Horde was under the command of the future Khan Jalal ad-Din. The overall commander of the joint Polish–Lithuanian force was King Władysław II Jagiełło; however, he did not directly participate in the battle. The Lithuanian units were commanded directly by Grand Duke Vytautas, who was second in command, and helped design the <b>grand</b> <b>strategy</b> of the campaign. Vytautas actively participated in the battle, managing both Lithuanian and Polish units. Jan Długosz stated that the low-ranking sword bearer of the Crown, Zyndram of Maszkowice, commanded the Polish army, but that is highly doubtful. More likely, marshal of the Crown Zbigniew of Brzezie commanded the Polish troops in the field.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{examines}} {{the foreign policy}} discourse in contemporary Germany. In reviewing {{a growing body of}} publications by German academics and foreign policy analysts, it identifies five schools of thought based on different worldviews, assumptions about international politics, and policy recommendations. These schools of thought are then related to, first, actual preferences held by German policymakers and the public more generally and, second, to a small set of <b>grand</b> <b>strategies</b> that Germany could pursue in the future. It argues that the spectrum of likely choices is narrow, with the two most probable-the strategies of "Wider West" and "Carolingian Europe" [...] -continuing the multilateral and integrationist orientation of the old Federal Republic. These findings are contrasted with diverging assessments in the non-German professional literature. Finally, the essay sketches avenues for future research by suggesting ways for broadening the study of country-specific <b>grand</b> <b>strategies,</b> developing and testing inclusive typologies of more abstract foreign policy strategies, and refining the analytical tools in examining foreign policy discourses in general...|$|R

40|$|Effective {{national}} leaders throughout history have deliberately developed <b>grand</b> <b>strategies</b> and successfully implemented them to attain their political goals, while also integrating and accomplishing economic, social, defense, and sometimes religious objectives. Not all {{leaders have been}} successful, however, as this process is immensely complex and can be adversely affected {{by the actions of}} other leaders around their region and the world. It bears examination, then, to determine what factors contribute to successful <b>grand</b> <b>strategies</b> and why many leaders fail to reach their stated ends. This article utilizes a historic case study approach and explores three key areas of grand strategy: universal principles, Clausewitzian approaches, and indirect approaches. I handle each separately and in distinct fashion, though some connective tissue does interlace across sections. Additionally, the unifying argument is that thoughtful, rational leaders, who weigh the costs and benefits associated with each course of action available to them, still must heed the truths embedded in these three sections to attain their objectives. Not doing so often leads to failure, unrealized goals, and a nation gone awry...|$|R

25|$|As CIGS, Brooke had {{a strong}} {{influence}} on the <b>grand</b> <b>strategy</b> of the Western Allies. The war in the west unfolded more or less according to his plans, at least until 1943 when the American forces still were relatively small {{in comparison to the}} British.

25|$|The <b>grand</b> <b>strategy</b> favoured at Dublin, {{of attacking}} by {{land and sea}} simultaneously, was {{probably}} impossible with English resources, given the rumours of a fresh Armada from Spain {{and the need to}} keep warships in southern waters. The amphibious expedition to establish a northern base at Lough Foyle was abandoned, and the Dublin Council switched from an immediate attack on O'Neill and his confederate, Hugh Roe O'Donnell, when it became clear the strategy would fail through want of forage, cattle, and draught-horses. But this advice was declined by the Privy Council at London, which settled on a straight attack north into Ulster.|$|E
25|$|In January 1943, the Okabe Detachment was {{defeated}} in {{an attack on the}} Australian base of Wau, about 40 kilometres (25mi) away.

This also diverted attention from Lae, which was a major objective of Operation Cartwheel, the Allied <b>grand</b> <b>strategy</b> for the South Pacific. It was decided that the Japanese would be pursued towards Salamaua by the Australian 3rd Division, which had been formed at Wau, under the command of Major General Stanley Savige, who were to link up with elements of the US 41st Infantry Division.|$|E
