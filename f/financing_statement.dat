50|$|In {{the case}} of a loan secured by {{personal}} property collateral, the filing of a <b>financing</b> <b>statement</b> gives notice of a lien against the property so that other lenders or buyers of the personal property will know of the security interest. In {{the case of}} a filing of a <b>financing</b> <b>statement</b> by a lessor of fixtures, the filing of the <b>financing</b> <b>statement</b> gives notice of the lessor's interests to others who acquire an interest in the real property and related fixtures. The <b>financing</b> <b>statement</b> does not create a lien nor does it create any additional rights against a lessee in favor of a lessor, the filing of a <b>financing</b> <b>statement</b> just gives notice of whatever rights the creditor or lessor have under their loan documents or lease, respectively.|$|E

5000|$|Remnants of {{this common}} law {{doctrine}} exist {{today in the}} United States in the Uniform Commercial Code. Name changes can mislead searchers of official records of titles or liens. Article 9 of the UCC states that a <b>financing</b> <b>statement</b> shall not perfect a valid security interest if a name change would be [...] "seriously misleading.". A creditor may gain priority over other creditors {{in the event of}} a bankruptcy by filing a <b>financing</b> <b>statement.</b> The <b>financing</b> <b>statement</b> contains information relevant to the secured transaction and puts other creditors on notice that the filer has a secured interest in the property. Should the filer use a debtor name that is substantially different from the debtor's actual name, the purpose of filing the <b>financing</b> <b>statement</b> is defeated. On the other hand, if there is a minor difference in spelling or an idem sonans, the error is not fatal, but only if it is not seriously misleading. The actual search results may reveal a debtor with a similar name and address which would put the researcher on notice to investigate further, which is the purpose of the filing in the first place. The legal effect of an idem sonans is that the minor name difference shall have no bearing on the priority of debtors.|$|E

5000|$|A UCC-1 <b>financing</b> <b>statement</b> (an {{abbreviation}} for Uniform Commercial Code-1) {{is a legal}} form that a creditor files to give notice that it has or may {{have an interest in}} the personal property of a debtor (a person who owes a debt to the creditor as typically specified in the agreement creating the debt). This form is filed in order to [...] "perfect" [...] a creditor's security interest by giving public notice that there is a right to take possession of and sell certain assets for repayment of a specific debt with a certain priority. Such notices of sale are often found in the local newspapers. Once the form has been filed, the creditor establishes a relative priority with other creditors of the debtor. This process is also called [...] "perfecting the security interest" [...] in the property, and this type of loan is a secured loan. [...] A <b>financing</b> <b>statement</b> may also be filed in the real estate records by a lessor of fixtures to establish the priority of the lessor's rights against a holder of a mortgage or other lien on the real property. The creditor's rights against the debtor and the lessor's rights against the lessee are based on the credit documents and the lease, respectively, and not the <b>financing</b> <b>statement.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The holder may [...] "perfect" [...] the {{security}} interest to put third parties on notice thereof. Perfection is typically achieved by filing a <b>financing</b> <b>statement</b> with government, often {{the secretary of}} state located at a jurisdiction where a corporate debtor is incorporated. Perfection can also be obtained by possession of the collateral, if the collateral is tangible property.|$|E
5000|$|For example, in a 2006 {{decision}} {{from one of}} the California Courts of Appeal, it was held that a creditor had failed to perfect its security interest in the strawberry crop of a debtor whose full true name was [...] "Armando Muñoz Juárez." [...] In accordance with Mexican naming convention, he frequently went by Armando Muñoz, and signed documents by that name, and the creditor's <b>financing</b> <b>statement</b> therefore referred to him as [...] "Armando Muñoz." [...] The court ruled: [...] "Debtor's last name did not change when he crossed the border into the United States. The 'naming convention' is legally irrelevant." [...] In other words, under the California implementation of the Uniform Commercial Code, the debtor's [...] "true last name" [...] was Juárez (his maternal surname).|$|E

50|$|In {{order for}} a {{security}} interest to attach to the collateral {{in the possession of}} subsequent purchasers, it must be perfected. If the security agreement is for a purchase money security interest, perfection is automatic. Otherwise, the lender must record either the agreement itself, or a UCC-1 <b>financing</b> <b>statement,</b> in an appropriate public venue (usually the state secretary of state or a state business commission under that person's authority). Perfecting the interest creates constructive notice, which is deemed legally sufficient to inform {{the rest of the world}} of the lender's rights in the collateral. Where a borrower has used the same property as collateral with respect to multiple security agreements made with different lenders, the first lender to record the interest has the strongest claim to that property.|$|E
50|$|The <b>financing</b> <b>statement</b> is {{generally}} {{filed with the}} office of the state secretary of state, in the state where the debtor is located - for an individual, the state where the debtor resides, for most kinds of business organizations the state of incorporation or organization. Many states have a state agency that operates under the secretary of state, which is tasked with overseeing business organizations and activities, including receipt of financing statements. However, an exception exists if the collateral is something that is tied to a particular piece of real property, such as timber, mineral rights, or fixtures. In that case, the filing must be made in the county where the property is located, usually in the recording office or county court, because that is where third parties are most likely to search for such record.|$|E
5000|$|As noted above, UCC Article 9's core insight {{was that}} the {{traditional}} distinctions were hopelessly obsolete, which was highly influential elsewhere and inspired {{the enactment of the}} Personal Property Security Acts throughout Canada during the 1990s. Although Ontario was the first province to enact such a law in 1990, all other Canadian provinces and territories followed the example set by Saskatchewan's PPSA enacted in 1993. The PPSAs are generally similar to UCC Article 9. However, they differ substantially on several issues such as the treatment of rental property, and the effectiveness of a <b>financing</b> <b>statement</b> after a debtor changes its name. Quebec has not enacted a PPSA but the sections of the 1994 Quebec Civil Code governing hypothecs were clearly influenced by the PPSAs and Article 9, and the province has made further amendments to the Civil Code to make possible more types of transactions that are already available in Article 9 jurisdictions.|$|E

5000|$|Attachment of a {{security}} interest does not ensure that the secured party's interest in the collateral will be superior to the interest of other lienors or subsequent buyers, lessees, or licensee. In general, to obtain priority over such other claimants, the security interest must be [...] "perfected." [...] Although some security interests are perfected automatically upon attachment, see U.C.C. § 9-309, for most perfection must be achieved through compliance with statutory procedure designed to give the world notice that the collateral is encumbered. The most common method of perfection is through filing a <b>financing</b> <b>statement</b> (often referred to by its form number: UCC-1) in the appropriate state office (usually {{the office of the}} Secretary of State) in the U.S. state in which the debtor is located.

40|$|This Article answers {{questions}} {{created by}} the <b>financing</b> <b>statement</b> requirements for sufficiency {{of the name of}} an individual debtor under the amendments to Uniform Commercial Code Article 9 —Secured Transactions. An individual debtor in a security interest transaction could be known by various names: birth certificate name, driver’s license name, passport name, or nickname. Revised Article 9 provides no guidance on what name is the correct name of the debtor for entry on the <b>financing</b> <b>statement,</b> and a <b>financing</b> <b>statement</b> that does not provide the correct name of the debtor does not perfect the security interest. To resolve this problem, the Joint Review Committee for Article 9 considered possible amendments to the individual debtor name requirements. Even the Joint Review Committee struggled with the issue, finally adopting two alternatives for sufficiency of the name of an individual debtor and asking states to choose between them. The Uniform Law Commission and the American Law Institute accepted the proposal and have offered the alternatives to the states, along with other amendments to Article 9. The proposed effective date of the amendments to Article 9 is July 1, 2013. To date, most states have adopted Alternative A to section 9 - 503 (a) (4) of amended Article 9. It is known as the “only if” rule. In accordance with this rule, a <b>financing</b> <b>statement</b> is sufficient only if it provides the name of the individual debtor as indicated on the debtor’s unexpired driver’s license. However, a secured party complying with section 9 - 503 (a) (4) Alternative A could still face many questions regarding the debtor’s name. This Article asks and answers twenty such questions.

40|$|Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) governs any {{transaction}} {{which creates}} a security interest in personal property or fixtures. Generally {{when there is}} a conflict between secured parties in the same collateral, the UCC’s default priority rule declares the first secured party to file a <b>financing</b> <b>statement</b> or perfect its interest to have priority. However, section 9 - 308 creates an exception to this default rule when the security interest is claimed in chattel paper. Chattel paper is a group of writings taken together that evidence both a monetary obligation and a security interest in or a lease of specific goods. Section 9 - 308 gives priority to a purchaser of chattel paper that perfects its interest in the chattel paper by taking possession.
