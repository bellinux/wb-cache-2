60|$|The Annuaire Statistique de la France, 1917, {{values the}} entire house {{property}} of France at $11,900,000,000 (59.5 milliard francs).[84] An estimate current in France of $4,000,000,000 (20 milliard francs) {{for the destruction of}} house property alone is, therefore, obviously wide of the mark.[85] $600,000,000 at pre-war prices, or say $1,250,000,000 at the present time, is much nearer the right figure. Estimates {{of the value of the}} land of France (apart from buildings) vary from $12,400,000,000 to $15,580,000,000, so that it would be extravagant to put the damage on this head as high as $500,000,000. <b>Farm</b> <b>Capital</b> for the whole of France has not been put by responsible authorities above $2,100,000,000.[86] There remain the loss of furniture and machinery, the damage to the coal-mines and the transport system, and many other minor items. But these losses, however serious, cannot be reckoned in value by hundreds of millions of dollars in respect of so small a part of France. In short, it will be difficult to establish a bill exceeding $2,500,000,000 for physical and material damage in the occupied and devastated areas of Northern France.[87] I am confirmed in this estimate by the opinion of M. René Pupin, the author of the most comprehensive and scientific estimate of the pre-war wealth of France,[88] which I did not come across until after my own figure had been arrived at. This authority estimates the material losses of the invaded regions at from $2,000,000,000 to $3,000,000,000 (10 to 15 milliards),[89] between which my own figure falls half-way.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{construct}} an empirical model {{for the analysis of}} two principal simultaneous decisions of farm operators: participation in the off-farm labor market, and the amount of resources to invest in <b>farm</b> <b>capital.</b> We first develop a theoretical model analyzing the effects of exogenous shocks on farmers' decisions. Then, we estimate jointly a multinomial probit model of farmers' off-farm labor supply and a switching regression model of <b>farm</b> <b>capital,</b> using a two-period panel data set from Israel. The longitudinal data enables to account for unobserved heterogeneity and structural state dependence. Both state dependence and heterogeneity lead to the same conclusion, that off-farm labor supply and <b>farm</b> <b>capital</b> are negatively associated. However, the heterogeneity model implies that farmers at the higher end of the ability distribution are able to both work off the farm and maintain a capitalintensive farm enterprise. The results show that <b>farm</b> <b>capital</b> investments during the 1970 's, which were enhanced by heavily subsidized credit, prevented farmers from seeking off-farm employment opportunities. Holding the capital stock constant would have resulted in a sharp increase, rather than a moderate decline, in farm operators' off-farm participation probabilities.

40|$|For an irrigator, {{investments}} in on-farm water infrastructure {{that increase the}} marginal productivity of water may improve use efficiency. However, increasing on-farm water use efficiency invariably diminishes return flows, compromising the ability to maintain sufficient water flows in streams to support natural environmental values, particularly in dry states of nature. As climate change can increase the probability of dry states, modelling that does not incorporate state-contingent treatments of uncertainty may misrepresent the benefits of public investment on irrigation infrastructure improvements to recover environmental water flows. This paper uses a state-contingent modelling approach to review an extended <b>farm</b> <b>capital</b> investment policy in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s Murray-Darling Basin. We examine technical efficiency gain implications for irrigation and environmental water managers under alternative states of inflow variability and the role that increasing climatic uncertainty has on policy objectives. Results suggest that the incentives provided to recover environment water via on-farm capital investments could have two principal negative feedbacks given future uncertainties. First, <b>farm</b> <b>capital</b> investments may encourage inflexible production systems that fail to respond to future water scarcity, exposing that investment to increased risk. Second, technical efficiency gains may reduce return flows, creating perverse policy outcomes aligned with meeting environmental objectives. Highlighting these ulterior policy outcomes provides irrigators and policy makers the capacity to adapt and develop flexible arrangements, robust policy, and management solutions that help negate future uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|In {{the early}} {{agricultural}} {{period in the}} United States, land and labor represented about 85 percent of all resources used, farms tended to be small, farmers had limited skill and experience in managing their farms. Each farmer produced food {{for himself and his}} family. Capital inputs represented about 15 percent of the total. About 5 decades ago a big change began in U. S. agriculture. The combined programs in research and education of the USDA and the Land-Grant Colleges resulted in discoveries of improved varieties of seeds and livestock, hybrid seed, fertilizer, new machinery, chemicals for diseases, and weed and insect control. The educational program provided modern agricultural information to farmers through extension workers. With changes in technology U. S. agriculture has grown more efficient, farms are more highly capitalized, mechanized and productive. Large quantities of capital are required to substitute for land and labor.
