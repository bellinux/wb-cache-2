40|$|Phase coding in a {{neural network}} {{composed}} of neural oscillators with inhibitory neurons was studied {{based on the}} theory of stochastic phase dynamics. We found that with increasing the coupling coefficients of inhibitory neural oscillators, the firing density in excitatory population transits to a critical state. In this case, when we increase the inhibitory coupling, the firing density will come into dynamic balance again and tend to a fixed value gradually. According to the phenomenon, in the paper we found parameter regions to exhibit those different population states, called dividing zones including flat <b>fading</b> <b>zone,</b> rapid <b>fading</b> <b>zone</b> and critical zone. Based on the dividing zones we can choose the number ratio between inhibitory neurons and excitatory neurons in the neural network, and estimate the coupling action of inhibitory population and excitatory population. Our research also shows that the balance value, enabling the firing density to reach the dynamic balance, {{does not depend on}} initial conditions. In addition, the critical value in critical state is only related to the number ratio between inhibitory neurons and excitatory neurons, but is independent of inhibitory coupling and excitatory coupling...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The ground {{conductivity}} {{is the most}} important factor in the transmitter’s coverage area in ground wave propagation. Regarding the day-to-day increase in digital broadcasting, a lower sensitivity of this kind of broadcasting and ability to create single frequency networks, it seems necessary to increase the accuracy of {{ground conductivity}} to minimize <b>fading</b> <b>zones.</b> The higher the abovementioned conductivity, the lower the ground wave attenuation. Also in this case, the transmitted wave will tilt less towards the ground to satisfy the boundary conditions in electric conductivity and so-called will enter the earth. In most of the presented papers to determine the field strength, conductivity is considered as known, but it’s dependent upon the soil genus, the annual/monsoon precipitation and the heat average. Here it is intended to provide a new method based on Mie algorithm to determine the conductivity based on the difference of Horizontal Electric Dipole near the ground. The previous conductivity measurements included determining it in a point by point manner in a low frequency and determining the conductivity based on the coverage area intensity. The new method holds the two methods advantages together. 44 Makki, Ershadi, and Abrishamian 1...|$|R

40|$|The geology of the {{southern}} part of the Nagssugtoqidian of W Greenland is examined in a traverse of the amphibolite <b>fades</b> Ikertoq <b>zone</b> at Søndre Strømfjord Airport. The continuous fanning of the foliation, shallow dips near the Archaean- Nagssugtoqidian boundary and steeper dips further north, is not indicative of a two-stage history for the zone. The structures of the deformed Kangåmiut dykes and the gneisses in which they occur have been studied in some detail. It is concluded that deformation synchronous with and postdating the intrusion of the dykes has been intense enough to rejuvenate the fabric of the gneisses to a post-intrusive age. /. van der Molen, Instituut voor aardwetenschappen, Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht, Budapestlaan 4, 3508 T...|$|R
40|$|Active {{tectonics}} {{within the}} Upper Tagus Basin {{is related to}} the lithospheric flexure affecting the Palaeozoic basement of the basin. This flexure displays NE-SW trending. Besides, this structure is in agreement with the regional active stress field defined by the maximum horizontal stress with NW-SE trending. In this tectonic framework, irregular clusters of instrumental seismicity (Mw< 5. 0) <b>fade</b> in the <b>zone</b> bounded by the Tagus River and the Jarama River valleys. These clusters are related to major NW-SE trending faults of suspected strike-slip kinematics. Moreover, reverse faults with NE-SW trending are affected by the strike-slip system as well. Despite the reverse faults are in agreement with the present SHMAX orientation, though, they apparently are blocked as seismogenic sources (scarce instrumental seismicity recorded today). In addition, we have determined the regional and local stress/ strain fields and two different fracture patterns were observed. Hence, we have divided the area in two zones: (1) the lateral bands of the basin, defined by reverse faulting (NE-SW trending) and strike-slip faulting (NW-SE trending) and (2) the central zone of the basin characterized by shallow normal faulting and NE-SW trending strike-slip faults. Furthermore, surface faulting and liquefac-tion structures are described affecting Middle to Late Pleistocene fluvial deposits, suggesting intrabasinal palaeoseismic activity (5. ...|$|R
