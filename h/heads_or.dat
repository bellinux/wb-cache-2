5|$|A 2014 {{study of}} falcons of {{different}} species (gyrfalcon, saker falcon, and peregrine falcon) used video cameras mounted on their <b>heads</b> <b>or</b> backs to track their approaches to prey. Comparison {{of the observed}} paths with simulations of different pursuit strategies showed that these predatory birds used a motion camouflage path consistent with CATD.|$|E
50|$|These illusionistic {{pictures}} {{present the}} viewer with a mental choice of two interpretations: <b>head</b> <b>or</b> landscape, <b>head</b> <b>or</b> objects, <b>head</b> <b>or</b> architecture, etc. Both {{of them are}} valid, but the viewer sees {{only one of them}} and very often he cannot see both interpretations simultaneously.|$|R

5|$|Cockatoos {{maintain}} their plumage with frequent preening throughout the day. They remove dirt {{and oil and}} realign feather barbs by nibbling their feathers. They also preen other birds' feathers that are otherwise hard to get at. Cockatoos produce preen-oil from a gland on their lower back and apply it by wiping their plumage with their <b>heads</b> <b>or</b> already oiled feathers. Powder-down is produced by specialised feathers in the lumbar region and distributed by the preening cockatoo all over the plumage.|$|E
5|$|Jim Martin, {{positioned}} {{in the lower}} right, gives a coy and perhaps mischievous glance back at the viewer. He {{is a microcosm of}} the entire scene in which no one appears to be giving thanks in a traditional manner of a Thanksgiving dinner. Solomon finds it a departure from previous depictions of Thanksgiving in that the participants do not lower their <b>heads</b> <b>or</b> raise their hands in the traditional poses of prayer. She sees it as an example of treating American traditions in both sanctified and casual ways. Theologian David Brown sees gratitude as implicit in the painting, while Kenneth Bendiner writes that Rockwell was mindful of the Last Supper and that the painting's perspective echoes its rendition by Tintoretto.|$|E
5|$|The marble was quarried from Mt. Pentelikon {{and transported}} 19km to the acropolis of Athens. A {{persistent}} {{question has been}} whether it was carved in situ. Just below the moulding and above the tenia there is a channel 17mm high that would have served to give access to the sculptor's chisel when finishing the <b>heads</b> <b>or</b> feet on the relief; this scamillus or guide strip is the best evidence there is that the blocks were carved on the wall. Additionally, on practical grounds {{it is easier to}} move a sculptor than a sculpture, and to use a crowbar to put them into place, potentially, could have chipped the edges. No information is recoverable on the workshop, but estimates range from three to 80 sculptors on the basis of style, however, Jenifer Neils suggests nine, on the grounds that this would be the least number necessary to produce the work in the time given. It was finished with metal detailing and painted. No colour, however, survives, but perhaps the background was blue, judging by comparison with grave stelae and the paint remnants on the frieze of the Hephaisteion. Possibly figures held objects that were also rendered in paint such as Poseidon’s trident and the laurel in Apollo’s hand. The many drill holes found in Hera’s and Apollo's heads indicate that a gilded bronze wreath would probably have crowned the deities.|$|E

5|$|The prisoners' {{day began}} at 4:30 am (an hour later in winter) with morning roll call. Dr. Miklós Nyiszli {{describes}} roll call as beginning 03:00 and lasting four hours. The weather was cold in Auschwitz {{at that time}} of day, even in summer. The prisoners were ordered to line up outdoors in rows of five and had to stay there until 07:00, when the SS officers arrived. Meanwhile, the guards would force the prisoners to squat for an hour with their hands above their <b>heads</b> <b>or</b> levy punishments such as beatings or detention for infractions such as having a missing button or an improperly cleaned food bowl. The inmates were counted and re-counted. Nyiszli describes how even the dead had to be present at roll call, standing supported by their fellow inmates until the ordeal was over. When he was a prisoner in 1944–45, five to ten men were found dead in the barracks each night. The prisoners assigned to Mengele's staff slept in a separate barracks and were awoken at 07:00 for a roll call that only took a few minutes.|$|E

50|$|A {{somewhat}} less obvious effect {{is caused by}} <b>head</b> <b>or</b> tailwinds. A headwind will slightly increase the relative velocity of the projectile, and increase drag and the corresponding drop. A tailwind will reduce the drag and the projectile/bullet drop. In the real world, pure <b>head</b> <b>or</b> tailwinds are rare, since wind is seldomly constant in force and direction and normally interacts with the terrain it is blowing over. This often makes ultra long range shooting in <b>head</b> <b>or</b> tailwind conditions difficult.|$|R

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems in using retina images for recognition is the <b>head</b> <b>or</b> eye movement in front of the fundus camera.

25|$|This {{probability}} is the p-value, considering only extreme {{results that}} favor heads. This {{is called a}} one-tailed test. However, the deviation can be in either direction, favoring either <b>heads</b> <b>or</b> tails. The two-tailed p-value, which considers deviations favoring either <b>heads</b> <b>or</b> tails, may instead be calculated. As the binomial distribution is symmetrical for a fair coin, the two-sided p-value is simply twice the above calculated single-sided p-value: the two-sided p-value is 0.115.|$|E

25|$|During {{its annual}} meeting, more than 2,500 {{participants}} from slightly fewer than 100 countries gather in Davos. Approximately 1,500 are business leaders, drawn from its members, 1,000 of the world's top companies. Besides these, participants included 219 public figures, including 40 {{heads of state}} or government, 64 cabinet ministers, 30 <b>heads</b> <b>or</b> senior officials of international organizations, and 10 ambassadors. More than 432 participants were from civil society, including 32 <b>heads</b> <b>or</b> representatives of non-governmental organizations, 225 media leaders, 149 leaders from academic institutions and think tanks, 15 religious leaders of different faiths, and 11 union leaders.|$|E
25|$|They tested {{this concept}} under three {{different}} conditions.

Second was a coin focus, where the person who tossed the coin mentioned that the coin was {{coming up with a}} lot of <b>heads</b> <b>or</b> tails. Finally there was a control condition in which there was nothing said by the person tossing the coin. The participants were also assigned to different groups, one in which the person flipping the coin changed and the other where the person remained the same.|$|E
