5|$|Potassium is {{the eighth}} or ninth most common element by mass (0.2%) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body,</b> {{so that a}} 60kg adult {{contains}} {{a total of about}} 120g of potassium. The body has about as much potassium as sulfur and chlorine, and only calcium and phosphorus are more abundant (with the exception of the ubiquitous CHON elements). Potassium ions are present {{in a wide variety of}} proteins and enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium in {{the body}} tends to {{accumulate}} in the kidneys and bones. The maximum safe dose of protactinium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> is 0.03 µCi that corresponds to 0.5 micrograms of 231Pa. This isotope, which might {{be present in the}} air as aerosol, is 2.5 times more toxic than hydrocyanic acid.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the tight}} control of enzyme {{activity}} {{is essential for}} homeostasis, any malfunction (mutation, overproduction, underproduction or deletion) of a single critical enzyme {{can lead to a}} genetic disease. The malfunction of just one type of enzyme out of the thousands of types present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> can be fatal. An example of a fatal genetic disease due to enzyme insufficiency is Tay-Sachs disease, in which patients lack the enzyme hexosaminidase.|$|E

5|$|Although the Coris were {{discouraged}} from working together at Roswell, {{they continued to}} do so, specializing in investigating carbohydrate metabolism. They were particularly interested in how glucose is metabolized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> and the hormones that regulate this process. They published fifty papers while at Roswell, with first author status going to {{the one who had}} done most of the research for a given paper. Gerty Cori published eleven articles as the sole author. In 1929, they proposed the theoretical cycle that later won them the Nobel Prize, the Cori cycle.|$|E
5|$|Calcium is {{the fifth}} most {{abundant}} element <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> and the most abundant metal. Calcium ions {{play a vital role}} in the physiology and biochemistry of organisms and the cell as electrolytes. They play an important role in signal transduction pathways, where they act as a second messenger, in neurotransmitter release from neurons, in contraction of all muscle cell types, and in fertilization. Many enzymes require calcium ions as a cofactor. Calcium ions outside cells are also important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes, as well as proper bone formation.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is the 15th most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} Earth's crust, and the fourth {{most abundant}} element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon's abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth enables this element {{to serve as a}} common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.|$|E

5|$|Deities {{were present}} {{not only in}} the heavens, but also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> itself. They were {{responsible}} for maintaining the body's five viscera, guarding the registers of life, and regulating the souls. There were five internal deities that were particularly important in Lingbao Daoism. The Great Unity lived in the head, along with Lordling and White Prime, who could descend into the liver and lungs. The Director of Destinies lived in the heart and sexual organs, and finally, the Peach Child lived in the lower dantian. Normally these deities resided in the heavens, but they could be activated by scriptural recitations to descend into the body.|$|E
5|$|In animals, the {{mitochondrial}} genome {{is typically}} a single circular chromosome that is approximately 16 kb long and has 37 genes. The genes, while highly conserved, may vary in location. Curiously, {{this pattern is}} not found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> louse (Pediculus humanus). Instead, this mitochondrial genome is arranged in 18 minicircular chromosomes, {{each of which is}} 3–4 kb long and has one to three genes. This pattern is also found in other sucking lice, but not in chewing lice. Recombination has been shown to occur between the minichromosomes. The reason for this difference is not known.|$|E
5|$|Microbes are {{important}} in human culture and health in many ways, serving to ferment foods, treat sewage, produce fuel, enzymes and other bioactive compounds. They are essential tools in biology as model organisms, and have been put to use in biological warfare and bioterrorism. They are a vital component of fertile soils. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> microorganisms make up the human microbiota including the essential gut flora.

30|$|Herein, {{we present}} a {{controllable}} and rapid approach to fabrication of small Se nanoparticles with a size less than 6 nm by using glucose as the reduction agent and glycerin as <b>the</b> stabilization agent. <b>In</b> comparison with <b>the</b> previous studies, this method is green and environment friendly since glycerin and glucose are compatible with <b>the</b> cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>bodies.</b> Smaller size would improve the absorbance efficiency of selenium nanoparticles in a human’s body and therefore would be widely used <b>in</b> supplying <b>the</b> trace selenium element in foods, vitamins and other medicines.|$|R
5|$|Polyphenols, {{which often}} have {{antioxidant}} properties in vitro, {{are not necessarily}} antioxidants in vivo due to extensive metabolism. In many polyphenols, the catechol group acts as electron acceptor and is therefore responsible for the antioxidant activity. However, this catechol group undergoes extensive metabolism upon uptake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body,</b> for example by catechol-O-methyl transferase, and is therefore {{no longer able to}} act as electron acceptor. Many polyphenols may have non-antioxidant roles in minute concentrations that affect cell-to-cell signaling, receptor sensitivity, inflammatory enzyme activity or gene regulation.|$|E
5|$|Similarly to {{the other}} rare-earth metals, {{lutetium}} has no known biological role, but it is found even in humans, concentrating in bones, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the liver and kidneys. Lutetium salts are known to occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature; the element is the least abundant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> of all lanthanides. Human diets have not been monitored for lutetium content, so it is not known how much the average human takes in, but estimations show the amount is only about several micrograms per year, all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants. Soluble lutetium salts are mildly toxic, but insoluble ones are not.|$|E
5|$|Technetium plays {{no natural}} {{biological}} role {{and is not}} normally found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body.</b> Technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission, and spreads more readily than many radionuclides. It appears to have low chemical toxicity. For example, no significant change in blood formula, body and organ weights, and food consumption could be detected for rats which ingested up to 15µg of technetium-99 per gram of food for several weeks. The radiological toxicity of technetium (per unit of mass) {{is a function of}} compound, type of radiation for the isotope in question, and the isotope's half-life.|$|E

5|$|The {{alveolar}} bone is the bone of the jaw which forms the alveolus around teeth. Like any other bone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body,</b> {{alveolar bone}} is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force {{is placed on}} a tooth. As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics, an area of bone under compressive force from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area of bone receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has {{a high number of}} osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.|$|E
5|$|Chromium, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, {{and lead}} have the {{greatest}} potential to cause harm on account of their extensive use, the toxicity {{of some of their}} combined or elemental forms, and their widespread distribution in the environment. Hexavalent chromium, for example, is highly toxic as are mercury vapour and many mercury compounds. These five elements have a strong affinity for sulfur; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> they usually bind, via thiol groups (–SH), to enzymes responsible for controlling the speed of metabolic reactions. The resulting sulfur-metal bonds inhibit the proper functioning of the enzymes involved; human health deteriorates, sometimes fatally. Chromium (in its hexavalent form) and arsenic are carcinogens; cadmium causes a degenerative bone disease; and mercury and lead damage the central nervous system.|$|E
5|$|Heparin occurs {{naturally}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body,</b> but {{the development}} of HIT antibodies suggests heparin may act as a hapten, and thus be targeted by the immune system. In HIT, the immune system forms antibodies against heparin when it is bound to a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4). These antibodies are usually of the IgG class and their development usually takes about five days. However, {{those who have been}} exposed to heparin {{in the last few months}} may still have circulating IgG, as IgG-type antibodies generally continue to be produced even when their precipitant has been removed. This is similar to immunity against certain microorganisms, with the difference that the HIT antibody does not persist more than three months. HIT antibodies have been found in individuals with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis who had no prior exposure to heparin, but the majority are found in people who are receiving heparin.|$|E
