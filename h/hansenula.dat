50|$|Under the G.I. Bill, Brock began {{attending}} Ohio State University in 1946, initially with {{aspirations of}} becoming a writer, yet still drawn to chemistry and science. He earned a B.Sc. (1949), M.Sc. (1950), and Ph.D. (1952)in botany, specializing in experimental mycology and yeast physiology. His graduate work centered on the mushroom Morchella esculenta and the yeast <b>Hansenula</b> anomala.|$|E
50|$|Some Pichia representatives can {{be found}} in raw milk and cheese, such as P. anomala (formerly named <b>Hansenula</b> anomala). P. anomala has been shown to combat the {{undesirable}} mold Aspergillus flavus, which contaminates food sources such as tree nuts and corn, and produces aflatoxins. Researchers of the Agricultural Research Service found that when pistachio trees were treated with P. anomala, the growth of A. flavus was inhibited up to 97%. In addition to inhibiting A. flavus, the yeast may also help protect other agricultural crops from unwanted molds that affect the crop’s taste, texture, yield, and safety. http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100127.htm In smeared-surface ripened cheese, the most important species is P. membranifaciens that also occurs on cream cheese. The formation of a so-called pellicle is typical. Another member of the genus, P. pastoris, is widely used in molecular biology and biotechnology as an expression system. P. angusta furthermore called <b>Hansenula</b> polymorpha, is a model organism for studying the functions of peroxisomes and their underlying molecular biology.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hansenula</b> polymorpha (also called Pichia angusta) {{is another}} methylotrophic yeast (see Candida boidinii). It can grow {{on a wide}} range of other substrates; it is thermo-tolerant and can {{assimilate}} nitrate (see also Kluyveromyces lactis). It has been applied to the production of hepatitis B vaccines, insulin and interferon alpha-2a for the treatment of hepatitis C, as well as to a range of technical enzymes.|$|E
50|$|Look-Pang is a {{traditional}} starch ball, originally from China. Its shape is a semicircular with 3-4 cm diameter.There are many ingredients such as garlic, galangal and pepper with mold and yeast.

50|$|It is {{difficult}} to extract large amounts of hirudin from natural sources, so a method for producing and purifying this protein using recombinant biotechnology has been developed. This {{has led to the}} development and marketing of a number of hirudin-based anticoagulant pharmaceutical products, such as lepirudin (Refludan), hirudin derived from <b>Hansenula</b> (Thrombexx, Extrauma) and desirudin (Revasc/Iprivask). Several other direct thrombin inhibitors are derived chemically from hirudin.|$|E
50|$|Pichia pastoris is a methylotrophic yeast (see Candida boidinii and <b>Hansenula</b> polymorpha). It {{provides}} an efficient {{platform for the}} production of foreign proteins. Platform elements are available as a kit and it is worldwide used in academia {{for the production of}} proteins. Strains have been engineered that can produce complex human N-glycan (yeast glycans are similar but not identical to those found in humans).|$|E
50|$|Candida boidinii is a yeast {{notable for}} its ability to grow on {{methanol}} (called methylotrophism). Like other methylotrophic species such as <b>Hansenula</b> polymorpha and Pichia pastoris, it is used as a platform for the production of foreign proteins. Yields in a multigram range of a secreted foreign protein have been reported.A computational method, IPRO, recently predicted mutations that experimentally switched the cofactor specificity of Candida boidinii xylose reductase from NADPH to NADH.|$|E
5000|$|The unusual {{characteristics}} {{described above}} render A. adeninivorans very attractive for biotechnological applications. On the one hand, it {{is a source}} for many enzymes with interesting properties and the respective genes, for instance glucoamylase, tannase, lipase, phosphatases and many others. On the other hand {{it is a very}} robust and safe organism that can be genetically engineered to produce foreign proteins. Suitable host strains can be transformed with plasmids. The basic design of such plasmids is similar to that described under <b>Hansenula</b> polymorpha and yeast expression platforms.|$|E
50|$|In Fig. 2 {{the general}} {{design of a}} vector (a genetic vehicle to {{transform}} a yeast strain into a genetically engineered protein producer). It must contain several genetic elements:1. A selection marker, required to select a transformed strain from an untransformed background -this can be done if for instance such an element enables a deficient strain to grow under culturing conditions void of a certain compound like a particular amino acid that cannot be produced by the deficient strain).2. Certain elements to propagate and to target the foreign DNA to the chromosome of the yeast (ARS and/or rDNA sequence).3. A segment responsible {{for the production of}} the desired protein compound a so-called expression cassette. Such a cassette is made up by a sequence of regulatory elements, a promoter that controls, how much and under which circumstances a following gene sequence is transcribed and as a consequence how much protein is eventually made. This means that the segment following the promoter is variable depending on the desired product - it could be a sequence determining the amino acids for insulin, for hepatitis B vaccine or for interferon. The expression cassette is terminated by a following terminator sequence that provides a proper stop of the transcription. The promoter elements of the O. polymorpha system are derived from genes that are highly expressed, from instance from the MOX gene, the FMD gene or the TPS1 gene mentioned before. They are not only very strong, but can also be regulated by certain addition of carbon sources like sugar, methanol or glycerol. In 2000 an informal society of scientists was founded named HPWN (<b>Hansenula</b> polymorpha worldwide network) founded by Prof. Marten Veenhuis, Groningen, and Prof, Dr. Gerd Gellissen, Düsseldorf. Every two years meetings are organized.|$|E

40|$|The {{regulation}} of the synthesis of four dissimilatory enzymes involved in methanol metabolism, namely alcohol oxidase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase and catalase was investigated in the yeasts <b>Hansenula</b> polymorpha and Kloeckera sp. 2201. Enzyme profiles in cell-free extracts of the two organisms grown under glucose limitation at various dilution rates, suggested that the synthesis of these enzymes is controlled by derepression - repression rather than by induction - repression. Except for alcohol oxidase, {{the extent to which}} catabolite repression of the catabolic enzymes was relieved at low dilution rates was similar in both organisms. In <b>Hansenula</b> polymorpha the level of alcohol oxidase in the cells gradually increased with decreasing dilution rate, whilst in Kloeckera sp. 2201 derepression of alcohol oxidase synthesis was only observed at dilution rates below 0. 10 h- 1 and occurred to a much smaller extent than in <b>Hansenula</b> polymorpha. Derepression of alcohol oxidase and catalase in cells of <b>Hansenula</b> polymorpha was accompanied by synthesis of peroxisomes. Moreover, peroxisomes were degraded with a concurrent loss of alcohol oxidase and catalase activities when excess glucose was introduced into the culture. This process of catabolite inactivation of peroxisomal enzymes did not affect cytoplasmic formaldehyde dehydrogenase. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Phytase is able {{to change}} phytic acid into the myo-inositiol and {{inorganic}} phosphate, so {{it has been used}} as a cereal food additive in monogastric animal’s food.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the higher {{alcohols}} (fusel oils) produced during the Indonesian tapé ketan fermentation using Amylomyces rouxii as the principal mold, alone or in combination with yeasts belonging to genera commonly found in the tapé ketan fermentation (Endomycopsis, Candida, and <b>Hansenula).</b> Total fusel oils increased with length of fermentation. Fusel oils detected in the product distillate included isobutanol and isoamyl and active amyl alcohols. No n-propanol was detected. Isobutanol and isoamyl alcohols were formed in the largest amounts. A. rouxii alone produced nearly the same quantity of fusel oils (total production, 275 mg/liter at 192 h) as it did in combination with Endomycopsis burtonii (total production, 292 mg/liter at 192 h). A. rouxii and Endomycopsis fibuliger produced fusel oils totaling 72 mg/liter at 32 h and 558 mg/liter at 192 h. A. rouxii in combination with Candida yeasts produced somewhat more fusel oils, ranging from 590 to 618 mg/liter at 192 h.

40|$|Bioconversion of {{cellulosic}} {{material into}} bioethanol needs cellulase complex enzymes that contain endoglucanase, exoglucanase and beta glucosidase. One {{of the most}} important organisms that produce cellulases is the filamentous fungi, Trichoderma reesei which able to secrete large amounts of different cellulases. These enzymes are probably the most widely used cellulases industrially, however, the cellulases excreted from fungi are not stable at high pH or high temperatures. In this study methylotrophic yeasts, Pichia pastoris and <b>Hansenula</b> polymorpha were used for the comparative heterologous production of endoglucanase II. Two synthetic egII genes with P. pastoris and H. polymorpha codon preferences were transferred into the yeasts. In addition, both expression vectors contained the pre-pro-sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating factor alpha to allow secretion of protein. Enzymes characterization demonstrated increasing thermal stability in both recombinants EGII compare with native enzyme from T. reesei and the <b>Hansenula</b> enzyme was more stable than Pichia in higher temperature. Biochemical properties determination on different substrates showed higher binding site affinity in Pichia than <b>Hansenula</b> and native one. We can conclude that P. pastoris and H. polymorpha are appropriate hosts for expression and production of endoglucanase with improved thermal stability...|$|E

The expression cassettes in these systems used the promoters for various genes, including the genes for formate dehydrogenase (FMD), methanol oxidase (MOX), and trehalose- 6 -phosphate synthase (TPS 1). H. polymorpha is rapidly becoming the system of choice for heterologous gene expression in yeast. Several production processes for recombinant pharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes have been developed based on gene expression in this strain. Another methylotrophic yeast, <b>Hansenula</b> ofunaensis, has also been evaluated for a transformation system (Yamada-Onodera et al. 1999, Yamada-Onodera et al. 2006) but development has not been completed.|$|E
40|$|A nitroalkane-oxidizing enzyme was {{purified}} to homogeneity from Neurospora crassa. The enzyme {{is composed}} of two subunits; the molecular weight of each subunit is approximately 40, 000. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of nitroalkanes to produce the corresponding carbonyl compounds. It acts on 2 -nitropropane better than on nitroethane and 1 -nitropropane, and anionic forms of nitroalkanes are much better substrates than are neutral forms. The enzyme does not act on aromatic compounds. When the enzyme reaction was conducted in an 18 O 2 atmosphere with the anionic form of 2 -nitropropane as the substrate, acetone (with a molecular mass of 60 Da) was produced. This indicates that the oxygen atom of acetone was derived from molecular oxygen, not from water; hence, the enzyme is an oxygenase. The reaction stoichiometry was 2 CH 3 CH(NO 2) -CH 3 + O 2 → 2 CH 3 COCH 3 + 2 HNO 2, which is identical {{to that of the}} reaction of 2 -nitropropane dioxygenase from <b>Hansenula</b> mrakii. The reaction of the Neurospora enzyme was inhibited by superoxide anion scavengers {{in the same manner as}} that of the <b>Hansenula</b> enzyme.
