5000|$|David Ward King {{often went}} by his middle name of [...] "Ward", {{and he wrote}} it as [...] "D. Ward King". His {{education}} was obtained in the Springfield, Ohio public schools and in Wittenberg College (now Wittenberg University) in Springfield. On December 29, 1880 he married Mary Willie (often spelled [...] "Wylie") Burbank of Danville, Kentucky in Springfield. Mary was born in Danville, Kentucky on September 23, 1859. Mary {{was the daughter of}} Austin Milton and Lettitia (Reed) Burbank. He moved from Springfield, Ohio to this Maitland, Missouri farm as a recently married young man and began farming there. While living on that farm, he invented the King Road Drag (very famous in its day), which made country roads passable in wet weather and is still credited with making possible reliable rural mail delivery and the practicality of the automobile.Probably as early as 1877 or 1878, his father, Robert Quigley King, obtained some 1597 acre near Maitland in Holt County, Missouri. Family stories hold that his father received this land as the only asset of value owned by a person who owed him a lot of money as the only available way to obtain payment of that debt. After obtaining this farm in that way, his father retained it, even though this acquired farm was in far-off Missouri. When his father had acquired this farm and decided to keep it, he had to do something with it. Ward was his answer. So, Robert Quigley sent his son Ward to this farm in the spring of 1879 to begin farming it. During that summer Ward helped to thresh grain. However, Ward and Mary apparently did not actually move there until January 1881.There is reason to believe that Ward's move to this farm was not completely voluntary, since, for generations back, there had been no farmers in his family. Years later, Robert Quigley King acquired another large tract of what was this time raw farm land in much closer Hancock County, Ohio, near the small village of Vanlue. In 1887, he sent his other surviving son, Robert Leffler King (who also went by his middle name, [...] "Leffler"), off to develop that land and farm it. Leffler arrived at this land without buildings in the [...] "thick of winter". There is no doubt that Leffler did not want to leave the ease of the family wealth in Springfield for a hard farm life. However, family members who knew him say he could not stand up to his father. So, he went, erected a house and farm buildings and otherwise developed the farm, overcoming many obstacles. He met and married his wife, Lola Montez Askam King, in the Vanlue community and brought up his family on this farm, which he called [...] "Grassland Farm". He describes his many hardships in his farm journal, which hardships were probably very similar to the ones Ward must have experienced in turning himself into a farmer on his Maitland farm.Logic suggests that Ward's fate was destined to be much the same. However, in Ward's case, his invention enabled him to turn his fate to his immense advantage. Family members state that the fact that the travels associated with the promotion of his invention took him away from the farm a lot was not something city-bred Ward considered to be disagreeable.

40|$|French suckler farmers need {{advice on}} the impact of the {{conversion}} to OF. To help them with their decision-making process, we constructed an LP model that optimises the farming system, taking OF constraints and nitrogen balance into account. According to the model, the shift to OF had a greater impact on a mixed crop-livestock farm system than on that of a <b>grassland</b> <b>farm.</b> As a result of the very high cost of organic N fertiliser and the necessity of maintaining the N balance, the shift to OF {{in the case of the}} mixed farm resulted in less emphasis on cereal and more emphasis on livestock. For this type of farm, a significant drop in its proportional costs due to extensification was sufficient to maintain the overall gross margin of the holding. For the extensive <b>grassland</b> <b>farm,</b> the production system remained almost the same after the conversion. In this case, only a slight area extensification was needed. Costs increased due to the higher price of the concentrates purchased, and a 30 % increase of the selling price of the meat was therefore necessary to maintain the overall gross margin...|$|E
40|$|Diffuse {{microbial}} {{pollution from}} agriculture {{is a key}} contributor to water quality impairment. Reducing the risk of microbial contamination of watercourses from agricultural sources requires both environmentally appropriate and socially acceptable mitigation and management approaches. A cross-disciplinary toolkit for on-farm microbial risk assessment is presented that can represent both social and environmental factors promoting or preventing the accumulation of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) within the farm environment, and also their subsequent transfer to watercourses. Four key risk criteria were identified as governing FIO loss from land to water. These were ‘accumulating E. coli burden to land’, ‘landscape transfer potential’, ‘infrastructure’ and ‘social and economical obstacles to taking action’. The toolkit {{can be used to}} determine (i) the relative risk of a farm enterprise contributing to microbial watercourse pollution and (ii) appropriate and targeted mitigation {{to reduce the risk of}} FIO loss from land to water. A comparison of the toolkit output with microbiological water quality draining from three contrasting <b>grassland</b> <b>farm</b> enterprises provided a preliminary evaluation of the prototype approach. When applied to 31 <b>grassland</b> <b>farm</b> enterprises the toolkit suggested that 0 % were categorised as negligible risk, 32 % low, 65 % medium, 3 % high and 0 % very high risk. Such qualitative risk-based tools can assist the policy community not only to target high risk areas, but also to develop mitigation strategies that are sensitive to the different ways in which risk is produced. Capacity for long-term cross-disciplinary research is argued to be the means by which these integrated and more sustainable solutions may emerge...|$|E

40|$|Agricultural {{intensification}} drastically reduces diversity {{at different}} scales of livestock farming systems (LFS). This homogenization process leads to environmental degradation and {{ignores the fact}} that multiple performance criterions often come in conflict. Taking advantage of diversity at different scales of LFS is a new challenge to improve sustainability. The diversity is considered here on a functional viewpoint, i. e. a variety of functions played by individual production entities involved in overall performance. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine how the diversity of individual production entities shapes the relationship between different performance criterions at the upper scale. We used two types of dynamic models representing contrasting LFS: extensive grassland suckling farms and intensive dairy herds. Both models include a certain level of functional diversity with production entities corresponding to different types of management practices (<b>grassland</b> <b>farm</b> model) or different types of females (herd model). With the <b>grassland</b> <b>farm</b> model, we studied how the biodiversity/production relationship was influenced by the functional diversity of management practices. With the herd model, we explored how production/efficiency relationship was influenced by the functional diversity of females. At the farm scale, we showed that interactions between the diverse management practices shaped the relationship between ecological and productive performance from a convex to a concave trade-off. Complementary effects resulting from the diversity of management practices thus improved the trade-off. Trade-off shape also depended on the level of farm intensity and it was less costly for the extensive farms to achieve viable levels of ecological performance. Increasing the complementary effect through increased diversity in management practices is likely to improve the conciliation between productive and ecological performance. At the herd scale, we observed a win–win situation between production and efficiency. However, at the highest levels of production, there was a production/efficiency trade-off; increases in either production or efficiency corresponded to distinct functional groups of females. Managing the functional groups of females with targeted practices is likely to improve the production/efficiency trade-off. We concluded from both case studies that functional diversity plays a key role in the relationship between multiple performance criterions. The next steps on the research agenda include exploring new spatial and temporal scales and accounting for environmental variability. A better understanding of the role of functional diversity can benefit from multi-criterions and multi-scale modelling approaches...|$|E

The main findings of this research were as follows. (1) Under free-grazing conditions, the cloned sheep showed excellent climatic and ecological adaptability. In extreme temperature conditions ranging from - 30 to 40 &#x 000 ba;C, the cloned sheep maintained acceptable body condition and behaved as other sheep. (2) The cloned sheep quickly adapted from a herd feeding strategy to the harsh environment and quickly exhibited a grazing regimen as other free-grazing sheep.

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} lessons from a UK {{case study in}} the {{management}} of diffuse microbial pollution from <b>grassland</b> <b>farm</b> systems in the Taw catchment, south west England. We report on the development and preliminary testing of a field-scale faecal indicator organism risk indexing tool (FIORIT). This tool aims to prioritise those fields most vulnerable in terms of their risk of contributing FIOs to water. FIORIT risk indices were related to recorded microbial water quality parameters (faecal coliforms [FC] and intestinal enterococci [IE]) to provide a concurrent on-farm evaluation of the tool. There was a significant upward trend in Log[FC] and Log[IE] values with FIORIT risk score classification (r 2 = 0. 87 and 0. 70, respectively and P< 0. 01 for both FIOs). The FIORIT was then applied to 162 representative grassland fields through different seasons for ten farms in the case study catchment to determine the distribution of on-farm spatial and temporal risk. The high risk fields made up only a small proportion (1 %, 2 %, 2 % and 3 % for winter, spring, summer and autumn, respectively) {{of the total number of}} fields assessed (and less than 10 % of the total area), but the likelihood of the hydrological connection of high FIO source areas to receiving watercourses makes them a priority for mitigation efforts. The FIORIT provides a preliminary and evolving mechanism through which we can combine risk assessment with risk communication to end-users and provides a framework for prioritising future empirical research. Continued testing of FIORIT across different geographical areas under both low and high flow conditions is now needed to initiate its long term development into a robust indexing tool...|$|E
40|$|Nitrate (NO 3 −) {{contamination}} of groundwater associated with agronomic activity is of major concern in many countries. Where agriculture, thin free draining soils and karst aquifers coincide, groundwater is highly vulnerable to nitrate contamination. As residence times and denitrification potential in such systems are typically low, nitrate can discharge to surface waters unabated. However, such systems also react quickest to agricultural management changes that aim to improve water quality. In response to storm events, nitrate concentrations can alter significantly, i. e. rapidly decreasing or increasing concentrations. The current study examines {{the response of}} a specific karst spring situated on a <b>grassland</b> <b>farm</b> in South Ireland to rainfall events utilising high-resolution nitrate and discharge data together with on-farm borehole groundwater fluctuation data. Specifically, {{the objectives of the}} study are to formulate a scientific hypothesis of possible scenarios relating to nitrate responses during storm events, and to verify this hypothesis using additional case studies from the literature. This elucidates the controlling key factors that lead to mobilisation and/or dilution of nitrate concentrations during storm events. These were land use, hydrological condition and karstification, which in combination can lead to differential responses of mobilised and/or diluted nitrate concentrations. Furthermore, the results indicate that nitrate response in karst is strongly dependent on nutrient source, whether mobilisation and/or dilution occur and on the pathway taken. This will have consequences for the delivery of nitrate to a surface water receptor. The current study improves our understanding of nitrate responses in karst systems and therefore can guide environmental modellers, policy makers and drinking water managers with respect to the regulations of the European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive (WFD). In future, more research should focus on the high-resolution monitoring of karst aquifers to capture the high variability of hydrochemical processes, which occur at time intervals of hours to days...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{properties}} that drive grassland {{production in the}} absence of mineral nitrogen applications and explanatory mechanisms thereof were sought in this study. Sixteen grassland farms varying in nitrogen inputs were selected in Counties Limerick and Clare, Ireland. Soil was sampled in 1995 and physical, chemical and biological properties analysed in the laboratory. Management data describing lime and fertiliser applications, grazing practices, soil disturbance, livestock and fodder production were obtained by interview. Grassland production for the year 1996 / 97 was measured as: stocking density; gross margin; and total energy required for livestock production, including maintenance, growth, offspring and milk and fodder sales, taking nongrassland feed energy into account. The botanical composition was determined in 1998. Data were not normally distributed therefore the research was conducted in an exploratory manner. Descriptive scatter graphs and statistics, bivariate nonparametric Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s rank correlation, multiple regression analyses, principle components analysis (PCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were implemented. Four farms were in conversion to organic management, seven were organically managed and one was conventionally managed. Four farms had not had fertiliser applications. Microbial biomass, bacterial popUlations, and arginine ammonification activity that was interpreted as N-mineralisation and N-immobilisation activities in vitro, were not extreme in productive farms. Production measured as grassland energy correlated (P < 0. 05) with: fertiliser inputs and mechanical disturbance; soil pH; depth to bedrock; soil plant-available magnesium and calcium contents, influences of which were direct. Root mass and N-mineralisation in vitro correlated inversely (P < 0. 05) with production. Influential factors were highly correlated with each other (P < 0. 05). Each influential factor, ordinated with variables correlated to it, gave rise to a production-related gradient of farms in PCA. A suite of N -mineralisation in vitro and its related variables reliably indicated <b>grassland</b> <b>farm</b> production in ordination space. Fertiliser and lime applications, vegetation, grazing, soil depth and metabiosis influenced bacterial populations and activities. Root mass and N-mineralisation rates in vitro were least in disturbed and mineral nitrogen fertilised soils. N-mineralisation in vitro was greatest in extensive farms and N-immobilisation in vitro indicated carbon abundance in botanically diverse swards. Soil microbial biomass, bacterial populations and activities behaved individualistically along a possible succession in grazed grassland. Based on observations, and on allosteric and catabolite repression of amino acid use, it was hypothesised that 2 ̆ 7 available carbon, AC, is used before organic nitrogen, ON 2 ̆ 7 is ammonified. However, ammonification in vitro was uncorrelated with soil organic carbon or soil nitrogen contents or C:N ratio, because soil C and N analyses applied in the study may not have accounted for microbe-available resources. Soil organic carbon content was relatively high, but least in the conventional farm. In contrast to other studies in the literature, soil organic carbon content was not correlated with microbial biomass and arginine ammonification but may be above threshold values needed to facilitate biological function in the soils examined. Available forms of C and N ought to be considered as interdependent determinants of soil organic matter turnover rates subject to fertiliser use and grazing in grassland soils...|$|E
