500|$|When {{finishing}} The Playboy, Brown felt {{guilt over}} {{still looking at}} Playmates and credits having come out in print with helping him overcome his shame. [...] While many have interpreted the book as a condemnation of pornography, to Brown {{it is about the}} guilt he was made to feel for using the media. [...] Some interpretations, such as those of Sullivan and Darrel Epp, see The Playboy demonstrating how the idealized images in pornography distort societal norms and expectations of beauty; one example cited is a scene in which Brown says he could only maintain an erection with one girlfriend if he fantasized about his favourite Playmates. [...] Brown has objected to this interpretation—rather, he sees it as a flaw in the work, in that it does not provide enough context for what he intended to communicate: that he had gotten into a relationship with a woman whom he did not find sexually attractive, and that if Playboy did not exist he would have fantasized about other <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b>|$|E

40|$|U članku se autor bavi fenomenom feminizma i slikom žene kakvu feminizam prikazuje kroz svoje povijesne faze. U prvome dijelu, polazeći od povijesti feminizma, autor prati mijenjanje slike žene u svakoj od pojedinih faza. Posebno se osvrće na problematiku tumačenja naravi i kulture, roda i spola, u drugome i trećem valu feminizma u kojima je pod utjecajima postmoderne i rodne teorije došlo do dekonstrukcije naravne slike žene. Naime, dok s jedne strane postmoderni feminizam (postfeminizam) dovodi u pitanje postojanja kategorije žene kao takve ističući da ne postoji žena (ut sic) nego postoji kategorija ženā (bjelkinje, crnkinje, lezbijke, heteroseksualne itd.), s druge strane, rodna teorija kategoriju žene smatra proizvodom kulture. U drugome dijelu rada, autor prema novijoj katoličkoj biblijsko–teološkoj antropologiji Ivana Pavla II. i Benedikta XVI. tumači naravnu sliku žene. Na kraju, imajući u vidu sliku žene prema »staromu feminizmu«, kao i utjecaj rodne teorije na naravnu sliku žene, autor u novome feminizmu vidi mogući put ne samo u očuvanju naravne slike žene, nego i mogućnost stvaranja drugačije kulture, kulture u kojoj žena ne bi bila diskriminirana. In {{the article}} the author {{deals with the}} {{phenomenon}} of feminism and the <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> portrayed by feminism through its historical phases. In the first section, starting {{from the history of}} feminism and its various phases, the author traces the changes in the <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in each individual phase. The author makes a special reference to the problem of interpretation of nature and culture, gender and sexuality {{in the second and third}} waves of feminism in which, under the influence of postmodernism and the gender theory, there came about a deconstruction <b>of</b> the natural <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> Namely, while on the one hand postmodern feminism (post–feminism) questions the existence of the category »woman« as such, emphasizing that »woman« does not exist (ut sic), but rather only a category <b>of</b> <b>women</b> (white, black, lesbian, heterosexual, etc.), on the other hand the gender theory considers the category »woman« a product of culture. In the second section of the essay the author explains the natural <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> according to the more recent Catholic bibilical–theological anthropology of John Paul II and Benedict XVI. Taking into account the <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> from the aspect of »the old feminism«, and the influence of the gender theory on the natural <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> the author sees in the new feminism a possible means not only of preserving the natural <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> but also the possibilty of creating a different culture, a culture in which women would not be discriminated...|$|R

500|$|Munro {{started the}} monthly party Vaseline (later renamed Vazaleen) in Toronto {{at a time}} when most gay clubs {{featured}} house music or other types of dance music. His hope was to draw a more diverse crowd: he said at the time, [...] "I'd like to do something that'll encompass all the freaks out there, myself included." [...] In addition to its stereotype-countering incorporation of punk and other rock music, his club night was also noted to be unusual for being located outside of the Church and Wellesley gay neighbourhood. It was atypical as well for having about 50 percent women attending the event. Munro said, [...] "I was determined to get women to attend and I did it in a really simple way. I put lots of <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and dyke icons on the posters and flyers—groups like The Runaways or singers like Nina Hagen and Carole Pope. I wanted women to know instantly that this was their space as much as anybody else's." [...] It began in the downstairs space at El Mocambo in late 1999, moved to the upstairs space in January 2000, and in late 2001, when El Mocambo was threatening to close, to Lee's Palace, where it continued as a monthly event until 2006; it continues to this day as an annual event as part the city's Pride Week festivities, to raise money for the Will Munro Fund for Queer and Trans People Living with Cancer.|$|E
500|$|Although Darwin gives plant-women {{the central}} role in each {{vignette}} (a reversal of Linnaeus's classification scheme, which focuses on the male), few of the representations stray from stereotypical <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> When the female and male reproductive organs are in a 1:1 ratio in a plant, Darwin represents traditional couplings. The women are “playful”, “chaste”, “gentle” and “blooming”. When the ratio is 1:2-4, the female becomes a “helpmate” or “associate” to the males, who have separate bonds to their “brothers”. Once he reaches 1:5-6, however, Darwin presents women as “seductive or wanton” or, at the other extreme, “needing protection”. By 1:8+, he presents “unambiguous metaphors of power and command, [...] being pictured as a saint, a reigning sovereign, a sorceress, a proto-industrialist [...] [...] [...] a priestess”. The images also present a largely positive view {{of the relationship between}} the sexes; there is no rape or sexual violence of any kind, elements central to much of Ovid and Linnaeus. There is also no representation of the marriage market, divorce or adultery (with one exception); the poem is largely pastoral. There are also no representations of intelligent women or women writers, although Darwin knew quite a few. The exception is the “Botanic Muse”, who has the botanical knowledge that the poem imparts; however, as Browne argues, few readers in the eighteenth century would have seen this as a liberating image for women since they would have been skeptical that a woman could have written the poem and inhabited the voice of the muse (they would have assumed that the anonymous writer was a man).|$|E

It remained in private hands for almost two centuries, used as a home and place of business, until the federal government purchased it in 1953 [...] An exceptionally large number of spirits, residents and visitors claim, inhabit the small house. These include: A woman in a brown dress standing near the fireplace, a heavy-set woman standing on the staircase {{and also in the}} kitchen, a man with long blond hair and wearing a blue jacket, a man wearing short pants and long stockings, a woman in a rocking chair on the third floor, a small boy who runs down the third floor hallway, a man dressed in Colonial-era clothing standing in the master bedroom, a man dressed in Colonial-era clothing seen on the second floor, a young girl with curly hair {{running up and down the}} staircase, an African American boy, and a German-looking craftsman.

500|$|The video {{stood out}} conspicuously to Aguilar for its chaotic texture through the rapid editing of the {{multiple}} shots that constituted it. The sudden and continuous changes of camera angles, scenes and the distance and mood seemed to produce an [...] "apparently incoherent combination of images that offered no stable anchor to provide the whole with a definitive interpretation", she added. Since chaos has traditionally {{been associated with the}} female ontogenetic principle as opposed to male principle of order, the video in turn came to be associated with duality between order/chaos, male/female, good/evil, light/dark etc. Aguilar also drew parallel between Metropolis and the music video. Madonna borrowed different phallic symbolism from the film, including the smoke-billowing chimneys, the tall skyscrapers and the oppressive environment of industrial work. However, unlike Metropolis which portrayed repression of a rebellious proletariat, the chaotic nature of [...] "Express Yourself" [...] video showed freedom instead. Caryn James from The New York Times added that [...] "asked about the video, [...] made a distinction that any honest feminist would respect, however politically incorrect it may seem. 'I have chained myself', she said. 'There wasn't a man that put that chain on me.' You don't have to buy Madonna's next loopy bit of symbolism—'I was chained to my desires'—to believe the feminist subtext she finds in the video. 'I do everything by my own volition. I'm in charge, O.K.' Madonna in chains, though, is far removed from those unfortunate women who don't know that they have options." [...] Madonna also complained about the feminist criticisms of her [...] "crotch-grabbing", saying that [...] "if male singers like Michael Jackson can get away with it, why can't women?" [...] Theorist Douglas Kellner further asserted that the video was a feminist critique of male fighting and brutality, with images of the male workers engaged in a boxing match at the end. According to him, Madonna deliberately appropriated traditional feminine images {{in the beginning of the}} video, but contrasted them with her [...] "crotch-hugging" [...] male poses near the end, and discordant <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> assuming the male position. As feminist author Susan Bordo pointed out, [...] "it is the postmodern nature of the video that has most entranced academic critics, and its various ways of constituting identities that refuse stability, that remain fluid, that resist definition." ...|$|E
