500|$|From August 2, {{the conference}} debated whether Peng should be disciplined, what {{punishment}} Peng should receive, {{and for what}} reasons. On August 16 the conference passed two resolutions. The first resolution condemned Peng {{as the leader of}} an [...] "anti-Party clique", and called for Peng's removal from the positions of Defense Minister and Vice-Chairman of the Military Commission. The resolution did not eject Peng from the Communist Party, and it allowed Peng to retain his position in the Politburo, but he was excluded from Politburo meetings for years. The second resolution recognized Mao's dominance within the Party and subtly {{called for an end to}} the policies of the Great Leap Forward. After Mao had rallied the rest of the Party against him, Peng's options were limited to stubbornly standing his ground, engaging in a humiliating self-criticism, or suicide. After private discussion with other senior leaders, Peng considered the prestige of Mao and the unity of the Party and agreed to make a self-criticism, which was publicly reviewed at the conference, in which he admitted that he had made [...] "severe mistakes" [...] associated with his [...] "rightist viewpoint", that he had been a follower of Li Lisan and Wang Ming, and in which he openly implicated his supporters in his [...] "mistakes". After the conference, Peng said privately to Zhou Enlai regarding his self-criticism: [...] "For the first time in my life, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> out against my very heart!" [...] Mao purged most of Peng's supporters from important offices following the conference, almost completely isolating Peng politically for the rest of his life. Peng later reflected that he was confused that Mao could have interpreted his private letter as a political attack, and wondered why, after thirty years of working together, Mao could not have discussed the matter privately with him, if Peng had indeed made the mistakes Mao claimed he did.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} who he thought the originator of the 2005 bombings in London was, Litvinenko responded saying, [...] "You know, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> about it earlier and I shall say now, that I know only one organization, which has made terrorism the main tool of solving of political problems.

"As the Lord liveth": that is, {{he swore}} he would marry her, and redeem the inheritance, {{if the other}} would not; for the phrase, [...] "as the Lord liveth", is {{the form of an}} oath, it is {{swearing}} by the living God; so the Targum, [...] "I say with an oath before the Lord, that as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> unto thee, so will I:do:" ...|$|E
2500|$|Many Muslim {{scholars}} {{think that}} it also has reference to Exodus 32:13, which reads [...] "Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swearest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, 20th-century writer D. H. Lawrence {{said that there}} {{could not be a}} more perfect work of the American {{imagination}} than The Scarlet Letter. Henry James once said of the novel, [...] "It is beautiful, admirable, extraordinary; it has in the highest degree that merit which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> of as the mark of Hawthorne's best things—an indefinable purity and lightness of conception...One can often return to it; it supports familiarity and has the inexhaustible charm and mystery of great works of art." ...|$|E

"What is more, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> [...] with {{a person}} worthy of trust, who says that [...] he sailed in an Indian ship caught in the fury [...] of a tempest [...] for 40 days out in the Sea of India, beyond the Cape of Soffala and the Green Islands towards west-southwest; and {{according}} to the astrologers who act as their guides, they had advanced almost 2,000 miles.

2500|$|In {{the gospel}} of John, however, {{the account of the}} Last Supper does not mention Jesus taking bread and [...] "the cup" [...] and {{speaking}} of them as his body and blood; instead, it recounts other events: his humble act of washing the disciples' feet, the prophecy of the betrayal, which set in motion the events that would lead to the cross, and his long discourse in response to some questions posed by his followers, in which he went on to speak {{of the importance of the}} unity of the disciples with him and each other. In , the evangelist attributes a long discourse to Jesus that deals with the subject of the living bread and in [...] contains echoes of Eucharistic language. The interpretation of the whole passage has been extensively debated due to theological and scholarly disagreements. Sir Edwyn Hoskyns notes three main schools of thought: (a) the language is metaphorical, and verse 63: [...] "The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> to you—they are full of the Spirit and life" [...] gives the author's precise meaning; (b) vv 51-58 are a later interpolation that cannot be harmonized with the context; (c) the discourse is homogeneous, sacrificial, and sacramental and can be harmonized, though not all attempts are satisfactory.|$|E

On 17 February 1540 Lady Rutland wrote more positively to Lady Lisle: [...] "My very good lady...And where ye be very desirous to have your daughter Mistress Basset {{to be one of the}} Queen's Grace's maids, and that ye would I should move her Grace in that behalf. These shall be to do your ladyship: to wit that I perceive right well the King's Highness' pleasure to be such that no more maids shall be taken in until such time as some of them that now be with the Queen's Grace be preferred. Albeit if ye will make some means unto Mother Lowe, who can do as much good in this matter as any one woman here, that she may make some means to get your said daughter with the Queen's said Grace; and in so doing I think ye shall obtain your purpose in every behalf and I for my part shall do the best I can to prefer her here for I would be right glad thereof both for the great honesty that is in her".|$|E
