40|$|SUMMARY: The 7 th EU {{framework}} programme for research (FP 7) aims to provide new impetus to Europe’s growth and competitiveness, in realising {{that knowledge is}} Europe’s greatest resource. The programme places greater emphasis {{than in the past}} on research that is relevant to the needs of European industry, to help it compete internationally, and develop its role as a world leader in certain sectors. For the first time the {{framework programme}} provides support for the best in European investigator-driven research, with the creation of a European Research Council. The FP 7 budget is 50 % higher compared with its predecessor. The paper focuses on advances in information and communication technologies (ICT) under FP 7 and on how the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry and facility management (FM) can benefit through a systematic involvement. The technologies under development, ranging from wireless sensor networks, cooperative smart objects, plug-and-play control architectures, technologies supporting the "Internet of Things", to ICT services supporting energy efficiency can benefit not only this sector, but the economy as a whole. Significant near-market research will be carried out in the two ICT <b>Joint</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Initiatives</b> (JTI) which are launched in 2008.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} aid combustor {{design to}} avoid and reduce thermo-acoustic oscillations. Non-linear {{heat release rate}} estimation and its modelling are essential for the prediction of saturation amplitudes of limit cycles. The heat release dynamics of flames can be approximated by a Flame Describing Function (FDF). To calculate an FDF, {{a wide range of}} forcing amplitudes and frequencies needs to be considered. For this reason, we present a computationally inexpensive level-set approach, which accounts for equivalence ratio perturbations on flames with arbitrarily-complex shapes. The influence of flame parameters and modelling approaches on flame describing functions and time delay coefficient distributions are discussed in detail. The numerically-obtained flame describing functions are compared with experimental data and used in an acoustic network model for limit cycle prediction. A reasonable agreement of the heat release gain and limit cycle frequency is achieved even with a simplistic, analytical velocity fluctuation model. However, the phase decay is over-predicted. For sophisticated flame shapes, only the realistic modelling of large-scale flow structures allows the correct phase decay predictions of the heat release rate response.

Within the framework of the <b>Joint</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Initiative</b> Clean Sky (JTI-CS) project, and during the first phase of the Green Regional Aircraft Integrated Technological Demonstration (GRA-ITD), the authors focused on the design and technological demonstration of an innovative bi-modal morphing outer wing flap to be installed on the next generation open rotor green regional aircraft.

In order to prove structural load-carrying capabilities with the reference to a relevant environment, the full-scale morphing flap was properly analyzed by means of detailed finite element model analysis. To the authors' knowledge, there is no morphing concept in literature based on a similar architecture based on distributed servo-mechanical actuators.

The reference device is a regional aircraft single slotted flap, enhanced with deforming capabilities to obtain improved hyper-lift performance. The design {{started with the}} identification of the internal architecture, intended to allow camber variations. A concentrated-hinge architecture was selected, for its ability to fit different curvatures and for the possibility of easily realizing an “armadillo-like” configuration, then avoiding the use of a complicate deformable skin. The flap layout is made of segmented ribs, elastically hinged each other and span-wise connected by conventional spars. Relative rotations of the rib elements are forced by SMA structural actuators, i. e., cooperating in the external loads absorption. Super-elastic SMA are used to make up recovery elastic elements, necessary to regain the original shape after activation. These further elements in turn contribute to the overall flap rigidity.
