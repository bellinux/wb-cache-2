5000|$|In {{the first}} year of growth, plants form clumps of round shaped, {{slightly}} wrinkled leaves, that when crushed smell like garlic. The next year plants flower in spring, producing cross shaped white flowers in dense clusters. As the flowering stems bloom they elongate into a spike-like shape. When blooming is complete, plants produce upright fruits that release seeds in mid-summer. Plants are often found growing along the margins of hedges, giving rise to the old British folk name of <b>Jack-by-the-hedge.</b> Other common names include Garlic Mustard, Garlic Root, Hedge Garlic, Sauce-alone, Jack-in-the-bush, Penny Hedge and Poor Man's Mustard. The genus name Alliaria, [...] "resembling Allium", refers to the garlic-like odour of the crushed foliage.Some people give the species name Alliaria officinalis for this plant.|$|E
