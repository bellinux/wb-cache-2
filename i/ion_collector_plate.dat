40|$|The {{performance}} of a 2 cm miniature ion thruster was analyzed. A thruster of this size was predicted to produce a thrust of 200 μN. The plasma density was measured against rf input power and propellant flow rate for three configurations: the ICP source by itself; the ICP source with discharge chamber; and finally, the ICP source, the discharge chamber, and the permanent magnet cusp system. Once the optimum case was determined, electrostatic grids were added and thrust measurements were taken {{with a set of}} segmented <b>ion</b> <b>collector</b> <b>plates.</b> The miniature rf ion thruster obtained a thrust of 22. 35 μN and a specific impulse of 15. 31 s at its optimum operating condition of 5 W of rf power and and propellant flow rate of 5 sccm. With a beam divergence angle of 26. 25 degrees and the assumption of a singly charged ion species, the total thrust correction factor was 0. 90. The mass utilization efficiency of the thruster was calculated to be 0. 24 %. The electrical efficiency of thruster was calculated to be 16. 94 % with an electron-ion energy pair cost of 5. 9 keV/ion.

In the last two decades dwindling reserves of freely accessible water at the surface and subsurface environment have raised community awareness about the need to ensure that industrial production operates in a sustainable way that won’t constrain the development and sustainability of regional cities and towns that draw on downstream ground waters for their potable and non potable water requirements. In this paper, a method of augmenting the widely practiced evaporation pond approach is investigated for disposing of brine wastewaters to improve the sustainability of industrial operators employing this practice. The approach involves the adoption of solar <b>plate</b> <b>collector</b> technology. The solar technology referred to as unglazed transpired collectors (UTCs). It may be considered a hybrid concept as it’s a UTC except inclined like a typical solar <b>collector</b> <b>plate.</b> A pilot scale <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> unit was designed and constructed to evaluate the enhanced evaporation capabilities of a <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> unit (UTCs). The experimental program covered a 14 month study period from June 2005 to August, 2006. This research investigated the ability to enhance evaporation using three different brine concentrations (3. 5 % NaCl, 7. 0 % NaCl and 12. 5 % NaCl), and three film heights (0. 15 mm, 0. 2 mm and 0. 3 mm) over a 14 month experimental period between June 2005 and August 2006. The research investigated the relationship between key weather parameters, solar irradiation (MJ/m 2 /d), wind speed (m/s), ambient air temperature (°C), and relative humidity (%), and enhanced evaporation and <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> evaporation from the <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> unit. Data analysis found weather conditions low in relative humidity (less than 40 %), high in total incident solar radiation (greater than 20 MJ/m 2 /d), steady, constant wind speeds (between 1. 1 and 1. 3 m/s), and high daily average air temperatures (greater than 25 °C) would generally produce evaporation enhancement ratio (EER) results between 2. 0 and 3. 0 for brine solutions with concentrations up to 7. 0 % NaCl. The peak EER result of 3. 01 (achieved during summer) equated to the <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> unit achieving a rate of evaporation 301 % higher than an equivalent surface area of evaporation pond containing similar brine wastewater and subject to similar weather conditions. The mean EER result over the 14 month sampling period was 1. 52.

The fibers are formed on the <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> due to the high potential electric field applied at the tip of needle which causes stretching of the polymer melt, in a spiral pathway and gets deposited on the <b>collector</b> <b>plate.</b> In conventional <b>plate</b> <b>collector</b> set-up, random nanofibers are deposited. However, aligned nanofibers are proved to be more useful for various specific purposes and difficult to obtain. Aligned nanofibres have found uses in skeletal tissue regeneration, neural cell seeding in scaffold, fuel cell electrolytes, electrochemical sensing, bone and blood vessel engineering, composite metal reinforcement and many other applications. The aim of this work is to alter the collector set-up designs to change the morphology of fibers obtained on the <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> in an attempt to obtain aligned nanofibers. Briefly, ten different cost effective collector set-ups were fabricated. Electrospinning was performed using those <b>collector</b> <b>plates</b> and a polymer solution of Chloroform, Dichloromethane and Dimethyl formamide in 3 : 1 ratio was used. Other processing parameters such as applied voltage (12 kV), feed rate (1 mL/hr), tip collector distance (12 cm) were also optimized. The fibers obtained using the various collector setups were analysed using optical microscope and SEM. It was found that the alignment of the fibers obtained from the various collector set-ups varied with respect to each other. Best results were observed in case of grid shaped collector where the nanofibers were seen to be highly aligned. Alignment to a certain extent was also observed in case of static parallel electrodes collector set-up (ferrite magnetic strips) and in case of boat shaped collector for a small time period.

40|$|In this thesis, {{variations}} in efficiency between two different solar collectors have been measured. Solar collector efficiency has been measured {{at different levels}} of flow. In addition, there has been made calculations of heat gained by the solar system {{in the course of a}} day. The effect of reduced transmission at an increasing angle of incidence, has been discussed. Comparisons of the two models show a minor improvement in efficiency in the latest solar collector models. Comparing daily energy gain for the system show the similar result. The difference is seen most clearly when considering efficiency per. A solar heating system consists of a solar collector, a heat store and a heat distribution system. The system examined in this thesis, has water as a heat carrier medium, and a pump that circulates the water through the solar collectors. The essential elements of a solar collector are the <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> which can transfer energy from the sun to the water, and a cover sheet. The latter’s function is to prevent heat loss from the <b>collector</b> <b>plate,</b> and as such it makes the solar collectors function as a green house. Efficiency is an indicator of how well the solar collector, eventually the entire system, manages to exploit solar energy. In the thesis, efficiency has been analysed using a calorimetric method. Here the large storage tank holding almost 500 litres is used as a calorimeter. An easy way of measuring efficiency is looking at the increase in temperature in the heat store, and total radiation in the course of one day. Studies of the new solar collectors show that as much as 50 % of the energy received by the solar collectors in the course of a day is useful energy. The flow rate tells us how fast the water flows through the <b>collector</b> <b>plates.</b> The water absorbes energy from the <b>collector</b> <b>plates,</b> which are heated by the sun. In the experiments, three types of flow were chosen manually. The flow rates were between 0. 85 and 2. 0.
