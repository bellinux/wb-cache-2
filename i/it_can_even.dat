Barium is suitable for this purpose because of its low vapor pressure and reactivity towards oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water; <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> partly remove noble gases by dissolving them in the crystal lattice. This application is gradually disappearing due to the rising popularity of the tubeless LCD and plasma sets.|$|E
5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or {{sitting on top of}} wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that it is not a genetic ability and thus is very rare, the Rinnegan has been {{regarded}} as a legend with only the Sage of Six Paths known to acquire it. However, the reincarnations of Hagoromo's sons, Indra and Asura, can potentially access Rinnegan by having the genes of both reincarnations, as in the case of Madara (Indra's reincarnation), who obtained the DNA of Hashirama (Asura's reincarnation), although he only awoke the Rinnegan near the end of his natural lifespan. This is considered a wrongful act by Hagoromo as he attempted to leave a message in the form of a stone tablet for Indra's descendants to reconsider the act. The Rinnegan is shown to be transplantable, as Madara was able to implant his Rinnegan into the young Nagato, and Obito takes up Madara's left Rinnegan to use it in conjunction with his Sharingan. After meeting with Hagoromo, Sasuke, who is the current reincarnation of Indra, awakens a Rinnegan in his left eye, which has an additional six tomoe on top of the ripple pattern, making it closer to the Rinne Sharingan in appearance. His Rinnegan allows him to perform , which can shift himself, others, and objects a set distance away from his original location. He can increase the range of this technique by instantaneously changing place with a remote space. Due to its speed, this technique has proven to be especially useful for launching surprise attacks against enemies within its range. While there is no prerequisite for using the technique, it does have a recharging period after each use. Once fully mastered <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> cross dimensions but requires a large amount of chakra and drains his dōjutsu of its power for an extended period of time.|$|E

25|$|First, {{a pattern}} {{is made from}} {{polystyrene}} foam, which {{can be done by}} many different ways. For small volume runs the pattern can be hand cut or machined from a solid block of foam; if the geometry is simple enough <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> be cut using a hot-wire foam cutter. If the volume is large, then the pattern can be mass-produced by a process similar to injection molding. Pre-expanded beads of polystyrene are injected into a preheated aluminum mold at low pressure. Steam is then applied to the polystyrene which causes it to expand more to fill the die. The final pattern is approximately 97.5% air and 2.5% polystyrene. Pre-made pouring basins, runners, and risers can be hot glued to the pattern to finish it.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the oldest}} front vise design is the leg vise. It's called a leg vise {{because one of}} the bench's legs is an {{integral}} part of it - usually forming the inside jaw. The outside jaw also goes all the way to the floor - or nearly so. There is a single screw mounted between a quarter and a third of the way down that goes through both jaws with the nut on the back of the leg. Finally, there is some sort of horizontal beam at the bottom to act as a fulcrum. This beam may take the form of a board that can be adjusted by means of holes and pegs, or <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> be another screw. The leg vise is probably the simplest and least expensive of the front vises, and it is very strong.|$|E
25|$|Read on its own, the First Meditation {{can be seen}} as {{presenting}} skeptical doubts as {{a subject}} of study in their own right. Certainly, skepticism is a much discussed and hotly debated topic in philosophy, even today. Descartes raised the mystifying question of how we can claim to know with certainty anything about the world around us. The idea is not that these doubts are probable, but that their possibility can never be entirely ruled out. And if we can never be certain, how can we claim to know anything? Skepticism cuts straight {{to the heart of the}} Western philosophical enterprise and its attempt to provide a certain foundation for our knowledge and understanding of the world. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> be pushed so far as to be read as a challenge to our very notion of rationality.|$|E

25|$|Commercial egg substitutes, such as Bob's Red Mill egg {{replacer}} and Ener-G egg replacer, {{are available}} for cooking and baking. The protein in eggs thickens when heated and binds other ingredients together. Flaxseeds will do the same: replace each egg with one tablespoon of flaxseed meal mixed with three tablespoons of water. For pancakes a tablespoon of baking powder can be used instead of eggs. Other ingredients include (to replace one egg): one tablespoon of soy flour and one tablespoon of water; a quarter cup of mashed bananas, mashed prunes or apple sauce; or in batter two tablespoons of white flour, half a tablespoon of vegetable oil, two tablespoons of water, and half a tablespoon of baking powder. Silken (soft) tofu and mashed potato can also be used. Recently, aquafaba has come into use as a popular egg replacement, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> be whipped up like egg whites.|$|E
25|$|In , a {{different}} {{version of the}} Batmobile retains its classic-shape and designs; but is heavily influenced by The Dark Knight Trilogy Tumbler. The car is heavier than a tank, its ability to absorb impact makes it nearly indestructible, and affected anything it collided with in similar fashion. It can be called to Batman instantly with the press of a button and can eject Batman hundreds of {{feet in the air}} to instantly begin gliding. Batman can also control the Batmobile remotely using his Batmobile Remote gadget and <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> support Batman while he is fighting free flow combat via a Batmobile assisted Special Takedown. Like the Batsuit and gadgets, the Batmobile can be upgraded and even has its own alternate skins (such as one based on the Batmobile from 1960 TV series). The game also features Batmobiles from the 1960 TV Series and the films appear as DLC and are used in special Racing AR Challenges.|$|E
25|$|During glaciation, {{water was}} taken from the oceans to form the ice at high latitudes, thus global sea level dropped by about 110 meters, exposing the {{continental}} shelves and forming land-bridges between land-masses for animals to migrate. During deglaciation, the melted ice-water returned to the oceans, causing sea level to rise. This process can cause sudden shifts in coastlines and hydration systems resulting in newly submerged lands, emerging lands, collapsed ice dams resulting in salination of lakes, new ice dams creating vast areas of freshwater, and a general alteration in regional weather patterns on a large but temporary scale. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> cause temporary reglaciation. This type of chaotic pattern of rapidly changing land, ice, saltwater and freshwater has been proposed as the likely model for the Baltic and Scandinavian regions, as well as much of central North America {{at the end of the}} last glacial maximum, with the present-day coastlines only being achieved in the last few millennia of prehistory. Also, the effect of elevation on Scandinavia submerged a vast continental plain that had existed under much of what is now the North Sea, connecting the British Isles to Continental Europe.|$|E

25|$|Lucario is a canid-like Pokémon {{that is a}} bipedal digitigrade with finger-like digits on its forepaws, {{while its}} chest and the {{exterior}} of its wrists each feature a single, white spike. It also has a large snout and ears, red irises with vertical slit pupils, thighs shaped like baggy shorts, and four small appendages {{on the back of}} its head that are used to sense Aura. The coloration of Lucario's fur is predominantly blue and black, although its torso features buff-colored fur that is slightly shaggier than the rest of its body. Lucario has the ability to sense and manipulate , a form of energy emitted by all living things, and is able to understand human speech. As a result, Lucario can read the thoughts and movements of other beings by sensing the Aura that they emit, to the point that <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> see otherwise invisible foes. When properly trained, it can identify the feelings of others even if they are over half a mile away. Lucario has a pre-evolution called Riolu, a baby Pokémon that is also able to sense Aura. Compared to Lucario, Riolu is a pure Fighting-type Pokémon, rather than a Fighting/Steel-type Pokémon, and it cannot manipulate Aura as capably as Lucario.|$|E
25|$|The {{wild boar}} inhabits a {{diverse array of}} {{habitats}} from boreal taigas to deserts. In mountainous regions, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> occupy alpine zones, occurring up to 1,900 metres in the Carpathians, 2,600 metres in the Caucasus and up to 3,600–4,000 metres in the mountains in Central Asia and Kazakhstan. In order {{to survive in a}} given area, wild boars require a habitat fulfilling three conditions: heavily brushed areas providing shelter from predators, water for drinking and bathing purposes and an absence of regular snowfall. The main habitats favoured by boars in Europe are deciduous and mixed forests, with the most favourable areas consisting of forest composed of oak and beech enclosing marshes and meadows. In the Białowieża Forest, the animal's primary habitat consists of well developed, broad-leaved and mixed forests, along with marshy mixed forests, with coniferous forests and undergrowths being of secondary importance. Forests made up entirely of oak groves and beech are used only during the fruit-bearing season. This is in contrast to the Caucasian and Transcaucasian mountain areas, where boars will occupy such fruit-bearing forests year-round. In the mountainous areas of the Russian Far East, the species inhabits nutpine groves, hilly mixed forests where Mongolian oak and Korean pine are present, swampy mixed taiga and coastal oak forests. In Transbaikalia, boars are restricted to river valleys with nutpine and shrubs. Boars are regularly encountered in pistachio groves in winter in some areas of Tajikistan and Turkmenia, while in spring they migrate to open deserts; boar have also colonised deserts in several areas they have been introduced to. On the islands of Komodo and Rinca, the boar mostly inhabits savanna or open monsoon forests, avoiding heavily forested areas unless pursued by humans. Wild boar are known to be competent swimmers, capable of covering long distances. In 2013, one boar was reported to have completed the seven mile swim from France to Alderney in the Channel Islands. Due to concerns about disease it was shot and incinerated.|$|E
