40|$|Increased CO 2 -concentrations {{within the}} {{atmosphere}} of the Earth have encouraged development of “carbon capture and storage” (CCS). It is important to avoid global warming, and CO 2 may be stored within geological formations in the subsurface. This thesis focuses on the possibilities of storing CO 2 in a reservoir of Middle Triassic-Middle Jurassic age in The Nordkapp Basin, The Southern Barents Sea. The thesis tries to map out the extent of a reservoir and a cap rock, calculate the amount of injectable CO 2, and assess the potential risks of leakage for the CO 2 -storage complex. The evaluation is based on a migrated 3 D-seismic dataset, ST 9403, with 7228 / 7 - 1 A as a reference well. The well penetrates several formations, where the formations of Stø-Tubåen are considered the best reservoir unit, consisting of a homogenous sandstone with good properties. The cap rock constitutes the formations of Hekkingen and Fuglen, which is tight, covering and homogenous. The trap type is linked to extensive salt domes, enclosed by faulted structures. The salt domes are stable and the faults inactive and tight. Possible <b>hazardous,</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> between the salt, the injected CO 2 and a Permian carbonate are considered the largest safety risks for the CO 2 -storage complex...|$|R
40|$|Some of Hanford`s {{underground}} {{waste storage}} tanks contain Organic- bearing high level wastes that are high priority safety issues because of potentially <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> of organics with inorganic oxidants in these wastes such as nitrates and nitrites. To ensure continued safe storage of these wastes, Westinghouse Hanford Company has placed affected tanks on the Organic Watch List and manages them under special rules. Because water content {{has been identified}} as the most efficient agent for preventing a propagating reaction and {{is an integral part of}} the criteria developed to ensure continued safe storage of Hanford`s organic-bearing radioactive tank wastes, as part of the Organic Tank Safety Program the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory developed and demonstrated a simple and easily implemented procedure to determine the equilibrium water content of these potentially reactive wastes exposed to the range of water vapor pressures that might be experienced during the wastes` future storage. This work focused on the equilibrium water content and did not investigate the various factors such as @ ventilation, tank surface area, and waste porosity that control the rate that the waste would come into equilibrium, with either the average Hanford water partial pressure 5. 5 torr or other possible water partial pressures...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{leads to}} {{sustainability}} (responsible {{management of resources}} consumption) of both paper and sugar industries. It, simultaneously, upgrades recycled waste paper (namely old newsprint) and creates a new use for molasses (an important byproduct of the sugar industry). This study introduces -for the first time world wide- a novel environmentally safe approach to upgrade recycled natural cellulose fibers (waste paper namely old newsprint), for use as specialty paper green nanocomposites suitable for several advanced purposes. The recycled cellulose fibers are upgraded by increasing their alpha cellulose content, and restoring their natural nanoporous structure, which is -normally- collapsed due to the first cycle of papermaking. Molasses is then incorporated into this restored nanoporous structure to obtain paper green nanocomposites filled with kaolin in presence of molasses. In comparison to conventionally recycled waste paper, the green paper nanocomposites -produced in this work- exhibit high dry and wet strength, and a surprisingly tremendous retention of inorganic fillers used in papermaking. This was achieved through a green nanotechnology process, where the solvent used is water (the ideal green solvent). The input and output components are renewable environmentally safe materials i. e. waste paper (cellulose fibers) and molasses (a by product of the sugar industry). The procedures used are simple physical processes conducted at room temperature rather than <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions.</b> Thus, saving energy, and decreasing the risk of chemical and thermal accidents, pollutive releases, explosions, and fires...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} growing {{interest}} in environmental forms of trace evidence, and ecological trace evidence collected from footwear has proved valuable within casework. Simultaneously, there has been growing awareness of the need for empirical experimentation to underpin forensic inferences. Diatoms are unicellular algae, and each cell (or ‘frustule’) consists of two valves which are made of silica, a robust material that favours their preservation both in sediments and within forensic scenarios. A series of experiments were carried out to investigate the transfer and persistence of diatoms upon common footwear materials, a recipient surface that has historically been overlooked by studies of persistence. The effectiveness of two novel extraction techniques (jet rinsing, and heating and agitation with distilled water) was compared to the established extraction technique of hydrogen peroxide digestion, for a suite of five common footwear materials: canvas, leather, and ‘suede’ (representing upper materials), and rubber and polyurethane (representing sole materials). It was observed that the novel extraction technique of heating and agitation with distilled water did not extract fewer diatom valves, or cause increased fragmentation of valves, when compared to peroxide digestion, suggesting that the method may be viable where potentially <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> may be encountered with the peroxide digestion method. Valves could be extracted from all five footwear materials after 3 min of immersion, and more valves were extracted from the rougher, woven upper materials than the smoother sole materials. Canvas yielded the most valves (a mean of 2511 /cm 2) and polyurethane the fewest (a mean of 15 /cm 2). The persistence of diatoms on the three upper materials was addressed with a preliminary pilot investigation, with ten intervals sampled between 0 and 168 h. Valves were seen to persist in detectable quantities after 168 h on all three upper materials. However, some samples produced slides with no valves, and the earliest time after which no diatom valves were found was 4 h after the transfer. Analysis of the particle size distributions over time, by image analysis, suggests that the retention of diatoms may be size-selective; after 168 h, no particles larger than 200 μm 2 could be found on the samples of canvas, and > 95...|$|R

30|$|The {{recovery}} of nanopalladium particles from waste {{has been of}} great interest recently [1]. Certain physical properties of nanopalladium particles {{differ from those of}} the bulk material [2],[3]. Palladium is used extensively because of its catalytic activity in some <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions.</b> Traditionally, the preparation of nanopalladium requires the rigorous experimental procedures. In contrast, the microbiological biosynthetic process of converting Pd(II) to Pd(0) works through the binding of metal Pd(II) ions onto highly reactive bacterial cell surfaces concomitant with Pd(II) ion reduction [4] at ambient temperature and pressure. This process does not require <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemicals</b> and, thus, is effective and environmentally friendly.|$|R
40|$|Advances in MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) {{have enabled}} {{some of the}} "Lab-on-a-Chip" {{technologies}} and microfluidics that are pervasive {{in many of the}} current developments in analytical chemistry and molecular biology. Coinciding with this effort in micro-analytics has been research in chemical process miniaturization [...] reducing the characteristic length scale of the unit operation to improve heat and mass transfer, and ultimately process performance. My research has involved the design and fabrication of novel <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> systems using MEMS and microfabrication methods (photolithography, deep-reactive-ion etching, thin-film growth and deposition, and multiple wafer bonding). Miniature chemical systems provide the opportunity for distributed, on-demand manufacturing, which would eliminate the hazards of transportation and storage of toxic or <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> intermediates. <b>Reactions</b> that are particularly suitable for miniaturized chemical systems are those that are fast and involve toxic intermediates: the controlled synthesis of phosgene is such a reaction and has been demonstrated in a microfabricated packed bed reactor. Owing to the high surface-to-volume ratios, micro chemical systems also have the potential to make improvements in process performance through enhanced heat and mass transfer. (cont.) Heterogeneously catalyzed gas-liquid reactions have been performed in the microfabricated reactors and have been shown to have mass transfer coefficients several orders of magnitude larger than their industrial-scale counterparts. Multiphase reactions are often hindered by mass-transfer limitations owing to the difficulty in transporting the gaseous reactant through the liquid to the catalytic surface. The microchemical device has been designed to increase the interfacial gas-liquid contacting area by promoting dispersion and preventing coalescence. Microfabrication allows the design of reactors with complicated fluidic distribution networks, staggered arrays of microstructural features to promote mixing, and the integration of sensing and temperature control. Other uses of microfabrication include the incorporation of porous silicon as a high surface area catalyst support. In all, performing multiphase chemistry on a chip has been demonstrated to have inherent advantages, particularly for those fast reactions that can benefit from improved mixing and mass transfer. by Matthew W.

Monopropellant motors tend to have high thrust while remaining comparatively simple, which also provides high reliability.
