5|$|After Jacob's death, the Monster tells Ben {{to fetch}} Richard, {{as he wants}} to speak to him. However, when Ben exits the statue, Richard throws him down beside the corpse of the real John Locke, which has {{been brought to the}} statue by {{survivors}} of the Ajira flight, led by Ilana Verdansky (Zuleikha Robinson). Ben is forced by Ilana's group to bring them to the imposter Locke. They start shooting at the Monster, but he disappears, then returns in its black smoke form, killing Ilana's group. The Monster returns to Locke's form and mockingly informs Ben of the real Locke's last thoughts, while being strangled by Ben. Afterwards, Ben comforts Ilana when he finds <b>her</b> <b>crying</b> in Jacob's chamber and sets off with her, Sun, and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) to bury Locke before going to the Temple, where they believe they will be safe from the Monster. At Locke's funeral, Ben provides the eulogy, and expresses his sincere apologies for killing Locke. When they arrive at the Temple, the Monster is destroying the place. They return to the beach as a temporary shelter, and Ben attempts to make amends with everyone for killing Jacob. Ilana then forces him to dig a grave and explains she will kill Ben for murdering her father figure. Later, the Monster visits Ben, telling him to join him and then magically frees Ben. After Ben escapes, Ilana chases after him, and the two come face-to-face at the jungle when Ben points a rifle at her. Ben explains to her why he really killed Jacob, particularly grieving his daughter. Ilana understands and allows him to rejoin their group, which he does. Hurley, Jack, and Richard show up and join their group, then have a meeting, deciding what to do next. Richard suggests they should stop the Monster escaping by blowing up the Ajira plane. After Hurley destroys the available dynamite from the shipwrecked Black Rock, Richard insists he will find other explosives. Ben and Miles join Richard, while the rest decide to go talk to the Monster. When Ben, Richard and Miles arrive at the Barracks, Widmore is there, and is soon joined by the Monster. Ben murders Widmore before he is able to make a deal with the Monster to spare his daughter. The Monster and Ben find Desmond and the Monster forces him to go destroy the Island. They run into Jack's group and they both go {{to the heart of the}} Island, where Desmond removes the cork of the Island, causing the Island to begin collapsing. After Jack kills the Monster, Ben and Hurley volunteer to stay behind on the Island with Jack to assist him relighting the Island. Jack tells them he will die doing this and Jack gives Hurley the new position of being protector of the Island. Ben advises him to approach his Island duties with his kindness and helpful attitude. Hurley asks Ben to become his advisor, to which he is honored. After an undisclosed period of time, Ben, on orders from Hurley, arrives at the Dharma Logistics Warehouse in Guam. He speaks to the two workers there and instructs them that the facility is being shut down. Afterward, Ben arrives at the Santa Rosa Mental Hospital and visits Walt. Ben tells him that he is still special and that he can help his father, Michael, even though he is dead, and offers Walt a job to return to the island.|$|E

Bart, as Woodrow, writes Edna other letters, using dialogue from old romance films {{to tell her what}} she wants to hear. He then sends a letter asking for them to meet at the Gilded Truffle restaurant. Bart sees Edna waiting for Woodrow, and laughs as he goes to watch a movie. When he comes back and sees Edna still at the restaurant on the verge of tears, Bart is upset and guilty to see <b>her</b> <b>crying.</b> Meanwhile, Homer resists temptations to curse but nevertheless experiences intense feelings of rage.

500|$|Marceline and her father, Hunson Abadeer, {{have trouble}} {{accepting}} one another. Initially, Marceline feels {{that her father}} does not care for her, and expresses her feelings through the before-mentioned [...] "Fry Song". Although they admit to loving each other, Abadeer constantly pressures Marceline {{to follow in the}} family business and take over ruling the Nightosphere, a prospective job Marceline does not want. Marceline and the Ice King also have a complicated relationship. In the episode [...] "I Remember You", it is revealed that the Ice King—then, the human man named Simon Petrikov—discovered <b>her</b> <b>crying</b> in the ruins of a city destroyed by the Mushroom Wars. It was Simon who gave little Marceline Hambo and attempted to watch over her. This kind gesture made the Ice King a long-time close friend and father figure to Marceline. However, as the crown's power increased, Simon began to forget more and more about his relationship with Marceline, until he had all but forgotten their friendship. Former storyboard artist and current supervising director for the series Adam Muto explained that Marceline and the Ice King's history {{was not part of the}} series' initial plan, but something that [...] "evolved from [...] original course and it will likely continue to evolve in the future." ...|$|E
500|$|Sonic {{manages to}} obtain the World Rings, and Erazor convinces Shahra to give them to him. To try {{to keep them out}} of Erazor's hands, Sonic wishes for Shahra to do what she truly thinks is right, and she collapses on the ground as her mind cracks due to her {{conflicting}} emotions. Erazor attempts to sacrifice Sonic in order to open the gateway between worlds, but in a move of altruistic suicide, Shahra interrupts the attack, saving Sonic and asking for his forgiveness before dying in his arms. Without Sonic as the proper offering, Erazor mutates into the monstrous Alf Layla wa-Layla, now intent on remaking the Arabian Nights in his image before moving on to Sonic's world. Sonic absorbs three of the World Rings and transforms into Darkspine Sonic, a darker, more violent version of Super Sonic, granting him the power to defeat Alf Layla wa-Layla, but Erazor subsequently boasts that he is immortal and will always return. Sonic then reveals that he possesses Erazor's lamp. Sonic then wishes for Erazor to bring Shahra back to life, restore the book to its original state, and be trapped in his lamp for all eternity. Erazor refuses to do so, but is helpless against the power of his lamp. After granting the third wish, Erazor pleads for Shahra to stop Sonic and save him, but she refuses, leaving him to be sucked into his lamp. Shahra then bursts into tears, and Sonic wishes for a mountain of handkerchiefs to help her through <b>her</b> <b>crying.</b> Sonic then disposes of the lamp in a pit of lava in a previously explored level. Sonic runs through the book until he finds a way home. Shahra states that his story will be forever remembered in the pages of the Arabian Nights, and the credits roll. An image of the title of [...] "Aladdin and the Magic Lamp" [...] in the book then changes to [...] "Sonic and the Secret Rings".|$|E

2500|$|Their {{relationship}} was severely tested when Chrissie {{made contact with}} Mark's father, Frank Williams. Robert Powell explained: [...] ""Chrissie finds Mark's father for him {{but he has not}} spoken to his father for some time since they had a major falling out. What she does not know is that the issues between Mark and his father are nothing compared to the issues between Mark's father and Tricia, his daughter-in-law." [...] Indeed, Tricia was extremely pensive about the reunion, even more so when Frank was taken ill and admitted to the hospital. Sharon Maughan expanded on the storyline: [...] "Tricia's horrified when Lisa tells her that Frank had a suspected stroke in the night and was rambling on about Chrissie being his daughter. At first, Tricia claims that Frank doesn't know what he is talking about because he is ill. But later, when Lisa finds <b>her</b> <b>crying,</b> she breaks down and reveals that Frank raped her when she was a teenager, during the time she was married to Mark." [...] Tricia had Frank take a secret paternity test, confirming that he was indeed Chrissie's biological father. [...] As his condition deteriorated, she lied, claiming that he had expressed an instruction that he did not wish to be resuscitated. Frank died, and Tricia hoped that Chrissie's true paternity could remain a secret.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Helbo quoted Rabbi Jonathan {{to teach}} that the firstborn {{should have come}} from Rachel, as [...] says, [...] "These are the generations of Jacob, Joseph," [...] but Leah prayed for mercy before Rachel did. On account of Rachel's modesty, however, God {{restored}} {{the rights of the}} firstborn to Rachel's son Joseph from Leah's son Reuben. To teach what caused Leah to anticipate Rachel with her prayer for mercy, Rav taught that Leah's eyes were sore (as [...] reports) from <b>her</b> <b>crying</b> about what she heard at the crossroads. There she heard people saying: [...] "Rebecca has two sons, and Laban has two daughters; the elder daughter should marry the elder son, and the younger daughter should marry the younger son." [...] Leah inquired about the elder son, and the people said that he was a wicked man, a highway robber. And Leah asked about the younger son, and the people said that he was [...] "a quiet man dwelling in tents." [...] So she cried about her fate until her eyelashes fell out. This accounts for the words of [...] "And the Lord saw that Leah was hated, and He opened her womb," [...] which mean not that Leah was actually hated, but rather that God saw that Esau's conduct was hateful to Leah, so he rewarded her prayer for mercy by opening her womb first..|$|E
2500|$|After six {{generations of}} gods, in the Babylonian Enûma Eliš, {{in the seventh}} generation, (Akkadian [...] "shapattu" [...] or sabath), the younger Igigi gods, {{the sons and daughters}} of Enlil and Ninlil, go on strike and refuse their duties of keeping the {{creation}} working. Abzu God of fresh water, co-creator of the cosmos, threatens to destroy the world with his waters, and the Gods gather in terror. Enki promises to help and puts Abzu to sleep, confining him in irrigation canals and places him in the Kur, beneath his city of Eridu. But the universe is still threatened, as Tiamat, angry at the imprisonment of Abzu and at the prompting of her son and vizier Kingu, decides to take back the creation herself. The gods gather again in terror and turn to Enki for help, but Enki who harnessed Abzu, Tiamat's consort, for irrigation refuses to get involved. The gods then seek help elsewhere, and the patriarchal Enlil, their father, God of Nippur, promises to solve the problem if they make him King of the Gods. In the Babylonian tale, Enlil's role is taken by Marduk, Enki's son, and in the Assyrian version it is Asshur. After dispatching Tiamat with the [...] "arrows of his winds" [...] down her throat and constructing the heavens with the arch of her ribs, Enlil places her tail in the sky as the Milky Way, and <b>her</b> <b>crying</b> eyes become the source of the Tigris and Euphrates. But there is still the problem of [...] "who will keep the cosmos working". Enki, who might have otherwise come to their aid, is lying in a deep sleep and fails to hear their cries.
