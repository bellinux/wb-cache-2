25|$|Although {{attacking the}} U.S. Pacific Fleet anchor would achieve surprise, it also carried two {{distinct}} disadvantages. The targeted ships would be sunk or damaged in very shallow water, meaning <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> {{likely that they}} could be salvaged and possibly returned to duty (as six of the eight battleships eventually were). Also, most of the crews would survive the attack, since many would be on shore leave or would be rescued from the harbor afterward. Despite these concerns, Yamamoto and Genda pressed ahead.|$|E
25|$|In practice, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> {{difficult}} to physiologically measure an individual's three cone responses to various physical color stimuli. Instead, a psychophysical approach is taken. Three specific benchmark test lights are typically used; let us call them S, M, and L. To calibrate human perceptual space, scientists allowed human subjects {{to try to}} match any physical color by turning dials to create specific combinations of intensities (I'S, I'M, I'L) for the S, M, and L lights, resp., until a match was found. This needed only {{to be done for}} physical colors that are spectral, since a linear combination of spectral colors will be matched by the same linear combination of their (I'S, I'M, I'L) matches. Note that in practice, often at least one of S, M, L would have to be added with some intensity to the physical test color, and that combination matched by a linear combination of the remaining 2 lights. Across different individuals (without color blindness), the matchings turned out to be nearly identical.|$|E
25|$|That same year, the Aquileian War of Succession erupted as a {{coalition}} of secular nobles from Udine and surrounding cities sought to remove the newly appointed Patriarch, Philippe II d'Alençon. Fiore seems to have sided with the secular nobility against the Cardinal as in 1383 there is record of him being tasked by the grand council with inspection and maintenance on the artillery pieces defending Udine (including large crossbows and catapults). There are also records of him working variously as a magistrate, peace officer, and agent of the grand council {{during the course of}} 1384, but after that the historical record is silent. The war continued until a new Patriarch was appointed in 1389 and a peace settlement was reached, but it's unclear if Fiore remained involved for the duration. Given that he appears in council records five times in 1384, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> odd for him to be completely unmentioned over the subsequent five years, and since his absence after May 1384 coincides with a proclamation in July of that year demanding that Udine cease hostilities or face harsh repercussions, it seems more likely that he moved on.|$|E

500|$|The new {{government}} did not sue for peace, and by 17 September, the Prussian armies had surrounded Paris. Unlike Gounod, who fled to England, Bizet rejected opportunities to leave the besieged city: [...] "I can't leave Paris! It's impossible! <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> simply an act of cowardice", he wrote to Mme Halévy. Life in the city became frugal and harsh, although, by October, there were efforts to re-establish normality. Pasdeloup resumed his regular Sunday concerts, and on 5 November, the Opéra reopened with excerpts from works by Gluck, Rossini, and Meyerbeer.|$|E
500|$|In 1878 and 1879 Stanford {{worked on}} his first opera, The Veiled Prophet, to a {{libretto}} by his friend William Barclay Squire. It {{was based on a}} poem by Thomas Moore with characters including a virgin priestess and a mystic prophet, and a plot that culminates in poisoning and stabbing. Stanford offered the work to the opera impresario Carl Rosa, who refused it and suggested that the composer should try to have it staged in Germany: [...] "Its success will (unfortunately) have much greater chances here if accepted abroad." [...] Referring to the enormous popularity of Sullivan's comic operas, Rosa added, [...] "If the work was of the Pinafore style <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> another matter." [...] Stanford had greatly enjoyed Sullivan's Cox and Box, but The Veiled Prophet was intended to be a serious work of high drama and romance.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of several years, Grant's {{political}} opinions shifted from libertarian socialism to free market-based philosophies. Alan Grant commented on the philosophical pattern the character's transformation took for a 1997 interview: [...] "Although I haven’t read them in chronological order I would think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> easy to see the parallel between Anarky’s thought processes and my own thought processes." [...] By 1997 he had settled on the philosophy of Neo-Tech, a philosophy developed by Frank R. Wallace. At approximately the same time he was when given the opportunity to write an Anarky mini-series, and so decided to revamp the character accordingly. Grant laid out his reasoning in an interview just before the first issue's publication. [...] "I felt he was the perfect character" [...] to express Neo-Tech philosophy, Grant explained, [...] "because he's human, he has no special powers, the only power he's got is the power of his own rational consciousness". This new characterization was later carried on in the 1999 Anarky ongoing series.|$|E

500|$|The Times {{described}} the ceremony as [...] "a masterpiece", with The Daily Telegraph {{saying it was}} [...] "brilliant, breathtaking, bonkers and utterly British". The BBC's chief sports writer Tom Fordyce called it [...] "eccentric" [...] and [...] "tongue-in-cheek", saying [...] "no-one expected ... <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> so gloriously daft, so cynicism-squashingly charming and, well, so much pinch-yourself fun." [...] Two weeks after the ceremony Jonathan Freedland of The Guardian wrote that [...] "Boyle's spectacular, so beautifully executed and ingeniously conceived it lingers in the mind even as the closing draws near, stood apart from its predecessors thanks not only to its humour and eccentricity, {{but also because it}} had something to say." [...] Writing in The Observer, Jackie Kay commented that [...] "it seemed that Boyle had invented a new kind of opening ceremony, a concept ceremony, one that embraces big ideas as passionately as it does technical flamboyancy". The Stage said that [...] "Danny Boyle's spectacular and moving Olympics Opening Ceremony was undoubtedly the theatrical highlight of 2012".|$|E
500|$|A {{second set}} of dies was {{produced}} with the relief reduced somewhat, but still proved too high relief for practical coining, requiring three strokes of the press to fully bring out the design. [...] Saint-Gaudens had produced the models for these dies under the misapprehension that the first pieces had been struck on a production press, {{rather than on the}} Mint's only medal press, and therefore only slight adjustment need be made. When Saint-Gaudens died on , 1907, Hering was working on a third model. [...] Uncertain where to find Hering, Roosevelt ordered the new Secretary of the Treasury, George Cortelyou, to have the Mint finalize the design and put the coin in circulation by [...] [...] Barber was recalled from his vacation in Ocean Grove, New Jersey, to comply with the President's order. [...] Barber wrote Philadelphia Mint Superintendent John Landis on [...] that what Roosevelt wanted was impossible; he had no dies nor any clear idea of how Saint-Gaudens had planned to reduce the relief. [...] The Mint chief engraver alleged that he could take no action with respect to the double eagle. [...] On , Hering finally appeared at the Mint with a new set of models, which Barber again quickly rejected. [...] Barber wrote to Preston, [...] "Upon examination {{it was found that the}} relief of the models was so great that it would be a waste of time to make reductions for coinage, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> impossible to coin when the dies are made." [...] Instead, Barber began work on his own low relief version of Saint-Gaudens's design.|$|E
2500|$|Anthropologist Oscar {{plays the}} role of go-getting {{salesman}} to the hilt. [...] He is having trouble unloading some of his more expensive items, such as the brass-bound Yankee pie cupboard. [...] With no Yankees to speak of in the area, pies are not a common menu item. [...] However his real purpose is to gain entry to people's houses so he can record their lives. [...] Still, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> a coup to unload that cupboard.|$|E

2500|$|Opponents of the LDS Church {{found in}} {{polygamy}} a convenient cause célèbre. [...] Opposition to the church, especially among former Mormons, frequently focused, not upon the drawbacks of polygamy as a marriage system, but upon polygamy as {{a symptom of}} the depravity of Mormonism and Mormons in general. [...] Former LDS Church member and prominent critic Fanny Stenhouse wrote in 1875: <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> impossible, with any regard to propriety, to relate all the horrible results of this disgraceful system .... Marriages have been contracted between the nearest of relatives; and old men tottering on the brink of the grave have been united to little girls scarcely in their teens; while unnatural alliances of every description, which in any other community would be regarded with disgust and abhorrence, are here entered into in the name of God.|$|E
2500|$|More {{than thirty}} years after The Naked Civil Servant, Hurt reprised the role of Quentin Crisp in the 2009 film An Englishman in New York. This {{television}} film depicts Crisp's later years in New York. He returned to Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, playing the on-screen Big Brother for the Paper Zoo Theatre Company's stage adaptation of the novel in June 2009. The theatre production premiered at the National Media Museum, in Bradford and toured during 2010. Hurt said, [...] "I think Paper Zoo thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> ironic to have the person who played Winston having risen in the party. From the Chestnut Tree Cafe, he's managed to get his wits together again, now understanding that 2 and 2 make 5, and becomes Big Brother. So it tickled my fancy, and of course I looked up Paper Zoo, {{and they seem to}} me to be the sort of company that's essential in the country as we know it, and doing a lot of really good stuff." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{announced}} on 15 November 2009, that Benaud {{had signed a}} three-year contract with the Nine Network to continue being part of their cricket coverage until 2013, although his role would change from that of ball-by-ball commentary. Benaud said: [...] "I won't be doing live commentary any more." [...] Someone asked me, [...] "Does that mean you'll never again go into the commentary box?", [...] "Well, the answer to that", Benaud replied, [...] "If there is, as there always can be, some emergency or a sensational happening on or off the field where <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> ridiculous not {{to go into the}} commentary box, of course I'll be in there doing my job and doing it as professionally as I can. But I won't be on the live commentary roster. But I will be doing all sorts of, what I regard as, interesting things for Channel Nine on the cricket—special features on the cricket...". Richie commentated regularly during the 2011–12 season and was part of Nine's commentating team/roster.|$|E

3000|$|The {{proof of}} this result is {{analogous}} to the one of Theorem  1.
