5|$|Brubaker {{received}} {{calls from}} interested parties in Hollywood about adapting The Fade Out {{very early in}} its publication. However, {{he did not want}} to sell the rights until the series was finished. He <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> with a previous work, and it affected the way he wrote it because he was imagining it in the other medium.|$|E
5|$|Honoré III was {{succeeded by}} his son Honoré IV (1758–1819) whose {{marriage}} to Louise d'Aumont Mazarin <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> much to restore the Grimaldi fortunes. Much of this fortune had been depleted by the hardships of the revolution. On 17 June 1814 under the Treaty of Paris, the Principality of Monaco was restored to Honoré IV.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Crowley {{travelled}} to St Petersburg in Russia, later {{claiming that}} he was trying to learn Russian as he was considering a future diplomatic career there. Biographers Richard Spence and Tobias Churton suggested that Crowley <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> as an intelligence agent under the employ of the British secret service, speculating that he had been enlisted while at Cambridge.|$|E
25|$|The first question, then, {{was whether}} it had had an {{adequate}} opportunity to <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> {{regardless of whether it}} actually had. Soler claimed that it could not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> at the Supreme Court since the record was already fixed. Therefore, it argued, neither there nor on remand could it <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so.</b>|$|R

5|$|MacArthur {{expressed}} {{the hope that}} the Eighth Army could withdraw to Japan {{by the end of the}} year. When Bradley asked if a division could be sent to Europe, MacArthur replied that he could make one available in January. In fact, Chinese troops had already begun crossing the Yalu into North Korea, and by November 180,000 <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 15May 1930, barely {{two weeks}} after delivery, one of the Bulldogs crashed due to {{structural}} failure while performing an inverted loop; the pilot parachuted to safety, the first time an RAAF member <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> in an emergency. In September 1931, Fighter Squadron began flight testing the prototype Wackett Warrigal general-purpose biplane; testing was still under way when the aircraft's undercarriage collapsed during landing, putting off its service trials until the following January.|$|E
5|$|On June 12, 2003, NOAA {{published}} a forecast for the East Pacific hurricane season, {{the first time}} it <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>so.</b> The scientists predicted a 50% chance of below normal activity this season, due to the expectation that La Niña conditions would develop. La Niña conditions generally restrict tropical cyclone development in the northeast Pacific, which is the opposite of its effect in the Atlantic.|$|E

50|$|The Council {{has issued}} policy {{statements}} {{from time to}} time. on various issues.

5|$|Starting {{with the}} third edition, Darwin prefaced the {{introduction}} with a sketch of {{the historical development of}} evolutionary ideas. In that sketch he acknowledged that Patrick Matthew had, unknown to Wallace or himself, anticipated the concept of natural selection in an appendix to a book published in 1831; in the fourth edition he mentioned that William Charles Wells <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> as early as 1813.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 IIHF World Championship rosters {{consisted}} of 393 players on 16 national ice hockey teams. Run by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), the Ice Hockey World Championships is the sport's highest-profile annual international tournament. The 2007 IIHF World Championship was the 71st {{edition of the}} tournament and was held in Moscow and Mytischi, Russia.

5|$|The Church that Sigeberht <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> much to {{establish}} in East Anglia survived for two centuries, enduring 'evil times' (such as {{the period when}} the kingdom was under attack by the armies of Penda of Mercia). It lasted continuously under a succession of bishops until the Danish Great Heathen Army invaded East Anglia in the 860s.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} high schools using the Redskins {{name has been}} in steady decline, 40% having had local efforts to change the name. From 1988 until April 2013, 28 high schools in 18 states <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>so,</b> 62 schools using the name at that time. Since that list was compiled, other high school teams have dropped the name, {{including}} four affected by a 2015 California law.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{also had}} an {{economic}} impact. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and American Stock Exchange (AMEX) closed {{as a result of}} the storm. It was the first time in history that the NYSE closed for a full day due to the weather, and the first time since 1918 that AMEX <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>so.</b> All commodity exchanges in New York City and the National Association of Securities Dealers also closed.|$|E

Armagh were the {{defending}} champions, having won their first title the year previously. They {{had lost the}} final in 1953 and 1977. No side had won consecutive titles since Cork in 1989 and 1990, while no side from Ulster <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> since Down, who won in 1960 and 1961.|$|E

5|$|Bayliss's counsel, Rufus Isaacs, called Starling as {{his first}} witness. Starling {{admitted}} that he had broken the law by using the dog twice, but said that he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> to avoid sacrificing two dogs. Bayliss testified that the dog had been given one-and-a-half grains of morphia earlier in the day, then six ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether, delivered from an ante room to a tube connected to the dog's trachea. Bayliss said the tubes were fragile, and that had the dog been struggling they would have broken.|$|E

5|$|By 1849, {{many of the}} Latter-day Saints who {{remained}} in Iowa or Missouri were poor and unable to afford {{the costs of the}} wagon, teams of oxen, and supplies that would be required for the trip. Therefore, the LDS Church established a revolving fund, known as the Perpetual Emigration Fund, to enable the poor to emigrate. By 1852, most of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo who wished to emigrate <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>so,</b> and the church abandoned its settlements in Iowa. However, many church members from the eastern states and from Europe continued to emigrate to Utah, often assisted by the Perpetual Emigration Fund.|$|E
5|$|In {{the month}} of September, {{less than a month}} away from the Afro-Asian Games, the Transport Ministry of Hyderabad {{released}} a large number of luxury vehicles, {{to be used in the}} Games.
