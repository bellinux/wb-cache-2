This design is based on a critical analysis of impurity effects of the different parts of the Hartshorn bridge. With this equipment frequencies up to 0. 5 MHz can be used. Two methods have been developed to examine the secondary signal. In one of these use {{has been made of}} AD conversion techniques. In the other one, the secondary signal, produced by a superconducting sample, which is generally distorted, is analysed by using a Fourier expansion. In Part 2 equipment is described which enables us to measure the phase and amplitude of the harmonics of the output signal of the bridge. For synchronous detection a reference signal of the same frequency of the harmonic of interest is required. This reference signal is generated from the input signal of the bridge by means of a digital frequency multiplier with programmable multiplication factor N.

40|$|Current traffic {{research}} is mostly {{based on data}} from fixed-installed sensors like <b>induction</b> loops, <b>bridge</b> sensors, and cameras. Thereby, the traffic flow on main roads can partially be acquired, while data from the major part of the entire road network are not available. Today's optical sensor systems on satellites provide large-area images with 1 -m resolution and better, which can deliver complement information to traditional acquired data. In this paper, we present an approach for automatic vehicle detection from optical satellite images. Therefore, hypotheses for single vehicles are generated using adaptive boosting in combination with Haar-like features. Additionally, vehicle queues are detected using a line extraction technique since grouped vehicles are merged to either dark or bright ribbons. Utilizing robust parameter estimation, single vehicles are determined within those vehicle queues. The combination of implicit modeling and the use of a priori knowledge of typical vehicle constellation leads to an enhanced overall completeness compared to approaches which are only based on statistical classification techniques. Thus, a detection rate of over 80 % is possible with very high reliability. Furthermore, an approach for movement estimation of the detected vehicle is described, which allows the distinction of moving and stationary traffic. Thus, even an estimate for vehicles' speed is possible, which gives additional information about the traffic condition at image acquisition time...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{advocate}} {{a new model}} for inductive learning. Called sequential <b>induction,</b> this model <b>bridges</b> classical fixed-sample learning techniques (which are efficient but ad hoc), and worst-case approaches (which provide strong statistical guarantees but are too inefficient for practical use). According to the sequential inductive model, learning is a sequence of decisions which are informed by training data. By analyzing induction {{at the level of}} these decisions, and by utilizing the minimum data necessary to make each decision, sequential inductive techniques can provide the strong statistical guarantees of worst-case methods, but with substantially less data than those methods require. The sequential inductive model is also useful as a method for determining a sufficient sample size for inductive learning and as such, is relevant to megainduction,where the preponderance of data introduces problems of scale.

40|$|Chromosomal {{alterations}} {{can arise}} from numerous events, including errors during cell division or repair of damaged DNA. Of these errors, segregational defects such as anaphase bridges and multipolar spindles {{play a major}} role in chromosomal instability, leading to tumorigenesis. Bridges can theoretically be produced by several mechanisms including telomere-telomere fusion, persistence of chromatid cohesion into anaphase or repair of broken DNA ends. DNA damage can induce anaphase bridges following exposure to agents such as hydrogen peroxide or ionizing radiation (IR). Our hypothesis is that while the majority of double strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired, to restore the original chromosome structure, incorrect fusion events also occur leading to bridging and that bridge formation allows cells to bypass the apoptotic pathways that are activated in response to DNA damage. To test this, we set out to determine what pathways the cells use to heal the damage and form bridges. Our data suggest that neither of the two major pathways used by the cell for repair of double strand breaks, homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), is required for bridge formation. In fact, the NHEJ pathway seems to play a role in the prevention of bridges. When NHEJ is compromised, the cell appears to use HR to repair the break, resulting in increased anaphase bridge formation. Moreover, intrinsic NHEJ activity of different cell lines appears to be correlated with <b>induction</b> of <b>bridges</b> from DNA damage. Our preliminary data also suggest that cell lines with high levels of bridging are capable of apoptosis, yet further experiments are required to see if blocking bridging can enhance cell death. Multipolar spindles are aberrant mitotic figures when a cell divides into two or more poles, which can lead to uneven segregation of the chromosomes. In our studies, we found that IR treatment can lead to an increase in multipolarity shortly after treatment and changes the distribution of spindle pole components. Initial observations on the splitting of centrosomal proteins following IR treatment are presented...|$|R

40|$|What {{predictions}} about behavior in extensive form games can we rigorously justify as implied by rationality or mutual or common knowledge of that rationality? This paper models rational belief revision in extensive form games and uses numerical methods {{to examine the}} implications for equilibrium predictions. In general, in dynamic strategic choice situations, the method of belief revision adopted by the players will determine which {{of a set of}} possible equilibria (or non-Nash strategy choices) is selected. This intuition has motivated critiques of subgame perfection, including the argument that the reasoning supporting backward induction is paradoxical. This paper examines this question with models of the dynamics of transitions between epistemic states. These models give belief revision functions which are well-defined for updating on zero probability events and are equivalent to Bayesian updating where that is defined. Thus the gap between the standard game model and the intuition driving some of the critiques of backward <b>induction</b> can be <b>bridged</b> with this approach. It appears that the class of equilibria that we obtain with this model are neither implied by, nor imply, Nash equilibrium. The sequential nature of the definition of individual rationality and the possibility of rational belief revision yield a model which implies sequential equilibrium when there is sufficient mutual knowledge of rationality and selects equilibria that satisfy forward induction. But since neither knowledge of the other players' sequential rationality nor correct beliefs are imposed, non-Nash, but individually sequentially rational, outcomes are also supported in equilibrium. rationality in games, belief revision, equilibrium selection...|$|R
40|$|Folic acid plays a {{key role}} in the {{maintenance}} of genomic stability, providing methyl groups for the conversion of uracil to thymine and for DNA methylation. Besides dietary habits, folic acid metabolism is influenced by genetic polymorphism. The C 677 T polymorphism of the methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene is associated with a reduction of catalytic activity and is suggested to modify cancer risk differently depending on folate status. In this work the effect of folic acid deficiency on genome stability and radiosensitivity has been investigated in cultured lymphocytes of 12 subjects with different MTHFR genotype (four for each genotype). Cells were grown for 9 days with 12, 24 and 120 nM folic acid and analyzed in a comprehensive micronucleus test coupled with centromere characterization by CREST immunostaining. In other experiments, cells were grown with various folic acid concentrations, irradiated with 0. 5 Gy of gamma rays and analyzed in the micronucleus test. The results obtained indicate that folic acid deficiency induces to a comparable extent chromosome loss and breakage, irrespective of the MTHFR genotype. The effect of folic acid was highly significant (P 50 % of variance of both types of micronuclei. Also nucleoplasmic bridges and buds were significantly increased under low folate supply; the increase in bridges was mainly observed in TT cells, highlighting a significant effect of the MTHFR genotype (P = 0. 006) on this biomarker. Folic acid concentration significantly affected radiation-induced micronuclei (P < 0. 001) : the increased incidence of radiation-induced micronuclei with low folic acid was mainly accounted for by carriers of the variant MTHFR allele (both homozygotes and heterozygotes), but the overall effect of genotype did not attain statistical significance. Treatment with ionizing radiations also increased the frequency of nucleoplasmic bridges. The effect of folic acid level on this end-point was modulated by the MTHFR genotype (P for interaction = 0. 02), with TT cells grown at low folic acid concentration apparently resistant to the <b>induction</b> of radiation-induced <b>bridges.</b> Finally, the effect of in vitro folate deprivation on global DNA methylation was evaluated in lymphocytes of six homozygous subjects (three CC and three TT).

40|$|Telomeres are {{nucleoprotein}} complexes {{that protect}} {{the ends of}} linear chromosomes and are required {{for a wide range}} of cellular processes, as apoptosis, aging, cancer and chromosome stability. Telomere shortens every time a somatic human cell divides. Furthermore human cancers, avoid the progressive loss of telomeric DNA by the telomerase or the telomerase-independent mechanism, termed ALT (Alternative Telomere Lengthening), result into indefinite cell proliferation. However, it has been demonstrated, that several physical or chemical agents are able to modulate telomere length; in particular oxidative stress accelerates telomere shortening. Literature data showed that telomeres are the preferential target for oxidative damage because of ROS able to induce 8 -oxodG from triplet GGG present in human telomeric sequence TTAGGG. Nevertheless, the effects of prolonged oxidative stress on telomere metabolism are still poorly investigated. With the aim to investigate the effects of oxidative stress on telomere length and chromosome segregation and to test mitotic defects, human primary lung fibroblasts (MRC- 5) were daily treated with 10 μM H 2 O 2 and analysed at regular intervals over period of 94 days. The telomere length analysed by Q-FISH (Quantitative-FISH), showed a telomere shortening at 9 - 21 days, and a telomere elongation between 21 - 48 days. Moreover we observed that this trend of “shortening-lengthening” was repeated on time up to 94 days. Based on this repeated trend, we focused our attention to the first 45 days, because at longer time several mechanisms, as senescence, not straight related to oxidative stress effects, could interfere with the results. At this interval of time, we saw a significant telomere shortening after 5 days and a telomere elongation at 15 days of treatment. Based on these results, we confirm that prolonged oxidative stress is responsible of telomere shortening even at low daily doses. Considering that telomere shortening could have an effect on cell viability, first of all, we analysed other endpoints: a) Possible cell cycle perturbation by Cytofluorimetric analysis. We noticed any differences between treated and own control samples. b) The entity of DNA damage induced by prolonged treatment with H 2 O 2 by “Alkaline Comet Assay”. Moreover we used Trypan Blue Assay to evaluate cell viability and this analysis has relieved in all cases that cell death was less than 30 %, value above which the mortality is considered significant. c) To understand if the DNA damage and telomere shortening observed could induce premature senescence, we assessed the number of β- galattosidase positive cells, typically expresses in senescence cells. As expected, we observed a light trend of senescence on time in treated and control samples, with a difference between the two only at 10 - 15 and 20 - 27 days. This led us to conclude that oxidative stress did not induce significant premature senescence in treated cells. Considering that telomere shortening did not alter cell viability, we studied the mechanism responsible of telomere elongation observed at 15 days. To evaluate this mechanism the analysis of telomerase activity was performed by RTQ-TRAP assay that showed no telomerase activation for all fixation times. On the other hand, to verify ALT activation, we assessed two ALT markers: telomeric-sister chromatid exchanges (T-SCE) by CO-FISH analysis and colocalization of telomeres-PML proteins by FISH and immunostainig. We showed a higher frequency of both these ALT markers at 15 days of treatment, corresponding to the time of telomere elongation observed. This led us to hypothesize Human Primary Fibroblast could activate ALT mechanism, known in literature be present in a little percentage of tumor cells. However we cannot exclude the presence of a cellular selection system that promotes cells with longer telomeres due their major viability. In literature is known that telomere shortening could alter chromosomes segregation by inducing chromosome bridges (end-to-end fusion). To analyse the relation between telomere length and chromosome segregation defects, like chromosome bridges, during my period at the Virginia Tech University we performed Time lapse on live cells and immunostainig (that detect Kinetochore and mitotic spindle) in mitotic cells in the range of 1 - 48 days. Data obtained were pulled and showed an increase of chromosome bridges in treated cells at 5, 27, 41 and 48 days of treatment. The <b>induction</b> of chromosome <b>bridges</b> at 5 days indicated a relation between telomere shortening and chromosome segregation defects. Moreover the reduction of chromosome bridges, observed at 15 days, was related to telomere lengthening saw at the same day. Based on these results, we could observe that telomere shortening induced by oxidative stress at 5 days of treatment could triggers the increase of chromosome <b>bridges</b> <b>induction.</b> Subsequently, we observed a chromosome bridges decrease corresponding to the time of telomere elongation and based on previous results obtained, we hypothesized that ALT mechanism restores telomere length inducing a reduction of chromosome segregation defects related to telomere shortening. In fact, according to literature data, the loss of chromosome ends could result in “sticky” chromosomes that will give rise to dicentric/ring chromosomes: when these dicentric/ring chromosomes will try to separate in anaphase, they will create a chromosome bridge that breaks before or in transition to telophase. Then, the breakage of bridge will create new sticky chromosome ends that could fuse with other sticky ends or that could determine the sister chromatid fusion at the following cell cycle, creating the so called “breakage/fusion/bridge cycle” (BFB). This BFB cycle will continue until the affected chromosome will acquire a new telomere, as in our case when ALT mechanism restores the telomere length. To further assess the effects of telomere length changes on chromosome instability, we evaluated abnormal nuclear structures at 1 - 20 days. We estimated the quantity of NBPs (nucleoplasmic bridge) and NBuds (nuclear Buds), markers of chromosome segregation defects, measuring a significant increase of these biomarkers at 5 days of treatment and confirming previous result obtained for chromosome bridges. These data have been supported by anaphase-lagging chromosomes, marker of chromosome loss. In both fixed- and live-cells. We observed an increase in anaphase lagging chromosomes frequencies over the control at 5, 20, 27 and 41 days of treatment. Additionally, kinetochore positive micronuclei (MN) were analysed by immunostainig. Kinetochore positive MN represents a marker of chromosome loss and aneuploidy (Fenech, M. and Morley, A. A. 1985). Our analysis resulted in a significant increase of kinetochore positive MN in almost all-fixing time. With the aim to evaluate if also other mitotic defects, in addition to chromosome segregation defects, were induced by prolonged oxidative stress, cells with tilted mitotic spindles, defined as the positioning of the spindle long axis at an angle instead of parallel to the substrate, were observed. We observed frequencies of tilted spindles above the control frequencies during the first 10 days, at 27, and 48 days of treatment. These results indicated that prolonged oxidative stress affected spindle structure and/or function. Thus, in addition to the telomeric damage, which causes chromosome rearrangements and can result in chromosome bridges in mitosis, prolonged oxidative stress could also induce telomere-independent mitotic defects, such as MN, lagging chromosomes, which can result in aneuploidy, and cells with tilted spindle. Taken together, these data indicated that prolonged oxidative stress could cause the two most common karyotype defects observed in cancer cells: chromosome rearrangements and aneuploidy...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} ionizing radiation (IR) target in eukaryotic cells is the chromosomal asset. The radio-sensitivity of cycling cells, is generally {{dependent on their}} damage repair ability {{and a set of}} factors which promotes the maintenance of genome integrity. The aim of this work, dealing with several types of IRs and their effects on cycling cell cultures, is manifold: it is a study on the cytogenetic damage of low doses on normal human fibroblasts (i), it is a study addressed to investigate any hypothetic radiation sensitizer role of the dysfunctions of the telomere homeostasis on lymphoblastoid human cells (ii), and finally (iii) it is addressed to highlight the role of the cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity and its contribution to the cytogenetic radio-induced damage on normal human fibroblasts pharmacologically treated to this purpose. (i) For a long time the response of a biological system to IR exposure has been supposed proportional to the dose delivery, even the low-dose range, according to the so-called Linear No Threshold Model. Indeed it is a practical and conservative approach due to the general lack of data in that dose range. Based on deterministic data obtained at higher doses, it is suitable as guideline for the risk assessment in a variety of different situations. Things have changed since a set of non-linear trends (§ 1. 16) emerged, such as the low-dose hyper-radio-sensitivity/induced-radio-resistance, the bystander effect, and the adaptive response. So far, the cell survival is the most used endpoint to test the occurrence of such non-linear phenomena, in this work instead, cytogenetic skills have used in order to verify hypothetic non-linear behaviors of endpoints such as the chromosomal damage, the telomere length modulation, and the induced genome instability, in dependence on the dose and the type of IR (low- and high- LET). According to the LNTM the fitted functions of the dose-response charts should be strictly monotonic even in the low-dose range, whilst in event of non-linear behaviors, abnormal peaks or flat trends should be reported. We measured the radio-induced damage in two ways: as induction of chromosome exchanges and breakages, through a whole karyotype painting technique (§ 3. 1), and as <b>induction</b> of chromatine <b>bridges</b> in anaphase (§ 3. 3), through traditional staining. About the induction of such aberrations, the outcome is that no substantial deviation from linearity has been demonstrated. The underlying model is mere probabilistic: the yield and complexity of damage depends only on the dose delivery, the Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) of the radiation (fig 14, 15, 18) and the DNA content of the target (fig 16) without hypersensitivity or threshold effects (§ 4. 1, 4. 2. 1). (ii) Coming to the effect of IR exposure on the telomere, to be reminded that it is an important genome stabilizing factor: it avoids the chromosomal termini to be processed as Double Strand Breaks (DSBs), and the chromosome end-end fusion. An effect of IRs on the modulation of telomere length, in terms both of elongation and shortening depending on the radiation type used, has been reported for high doses. Instead, on the basis of our data, such a modulation is missing in the low-dose range (§ 3. 2) for all the radiation types tested. Moreover, the telomere does not significantly participate in the genomic instability triggered on by IRs as revealed by the anaphase bridges analysis (§ 3. 3 fig 18). On the basis of this outcome relative to the low-dose range, speculations on a linearity failure are allowed (§ 4. 2. 1). Ultimately, low doses of IRs induce chromosome instability, but not via the telomere homeostasis perturbation, despite its well-known role played in the chromosome asset destabilization/stabilization. Therefore, we have been persuaded to weight the telomere role in the radio-resistance at doses of X-rays of therapeutic order of magnitude. As the functional telomere is one genome stabilizing factor, IRs are by definition destabilizing agents, able to induce cell inactivation through the genome injury. Moreover, a cell is characterized by a mean telomere length, and a mean spontaneous lack of some telomeres (basal telomere loss frequency). On the aforementioned assumptions, an enhanced radio-sensitivity rationally is expected in case of telomere homeostasis dysfunction. As amid the same cell line the telomere length is spread around a mean value different from cell to cell, then the telomere-related genome stability is supposed to differ from cell to cell (§ 3. 4. 1), and by hypothesis it may result in a different inherent radio-resistance. We tested this speculation on several monoclonal lymphoblastoid lines: several clones have been isolated, independently cultured and characterized for the telomere functionality and for the radio-resistance. The outcome is that the short telomeres do not confer radio-sensitivity to the line, while a frequency of telomere loss beyond a threshold does (§ 3. 4. 6 fig 25), thus the telomere dysfunction may be involved in the differential radio-sensitivity of clones obtained from the same population (§ 4. 2. 2), and shows potential as radio-sensitivity marker. (iii) The mitochondrion is a physiological source of ROS and the main player of their homeostasis, therefore it is supposed to have some indirect involvement in the radio-damage mechanisms. To be reminded in fact that DNA is injured both by direct radiolysis and by means of reactive species released by the water radiolysis. Far to be clear, this role is object of several speculations: for example, irradiated mitochondria are supposed to establish a long-term ROS release, moreover, the mitochondrial metabolism is supposed to amplify the activity of ROS generated by IRs (§ 1. 15). The increased ROS activity, generated by mitochondrial impairment, has been related to chromosomal abnormalities, genomic instability, and telomere damage. On the other hand, ROS overproduction, due to the same impairment, paradoxically may be seen as cytoprotective, through engaging countermeasures, as in the so-called adaptive response (§ 1. 18). To address the role of mitochondria-related ROS activity in the response to IRs, we pharmacologically set a fibroblast line upset in the mitochondrial functionality, that showed an increase of the basal ROS activity due to ROS homeostasis imbalance (§ 3. 5. 1). This model, in which mitochondria are turned into ROS diffusers (fig 29), is aimed to report, through the analysis of cytogenetic endpoints, any differential response to the IRs in comparison to a control line, to ultimately verify whether the increased endogenous ROS activity acts additively or synergistically with the exogenous radio-damage. The pharmacological treatment resulted in a basal increased frequency of DSB (§ 3. 5. 5) and spontaneous chromosomal fragmentation (§ 3. 5. 7), conversely no damage on the telomere was detected (§ 3. 5. 6 fig 30, 31). After irradiation, we observed that the cytogenetic damage yield was the sum of the radio-induced and the basal ROS-induced damage via mitochondrial impairment, without synergistic effect. In conclusion, relatively to our data the mitochondrion is not an important player in the damage induction via IRs (§ 4. 3) ...|$|R
