500|$|During {{his tenure}} Kennedy {{became one of}} the most {{recognizable}} and influential members of his party, and was sometimes called a [...] "Democratic icon" [...] as well as [...] "The Lion of the Senate". Kennedy and his Senate staff authored around 2,500bills, of which more than 300 were enacted into law. Kennedy co-sponsored another 550bills that became law after 1973. Kennedy was known for his effectiveness in dealing with Republican senators and administrations, sometimes to the irritation of other Democrats. During the 101st Congress under President George H. W. Bush, at least half of the successful proposals put forward by the Senate Democratic policy makers came out of Kennedy's Labor and Human Resources Committee. During the 2000s, almost every bipartisan bill signed during the George W. Bush administration had significant involvement from Kennedy. A late 2000s survey of Republican senators ranked Kennedy first among Democrats in bipartisanship. Kennedy strongly believed in the principle [...] "never let the perfect be the enemy of the good," [...] and would agree to pass legislation he viewed as incomplete or imperfect with the goal of improving it down the road. In April 2006, Kennedy was selected by Time as one of [...] "America's 10 Best Senators"; the magazine noted that he had [...] "amassed a titanic record of legislation affecting the lives of virtually every man, woman and child in the country" [...] and that [...] "by the late 1990s, the liberal icon had become such a prodigious cross-aisle dealer that Republican leaders began pressuring party colleagues not to sponsor bills with him". In May 2008, soon-to-be Republican presidential nominee John McCain said, [...] " [...] is a legendary lawmaker and I have the highest respect for him. When we have worked together, he has been a skillful, fair and generous partner." [...] Republican Governor of California and Kennedy relative Arnold Schwarzenegger described [...] "Uncle Teddy" [...] as [...] "a liberal icon, a warrior for the less fortunate, a fierce advocate for <b>health-care</b> <b>reform,</b> a champion of social justice here and abroad" [...] and [...] "the rock of his family".

40|$|Introduction: Major <b>health-care</b> <b>reforms</b> have {{extended}} across all Australian public hospitals in recent years. Improving emergency department (ED) access {{has been a}} focus of these reforms. Objective: This study evaluates how the national reforms have led to improvement in ED access in a regional hospital in remote Australia. Methods: Assessing a complex scenario such as national reforms and the challenges faced by the regional hospital to implement these reforms requires in-depth analysis. A realist evaluation theory-based approach was employed, allowing investigation of what, how, why, and for whom change occurred. A case study mixed methods design was adopted within the realist framework {{to answer these questions}} about change. Results and Conclusion: The study identified moderate improvement in ED access {{as a result of the}} reforms (investment in infrastructure and workforce and the introduction of ED targets). Clinical leadership and support from management were essential for the improvement. Without ongoing investment and clinical redesign activities, however, sustainability of the improvement may prove difficult...|$|R
40|$|Many {{countries}} reorganizing {{their health}} services are drawn toward similar reform programs {{and tend to}} experience what seem to be similar problems relating to implementation outcomes. One such problem is the major crisis within the nursing profession relating to the labor market, working conditions and level of autonomy. This research examines the thesis that the profile of nursing problems is global (the 'convergence' thesis) by comparing the changing hospital contexts nursing has been confronting in 20 Western European countries between 1990 and 2001. The analysis indicates {{that in spite of}} growing convergence, the divergence in patient care processes, workforce composition and resources allocated for care is still rather remarkable and that similarity or divergence between countries changes over time. This contextual variability highlights why problems such as the crisis of the nursing profession must be analysed from a divergent rather than a convergent perspective.

30|$|Due {{to recent}} {{reforms in the}} Dutch {{healthcare}} system, the number of elderly people remaining at home longer continues to rise. By 2020, 800 of the 2000 nursing homes in the Netherlands will be closed due to increasingly stringent cost-containment policies involving the Long-Term Care Act introduced in 2015 [1]. The Social Support Act 2015 transferred publicly provided care to the private sector, calling for more self-reliance {{on the part of}} citizens and creating a larger role for municipalities in its organization. This led to a reduction in the household support and home care that is provided to patients needing temporary services following hospital discharge, patients with chronic conditions requiring medical services, people with mental or psychological disabilities, and individuals in need of end-of-life care [2, 3]. The main goal of these <b>health-care</b> <b>reforms</b> is to keep care affordable and to increase both the system’s efficiency and its responsiveness to patient needs. These reforms, in combination with the aging of the population, will lead to a strong increase in the demand for informal care in the Netherlands [4, 5].|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} goals and effects of health-care policy in the Netherlands over the period 1980 - 2000. During this period Dutch health-care policy {{is marked by a}} {{peculiar}} combination of increasingly stringent cost-containment policies alongside a persistent pursuit of market-oriented reforms. The main goal of cost containment was to keep labour costs down under the restriction of universal equal access to health care. Supply and price control policies were quite successful in achieving cost containment, but in due course prolonged quantity rationing began to jeopardise universal physical access to health services. The main goal of market-oriented <b>health-care</b> <b>reforms</b> is to increase the system's efficiency and its responsiveness to patient's needs, while maintaining equal access. The feasibility of the reforms crucially hinges on the realisation of adequate methods of risk adjustment, product classification and quality measurement, an appropriate consumer information system and an effective competition policy. Realising these preconditions requires a lengthy and cautious implementation process. Although considerable {{progress has been made in}} setting the appropriate stage for regulated competition in Dutch health care, the role of the market is still limited.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{contribute}} to the understanding of the institutional arrangements within which China's rural health facilities are embedded and of the contribution of policy to the creation of these arrangements. Information collected through field observations and in-depth interviews with the managers, staff and patients of a township health centre indicates that with the gradual evolution of markets, encouraged by state policies, health care in rural China took on more of the characteristics of a commodity. In order to adapt to this change, the health centre and its employees are adjusting their behavioural norms and reconstructing an institutional network within which daily activities of simultaneously fulfilling public health responsibilities and pursuing economic gain are legitimized. This article focuses on the interwoven relationship between politics and markets at the micro level and examines the negotiations between stakeholders in constructing new institutional arrangements. It also describes how health sector managers are creating regulations to influence the performance of their facility. The article argues that while government policies play a crucial role in shaping the direction of development, institutional arrangements strongly influence the attempts by rural health organizations to implement them. It concludes that it is critical to take institutional factors into account in analyzing China's rural <b>health-care</b> <b>reforms.</b> ESR...|$|R

40|$|Background: Work {{satisfaction}} of doctors {{is a useful}} indicator of {{the functioning of the}} health-care system. We documented the work {{satisfaction of}} doctors nine years apart, before and after the implementation of several <b>health-care</b> <b>reforms</b> (limitation of working hours for medical trainees, restrictions on new doctors' offices, new reimbursement fee schedule, greater administrative controls). Methods: Two surveys of all doctors working in the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland (1998 : 1146 respondents, 2007 : 1546 respondents). The doctors filled in a 17 -item questionnaire rating their satisfaction with different aspects of their professional life, each on a scale between 1 and 7. For each item, proportions of highly satisfied (scores 6 - 7) and highly dissatisfied (scores 1 - 2) doctors were compared over time. Results: The proportion of doctors who were highly satisfied decreased significantly for 15 out of 17 items between 1998 and 2007. Meanwhile, ‘time available for family, friends, or leisure' improved, and ‘opportunity for continuing education' remained stable. Proportions of highly satisfied respondents decreased the most for ‘enjoyment of work' (− 17. 2 %), ‘autonomy in treating your patients' (− 15. 8 %), ‘autonomy in referring patients to a specialist' (− 14. 0 %), ‘relations with patients' (− 13. 9 %) and ‘global satisfaction with current work situation' (− 13. 3 %). The proportion of respondents who were highly dissatisfied (score 1 - 2) increased the most for ‘administrative burden' (+ 8. 9 %) and ‘social status and respect' (+ 5. 0 %). Conclusions: Doctors' satisfaction with most aspects of their professional lives has decreased sharply during the past decade.

40|$|Objective. This study {{assesses the}} impact of state policy reforms on health {{insurance}} coverage in the U. S. states considering three approaches to reform: consumer protection policies, policies relaxing regulation on insurance companies, and policies expanding public benefits. Methods. Using data collected from several publicly available sources, we estimate state insurance coverage using fixed-effects pooled time-series regression from 1992 to 2005. Results. We find that the only policies that had {{a positive effect on}} coverage were those expanding public benefits. None of the other state policy measures were associated with increased coverage and pricing restrictions actually were associated with reduced coverage. Conclusion. We argue that a federal-state partnership offers an imperfect short-term strategy but that in the long run, states are incapable of assuming the burden of fully covering the uninsured. Since the 1930 s, presidents of both parties—Truman, Nixon, Carter, and Clinton—have endorsed a variety of <b>health-care</b> <b>reforms</b> to promote universal coverage to no avail (Quadagno, 2004, 2005). As a result, the number of uninsured has continued to increase. In 1994, the year President Clinton’s Health Security Plan failed, 19 percent of men and 15. 5 percent of women aged 19 to 64 had no health insurance; by 2007, 22. 1 percent of men and 17. 9 percent of women in this age group were uninsured (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2009). Despite the lack of action at the federal level, {{in the past two decades}} the states have enacted a myriad of reforms, all intended to reduce the number of uninsured. States have become the primary sites of health-care innovation. There are several reasons why this is the case. First, since the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 affirmed insurance regulation as a primary stat...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{the past}} decades, <b>health-care</b> <b>reforms</b> have been {{implemented}} in several countries. A general aspect of most of these reforms is the shift from a supply-oriented system to a demand- oriented system. In several countries these reforms were based on introducing managed competition. In these systems of managed competition, insurers can selectively contract with health care providers or point out preferred providers. In {{order to make the}} system work, insurers should somehow channel their insured to these providers. In this study, we focused on insurants’ opinions on channelling by health insurers. Methods: Questionnaires were sent to 1559 members of the Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel and to 3418 members of the Insurants Panel in 2009. The questionnaire was returned by 1056 members of the Consumer Panel (response 68 %) and by 2223 members of the Insurants Panel (response 65 %). Among other things, opinions were asked on situations where insurers ask insurants to go to another health care provider. A discrete choice experiment was used to find out whether positive financial incentives could be effective in channelling insurants to preferred providers. Results: Results show that it depends on the type of care whether insurants are positive or negative about channelling by their insurer. Furthermore, financial incentives seem to be effective in stimulating insurants to go to preferred providers, only if the general practitioner (GP) does not have a preference for another provider and the distance to a preferred provider is not longer than the distance to the usual provider. Conclusions: This study shows that when there is a personal relationship with the health care provider, namely with a GP or dentist, people are less positive about channelling by health insurers. For drugs they are more positive. Furthermore, the GP {{plays an important role in}} choices patients make. Therefore, it is difficult for insurers to channel their insurants to preferred providers. Positive financial incentives can be effective, but the GP is still most important. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
