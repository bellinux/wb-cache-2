5|$|Fortune's activities—including her {{leadership}} of the new group {{and a series of}} articles that she wrote for The Occult Review—raised concerns for Alpha et Omega leader Moina Mathers. After Fortune suggested that her own organisation could serve as a feeder group to Mathers's Alpha et Omega, Mathers expelled her from the order, claiming that this was necessitated by Fortune having the wrong signs in her aura. Fortune later claimed that she subsequently came under psychic attack from Mathers, during which she was confronted and assaulted by both real and <b>etheric</b> cats.|$|E
5|$|Her first magical mentor was the Irish occultist and Freemason Theodore Moriarty. She had befriended {{him while}} still {{involved}} in psychotherapy, believing {{that he could}} help one of her patients, {{a young man who}} had been fighting on the Western Front and claimed to be plagued by unexplained physical phenomena. Moriarty performed an exorcism, claiming that the young man was the victim of the soul of a deceased East European soldier which had latched onto him as a parasite. Fortune became an acolyte of Moriarty's Masonic-influenced lodge, which was based in Hammersmith, and joined his community of followers living at Gwen Stafford-Allen's home in Bishop's Stortford. Moriarty spent much time talking about the lost city of Atlantis, a topic that would also come to be embraced by Fortune. Fortune later fictionalised Moriarty as the character Dr. Taverner, who appeared in a number of short stories first published in 1922, later assembled in a collected volume as The Secrets of Dr. Taverner in 1926. Like Moriarty, Dr. Taverner was portrayed as carrying out exorcisms to protect humans from the attacks of <b>etheric</b> vampires.|$|E
5|$|The Fraternity's rituals {{at their}} Bayswater temple {{were carried out}} under a dim light, with Fortune {{claiming}} that bright light disperses <b>etheric</b> forces. An altar {{was placed in the}} centre of a room, with the colours of the altar-cloth and the symbols on the altar varying according to the ceremony being performed. A light was placed on the altar while incense, usually frankincense, was burned. The senior officers sat in a row along the eastern end of the room, while officers—who were believed to be channels for cosmic forces—were positioned at various positions on the floor. The lodge was opened by walking around the room in a circle chanting, with the intent of building a psychic force up as a wall. Next, the cosmic entities would be invoked, with the members believing that these entities would manifest in astral form and interact with the chosen officers.|$|E

25|$|Many modern Esoteric Christian {{movements}} acknowledge reincarnation {{among their}} beliefs, {{as well as}} a complex energetic structure for the human being (such as <b>etheric</b> body, astral body, mental body and causal body). These movements point out the need of an inner spiritual work which will lead to the renewal of the human person according to the Pauline sense.|$|E
25|$|Astral {{projection}} is a paranormal {{interpretation of}} out-of-body experiences that assumes {{the existence of}} one or more non-physical planes of existence and an associated body beyond the physical. Commonly such planes are called astral, <b>etheric,</b> or spiritual. Astral projection is often experienced as the spirit or astral body leaving the physical body to travel in the spirit world or astral plane.|$|E
25|$|The later Theosophical {{arrangement}} {{was taken up}} by Alice Bailey, and from there found its way (with variations) into the New Age worldview. It is also associated with the human aura observed through Kirlian photography and Kilner screens. The anthroposophical view {{of the human being}} found in Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophical teachings usually referred to only the <b>Etheric</b> and Astral Bodies. However, Steiner also used a threefold classification of body, soul, and spirit as well as a sevenfold and a ninefold description.|$|E
25|$|The surveys {{revealed}} that atheistic Satanists {{appeared to be}} in the majority, although the numbers of theistic Satanists appeared to grow over time. Beliefs in the afterlife varied, although the most popular afterlife views were reincarnation and the idea that consciousness survives bodily death. The surveys also demonstrated that most recorded Satanists practiced magic, although there were differing opinions as to whether magical acts operated according to <b>etheric</b> laws or whether the effect of magic was purely psychological. A number described performing cursing, in most cases as a form of vigilante justice.|$|E
25|$|Scientific work on {{electromagnetic}} radiation convinced Lodge that an ether existed {{and that it}} filled the entire universe. Lodge {{came to believe that}} the spirit world existed in the ether. As a Christian Spiritualist, Lodge had written that the resurrection in the Bible referred to Christ's <b>etheric</b> body becoming visible to his disciples after the Crucifixion. By the 1920s the physics of the ether had been undermined by the theory of relativity, however, Lodge still defended his ether theory and rejected relativity. Linked to his belief in Spiritualism, Lodge had also endorsed a theory of spiritual evolution which he promoted in Man and the Universe (1908) and Making of Man (1924). He lectured on theistic evolution at the Charing Cross Hospital and at Christ Church, Westminster. His lectures were published in a book Evolution and Creation (1926).|$|E
500|$|The Andersons {{taught that}} there were three parts of the soul, with Doyle White believing that they had adopted this belief from those of Hawaii. Cora stated that {{the first part of}} the soul {{inhabited}} [...] "the <b>etheric</b> body or double", surrounding and penetrating the physical body, extending about 2cm from human flesh and colored either [...] "a misty blue-gray" [...] or [...] "a lovely electric pink". According to her, the second part of the soul inhabited the aura and extended 8 to 9 inches from the physical body. She believed that the third part of the soul was [...] "the Godself" [...] and lived in the top of the aura, appearing as a blue, white or gold ball of light. The Andersons also expressed a belief in reincarnation, believing that the allocation of one's future births were organized by karma. They taught that between incarnations, a soul could travel to one of nine <b>etheric</b> globes surrounding the Earth, in which existed [...] "well-defined classes of nature spirits" [...] which included gnomes, sylphs, undines, and salamanders.|$|E
500|$|Gunnerkrigg Court, {{the fictional}} place {{around which the}} story revolves, is a mysterious and vast {{establishment}} that many characters suspect hides {{much more than just}} a school. The school appears to actively recruit many talented or extraordinary students. As the story progresses, it is soon revealed that the school is inhabited by a wide variety of both supernatural creatures – many of which become characters involved in the story's plot – and ultra-modern technology. One character explains that [...] "the Court was founded on a union between technological and <b>etheric</b> design." [...] Another describes it as [...] "man's endeavor to become god." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to this plotline, the story includes several additional plot arcs interspersed with the main story. One concerns two girls from the Court, Zimmy and Gamma, who {{communicate with one another}} telepathically. [...] Zimmy sees hallucinations of monsters which her <b>etheric</b> abilities turn into reality, which she relies on Gamma to dispel.Zimmy: [...] "Yer gonna have ta take Gamma's place.... Gettin' ridda these guys." [...] In one chapter, Antimony and another student, Jack, also become trapped briefly in Zimmy's hallucinatory world, and escape after they [...] "find" [...] Gamma there. Another storyline revolves around Kat's attempts to repair Antimony's robot (which had been temporarily taken control of when it pushed her off the bridge), during which time they discover a set of highly complex robots that Antimony speculates are related in some way to the ghost she encountered at the river.|$|E
500|$|Anderson {{was born}} on May 21, 1917 at the Buffalo Horn Ranch in Clayton, New Mexico. His parents were Hilbart Alexander Anderson (1883–1952) and [...] Mary Frances Anderson (née Smith, 1886–1973). Regarding his ethnic ancestry, he later stated that [...] "I am mostly Irish and Spanish with some Native American, {{including}} Polynesian". He also claimed that his maternal great-grandmother {{had been one of}} the Blue Fugates, a community living in Appalachia whose skin had a blueish coloration due to methemoglobinemia. Anderson became almost completely blind when he was two years old, either because of an accident or untreated diabetes. By 1920, the family were living in Burkburnett, Wichita County, Texas, where a sister, Elsie Glenan Anderson, was born in February. Here, Hilbart worked as a floor worker on some of the many oil rigs in the town. From there they moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where they were recorded as living in the 192324 directory, and where Anderson later claimed that he had made many friends among Mexican migrant children. Anderson's later wife claimed that he was also instructed in how to use his <b>etheric</b> vision by [...] "Mexican Witches" [...] during childhood. The family next moved to Olustee, Oklahoma, where Hilbart's brother resided.|$|E
500|$|During {{the time}} that the robot is gone, Antimony meets a {{creature}} called Reynardine, who tries to take over her body but, by accident, instead becomes trapped in the body of a stuffed animal she carries; and becomes subject to her command. Because of her relationship with Reynardine and the events with Coyote and Ysengrin, Antimony is nominated to begin training to become a medium, one of the individuals who moderate disputes between the Wood and the Court and communicates with <b>etheric</b> beings, and she decides to return to the woods to speak with Coyote. When Antimony visits Coyote, she learns that in the past Coyote had travelled across the sea to find Renard (called later Reynardine) and Ysengrin and make them into [...] "powerful being" [...] like himself.Antimony: [...] "Why were you looking for Renard in the first place? [...] Why bring him here?"Coyote: [...] "I sought to make him into a powerful being such as myself!" [...] He had given Ysengrin [...] "power over the trees" [...] and given Reynardine the power to take bodies, but bodies that Reynardine took always died after he left themCoyote: [...] "For some reason, when Renard had the ability , any body he took that was not his own would die when it was used up." [...] and Ysengrin was hardly strong enough to stand without the help of Coyote's tree armor. Reynardine had been in love with Antimony's mother, Surma,Coyote: [...] "I wouldn't be surprised if he cared very deeply about you, ! You see, Renard fell desperately in love with Surma!" [...] and had used his power to steal a young man's body and woo Surma; the man died, however, and Reynardine was imprisoned in Gunnerkrigg Court until the events surrounding his first meeting with Antimony.Coyote: [...] " [...] soon runs away! He steals the body of a young man and disappears into the Court, looking to woo the fiery Surma. [...] We heard he was captured, tricked! ... and I did not see him again until last summer." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Max Heindel, the <b>etheric</b> [...] "double" [...] {{serves as}} a medium between the astral and {{physical}} realms. In his system the ether, also called prana, is the [...] "vital force" [...] that empowers the physical forms to change. From his descriptions it can be inferred that, to him, when one views the physical during an out-of-body experience, one is not technically [...] "in" [...] the astral realm at all.|$|E
2500|$|The Subtle {{physical}} is Sri Aurobindo's {{term for}} a subtler aspect of the physical nature. This has many qualities {{not found in the}} gross physical nature. [...] In The Agenda, The Mother often refers to it. It might be compared to the <b>etheric</b> body and plane, or even the astral body and plane. The term [...] "subtle physical" [...] is used to distinguish it from gross (sthula) or outer material physical.|$|E
2500|$|Roger J. Woolger said, {{in a paper}} {{presented}} to the [...] "Beyond the Brain" [...] Conference held at Cambridge University in 1999, [...] "In Tansley as in Brennan you will find descriptions of a hierarchy of subtle bodies called the <b>etheric,</b> emotional, mental and spiritual that surround the physical body.

The Linga Sarira (sometimes called astral body by Blavatsky) was denominated by Annie Besant as <b>Etheric</b> double. C.W. Leadbeater, regarding the emotional body as the seat of the kamic principle of Blavatsky's constitution, denominated it astral body. Therefore, the subtle bodies in a human being are: ...|$|E
2500|$|Chris's family {{contacts}} {{a medium}} who can see but not hear Chris, and they conduct a séance. Chris tries {{to communicate with}} them, but tires and goes off to sleep. When he awakens, he is horrified to find himself staring at a figure of himself conversing with the family. The psychic is unknowingly feeding this figure some answers he expects to hear, unaware that he's not conversing with the real Chris. The novel later explains that the figure is the shedding of Chris's <b>etheric</b> body to release his spirit body, enabling him to ascend to Heaven, or [...] "Summerland." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Linga Sharira is the {{invisible}} double {{of the human}} body, elsewhere {{referred to as the}} <b>etheric</b> body, doppelgänger or bioplasmic body and serves as a model or matrix of the physical body, which conforms to the shape, appearance and condition of his [...] "double". The linga sarira can be separated or projected a limited distance from the body. When separated from the body it can be wounded by sharp objects. When it returns to the physical frame, the wound will be reflected in the physical counterpart, a phenomenon called [...] "repercussion". At death, it is discarded together with the physical body and eventually disintegrates or decomposes.|$|E
2500|$|The Theosophist Arthur Powell (1927) was {{an early}} author to {{advocate}} the subtle body theory of OBEs. Sylvan Muldoon (1936) embraced {{the concept of an}} <b>etheric</b> body to explain the OBE experience. The psychical researcher Ernesto Bozzano (1938) had also supported a similar view describing the phenomena of the OBE experience in terms of bilocation in which an [...] "etheric body" [...] can release itself from the physical body in rare circumstances. The subtle body theory was also supported by occult writers such as Ralph Shirley (1938), Benjamin Walker (1977) and Douglas Baker (1979). James Baker (1954) wrote that a mental body enters an [...] "intercosmic region" [...] during the OBE. Robert Crookall in many publications supported the subtle body theory of OBEs.|$|E
2500|$|Jon Klimo, in Investigations on Receiving Information from Paranormal Sources, writes, [...] "As with Blavatsky/Theosophical material, {{and more}} recent {{contemporary}} channeled material from other sources, {{we find in}} the Bailey work the same occult cosmological hierarchy: physical, <b>etheric,</b> astral, mental, causal, and higher inhabited levels of existence." [...] Olav Hammer, in the book Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age, highlights Bailey's Theosophical similarities as well as noting what he thinks are some differences between them: [...] "To a large extent, Bailey's teachings are a restatement and amplification of theosophy of the Secret Doctrine. Bailey inherited from Blavatsky and Leadbeater a predilection for profuse details and complex classificatory schemes. ... Her books have also introduced shifts in emphasis {{as well as new}} doctrinal elements." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though this usage {{continues}} to be widespread, the term, [...] "etheric travel", used by some later Theosophists, offers a useful distinction. Some experients say they visit different times and/or places: [...] "etheric", then, is used to represent {{the sense of being}} [...] "out of the body" [...] in the physical world, whereas [...] "astral" [...] may connote some alteration in time-perception. Robert Monroe describes the former type of projection as [...] "Locale I" [...] or the [...] "Here-Now", involving people and places that actually exist: [...] Robert Bruce calls it the [...] "Real Time Zone" [...] (RTZ) and describes it as the non-physical dimension-level closest to the physical. This <b>etheric</b> body is usually, though not always, invisible but is often perceived by the experient as connected to the physical body during separation by a [...] "silver cord". Some link [...] "falling" [...] dreams with projection.|$|E
2500|$|Some NESARA {{supporters}} {{also make}} the claim that otherworldly beings are working to get NESARA announced. These include a [...] "channeled" [...] cosmic being called [...] "Hatonn" [...] (an android Pleiadean), and another named Sananda. According to some Ascended Master Teaching proponents such as Joshua David Stone, Sheldan Nidle, and Luis Prada, Sananda is the [...] "galactic name" [...] of Ascended Master Jesus, which he uses {{in his role as}} Commander-in-Chief of the Ashtar Command flying saucer fleet. Pallas Athena is regarded as being the Vice-Commander of the saucer fleet. Ashtar (Ashtar Sheran) is regarded in these teachings as being third-in-command. Saint Germain, an Ascended Master borrowed from the I AM Movement and the Church Universal and Triumphant, along with benevolent aliens from the Galactic Federation, are also frequently mentioned (most prominently by Nidle) as working towards the NESARA announcement. The designation of George W. Bush as a disguised reptilian often co-occurs with this claim. Goodwin has claimed that Ascended Master Saint Germain has come down from the <b>etheric</b> plane to physically meet with heads of banks and world leaders regarding the NESARA announcement.|$|E
2500|$|Speculation on {{silicon hydride}} {{chemistry}} started from the 1830s, contemporary {{with the development}} of synthetic organic chemistry. Silane itself, as well as trichlorosilane, were first synthesised by Friedrich Wöhler and Heinrich Buff in 1857 by reacting aluminium–silicon alloys with hydrochloric acid, and characterised as SiH4 and SiHCl3 by Charles Friedel and Albert Ladenburg in 1867. Disilane (Si2H6) followed in 1902, when it was first made by Henri Moissan and Samuel Smiles by the protonolysis of magnesium silicides. Further investigation had to wait until 1916 because of the great reactivity and thermal instability of the silanes; it was then that Alfred Stock began the study of silicon hydrides in earnest with new greaseless vacuum techniques, as they were found as contaminants of his focus, the boron hydrides. The names silanes and boranes are due to him, based on analogy with the alkanes. Moissan and Smiles' method of preparation of silanes and silane derivatives via [...] protonolysis of metal silicides is still used, although the yield is lowered by the hydrolysis of the products that occurs simultaneously, and thus the preferred route today is to treat substituted silanes with hydride reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride in <b>etheric</b> solutions at low temperatures. Direct reaction of HX or RX with silicon, possibly with a catalyst such as copper, is also a viable method to produce substituted silanes.|$|E

6000|$|Before {{leaving this}} section of the subject, I should say a few more words upon the {{evidence}} as it affects the <b>etheric</b> body. This body is a perfect thing. This is a matter of consequence in these days when so many of our heroes have been mutilated in the wars. One cannot mutilate the <b>etheric</b> body, and it remains always intact. The first words uttered by a returning spirit in the recent experience of Dr. Abraham Wallace were [...] "I have got my left arm again." [...] The same applies to all birth marks, deformities, blindness, and other imperfections. None of them are permanent, and all will vanish in that happier life that awaits us. Such is the teaching from the beyond--that a perfect body waits for each.|$|E
6000|$|... "Seeing cannot {{mean the}} same with them that it does with us," [...] exclaimed Fowler. [...] "You {{remember}} Crookes {{put his finger on}} the print of a newspaper behind his back, and the 'spirit' spoke the word that was under his finger-tip. They apprehend by means of some form of <b>etheric</b> vibration not known to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Blake {{is as much}} to {{be trusted}} as I am. No, I am forced to a {{practical}} acceptance {{of the theory of}} the fluidic arm, and yet this is a most astounding admission. We must suppose that the psychic was able to read our minds and write down our mingled and confused musical conceptions by means of a supernumerary hand. It happens that I have since seen these <b>etheric</b> hands in action, which makes it easier for me to conceive of such a process. I have seen them dart forth from another medium precisely as described by Scarpa. I have seen them lift a glass of water, and I have had them touch my knees beneath a table while slate-writing was going on--so that, given the power to read my mind, there is nothing impossible (having regard to Bottazzi's definite experiments) in the idea of the <b>etheric</b> hand's setting down the music and reproducing the signature of 'E. A.' In fact, at a recent sitting in a private house with a young male psychic, we had this precise feat performed. Said the psychic to our host, Dr. Towne, 'Think hard of a signature that is very familiar to you,' and Dr. Towne fixed his mind upon the signature of his brother, and immediately, while the young man's material hands were controlled, his <b>etheric</b> hand seized a pencil {{in the middle of the}} table and reproduced the signature." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "More than that. She {{has been}} able to emit {{supernumerary}} <b>etheric</b> limbs, perhaps a complete material double of herself, which is able to move with lightning speed and perfect precision. It is this actual externalization of both matter and sense that makes darkness so essential to the medium. Vivid light forces this effluvia, this mysterious double, back into its originating body with disrupting haste. Witness the several times when Mrs. Smiley was convulsed merely by being touched at the wrong moment." ...|$|E
60|$|Along {{these lines}} he {{proposed}} (with Victor's aid) to study his psychic guest. He had {{lost sight of}} the fact that he was to be her defender in court--or if he remembered it, it was only as a secondary consideration. He had no faintest hope of directly proving the continued existence of his wife and children; but he could see that a demonstration of the power of the living body to project and maintain at a distance an <b>etheric</b> brain, a voice, made (by inference) a belief in immortality possible.|$|E
6000|$|... "My good Summerlee, this <b>etheric</b> poison is most {{certainly}} influenced by material agents. We {{see it in}} the methods and distribution of the outbreak. We should not a priori have expected it, but it is undoubtedly a fact. Hence I am strongly of opinion that a gas like oxygen, which increases the vitality and the resisting power of the body, would be extremely likely to delay the action of what you have so happily named the daturon. It may be that I am mistaken, but I have every confidence in the correctness of my reasoning." ...|$|E
6000|$|In such {{ways and}} others his mind ran {{as he read}} swiftly through the wondrous record of {{experiments}} made in Rome, in Naples, in Milan. He liked these Italians better than the greatest of the Englishmen {{for the reason that}} they uttered no apology to the Pope. They proceeded on the assumption that they were biologists, not priests. They had no care whether their discoveries harmonized with some man's Bible, or whether they did not. The question was simple: Could the human organism put forth from itself a supernumerary hand or arm? Could it project an <b>etheric</b> double of itself? Could it interpenetrate matter? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{that does}} not really militate against the ideoplastic theory," [...] I retorted. [...] "It is as easy to produce a phantom with hair plaited {{as it is to}} produce one with hair in curls. If it is a case of the {{modelling}} of the <b>etheric</b> vapor by the mind of the psychic, these differences would be produced naturally enough. The forcible handling of the medium by the invisible ones is a much more difficult thing for me to explain, for to imagine the psychic emitting a form of force which afterward proceeds to raise the psychic herself against her will--as Mrs. Smiley testifies happened again and again in her youth--is to do violence to all that we know of natural law. And yet {{it may be that the}} <b>etheric</b> double is able to take on part of the forces resident in the circle of sitters, and so become immensely more potent than the psychic himself, as in the case of the 'Man from Mars'--the Hercules I have just been telling you about. Then, as to the content of these messages, they may be impulses, hints, fragments of sentences caught from the air as one wireless operator intercepts communications meant for other stations than his own. So that my interview with 'E. A.' may have been a compounding of the psychic, Blake, and myself, and fugitive natures afloat in the ether. In fact, I am not as near a belief in the return of the dead as I was when I began this last series of experiments. These Italian scientific observers, I confess, have profoundly affected my thought." ...|$|E
