Pressuremeter tests, dilatometer tests and static probes were made. The tests were performed on the study site in Piskorzec near Iłów. In this region, <b>ice-dammed</b> clays are present almost from the land surface reaching the thickness of about 11 m. This site is the westernmost experimental site of clays of the “Warsaw <b>Ice-Dammed</b> Lake” among those presented in the literature. Research and their analysis showed differences in deformability due to the test procedure in connection with the structure of varved clays. Pressuremeter test, even though it is the most time consuming and challenging among the tests performed, allows the most complete characteristics of deformability of varved clays to be obtained. Vertical profile of clays being studied appears to be fairly homogeneous in terms of mechanical properties. Nevertheless, some parts of the profile clearly differ from the average values. This indicates the rate of post sedimentary changes varied in different parts of research profile. The data obtained are consistent with the values for <b>ice-dammed</b> clays from Radzymin and Sochaczew areas. Comparison of the engineering properties of varved clays to other experimental sites points to their similar geological history. It confirms that the experimental sites belong to one <b>ice-dammed</b> lake covering the areas of the Warsaw Basin...|$|R

We present a record of successive <b>ice-dammed</b> lake drainage events and associated ice-margin dynamics spanning 25 years. Robust calculations of lake volumes and peak discharges are made, based on intensive field surveys and utilizing high-spatial-resolution orthophotographs of the lake basin and ice margin. These data enable identification of controls on the behaviour of the <b>ice-dammed</b> lake and provide the first field-based examination of controls on jökulhlaup magnitude and frequency for this system. We find that Russell Glacier jökulhlaups have a much higher peak discharge than predicted by the Clague-Mathews relationship, which we attribute to an unusually short englacial/subglacial routeway {{and the presence of}} a thin ice dam that permits incomplete sealing of jökulhlaup conduits between lake drainage events. Additionally, we demonstrate that the passage of jökulhlaups through an interlinked system of proglacial bedrock basins produces significant attenuation of peak discharge downstream. We highlight that improved understanding of jökulhlaup dynamics requires accurate information about <b>ice-dammed</b> lake volume and ice-proximal jökulhlaup discharge...|$|R

50|$|Thus, {{depending}} on the intermontane depression topography, the values, of the snow-line depression and of the glaciation energy, the interrelation of the glaciers and the <b>ice-dammed</b> lakes {{in the mountains of}} south of Western Siberia could develop according to the following scenarios: (1) A ledoyom only (no <b>ice-dammed</b> lake). In such cases some glacial and water-glacial relief forms and sediments would remain in the basins; (2) A water body and a ledoyom together (the stage of “catch lakes”). Certain forms of “dead ice” may remain in the basins, as well as intraglacial water-ice forms - eskers and kames which were projected onto the bottom lake deposits when the “shelf” ice descended; (3) “Aufeis” ledoyoms; (4) An <b>ice-dammed</b> lake only.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the potential role of icebergs in the 8. 2 ka climate event, using a coupled climate model {{equipped with an}} iceberg component. First, we evaluate {{the effect of a}} large iceberg discharge originating from the decaying Laurentide ice sheet on ocean circulation, compared to a release of an identical volume of freshwater alone. Our results show that, on top of the freshwater effect, a large iceberg discharge facilitates sea-ice growth as a result of lower sea-surface temperatures induced by latent heat of melting. This causes an 8 % increased sea-ice cover, 5 % stronger reduction in North Atlantic Deep Water production and 1 °C lower temperature in Greenland. Second, we use the model to {{investigate the}} effect of a hypothetical two-stage lake drainage, which is suggested by several investigators to have triggered the 8. 2 ka climate event. To account for the final collapse of the <b>ice-dam</b> holding the Laurentide Lakes we accompany the secondary freshwater pulse in one scenario with a fast 5 -year iceberg discharge and in a second scenario with a slow 100 -year iceberg discharge. Our experiments show that a two-stage lake drainage accompanied by the collapsing <b>ice-dam</b> could explain the anomalies observed around the 8. 2 ka climate event in various climate records. In addition, they advocate a potential role for icebergs in the 8. 2 ka climate event and illustrate the importance of latent heat of melting in the simulation of climate events that involve icebergs.

40|$|Ground-penetrating radar {{was used}} to {{elucidate}} the stratigraphy of late Pleistocene gravel dunes in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia that formed when a lake emptied {{as a result of}} <b>ice-dam</b> failure. Survey-lines across dunes had a resolution of decimetres, with depth penetration of 20 [*]m. The reflections identify bounding surfaces and radar facies. Two classes of unconformities are identified: (1) an erosional unconformity {{at the base of the}} dunes; (2) steeply inclined unconformities that truncate underlying inclined reflections and are downlapped by overlying inclined reflections within the dunes. Unconformities define six radar facies (RF) : RF 1, basal subhorizontal discordant reflections; RF 2, poorly defined discordant reflections; RF 3, planar inclined reflections; RF 4, sigmoidal inclined reflections; RF 5, trough fills; RF 6, low-angle inclined reflections. The basal unconformity represents the flood-cut surface, across which the dunes migrated. The inclined unconformities may be interpreted in two ways: (1) erosional surfaces induced by unsteady flow within one flood, or (2) erosional surfaces developed by a series of floods reactivating dunes left stranded by previous floods. The evidence favours the latter model, which is consistent with the occurrence of several dune-forming events within the basin.

40|$|The {{drainage}} of <b>ice-dammed</b> lakes produces floods {{that can}} pose hazards, waste water resources and modulate ice flow. In this thesis I investigate {{several aspects of}} <b>ice-dammed</b> lake drainage through the development and analysis of mathematical models. After an introduction in the first chapter and {{a description of the}} mathematical background to the thesis in the second, the third chapter investigates the mechanisms behind observed variability in the size and timing of subglacial floods from <b>ice-dammed</b> lakes. In particular, I examine how environmental controls like the weather and the shape of glaciers affect floods. In the next chapter, I quantify how well simple models can predict the dates of floods from an ice-marginal lake in Kyrgyzstan. I find that incorporating environmental controls into models improves their prediction ability. Next I investigate the coupling between subglacial drainage and glacier motion during <b>ice-dammed</b> lake drainage by developing and analysing a model which couples a marginal lake, glacier sliding, subglacial drainage through a channel and subglacial drainage through a distributed system of cavities. I show how changes in lake level cause the rate at which a glacier slides to increase {{during the first half of}} floods and decrease during the second half. The next two chapters are concerned with two lake-drainage scenarios that involve water flowing as an open stream: firstly, the subglacial open-channel flow that occurs after a marginal lake drains completely during a flood, and secondly, the drainage of supraglacial lakes across the surface of ice sheets. I end the thesis with a summary of my findings and some suggestions of theoretical and field-based investigations that are worthwhile pursing in the future. ...|$|R

40|$|We present {{velocity}} {{observations of}} a glacier outlet in Vatnajökull, Iceland, deduced from interferometric SAR (InSAR) data obtained during the ERS 1 / 2 tandem mission in 1995 – 2000. More than 50 % decrease in glacier motion was observed subsequent {{to a large}} jökulhlaup from the subglacial lake Grímsvötn in 1996. The glacier had not reached its former flow rate in 2000. The jökulhlaup damaged the lake's <b>ice-dam</b> causing persistent drainage from the lake. InSAR based studies of water accumulation within Grímsvötn suggest that a leakage of &gt; 3 m 3 s&minus; 1 prevailed throughout our study period. We suggest that the lake leakage kept open a tunnel at low water pressure underneath the whole length of the glacier. The tunnel flow drained water from its surroundings, hence lowering the water pressure of a distributed drainage system, underneath the upper and centre part of the glacier, which prior to the jökulhlaup sustained significant basal sliding. This is in accordance with theoretical prediction that tunnel flow in a steady state may cause slow-down in glacier motion by reducing the subglacial water pressure. The width of the affected areas was ~ 5 km on {{the upper part of}} the glacier and ~ 8 km on the centre part of the glacier.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of the catastrophic draining of Pleistocene glacial-lake Kuray–Chuja quantify the discharge {{history of the}} draining event in detail. The plan-view basin flows are modelled as water emptied due to the instantaneous failure of the impounding <b>ice-dam</b> when the lake was at maximum capacity. The Chuja Basin water exited as a jet-flow into the Kuray Basin via a narrow conjoining valley. The peak discharge from the Chuja Basin is etermined to be 1. 20 × 107 m 3 s? 1, and the peak discharge (3. 19 × 107 m 3 s? 1 > Q ? 2. 0 × 107 m 3 s? 1) that flowed from the Kuray Basin at the failed impoundment is also calculated for two limiting conditions. The variations in lake volume and depth indicate complete drainage within 50 h. In both basins, fields of relict gravel bedforms reflect sediment transport due to entrained lake-bed sediments. Thus, {{in addition to the}} general overview of drainage, the detailed temporal and spatial evolutions of drainage parameters are reported, including for the locations of the bedform fields. Local flow above the bedforms is considered in relation to thresholds for sediment motion, bedform development, and orientations. Within the simple bathymetry of the Chuja Basin, the flow field was fairly uniform with flow conducive to bedform evolution only occurring close to the exit from the basin, which accords with field evidence. In contrast, within the Kuray Basin, the flow responded sensitively to the complex bathymetry, which included rapid changes in flow direction due to interaction of the Kuray water with the jet-flow from Chuja, and as submerged ridges shoaled. Thus the Kuray flow field was complex but with time-dependent flow conditions in ccordance with bedform development. It is concluded that the location of the bedforms can be explained in terms of the flow modelling and suggestions are made as to how future drainage models might be improved...|$|E
