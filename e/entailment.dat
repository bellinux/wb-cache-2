25|$|Similar {{but more}} complex {{translations}} {{to and from}} algebraic logics are possible for natural deduction systems as described above and for the sequent calculus. The entailments of the latter {{can be interpreted as}} two-valued, but a more insightful interpretation is as a set, the elements of which can be understood as abstract proofs organized as the morphisms of a category. In this interpretation the cut rule of the sequent calculus corresponds to composition in the category. Boolean and Heyting algebras enter this picture as special categories having at most one morphism per homset, i.e., one proof per <b>entailment,</b> corresponding to the idea that existence of proofs is all that matters: any proof will do and {{there is no point in}} distinguishing them.|$|E
25|$|Inheritance was by descent, {{but could}} be further {{restricted}} by <b>entailment,</b> which would restrict inheritance to male heirs only. In {{the case of the}} Bennet family, Mr. Collins was to inherit the family estate upon Mr. Bennet's death and his proposal to Elizabeth would have ensured her future security. Nevertheless, she refuses his offer. Inheritance laws benefited males because most women did not have independent legal rights until {{the second half of the}} 19th century. As a consequence, women's financial security at that time depended on men. For the upper-middle and aristocratic classes, marriage to a man with a reliable income was almost the only route to security for the woman and her future children. The irony of the novel's opening line, therefore, is that generally within this society it would be a woman who would be looking for a wealthy husband in order to have prosperous life.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{an approach to}} classifying word senses and semantic roles {{that focuses on the}} <b>entailments</b> that can be drawn from sentences. A key observation is that <b>entailments</b> arise from sentences, not word senses, and by taking a compositional approach to deriving <b>entailments,</b> we can significantly simplify the number of senses that are required. In addition, we argue that most uses of semantic roles can be replaced by taking prepositional meaning seriously, resulting in a strongly compositional approach to computing sentence meaning. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For {{debugging}} OWL-DL ontologies, {{natural language}} explanations of inconsistencies and undesirable <b>entailments</b> are of great help. From such explanations, ontology developers can learn why an ontology {{gives rise to}} specific <b>entailments.</b> Unfortunately, commonly used tableaux-based reasoning services do not {{provide a basis for}} such explanations, since they rely on a refutation proof strategy and normalising transformations that are difficult for human ontology editors to understand. For this reason, we investigate the use of automatically generated justifications for <b>entailments</b> (i. e., minimal sets of axioms from the ontology that cause <b>entailments</b> to hold). We show that such justifications fall into a manageable number of patterns, which {{can be used as a}} basis for generating natural language explanations by associating each justification pattern with a rhetorical pattern in natural language...|$|R

500|$|A few of {{the rights}} were drawn from Spanish practices. [...] The {{proposed}} constitution forbade the English practices of primogeniture and <b>entailment,</b> following a change made to Spanish law in 1821. [...] Delegates retained the traditional Spanish prohibition against seizing a debtor's physical property and extended it to forbid imprisonment as a punishment for debt. [...] This was a novel idea. [...] In the United States, nine states had enumerated certain conditions under which a debtor could not be imprisoned, but no state had an unqualified prohibition on the practice.|$|E

By the time of Max Joseph's death, he had legitimated seven of the males of his various alliances, and was considering the legitimation of two more. With this host of male offspring, although Charles Theodore certainly wished to acquire more territory, he needed it to be territory that he could bequeath through his testament, rather than territory encumbered by a legal <b>entailment</b> that could only pass to a legitimate child.|$|E
500|$|The later {{career of}} Sir Andrew Baynton, with whom Pleydell {{had served as}} Member for Marlborough, was overshadowed by {{financial}} difficulty. In a perceived attempt to gain court favour and reduce his debts, Baynton entrusted Thomas Seymour with his lands (presumably temporarily). When Seymour was executed for treason in 1549, the lands fell into the possession of the crown. Queen Mary negotiated their sale to {{several members of the}} Wiltshire gentry, including Nicholas Snell and Pleydell. Gabriel would acquire the manor houses of the Bremhill and Bromham parishes in 1562. Pleydell is thought to have gone further in the pursuit of Baynton's estates; he and Henry Sharington were to be the executors of his will upon his death in 1564. Assigning themselves his properties in Chippenham, the couple (described by Alison Wall in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as [...] "scoundrels" [...] and by R.J.W. Swales as [...] "unscrupulous adventurers") directed Baynton's money and estates to themselves, contrary to his intended <b>entailment</b> of the assets to his brother Edward. Sharington has consequently been described by Wall as [...] "corrupt" [...] and Pleydell as [...] "notorious"; according to Bindoff, the action [...] "confirm for Gabriel Pleydell a niche in parliamentary history, detract still further from his reputation". Pleydell released any titles inherited from the acquired estates, which included the manors of the Clench and Stanley hamlets, to Edward Baynton (Andrew's brother) on 19 July 1566 and the Privy Council therefore rejected allegations of forgery against him. Edward had long been suspicious of Pleydell and Sharington, and brought an unsuccessful forgery charge against them to a prerogative court as early as July 1560. He also ordered an attack on Pleydell's servants after his acquisition of the Bremhill and Bromham properties.|$|E

40|$|Module {{extraction}} is {{the task}} of computing a (preferably small) fragment M of an ontology O that preserves a class of <b>entailments</b> over a signature of interest E. Extracting modules of minimal size is well-known to be computationally hard, and often algorithmically infeasible, especially for highly expressive ontology languages.
