500|$|On receipt, the {{sketches}} and letter were forwarded to the Commission of Fine Arts, charged since 1921 with making recommendations on coinage design, {{and then to}} its sculptor member, James Earle Fraser, designer of the Buffalo nickel. Fraser wrote to Rossi on May 18, deprecating the designs, [...] "the bear is <b>entirely</b> <b>too</b> short, {{and the whole thing}} inexperienced and amateurish." [...] He recommended that Chester Beach (credited with the design of the 1923 Monroe Doctrine coin) or Robert I. Aitken (who had created the 1915 Panama-Pacific $50 pieces) be hired, as both were from California and might create [...] "something which would be far more interesting and with a bigger sense of what California really is".|$|E
500|$|Etty {{exhibited}} {{the painting in}} February 1828 at the British Institution under the title of Venus Now Wakes, and Wakens Love. It immediately met with a storm of derision from critics for the style in which Venus was painted; {{one of the few}} positive reviews was that of The New Monthly Magazine, whose critic considered [...] "the figure of Venus is delightfully drawn and most voluptuously coloured; {{and the way in which}} she awakens love, by ruffling the feathers of his wings, is exquisitely imagined and executed". The Times commented that [...] "the drawing is free and flowing" [...] and [...] "the colouring, though rich, is perfectly natural", but felt that [...] "the subject is, however, handled in a way <b>entirely</b> <b>too</b> luscious (we might, with great propriety, use a harsher term) for the public eye". The Literary Gazette conceded that the painting was [...] "very attractive, especially in colour", but considered the painting's [...] "voluptuousness" [...] as [...] "one of the most unpardonable sins against taste", and chided Etty's [...] "careless" [...] drawing, observing that [...] "it is impossible that an artist who has for so many years, and so unremittingly, studied the living model, can err in that respect from want of knowledge". The Monthly Magazine complained of Venus's [...] "sullen colour and corpulent shape", as well as Etty's [...] "excessive exposure of [...] figure". La Belle Assemblée, meanwhile, felt that Etty's representation of Venus [...] "though a fine voluptuous woman, is not, either in supremacy of beauty, or according to any received description of the love-inspiring goddess, a Venus", and complained that [...] "the colouring of the flesh is chalky".|$|E
500|$|A Love Surreal {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 82, based on 11 reviews. AllMusic's Andy Kellman said Bilal had improved {{as a producer}} and songwriter while remaining [...] "supernaturally skilled and creative" [...] as a vocalist, [...] "swooping, diving, wailing, and sighing, all with complete command." [...] Paste magazine's Evan Rytlewski said [...] "for {{the first time in}} his career, Bilal no longer sounds like an artist with <b>entirely</b> <b>too</b> much to prove; he's just a great singer, backed by great players he puts to good use on a set of sticky, deceptively inventive songs". Writing for NPR, Ann Powers said that A Love Surreal [...] "cultivates the stratospheric vibe" [...] of Coltrane's A Love Supreme while Bilal's ambition is [...] "grounded in fierce intelligence and a commitment to letting stories unfold all the way to their sometimes sorrowful, sometimes orgasmic end." [...] Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe called it [...] "bracingly good", [...] "compelling music" [...] that allows Bilal's [...] "falsetto to bring the intimate lyrics to life." [...] In The New York Times, Jon Pareles said his [...] "full-fledged" [...] voice [...] "needs no studio aid" [...] on songs that [...] "tease and insinuate" [...] with [...] "meanderings [...] lead somewhere." [...] Pitchfork journalist Jayson Greene was less impressed. He said it was a [...] "joy" [...] to listen to Bilal [...] "warp his voice into improbable shapes", but believed the music lacked any prominent melodies. Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times was more critical of the closing series of slow jams and [...] "atmospheric clutter", while writing that the album's best songs [...] "warrant the increased attention" [...] in Bilal.|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{its limited}} uses {{and the great}} {{variability}} {{in the quality of}} individual units, the grid Audion would be rarely used during the first half-decade after its invention. In 1908, John V. L.

2500|$|After {{completing}} her {{commission for}} the archbishop, Cassatt traveled to Madrid and Seville, where she painted {{a group of}} paintings of Spanish subjects, including Spanish Dancer Wearing a Lace Mantilla (1873, in the National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution). In 1874, she {{made the decision to}} take up residence in France. She was joined by her sister Lydia who shared an apartment with her. Cassatt opened a studio in Paris. Louisa May Alcott's sister, Abigail May Alcott, was then an art student in Paris and visited Cassatt. Cassatt continued to express criticism of the politics of the Salon and the conventional taste that prevailed there. She was blunt in her comments, as reported by Sartain, who wrote: [...] "she is <b>entirely</b> <b>too</b> slashing, snubs all modern art, disdains the Salon pictures of Cabanel, Bonnat, all the names we are used to revere".|$|E
2500|$|Yet another Conclave {{took place}} in Viterbo, therefore, with seven {{cardinals}} in attendance. [...] Cardinal Simon de Brion was still in France as papal legate. But {{this was not an}} easy conclave. [...] Three of the electors belonged to the Angevin faction, and three opposed it. [...] The only surviving Cardinal-Bishop, the Benedictine Bertrand de Saint Martin, wavered back and forth, providing little leadership. [...] The Conclave therefore went on for more than five and a half months. [...] Finally, on the Feast of S. Catherine, 25 November 1277, Cardinal Giovanni Gaetano Orsini was elected. [...] He chose the name Nicholas III. [...] The new pope set out immediately for Rome. [...] He was ordained a priest on December 18, consecrated a bishop on December 19, and crowned on the Feast of S. Stephen, 26 December. [...] His election portended serious difficulties, for he was not a candidate of King Charles of Sicily. [...] Quite the contrary, he believed that King Charles had <b>entirely</b> <b>too</b> much influence in church affairs and in the operation of the Papal States.|$|E

2500|$|While Cassie and Thelma strategize, new {{characters}} are introduced {{at the school}} while old ones depart. Troy, convinced that Cassie's child is his, left the school {{at the end of}} the first series. Jo Watkins, having [...] "really let herself go," [...] is seldom seen at school as she has become Azazeal's live-in nurse and nanny. The school gains a new chaplain, Jez Heriot, who doesn't [...] "wear the uniform" [...] except when conducting services and also teaches Ethics. When Jo effectively disappears, David Tyrel asks Jez to take her classes as well. The students don't initially realize that he is a priest, and Roxanne is quite taken with him, so much so that she can't help but seduce him even after the truth is known. A new student arrives at Medenham: Ella Dee. Her wardrobe instantly wins her points with the boys, evokes jealousy in the girls, and makes the faculty uncomfortable. Thelma is mildly attracted until she realizes that Ella can see her. There are other anomalies: Ella's tuition is paid by a corporation and her family background is unknown. She also seems to know <b>entirely</b> <b>too</b> much about Cassie... and Azazeal.|$|E
2500|$|Leafa has {{received}} generally positive critical reception. Karen Mead of Japanator.com critiqued Suguha's character as [...] "a fairly nuanced, sympathetic portrayal of someone {{falling in love}} with a blood relation due to an unfortunate set of circumstances, which is entirely different from the 'I love you, Oni-chan!', fetishism that we see all too often in anime [...] We get to know Suguha <b>entirely</b> <b>too</b> well for that", thus debunking criticism of [...] "Suguha falling for Kirito [...] toxic, awful siscon crap". Noting that the focus shifts away from Asuna towards Leafa in the Fairy Dance arc, Anime News Network's Theron Martin wrote in a review that [...] "Suguha's unrequited love seems more like a play meant to pander to 'Big Brother Complex' fans, though she does get some nice emotional development out of it and some very good scenes later on when the matter of her attempt to replace her misplaced love for Kazuto with Leafa's attraction to Kirito (who is also unknowingly her brother) blows up". Reviewing the spin-off manga Sword Art Online: Girls Ops, Martin praised it for Leafa's prominence in the storyline, and [...] "while Suguha was a veritable co-lead for one story arc, she has now been relegated to that role in the franchise, too".|$|E
2500|$|Other secular writers {{questioned}} Yoakum's faith healing practices. [...] As {{early as}} 1903, Yoakum claimed his movement had performed some 800 healings, and the Los Angeles Times described Yoakum as the [...] "leading apostle of the 'faith-healing' movement in this city." [...] However, the Times noted discrepancies in the dates and {{circumstances of the}} [...] "healings" [...] under the headline [...] "Pouring Oil on the Sick ... Stories Don't Jibe." [...] In 1909, the Los Angeles Times published a lengthy article criticizing Yoakum's tactics. [...] The article, titled [...] "No Miracles Without Cash: Services Halt While Money Is Collected," [...] described events {{at one of the}} healing services held at Pisgah Home. [...] The Times opened by quoting the Pisgah Home motto: [...] "God loves a cheerful giver." [...] It then described a [...] "Healing and Testimony of the Healed" [...] service:"Collection boxes were placed on the grounds about the home and in the tabernacle, and an extra large one was on the platform, where Dr. Yoakum and his assistants perform their miracles. [...] A large audience was present, but the sight alone of the collection boxes did not draw the dollars quite fast enough for the doctor, so the testimony service was stopped long enough for him to tell how necessary it is for one to give away all his money before entering the kingdom of heaven. [...] Dr. Yoakum said that he performs such miracles as mentioned in the Bible, but that the one-tenth of a person's income {{for the purposes of the}} Lord was <b>entirely</b> <b>too</b> small, and that every one should give all their money to God's servants, or rather servant. [...] After his talk the large box was placed on the front of the platform with the simple statement that there were several more at hand should one not prove large enough to hold all. [...] This admonition opened the persons of many and soon the space around the platform was crowded with cheerful givers, many of whom looked as though they needed the money at home. ... Dr. Yoakum said: 'If you have a debt to pay, do not hoard your money in trying to pay it and be a tight-wad, but give it for God's work and he will find a way for you to get along.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|Batman's designs range {{widely in}} the pages that are included, some {{modifications}} that were speculated included: chin guards with built-in radio and microphone, earphones built into the cowl, pouches and compartments on the boots, gauntlet and belt; wing-like capes with shoulder protrusions (which could have obstructed vision and snag in tight spaces); capes that were perfect simulations of bat wings, but would prove too heavy, variation in the length of ears, colors, designs that looked too [...] "fancy", too [...] "gimmicky", too [...] "Mysterioso" [...] (which was <b>entirely</b> red), <b>too</b> [...] "weird" [...] and too demonic.|$|R

2500|$|Joseph Luster of Otaku USA {{noted that}} the story is typical for its time, but said that this [...] "is overshadowed by its bold, filmic execution" [...] {{as well as its}} insight into Tatsumi's early career. Katherine Dacey of Manga Bookshelf found the art's anatomy lacking, but complimented its {{characterization}} and composition, concluding that the manga has [...] "a vital, improvisatory energy missing from Tatsumi's later period". Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics liked the manga's tense situations, but felt that the second half was slow with a weak ending, and said that Tatsumi's art is [...] "blocky and crude in places, but there's an energy about it that helps propel those early pages forward." [...] Connie C. of Comic Book Resources described it as a [...] "very straightforward crime story, [...] is well told, but doesn't get much more elaborate", but called it a [...] "beautiful example" [...] of a pulp short story. Tom Spurgeon called the manga [...] "a fun but rough work, full of character types and situations <b>entirely</b> <b>too</b> on the nose to reflect the nuances of certain moral questions brought to bear", especially disliking the ending and saying of the art: [...] "the best scenes in Black Blizzard have a physical immediacy that only arises from fundamentally solid cartooning with a corresponding attention to movement". Publishers Weekly called the story and layouts simple, and the art sometimes crude, but [...] "with a cinematic use of perspective, intensified via the characters and their circumstances, Tatsumi constructs a thrilling narrative with emotional depth." [...] Michelle Smith of Comic Book Resources said that the manga is [...] "a quick and fun hard-boiled adventure yarn", feeling that the story was [...] "silly" [...] and Shinpei's connection [...] "too convenient", but complimenting the [...] "fast-paced narrative" [...] and finding the rough art to suit the characters. The A.V. Club described the manga as a [...] "head-spinning blur of hardboiled suspense", likening the climax to Mickey Spillane's work, and calling Tatsumi's early art [...] "necessarily loose and frantic". Shawn O'Rourke of PopMatters compared the story's nervous tension to EC Comics stories and said that the art [...] "while simplistic, conveys a depth and nuance that engages the reader", adding that [...] "unwieldy exposition or narrative declarations" [...] are avoided, and that the manga [...] "is still eminently enjoyable in a way that so many of dated classics of that era are not." [...] ICv2 said that [...] "Tatsumi skillfully uses the conventions of the crime story to examine his characters who come from very different social backgrounds", calling Black Blizzard [...] "one of the first examples of the realistic, socially conscious, and adult (in the best sense of the term) gekiga genre of manga." [...] Deb Aoki of About.com said of the manga: [...] "while not as polished as his later works, this one-shot crackles with youthful energy, cinematic style, and Tatsumi's burning desire to push the boundaries of manga beyond kids stuff." ...|$|E

50|$|Whether introspection always fosters self-insight is not <b>entirely</b> clear.

60|$|Poor little face, {{distorted}} {{with terror}} and agony! One of the policemen recognised {{it as the}} child of the public-house in Tibb's Alley.

Mr. Kendal desired {{that it should be}} laid on the seat of the carriage, which he would drive gently to the doctor's. Genevieve got in to watch over the poor little boy, and the others walked on by the side, passed the battle-field, now <b>entirely</b> deserted, <b>too</b> much shocked for aught but conjectures on his injuries, and the cause of the misfortune.

60|$|Maggie, in her impulsiveness, wanted Philip to know at {{once the}} {{position}} they must hold toward each other; but she checked herself.

5000|$|As {{the program}} began its seventh season, McCormick commented on its growth:Three years ago, the demand for tickets to these {{broadcasts}} became so great that our original auditorium studio became <b>entirely</b> inadequate.

60|$|Maggie, {{all this}} while, was <b>too</b> <b>entirely</b> {{filled with a}} more agonizing anxiety to spend any thought on the view that was being taken of her conduct by the world of St. Ogg's; anxiety about Stephen, Lucy, Philip, beat on her poor heart in a hard, driving, ceaseless storm of mingled love, remorse, and pity. If she had thought of {{rejection}} and injustice at all, it would have {{seemed to her that}} they had done their worst; that she could hardly feel any stroke from them intolerable since the words she had heard from her brother's lips. Across all her anxiety for the loved and the injured, those words shot again and again, like a horrible pang that would have brought misery and dread even into a heaven of delights. The idea of ever recovering happiness never glimmered in her mind for a moment; it seemed as if every sensitive fibre in her were <b>too</b> <b>entirely</b> preoccupied by pain ever to vibrate again to another influence. Life stretched before her as one act of penitence; and all she craved, as she dwelt on her future lot, was something to guarantee her from more falling; her own weakness haunted her like a vision of hideous possibilities, that made no peace conceivable except such as lay {{in the sense of a}} sure refuge.|$|R
