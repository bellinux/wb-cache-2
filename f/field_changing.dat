CME impacts can induce magnetic reconnection in Earth's magnetotail (the midnight side of the magnetosphere); this launches protons and electrons downward toward Earth's atmosphere, where they form the aurora.|$|E

50|$|Vector magnetographs {{measure the}} {{longitudinal}} (line-of-sight) {{component of the}} magnetic field separately from the transverse (image-plane) components, using {{different aspects of the}} Zeeman splitting that affects the wavelength of emission and/or absorption spectral lines {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field. The Zeeman splitting is caused by the fact that individual atoms are magnetized due to the circulating motion of electrons bound to them. Emission or absorption of a photon changes the magnetic moment of the atom. In a magnetic field, photons emitted with different polarizations gain or lose energy depending on their orientation relative to the surrounding magnetic <b>field,</b> <b>changing</b> the characteristics of the spectral line—some polarization components are blue-shifted or red-shifted relative to the line's reference wavelength, by a factor proportional to the field intensity.|$|E

Greg Biffle suffered a pit road speeding penalty late in the race under green, causing him to lose the race. Carl Edwards {{looked to be a}} favorite to win the race in the closing laps, but a flat tire under a caution with about 20 laps to go destroyed his chances, as there were 33 cars on the lead lap. As the green flag came out, polesitter Kasey Kahne took the lead with 15 laps remaining from Brian Vickers in the Team Red Bull #83 Toyota and won his second points race of the season within the last three weeks.|$|E
50|$|A {{magnetic}} pickup {{consists of a}} permanent magnet with a core of material such as alnico or ferrite, wrapped with a coil of several thousand turns of fine enameled copper wire. The pickup is most often {{mounted on the body}} of the instrument, but can be attached to the bridge, neck or pickguard, as on many electro-acoustic archtop jazz guitars. Magnetic pickups used with string basses can be attached to the bridge. The permanent magnet creates a magnetic field; the motion of the vibrating steel strings disturbs the <b>field,</b> <b>changing</b> magnetic flux and inducing an electric current through the coil. The pickup is then connected with a patch cable to an amplifier which amplifies the signal to a sufficient magnitude of power to drive a loudspeaker. A pickup can also be connected to recording equipment via a patch cable. There may also be an internal preamplifier device mounted in an acoustic guitar or in an external box. When a preamp is used in this way, it is between the pickup and cable and can significantly reduce the equivalent impedance of the pickup coil.|$|E

The cesium ensemble did not interact with light and was thus transparent.

50|$|With {{the field}} closed up, di Grassi and Jérôme d'Ambrosio opted {{to make the}} {{mandatory}} switch into their second cars on the 18th lap, and although the change would enable the duo to gain positions when other drivers made their stops, it required di Grassi and d'Ambrosio to conserve electrical energy towards the race's end. Di Grassi and d'Ambrosio moved into first and second places {{as a result of}} the <b>field</b> <b>changing</b> into their second cars between the 24th and 26th laps. The safety car was deployed for Loïc Duval stopping on track with a battery issue. The safety car was withdrawn on lap 30 and di Grassi held the lead and conserved his electrical energy usage enough to make the finish, and secured his first victory of the season and the fifth of his career. Di Grassi's win ended Renault e.Dams's streak of six consecutive victories, extending back to the 2016 Berlin ePrix. Elsewhere in an action-packed race, Buemi finished 14th after spinning in an attempt to overtake Rosenqvist but earned one point for setting the fastest lap. Di Grassi's victory brought with it twenty-five points that put him five points behind Buemi in the championship contest.|$|E
