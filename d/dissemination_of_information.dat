25|$|The media enables {{concerned}} citizens {{to pick up}} images of criminal events— the perpetrators, the victims, motives, and sensational details of violent crimes; interpersonal communication and internet based social networks add to the <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> Fear may be generated if the individual identifies with the described victim, or feels that their own neighbourhood bears resemblance to the one described; then the image of risk may be taken up, personalised and translated into personal safety concerns. The media sometimes reports fear of crime through broader concerns about neighbourhood breakdown, the loss of moral authority, and the crumbling of civility and social capital.|$|E

In those settings, they have been found useful for collaboration on grant writing, strategic planning, departmental documentation, and committee work. In the mid-2000s (decade), the increasing trend among industries toward collaboration was placing a heavier impetus upon educators to make students proficient in collaborative work, inspiring even greater interest in wikis being used in the classroom.|$|E
25|$|Information science, in {{studying}} the collection, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval and <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> has origins in the common stock of human knowledge. Information analysis {{has been carried out}} by scholars at least as early as the time of the Abyssinian Empire with the emergence of cultural depositories, what is today known as libraries and archives. Institutionally, information science emerged in the 19th century along with many other social science disciplines. As a science, however, it finds its institutional roots in the history of science, beginning with publication of the first issues of Philosophical Transactions, generally considered the first scientific journal, in 1665 by the Royal Society (London).|$|E

25|$|Convective storm {{detection}} is the {{meteorological observation}} of deep, moist convection (DMC) {{and consists of}} detection, monitoring, and short-term prediction. Convective storms can produce tornadoes as well as large hail, strong winds, and heavy rain leading to flash flooding. The detection of convective storms relies on direct eyewitness observations, for example from storm spotters; and on remote sensing, especially weather radar. Some in situ measurements are used for direct detection as well, notably, wind speed reports from surface observation stations. It {{is part of the}} integrated warning system, consisting of prediction, detection, and <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> on severe weather to users such as emergency management, storm spotters and chasers, the media, and the general public.|$|E
25|$|According to David Shambaugh, {{professor}} of political science and international affairs at the Elliott School of International Affairs and a fellow of the Brookings Institution, the CCP's propaganda system extends itself as a sprawling bureaucratic establishment, into virtually every medium concerned with the <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> Shambaugh notes that according to the CCP publication Zhongguo Gongchandang jianshe dazidian. numerous public places, such as media and news organizations, educational institutions, literature and art centers, and cultural exhibitions come under CCP's propaganda oversight. Shambaugh believes that this expansive definition implies that every conceivable medium which transmits and conveys information to the people of China falls under bureaucratic purview of the CCP Propaganda Department (CCPPD). Shambaugh states that the writ of the CCPPD has remained unchanged since the Maoist era, although the mechanics of oversight and active censorship have undergone considerable evolution.|$|E
25|$|Social Networks {{are used}} also to {{communicate}} scientists research results {{and as a}} public communication tool and to connect people who share the same professional interests, their benefits can {{vary according to the}} discipline. The most interesting aspects of social networks for professional purposes are their potentialities in terms of <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and the ability to reach and multiply professional contacts exponentially. Social networks like Academia.edu, LinkedIn, Facebook, and ResearchGate give the possibility to join professional groups and pages, to share papers and results, publicize events, to discuss issues and create debates. Academia.edu is extensively used by researchers, where they follow a combination of social networking and scholarly norms. ResearchGate is also widely used by researchers, especially to disseminate and discuss their publications, where it seems to attract an audience that it wider than just other scientists.|$|E

25|$|During {{the process}} of state reporting, NGOs may {{indicate}} their interest to the secretariat on a particular state's report and then prepare a submission to be considered alongside the state report. The input of non-governmental organisations allows for an assessment {{on the state of}} civil, social and political rights and takes into account such assessments in the view of organisation that may to be affected by ICCPR principles. The utility of NGO input has been noted by the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna 1993 in its concluding Declaration, in the protection of human rights and in humanitarian services. NGO reports also give the public an opportunity to assist in the assessment of the government's overall adherence to the covenant or on particular matters. These reports may be assessed prior to the meeting or in some circumstances an NGO may be admitted to the meeting. Consequentially, the NGO may take a record of the meeting, facilitating <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> back to the state concerned.|$|E
