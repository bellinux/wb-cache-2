5|$|A month later, he {{was asked}} about <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Red Sox by one of the questioners in a YouTube Republican Presidential Debate run by CNN. In {{response}} to the mayor's answer, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who was in office during the Red Sox 2004 win, claimed that all Americans are united in hatred of the Yankees.|$|E
5|$|Later in {{the debate}} Dodd {{articulated}} <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> decriminalization of marijuana citing the high populations of American prisons. Many of the participants expressed their disagreement with him on this issue. The debate was the last campaign stop for Dodd in October who went into November with energy and momentum from the multiple exchanges.|$|E

5|$|Outside these countries, Bennett {{remained}} almost unknown as a musician, {{although his}} reputation as a conductor led Berlioz to invite him to join his Société Philharmonique, and the Dutch composer Johannes Verhulst solicited <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands Society for Encouragement of Music. Davison's attempts to interest the French composer Charles Gounod in Bennett's music led to polite but sardonic responses.|$|E
5|$|According to Naman Ramachandran, {{the author}} of , most of Rajinikanth's philanthropic {{activities}} went unpublicised {{because he did not}} want them to be so. In the 1980s, when superstitious beliefs prevented a majority of people from donating eyes, Rajinikanth took the case of campaigning in support of corneal transplantation via television and public speeches. In 2011, Rajinikanth announced <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> anti-corruption movement led by Gandhian Anna Hazare and offered his marriage hall, the Raghavendra Kalyana Mandapam, in Chennai free of cost for the India Against Corruption members to hold their fast. Rajinikanth's fan associations regularly organise blood donation and eye donation camps and distribute food during his birthday.|$|E
5|$|Black {{tried to}} remain {{positive}} in his race, {{and focused on}} national issues rather than defending Stanley's administration. He touted his support of President Woodrow Wilson and declared <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> United States' admission into the League of Nations. His support of Wilson hurt him with German American voters, and Wilson's handling of recent coal strikes hurt Black with the traditionally Democratic labor vote.|$|E

5|$|Early in his {{political}} career, Piłsudski became {{a leader of}} the Polish Socialist Party. Concluding that Poland's independence would have to be won by force of arms, he created the Polish Legions. In 1914 he anticipated the outbreak of a European war, the Russian Empire's defeat by the Central Powers, and the Central Powers' defeat by the western powers. When World War I broke out, he and his Legions fought under Austrian army control against Russia. In 1917, with Russia faring badly in the war, he withdrew <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Central Powers and was arrested by the Germans.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of his rule, Basiliscus showed <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Miaphysites. Zacharias Scholasticus reports how a group of Egyptian Miaphysite monks, having heard of Emperor Leo's death, had moved from Alexandria to Constantinople to petition Zeno in favour of Timothy, but at their arrival in the capital, they found the newly elected Basiliscus instead. The Magister Officiorum Theoctistus, the former physician of Basiliscus, was the brother of one of the monks, so the delegation obtained an audience with Basiliscus, and, with the support of Theoctistus and of the Empress, they convinced Basiliscus to recall from exile the banished Miaphysite Patriarchs.|$|E
5|$|McCain had {{fundraising}} {{problems in}} the first half of 2007, due in part to <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was unpopular among the Republican base electorate. Large-scale campaign staff downsizing took place in early July, but McCain said that he was not considering dropping out of the race. Later that month, the candidate's campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed. McCain slumped badly in national polls, often running third or fourth with 15percent or less support.|$|E

5|$|On 2 April 1627 Koniecpolski {{managed to}} {{recapture}} Puck. He took Czarne (Hamersztyn) on 18 April {{and forced the}} Swedish forces to retreat into the city. A week later they surrendered, with many mercenaries and some Swedish abandoning their banners and insignia, and changing sides. As {{a result of the}} series of Swedish defeats in spring 1627, they lost all their strongholds on {{the west bank of the}} Vistula, and with those, their hopes for a quick and decisive victory. The situation also convinced the Elector of Brandenburg to declare <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth, and afterwards the Lithuanian forces resumed their offensive in Livonia.|$|E
5|$|Sutton's goal of £1,000,000 {{was reached}} on 23 April 2014, and on 2 May, he was {{discharged}} from the hospital following an improvement in his condition. Later that same day he also met with prime minister David Cameron, who voiced <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> campaign. On 4 May, Sutton helped break the Guinness World Record for 'The most number of people making heart-shaped hand gestures', with 554 people at Chase Terrace Technology College.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill passed}} the House and Senate quickly and was made law on March 19, 1816. But, the measure proved {{extremely}} unpopular with voters, {{in part because}} it applied to the current Congress. Many legislators who supported the bill lost their congressional seats as a result, including Johnson's colleague Solomon P. Sharp from Kentucky. Johnson's popularity in other matters helped him retain his seat. Two days into the next session, he recanted <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> law. It was repealed in that session, and in its place, legislators passed an increase in the per diem salary.|$|E

5|$|The {{increasing}} Muslim {{support for}} Gandhi, after he championed the Caliph's cause, temporarily stopped the Hindu-Muslim communal violence. It offered evidence of inter-communal harmony in joint Rowlatt satyagraha demonstration rallies, raising Gandhi's stature {{as the political}} leader to the British. <b>His</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Khilafat movement also helped him sideline Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who had announced {{his opposition to the}} satyagraha non-cooperation movement approach of Gandhi. Jinnah began creating his independent support, and later went on to lead the demand for West and East Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|The union, {{the city}} Labour {{establishment}} and the Bishop of Bristol, Oliver Stratford Tomkins, ignored Stephenson {{and tried to}} work with Bill Smith of the TGWU to resolve the dispute. Learie Constantine continued with <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> campaign, meeting with the Lord Mayor of Bristol and Frank Cousins, leader of the Transport and General Workers Union. In addition, {{he went to the}} Bristol Omnibus Company's parent, the Transport Holding Company, and persuaded them to send officials to talk with the union. The company chairman told Constantine that racial discrimination was not company policy.|$|E
5|$|With his {{judgments}} on war pensions {{and his role}} in the enquiry into the Profumo Affair, Denning became possibly the best-known judge ever to belong to the English judiciary, with the public treating Lord Denning and the Court of Appeal as synonymous. He was equally well-loved and controversial, appreciated for his role as 'the people's judge' and <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> common man and disliked by elements of the bar and judiciary for 'uncertainty in the law' created by his broad judgments.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, Pat Califia said {{politics}} {{played an}} important role in the gay community's rejection of NAMBLA. Califia has since completely repudiated <b>his</b> earlier <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> association.|$|R

5|$|After a long {{absence from}} politics, Marshall {{was called to}} one final act of public service. Upon the death of Martin D. Hardin who had been elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1823 but died before he could take office, Marshall pursued an {{abbreviated}} campaign for the vacant seat and defeated Jeptha Dudley {{by a margin of}} 3 votes. The primary issue of the day was the Old Court – New Court controversy, an attempt by the legislature to abolish the extant Court of Appeals {{and replace it with a}} new court in retaliation for overturning a replevin law passed in a previous legislative session. Marshall enjoyed a higher level of support in this election by virtue of <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Old Court, which was the prevailing sentiment in his district. His actions in the session, however, appear to have been unremarkable, and he did not seek reelection at the end of his term.|$|E
5|$|After {{his early}} {{release from prison}} for {{political}} crimes in 1924, over {{the second half of}} the 1920s, Gandhi continued to pursue swaraj. He pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928 calling on the British government to grant India dominion status or face a new campaign of non-co-operation with complete independence for the country as its goal. After <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> World War I with Indian combat troops, and the failure of Khilafat movement in preserving the rule of Caliph in Turkey, followed by a collapse in Muslim support for his leadership, some such as Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh questioned his values and non-violent approach. While many Hindu leaders championed a demand for immediate independence, Gandhi revised his own call to a one-year wait, instead of two.|$|E
5|$|Durham's {{location}} in the north left it insecure, as Malcolm Canmore, King of Scots, raided and invaded the north of England {{on a number of}} occasions. Malcolm claimed Northumbria, in which Durham was located, as part of his kingdom. St-Calais managed to befriend Malcolm, and secured <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> patron saint of Durham, Saint Cuthbert. Malcolm and his wife helped lay the foundation stone of the new cathedral dedicated to Cuthbert. Respect for the saint did not mean that Malcolm refrained entirely from raiding the north; he was killed in 1093 while once more raiding Northumbria. Both the English king and St-Calais did all in their power to support Malcolm's sons, who had been educated in England, in their attempts to secure the Scottish throne.|$|E
