25|$|The Industrial Revolution brought many {{concerns}} about the deteriorating working and living conditions of urban workers. Influenced by the German Bishop Wilhelm Emmanuel Freiherr von Ketteler, in 1891 Pope Leo XIII published the encyclical Rerum novarum, which set in context Catholic social teaching <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> rejected socialism but advocated the regulation of working conditions.

25|$|Helen Cooper of Cambridge University {{writes that}} because Guy Earl of Warwick {{would be a}} work of extreme juvenilia for Ben Jonson, and also {{possibly}} a revision of a still older play, Jonson's involvement cannot be discounted. Cooper notes that in Jonson's 1632 play The Magnetic Lady, Jonson describes his ideally bad play <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> correspond well to the plot of Guy Earl of Warwick, and suggests the possibility that Jonson was, in fact, criticizing his own primitive work.|$|E
25|$|Some {{classes of}} matroid have been defined from {{well-known}} families of graphs, by phrasing a characterization of these graphs <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> make sense more generally for matroids. These include the bipartite matroids, {{in which every}} circuit is even, and the Eulerian matroids, which can be partitioned into disjoint circuits. A graphic matroid is bipartite {{if and only if}} it comes from a bipartite graph and a graphic matroid is Eulerian if and only if it comes from an Eulerian graph. Within the graphic matroids (and more generally within the binary matroids) these two classes are dual: a graphic matroid is bipartite if and only if its dual matroid is Eulerian, and a graphic matroid is Eulerian if and only if its dual matroid is bipartite.|$|E
25|$|John Small (19 April 1737, Empshott, Hampshire – 31 December 1826, Petersfield, Hampshire) was an English {{professional}} cricketer {{who played}} in important matches from c.1756 to 1798, {{one of the longest}} careers on record. He is generally regarded as the greatest batsman of the 18th century and was the first to master the use of the modern straight bat which was introduced in the 1760s. He scored the earliest known century in important cricket and was acclaimed as the greatest player of the famous Hambledon Club. In 1997, he was named by The Times as one of its 100 Greatest Cricketers of All Time. He is the first person known to have been described in literature <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> attest him to have been a superstar. He was a very influential player who was involved in the creation of two significant permanent additions to the Laws of Cricket: the maximum width of the bat and the introduction of the middle stump.|$|E

25|$|The Indonesian Air Force is {{headquartered}} in Jakarta, Indonesia. Its Order of Battle is {{split into two}} Air Force Operational Commands ("KOOPSAU") (east and west regions). Most of its airbases are located {{on the island of}} Java. In addition, the Air Force also manages the National Air Defence Command ("KOHANUDNAS"), <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> its commander is always an Air Force two-star Marshal; however, its operational command falls directly under the Commander of TNI (due {{to the fact that the}} Command's subordinate units come from all TNI services which have air defense capabilities). In 1946, Indonesia became the second country (after Thailand/Siam) in South East Asia to acquire an Air Force capability, with the formation of the Indonesian Air Force. Presently, the Indonesian Air Force has up-to 34,930 personnel equipped with 510 aircraft including Su-27s, Su-30 fighters, A-4E Skyhawks, Northrop F-5s, F-16, KAI T-50 Golden Eagle. The Indonesian Air Force also has a formation of special operation forces which is known as Paskhas that are tasked for Infantry-like purposes and special quick reaction capabilities.|$|E
25|$|Objectification theory {{suggests}} both {{direct and indirect}} consequences of objectification to women. Indirect consequences include self consciousness <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> a woman is consistently checking or rearranging her clothes or appearance to ensure that she is presentable. More direct consequences are related to sexual victimization. Rape and sexual harassment are examples of this. Doob (2012) states that sexual harassment {{is one of the}} challenges faced by women in workplace. This may constitute sexual jokes or comments, most of which are degrading. Research indicates that objectification theory is valuable to understanding how repeated visual images in the media are socialized and translated into mental health problems, including psychological consequences on the individual and societal level. These include increased self-consciousness, increased body anxiety, heightened mental health threats (depression, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and sexual dysfunction), and increased body shame. Therefore, the theory has been used to explore an array of dependent variables including disordered eating, mental health, depression, motor performance, body image, idealized body type, stereotype formation, sexual perception and sexual typing. Body shame is a byproduct of the concept of an idealized body type adopted by most Western cultures that depicts a thin, model-type figure. Thus, women will engage in actions meant to change their body such as dieting, exercise, eating disorders, cosmetic surgery, etc. Effects of objectification theory are identified on both the individual and societal levels.|$|E

500|$|The 1950s and 1960s were {{a time of}} {{disappointment}} for Vaughan, in which she sought unsuccessfully to have earlier work re-issued. In 1957 she visited the West Indies with Charles, as it was thought the climate might benefit his ailing health. However, the visit proved ineffectual, and he died the following year. Her own health being also affected, Vaughan would publish no more novels, and only minimal writing {{for the remainder of}} her life. Her final piece was an introduction to Thomas Traherne's Centuries published in 1960, in which she offers an account of her religious faith <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> are [...] "quasi-mystical". In 1963 she was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.|$|E
500|$|Marble Madness {{inspired}} {{other games}} that feature similar gameplay based on navigating a ball through progressively more difficult courses; such games are often described <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> relate them to Marble Madness. Melbourne House's Gyroscope and Electric Dreams Software's Spindizzy {{were the first}} such games; both met with a good reception. In 1990, Rare released Snake Rattle 'n' Roll, which incorporated elements similar to Marble Madness. The Super Monkey Ball series uses similar gameplay based on rolling a ball, but adds other features such as minigames and monkey characters. [...] Archer Maclean's Mercury also contains many elements similar to Marble Madness, but with minor variations, including the ability to change color, added hazards, and that the player controls a blob of liquid mercury rather than a marble.|$|E
500|$|By {{this time}} the enmity between Drusus and Sejanus had reached a {{critical}} point: Drusus had struck the prefect with his fist, and openly lamented that [...] "a stranger was invited {{to assist in the}} government while the emperor's son was alive". According to Levick, there is nothing to suggest bad relations between the two before this point, especially not as far back as 14, during their expedition to Pannonia. She says, however, {{it may have been the}} clash between theatrical claqueurs and the Praetorian Guard in 15 that began the quarrel, but not enough is known to say for certain. Of more concern to Drusus was, perhaps, that in 20 his father mentioned Sejanus to the Senate <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> treated him as his partner in power. For Drusus, the heir of that exact position, this was a legitimate cause for concern. [...] At the time, Tiberius was in his sixties, so there was a realistic possibility of Drusus succeeding his father in the near future. In the account of Tacitus, Sejanus began plotting against Drusus in secrecy to secure his position.|$|E
