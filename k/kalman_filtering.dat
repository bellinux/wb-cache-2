We have been tested the adaptive filter algorithms of simple <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter,</b> extended <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter,</b> rbfn <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter,</b> rbfn extended <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter,</b> fuzzy <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter</b> and fuzzy extended <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter</b> which might be considered applicable for wireless channel equalization in presence of noise. The <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter</b> {{is one of the most}} widely used due to its simplicity, optimality, tractability and robustness. However, the application of the KF to nonlinear systems can be difficult. The most common approach is to use the extended <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter.</b> We have shown that performance of the fuzzy extended <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter</b> is superior. More specifically, this paper highlights the error rate performance of the adaptive filters for channel equalization.

25|$|<b>Kalman</b> <b>filtering,</b> {{also known}} as linear {{quadratic}} estimation (LQE), is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, containing statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that {{tend to be more}} accurate than those based on a single measurement alone, by using Bayesian inference and estimating a joint probability distribution over the variables for each timeframe. The filter is named after Rudolf E. Kálmán, one of the primary developers of its theory.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} PID controllers were used and today are still {{used in the}} simpler DP systems. But modern controllers use a mathematical model of the ship {{that is based on}} a hydrodynamic and aerodynamic description concerning some of the ship's characteristics such as mass and drag. Of course, this model is not entirely correct. The ship's position and heading are fed into the system and compared with the prediction made by the model. This difference is used to update the model by using <b>Kalman</b> <b>filtering</b> technique. For this reason, the model also has input from the wind sensors and feedback from the thrusters. This method even allows not having input from any PRS for some time, depending {{on the quality of the}} model and the weather. This process is known as dead reckoning.|$|E

However, the extended <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter</b> is only a first-order approximation whereas the unscented version is accurate up to the second-order moment of the state distribution.

This <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter's</b> function is to estimate the current position of the target from a set of noisy measurements obtained by an antenna {{tracking system}}. The target under consideration is an earth orbiting satellite moving in an approximately circular orbit. Tracking is performed by an antenna system which consists of a radio frequency feed at the focus of a parabolic reflector.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter</b> is the minimum-variance state {{estimator}} for linear dynamic {{systems with}} Gaussian noise. Even if {{the noise is}} non-Gaussian, the <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter</b> is the best linear estimator. For nonlinear systems it is not possible, in general, to derive the optimal state estimator in closed form, but various modifications of the <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter</b> {{can be used to}} estimate the state. These modifications include the extended <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter,</b> the unscented <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter,</b> and the particle <b>filter.</b> Although the <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter</b> and its modifications are powerful tools for state estimation, we might have information about a system that the <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter</b> does not incorporate. For example, we may know that the states satisfy equality or inequality constraints. In this case we can modify the <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter</b> to exploit this additional information and get better filtering performance than the <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter</b> provides. This paper provides an overview of various ways to incorporate state constraints in the <b>Kalman</b> <b>filter</b> and its nonlinear modifications. If both the system and state constraints are linear, then all of these different approaches result in the same state estimate, which is the optimal constrained linear state estimate. If either the system or constraints are nonlinear, then constrained filtering is, in general, not optimal, and different approaches give different results. ...|$|R
