One of the 16 conditions yielded the most folded material for three out of the four proteins. Our results suggest that this protein folding screen will be generally useful in determining whether other proteins will fold in vitro and, if so, what factors are important.

Nonetheless, these conventional two-dimensional (2 D) or planar structured flexible energy storage devices could {{not meet the}} demand for wearable or textile electronics. To meet this demand, in this work, a novel flexible fiber hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) is fabricated using NiCo 2 O 4 nanograss (NG) -array coated carbon fiber (NiCo 2 O 4 NG@CF) as the positive electrode to provide a pseudocapacitance and porous carbon coated carbon fiber electrode as the negative electrode to provide an electric double-layer capacitance (EDLC). Particularly, the porous carbon is prepared from Lemon peel waste to obtain a low cost electrode material. Interestingly, the fabricated HSC exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 17. 5 F g- 1 (25. 03 mF cm- 2) and an energy density of 6. 61 Wh kg- 1 (9. 46 Î¼Wh cm- 2) at the current of 1 mA, which is far better than previous reports.

40|$|To {{understand}} how a protein folds and behaves inside living cells, the effects of synthetic crowding media on protein folding, function, stability, and association have been studied in detail. Because the effect of excluded volume is more prominent in an extended state than in the native protein, a majority of these {{studies have been conducted}} in the unfolded state of different model proteins. Here, we have used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and other biophysical methods to investigate the effect of crowding agents Ficoll 70 and Dextran 70 on the nativelike state of cytochrome c from yeast. Yeast cytochrome c (y-cytc) contains a substantial expanded state in its native <b>folded</b> <b>condition,</b> which is present in equilibrium with a compact conformer in aqueous buffer. We have found that the crowding medium affects the native state equilibrium between compact and expanded states, shifting its population toward the compact conformer. As a result, the peroxidase activity of y-cytc decreases. Urea-induced protein stability measurements show that the compaction destabilizes the protein due to charge repulsions between similar charged clusters. Interestingly, the time constant of conformational fluctuations between the compact and expanded conformers has been found to increase in the crowded milieu, suggesting a crucial role of the solution microviscosity...|$|E

It has a cylinder diameter of 5 m and a semi-cone angle of 200 for the boat-tail and nose cone portions. The overall height of the structure is 10. 65 m. In order to save structural mass and minimize fabrication time, the PLF is realized using sandwich construction with carbon/epoxy face sheets and aluminium honeycomb core and assembled with aluminium alloy interface rings at all the segment joints.

40|$|Using an {{elementary}} physical model for protein folding, of self-avoiding short copolymer chains on two-dimensional square lattices, we address two {{questions regarding the}} evolution and origins of globular proteins. (i) How will protein native structures and stabilities be affected by single-and double-site mutations? (ii) What is {{the probability that a}} randomly chosen sequence of amino acids will be compact and globular under <b>folding</b> <b>conditions?</b> For a large number of different sequences, we search the conformational space exhaustively to find unequivocally the "native" conformation(s), of global minimum free energy, for each sequence. We find that replacing nonpolar residues in the core by polar residues is generally destabilizing, that surface sites are less sensitive than core sites, that some mutations increase the degeneracy of native states, and that overall it is most probable that a mutation will be neutral, having no effect on the native structure. These results support a "Continuity Principle," that small changes in sequence seldom have large effects on structure or stability of the native state. The simulations also show that (i) the number of "convergent" sequences (different sequences coding for the same native structure) is extremely large and (ii) most sequences become quite dense under <b>folding</b> <b>conditions.</b> This implies that the probability of formation of a globular protein from a random sequence of amino acids by prebiotic or mutational methods is significantly greater than zero...|$|R

40|$|The {{survival}} and descent of cells is universally dependent on maintaining their proteins in a properly <b>folded</b> <b>condition.</b> It is widely accepted {{that the information}} for the folding of the nascent polypeptide chain into a native protein is encrypted in the amino acid sequence, and the Nobel Laureate Christian Anfinsen {{was the first to}} demonstrate that a protein could spontaneously refold after complete unfolding. However, {{it became clear that the}} observed folding rates for many proteins were much slower than rates estimated in vivo. This led to the recognition of required protein-protein interactions that promote proper folding. A unique group of proteins, the molecular chaperones, are responsible for maintaining protein homeostasis during normal growth as well as stress conditions. 	Chaperonins (CPNs) are ubiquitous and essential chaperones. They form ATP-dependent, hollow complexes that encapsulate polypeptides in two back-to-back stacked multisubunit rings, facilitating protein folding through highly cooperative allosteric articulation. CPNs are usually classified into Group I and Group II. Here, I report the characterization of a novel CPN belonging to a third Group, recently discovered in bacteria. Group III CPNs have close phylogenetic association to the Group II CPNs found in Archaea and Eukarya, and may be a relic of the Last Common Ancestor of the CPN family. 	The gene encoding the Group III CPN from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans and Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator was cloned in E. coli and overexpressed in order to both characterize the protein and to demonstrate its ability to function as an ATPase chaperone. The opening and closing cycle of the Chy chaperonin was examined via site-directed mutations affecting the ATP binding site at R 155. To relate the mutational analysis to the structure of the CPN, the crystal structure of both the AMP-PNP (an ATP analogue) and ADP bound forms were obtained in collaboration with Sun-Shin Cha in Seoul, South Korea. The ADP and ATP binding site substitutions resulted in frozen forms of the structures in open and closed conformations. From this, mutants were designed to validate hypotheses regarding key ATP interacting sites as well as important stabilizing interactions, and to observe the physical properties of the resulting complexes by calorimetry...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{proposed}} roles of the GroEL-GroES cavity is to provide an "infinite dilution" folding chamber where protein substrate can fold avoiding deleterious off-pathway aggregation. Support for this hypothesis has been strengthened {{by a number of}} studies that demonstrated a mandatory GroES requirement under nonpermissive solution conditions, i. e., the conditions where proteins cannot spontaneously fold. We have found that the refolding of glutamine synthetase (GS) does not follow this pattern. In the presence of natural osmolytes trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) or potassium glutamate, refolding GS monomers readily aggregate into very large inactive complexes and fail to reactivate even at low protein concentration. Surprisingly, under these "nonpermissive" <b>folding</b> <b>conditions,</b> GS can reactivate with GroEL and ATP alone and does not require the encapsulation by GroES. In contrast, the chaperonin dependent reactivation of GS under another nonpermissive condition of low Mg 2 + (< 2 mM MgCl 2) shows an absolute requirement of GroES. High-performance liquid chromatography gel filtration analysis and irreversible misfolding kinetics show that a major species of the GS folding intermediates, generated under these "low Mg 2 +" conditions exist as long-lived metastable monomers that can be reactivated after a significantly delayed addition of the GroEL. Our results indicate that the GroES requirement for refolding of GS is not simply dictated by the aggregation propensity of this protein substrate. Our data also suggest that the GroEL-GroES encapsulated environment is not required under all nonpermissive <b>folding</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R

For example, during online shopping, we can often infer material properties of clothing from images and judge how the material would feel against our skin. What visual information {{is important for}} tactile perception? Previous studies in material perception have focused on measuring surface appearance, such as gloss and roughness, and using verbal reports of material attributes and categories. However, in real life, predicting tactile properties of an object might not require accurate verbal descriptions of its surface attributes or categories. In this paper, we use tactile perception as ground truth to measure visual material perception. Using fabrics as our stimuli, we measure how observers match what they see (photographs of fabric samples) with what they feel (physical fabric samples). The data shows that color has {{a significant main effect}} in that removing color significantly reduces accuracy, especially when the images contain 3 -D folds. We also find that images of draped fabrics, which revealed 3 -D shape information, achieved better matching accuracy than images with flattened fabrics. The data shows a strong interaction between color and <b>folding</b> <b>conditions</b> on matching accuracy, suggesting that, in 3 -D <b>folding</b> <b>conditions,</b> the visual system takes advantage of chromatic gradients to infer tactile properties but not in flattened conditions.

Current experimental knowledge comes primarily from thermodynamic measurements in solution or {{the structures of}} individual molecules, elucidated by either x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. From the former, we know the enthalpy, entropy, and free energy differences between the folded and unfolded forms of hundreds of proteins {{under a variety of}} solvent/cosolvent conditions. From the latter, we know the structures of â 35, 000 proteins, which are built on scaffolds of hydrogen-bonded structural elements, Î±-helix and Î²-sheet. Anfinsen showed that the amino acid sequence alone is sufficient to determine a protein's structure, but the molecular mechanism responsible for self-assembly remains an open question, probably the most fundamental open question in biochemistry. This perspective is a hybrid: partly review, partly proposal. First, we summarize key ideas regarding protein folding developed over the past half-century and culminating in the current mindset. In this view, the energetics of side-chain interactions dominate the folding process, driving the chain to self-organize under <b>folding</b> <b>conditions.</b> Next, having taken stock, we propose an alternative model that inverts the prevailing side-chain/backbone paradigm.

40|$|A {{key problem}} in {{experimental}} protein folding {{is that of}} characterizing the conformational ensemble of denatured proteins under <b>folding</b> <b>conditions.</b> We address this problem by studying the conformational propensities of reductively unfolded RNase A under <b>folding</b> <b>conditions,</b> since earlier work has indicated that the equilibrium conformational ensemble of fully reduced RNase A resembles the transient conformational ensemble of a burst-phase folding intermediate of disulfide-intact RNase A. To assess these propensities, the relative disulfide-bond populations of the 1 S, 2 S, and 3 S ensembles of the [C 40 A,C 95 A] mutant of RNase A were measured. Thirteen of the fifteen possible disulfide bonds are observed, consistent with earlier results and with the rapid reshuffling and lack of stable tertiary structure in these ensembles. This broad distribution contradicts recent observations by another group, but rigorous cross-checks show unambiguously that our data are self-consistent whereas their data are not. The distributions of disulfide bonds in the wild-type and mutant proteins show a power-law dependence on loop length, with an exponent that is significantly smaller than the exponents of either ideal or excluded-volume polymers. The 65 - 72 disulfide bond is much more strongly favored than would be predicted by this power law, consistent with earlier peptide studies and the disulfide-bond distributions of the 1 S and 2 S ensembles in wild-type RNase A. Experimental evidence suggests that this preference results from conformational biases in the backbone, rather than from differing accessibilities or reactivities of the two cysteine residues. In general, the other disulfide species do not deviate significantly from the power-law dependence, indicating that the conformational biases are relatively weak...|$|R

The effect of solvent conditions (i. e., the denaturant concentration and the protein concentration) on the folding and aggregation behavior of a system of simple, two-dimensional lattice protein molecules has been investigated via (dynamic Monte Carlo simulations. The population profiles and aggregation propensities of the nine most populated intermediate configurations exhibit a complex dependence on the solution conditions that can be understood by considering the competition between intra- and interchain interactions. Some of these configurations are not even seen in isolated chain simulations; they are observed to be highly aggregation prone and are stabilized primarily by the aggregation reaction in multiple-chain systems. Aggregation arises from the association of partially folded intermediates rather than from the association of denatured random-coil states.

40|$|Background: Although small {{proteins}} may fold in {{an apparent}} two-state manner, most studies of protein folding reveal transient intermediates. The âmolten globuleâ has been proposed to be a general intermediate in protein folding. Relatively {{little is known about}} the structure of partially folded intermediates, however. Results: Three different partially folded intermediates of apomyoglobin, having 35 %, 50 % and 60 % helix, were characterized at low pH in the presence of different anions. It was found that increasing helical structure correlated with decreasing size and increasing stability to urea. Similar intermediates have been observed transiently during the folding of apomyoglobin. Conclusions: The results are consistent with a model for folding in which structural units coalesce to form a core of relatively native-like structure, the remainder of the protein being relatively disordered. For a given protein there will be certain partially folded conformations of particularly low free energy that are preferentially populated under both equilibrium and transient <b>folding</b> <b>conditions.</b> The conformation and topology of the intermediates will be specific to a given protein, so there are no âgeneralâ intermediates, such as the molten globule, in folding...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{production}} of newly synthesized proteins {{is a key}} process of protein homeostasis that initiates the biosyn-thetic flux of proteins and thereby determines the composition, stability and functionality of the proteome. Protein synthe-sis is highly regulated on multiple levels to adapt the proteome to environmental and physiological challenges such as ag-ing and proteotoxic conditions. Imbalances of protein <b>folding</b> <b>conditions</b> are sensed by the cell that then trigger a cascade of signaling pathways aiming to restore the protein folding equilibrium. One regulatory node to rebalance proteostasis upon stress is the control of protein synthesis itself. Translation is reduced as an immediate response to perturbations of the protein folding equilibrium that {{can be observed in}} the cytosol {{as well as in the}} organelles such as the endoplasmatic reticulum and mitochondria. As reduction of protein synthesis is linked to life span increase, the signaling pathways regu-lating protein synthesis might be putative targets for treatments of age-related diseases.

The H 4 tail was shown to not greatly affect the nucleosome conformation, but did slightly influence the relative population of the preferred conformation. The role of the H 4 tail varied depending on the valency and ionic strength, suggesting that electrostatic forces play a primary role in H 4 tail interactions. Interestingly, despite the H 4 tailâs lack of influence, when H 3 and H 4 tails were simultaneously clipped, a more dramatic effect was seen than when only H 3 or H 4 tails were clipped. The combinatorial effect of H 3 and H 4 tail truncation suggests a potential mechanism by which various combinations of histone tail modifications can be used to control accessibility of DNA-binding proteins to nucleosomal DNA...|$|R

These observations firmly establish that amyloid formation and protein folding represent two fundamentally different ways of organizing polypeptides into ordered conformations.

We describe how the linear scalability of OCFS allows rapid process optimization of parameters affecting extract activation, gene sequence optimization, and redox <b>folding</b> <b>conditions</b> for disulfide bond formation at microliter scales. Efficient and predictable high-level protein production can then be achieved using batch processes in standard bioreactors. We show how a fully bioactive protein produced by OCFS from optimized frozen extract can be purified directly using a streamlined purification process that yields a biologically active cytokine, human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, produced at titers of 700 mg/L in 10 h. These results represent a milestone for in vitro protein synthesis, with potential for the cGMP production of disulfide-bonded biotherapeutic proteins. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2011; 108 : 1570 â 1578.

40|$|We {{investigated}} how {{the folding}} yield of disulfide-containing globular proteins having positive net charges from crude bacterial inclusion bodies {{was affected by}} additives in the folding buffer. In screening <b>folding</b> <b>conditions</b> for human ribonucleases and its derivative, we found that addition of salt (about 0. 4 M) to a folding buffer increased the folding yield. This suggested that electrostatic interaction between polyanionic impuri-ties such as nucleic acids and cationic unfolded protein {{led to the formation}} of aggre-gates under the low-salt conditions. Since inclusion bodies were found to contain nucleic acids regardless of the electrostatic nature of the expressed protein, the electro-static interaction between phosphate moieties of nucleic acids and basic amino acid res-idues of a denatured protein may be large enough to cause aggregation, and therefore the addition of salt in a folding buffer may generally be useful for promotion of protein folding from crude inclusion bodies. We further systematically investigated additives such as glycerol, guanidium chloride, and urea that are known to act as chemical chap-erons, and found that these additives, together with salt, synergistically improved fold-ing yield. This study, suggesting that the addition of salt into the folding buffer is one o...|$|R
30|$|All {{cells and}} tissues produce {{higher levels of}} HSPs under high temperatures. Stress {{inducible}} proteins like HSP 70 work as molecular chaperons that safe guard cells and organisms as they keep cellular proteins in a competent <b>folding</b> <b>condition</b> to prevent the aggregation of irreversible proteins and help in the refolding of proteins damaged by the stress (Gabriel et al. 2001). While the main role of HSPs is to prevent and reverse the damage to proteins, the antioxidant enzymes decrease oxidation and prevent oxidative damage. Hyperthermia produces oxidative stress and increases the production of ROS (Robert et al. 2017) which results in the induction of the expression of HSP 70 (Zhang et al. 2006). The major role of antioxidants {{is to reduce the}} free radicals and prevent the lipid peroxidation that protects cells from ROS (Nanari et al. 2004; Grashorn, 2007). The antioxidants are either enzymatic or non-enzymatic. Superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase are enzymatic antioxidants whereas, lipid-soluble vitamins (E and A), pro-vitamin A (beta-carotene) and water-soluble vitamin C are non-enzymatic antioxidants. Low plasma concentration of antioxidant vitamins (C and E, and folic acid) and minerals (Se and Zn) are negatively correlated with high damage caused by oxidation in poultry reared under stress conditions (Sahin et al. 2002).|$|R
40|$|Small {{heat shock}} {{proteins}} (sHsps) are a conserved and ubiquitous protein family. Their ability to convey thermoresistance suggests {{their participation in}} protecting the native conformation of proteins. However, the underlying functional principles of their protective properties and their role in concert with other chaperone families remain enigmatic. Here, we analysed the influence of Hsp 25 on the inactivation and subsequent aggregation of a model protein, citrate synthase (CS), under heat shock conditions in vitro. We show that stable binding of several non-native CS molecules to one Hsp 25 oligomer leads to an accumulation of CS unfolding intermediates, which are protected from irreversible aggregation. Furthermore, {{a number of different}} proteins which bind to Hsp 25 can be isolated from heat-shocked extracts of cells. Under permissive <b>folding</b> <b>conditions,</b> CS can be released from Hsp 25 and, in cooperation with Hsp 70, an ATP-dependent chaperone, the native state can be restored. Taken together, our findings allow us to integrate sHsps functionally in the cellular chaperone system operating under heat shock conditions. The task of sHsps in this context is to efficiently trap a large number of unfolding proteins in a folding-competent state and thus create a reservoir of non-native proteins {{for an extended period of}} time, allowing refolding after restoration of physiological conditions in cooperation with other chaperones...|$|R
