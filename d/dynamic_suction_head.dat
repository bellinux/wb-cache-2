The experiment revealed maximum suction pressure and velocity when {{the distance from the}} <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> to the bed was about 25 % of <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> diameter. <b>Suction</b> pressure decreased rapidly as the distance from the <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> to the bed increased to 50 % and 100 % of <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> diameter. <b>Suction</b> pressure achieved by wedge-type <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> was only 16. 9 - 17. 6 % of that around plain-type <b>suction</b> <b>head,</b> and the velocity around wedge-type <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> was 64. 7 - 68. 4 % of that around plain-type <b>suction</b> <b>head.</b> However the plain-type <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> was easily clogged doe to its long bobbing period. The average bobbing period for the plain-type <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> was about 105 - 263 % that of the wedge-type <b>suction</b> <b>head.</b> The sediment removal efficiency was achieved when float tank diameter was 3 - 4 times that of the <b>suction</b> <b>head.</b> Flow discharge and sediment removal increased as the <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> diameter and side hole diameter increased, respectively.

40|$|The {{cavitation}} {{performance of}} an {{axial flow pump}} with inlet guide vanes for different flow rates is studied in this article. The effects of inlet guide vanes on pump hydraulic performance and cavitation are investigated, where the total vapor fraction of impeller zone (Ftv) is calculated to predict the critical net positive <b>suction</b> <b>head,</b> which is compared with that predicted by efficiency criterion for different flow rates. The influences {{of the development of}} cavitation on internal flow in impeller zone are also investigated. The results obtained show that the cavitation performance of axial flow pump can be improved at off-design flow conditions by adjusting angles of inlet guide vanes to positive values at low flow rates and by regulating angles of inlet guide vanes to negative values at high flow rates. As the net positive <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> decreases, the vapor fraction first increases slowly and then increases greatly, clearly presenting cavitation process from inception to full development, which can be used to predict the required net positive <b>suction</b> <b>head.</b> When net positive <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> decreases to the value around required net positive <b>suction</b> <b>head,</b> the cavitation zone from tip of blade suction side close to leading edge and the cavitation zone from hub part of the blade suction side connect together.

40|$|NoThis paper {{presents}} {{results of}} the relationship between the degree of saturation and the matric <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> at static equilibrium and during dynamic flow of water using a Buchner funnel and a fully instrumented two-dimensional tank, respectively. The major influences of the dynamic flow on the relationships between the <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> and the degree of saturation are highlighted and discussed. The experimental results show that dynamic flow of water strongly affects the volume of entrapped air. The results also reveal that any scanning curve can be described as two parts, namely, transition and coinciding. The transition curve starts from the recent reversal degree of saturation and continues up to the previous reversal degree of saturation. The shape of the transition curve and the amount of hysteresis are not only a function of the reversal degree of saturation but are also a function of the saturation path history. The experimental results are used to examine the validity of the proposed analytical model by Parker and Lenhard in 1987 for describing the relationships between the degree of saturation and the matric <b>suction</b> <b>head.</b> It was found that Parker and Lenhard¿s model provides a good prediction of the relations provided that care should be taken for the value of the reversal degree of saturation at zero <b>suction</b> <b>head...</b>|$|R

40|$|Around {{the third}} week after {{gestation}} in embryonic development, the human heart consists only of a valvless tube, unlike a fully developed adult heart, which is multi-chambered. At this stage in development, the heart valves have not formed and so net flow of blood through the heart must be driven by a different mechanism. It is hypothesized {{that there are two}} possible mechanisms that drive blood flow at this stage - Liebau pumping (<b>dynamic</b> <b>suction</b> pumping or valveless pumping) and peristaltic pumping. We implement the immersed boundary method with adaptive mesh refinement (IBAMR) to numerically study the effect of hematocrit on the circulation around a valveless.

In the case of <b>dynamic</b> <b>suction</b> pumping, the heart and circulatory system is simplified as a flexible tube attached to a relatively rigid racetrack.

This paper presents a theoretical model for the prediction of the incipient of cavitation in centrifugal pumps. The model includes the physical fluid parameters and the real working phenomena at off-design condition. The parameters considered in the model were flow rate ratio, pump rational speed, water temperature, thermodynamic properties of water, nuclei and gas content, relative velocity and incidence angle. The thermodynamic effect had a more complex expression compared with other parameters. The present model has been tested against extensive earlier published experimental results in centrifugal pumps at wide operating conditions.

However, the test alone might not reflect the leakage rate under different levels of vacuum. To study the characteristics of leakage through exhalation valves, a leakage meter was built to measure the leakage rate of four brands of exhalation valves. Seven valves of each brand were tested for leakage rate at pressure drops ranging from 15 to 45 mmH 2 O (or extended to 75 mmH 2 O for some valves). Two types of leaks, i. e. fiber insertion and arch dent on the valve seat, were used to investigate the effect of leak shape on the characteristic leak flow {{as a function of}} pressure drop. A leakage data point represented a mean value of five measurements. The results showed that the leakage rate could increase or decrease with increasing pressure drop inside the respirators, indicating that the current method of conducting leakage tests, at a constant <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> of 25 mmH 2 O, does not guarantee better protection than when the respirators are used at a lower <b>suction</b> <b>head.</b> Moreover, based on the sample valves tested in this study, it was found that valve leakage wasmostly caused by defects in the valve seats.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new laboratory dataset on the moisture-pressure relationship above a dispersive groundwater wave in a two-dimensional vertical unconfined sand flume aquifer driven by simple harmonic forcing. A total of five experiments {{were conducted in}} which all experimental parameters were kept constant except for the oscillation period, which ranged from 268 s to 2449 s between tests. Moisture content and <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> sensor pairings were co-located at two locations in the unsaturated zone both approximately 0. 2 m above the mean watertable elevation and respectively 0. 3 m and 0. 75 m from the driving head boundary. For all oscillation periods except for the shortest (T= 268 s), {{the formation of a}} hysteretic moisture-pressure scanning loop was observed. Consistent with the decay of the saturated zone groundwater wave, the size of the observed moisture-pressure scanning loops decayed with increasing distance landward and the decay rate is larger for the shorter oscillation periods. At the shortest period (T= 268 s), the observed moisture-pressure relationship was observed to be non-hysteretic but with a capillary capacity that differs from that of the static equilibrium wetting and drying curves. This finding is consistent with observations from existing one-dimensional vertical sand column experiments. The relative damping of the moisture content with distance landward is higher than that for the <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> consistent with the fact that transmission of pressure through a porous medium occurs more readily than mass transfer. This is further supported by the fact that observed phase lags for the unsaturated zone variables (i. e. <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> and moisture content) relative to the driving head are greater than the saturated zone variables (i. e. piezometric head). Harmonic analysis of the data reveals no observable generation of higher harmonics in either moisture or pressure despite the strongly non-linear relationship between the two. In addition, a phase lag of moisture content relative to the <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> was observed indicating that the response time of the moisture content to watertable motion is greater than that of the pore water pressure. The observed moisture-pressure dynamics are qualitatively reproduced using a hysteretic Richards’ equation model.

Information about infiltration at a site may be to evaluate surface irrigation systems, to predict hydrologic conditions, and to solve many other problems (Ojha, et al., 2017). This thesis project is based on my engineering capstone project, which is to design a solution to control erosion in the soil bed adjacent to Henry V Events. There is erosion in the soil bed due to stormwater runoff from the roof, and due to the sloped soil bed which encourages the overland flow. The objective of this thesis is to estimate the infiltration rates and potentials at the site for a six year, four hour storm event using the Green-Ampt and Philip models. This will determine if only the soil bed slope can be changed to prevent erosion, or if soil bed improvements should ensue. The most conservative estimate was calculated using the Philip model and resulted in an infiltration rate of 0. 77 cm/hr and an infiltration potential of 4. 27 cm.
