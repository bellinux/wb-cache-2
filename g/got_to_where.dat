25|$|In April 2012, Dark Horse began {{releasing}} a second eight-issue limited series entitled Falling Skies: The Battle of Fitchburg, with Paul Tobin returning as writer and Juan Ferreyra returning as series artist. The digital comic was made available through both Dark Horse Comics and TNT via their respective websites. The story takes place chronologically between seasons {{one and two}} of the television show, and details a costly engagement occurring between the skitters and the 2nd Massachusetts Militia Regiment when the aliens surround the human forces at Fitchburg, Massachusetts. While not vital to the story of the television series, TNT and Dark Horse have stated that Falling Skies: The Battle of Fitchburg provides insight into the events leading up to season two, and will elaborate on how the characters <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> they are when the new season opens. As a companion to the comic, TNT released an audio series featuring the character John Pope, offering additional insight into the events detailed in the comic series.|$|E

The accountants searched {{for new ways to}} save the company money, including capitalizing on loopholes found in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the accounting industry's standards. One Enron accountant revealed [...] "We tried to aggressively use the literature [...] to our advantage. All the rules create all these opportunities.

500|$|Typically, {{there were}} two dog {{trainers}} on the set, each teetering on a stepladder only Lassie could see and waving a chunk of meat at the dog. [...] "It would look as though Lassie was looking at Jon (Provost), but he was really looking past Jon at the piece of beef", Lockhart recalled in 2004. When Provost delivered his line, the trainer behind Lockhart would whisper [...] "Lassie!" [...] and wave another piece of meat. Lassie's head would turn to Lockhart who would deliver her line. Then the trainer behind Provost would get Lassie's attention again, and Provost would deliver his next line. [...] "The sound editor would cut out all that," [...] Lockhart said, [...] "You finally <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> you never heard the trainers. Often, if the scene had gone well, and maybe we hadn't gotten the dialogue quite right, if the dog was right, they'd print it." [...] In addition to the main Lassie, three other Lassies might be involved in an episode shoot: a stand-in for rehearsals, a stunt double, and a [...] "fighter" [...] for scenes involving battles with other animals.|$|E

Bissix has said, [...] "Myself, Diederick [...] and [...] Dominic [...] had a characterisation session and we discussed what Clare's been doing and how she's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> she is now.

2500|$|Tillman Johnson said, [...] "Whenever he {{came down}} the stairs from his hotel room, he called for the press. He was a showman. He was a {{handsome}} man, I'd say, {{and he made a}} good appearance and of course he had a reputation for being a killer. So the press all followed Gonzaullas." [...] He also said, [...] "No, he didn't do any real police work himself. He'd get in that car and ride around, {{ask a lot of questions}} about what the other officers had found then he'd release it to the press like it was his information. It <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> after a while some officers wouldn't tell him anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Other Indians came to {{us after}} we got {{most of the men}} at the ravine. We all kept after them until they <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> Custer was. There was only a few of them left then. By that time all the Indians in the village got their horses and guns and watched Custer. When Custer got nearly to {{the lower end of the}} camp. he started to go down a gulch, but the Indians were {{surrounding}} him, and he tried to fight. They got off their horses and made a stand but it was no use. Their horses ran down the ravine right into the village. The squaws caught them as fast as they came. One of them was a sorrel with white stocking. Long time after some of our relatives told us that they had seen Custer on that kind of horse when he was on the way to the Big Horn." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 2014, during PAX Australia, Bethesda officially {{cancelled}} Prey 2. Hines stated, [...] "It {{was a game}} {{we believed}} in, but we never felt that it <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> {{it needed to be}} –– we never saw a path to success if we finished it. It wasn't up to our quality standard, and we decided to cancel it. It’s no longer in development. That wasn't an easy decision, but it’s one that won’t surprise many folks given that we hadn't been talking about it. Human Head Studios is no longer working on it. It's a franchise we still believe we can do something with — we just need to see what that something is." [...] Tim Gerritsen, business development director at Human Head Studios, said, [...] "While we are disappointed that we won’t be able to deliver our vision of the game, we remain proud of our work on the franchise, which we feel speaks for itself, including the award-winning presentation of the game at E3 2011. We enjoyed working with the many talented people at Bethesda, and we wish them all the best of luck with any future plans they may have for the franchise." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{commentators}} {{have said that}} the harassment associated with Gamergate springs from this existing well of deep-seated misogyny, and that it was merely brought to the fore by the anonymity of the Internet. Regarding the false allegations against Quinn, Amanda Marcotte in an article for The Daily Beast accused the video game world of being [...] "thick with misogynists who are aching to swarm" [...] with hate on any [...] "random woman held up for them to hate, no matter what the pretext". She related these attacks to harassment sent to a woman who criticized a Teen Titans cover and to a community manager of the Mighty No. 9 game because she drew a feminine Mega Man, and virtual rapes committed against women's player avatars in Grand Theft Auto V and DayZ. In an interview with the BBC, Quinn stated that [...] "Before [...] had a name, it was nothing but {{trying to get me to}} kill myself, trying to get people to hurt me, going after my family. ... There is no mention of ethics in journalism at all outside of making the same accusation everybody makes towards any successful woman; that clearly she <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> she is because she had sex with someone." [...] Danielle Citron of the University of Maryland wrote that the intent of this type of harassment is to demean the victim, make them doubt their own integrity, and to redefine the victim's identity in order to [...] "fundamentally distort who she is".|$|E
