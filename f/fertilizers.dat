40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the effectiveness of <b>fertilizer</b> subsidy on paddy cultivation. ANCOVA model was fitted in order to accomplish this objective. Accordingly, it was found that there is a statistically significant positive relationship between <b>fertilizer</b> subsidy and average yield of paddy farming. Marginal Analysis was employed in order to assess the efficiency of <b>fertilizer</b> usage. According to the analysis, private benefits of <b>fertilizer</b> usage are higher than private cost; hence, <b>fertilizer</b> usage is inefficient; more precisely <b>fertilizer</b> is underutilized. On the contrary, as evidence shows social cost of <b>fertilizer</b> usage is higher than social benefits; <b>fertilizer</b> usage is inefficient but over utilized. Hence, appropriate measures should be taken up in order to reduce <b>fertilizer</b> usage. This dilemma should be handled very carefully. Since evidence has established that <b>fertilizer</b> usage is encouraged by <b>fertilizer</b> subsidy, it is suggested to reconsider the mechanism of <b>fertilizer</b> subsidy instead of removing it...|$|R
