These gaskets generally have a much higher level of quality control than sheet gaskets and generally can withstand much higher temperatures and pressures. The key downside is that a solid metal must be greatly compressed {{in order to become}} flush with the <b>flange</b> <b>head</b> and prevent leakage. The material choice is more difficult; because metals are primarily used, process contamination and oxidation are risks. An additional downside is that the metal used must be softer than the flange [...] - [...] {{in order to ensure that}} the flange does not warp and thereby prevent sealing with future gaskets.

40|$|Abstract. In the {{construction}} of composite bridge structures, various types of shear connectors are usually used to provide an efficient load transfer and the composite action {{of two or more}} different materials. In the previous work conducted by authors, a new type of the shear connector was introduced, which is the perforated shear connector with <b>flange</b> <b>heads</b> (T-shaped perforated shear connector), and the structural behavior of the shear connector was discussed {{based on the results of}} push-out tests. For the practical design of new shear connector, it is necessary to develop the equation for the prediction of the load carrying capacity of the shear connector. In this study, the existing design equations for the Perfobond shear connector were briefly analyzed and the equation for the prediction of the shear capacity of T-shaped perforated shear connector was suggested empirically. By comparing the results obtained by the suggested equation, the existing equations for the Perfobond shear connector, and the experiment, the applicability and effectiveness of the suggested equation was estimated...|$|R

The P-T limits in ASME App. G {{are based on}} the fracture toughness of the vessel limiting material accounting for irradiation effects. The fracture toughness of the limiting material is determined based on the plane strain fracture toughness, KIc, indexed to the material reference temperature, RTNDT. Prior to the 2000 Addenda of ASME App. G, fracture toughness was based on the arrest fracture toughness, KIa, but the approval of Code Case N- 640 [1] in 1998 changed the fracture toughness basis to KIc. In addition to the P-T limits determined by ASME App. G, 10 CFR 50 App. G sets additional minimum temperature requirements that limit the operating pressure based on other factors such as the minimum unirradiated reference temperature, RTNDT(u), of the material in the closure <b>head</b> <b>flange</b> region. This paper presents an analysis of the closure <b>head</b> <b>flange</b> region minimum temperature requirements based on both KIa and KIc. Recommendations for potential alternative minimum temperature requirements are made for normal operation and hydrostatic test conditions...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionImpingement is {{a factor}} of failure in total hip {{replacement}} (THR), causing instability and early wear. Its true frequency is not known; cup-retrieval series reported rates varying from 27 to 84 %. HypothesisThe hypothesis was that a large continuous series of THR cup removals would help determine the frequency of component impingement. ObjectivesThe hypothesis was tested on a continuous retrospective series of cups removed in a single center, with a secondary objective of identifying risk factors. Materiel and methodsMacroscopic examination looked for component impingement signs in 416  cups retrieved by a single operator between 1989 and 2004. Risk factors were investigated by uni- and multivariate analyses in the 311  cases for which there were complete demographic data. In these 311  cases, removal was for aseptic loosening (131  cases), infection (43  cases), instability (56  cases), osteolysis (28  cases) or unexplained pain (48  cases); impingement was explicitly implicated in only five cases (1. 6 %), always with hard-on-hard bearing components. ResultsImpingement was found in 214 of the 416  cups (51. 4 %) and was severe (notch> 1 mm) in 130 (31. 3 %). In the subpopulation of 311  cups, impingement was found in 184  cases (59. 2 %) and was severe in 109 (35 %). Neither duration of implant use nor cup diameter or frontal orientation emerged as risk factors. On univariate analysis, impingement was more frequently associated with revision for instability, young patient age at THR, global hip range of motion > 200 ° or use of an extended femoral <b>head</b> <b>flange</b> (or of an elevated antidislocation rim liner), and was more severe in case of head/neck ratio< 2. On multivariate analysis, only use of an extended <b>head</b> <b>flange</b> (RR 3. 2) and revision for instability (RR 4. 2) remained as independent risk factors for impingement. DiscussionComponent impingement is frequently observed in cups after removal, but is rarely found as a direct indication for revision, except in case of hard-on-hard friction couples (polyethylene being the most impingement-tolerant material). Systematic use of extended <b>head</b> <b>flanges</b> and elevated antidislocation rims {{is not to be}} recommended, especially in case of excessive ROM. A good head/neck ratio should be sought, notably by increasing the head diameter in less impingement-tolerant hard-on-hard friction couples. Although not identified as a risk factor in the present study, implant orientation should be checked; computer-assisted surgery can be useful in this regard, for adaptation to the patient's individual range-of-motion cone.

40|$|LectureHigh {{coupling}} guard temperature and oil misting on a power recovery expander {{led to a}} computational fluid dynamics (CFD) investigation of air flow and heat transfer in the {{coupling guard}}. The analyses included full 360 -degree geometry, varying inlet and outlet configurations, different exhaust pressures, and both including and neglecting the <b>flange</b> bolt <b>heads.</b> With bolt heads included, the predicted coupling guard surface temperatures approximately matched values measured in the field. In the particular field problem addressed here, the measured temperatures were 219 to 222 ?F (104 - 106 ?C), while the CFD predicted temperature ranged from 209 - 227 ?F (98 - 108 ?C). Among the important findings are: The moving bolt heads generate much of the heat in a coupling guard; Properly placed outlet ports can use the bolt heads as a blower, increasing air flow through the coupling guard and lowering the temperature; Small reductions in exhaust pressure can lower the coupling guard surface temperature significantly. Numerous plots, graphs, and tables give insight into the flow field inside the coupling guard. These analyses can guide the design of coupling guards with lower surface temperatures...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} an experimental study at elevated temperatures on the behaviour of full-scale composite floor unprotected and protected cellular steel beams with intumescent coating having different size and openings shape. All beams {{were designed for}} a full shear connections between the steel beam and the concrete <b>flange</b> using <b>headed</b> shear studs in order to fail in by web-post buckling. In fire, the temperature distribution across a composite member is non-uniform, since the web and bottom flange have thin cross-sections and a greater exposed perimeter than the top flange. The deterioration of the material properties of the web will therefore become an important effect on the overall performance of the member {{in the event of}} fire. Fire resistance and protection of cellular beams has been very controversial concerning their behaviour in elevated temperatures, the fire protection material and the required thickness. Two failure temperatures were observed in the fire tests indicated that cellular beams failed by web post buckling and Vierendeel bending associated with the buckling of the web posts of the steel section. The finite element modelling software TNO-Diana was used to complete the numerical investigation. Comparison of the experimental and FEM results is presented and both are in good agreement. However the Euro code approach can be improved by using the correct material specification of the intumescent coating used...|$|R

40|$|The {{overpressure}} {{fragility of}} a Mark I {{boiling water reactor}} drywell was performed by detailed finite element (FE) analysis. The drywell overpressure capacity {{is controlled by the}} onset of leakage in the bolted <b>head</b> <b>flange</b> connection once separation exceeds the capacity of the silicone rubber O-ring seals. The FE analysis was conducted at 6 discrete accident temperatures, ranging from 150 to 425 °C. The overpressure evaluation used an axisymmetric model of the drywell head region for computational efficiency, and verified it by comparing to results from one FE model which used 3 D solid elements. The mechanical properties of the steel materials were defined as temperature-dependent linear-elastic. The median overpressure capacity at each temperature was determined using a 2 -step thermal-stress analysis procedure. First, a steady-state heat transfer analysis was conducted to map out the temperature distribution in the drywell wall, which is exposed to the accident temperature on the inside and ambient temperature on the outside. Second, a quasi-static multi-step stress analysis was performed. The vertical differential movement between the flange surfaces was monitored and compared to the O-ring rebound capacity to define the pressure at the onset of leakage. After leakage occurred, the relationship between leakage area and increased pressure was recorded. The evaluation predicted the median overpressure capacity and the lognormal standard deviation for uncertainty in O-ring rebound capacities, bolt preload, and model sophistication, in addition to the median pressure-leak area relationship...|$|R
500|$|The {{body length}} of Z. ferox varies from [...] The head in Z. ferox is broad and {{crescent-shaped}} when viewed dorsally. The frons (upper {{part of the}} insect face) is strongly convex, meaning it curves outwards and the vertexal margin concaves (curves in); it concaves either regularly or strongly. When viewing the full face, the clypeal margin (the border of the clypeus) is broad and concave. The sides are convex and small, yet protruding eyes are present. The posterior corners are round and {{the base of the}} ants' mandibles are concealed by the large expansion of the gena (area below the compound eyes, the insect equivalent to human cheeks). The clypeus is shallow and transverse, and 48 denticles that decrease in length can be seen on the clypeal margin. The denticles are peg-shaped with rounded apices. Dense spine-like setae cover the labrum (a flap-like structure in front of the mouth); these setae are organised into three rows. Each row, on average, contains around 20 setae which increase in length when they are ventral to the clypeus. The mandibles barely overlap medially, with a single large apical tooth and smaller subapical tooth present. The oral surface is covered in spicule-like setae, in which the inner setae are four times longer than the outer setae. The palps are short and the maxillary palps (sensory organs used for tasting and manipulating food) have five segments. The labial palps (counterparts of the maxillary palps used in sensory function for eating) presumably have three segments. The frontal carinae (a pair of cuticular ridges or <b>flanges</b> on the <b>head)</b> are absent in Z. ferox. The antennae are well separated and contain 12 antennomeres, and the scalps are also short; the toruli (socket in which the antenna of an insect articulates) is not significantly raised. The antennal scrobes (grooves {{in the side of the}} head) are shallow and project outwards from the antennal base and towards the ventral margin of the eyes.|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Raylı sistemlerin çıkış noktası oldukça eskiye dayanmaktadır. Çok eski tarihlerde insanların ağır yüklerin taşınmasında bugünkü raylı sistemlere benzer şekilde taşımacılık yaptığı bilinmektedir. Günümüze gelinceye kadar raylı sistemde önemli gelişme sağlanmıştır. Motorlu araçların ortaya çıkışı ile birlikte sanayileşme ve hızlı nüfus artışı raylı sistemlere olan ihtiyacı gün geçtikçe artırmış ve modern demiryolları kurulmuştur. Bugün maglev trenlerle 500 km/h hızın üstüne çıkılmış, ancak maglev trenler henüz yaygınlaşmamıştır. Bilinen en yüksek hızda (max. 430 km/sa) işletme yapan tek maglev tren hattı Çin’de yolcu taşımasında kullanılmaktadır. Klasik demiryolu araçlarının hızı ise bugün 300 km/h’in üstüne çıkmış ve yolcu taşımacılığında önemli bir paya sahip olmuştur. Bütün bu gelişmeler demiryollarının insan hayatındaki yerini ve önemini artırmaktadır. Artan talebin karşılanmasına yönelik birçok çalışma yapılmış ve bunun soncunda çeşitli rijit üstyapı tipleri ortaya çıkmıştır. Bunların neticesinde hem insan hayatının güvenliği hem de uzun süre bozulmadan stabilitesini koruması ve uygun maliyetli olabilmesi açısından demiryolu üstyapı hesaplamaları önem kazanmıştır.   Bu çalışmamızda 2. bölümde balastsız üstyapının avantajları anlatılmış ve dünyada kullanılan rijit üstyapı tipleri tanıtılmış ve üstyapı enkesitleri şekillerle açılanmıştır. 3. bölümde yerinde dökme üstyapıyı oluşturan raylar, bağlantı elemanları, traversler ve betonarme plaklar incelenmiş ve bu elemanlara ait dünyada kullanılan türler sınıflandırılarak anlatılmış ve teknik özellikleri, olumlu ve olumsuz yönleri hakkında bilgiler verilmiştir. 4. bölümde ise LVT üstyapısı ve bileşenleri daha detaylı bir şekilde açıklanarak kullanıdığı hat kısaca tanıtılmış, LVT sistemin seçilmesinde öne çıkan titreşim ve gürültü önlemlerine değinilmiştir. 5. bölümde; üstyapı boyutlandırılmasında kullanılan parametreler ve hesaplamaları anlatılmış,  rijit üstyapı hesaplamasına örnek olarak LVT tipi üstyapının farklı araç işletim durumları için statik analizi yapılmış ve boyutlandırılması gerçekleştirilmiştir.

The {{origin of}} the railway systems is {{considerably}} old. In very old times, {{it is known that}} people were carrying heavy freights by the similar way in concept to railway transportation. From history to present day, there have been significant improvements in the rail system. With the industrial revolution and the appearance of motor vehicles together with the rapid population growth, the need of railway transportation gradually increased and that demands resulted in modern railway establishment. Today, maglev trains have been exceeded 500 km/h speed but this type of railway transportation is not in public use yet. Only one line of maglev train in China known in service carrying passengers with high-speed (maximum velocity is 430 km/h).   On the other hand, conventional rapid trains recently have reached over 300 km/h velocity. These rapid trains nowadays have significant share of transportation in the world. Thanks to all these developments, the railway transportation has been taking more important place in human life. To fulfill the increased demands, many types of railway systems have been implementing and more passengers have been benefiting from railway transportation day by day. Therefore, to provide a secure and comfortable transportation system concurrently with favorable cost, railway track design becomes more prominent. In this study, 2 nd chapter explains conventional railway and the layers of the railway track by giving technical properties. The layers that form the track superstructure are the formation, sub-ballast, ballast, geotextile, frost protection layer. Since the topic of this study is a ballastless track design, sub-ballast and ballast layers are not explained here. Add to this, brief information about sub-base soil condition is given. Besides, according to UIC Code, formation layer thickness has been shown by table depending on the different types of soil quality class.   Types of slab track systems used worldwide and their cross-section properties are also briefly shown together with figures of cross section properties. Some of these balastless tracks have been examined more detailed and their advantages are introduced in general. Lots of different balasstless track systems have been classified in a table and the advantages of ballastless track systems are given in general. In the 3 rd chapter, the components of the cast in-situ slab track system which are rail, fasteners, sleepers and concrete plate or plinth beams are examined and the components of these in worldwide use are classified and introduced. Rail types are described as <b>flange</b> rail, double <b>headed</b> rail and Vignol rail. Technical properties of the rail types briefly given and the specification, features that they should have and information about pros and cons of these elements explained. Rail fasteners systems are described as two types, rigid system fasteners and elastic system fasteners. The features of these types of fasteners are shown together with figures. After that sleepers defined under the titles of wooden, steel, concrete and plastic sleepers. Some types of the sleepers that tried and currently being used in the world explained. In concrete sleeper title, post-stressed and pre-stressed concrete sleepers have been described. In this chapter we also give some information about plinth concrete beam and explain the measures must be taken during its construction stage briefly. In the 4 th chapter, a type of slab track systems LVT has been chosen and explained in more detail. Here we also mentioned about ground born noise and vibration mitigation which has an inspiration to choosing LVT slab track. Some measures that should be taken for special buildings such as hospital and theater are given. Besides this, LVT systems features and advantages are explained. In 5 th chapter, design of railway superstructure with an example of LVT system has been explained. At first, we explain how the wheel loads are transferred from top (rail) to sub-base showing modeling of railway superstructure in figure. Slab track modeling has springs between the layers that form the superstructure. From bottom to top, first springs take place under the rigid concrete slab which represents the soil elasticity. Since we examined LVT system here, second spring is between rigid slab and LVT concrete block so called block pad as explained in chapter 4 and the third spring for modeling takes place under the rail representing rail pad stiffness. This type of modeling can also be seen in figure.   In chapter 5 we also introduce the forces which effect railway superstructure. Forces studied under the titles of vertical forces, horizontal forces, temperature stresses and other forces and technical information about these forces are given. Vertical forces investigated under two titles, static and dynamic vertical forces. As for the horizontal forces, they are shown under two titles either as the forces acting parallel to longitudinally direction of railway superstructure and forces acting perpendicular direction to the railway. In temperature stresses section, the calculation of forces emanating from temperature has been given by equation depending on unit length change and temperature change. Railway roadway design is performed assuming that railway is a beam laid on elastic platform, and therefore, determination of soil type and coefficient of soil stiffness or soil spring value is important. Here in chapter 5, we give information about calculation of coefficient of soil stiffness in light of Winkler and Zimmermann’s equations. For obtain one soil coefficient of stiffness when multi-layer case is subject, Eisenmann’s equivalent layers theory has been used and introduced by the help of a figure and the calculation of this method has been explained. Another coefficient used for superstructure static analyses is dynamic impact factor. Today many types of calculation method developed for taking into consideration of the impact of dynamic forces acting on railway. In this study we used Eisenmann’s equations for the speed until 200 km/h.   5 th chapter also explain the analyses and concrete slab design calculation for LVT system under different vehicle loads. The loads chosen here have been taken from UIC and EN 1991 standards. For freight train maximum speed taken as 100 km/h. As for the passenger train and high-speed train maximum speed taken as 120 km/h and 250 km/h respectively. Load Model 71 from UIC is used for freight train. For passenger and high speed train, type- 2 and type- 3 load model from EN 1991 has been used. It should be kept in mind that there is much more different type of load models depending on vehicle style. For analysis, FEA base computer program SAP 2000 has been preferred. This program allows engineers to model almost every type of structure realistically. To model LVT system in the program, modeling technique of which illustration is given by figure in chapter 5 has been used. Rail pad which take place under the rails at joints and rubber boot and LVT block pad represented by springs. Here LVT concrete block pad and the rubber boot which contains the block thought together and their stiffness combined calculating an equivalent spring coefficient.   Soil condition considered as good and class of the subbase soil taken as QS 3 according to soil classification of UIC Code. In the model soil represented with springs either. Slab area that considered here a bearing beam laid on elastic platform divided into small finite elements for analysis. The analysis results are shown in figures as contours diagram and concrete design has been performed using the longitudinally and transverse moment values. There might be lots of soil types and geometrical properties on the route of railway track. Thus, quite a lot different conditions may be needed to take into account. In this study the chosen part is regarded as an alignment and calculation is performed accordingly. In final section we explained our assessments and thoughts about the results of the study.
