Characterisation results both at DC and at high frequencies prove that the technology is viable, with the circuit exhibiting remarkably high linearity while combining functionality usually achieved in III-V systems with the robustness and flexibility of a MOS platform. This emerging technology qualifies as an ideal candidate for the building of elemental analogue blocks, where tuning and exploitation of device properties will eliminate the need of further linearisation circuitry, which increases noise, complexity and power consumption.

But the output characteristic of CSI depends on not only its performance but also the battery’s nature. This paper presented a practical judge model which can simulate the battery’s output threshold. In a simulation system, the amplitude of <b>inverting</b> <b>current</b> {{can be a very}} large value provided the loop impedance is small enough and the output current can remain steady. But in actual operation CSI has its out put limitation. When the given current is big, the output current will be unsteady.

The reason why the output values differ greatly between simulation and test is discussed. The simulation used a method by adopting a concussion judgment module to detect the CSI’s output state.

For a gas-evolving electrode, the overpotential fluctuates because of bubble evolution but only the global overpotential fluctuations and, more recently, their ohmic part are easily accessible by routine experiments.

40|$|We {{recorded}} photocurrent {{responses of}} retinal rods isolated from cane toads Bufo marinus and clawed frogs Xenopus laevis. With the outer segment drawn part {{way into the}} suction pipette, presentation of flashes {{to the base of}} the mouter segment (outside the pipette) elicited a slow inverted response. Stimulation of the same region, with the outer segment drawn fully in, gave a response of conventional polarity. For moderate to bright flashes a fast transient preceded the slow inverted response. Upon bleaching the tip of the outer segment, the slow inverted response was abolished but the fast initial transient remained, and we attribute this fast component to a capacitive current. Experiments employing simultaneous whole-cell patch-clamp and suction pipette recording revealed that both the fast and slow components of the inverted responses were absent in voltage-clamped cells. In current-clamped cells the slow <b>inverted</b> <b>current</b> response was delayed substantially with respect to the voltage response. We present a computational model for the slow component, in which hyperpolarization leads to increased activity of the Na+–Ca 2 +,K+ exchanger, hence lowering the cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration, activating guanylyl cyclase, raising cyclic GMP concentration, opening cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, and increasing circulating current in the unstimulated region. For the measured voltage response to stimulation of the base, we solve these equations to predict the photocurrent in the tip, and obtain an adequate explanation of the inverted responses.
