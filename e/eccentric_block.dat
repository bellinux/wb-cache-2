A parameterized simulation model of the axial rotation of gears and <b>eccentric</b> <b>block</b> is established, and dynamic change of the impact and the actual movement of the rotating components of the top drive system are analyzed. Then create a virtual prototype {{on the basis of}} that. It can obtain curves that some parameters change relative to time, such as the exciting force and the centroid position of <b>eccentric</b> <b>block.</b> Thus it achieves dynamic simulation analysis of virtual prototype of the top drive system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According to {{the linear}} {{vibration}} {{theory and the}} Lagrange Equation, this paper makes an analysis of dynamics and establishes the dynamics equation of linear vibrating screen machine system and then confirms the relationship among its vibration mass, the supporting spring stiffness, the mass of <b>eccentric</b> <b>block</b> and vibration circular frequency, it provides conditions for the precise design of the linear vibration screening machine’s bearing spring and the accurate calculation of the screening processing capacity,and it provides {{a basis for the}} vibrating screen machine’s force analysis and its strength calculation. By designing the supporting spring of the ZKB 3675 linear vibrating screen machine, it verifies the practicality of the dynamics equation which is established in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Vibration {{cementing}} is a {{new technique}} that can significantly improve the bond strength of cementing interface. To popularize this technique, {{it is necessary to}} solve the key problem of how to make cementing string generate downhole radial vibration in the WOC stage. For this purpose, an electric vibrator was developed. With this vibrator, electric energy is converted into mechanical energy by means of a high-temperature motor vibration unit. The motor vibration unit rotates the <b>eccentric</b> <b>block</b> through an output shaft to generate an exciting source, which produces an axial-rotating exciting force {{at the bottom of the}} casing string. Then, the vibration characteristics of vertical well casing string under the exciting force were analyzed by using the principal coordinate analysis method, and the response model of casing string to an electric vibrator was developed. Finally, the effects of casing string length, exciting force and vibration frequency on the vibration amplitude at the lowermost of the casing string were analyzed based on a certain casing program. It is indicated that the casing string length and the square of vibration frequency are inversely proportional to the vibration amplitude at the lowermost of the casing string, and the exciting force is proportional to the vibration amplitude at the lowermost of the casing string. These research results provide a theoretical support for the application of vibration cementing technology to the cementing sites with different requirements on well depth and amplitude...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of an accentuated eccentric load on subsequent concentric kinetic factors and block jumping performance in elite male volleyball players. Eleven male volleyball high-performance players (18. 9 ± 2. 6 years, 203. 6 ± 5. 6 cm, 91. 4 ± 8. 2 kg), who were training full time with the national team development squad, participated in this within-subject, counter-balanced study. One half of the subjects performed the block jumps (BJ), followed by a 20 kg accentuated <b>eccentric</b> load <b>block</b> jump (AEBJ) condition, whilst the other half of the subject pool performed the testing in the reverse sequence.

One half of the subjects performed the block jumps (BJ), followed by a 20 kg accentuated <b>eccentric</b> load <b>block</b> jump (AEBJ) condition, whilst the other half of the subject pool performed the testing in the reverse sequence. Superior jump heights (4. 3 %) and kinetic and kinematic enhancements (9. 4, 3. 9, 3. 1 % for peak power, peak force, and peak velocity, respectively) were observed in the AEBJ condition compared to the BJ condition, with no order effect observed. The differences between conditions were statistically significant (p < 0. 05), with moderate magnitudes (ES = 0. 1 - 0. 4). The results of this study demonstrate that an accentuated eccentric load evokes acute increases in vertical jump height, as well as in the kinetic and kinematic variables that are considered important to vertical jumping ability (force, velocity, and power) ...|$|R
