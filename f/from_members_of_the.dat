5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, on 3 August in Kraków, Piłsudski formed a small cadre military unit, the First Cadre Company, <b>from</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riflemen's Association and Polish Rifle Squads. That same day, a cavalry unit under Władysław Belina-Prażmowski was sent to reconnoitre across the Russian border, even before the official declaration of war between Austria-Hungary and Russia, which ensued on 6 August.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, it was {{reported}} that several IOC members had taken bribes <b>from</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Salt Lake City bid committee for the hosting of the 2002 Winter Olympics. The IOC pursued an investigation which led to the resignation of four members and expulsion of six others. The scandal set off further reforms that changed the way host cities were selected, to avoid similar cases in the future.|$|E

5|$|Before her marriage, Louise {{served as}} an {{unofficial}} secretary to her mother, the Queen (1866–1871). The question of Louise's marriage was discussed in the late 1860s. Suitors from the royal houses of Prussia and Denmark were suggested, but Victoria wanted new blood {{in the family and}} therefore suggested a high-ranking member of the aristocracy. Despite opposition <b>from</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal family, Louise fell in love with John, Marquess of Lorne, the heir to the Duke of Argyll. Victoria consented to the marriage, which took place on 21 March 1871. Despite a happy beginning, the two drifted apart, possibly because of their childlessness and the Queen's constraints on their activities.|$|E

Webb took depositions about the Milne Bay incident <b>from</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Allied forces who had been present, and used them to form part of his report. In 1944 this was submitted to the United Nations War Crimes Commission, which {{had been set up}} by the Allies following the Moscow Declaration. Evidence about the crimes was presented to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal on 2 January 1947, but no Japanese personnel were prosecuted for actions during the fighting at Milne Bay.|$|E
5|$|Lewisville {{is served}} mainly by media from the Dallas area, {{but a number}} of niche {{publications}} focus on local news. The Lewisville Enterprise merged with The Lewisville Leader in 1962. The paper's publisher and editor at the time, U.O. Clements, was a staunch conservative, but vociferously supported the racial integration of Lewisville Independent School District, for which he received many anonymous threats <b>from</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ku Klux Klan. Clements sold the paper to Harte-Hanks Community Newspapers in 1971. Star Newspapers, which owned the Leader, was purchased by 1013 Communications in 2012. The newspaper is based in Plano, Texas. In 2011, the Lewisville City Council designated the Lewisville portion of Neighborsgo, a weekly section of The Dallas Morning News, as the city's official newspaper of record.|$|E
5|$|Merrick was now {{homeless}} on {{the streets}} of Leicester. His uncle, a barber named Charles Merrick, heard of his nephew's situation, sought him out and offered him accommodation in his home. Merrick continued to hawk around Leicester {{for the next two years}} but his efforts to earn a living met with little more success than before. Eventually, his disfigurement drew such negative attention <b>from</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public that the Commissioners for Hackney Carriages withdrew his licence when it came up for renewal. With young children to provide for, Charles could no longer afford to support his nephew. In late December 1879, now 17 years old, Merrick entered the Leicester Union Workhouse.|$|E

5|$|Several {{features}} of the tooth are only known <b>from</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family Dromaeosauridae of theropod dinosaurs. Dromaeosauroides was classified {{as a member of}} the Dromaeosaurinae subfamily within the Dromaeosauridae, due to its similarity to Dromaeosaurus. Despite the resemblance, Dromaeosauroides is not considered part of that genus. It is unlikely that a genus would survive for 60million years; Dromaeosauroides lived during the Early Cretaceous, and Dromaeosaurus during the Late Cretaceous. The differences between their denticles also indicate they should be kept separate.|$|E
5|$|The Black Hebrews {{believe they}} are descended <b>from</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tribe of Judah who were exiled from the Land of Israel after the Romans {{destroyed}} the Second Temple in 70 CE. The group incorporates elements of African-American culture into their interpretation of the Bible. They do not recognize rabbinical Jewish interpretations such as the Talmud. The Black Hebrews observe Shabbat and biblically ordained Jewish holidays such as Yom Kippur and Passover.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the Palladian country house {{in the seventeenth century}} separated the family of the householder from the servants. Previously sharing the hall, and bedding down at a master's feet, or door, servants were now given separate small chambers. Sometimes these were placed on a mezzanine floor, as at Kinross. Servants were less visible, using backstairs that kept them away <b>from</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family and guests and they fulfilled necessary and sometimes unpleasant tasks. They were also fewer in number, of lower social status and predominately female. A country house could have 10 to 20 servants and large houses had more. A hierarchy of positions developed from the butler and housekeeper to footmen and maids. The sexes were increasingly segregated into their own quarters.|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} {{itself was}} considered {{to have been a}} military failure; not one of its members was ever awarded an Iron Cross while serving in it. Overall, it was better known for committing atrocities than for contributing to the German war effort. Its role in deporting Jews from Kosovo has been questioned by Albanian historian Shaban Sinani, who claims that the division did not participate in any deportations on behalf of the Germans. During the 1998–99 Kosovo War, American journalist Chris Hedges alleged that some Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) leaders were directly descended <b>from</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> division and ideologically influenced by it. Malcolm has challenged this claim.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebellion}} {{resulted in}} the creation of the Province of Manitoba (inclusive of Fort Garry) and a delay in establishing governance in the Territories. In 1870, the Northwest Territories and Manitoba formally entered the Canadian confederation. The two jurisdictions remained partially conjoined: under the Temporary Government Act, 1870. The Temporary North-West Council was appointed in 1872, mainly <b>from</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Manitoba Legislative Assembly, with the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba serving as the leader of the territorial government. The Governor and Council were mandated to govern the Territories through the Manitoba Act and did so from outside of the Northwest Territories. Fort Garry served as the first seat of government for both jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Tucker {{was asked}} for reimbursement, and after negotiation, paid it in part, {{borrowing}} the remainder <b>from</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> academy board. He also acted as custodian of other funds, blended {{them with his}} own and spent it on overindulgence and land speculation. Later he was required to defend himself in these matters before the Virginia General Assembly. Though he was officially cleared of wrongdoing, the incidents tarnished his reputation and highlighted the style of his living in Richmond. Meanwhile, Maria gave birth to their eldest daughter, Eleanor Rosalie, on May 4, 1804.|$|E
