5|$|Although the skulls are incompletely preserved, CT {{scanning}} {{suggests that}} each premaxilla held five incisors, with the sockets becoming progressively larger {{from the first}} to the fifth <b>incisor.</b> Like other theriodonts, the crowns of the incisors are conical; they also lack serrations, unlike gorgonopsians and scylacosaurian therocephalians. The interior edge of the incisors seems to be slightly concave, and the back edge {{appears to have a}} ridge. The smaller specimen has a displaced <b>incisor</b> preserved within its nasal cavity; it is more strongly recurved and has wear marks on its top edge, suggesting that it is probably a lower <b>incisor.</b> Its fourth <b>incisor</b> also has a replacement tooth growing behind it, accompanied by resorption of the root.|$|E
5|$|Lagrivea {{is known}} from three mandibles (lower jaws)—one, the holotype, with the fourth premolar (p4) {{and all three}} molars (m1–3) preserved; one with the <b>incisor</b> and m2; and one with the <b>incisor,</b> p4, m1, and m2—an {{isolated}} lower <b>incisor,</b> and an isolated m2. It was large for a squirrel, and can be distinguished from the fossil squirrels Palaeosciurus, Aliveria, and Ratufa obtusidens by its larger size.|$|E
5|$|The only {{remains of}} Megalomys audreyae {{that have been}} {{described}} in the literature are the original two specimens Gregory found, a left upper <b>incisor</b> and a left mandible (lower jaw). The upper <b>incisor</b> is not grooved and its diameter has a length of 2.6mm and width of 1.5mm, but exhibits no other significant characters.|$|E
5000|$|Children with a {{full set}} of {{deciduous}} teeth (primary teeth) also have eight <b>incisors,</b> named the same way as in permanent teeth. Young children may have from zero to eight <b>incisors</b> depending on the stage of their tooth eruption and tooth development. Typically, the mandibular central <b>incisors</b> erupt first, followed by the maxillary central <b>incisors,</b> the mandibular lateral <b>incisors</b> and finally the maxillary laterals. The rest of the primary dentition erupts after the <b>incisors.</b>|$|R
30|$|No {{significant}} difference in root resorption between the central and lateral <b>incisors</b> was revealed, except for the lower right <b>incisors.</b> There was a tendency, however, for more root resorption for the lateral <b>incisors</b> compared with the central <b>incisors.</b> Recent studies by Nanekrungsan et al. [25] and Lund et al. [3] found lateral <b>incisors</b> to be more often and seriously affected by root resorption.|$|R
50|$|Typical for cetaceans, {{the upper}} <b>incisors</b> are {{aligned with the}} cheek teeth, and, except the small I1, {{separated}} by large diastemata containing pits into which the lower <b>incisors</b> fit. The upper <b>incisors</b> are simple conical teeth with a single root, lacking accessory denticles, and difficult to distinguish from lower <b>incisors.</b> The upper <b>incisors</b> are missing in most specimens and are only known from two specimens. The upper canine is a little larger than the upper <b>incisors,</b> and, like them, directed slightly buccally and mesially.|$|R
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) {{is short}} and deep. The mental foramen, an opening {{at the front of}} the mandible, just before the first molar, opens to the side. The capsular process of the lower <b>incisor,</b> a raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the <b>incisor,</b> is well developed. The two masseteric ridges, to which some of the chewing muscles are attached, are entirely separate, joining only at their front edges, which are located below the first molar.|$|E
5|$|The dentary (lower jaw bone) {{itself is}} robust and short. The length {{axis of the}} p4 makes an angle of about 58° with the length axis of the jawbone. The bone is concave on the lingual, but convex on the labial side. There is a {{diastema}} (gap) between the p4 and the <b>incisor</b> {{that would have been}} in front of it, as in the jaw of Sudamerica. Gurovich estimated the length of the diastema as 2.5mm. There is a rounded mental foramen (an opening in the labial side of the jawbone), with a diameter of 0.7mm, located about 0.8mm below the dorsal margin of the bone and 1.5mm in front of the p4. Although the <b>incisor</b> itself is not preserved, its alveolus (the housing of the root) is in part. As in Sudamerica, it extends far into the dentary, passing below p4. The alveolus is 1.5mm wide below the front root of p4 and 1.4mm {{at the back of the}} jaw fragment. Although the height of the alveolus cannot be determined because the lower side is broken away, the <b>incisor</b> must have been quite deep.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) is less robust than in T.bolivaris. The coronoid process (a {{process in}} the back part of the bone) is small and the capsular process, which houses {{the root of the}} lower <b>incisor,</b> are small. The mental foramen, located in the diastema between the lower <b>incisor</b> and the first molar, opens towards the side, as usual in oryzomyines. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, do not join into a single crest and extend forward to below the first molar.|$|E

5|$|Four {{specimens}} (MACN Pv-RN 702A through 702D) {{are thought}} to represent second upper <b>incisors</b> (I2) of Ferugliotherium. 702A (height 1.5mm; width 1.1mm) and 702B are slightly larger than 702C (height 1.2mm; width 0.9mm) and 702D. The smaller <b>incisors</b> cannot be lateral <b>incisors</b> (I3), because 702C's wear facet is stronger than would be expected in an I3; therefore, all four upper <b>incisors</b> are identified as central <b>incisors</b> (I2). To explain the size difference, Krause and colleagues suggested that Ferugliotherium was variable in size or that the smaller <b>incisors</b> were deciduous precursors of the larger permanent tooth. They considered it less likely that multiple species with similar <b>incisors</b> were present. The upper <b>incisors</b> have enamel only on the dorsal side. The wear facet at the tip is preserved only in 702C, forming an angle of 52° with the dorsal side, and is more concave than the facet in the lower <b>incisors.</b> 702A–D are recognizable as upper <b>incisors</b> {{because they have a}} less acute angle at the tip and are less laterally compressed, more curved, and elliptical in cross section.|$|R
40|$|Delayed {{eruption}} of maxillary permanent central <b>incisors</b> {{in a child}} poses a distressing esthetic quandary to parents, {{by virtue of its}} location in the dental architecture. Well-aligned anterior teeth add confidence to smile and have enhanced self-esteem, which is critical even in early life. Impaction of the maxillary central <b>incisors</b> compared to third molars or the canines is less reported; bilateral supplemental maxillary central <b>incisors</b> related to impacted permanent maxillary central <b>incisors</b> are rare and one of the supplemental central <b>incisors</b> showing unusual talon is still infrequent. A case of impacted maxillary permanent central <b>incisors</b> related to supplemental maxillary central <b>incisors,</b> with one of them showing an unusual talon cusp, is presented...|$|R
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) looks chunky {{and has a}} long condyloid {{process at}} its back; that of T.talamancae is more slender. The capsular process, a projection {{at the back of}} the jaw which houses the root of the lower <b>incisor,</b> is poorly developed.|$|E
5|$|The mandible, {{which is}} {{severely}} damaged and lacks the condyloid, coronoid, and angular processes {{at the back}} of the bone, contains the second and third molar and part of the lower <b>incisor,</b> but the first molar is missing. The capsular process of the lower <b>incisor,</b> a slight raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the <b>incisor,</b> is small. The preserved alveoli, the impressions left by the roots, show that the first molar was supported by large roots at the front and back and a smaller root in between these. The second molar is about square and shows the four main cusps commonly present in rodents: the protoconid, metaconid, hypoconid, and entoconid. A strongly developed mesolophid (a crest) is also present, as in most oryzomyines. The main valley between the cusps, the hypoflexid, is broad and V-shaped. The third molar is as long as the second, but it is narrower and the entoconid is poorly developed. Again, the hypoflexid is broad and V-shaped. The length of the toothrow at the alveoli is 8.7mm. The length of the second molar is 2.5mm and the width is 2.2mm. The third molar has a length of 2.5mm and width of 1.8mm.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} {{to those of}} Tachyoryctes audax, the nasal bones are larger and have angles at the sides. T.annectens, which is nearly as large, has smaller teeth and nasals; in T.rex, the basioccipital is broader, and the back part of the mandible (lower jaw) is better developed and has the capsule of the <b>incisor</b> placed further to the front.|$|E
50|$|Shovel-shaped <b>incisors</b> (or, more simply, shovel <b>incisors)</b> are <b>incisors</b> whose lingual {{surfaces}} are scooped {{as a consequence}} of lingual marginal ridges, crown curvature or basal tubercles, either alone or in combination.|$|R

50|$|More teeth appear, {{often in}} the order of two lower <b>incisors</b> then two upper <b>incisors</b> {{followed}} by four more <b>incisors</b> and two lower molars but some babies may still be waiting for their first.|$|R
5|$|Microdontia of {{a single}} tooth {{is more likely to}} occur in a maxillary lateral <b>incisor.</b> The second most likely tooth to have microdontia are third molars. Macrodontia of all the teeth is known to occur in {{pituitary}} gigantism and pineal hyperplasia. It may also occur {{on one side of the}} face in cases of hemifacial hyperplasia.|$|E
5|$|Pennatomys nivalis was a {{medium-sized}} species without many distinctive adaptations. The nasal bones were short and blunt-ended. The zygomatic plate, a bony plate {{at the side}} of the skull, was broad. The bony palate was long and flat. The root of the lower <b>incisor</b> was housed in a bony protuberance, the capsular process. The molars were low-crowned and possess accessory crests such as mesolophs. The upper molars all had three roots.|$|E
5|$|The {{king was}} already {{advanced}} in {{age at the}} time of his death, being over fifty years old, to judge by the <b>incisor</b> teeth, which are worn and corroded by the impurities of which the Egyptian bread was full. The body, though small and emaciated, shows evidence of unusual muscular strength; the head is bald, the features are refined, and the mouth still bears an expression characteristic of shrewdness and cunning.|$|E
5|$|The toothcomb of most lemuriforms {{includes}} six finely spaced teeth, four <b>incisors</b> and two canine {{teeth that}} are procumbent (tilt forward) {{in the front}} of the mouth. The procumbent lower canine teeth are the same shape as the <b>incisors</b> located between them, but they are more robust and curve upward and inward, more so than the <b>incisors.</b> In the permanent dentition, the canines erupt after the <b>incisors.</b> The crowns of the <b>incisors</b> are also angled in the direction of the forward tilt, and the crowns of both the <b>incisors</b> and canines are elongated and compressed side-to-side. The apical ridge, following along the front edges of the toothcomb teeth, is V-shaped in most lemuriforms, tapering off from the midline. As a result of this dental reconfiguration, the upper and lower <b>incisors</b> do not contact one another, and often the upper <b>incisors</b> are reduced or lost completely.|$|R
5000|$|Overjet is {{the extent}} of {{horizontal}} (anterior-posterior) overlap of the maxillary central <b>incisors</b> over the mandibular central <b>incisors.</b> In class II (division I) malocclusion the overjet is increased as the maxillary central <b>incisors</b> are protruded.|$|R
30|$|The maxillary <b>incisors</b> had {{significantly}} greater retrusion and extrusion {{in the experimental}} groups (Table  7). Previous studies [10]-[12],[17] also observed retrusion of the maxillary <b>incisors</b> in patients treated with the Jasper Jumper, while other researches [10],[12],[17] indicated extrusion of the maxillary <b>incisors</b> using Jasper Jumper. Probably, palatal tipping was minimized in the Jasper Jumper group by the incorporation of labial crown torque in the maxillary <b>incisors.</b> Other studies also observed all these dentoalveolar effects on maxillary <b>incisors</b> during Bionator treatment [20],[21],[23].|$|R
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) is robust. The two masseteric ridges, which anchor {{some of the}} chewing muscles, {{are joined}} together as a single crest {{for a portion of}} their length and extend forward to a point below the first molar. The capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the lower <b>incisor,</b> is well developed.|$|E
5|$|The premaxillary bones {{each house}} a single <b>incisor,</b> {{which is located}} at the front tip. They end in a V shape at the front margin and in a narrow point at the back margin. Inside each premaxilla is a large opening, the {{anterior}} palatal foramen. The maxillary bone contains the other upper teeth. The mandible ranges from thin to robust and houses the lower teeth.|$|E
5|$|The root of {{the lower}} <b>incisor</b> is visible {{at the back of}} the {{mandible}} (lower jaw) as a slight protrusion; a true capsular process is absent. There are 13 thoracic (chest), 7 lumbar, 4 sacral, and 38 or 39 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The humerus (upper arm bone) lacks an entepicondylar foramen.|$|E
40|$|Background/PurposeTraumatic injury {{often results}} in pulp {{necrosis}} of immature permanent <b>incisors</b> in children. This study compared clinical outcomes for 40 necrotic immature permanent <b>incisors</b> treated with calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH) 2] or mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) apexification/apexogenesis. MethodsForty necrotic open-apex <b>incisors</b> from 40 children aged 6. 5 – 10 years were divided evenly into four groups with each group containing teeth of similar type and similar root apex width in patients of similar age. Group 1 <b>incisors</b> were treated with ultrasonic filing and MTA placement; Group 2 were treated with ultrasonic filing and Ca(OH) 2 medication; Group 3 were treated with hand filing and MTA placement; and Group 4 were treated with hand filing and Ca(OH) 2 medication. ResultsGroup 1 <b>incisors</b> needed the shortest mean duration (5. 4  ±  1. 1 weeks) for apical hard tissue barrier formation, followed by Group 3 <b>incisors</b> (7. 8  ±  1. 8 weeks), Group 2 <b>incisors</b> (11. 3  ±  1. 3 weeks), and Group 4 <b>incisors</b> (13. 1  ±  1. 5 weeks). Group 1 <b>incisors</b> had a significantly shorter mean elongated root length (2. 1  ±  0. 2  mm) after treatment than Group 2 <b>incisors</b> (3. 5  ±  0. 3  mm, p <  0. 001), and Group 3 <b>incisors</b> had a significantly shorter mean elongated root length (2. 1  ±  0. 1  mm) after treatment than Group 4 <b>incisors</b> (3. 7  ±  0. 3  mm, p <  0. 001). ConclusionNecrotic open-apex <b>incisors</b> treated with ultrasonic filing plus MTA placement need the shortest mean duration for apical hard tissue barrier formation. For elongation of apical root length, Ca(OH) 2 apexification/apexogenesis is better than MTA apexification/apexogenesis, regardless if either ultrasonic or hand filing are used...|$|R
500|$|The <b>incisors,</b> {{known only}} from Ferugliotherium, are procumbent and long. Three lower and four upper <b>incisors</b> are known.

5|$|The {{specimen}} MACN Pv-RN 975, {{first described}} by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996, {{may be a}} jaw fragment of Ferugliotherium, although {{it has also been}} identified as an unrelated multituberculate. The fossil preserves a bladelike premolar, identified as the fourth premolar, and the piece of the jawbone below it. A diastema (gap) is present between the premolar and the <b>incisor</b> that would have been located in front of it. The alveolus (socket) of the lower <b>incisor</b> extends {{all the way through the}} fossil. The p4 bears eight ridges on both sides of the longitudinal crest and is supported by two roots at the front and back. The p4 assigned to Argentodites also has eight ridges on both sides, which descend from cusps on the upper margin, and roots at the front and back. According to Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues, it differs from that of MACN Pv-RN 975 in its rounded, as opposed to angular shape. However, Gurovich and Beck attribute this difference to the fact that the latter has undergone much more wear.|$|E
5|$|A single {{mandible}} from Porto Spanjo (one of {{the sites}} where fossils of A.donovani have been found), without preserved molars, differs from all Agathaeromys dentaries and is thought to represent an unknown different sigmodontine rodent. This jaw is more slender than A.donovani dentaries, has a shorter diastema (gap) between the incisors and molars, has the <b>incisor</b> less shifted lingually relative to the molars, and has more roots under the molars, {{as shown by the}} preserved alveoli.|$|E
5|$|As {{noted by}} Arthur M. Greenhall:If there is fur {{on the skin}} of the host, the common vampire bat uses its canine and cheek teeth like a barber's blades to shave away the hairs. The bat's razor-sharp upper <b>incisor</b> teeth then make a 7mm wide and 8mm deep cut. The upper incisors lack enamel, which keeps them {{permanently}} razor sharp. Their teeth are so sharp, even handling their skulls in a museum can result in cuts.|$|E
30|$|Increasing the labial {{inclination}} can mostly {{harm the}} central <b>incisors,</b> {{followed by the}} lateral <b>incisors.</b> This finding warns against long durations of splinting in patients with increased inclination of the mandibular <b>incisors</b> (i.e., increased IMPA) and/or patients with reduced labial bone thickness.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- On routine medical checkups of 1 st MBBS {{students}} during the admission into medical college, 2 boy students {{were found to}} have persistent primary mandibular central <b>incisors</b> and 1 girl student was found to have only 2 maxillary <b>incisors</b> instead of 4 in the upper jaw where the lateral maxillary <b>incisors</b> were missing. In the first two cases, on inspection of dentition of both boys, the primary milk teeth were present in the mandible only. These were small when compared to other secondary dentition. Gums were normal. There was no eruption of permanent mandibular central <b>incisors.</b> The primary teeth were as strong as the other permanent teeth. There was no considerable difficulty in speech or mastication. There was neither history of allergy nor any family history. In the third case, the girl student was unaware of her missing teeth and on inspection of her teeth; the lateral <b>incisors</b> of upper jaw were missing. There were only two central <b>incisors</b> on the maxillary arch with their respective sockets. There was no gap between the <b>incisors</b> and the canines denoting the absence of their sockets as well. Mandibular <b>incisors</b> were 4 with their sockets and all the other teeth were mere normal. No gum abnormality was seen. There was neither significant history of allergy nor any family history.
