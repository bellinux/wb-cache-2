Real property may be used in other federally sponsored projects or programs that have purposes similar to the one the property was bought for, as long as the federal government authorizes it. However it may not dispose of or <b>encumber</b> the title to {{real property}} without prior federal government consent. When it is no longer needed for the federally supported programs or projects, the recipient must request disposition instructions from the federal government. As with equipment, if the property is sold, a proportionate share is provided to the federal government, amount of the current fair market value, based on the percent of federal funds to own recipient's fund used to acquire the item.|$|E

500|$|As {{had also}} {{been the case with}} his predecessors, the rank of {{adjutant}} was seen by Joaquim Inácio as an embarrassment. Inside the armada administration, it denoted the most important office, as it was filled by an officer who acted as the navy minister's direct representative in the armada. Even so, the title of [...] "adjutant" [...] was itself perceived as demeaning. Joaquim Inácio later complained: [...] "In what part of the world... does the navy minister have a general officer as an adjutant? What is an adjutant, other than a young officer who transmits orders, and even messages, he receives from his chief?" [...] He concluded: [...] "Thus the title of adjutant cannot <b>encumber</b> an officer who supervises the armada's discipline and answers for it." [...] His request to have the designation for the position changed to a more appropriate title was ignored. He also felt slighted that many of his proposals to the navy boards regarding improvements were not acted on, and on 21 November 1860, he asked to be removed from all positions.|$|E

[...] The Nelson Examiner reported: [...] "There were no prisoners made in these late engagements as General Chute ... does not care to <b>encumber</b> himself with such costly luxuries," [...] while politician Alfred Saunders agreed there were [...] "avoidable cruelties".

2500|$|An {{individual}} person, for Kierkegaard, is {{a particular}} that no abstract formula or definition can ever capture. Including the individual in [...] "the public" [...] (or [...] "the crowd" [...] or [...] "the herd") or subsuming a human being as simply {{a member of a}} species is a reduction of the true meaning of life for individuals. What philosophy or politics try to do is to categorize and pigeonhole individuals by group characteristics, each with their own individual differences. In Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 Kierkegaard says the differences aren't important, the likeness with God is what brings equality. In the hallowed places, in every upbuilding view of life, the thought arises in a person’s soul that help him to fight the good fight with flesh and blood, with principalities and powers, and in the fight to free himself for equality before God, whether this battle is more a war of aggression against the differences that want to <b>encumber</b> him with worldly favoritism or a defensive war against the differences that want to make him anxious in worldly perdition. Only in this way is equality the divine law, only in this way is the struggle the truth, only in this way does the victory have validity- only when the single individual fights for himself with himself within himself and does not unseasonably presume to help the whole world to obtain external equality, which is of very little benefit, all the less so because it never existed, {{if for no other reason}} than that everyone would come to thank him and become unequal before him, only in this way is equality the divine law.

40|$|Mobile {{handheld}} {{devices such}} as smartphones are now convenient as they allow users to make calls, reply to emails, find nearby services and many more. The increase in functionality and availability of mobile applications also allow mobile devices {{to be used in}} many different everyday situations (for example, while on the move and carrying items). While previous work has investigated the interaction difficulties in walking situations, {{there is a lack of}} empirical work in the literature on mobile input when users are physically constrained by other activities. As a result, how users input on touchscreen handheld devices in <b>encumbered</b> and mobile contexts is less well known and deserves more attention to examine the usability issues that are often ignored. This thesis investigates targeting performance on touchscreen mobile phones in one common <b>encumbered</b> situation - when users are carrying everyday objects while on the move. To identify the typical objects held during mobile interactions and define a set of common encumbrance scenarios to evaluate in subsequent user studies, Chapter 3 describes an observational study that examined users in different public locations. The results showed that people carried different types of bags and boxes the most frequently. To measure how much tapping performance on touchscreen mobile phones is affected, Chapter 4 examines a range of encumbrance scenarios, which includes holding a bag in-hand or a box underarm, either on the dominant or non-dominant side, during target selections on a mobile phone. Users are likely to switch to a more effective input posture when <b>encumbered</b> and on the move, so Chapter 5 investigates one- and two- handed <b>encumbered</b> interactions and evaluates situations where both hands are occupied with multiple objects. Touchscreen devices afford various multi-touch input types, so Chapter 6 compares the performance of four main one- and two- finger gesture inputs: tapping, dragging, spreading &# 38; pinching and rotating, while walking and <b>encumbered.</b> Several main evaluation approaches have been used in previous walking studies, but more attention is required when the effects of encumbrance is also being examined. Chapter 7 examines the appropriateness of two methods (ground and treadmill walking) for <b>encumbered</b> and walking studies, justifies the need to control walking speed and examines the effects of varying walking speed (i. e. walking slower or faster than normal) on <b>encumbered</b> targeting performance. The studies all showed a reduction in targeting performance when users were walking and <b>encumbered,</b> so Chapter 8 explores two ways to improve target selections. The first approach defines a target size, based on the results collected from earlier studies, to increase tapping accuracy and subsequently, a novel interface arrangement was designed which optimises screen space more effectively. The second approach evaluates a benchmark pointing technique, which has shown to improve the selection of small targets, to see if it is useful in walking and <b>encumbered</b> contexts...|$|R
