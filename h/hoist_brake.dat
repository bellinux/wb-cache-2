40|$|In {{its most}} recent report on the annual {{probability}} of failure of the waste <b>hoist</b> <b>brake</b> system at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), the annual failure rate is calculated to be 1. 3 E({minus} 7) (1 /yr), rounded off from 1. 32 E({minus} 7). A calculation by the Environmental Evaluation Group (EEG) produces a result that is about 4 % higher, namely 1. 37 E({minus} 7) (1 /yr). The difference {{is due to a}} minor error in the US Department of Energy (DOE) calculations in the Westinghouse 1996 report. WIPP`s hoist safety relies on a braking system consisting of a number of components including two crucial valves. The failure rate of the system needs to be recalculated periodically to accommodate new information on component failure, changes in maintenance and inspection schedules, occasional incidents such as a hoist traveling out-of-control, either up or down, and changes {{in the design of the}} brake system. This report examines DOE`s last two reports on the redesigned waste hoist system. In its calculations, the DOE has accepted one EEG recommendation and is using more current information about the component failures rates, the Nonelectronic Parts Reliability Data (NPRD). However, the DOE calculations fail to include the data uncertainties which are described in detail in the NPRD reports. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission recommended that a system evaluation include mean estimates of component failure rates and take into account the potential uncertainties that exist so that an estimate can be made on the confidence level to be ascribed to the quantitative results. EEG has made this suggestion previously and the DOE has indicated why it does not accept the NRC recommendation. Hence, this EEG report illustrates the importance of including data uncertainty using a simple statistical example...|$|E

40|$|Through {{continuing}} {{studies on}} high-temperature space materials useful for better brake linings, Bendix Corporation worked with Ames Research Center {{to develop a}} novel composite. This team worked to fabricate several combinations of composite materials and evaluated results. The one selected increases wear rates and lowers costs. It exhibits constant coefficient of friction at temperatures as high as 650 degrees Fahrenheit, a region where conventional brake linings fade markedly. Other suitable markets include brakes for trucks and industrial equipment such as overhead cranes and <b>hoists.</b> Afterwards <b>brake</b> linings could find successful application in passenger cars...|$|R
40|$|During Core Alterations with a fuel {{assembly}} raised {{out of the}} core, a loss of power occurs to the Refuel Mast. Area radiation levels are slightly elevated and preparations are being made to lower the {{fuel assembly}}. However, it is discovered that the one-rod out interlock is not functioning for the Reactor Mode Switch. What must be done {{in order to continue}} Core Alterations and lower the fuel assembly? A. Verify the Reactor Mode Switch is LOCKED in the REFUEL position, then release the Refuel Mast Main <b>Hoist</b> Motor Electric <b>Brake,</b> and lower the mast by turning the electric motor shaft with a wrench. B. Verify the Reactor Mode Switch is LOCKED in the SHUTDOWN position, then release the Refuel Mast Air Brake, while intermittently releasing the Main <b>Hoist</b> Motor Electric <b>Brake.</b> C. Verify the Reactor Mode Switch is LOCKED in the REFUEL position, then intermittently place the Refuel Mast control in lower while releasing the Refuel Mast Brakes. D.

40|$|Abstract. The {{electro-hydraulic}} proportional {{relief valve}} {{which will be}} used widely, has better stability and pollution resistance compared with the traditional nozzle flapper and the electro-hydraulic proportional reversing valve in the <b>hoist</b> constant deceleration <b>braking</b> system. The model of the G-Ï€ bridge electro-hydraulic proportional relief valve is built in this paper based on the simulation software-AMESim and the characteristic curves of the port pressure are plotted according to different step signals. The influence that the oil elastic modulus exerts to the dynamic characteristics of the valve is also studied in this paper, which provides data supports for the rational design of the valve structure and the hydraulic oil with certain elastic modulus. As the core component of the hoist constant deceleration, the electro-hydraulic proportional relief valve provides the theory basis for the next research of the constant deceleration...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to derive an analytical model representing a reduced form of a mine <b>hoist</b> hydraulic <b>braking</b> system. Based primarily on fluid mechanical and mechanical physical modeling, along {{with a number of}} simplifying assumptions, the analytical model will be derived and expressed {{in the form of a}} system of differential equations including a set of static functions. The obtained model will be suitable for basic simulation and analysis of system dynamics, with the aim to capture the fundamentals regarding feedback control of the brake system pressure. The thesis will mainly cover hydraulic servo valve and brake caliper modeling including static modeling of brake lining stress-strain and disc spring deflectionforce characteristics. Nonlinearities such as servo valve hysteresis, saturation, effects of under- or overlapping spool geometry, flow forces, velocity limitations and brake caliper frictional forces have intentionally been excluded in order not to make the model overly complex. The hydraulic braking system will be described in detail and basic theory that is needed regarding fluid properties and fluid mechanics will also be covered so as to facilitate the reader in his understanding of the material presented in this work. Overall, the scope of this thesis is broad and more work remains in order to complement the model of the system both qualitatively and quantitatively. Although not complete in its simplified form and with known nonlinearities aside, the validity of the model in the lower frequency domain is confirmed by results given in form of measurements and dynamic simulation. Static analysis of the brake caliper model is also verified to be essentially correct when comparing calculated characteristics against actual measurements, as is also the case for the static models of the brake lining and disc-spring characteristics...|$|R
5000|$|Beside {{the open}} ground floor within the arches {{there are two}} more floors to the mill, the first, lower, or stone floor 15 ft above ground level, housing millstones, great spur wheel, hurst frame, sack hoist rope passing through the floor trap, and the upper, second, or <b>hoist</b> floor with <b>brake</b> wheel, main gearing (wallover), sack hoist pulley, {{and parts of the}} winding winch. The windshaft and the main parts of the winding system {{including}} the wind direction indicator is installed within the cap. The space inside the arches, until 1930, used to have a wooden structure to store the grain, and an open timber staircase to reach the milling floors. This structure was removed to prevent vandalism. The cap of the mill is a shallow dome which used to be covered with lead sheet, but also because of vandalism is now covered with aluminium. Between the cap and the top of the wall is a system of rollers running in a track plate allowing the cap to be rotated easily. There is a wind direction indicator on the roof which is continued into the interior, and a small repeat indicator at its lower end, so that the miller could set the mill without leaving his work. The lattice-type-sails are 60 ft span counter clock-wise rotation (seen from outside the mill; most of all windmills worldwide rotate clockwise seen from inside the mill - from [...] "under the wind") and with 450 sq ft of canvas. The arched tower covers a very small diameter of 22 ft and it has an unusual [...] "in cap" [...] winding gear for an English windmill, the cap being winded by a hand operated winch having spur and worm gears.|$|R
