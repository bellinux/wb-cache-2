40|$|Abstract The {{integration}} of cellular and VoIP over WLAN (VoWLAN) systems recently has attracted considerable in-terest from both academia and industry. A cellular/VoWLAN <b>dual-mode</b> <b>system</b> enables users to access a low-cost VoIP service in a WLAN hotspot and {{switch to a}} wide-area cellular system without WLANs. Unfortunately, cellular/VoWLAN dual-mode mobiles suffer the power consumption problem that becomes {{one of the major}} concerns for commercial de-ployment of the dual-mode service. In this study, we present a novel power saving mechanism, called PIANO (paging via another radio), for the {{integration of}} heterogeneous wireless networks, and further apply the proposed methods to imple-ment a cellular/VoWLAN <b>dual-mode</b> <b>system.</b> Based on the proposed mechanisms, a dual-mode mobile can completely switch off its WLAN interface, only leaving the cellular interface awake to listen to paging messages. When a mo-bile receives a paging message from its cellular interface, it wakes up the WLAN interface and responds to connec-tion requests via WLAN networks. Therefore, a dual-mode mobile reduces the power consumption by turning off the WLAN interface during idle, and can also receive VoWLAN services. Measurement results based on the prototype system demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly extend the standby hours of a dual-mode mobile...|$|E

40|$|MEMS {{resonators}} {{have the}} capability to match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art quartz timing references {{at a fraction of the}} size, power, and cost. To enable this capability, this work investigates the use of fused silica as a substrate for piezoelectrically actuated resonators for applications in timing references. This thesis presents the design and fabrication of a piezoelectrically actuated fused silica resonator. The fabricated resonators show a quality factor (Q) of 19, 671 at 4. 96 MHz with an insertion loss of 16. 9 dB, and is the first reported example of a piezoelectrically actuated fused silica resonator in literature. An in-depth investigation into loss mechanisms in fused silica is performed in order to identify and address the major losses in the device and maximize potential performance. Multiple experimental and analytical investigations are presented, with a new form of loss, known as charge redistribution, presented as a possible dominant loss in these piezoelectric resonators. This loss mechanism is analytically modeled and simulated to have a Q of 25, 100, within 20 % of the experimentally measured devices. The temperature sensitivity of fused silica is also addressed; as fused silica shows a temperature coefficient of elasticity almost three times higher than that shown in uncompensated silicon. Both active and passive methods of temperature compensation are implemented, including a fused silica ovenized platform and nickel-refilled trenches for temperature compensation. The nickel-refilled trenches are shown to reduce temperature sensitivity in piezoelectrically actuated fused silica resonators from 78 ppm/K to 50 ppm/K, with larger compensation possible but complete compensation infeasible from passive techniques alone. From this, a <b>dual-mode</b> <b>system</b> is proposed for use in ovenized systems where two modes are simultaneously activated in a single device volume. In this system, one mode acts as a stable reference frequency and the second mode acts as a temperature sensor, allowing for extremely accurate ovenization.

40|$|An {{unsupervised}} machine-learning technique, {{aimed at}} {{the identification of the}} optimal rule-based control strategy, has been developed for parallel hybrid electric vehicles that feature a torque-coupling (TC) device, a speed-coupling (SC) device or a <b>dual-mode</b> <b>system,</b> which is able to realize both actions. The approach is based on the preliminary identification of the optimal control strategy, which is carried out by means of a benchmark optimizer, based on the deterministic dynamic programming technique, for different driving scenarios. The optimization is carried out by selecting the optimal values of the control variables (i. e., transmission gear and power flow) in order to minimize fuel consumption, while taking into account several constraints in terms of NOx emissions, battery state of charge and battery life consumption. The results of the benchmark optimizer are then processed with the aim of extracting a set of optimal rule-based control strategies, which can be implemented onboard in real-time. The input variables of the rule-based strategy are the vehicle power demand, the vehicle speed and the state of charge of the battery. The method for the rule extraction can be summarized as follows. A clustering algorithm discretizes the input domain (in terms of vehicle power demand, vehicle speed and state of charge of the battery) into a mesh of clusters. The generic rule associated to a specific cluster (i. e., the combination of gear and power flow that has to be actuated) is identified by searching for the control strategy most frequently adopted by the benchmark optimizer within the considered cluster. The optimal mesh of clusters is generated using a genetic algorithm technique. Optimal sets of rules are identified for different driving scenarios. These strategies can then be implemented on-board, provided the mission features are known {{at the beginning of the}} trip. The main advantage of the proposed technique is that the definition of the rule-based strategy is derived from a machine learning method and is not based on heuristic techniques...|$|E

40|$|<b>Dual-mode</b> {{cellular}} <b>systems</b> {{based on}} the EIA/TIA IS- 54 standard offer the eventual prospect of carrying up to six digital calls in the same bandwidth as a single analog call [1]. During the transition from analog to digital service, however, the call-carrying capacity of such systems will be limited {{by the presence of}} existing analog users. In this situation, it is reasonable to ask if there are call-handling strategies that could increase the total traffic carried by providing preferential treatment to digital users. We consider four such strategies for maximizing the total traffic carried by a <b>dual-mode</b> cellular <b>system.</b> For two of these strategies, including the baseline "no-control" strategy, we develop closed-form solutions for carried traffic and other related service statistics. The closed-form solution for the no-control case is then extended to provide a tight upper bound on carried traffic for any control strategy. We also present a method for finding the optimal control strategy by applying linear programming (LP) techniques. The strategies are compared for various proportions of analog and digital users and offered traffic levels. The findings show that it is actually quite difficult to obtain gains using strategies that exploit the difference in spectral efficiency between analog and digital calls, even with formally optimal strategies. While this is an unexpected finding, we feel the conclusion has been well validated and is now understood and explained in the paper.

However, when paired with hydroxlammonium nitrate, the specific impulse is comparable. Density Impulse for ionic liquids is found to be superior due to their higher density. Analytical investigation of an electrospray electric propulsion system shows that some ionic liquids are capable of operating in a purely ionic regime, providing very high specific impulse (~ 6000 sec).
