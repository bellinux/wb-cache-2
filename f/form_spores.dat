25|$|The sori are pale brown, {{resembling}} {{those of}} the parent species. The chromosome number of the sporophyte is 2n = 108; it is a triploid. As a hybrid triploid, A.×trudellii is unable to undergo meiosis to <b>form</b> <b>spores,</b> and its spores are typically abortive and sterile. Such {{was the case in}} examinations of Georgia, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania material by Wherry and Paul Kestner in 1932. Both found only sterile spores. However, the species has been observed, particularly along the lower Susquehanna River, to form colonies, suggesting that it undergoes independent reproduction. This has been hypothesized to occur by apogamy, yielding triploid spores and gametophytes which then grow directly into a new generation of triploid sporophytes.|$|E
500|$|Pulveroboletus bembae is {{a species}} of fungus in the Boletaceae family that was first {{described}} in 2009. It is known only from the rainforest of northern Gabon, a region known for its high level of species diversity. Like all boletes, P.bembae has fleshy fruit bodies that <b>form</b> <b>spores</b> in tubes perpendicular to the ground {{on the underside of}} the cap. These yellowish tubes form a surface of pores, each about 1–2mm in diameter. The brownish caps may reach up to [...] wide, and rest atop pale brown stems up to [...] long. The stems have a woolly, whitish yellow ring of tissue that is short-lived, and may be absent in older specimens. The spores of P.bembae are spindle- or fuse-shaped, and have rough surfaces—a detail observable when viewed with scanning electron microscopy. The fungus grows in a mycorrhizal relationship with Gilbertiodendron dewevrei, the dominant tree species of the Guineo-Congolian rainforest. Other similar Pulveroboletus species in the area include P.annulus and P.croceus, which may be differentiated from P.bembae by a combination of macro- and microscopic characteristics.|$|E
40|$|Twenty-five {{strains of}} Clostridium sordellii {{were divided into}} two groups on the basis of spore fine structure. Sixteen strains <b>formed</b> <b>spores</b> with smooth tubular appendages, and nine strains <b>formed</b> <b>spores</b> which lacked appendages.

Since the minor strain variability which was encountered did not correlate with spore appendage status, fragmentation of this species on the basis of spore appendage status is not advocated...|$|R
25|$|Sporulation {{medium is}} medium used when spores {{have to be}} formed. It {{can also be used}} when working with fungi or {{bacteria}} depending on whether or not the strain is capable of <b>forming</b> <b>spores.</b>|$|R
50|$|A more {{effective}} method is Tyndallization, which uses three successive steam treatments to achieve sterilization {{over the course}} of three days. This works by killing vegetative cells, allowing germination of surviving spores, and killing the resulting vegetative cells before they have time to <b>form</b> further <b>spores.</b> Any surviving spores from the first treatment, or incidentally <b>formed</b> <b>spores</b> during the first incubation period, are killed in a third steaming cycle.|$|R
2500|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae, or pneumococcus, is a Gram-positive, alpha-hemolytic (under aerobic conditions) or beta-hemolytic (under {{anaerobic}} conditions), {{facultative anaerobic}} {{member of the}} genus Streptococcus.

2500|$|S. aureus ( [...] , Greek σταφυλόκοκκος, [...] "grape-cluster berry", Latin aureus, [...] "golden") is a facultative anaerobic, gram-positive coccal (round) {{bacterium}} {{also known}} as [...] "golden staph" [...] and [...] "oro staphira". S. aureus is non-motile and does not <b>form</b> <b>spores.</b> In medical literature, the bacterium {{is often referred to}} as S. aureus, Staph aureus or Staph A.. S. aureus [...] appears as staphylococci (grape-like clusters) when viewed through a microscope, and has large, round, golden-yellow colonies, often with hemolysis, when grown on blood agar plates. S. aureus reproduces asexually by binary fission. [...] Complete separation of the daughter cells is mediated by S. aureus autolysin, and in its absence or targeted inhibition, the daughter cells remain attached to one another and appear as clusters.|$|E

50|$|Anaerobic gram-positive bacilli {{affecting}} {{human beings}} are generally divided into two distinct groups, those that <b>form</b> <b>spores</b> (Clostridium spp) {{and those that do}} not <b>form</b> <b>spores.</b> Within the spore-forming group of Clostridium species, some are very pathogenic or toxigenic (C. perfringens) while others are rarely pathogenic.
