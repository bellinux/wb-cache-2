5|$|In {{the fourteenth}} season, Bart {{convinced}} Krusty {{to run for}} Congress so that Krusty could introduce an airline rerouting bill and stop planes from flying over the Simpsons' house. Krusty agreed and ran on the Republican ticket. Although his campaign started off badly, Lisa suggested that <b>he</b> <b>try</b> connecting with regular families, which Krusty did, resulting in a landslide victory. Krusty's term started off badly, as he was completely ignored by his new, more politically savvy colleagues. With {{the help of the}} Simpsons and an influential doorman, however, Krusty succeeded in passing his bill.|$|E
5|$|After Kieswetter's {{retirement}} from cricket, his father {{suggested that he}} {{take a break and}} play some golf. He had done so during his youth in South Africa, playing in provincial tournaments. After some lessons with David Leadbetter, who suggested that <b>he</b> <b>try</b> to become a professional golfer, Kieswetter began to enter amateur tournaments. After performing well in those events, he set himself a target of becoming a professional, and playing regularly on the European Tour. In late 2016, he took part in a couple of PGA EuroPro Tour tournaments and one on the MENA Golf Tour. In early 2017, he turned professional and in March played in the MENA Golf Tour qualifying school in Morocco, finishing tied for 31st place and earning a card for the 2017 season. He played regularly on the Tour during 2017 and in September won his biggest prize of the season, winning US$360 in the Dubai Creek Open after finishing tied for 38th place.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) has {{everyone}} stay late {{to cover}} for their co-workers in Florida, which turns into an awkward situation when Val's (Ameenah Kaplan) boyfriend, Brandon (Jerry Minor), arrives and accuses Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) of {{having an affair with}} her, after having read Darryl's text messages to her. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) demands that Darryl read them aloud out of voyeuristic interest. Upon hearing them, most of the staff agree that his text messages, particularly an extended ellipsis at the end of one, are suggestive of Darryl wanting to be with Val. Val protests that the idea of her being romantically involved with Darryl is ridiculous. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) suggests that <b>he</b> <b>try</b> a bold step, saying that if Jim had not made romantic advances while she was still engaged to Roy, she never would have ended up marrying him. Darryl follows her advice and tells Val that a potential relationship is not ridiculous.|$|E

6000|$|... "You know," [...] he began, and <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> {{to clear}} his throat. His voice was husky and strangulated with excitement. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> again: ...|$|R

25|$|Californian {{eventually}} responded. At around 5:30a.m., Chief Officer George Stewart awakened wireless operator Cyril Furmstone Evans, {{informed him}} that rockets had been seen during the night, and asked that <b>he</b> <b>try</b> to communicate with any ship. He got news of Titanics loss, Captain Lord was notified, and the ship set out to render assistance. She arrived well after Carpathia had already picked up all the survivors.|$|E

He impressed in the nets and {{was selected to}} play in a trial game, against the touring Australians. A shaky start saw him dismissed for a first-innings duck but he scored a century in the second-innings and was offered a Somerset contract.|$|E

He {{is a member of}} Sigma Chi fraternity {{and a member of the}} Trojan Knights.

Upon receiving a draft notice for the Vietnam War, Selleck joined the California National Guard. He served in the 160th Infantry Regiment of the California Army National Guard from 1967 to 1973.|$|E
60|$|There {{was much}} more said between them, but M. le Cure Gondin {{was not able to}} prevail in the least. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> to cajole her, and <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> to persuade by threats, and <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> to conquer her by {{gratitude}} and affection towards her uncle. But he could not prevail at all.|$|R

25|$|After the Allied {{liberation of}} Rome on 4 June 1944, Fellini and Enrico De Seta opened the Funny Face Shop where they survived the postwar {{recession}} drawing caricatures of American soldiers. He {{became involved with}} Italian Neorealism when Roberto Rossellini, at work on Stories of Yesteryear (later Rome, Open City), met Fellini in his shop, and proposed he contribute gags and dialogue for the script. Aware of Fellini’s reputation as Aldo Fabrizi’s “creative muse”, Rossellini also requested that <b>he</b> <b>try</b> to convince the actor {{to play the role}} of Father Giuseppe Morosini, the parish priest executed by the SS on 4 April 1944.|$|E
25|$|Evans {{left his}} family's farm in Westernville, New York at age 16 {{to work at}} a local garage in Rome, New York. After he found early success in street racing, then became a winner in drag racing, an {{associate}} suggested <b>he</b> <b>try</b> building a car to race at the nearby Utica-Rome Speedway. He ran his first oval-track car, a 1954 Ford Hobby Stock numbered PT-109 (after John F. Kennedy's torpedo boat in World War II), in 1962. He advanced to the Modifieds, the premier division, in 1965, winning his first feature in the season's final night.|$|E
25|$|While the {{caliphate}} {{continued its}} rapid expansion, Umar laid {{the foundations of}} a political structure that could hold it together. He created the Diwan, a bureau for transacting government affairs. The military was brought directly under state control and into its pay. Crucially, in conquered lands, Umar did not require that non-Muslim populations convert to Islam, nor did <b>he</b> <b>try</b> to centralize government. Instead, he allowed subject populations to retain their religion, language and customs, and he left their government relatively untouched, imposing only a governor (amir) and a financial officer called an amil. These new posts were integral to the efficient network of taxation that financed the empire.|$|E
50|$|Royale {{had been}} a drag {{performer}} for over two decades by the time <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> out for RuPaul's Drag Race season 4. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> out for the series as a dare.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>tried</b> again--I declare it positively, <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> again. [...] "You'll excuse me, sir? I've {{never seen}} his {{portfolio}} before. Am I right if I {{think you know}} where he keeps it?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tried</b> to cry out, but {{his voice}} was woefully weak and uncertain, and he soon gave up the effort. Then <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> again to walk, but had to desist in despair.|$|R
25|$|Daniel and Marty inform Khrone {{that they}} have no further need of his Baron Harkonnen and Paul Atreides gholas. They insist they have lured the Ithaca into a trap, and will soon have the Kwisatz Haderach they have {{calculated}} is on board. Khrone, however, continues to prepare the gholas. He finally manages to restore the Baron's memories, and instructs him to train the Paul ghola (named Paolo), who does not yet have his memories. To the Baron's disquiet, he finds the mocking voice of his granddaughter Alia in his thoughts soon after recovering his memories. She also later threatens him should <b>he</b> <b>try</b> to harm Paolo.|$|E
25|$|At age 20, Fonda {{started his}} acting {{career at the}} Omaha Community Playhouse, when his mother's friend Dodie Brando (mother of Marlon Brando) {{recommended}} that <b>he</b> <b>try</b> out for a juvenile part in You and I, {{in which he was}} cast as Ricky. He was fascinated by the stage, learning everything from set construction to stage production, and embarrassed by his acting ability. When he received the lead in Merton of the Movies, he realized the beauty of acting as a profession, as it allowed him to deflect attention from his own tongue-tied personality and create stage characters relying on someone else's scripted words. Fonda decided to quit his job and go east in 1928 to seek his fortune.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Harry and Marv {{realize that}} Kevin is home alone, and on Christmas Eve, Kevin overhears them {{discussing}} plans {{to break into}} his house that night. Kevin goes to church and watches a choir perform. He meets Old Man Marley, who sits with Kevin and they briefly speak; he learns that Marley is actually a nice man and that the rumors about him are false. He tells Kevin he is watching the choir because his granddaughter is singing, but he never gets to see her because he and his son are estranged and have not been on speaking terms for some time; Kevin suggests that <b>he</b> <b>try</b> to reconcile with his son.|$|E
50|$|His {{wife was}} angry with him, but <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> to knock pieces {{from his head}} for broth and had to take his bed. Then <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> {{lighting}} his fingers for candles, and again had to take to bed. Finally, <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> to fish, asking his wife whether his eyes were green; she claimed they were, he jumped in, and she rowed off and left him.|$|R

6000|$|Slowly, argumentatively, and reluctantly, Uncle Jim waded down-stream. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> threats, <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> persuasion, <b>he</b> even <b>tried</b> a belated note of pathos; Mr. Polly {{remained}} inexorable, if {{in secret}} a little perplexed {{as to the}} outcome of the situation. [...] "This cold's getting to my marrer!" [...] said Uncle Jim.|$|R
25|$|Her brother {{added that}} on the evening in question, {{he had heard the}} loud screams of one of his sisters moments after they had left his house and on running up Green Dragon Alley he found his sister Lucy on the ground in a fit, with her sister {{attempting}} to hold and support her. She was taken home, and he then learned from his other sister what had happened. She described Lucy's assailant as being of tall, thin, and gentlemanly appearance, covered in a large cloak, and carrying a small lamp or bull's eye lantern similar to those used by the police. The individual did not speak nor did <b>he</b> <b>try</b> to lay hands on them, but instead walked quickly away. Every effort was made by the police to discover the author of these and similar outrages, and several persons were questioned, but were set free.|$|E
25|$|Herb Stempel was a {{contestant}} on Twenty One who was {{coached by}} the show's producer Dan Enright. While Stempel {{was in the}} midst of his winning streak, both of the $64,000 quiz shows were in the top-ten rated programs but Twenty One did not have the same popularity. Enright and his partner Albert Freedman were searching for a new champion to replace Stempel to boost ratings. They soon found what they were looking for in Charles Van Doren. Van Doren was an English teacher at Columbia University when a friend suggested <b>he</b> <b>try</b> out for a quiz show. Van Doren decided to try out for the quiz show Tic-Tac-Dough. Enright, who produced both Tic-Tac-Dough and Twenty One, saw Van Doren's tryout and was familiar with his prestigious family background that included multiple Pulitzer Prize-winning authors and highly respected professors at Columbia University. As a result, Enright felt that Van Doren would be the perfect contestant to be the new face of Twenty One.|$|E
25|$|Returning to Britain, {{he found}} that the climate made him sick, leading him to {{register}} with a doctor, Edward A.Gregg, who recommended that <b>he</b> <b>try</b> nudism. Hesitant at first, Gardner first attended an in-door nudist club, the Lotus League in Finchley, North London, where he made several new friends and felt that the nudity cured his ailment. When summer came, he decided to visit an outdoor nudist club, that of Fouracres near the town of Bricket Wood in Hertfordshire, which he soon began to frequent. Through nudism, Gardner made a number of notable friends, including James Laver (1899–1975), who became the Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and Cottie Arthur Burland (1905–1983), who was the Curator of the Department of Ethnography at the British Museum. Biographer Philip Heselton suggested that through the nudist scene Gardner may have also met Dion Byngham (1896–1990), {{a senior member of the}} Order of Woodcraft Chivalry who propounded a Contemporary Pagan religion known as Dionysianism. By the end of 1936, Gardner was finding his Charing Cross Road flat to be cramped, and moved into the block of flats at 32a Buckingham Palace Mansions.|$|E
60|$|But {{his first}} {{attempts}} were unsuccessful. He wanted ammunition. To {{go to the}} plains without ammunition was obviously useless. He wanted food--sugar, tea, flour, pork. To go to the plains without these would be dreary work. But men knew La Certe's character, and refused him. One after another <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> his friends. Then <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> them again. Then <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> comparative strangers. <b>He</b> could not <b>try</b> his enemies, for, strange to say, he had none. Then he went over them all again.|$|R

Then <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> the shoes on his feet, and there never was such a fit. So he was clad in all his new clothes from top to toe, whereupon he began dancing until he made the ashes on the hearth spin around with him {{as though they had}} gone mad, and, as he danced, he sang: ...|$|R
500|$|Kurt attends {{his first}} meeting with the Dalton Academy Warblers.

During his audition, Owens noted, [...] "Chris said, 'Okay, {{did you ever see}} Elephant Man?... What I'm looking for is dignity. He's got dignity. But he's definitely mutated'". After Owens heeded Carter's instructions and attempted to bring dignity to the audition, Carter requested that <b>he</b> <b>try</b> it again [...] "with less autism".|$|E
