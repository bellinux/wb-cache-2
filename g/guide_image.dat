However, the application of hyperspectral data is still challengeable due to “the curse of dimensionality”.

30|$|Until recently, {{there were}} several works {{utilizing}} the gradient fidelity-based prior in image processing [12 – 15]. In [14], Fattal et al. presented a method for rendering high dynamic range (HDR) compression. After manipulating the gradient field of images by attenuating the magnitudes of large gradients, they proposed a gradient fidelity-based functional to reconstruct the result image from the modified gradient information in the least square sense. In [12], Didas et al. combined ℓ 2 data and gradient fitting in conjunction with ℓ 1 regularization for image denoising, where the gradient fidelity term is used {{to compensate for the}} loss of edge and undesirable staircase effect introduced by the resulting higher partial differential equation. In [13], Xu and Jia used one previously predicted sharp edge gradient as a spatial prior to guide the recovery of a coarse version of the latent image for robust motion deblurring. All the methods above could be considered as constructing an image from the specific gradient fields, and their motivations are quite different to ours. The authors in [12] aimed to recover the true image by minimizing gradient fidelity term between the corrupted image and the solution. The authors in [13] and [14] first used some filters to produce a <b>guide</b> <b>image</b> and then applied gradient fidelity term between the <b>guide</b> <b>image</b> and the solution.|$|E

40|$|Recovering a sharp {{version of}} an input blurred image is {{challenging}} in computational photography and digital image processing. Recent progresses {{have been made in}} algorithms to address the ill-posedness of the problem. Yet, the results are imperfect. This thesis presents two approaches that explore latent priors from observations to provide a better condition for image deblurring. The first approach is to use an additional correlated image. The input is a pair of images, one is blurry and the other is noisy. By combining the information from two degraded images, we are able to estimate a very accurate blur kernel and to restore a high-quality original image, which is not possible from single image deblurring or single image denoising. In addition, we present a more general framework of image deblurring with multiple correlative images, which go beyond the blurred/noisy image pair for a sequence of blurred images. Our approach is based on the assumptions that all blurred images caused by different blurs are derived from the same original image and that different blurs result in the loss of different frequency components during imaging. By fusing information from complementary frequency components, ambiguous solutions in both kernel estimation and image restoration can be further eliminated. Another prominent problem in image deblurring with multiple images is how to accurately align image pairs. Using the sparseness prior of blur kernels, a novel method is proposed to align multiple images in a fully automatic manner. Thus the method of image deblurring becomes effective and practical for the pictures captured under dim light conditions by a hand-held camera. The second approach is to choose the prior of sharp image structure. In image deblurring with blurred/noisy image pair, the noisy image acted as the <b>guide</b> <b>image</b> to provide large-scale and sharp edges to accurately estimate a blur kernel and restore a high-quality image. This insight can be further applied to single image deblurring. As we observed, the reconstructed image usually contains unpleasant ringing artifacts, due to the ill-posedness of image deconvolution even if the blur kernel was the ground truth. To suppress ringing artifacts and preserve recovered signals, we require the <b>guide</b> <b>image</b> to distinguish between texture regions and flat regions. Thus, we develop an inter-scale and intra-scale deconvolution framework to progressively recover such a <b>guide</b> <b>image,</b> which is then used to adaptively suppress ringing artifacts in texture regions and flat regions. Our progressive deconvolution approach can produce very promising results not only in synthetic experiments, but also in various real scenarii. The intensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques and have wide applications in scientific and digital entertainment fields...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an introduction to}} novel saliency-aware weighting and edge-aware weighting for HDR images. These techniques are incorporated into an existing <b>guided</b> <b>image</b> filter to form a perceptually <b>guided</b> <b>image</b> filter. The saliency-aware weighting and the new filter are applied to design a new local tone-mapping algorithm for HDR images such that both extreme light and shadow regions can be reproduced on conventional low dynamic range displays. The Visual-Salience-Based Tone Mapping (VSBTM) filter preserves sharp edges in the base layer better than the existing guided filter. Halo artifacts are thus significantly reduced in the tone-mapped image. Moreover, the visual quality of the tone-mapped image, especially attention-salient regions, is improved by the saliency-aware weighting. Pseudo-Multiple-Exposure-Based Tone Fusion (PMEBTF) gives a region-based enhancement on the pseudo-exposures to boost details in the most distinct region.

Gaussian and Weighted guided filter is using in the method. This method {{is based on the}} dark channel prior and a common haze image model and two filters. In order to eliminate halo artifacts first, we use a low pass Gaussian filter. To refine the coarse estimated atmospheric veil, also we use this filter. We can redefine the transmission, for preventing the color distortion of the recovered images in the output; Gaussian filter is based on local optimized edge-preserving smoothing technique. But this filter suffers from halo artifacts and gradient reversal. So a weighted <b>guided</b> <b>image</b> filter (WGIF) is introduced by adding an edge aware weighting into an existing <b>guided</b> <b>image</b> filter (GIF) to increase the Naturalness and Sharpness along with visual clarity.

However these methods do {{not take advantage of}} the correlation of the images from different sensors to improve the resolution of image. To solve this problem, in this paper a method is proposed to enhance infrared image by using the correlation of an infrared (IR) image and its corresponding visible image. Firstly, phase congruency is used to generate the edge maps of the infrared and visible images. Then, correlated edge regions and uncorrelated regions are calculated according to the edge maps. Finally, different strategies are applied to those regions. Specifically, for the correlated regions, the visible image is considered as the guidance image while for uncorrelated regions, the infrared image itself is considered as the guidance <b>image.</b> Hereafter <b>guided</b> <b>image</b> filter is applied to the infrared image.
