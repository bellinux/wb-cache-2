5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide. Long-term use is controversial {{because of concerns about}} adverse psychological and physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health. The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications <b>for</b> <b>older</b> <b>adults.</b>|$|E

25|$|It {{is worth}} noting that there are factors other than true attentional {{abilities}} that might relate to difficulty paying attention.

25|$|There {{are special}} risks to {{consider}} <b>for</b> <b>older</b> <b>adults,</b> {{women who are}} pregnant, and babies. When a person ages, the body becomes less able to rid itself of barbiturates. As a result, people {{over the age of}} sixty-five are at higher risk of experiencing the harmful effects of barbiturates, including drug dependence and accidental overdose. When barbiturates are taken during pregnancy, the drug passes through the placenta to the fetus. After the baby is born, it may experience withdrawal symptoms and have trouble breathing. In addition, nursing mothers who take barbiturates may transmit the drug to their babies through breast milk. A rare adverse reaction to barbiturates is Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which primarily affects the mucous membranes.|$|E
25|$|Another {{problem with}} elderspeak is that {{licensed}} practical nurses, registered nurses, and other healthcare team professionals very seldom have training and expertise {{when it comes}} to communication with elders, and that elderspeak is often used incorrectly. Shorter sentences appear to have a beneficial effect on older adults’ communication, factors of elderspeak such as slow speech and exaggerated pitch tend to make older persons feel worse about their own competency, as well as the competency of the speaker; However, younger adults continue to use elderspeak with these characteristics. Not only does elderspeak fail to improve communication effectiveness <b>for</b> <b>older</b> <b>adults,</b> the messages inherent in elderspeak may unknowingly reinforce dependency and engender isolation and depression, contributing to the spiral of decline in physical, cognitive, and functional status common for elderly individuals.|$|E

40|$|The {{discharge}} of single motor units (n = 34) {{in the first}} dorsal interosseus muscle and the fluctuations in force during steady contractions were measured {{across a range of}} index finger abduction forces in <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> (77. 1 +/- 6. 9 yr, n = 20). These results were compared with previously reported data on 38 motor units from young adults (25. 7 +/- 5. 7 yr).

2500|$|Although studies {{justify the}} notion that people often do not {{contribute}} to online communities, some research shows that older adults are actually more likely to participate in online communities than younger people because different generations tend {{to use the internet}} differently. For example, [...] "older adults are more likely to seek health information, make purchases, and obtain religious information, but less likely to watch videos, download music, play games, and read blogs online". This is perhaps {{due in part to the}} fact that some online communities cater to older generations. The content of the website often determines what age group will use or visit the site, and because many forms of online communities appear on sites that focus their attention on older adults, participation is generally higher. Additionally, the ease and availability of operating the websites that host the online community may play a role in the age group that is most likely to participate. For example, some online communities geared toward older adults have simplified the design of their sites in order to enhance their look and usability <b>for</b> <b>older</b> <b>adults.</b>|$|E

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the contribution of}} supraspinal fatigue to muscle fatigue in <b>old</b> and young <b>adults.</b> Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of motor cortex {{was used to assess}} voluntary activation during maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of elbow flexor muscles in 17 young adults (25. 5 ± 3. 6 yr; mean ± SD) and 7 <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> (73. 0 ± 3. 3 yr). Subjects performed a fatigue task involving six sustained MVCs (22 -s duration, separated by 10 s). Young adults exhibited greater reductions in maximal voluntary torque (67 ± 15 % of baseline) than the old (37 ± 6 %; P < 0. 001). Increments in torque (superimposed twitch) generated by TMS during sustained MVCs increased for the young and old (P < 0. 001) but were larger <b>for</b> the <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> {{at the start of the}} sustained contractions and during recovery (P < 0. 05). Voluntary activation was less <b>for</b> the <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> at the start of some sustained contractions and during recovery (P = 0. 02). Motor-evoked potential area increased similarly with age during the fatiguing task but was greater <b>for</b> the <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> than young during recovery.

At the end of the fatiguing task, peak relaxation rate of muscle fibers had declined more in the young than the <b>old</b> <b>adults.</b> The greater endurance with age is largely due to a difference in mechanisms located within the muscle.

2500|$|Also {{effective}} in 2006, the Connector Board set premium levels and copayments {{for the state}} subsidized Commonwealth Care plans. Premiums will vary from $18 per month, for individuals with incomes 100%–150% of the poverty line, to $106 per month for individuals with incomes 250%–300% of poverty. The Connector approved two copayment schemes for plans for people 200%–300% of poverty. One plan will have higher premiums and lower copayments, while a second choice will have lower premiums and higher copayments. Four managed care plans began offering Commonwealth Care on November 1, 2006. Coverage for people above 100% of poverty up to 300% of poverty began on February 1, 2007. As of December 1, 2007, around 158,000 people had been enrolled in Commonwealth Care plans. Initial bids received by the Connector showed a likely cost for the minimum insurance plan of about $380 per month. The Connector rejected those bids, and asked insurers to propose less expensive plans. New bids were announced on March 3, 2007. The Governor announced that [...] "the average uninsured Massachusetts resident {{will be able to}} purchase health insurance for $175 per month." [...] But plan costs will vary greatly depending on the plan selected, age and geographic location, ranging from just over $100 per month for plans for young adults with high copayments and deductibles to nearly $900 per month for comprehensive plans <b>for</b> <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> with low deductibles and copayments. Copayments, deductibles and out-of-pocket contributions may vary among plans. The proposed minimum creditable coverage plan would have a deductible no higher than $2,000 per individual, $4,000 per family, and would limit out-of-pocket expenses to a $5,000 maximum for an individual and $7,500 for a family. Before the deductible applies, the proposed plan includes preventive office visits with higher copayments, but would not include emergency room visits if the person was not admitted.|$|E
2500|$|Age is an {{important}} factor when considering TOT states. There are complaints that problems recalling information increases with age. The frequency of TOTs increases in adulthood and even more so during the elderly years. Compared with young adults, older adults generally report having more TOT states, fewer alternate words, and less phonological information about the target word. The underpinnings of TOT with regard to age have focused on neurological brain differences. Current research uses neuroimaging methods to access the presence of different brain patterns when a younger and older individual is experiencing a TOT state. It is found that older and younger individuals employ a similar network of brain regions during TOT states such as the prefrontal cortex, left insula, and sensorimotor cortex. However, older individuals show differences in activity in some areas compared to younger individuals. TOTs increase with age-related gray matter loss in the left insula for older individuals. [...] This is accompanied by less activity in the left insula and is related to higher frequency of TOTs. Furthermore, it was found that older individuals have over-activation in their prefrontal cortex when experiencing TOT states. This may indicate a continued search when the retrieval process fails and a TOT state is experienced. More specifically, greater activation in the sensorimotor cortex in older individuals and less in younger adults may reflect differences in the knowledge that is used to retrieve the target information. Priming words during word retrieval tests generally reduces the frequency of TOTs and improves the retrieval of the target word and has been shown to have a larger benefit <b>for</b> <b>older</b> <b>adults.</b> This is consistent with the spreading activation model, where neural connections are strengthened when used more. [...] Although older people experience more tip of the tongue states more often than any other category, [...] recent studies have shown that frequent tip of the tongue states are not linked at all to dementia, which is common in the elderly. Despite the association of increased age with lower levels of episodic memory and more frequent TOT states, the two phenomena seem to be largely independent of one another.|$|E
