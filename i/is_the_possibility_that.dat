5|$|Self-harm is not {{typically}} suicidal behaviour, although there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> a self-inflicted injury {{may result in}} life-threatening damage. Although the person may not recognise the connection, self-harm often becomes a response to profound and overwhelming emotional pain that cannot be resolved in a more functional way.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} of being entertained {{has come to be}} strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.|$|E
5|$|Practicing correct sexual {{practices}} was one method of perfecting the body's internal spirits. The Celestial Masters believed that semen is {{the embodiment of}} qi. If someone ejaculated too often, their life would be shortened. In fact, the Xiang'er indicates that people should not even have sex {{for the purposes of}} reproduction. The Celestial Masters frowned upon the practice of heqi (also known as 'The Union of the Breaths') of not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain', and advocated non-ejaculation simply as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced. Despite their opposition to 'heqi' and reproductive sex, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the Celestial Masters supported sex for purposes other than reproduction, and a Celestial Master text from around the 5th century describes an elaborate sexual ritual.See Kalinowski(1985) for a full description of the ritual.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} project became controversial as environmental protection non-governmental organizations (NGOs) drew public {{attention to a}} possible threat that may arise to seven species of bats. Subsequently, the NGOs alleged that the project is illegal, environmentally unsafe, financially not feasible, and technically questionable. Project legality was disputed because {{it is based on}} a 1999 environmental impact assessment (EIA), while Croatian legislation requires that EIAs must not be more than two years old. Flooding of Vilina Cave is cited as an environmental concern, while the financial issues are based on previous cost overruns by Hrvatska elektroprivreda—the state-owned company planning the development—in other projects. One objection to the technical aspects of the project <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the groundwater may trigger earthquakes. Opponents of the project have urged the Prime Minister of Croatia to cancel development of the plant.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the atmospheric effects there are effects on the near-Earth space environment.

25|$|In {{the case}} of Mars there have been {{terrestrial}} observations of radio emission spectra that {{have been associated with}} Schumann resonances. The reported radio emissions are not of the primary electromagnetic Schumann modes, but rather of secondary modulations of the nonthermal microwave emissions from the planet at approximately the expected Schumann frequencies, and have not been independently confirmed to be associated with lightning activity on Mars. There <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> future lander missions could carry in situ instrumentation to perform the necessary measurements. Theoretical studies are primarily directed to parameterizing the problem for future planetary explorers.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{the mass}} {{can be said}} to be stylistically consistent, and {{certainly}} the chosen chants are all celebrations of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Also adding weight to the claim that the mass is cyclic <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the piece was written or assembled for performance at a specific celebration. The possibility that it was for the coronation of Charles V, which was once widely accepted, is thought unlikely in modern scholarship. The composer's intention that the piece be performed as one entire mass setting makes the Messe de Nostre Dame generally considered a cyclic composition.|$|E

25|$|The {{lands of}} Upper and Lower Egypt were united {{into a single}} kingdom {{sometime}} around 2686 BC. The period following the unification of the crowns was one of prosperity marked {{by the start of}} the Third Dynasty and the Old Kingdom of Egypt. The exact identity of the founder of the dynasty is a matter of debate due to the fragmentary nature of the records from the period. Djoser is one of the principal candidates for the founder of the Third Dynasty. Other candidates are Nebka and Sanakht. Complicating matters further <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> Nebka and Sanakht are referring to the same person.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1994 uprising, {{migration}} {{into the}} Lacandon Jungle has significantly increased, involving illegal settlements and cutting in the protected biosphere reserve. The Zapatistas support these actions {{as part of}} indigenous rights, but that has put them in conflict with international environmental groups and with the indigenous inhabitants of the rainforest area, the Lacandons. Environmental groups state that the settlements pose grave risks to {{what remains of the}} Lacandon, while the Zapatistas accuse them of being fronts for the government, which wants to open the rainforest up to multinational corporations. Added to this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> significant oil and gas deposits exist under this area.|$|E
25|$|The first {{definitive}} work (or {{at least}} oldest existent) on geometry in China was the Mo Jing, the Mohist canon {{of the early}} philosopher Mozi (470-390 BC). It was compiled {{years after his death}} by his followers around the year 330 BC. Although the Mo Jing is the oldest existent book on geometry in China, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> even older written material existed. However, due to the infamous Burning of the Books in a political maneuver by the Qin Dynasty ruler Qin Shihuang (r. 221-210 BC), multitudes of written literature created before his time were purged. In addition, the Mo Jing presents geometrical concepts in mathematics that are perhaps too advanced not to have had a previous geometrical base or mathematic background to work upon.|$|E

25|$|According to the Torah, {{the tribe}} {{consisted}} of descendants of Gad the seventh son of Jacob, from whom it took its name. However, some Biblical scholars view this {{also as a}} postdiction, an eponymous metaphor providing an aetiology of the connectedness of the tribe {{to others in the}} Israelite confederation. In the Biblical account, Gad is one of the two descendants of Zilpah, a handmaid of Jacob, the other descendant being Asher; scholars see this as indicating that the authors saw Gad and Asher as being not of entirely Israelite origin (hence descendants of handmaids rather than of full wives). In common with Asher <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the tribal name derives from a deity worshipped by the tribe, Gad being thought by scholars to be likely to have taken its name from Gad, the semitic god of fortune; the name of Gad does not appear in the Song of Deborah, which scholars regard as one of the oldest parts of the Bible, pre-dating most of the Torah.|$|E
25|$|The {{headquarters}} {{consisted of}} a number of buildings centered around two villas: Villa Rossi, which was inhabited by the Corps commander himself, and Villa Calvi, occupied by his Chief of Staff. The entire garrison {{consisted of a}}round 300 German soldiers. The assault itself would see the British SAS company and a number of Italians force their way into the two villas, while the Russian company would place themselves between the villas and the other buildings, preventing the rest of the garrison from intervening. The partisans were able to approach the villas without being spotted, quietly eliminating several sentries in the process. However, their plan to use their bazooka to gain entry to the villa was trashed when it misfired. They were able to reach the interior of the villa by force, but fierce German resistance meant they were unable to move upstairs and kill the Chief of Staff; they therefore used explosives, petrol and looted furniture to set the villa on fire, ensuring that the remaining Germans stayed inside with bursts of machine gun fire. Although effective, this conflagration meant that the Germans in Villa Rossi were alerted to the attack before the group of partisans attacking the villa could begin their assault; as in the other villa, the occupants put up a stiff resistance and stymied attempts by the partisans to reach the top floor. A number of Germans were killed in the firefight, however, and there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> one of these was the Corps commander. Under heavy fire, the partisans retreated after setting fire to the villa's kitchen.|$|E
500|$|Sahure's {{military}} career is known primarily from reliefs from his mortuary complex. It apparently consisted of campaigns against the Libyans in the Western desert. The campaigns yielded various livestock and Sahure is shown smiting [...] local chieftains. The Palermo stone corroborates {{some of these}} events and also mentions expeditions to Sinai and to the exotic land of Punt. However, this same scene of the Libyan attack was used two hundred years later in the mortuary temple of Pepi II (22842184 BC) and in the temple of Taharqa at Kawa, built some 1800 years after Sahure's lifetime. In particular, the same names are quoted for the local chieftains. Therefore, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> Sahure too was copying an even earlier representation of this scene.|$|E

500|$|Jake Adelstein, former crime {{reporter}} for the Yomiuri Shimbun, said these three acquired companies [...] "shared addresses and office space with several other companies with different names but sometimes the same employees, creating a web of real and paper companies that make tracking the money very difficult."

500|$|Parry {{was also}} {{involved}} in music-related publishing. [...] Beginning in 1861, he was a regular contributor of Tonic sol-fa material to the Welsh music journal, Y cerddor Cymreig. Parry's work with making Tonic sol-fa accessible allowed everyone {{with an interest in}} choral work to participate. He edited Cambrian Minstrelsie (A National Collection of Welsh Songs) in 1893. He also complied Dr Parry's Book of Songs, which was a collection of his own works, and wrote Elfenau Cerddoriaeth ("Elements of Music"), a Welsh handbook on theory, in 1888. In 1895, Parry entered into an agreement with an American music publishing firm, the John Church Company. The company published some of Parry's songs along with English translations of poems by Heinrich Heine. [...] The translations were done by poets of note, including James Thomson. Since it is doubtful that Parry was familiar with Heine's work, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> Parry was commissioned by the company to write the songs during an extensive US trip he had made the year before.|$|E
500|$|In general, the {{decision}} between clipping and coiling is {{made on the}} basis of the location of the aneurysm, its size and the condition of the person. Aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery and its related vessels are hard to reach with angiography and tend to be amenable to clipping. Those of the basilar artery and posterior cerebral artery are hard to reach surgically and are more accessible for endovascular management. These approaches are based on general experience, and the only randomized controlled trial directly comparing the different modalities was performed in relatively well people with small (less than 10mm) aneurysms of the anterior cerebral artery and anterior communicating artery (together the [...] "anterior circulation"), who constitute about 20 percent of all people with aneurysmal SAH. This trial, the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT), showed that in this group the likelihood of death or being dependent on others for activities of daily living was reduced (7.4 percent absolute risk reduction, 23.5 percent relative risk reduction) if endovascular coiling was used as opposed to surgery. The main drawback of coiling <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the aneurysm will recur; this risk is extremely small in the surgical approach. In ISAT, 8.3 percent needed further treatment in the longer term. Hence, people who have undergone coiling are typically followed up for many years afterwards with angiography or other measures to ensure recurrence of aneurysms is identified early. Other trials have also found a higher rate of recurrence necessitating further treatments.|$|E
