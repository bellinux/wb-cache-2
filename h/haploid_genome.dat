25|$|He {{also notes}} that koinophilia {{provides}} no explanation {{as to how the}} physiological, anatomical and genetic causes of reproductive isolation come about. It is only the behavioral reproductive isolation that is addressed by koinophilia. It is furthermore difficult to see how koinophilia might apply to plants, and certain marine creatures that discharge their gametes into the environment to meet up and fuse, it seems, entirely randomly (within conspecific confines). However, when pollen from several compatible donors is used to pollinate stigmata, the donors typically do not sire equal numbers of seeds. Marshall and Diggle state that the existence of some kind of non-random seed paternity is, in fact, not in question in flowering plants. It is how this occurs that remains unknown. Pollen choice is one of the possibilities, taking into account that 50% of the pollen grain’s <b>haploid</b> <b>genome</b> is expressed during its tube’s growth towards the ovule.|$|E

This paper {{is an extension of}} previous work on the subject, which considered the case of <b>haploid</b> <b>genomes.</b> Here, we develop a more general formulation of the quasispecies equations that is applicable to diploid and even polyploid genomes. Interestingly, with an appropriate classification of population fractions, we obtain a system of equations that is formally identical to the haploid case. As with the work for <b>haploid</b> <b>genomes,</b> we consider both random and immortal DNA strand chromosome segregation mechanisms. However, in contrast to the haploid case, we have found that an analytical solution for the mean fitness is considerably more difficult to obtain for the polyploid case. Accordingly, whereas for the haploid case we obtained expressions for the mean fitness for the case of an analogue of the single-fitness-peak landscape for arbitrary lesion repair probabilities (thereby allowing for non-complementary genomes), here we solve for the mean fitness for the restricted case of perfect lesion repair.

40|$|In {{the vast}} {{majority}} of sexual life cycles, fusion between single-celled gametes is directly followed by nuclear fusion, leading to a diploid zygote and a lifelong commitment between two <b>haploid</b> <b>genomes.</b> Mushroom-forming basidiomycetes differ in two key respects. First, the multicellular haploid mating partners are fertilized in their entirety, each cell being a gamete that simultaneously can behave as a female, i. e. contributing the cytoplasm to a zygote by accepting nuclei, and a male gamete, i. e. only donating nuclei to the zygote. Second, after gamete union, the two <b>haploid</b> <b>genomes</b> remain separate so that the main vegetative stage, the dikaryon, has two haploid nuclei per cell. Only when the dikaryon produces mushrooms, do the nuclei fuse to enter a short diploid stage, immediately followed by meiosis and haploid spore formation. So in basidiomycetes, gamete fusion and genome mixing (sex) are separated in time. The ‘living apart together’ of nuclei in the dikaryon maintains some autonomy for nuclei to engage in a relationship with a different nucleus. We show that competition among the two nuclei of the dikaryon for such ‘extramarital affairs’ may lead to genomic conflict by favouring genes beneficial {{at the level of the}} nucleus, but deleterious at that of the dikaryon. </p...|$|R

Thus, functional oocytes can be generated from male somatic cells after reprogramming and spontaneous sex reversal.

40|$|The {{majority}} of complete hydatidiform moles (CHMs) harbor duplicated <b>haploid</b> <b>genomes</b> that originate from sperm.

In the case of complete dominance, we observe that speciation requires stronger spatial inbreeding in comparison to the haploid model. For perfect codominance, instead, speciation demands stronger genetic assortativeness. Nevertheless, once speciation is established, the three models predict the same abundance distributions even at the quantitative level, revealing the robustness of the original mechanism to describe biodiversity features...|$|R
