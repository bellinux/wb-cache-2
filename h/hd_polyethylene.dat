40|$|During the {{reactive}} {{processing of}} <b>HD</b> <b>Polyethylene</b> molecules {{are known to}} form branched structures, eventually resulting in a MFI decrease. This phenomenon was studied by experiments in a twin-screw extruder and measurement of the MWD by SEC-MALS. A Monte Carlo simulation model has been setup to calculate the MWD and branching distribution. The model includes both branching and random scission. Branch points {{are assumed to be}} created by coupling of vinyl ends of linear PE to secondary radical sites on PE backbones, yielding tertiary radical sites that undergo termination by disproportionation. This mechanism was recently proposed by Camara et al. [1]. Comparing the computed MWD to SEC-MALS data allowed determining the kinetic coefficients of the branching and scission reactions. Random scission turns out to be weak but still significant to prevent the formation of an extended MWD tail. For the found parameters perfect agreement was found between measured and computed MWD for various initial peroxide concentrations. These findings contribute to a better fundamental understanding of the simultaneous branching and scission during PE modification. It forms a firm support of the vinyl end to secondary radical coupling branching mechanism. Furthermore, it is shown that the MC simulations provide explicit branching topologies as a basis for predicting, for instance, complex rheological behavior of the modified polymer melt (Read et al.

We discuss results for (i) the probability distribution of the mean-square chain end-to-end distance and its radius of gyration, (ii) the conformation tensor, (iii) the material functions in steady shear (viscosity, normal stress differences, nonequilibrium shear compliance, hydrostatic pressure), (iv) the flow birefringence, (v) the orientation angle and order parameter, (vi) the interaction energies and their relative importance, (vii) the intermolecular pair distribution function, and (viii) the intrinsic molecular shape of the chains (represented by the isosurface plots in terms of their monomer number density), all as a function of flow strength. A detailed primitive path (PP) analysis has allowed us to examine how the flow field alters the statistical properties of the underlying topological network of the melt (probability distribution functions and mean values of PP contour length, of the number and size of entanglement strands, etc.). Our results reveal significant distortions of all these distributions due to applied flow. One of the most important results of our work is that as the shear rate is increased, the average value of the contour length goes through a maximum and the number of entanglements per chain exhibits a shear-thinning behavior which bears many similarities with the corresponding behavior of the shear viscosity. Overall, most of the computed rheological properties of the C 400 H 802 melt change in a nonlinear way with the applied shear rate due to the simultaneous effect of (a) chain orientation and stretching, (b) chain rotation and tumbling under shear, and (c) chain disentanglement. close 292...|$|R

The investigations {{presented in this}} thesis deal with two basic topics of solid state NMR: coherent averaging of nuclear spin interactions by rf irradiation, {{and the application of}} thermodynamics in strongly time dependent interaction frames. In each case new theoretical insights are presented, and these lead to the development of new experiments. After a general introduction, an extension of coherent averaging theory called the principle of pulse cycle decoupling is presented. This principle greatly facilitates the design and analysis of compound experiments, i. e. techniques which are combinations of several smaller experiments. A number of multiple pulse experiments are analyzed using pulse cycle decoupling and several new techniques are introduced, including 24 -pulse and 52 -pulse cycles which have a greater ability to resolve anisotropic chemical shifts in solids than any experiment previously developed. The 52 -pulse cycle is used to measure proton chemical shift spectra for polycrystalline ice, C 6 H 12, C 5 <b>H</b> 10 and <b>polyethylene.</b> This new technique is also used to study proton chemical shifts in single crystals of gypsum, [ [...] . ]. The second topic considered in this thesis is the application of thermodynamics to NMR experiments in which the amplitude of the applied rf irradiation is varied in a strongly non-adiabatic fashion. Sources of artificial spin heating are analyzed and methods of eliminating these effects are demonstrated. A calculation is presented of the spin-lattice relaxation time during one basic type of multiple pulse irradiation. Techniques based on this calculation are introduced which measure relaxation times in the laboratory frame, [ [...] . ], and the rotating frame, [ [...] . ]. A method for determining the first moment of an NTIR spectrum is also developed. These new techniques are demonstrated using a variety of materials, including CaF 2 and C 6 F 6. A simple yet highly flexible pulse sequence generator which is capable of producing all the pulse sequences described in this thesis as well as many more complicated experiments is described in the Appendix...|$|R
40|$|Direct seeding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} methods in restoration ecology, but low field seedling emergence from pioneer tree seeds still reduces its large scale applicability. The aim of this research was to evaluate seed priming for the pioneer tree species Guazuma ulmifolia. Priming treatments were selected based on seed hydration curves in water and in PEG 8000 solution. Seeds were primed in water for 16 <b>h</b> and in <b>Polyethylene</b> glycol - PEG 8000 (- 0. 8 MPa for 56 and 88 h) at 20 ºC to reach approximately 30 % water content. Half of the seed sample of each treatment was dried back to the initial moisture content (7. 2 %); both dried and non-dried primed seeds as well as the unprimed seeds (control) were tested for germination (percentage and rate) and vigor (electrical conductivity of seed leachates). Seedling emergence percentage and rate were evaluated under greenhouse conditions, while seedling length and uniformity of seedling development were estimated using the automated image analysis software SVIS®. Primed seeds showed the highest physiological potential, which was mainly demonstrated by image analysis. Fresh or dried primed seeds in water for 16 h and in PEG (- 0. 8 MPa) for 56 h, and fresh primed seeds in PEG for 88 h, improved G. ulmifolia germination performance. It is suggested that these treatments were promising to enhance efficiency of stand establishment of this species by direct seeding in restoration ecology programs. A semeadura direta é um dos métodos mais promissores para a restauração ecológica, mas a baixa emergência de plântulas em campo a partir de sementes de árvores pioneiras ainda limita sua aplicabilidade em larga escala. Avaliou-se a resposta de sementes da espécie florestal pioneira Guazuma ulmifolia ao condicionamento fisiológico. Os tratamentos foram selecionados com base em curvas de hidratação em água e em solução osmótica de Polietilenoglicol - PEG 8000. As sementes foram condicionadas em água por 16 h e em PEG 8000 (- 0, 8 MPa por 56 e 88 h) a 20 ºC, atingindo teor de água de, aproximadamente, 30 %. Metade das amostras de cada tratamento foi secada até atingir teor de água próximo ao inicial (7, 2 %); em seguida, avaliou-se o desempenho das sementes condicionadas submetidas ao não à secagem, além de sementes não condicionadas (testemunha), quanto à germinação (porcentagem e velocidade) e o vigor (condutividade elétrica dos exudatos das sementes). A porcentagem e a velocidade de emergência de plântulas foram avaliadas em condições de casa de vegetação, enquanto que o comprimento de plântulas e a uniformidade de desenvolvimento das plântulas foram estimados usando o software de análise computadorizada de imagens de plântulas SVIS®. As sementes condicionadas fisiologicamente apresentaram potencial fisiológico superior, demonstrado principalmente pelos resultados da análise de imagens. Assim, as sementes condicionadas em água durante 16 h ou em PEG durante 88 h, ambas não submetidas à secagem subsequente, e as condicionadas em PEG durante 56 h e submetidas a secagem, beneficiaram o desempenho germinativo de G. ulmifolia. Sugere-se que esses tratamentos são promissores para aumentar a eficiência de estabelecimento de estande dessa espécie via semeadura direta em programas de restauração ecológica...|$|R
40|$|School of Molecular Sciences(Chemical Engineering) The slip {{phenomenon}} that fluids have a nonzero velocity on static wall {{is very common}} in confined polymeric systems and {{plays a crucial role}} in polymer processing, lubrication, adhesion, coating, and etc. In particular, the surface instability induced by the wall slip in polymer extrusion processes has been a most important issue in polymer industries, since it significantly restricts the production rate within a certain low range. In addition, it has been well known that the fluid slip at the wall can make a considerable influence on the rheological properties of a confined polymer system in comparison to the corresponding bulk properties. Although numerous researches appeared in the past regarding the slip phenomenon, there still remains a critical lack of molecular-level understanding on structural and dynamical behaviors of polymer chains at interface under an external flow field. In this work, we carried out a comprehensive and detailed study on the fundamental molecular mechanism and dynamics of polymer melt near the interface under shear flow using atomistic nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation of unentangled C 30 H 62 and entangled C 178 <b>H</b> 358 linear <b>polyethylene</b> (PE) melts confined to a nanometer scale system. The slip phenomena were analyzed in detail with a particular effort in revealing the underlying origins in the microscopic level. For all the polymer systems studied here, we found that there exist three distinctive regimes in terms of the degree of slip (ds). In the 1 st regime where the flow strength is small, ds appears to keep increasing with increasing shear rate for both C 30 and C 178 PE melts. The behavior is associated with the chain rotation from the neutral direction to the flow direction, which effectively lowers the frictional force between polymer chains and the wall and thus promotes the fluid slip. In the 2 nd regime with an intermediate flow strength, ds exhibits a rather plateau in the case of C 30 PE melt and a decreasing behavior in the case of C 178 PE melt. This regime is characterized as a dynamically stable range in chain rotation and tumbling mechanisms through a competition between the wall friction against the slip of adsorbed chains and the movement of adsorbed chains in the flow direction enhanced by the surrounding bulk chains promoting the slip. In addition, in the case of C 178 PE melt, it is found that the degree of entanglement between adsorbed chains and the surrounding chains becomes weaker with increasing shear rate, leading to a decrease of momentum transfer from the surrounding chains to adsorbed chains and thus the decrease of ds. This effect is considered to be particularly important in interfacial slip for long, entangled polymer systems. With a further increase of shear rate (in the 3 rd regime), ds turns out to increase for both C 30 and C 178 PE melts. In this regime, polymer chains at interface experience a large amount of strong collisions {{with each other and with}} the wall atoms, resulting in chains get out of interfacial region. This induces less energetically favorable wall-fluid interaction thus, slip increases. Also we derived a parameter expressed by microscopic conformation of interfacial chains which can demonstrate origin of slip at atomic-level. And trend of the parameter is well-fitted with degree of slip. The understanding confined fluid in microscopic level would help to give fundamental intuition with regard to application of confined fluid such as thin film or biological membranes etc. And one may control degree of slip depending on various application process based on origin of slip at atomic-level. ope...|$|R
