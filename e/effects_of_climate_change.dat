5|$|The {{survival}} {{of this species}} is tied closely to rainfall because of the susceptibility of seedlings to drought. It is thus especially vulnerable to the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> <b>change.</b> This was recognised as early as 1992, when {{it was noted that}} winter rainfall in the Quairading region had been falling by about 4% per decade, and that a continuation of this trend may reduce the species' distribution. Recently, a more thorough assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to extinction, and mild change to a reduction of its range by 80% by 2080. However, there may not be any range reduction at all under mid-severity climate change, depending on how effectively this species can migrate into newly habitable areas.|$|E

40|$|Question: What is the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> on {{tree species}} {{abundance}} and {{distribution in the}} Italian peninsula? Location: Italian peninsula. Methods: Regression tree analysis, Random Forest, generalized additive model and geostatistical methods were compared to identify the best model for quantifying the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> on tree species distribution and abundance. Future potential species distribution, richness, local colonization, local extinction and species turnover were modelled according to two scenarios (A 2 and B 1) for 2050 and 2080. Results: Robust Random Forest {{proved to be the}} best statistical model to predict the potential distribution of tree species abundance. <b>Climate</b> <b>change</b> could lead to a shift in tree species distribution towards higher altitudes and a reduction of forest cover. Pinus sylvestris and Tilia cordata may be considered at risk of local extinction, while the other species could find potential suitable areas at the cost of a rearrangement of forest community composition and increasing competition. Conclusions: Geographical and topographical regional characteristics can have a noticeable influence on the impact <b>of</b> predicted <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> on forest ecosystems within the Mediterranean basin.
