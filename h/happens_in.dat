5|$|Helicoverpa zea is {{the most}} common and {{destructive}} pest of soybean growth in Virginia. About one-third of Virginia acreage is treated annually with pounds of insecticide, costing farmers around 2 million dollars. The degree of damage varies {{on the size of the}} pest infestation, the timing, and the stage of the plant. However, soybean plants are capable of withstanding a large amount of damage without substantial yield loss depending on soil moisture, planting date, and weather. If the damage is early in the plants life, then damage will mostly be to the leaves. Plants compensate for the damage by processes such as increasing seed size in remaining pods. Most damage <b>happens</b> <b>in</b> August, when the plants are flowering. Attacks that happen after August do much less damage because many pods have developed tougher walls that H. zea can't penetrate. Infestations that affect pod formation and seed filling have the potential to reduce yields, and because this <b>happens</b> <b>in</b> the later stages of plants, they have less time to compensate.|$|E

5|$|Saltwater fish tend to lose water {{because of}} osmosis. Their kidneys return {{water to the}} body.

5|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment for}} cholangitis is relief {{of the underlying}} biliary obstruction. This is usually deferred until 24–48hours after admission, when the patient is stable and has shown some improvement with antibiotics, but may need to happen as an emergency in case of ongoing deterioration despite adequate treatment, or if antibiotics are not effective in reducing the signs of infection (which <b>happens</b> <b>in</b> 15% of cases).|$|E

5|$|Archaea {{exhibit a}} great variety of {{chemical}} reactions in their metabolism and use many sources of energy. These reactions are classified into nutritional groups, depending on energy and carbon sources. Some archaea obtain energy from inorganic compounds such as sulfur or ammonia (they are lithotrophs). These include nitrifiers, methanogens and anaerobic methane oxidisers. In these reactions one compound passes electrons to another (in a redox reaction), releasing energy to fuel the cell's activities. One compound acts as an electron donor and one as an electron acceptor. The energy released is used to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through chemiosmosis, the same basic process that <b>happens</b> <b>in</b> the mitochondrion of eukaryotic cells.|$|E

Cold wind and heavy rain has <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> Hokuriku region. Elsewhere, the abnormal patters of heavy rain, flooding, drought, frost (<b>in</b> particular, frost <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> Akita in August) and insect damage has drained food reserves on markets to zero.

Items and equipment, which include new armor and weapons alongside healing potions, are acquired from defeated enemies or purchased from merchants. Players of the original Titan Quest can import their current selected character into Immortal Throne, while new players must complete the main campaign before accessing Immortal Throne.|$|E
5|$|Experimentation {{with real}} bikes {{has so far}} {{confirmed}} the weave mode predicted by the eigenvalues. It was found that tire slip and frame flex are not important for the lateral dynamics of the bicycle in the speed range up to 6 m/s. The idealized bike model {{used to calculate the}} eigenvalues shown here does not incorporate any of the torques that real tires can generate, and so tire interaction with the pavement cannot prevent the capsize mode from becoming unstable at high speeds, as Wilson and Cossalter suggest <b>happens</b> <b>in</b> the real world.|$|E
5|$|Formation of {{the carbon}} atomic nucleus {{requires}} a nearly simultaneous triple collision of alpha particles (helium nuclei) within {{the core of a}} giant or supergiant star which is known as the triple-alpha process, as the products of further nuclear fusion reactions of helium with hydrogen or another helium nucleus produce lithium-5 and beryllium-8 respectively, both of which are highly unstable and decay almost instantly back into smaller nuclei. This <b>happens</b> <b>in</b> conditions of temperatures over 100 megakelvin and helium concentration that the rapid expansion and cooling of the early universe prohibited, and therefore no significant carbon was created during the Big Bang.|$|E

5|$|Subarachnoid blood can be {{detected}} on CT scanning {{in as many as}} 60 percent of people with traumatic brain injury. Traumatic SAH (tSAH) usually occurs near the site of a skull fracture or intracerebral contusion.

It is unclear, however, if this {{is a direct result of}} the SAH or whether the presence of subarachnoid blood is simply an indicator of severity of the head injury and the prognosis is determined by other associated mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|The skin colour of {{amphibians}} {{is produced}} by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophores. These three cell layers consist of the melanophores (occupying the deepest layer), the guanophores (forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules, producing a blue-green colour) and the lipophores (yellow, the most superficial layer). The colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland. Unlike bony fish, {{there is no direct}} control of the pigment cells by the nervous system, and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than <b>happens</b> <b>in</b> fish. A vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators.|$|E
