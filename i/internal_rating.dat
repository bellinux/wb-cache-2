40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to present theoretical, methodological and {{practical}} aspects of <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> model’s validation for commercial banks and quantify potential impact of foundation internal ratings based approach on financial performance of banks. The quality and the explanatory ability of <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> systems can be different. Models used to measure credit risk are not perfect and give quite unreliable results, respectively; they contribute to the procyclical tendencies of the financial system. This article was based on the assumption that a suitably chosen rating system can significantly support long-term profitability and competitiveness of commercial banks. One part of the article also presents methodology of additional profitability on equity of the bank due to the usage of <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> models. The analyses has proved that the usage of <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> models increase profitability through substantial savings in equity, which allows the banks to accelerate lending activities in the banking practice. A comparison of standardized approach and foundation <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> based approach demonstrates that requirement of equity capital can be decreased from 30 to 40 %. Under the condition of the anticipated savings in equity of 30 %, the usage of <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> model could increase the profitability on equity up to 13 %, depending on the structure of assets, amount of the interest margins and profitability ratio [...] Future usage of <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> based approach is quite uncertain since it has shown its procyclical character and has significantly contributed to the acceleration of the global financial crisis by lower capital requirement. However, <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> based approach implementation is very intensive in the credit risk management of the bank, therefore there is rather suggested a gentle modification in this area and not a complete elimination. It has been considered a neccessity to reassess its status in area of solvency, because of its intensive impact on reduction of equity capital...|$|E

The appropriate minimum rate {{to maximize the}} value added to the firm is the cost of capital, i.e. the <b>internal</b> <b>rate</b> of return of a new capital project needs to be higher than the company's cost of capital.

40|$|For large {{financial}} institutions, {{credit risk}} {{has been the}} biggest problem of its development. At present, the credit risk management in the international large-scale financial institutions has formed {{a complete set of}} theoretical system and measurement model. Compared with them, there is still a big gap between China's and foreign financial institutions and commercial banks in this area. Therefore, the measurement and evaluation of the credit risk of China's commercial banks is a topic of concern and discussion in the academic and financial system. How to make more effective management of credit risk and constantly improve the efficiency of credit risk management of commercial banks is also one of popular topics of extensive research. This paper analyzes the current situation of credit risk management of C bank Chongqing branch in China, and makes use of the KMV model to evaluate the credit of some customers of the bank. Compare the evaluation results with the results of the bank's <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> system, and find the problems in the credit risk management and <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> of C bank Chongqing branch. The main difference between KMV model and <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> in C bank Chongqing branch is that the data for KMV model is more dynamic. The analysis of the customer combined with every point in the stock market, bond market and the variability of foreign exchange market. So it’s more accurate and timely. On the contrary, the timeliness of the <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> method is poor. It is mainly based on static customer financial data, audit reports and other customer rating. Although it is also able to better reflect the customer's credit situation, it cannot quickly and accurately grasp the trend of customer change {{due to the lack of}} timeliness. From this dissertation, we found that the strengthening of commercial bank credit risk supervision and management has some significance in the development of China's credit risk areas. Also, determine the cause and level of credit risk is the foundation of credit risk measurement management. Based on the analysis of KMV model, it is found that the model can improve and supplement the <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> system of C bank Chongqing branch, and strengthen the dynamic monitoring and timeliness of the <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> system...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the Basel II Capital Accord has encouraged financial institu-tions to build <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> systems assessing the credit risk of their various credit portfolios. One of the key outputs of an <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> system is the probability of default (PD), which reflects {{the likelihood that a}} counterparty will default on his/her financial obligation. Since the PD modeling problem basically boils down to a discrimination problem (defaulter or not), one may rely on the myriad of clas-sification techniques that have been suggested in the literature. However, since the credit risk models will be subject to supervisory review and evaluation, they must be easy to understand and transparent. Hence, techniques such as neural networks or support vector machines are less suitable due to their black box nature. Building upon previous research, we will use AntMiner+ to build <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> systems for credit risk.

40|$|The most {{commonly}} cited drawback {{to using the}} <b>internal</b> <b>rate</b> of return to evaluate deterministic cash flow streams {{is the possibility of}} multiple conflicting <b>internal</b> <b>rates,</b> or no <b>internal</b> <b>rate</b> at all.

There is, moreover, no need to carefully examine a cash flow stream to rule out the possibility of multiple <b>internal</b> <b>rates,</b> or to throw out or ignore “unreasonable ” rates. What we show is that when there are multiple (or even complex-valued) <b>internal</b> <b>rates,</b> each has a meaningful interpretation as a rate of return on its own underlying investment stream. It does not matter which rate is used to accept or reject the cash flow stream, as long as one identifies the underlying investment stream as a net investment or net borrowing.

In the case study the accuracy of a concrete rating model has been experimentally confirmed, which is used by commercial bank in the Czech Republic for the segment of small and medium-sized enterprises. <b>Internal</b> <b>rating</b> models represent banks' effort to assess objectively the credit quality of the borrower. Previous experiences from banking sector show that this process is necessary to optimize by adding other activities because the quality of this rating models is limited. Aim of our experiment was to verify the quality of concrete <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> model, which is used by concrete bank in Czech Republic to assess the quality of borrowers in the small and medium sized-enterprises. Results of our experiment are surprising. The model evaluates an excellent company as a negative subject. The model is less sensitive on significant changes in key financial indicators to determine the loan repayment. Our experiment has been proved the fact, that the most important impact on the level of company's final rating has the financial parameter - profit. Other parameters like assets, revenues and long-term liabilities have demonstrated only minimal impact on the level of company's final rating...|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of Basel II, credit {{migration}} matrices have become major components in credit risk management. This thesis is an empirical investigation of various issues that arise {{in the analysis of}} credit rating migration. Using the unique and rich <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> data of a Canadian SME loan portfolio, the thesis investigates credit rating migration from different perspectives. More specifically, the thesis compares and analyzes three multi-state Markov chain estimation methods of migration matrices to accommodate the special features of the <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> data. The drivers of differences among the three competing methods are investigated theoretically. The statistical and economical differences are examined through non-parametric bootstrap and credit VaR techniques respectively. The underlying assumptions of the three competing methods, time homogeneous first-order Markov chain, are then examined. In the final chapter, the thesis adopts a one-factor model and applies it to our unique <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> data to forecast migration matrices conditioning on macroeconomic variables. The forecasts are based on different estimation methods of migration matrices. We illustrate {{the extent to which a}} one-factor migration matrix could improve the accuracy of the credit loss distribution.

The quality of these estimates depends critically on the availability and completeness of time series of default and rating data. This paper studies PD estimation when ratings are missing for some obligors and periods in internal data sets. We argue that a within-bank incentive conflict can result in ratings systematically missing for obligors in financial distress. Using <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> data from a German bank, it is shown that the widely used “cohort” PD estimator, ie, the long-run average of one-year realized default rates, which simply ignores missing ratings, yields downward-biased PD estimates. Unbiased PD estimators, which account for different missingness mechanisms, are proposed. ...|$|E
