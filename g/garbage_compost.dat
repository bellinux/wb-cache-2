40|$|In soybean cultivation, {{fertilizer}} application is in a dilemma between more nitrogen supply suppresses the nitrogen fixation of root nodules, and nitrogen deficiency {{at the early}} stage causes the shortage of vegetable growth. Compost fertilizer is considered that release the nitrogen gradually in a long period. The objective of this experiment {{was to determine the}} effect of thermophile <b>garbage</b> <b>compost</b> on the growth and the seed yield of soybean and the nutrient leaching losses from the soil by the comparison with chemical fertilizer. Thermophile <b>garbage</b> <b>compost</b> was applied in the pots and the field before sowing of soybean. The amounts of compost application were adjusted as it contained the same (1 -T), 2 -times(2 -T), and 10 times (10 -T) of total nitrogen compared with that of chemical fertilizer. The NO 3 -N and potassium learched from the soil were significantly lower in 1 -T and 2 -T, and about same even in 10 -T, compared with that of chemical fertilizer applied soil. However, the compost aplication had no effect on the learching of phosphorus and the total EC. Soybesn plant growth was not affected by the compost application until the flowering stage. However, the pod number, seed number and seed weight increased in 1 -T and 10 -T at harvest time. This effect is suggested that compost fertilizer could supply the nitrogen to the plants especially at the late growth stage. From the above results, it is considered that thermophile <b>garbage</b> <b>compost</b> is not only effective for preventing the nutrient learching but also suitable as a fertilizer in soybean cultivation...|$|E

40|$|Description: Orange Hawkweed is a {{perennial}} plant with matted, hairy leaves and showy flower heads. The flowers are bright orange-red, {{about an inch}} in diameter, born in tight clusters of 5 to 35 flowers {{at the top of}} wiry stalks from June to August. The flower stalks grow from a few inches to 2 feet in height, are nearly leafless, occasionally with 1 or 2 small clasping leaves, and are covered with distinctive, stiff black hairs. Plants spread by seeds, rhizomes (underground stems) or numerous hairy, leafy stolons (above ground runners). Impacts: Orange Hawkweed reproduces and spreads through prolific seed production as well as vegetatively through stolons and rhizomes. Under ideal conditions, one plant can spread and infest an area 2 - 3 feet in diameter in its first year of growth. It forms extensive mats, displacing native species and lowering biodiversity. It is an aggressive competitor for space, light and soil nutrients. Hawkweeds are able to produce seed either with or without pollination, and their own pollen is allelopathic, which can cause other plants to be infertile, giving them an even greater advantage. Control Options: Thurston County’s Integrated Pest Management emphasizes cultural, biological, and manual control methods to keep pests and vegetation problems low enough to prevent damage. The goal of Thurston County’s pesticide use policy is to minimize the use of pesticides by utilizing and providing information about the most effective control options that are available and practical. ► Manual / Mechanical For isolated plants or small patches, manual removal can help control hawkweeds, especially if used to prevent seed production by removing plants that are budded or in bloom. Use care when digging around rosettes; pieces of root crowns and stolons will form new plants very quickly if left in contact with the soil. Be very careful to double bag removed plants and deposit in <b>garbage,</b> not <b>compost.</b> ► Biological There are currently no known biocontrol agents for use on hawkweeds in the United States. Since there are many native, non-invasive hawkweed species as well, it seems unlikely that insects or pathogens will be discovered that would be effective on noxious strains without causing damage to native varieties...|$|R

A worm bin is a self contained system. As with any system, several components are involved. This system is composed of a box to contain the worms (a description of how to build a worm bin follows on the next page); the worms themselves; a controlled environment; and regular maintenance procedures. Red worms are the most satisfactory worms to use in a home vermicomposting (composting with worms) system. The species of red worm best suited for a worm bin is Eisenia foetida pronounced “I see nee a fet id a. ” Eisenia Foetida is known by several common names: red worm, brandling worm, red wiggler, manure worm and fish worm among others. Starter worms of this species for a worm bin may be found in old compost piles (ones that no longer generate any heat) or from local bait suppliers. Once the worm bin is constructed, make bedding for the worms with shredded and moistened newspaper or cardboard. Maintain the system by burying food wastes throughout the bin on a rotational basis. Every three to six months, move the compost {{to one side of the}} bin and add new bedding to the empty half. The worms will soon move to the new bedding.

To make base, cut the 14 foot 2 " x 4 " into five pieces: two 48 " and three 20 " long. The remaining 12 " piece will be used in making the sides. Nail the 2 " x 4 "s together on edge with two 16 d nails at each joint as illustrated in the diagram. Nail the plywood piece onto the 2 "x 4 " frame using the 4 d nails. To build the box, cut three 12 " pieces from the 16 foot 2 " x 4 ". Place a 12 inch 2 " x 4 " under the end of each side panel so that the 2 " x 4 " is flush with the top and side edges of the plywood...|$|R
40|$|Hong Kong {{is facing}} a tough waste {{management}} problem due to the increasing waste load and lack of landfill spaces and other waste treatment methods. On the other hand, waste minimization measures are yet {{to be effective in}} reducing waste load. Universities in Hong Kong are also generating a lot of waste which has become a big challenge to sustainable development in their campuses. The higher education sector in Hong Kong has the obligations for diverting their waste from landfill and play role models for the public. Good waste management strategies are required. However, there is little published information on the waste characteristics on universities in Hong Kong {{as well as in the}} world. This study was set out to investigate the waste characteristics of the residential student population of The University of Hong Kong (HKU). This study was conducted in a residential college in HKU with slightly more than 400 student residents. Waste audits were conducted on all 20 floors to gather basic information on the quantity and characteristics of the waste stream of the residential college. At present, there are two <b>garbage</b> bins, one <b>composting</b> box and at least one recycling bin on each floor. Specially, on the 4 thfloor podium, there is a four-bin system and a Bokashi composting system for storing and composting the recycled materials and food waste from each floor, respectively. The waste audit results show that the mean waste generation in the residential college was 0. 11 kg per student per day, which was much lower than the mean daily waste generation of Hong Kong people of 0. 89 kg per person per day (in 2014). However, this may not be the total waste generated by the students per day as they spent most of the day time outside the residential college. Meanwhile, like the municipal solid waste characteristic in Hong Kong, food waste had the largest proportion (37. 1 % by weight) followed by papers (4. 1 %), plastic packaged food containers and packaging materials from supermarkets (3. 9 %) and glass bottles (3. 1 %). Currently, only 9. 6 % of the total waste was recycled in the residential college and 73 % of the wastes dumped are recyclables that are not recycled. These clearly show that waste recycling was done poorly despite the availability of sufficient recycling facilities in the residential college. Recommendations on improving the current waste management in this residential college were put forward according to the waste audit results. Firstly, recycling facilities and service provision should be improved. Behavior change methods including educational seminar, workshop and display together with green purchasing policies should be provided. Campaigns or competition on waste minimization may also be run in the residential college. Moreover, measures for recycling tetra packs, reducing food waste and take-away containers, and green purchasing in supermarkets should be takento further release the landfill pressure and to achieve sustainable development. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R
