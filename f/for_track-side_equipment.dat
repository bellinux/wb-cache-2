40|$|A current {{standardization}} effort <b>for</b> <b>track-side</b> <b>equipment</b> in German railways {{faces the}} difficulty of having to proceed incrementally. This means that {{only some of the}} interfaces of complex entities like interlocking controllers are specified while others remain {{under the control of the}} diverse manufacturers. As these other interfaces are necessary for testing the specified ones for standard conformance, a specific approach has to be devised to be able to achieve this goal. This paper presents the problem in its practical setting and the way it is intended to be solved...|$|E
40|$|OVERVIEW: Providing {{safe and}} secure {{transport}} is the most basic principle of railroads, and this is made possible by train control systems. Drawing on its expertise in information control technologies, Hitachi has made enormous strides in addressing user needs by developing digital ATC (automatic train control) systems for application to congested rail lines, reducing train headways, improving passenger comfort with one-step brake control, {{reducing the amount of}} track-side equipment, and many other initiatives. However, these innovations are not just confined to congested routes, for every line can benefit from improved safety and lower costs <b>for</b> <b>track-side</b> <b>equipment</b> and maintenance. To meet these needs, it is essential to achieve closer cooperation between track-side and on-board systems than in the past, and to develop train control systems with the flexibility to run autonomously. Leveraging its expertise and technological edge, Hitachi is moving boldly to develop new systems and a wide range of solutions calculated to enhance rail services in the near-term future...|$|E

5000|$|At 8 June 2009, Ropes Creek station {{platform}} {{has been}} heavily excavated and shortened to approximately 50 m, {{with only the}} area containing the overhead footbridge and platform buildings remaining and fenced off from public access. This has been designated a heritage area. Within this fenced off area, signals (both semaphore and colour light) along with other various pieces of <b>track-side</b> <b>equipment</b> was dumped in piles with no regard to their heritage importance. A large sign on the fence indicated that the station {{would be part of}} a proposed [...] "Cultural Park".|$|R
50|$|In Israel ETCS Level 2 {{will begin}} {{replacing}} PZB in 2018. Three separate tenders are being issued in 2016 {{for this purpose}} (one contract each will be awarded <b>for</b> <b>track-side</b> infrastructure, rolling-stock integration, and the erection of a GSM-R network).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} to formalize {{different}} kinds of tests for a railway system. The common theme of the test scenarios {{is the goal of}} performing them in a reference laboratory. One line of tests concern the ETCS system, starting with specification conformity of the on-board unit. These tests are extended to address interoperability of different components of the ETCS system, and then to the validation of operational serviceability. The other line of tests aims to establish the interoperability of <b>track-side</b> <b>equipment.</b> The formalization concept for the ETCS tests starts with the conformity tests of the on-board unit, which itself is fully specified. Interoperability and serviceability address the unit's interaction with other equipment. This involves coping with systems in the test which are only partially defined. This is a feature of even more importance in the treatment of track-side interoperability. Overall, it is shown how a variety of different techniques is needed to cope with the challenge of fully attaining meaningful test results...|$|R
40|$|Transport {{communications}} systems face challenges {{relating to the}} number, density and velocity of passengers. In the rail environment, it would be advantageous {{to be able to}} provide broadband-like data connectivity to all passengers. Due to the limited number of connection points into trackside fibre-optic cables (ca. one per 5 km), and the limited spacing possible between trackside-to-train links (ca. 100 m due to fog), novel solutions <b>for</b> <b>track-side</b> communications backbones are needed. We estimate the total capacity as being in the order of 40 Gbit/s, which requires the investigation of novel means of providing spectral efficiency. Spatial modes offer significant benefits, but also bring challenges such as requiring large antenna apertures, which may be tackled by using partial aperture antenna approaches or by employing lenses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- This paper summarises {{results of}} several {{experimental}} investigations on draught air flows induced by rail vehicles (slipstream effect). In addition to full-scale track-side measurements, model-scale experiments {{have been carried}} out in a conventional wind tunnel. The overall aim of the model tests is to capture the physics of the flow field induced by a train and to identify the relevant parameters which determine the slipstream behaviour of a vehicle. Experimental results are reported <b>for</b> <b>track-side</b> tests using according to the upcoming European homologation standard TSI HS RST [1] {{to ensure the safety of}} passengers waiting on a platform. Furthermore, the influence of tail shape details of a regional train on slipstream velocities induced in its wake has been investigated in a wind tunnel employing a scale 1 : 20 train model. Flow velocities were measured using a hot-wire probe that was traversed within the wake region. Both oil paint and smoke visualisations were used to investigate the structure of the flow field in the wake. The results show, that different types of wake pattern can be distinguished. A comparison of the methods is given...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFine {{particulate}} matter samples (PM 2. 5) {{were collected from}} three locations around the Denver–Metropolitan area to study the impacts of the ground–level light rail on airborne metal concentrations. Size–segregated PM was collected on board the trains, {{at the side of}} the tracks, and at a background location in downtown Denver. Results from this study showed highest crustal enrichment factors of metals in samples collected on board the train, despite lower concentrations of total PM 2. 5. Metals commonly found in steel such as Fe, Cr, Mn, and Ni, all exhibited elevated concentrations relating to train activity over the background site. Iron in the PM 2. 5 at track–side and on board the trains was above the background by a factor of 1. 89 and 1. 54, respectively. For Mn, the ratios were 1. 34 <b>for</b> the <b>track–side</b> and 0. 94 for the on board samples. Cr and Ni exhibited higher ratios over the background only in samples collected on board the trains at 1. 59 (Cr) and 1. 26 (Ni). Soluble metals were measured with Ni (53 – 71 %), Cu (52 – 81 %), and Zn (30 – 81 %) exhibiting the highest solubilities across the different sites. Soluble Fe ranged from 8 – 15 % for the total measured Fe, indicating a non–crustal source of Fe. Soluble Fe was also characterized as Fe(II) and Fe(III) with 87 – 90 % of the soluble Fe being Fe(II), similar to results from studies in Los Angeles, CA and East St. Louis, IL but higher than in Atlanta, GA and Waukesha, WI...|$|R
