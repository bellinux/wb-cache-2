500|$|The {{choice of}} [...] gun and {{the mix of}} quadruple and twin turrets for the main battery of the King George Vs had been {{dictated}} by the Second London Naval Treaty, which limited battleships to [...] standard displacement and a main calibre of 14inches. The treaty was meant to prevent a costly naval arms race that Britain could ill afford. However, when the Japanese Government refused to agree to its terms, the maximum calibre allowed reverted to 16inches in April 1937. The Board of Admiralty then began preliminary design work on a 35,000-ton ship armed with 16-inch guns and they were promising enough that the Director of Naval Construction (DNC) was ordered to further investigate such designs, providing for several aircraft as well. To save <b>design</b> <b>time,</b> many {{of the features of}} the King George Vs were incorporated in the new design, but the limited size of the ship was a real challenge for the designers. In order to maintain the same speed, protection, and secondary armament as the preceding King George Vs while using 16 inch guns, the design displacement rose to 41,000-tons, mainly due to the increased weight of the main armament. Hoping to remain within treaty limits, the increased weight of the main armament was compensated for by a slight reduction in the overall weight of armour and the elimination of two twin [...] gun turrets.|$|E

2500|$|A woofer is {{a driver}} that reproduces low frequencies.

Indeed, both are so closely connected that they must be considered together in use. [...] Only at <b>design</b> <b>time</b> do the separate properties of enclosure and woofer matter individually. Some loudspeaker systems use a woofer for the lowest frequencies, sometimes well enough that a subwoofer is not needed. Additionally, some loudspeakers use the woofer to handle middle frequencies, eliminating the mid-range driver. This can be accomplished with the selection of a tweeter that can work low enough that, combined with a woofer that responds high enough, the two drivers add coherently in the middle frequencies.|$|E
