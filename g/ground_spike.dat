50|$|Because {{there was}} a {{shortage}} of pumps - they were badly needed for fighting fires started by bombing - a simpler type of mobile flame trap was also designed. This consisted {{of a number of}} 12 in diameter pipes welded shut to make a 12 ft long cylindrical drum which was filled with 43 imp gal of gasoline-oil mixture and pressurised with an inert gas. A number of these cylinders could be transported {{on the back of a}} vehicle and, at a weight of just under 1000 lb, could be deployed reasonably quickly wherever an ambush was required. The cylinders would be placed at intervals along a road each with a short length of hose leading to a nozzle secured by <b>ground</b> <b>spikes.</b> Flow was initiated by a pull-string that opened a valve and ignition was provided by Molotov cocktails.|$|R

40|$|Contemporary {{modeling}} {{approaches to}} the dynamics of neural networks consider two main classes of models: biologically <b>grounded</b> <b>spiking</b> neurons and functionally inspired rate-based units. The unified simulation framework presented here supports {{the combination of the}} two for multi-scale modeling approaches, the quantitative validation of mean-field approaches by spiking network simulations, and an increase in reliability by usage of the same simulation code and the same network model specifications for both model classes. While most efficient spiking simulations rely on the communication of discrete events, rate models require time-continuous interactions between neurons. Exploiting the conceptual similarity to the inclusion of gap junctions in spiking network simulations, we arrive at a reference implementation of instantaneous and delayed interactions between rate-based models in a spiking network simulator. The separation of rate dynamics from the general connection and communication infrastructure ensures flexibility of the framework. We further demonstrate the broad applicability of the framework by considering various examples from the literature ranging from random networks to neural field models. The study provides the prerequisite for interactions between rate-based and spiking models in a joint simulation...|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} use of unbalanced {{transmission lines}} was for electric telegraph communications. These consisted of single wires strung between poles. The return path {{for the current}} was originally provided by a separate conductor. Some early telegraph systems, such as Schilling's experimental needle telegraph (1832) and the Cooke & Wheatstone five-needle telegraph (1837) used by British railways required multiple code wires. Essentially, they were parallel bus coding. In these systems {{the cost of the}} return conductor was not so significant (one conductor in seven for Schilling's earliest needle telegraph and one conductor in six for the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph) but the number of coding conductors was progressively reduced with improved systems. Soon only one coding wire was required with the data being transmitted serially. Important examples of these single-wire systems were the Morse telegraph (1837) and the Cooke & Wheatstone single-needle telegraph (1843). In such systems the cost of a return conductor was fully 50 per cent of the cable costs. It was discovered that a return conductor could be replaced with a return path through the Earth using <b>grounding</b> <b>spikes.</b> Using earth return was a significant cost saving and rapidly became the norm.|$|R

40|$|Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), {{encompassing}} E. coli O 157 and non-O 157 STEC, is {{a significant}} cause of food-borne illnesses and deaths in the United States and worldwide. Shiga toxins (encoded by stx) and intimin (encoded by eae) are important virulence factors for STEC strains linked to severe human illnesses such as hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. In this study, the stx 1, stx 2, and eae genes were chosen as targets to design loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays for the rapid, specific, sensitive, and quantitative detection of STEC strains. The assay performances in pure culture and <b>spiked</b> <b>ground</b> beef and human stools were evaluated and {{compared with those of}} quantitative PCR (qPCR). No false-positive or false-negative results were observed among 90 bacterial strains used to evaluate assay specificity. The limits of detection for seven STEC strains of various serogroups (O 26, O 45, O 103, O 111, O 121, O 145, and O 157) were approximately 1 to 20 CFU/reaction in pure culture and 103 to 104 CFU/g in <b>spiked</b> <b>ground</b> beef, which were comparable to the results of qPCR. Standard curves generated suggested good linear relationships between STEC cell numbers and LAMP turbidity signals. When applied in <b>ground</b> beef samples <b>spiked</b> with two low levels (1 to 2 and 10 to 20 CFU/ 25 g) of STEC cultures, the LAMP assays achieved accurate detection after 6 to 8 h enrichment. The assays also consistently detected STEC in human stool specimens spiked with 103 or 104 CFU/ 0. 5 g stool after 4 h enrichment, while qPCR required 4 to 6 h. In conclusion, the LAMP assays developed in this study may facilitate rapid and reliable identification of STEC contaminations in high-risk food commodities and also facilitate prompt diagnosis of STEC infections in clinical laboratories...|$|R

40|$|Combined {{measurements}} of soil temperature and electric {{potential in the}} upper 15 cm of a glacial sandy-loam soil were made during the winters of 1986 - 1987 and 19871988 at the University of Michigan Botanical Gardens using an electronic data acquisition system at frequencies varying from 10 min to daily (midnight). Most of {{the data was collected}} at hourly intervals. Analysis of temperature-potential time series at two locations with probes at (0, 3, 6, 9) and (0, 5, 10, 15) cm depths indicated that the variation of electric potential relative to the potential of a 1. 5 m <b>ground</b> <b>spike</b> could be interpreted as the response of an electrolytic concentration cell without transference formed by a probe and the <b>ground</b> <b>spike.</b> As the electrolyte concentration is much greater at the <b>ground</b> <b>spike,</b> and electric potential varies inversely with concentration, the potentials at the soil probes varied over the range of approximately 300 - 700 mV {{in a manner consistent with}} the behavior of a concentration cell. The rapid and systematic pattern of potential variation during freeze-thaw events demonstrates that the effects of electrolyte concentration and dilution are products of evaporation-distillation, the melting of frost-purified ice, soil water advection to the freezing-evaporating region, concentrated electrolyte expulsion from the freezing region and the infiltration of rain and snow melt waters...|$|E

40|$|The {{nature of}} the code used in the {{auditory}} cortex to represent complex auditory stimuli, such as naturally spoken words, remains a matter of debate. Here we argue that such representations are encoded by stable spatio-temporal patterns of firing within cell assemblies known as polychronous groups, or PGs. We develop a physiologically <b>grounded,</b> unsupervised <b>spiking</b> neural network model of the auditory brain with local, biologically realistic, spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP) learning, and show that the plastic cortical layers of the network develop PGs which convey substantially {{more information about the}} speaker independent identity of two naturally spoken word stimuli than does rate encoding that ignores the precise spike timings. We furthermore demonstrate that such informative PGs can only develop if the input spatio-temporal spike patterns to the plastic cortical areas of the model are relatively stable...|$|R
50|$|The Type 84 is a Chinese air-dispersed scatterable {{anti-tank}} mine, normally deployed by the GBL212 122 mm artillery rocket, or the Type 122-15 ATML rocket {{for export}} versions. Each rocket can carry {{six or eight}} mines and has a range of around six or seven kilometres. The rockets are launched from a BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launcher system that can hold up to 24 of the rockets. A time fuse on the rocket is set before launch, which activates at a predetermined distance after firing. Upon activation, the rocket head bursts, ejecting the mines, which descend with small green parachutes that slow their fall. The mine consists of a cylindrical body with three prong legs that form a spike, which pierces the ground and arms. If the mine strikes soft <b>ground,</b> the <b>spike</b> is driven {{into the ground and}} the mine is held upright.|$|R
