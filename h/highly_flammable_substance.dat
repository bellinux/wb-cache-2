50|$|However, {{the process}} has not been studied well because it is archaic. Most importantly, {{it has never been}} modernized by {{manufacturing}} companies. In addition, the conventional process can be environmentally unfriendly because ethanol is a <b>highly</b> <b>flammable</b> <b>substance.</b> It is unsanitary because of the open vessels and tanks; thus, the possibility of contamination is high. The cold ethanol format may be too gentle to kill off certain viruses that require heat inactivation. Since this process remains unchanged for so long, several built-in inefficiencies and inconsistencies affect the economics of the process for pharmaceutical and manufacturing companies.|$|E
50|$|Eddy, {{a detective}} {{who works as}} a {{security}} guard in a department store, is engaged to Barbara, a clerk in the same store. After receiving some perfume as a gift from a mysterious admirer, Barbara is burnt to death when she walks under some warm halogen spotlights. In order to discover what killed Barbara, Eddy decides to investigate together with Inspector Turroni. Afterwards, a prostitute named Portia is murdered in a similar way and Eddy discovers the cause of their deaths... the perfume sent to each victim by the killer contains a <b>highly</b> <b>flammable</b> <b>substance</b> (benzopyrene-15). Eddy decides to find if there was a connection between the two victims and he discovers that each victim had in her possession of a piece of a picture. The picture was taken years before, in 1971, when the victims were just young girls. They had spent that summer together with a girl named Mariri, and another mysterious girl, at a holiday camp managed by Sister Melania. THe criminal is apparently getting revenge for a terrible accident that happened that summer at the camp.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe use of {{biodiesel}} fuel {{in compression}} ignition engines {{has the potential to}} reduce CO 2, which can lead to a reduction in global warming and environmental hazards. Biodiesel is an attractive fuel, as it is made from renewable resources. A major drawback {{associated with the use of}} biodiesel, however, is its poor cold flow properties, which have a direct influence on the cold starting performance of the engine. This paper is a consequence of a study on assessing the cold-starting performance of a compression ignition engine fueled with different blends of fossil diesel fuel and biodiesel. Through experimental investigations, it was found that the engine starting at - 20 °C was no longer possible in the case of using B 50 (50 % diesel + 50 % biofuel made from sunflower oil). In order to “force” the engine starting in this particular situation, Di-Ethyl-Ether (DEE) was injected into the intake manifold. DEE being a <b>highly</b> <b>flammable</b> <b>substance,</b> the result was a sudden and explosive engine starting, the peak pressure in the monitored cylinder in the first successful engine cycle being almost twice the one which is usually considered as normal. Thus, to explain the observed phenomena, we launched this work relying on the analysis of the in-cylinder instantaneous pressure evolution, which was acquired during cranking, stabilizing and idling phases. Moreover, since the cause of the sudden and explosive engine starting was the DEE, by using a CFD approach, we also obtained results regarding the inter-cylinder distribution of the injected DEE...|$|E

50|$|Flammability is {{the ability}} of a {{substance}} to burn or ignite, causing fire or combustion. The degree of difficulty required to cause the combustion of a substance is quantified through fire testing. Internationally, a variety of test protocols exist to quantify flammability. The ratings achieved are used in building codes, insurance requirements, fire codes and other regulations governing the use of building materials as well as the storage and handling of <b>highly</b> <b>flammable</b> <b>substances</b> inside and outside of structures and in surface and air transportation. For instance, changing an occupancy by altering the flammability of the contents requires the owner of a building to apply for a building permit {{to make sure that the}} overall fire protection design basis of the facility can take the change into account.|$|R

50|$|The least {{stable and}} most {{reactive}} form of phosphorus {{is the white}} allotrope. It is a hazardous, <b>highly</b> <b>flammable</b> and toxic <b>substance,</b> spontaneously igniting in air and producing phosphoric acid residue. It is therefore normally stored under water. White phosphorus {{is also the most}} common, industrially important, and easily reproducible allotrope, and for these reasons is regarded as the standard state of phosphorus. The most stable form is the black allotrope, which is a metallic looking, brittle and relatively non-reactive semiconductor (unlike the white allotrope, which has a white or yellowish appearance, is pliable, highly reactive and a semiconductor). When assessing periodicity in the physical properties of the elements it needs to be borne in mind that the quoted properties of phosphorus tend to be those of its least stable form rather than, {{as is the case with}} all other elements, the most stable form.|$|R
50|$|A BLEVE {{need not}} be a {{chemical}} explosion—nor does there need to be a fire—however if a <b>flammable</b> <b>substance</b> is subject to a BLEVE it may also be subject to intense heating, either from an external source of heat which may have caused the vessel to rupture in the first place or from an internal source of localized heating such as skin friction.
