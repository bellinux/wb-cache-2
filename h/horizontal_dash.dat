Messapian pottery was made by the Messapii an ancient people inhabiting the heel of Italy since around 1000 BC who migrated from Crete or Illyria. Messapian pottery consisted first primarily, with geometric patterns like circles, squares, diamonds, <b>horizontal</b> <b>dash</b> patterns, swastika and other similar motifs. Late through Greek influence the meander was added. From about the beginning of the 5th century BC again under Greek influence, with imports of Attic pottery, figurative decoration was added. In addition, leaf motifs, new elements such as ivy and other repertoire were included. Up to then only fragments of the pottery was decorated in contrast to the whole surface being decorated after the 5th century BC. In the fourth century BC, the artists came back again to geometric ornamentation, but by then the ceramics were almost completely under Greek influence.|$|E

The ideal strategy developed in Section. 3.2 is defined by the Nash equilibrium of the game [4]. The detailed information about ACOCOA will be explained in the following.|$|E

Specification of the model The examined system is a single segment with a revolute joint controlled by a single lumped muscle (Supplemental Figure 1). The single joint- which is made to emulate the elbow joint in the related experiments- is simulated as a rigid segment with an inertia of I = 0. 07 kilograms·metres 2, {{similar to that of}} the human forearm and hand taken together [8]. The dynamics for the single joint are thus given by the equation: θ ̈ = τ(t) I (1) where, θ̈, is the angular acceleration of the joint and, τ(t), is the total torque applied at the joint at time, t. The total torque, τ(t), is net of the three 1 Figure 1 : A schematic of the system used for the simulations described in this document.
