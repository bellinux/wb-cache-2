5|$|Early {{on in the}} force's history, most of its {{equipment}} and weapons had to be imported from abroad, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> indigenous Canadian industry. Its early saddlery and wagons were imported from the United States, although the police's uniforms were made locally. After 1887, political pressure grew to use Canadian suppliers whenever possible. Supplies of food and similar goods were initially bought from the major trading companies in the west, such as the Hudson's Bay Company, but this gradually changed once more of the territories were settled and goods could be purchased from smaller, local firms, with the police becoming {{an important source of}} business. Equipment and supplies had to be bought from companies that supported the government of the day, and after 1896 a formal list of politically approved suppliers was kept by the comptroller's office. All of the police's guns had to be imported, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> indigenous manufacturers, and by 1890s the force was still buying most of its ammunition from abroad, as Canadian-manufactured cartridges remained substandard.|$|E
