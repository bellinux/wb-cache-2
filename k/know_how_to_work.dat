That bloke knows livestock, knows how to work them, can cut a {{straight}} line with a saw, handle concrete, build a set of yards, fix a motor car—you name it. When you're a hundred miles from town, you can't afford to get a tradesman out for every little job that bobs up. So you've got to slip in and do it yourself... One of the bosses from a cattle station told me [...] "Sam, if a bloke comes in here in a big hat and ringer boots, he's got a job. They can turn their hands to anything. They <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and they don't gutsache all the time." ...|$|E

60|$|Then {{came the}} underfeeding. Hal awoke {{one day to}} the fact that his dog-food was half gone and the {{distance}} only quarter covered; further, that for love or money no additional dog-food was to be obtained. So he cut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the day's travel. His sister and brother-in-law seconded him; but they were frustrated by their heavy outfit and their own incompetence. It was a simple matter to give the dogs less food; but it was impossible to make the dogs travel faster, while their own inability to get under way earlier in the morning prevented them from travelling longer hours. Not only did they not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> dogs, but they did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> themselves.|$|E

50|$|Student {{versions}} {{that were}} offered for very low prices were limited; {{they could not}} produce photo plot files. They {{also contributed to the}} popularity of the software as most students <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with the program.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're a grim lot. Work or starve is a stern choice, {{particularly}} {{if one has}} never done either. It looks as if you hadn't much use for purely ornamental people. But what about the half-taught women who don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work?</b> What {{do you do with}} them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Huck Finn, do {{you want}} me to let her SEE how bad I want to go? Why, she'd begin to doubt, right away, and imagine a lot of sicknesses and dangers and objections, and first you know she'd take it all back. You lemme alone; I reckon I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{takes all}} sorts of people to make a world; workers and {{students}} both are needed, and there is room for all. But I think the workers should study some, and the students should <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> if necessary," [...] answered Mrs. Jo, looking from Dan to Demi with a significant expression.|$|E

50|$|Some {{problems}} immediately recognized {{were that}} ground stations {{tended to be}} {{too far from the}} targets, the ground and aircraft equipment was not maintained properly, few technicians <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> the equipment, and operators were too unfamiliar with Korean geography to use the system to the fullest extent.|$|R
6000|$|... “Oh, I don’t know. Probably nowhere. But {{if such a}} {{man could}} be found I am certain he would turn out a very stupid person. You can’t be {{expected}} to furnish every one who approaches you with a mind. To expect {{that would be too}} much, even from you who <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> wonders at such little cost to yourself.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said I to myself, [...] "perhaps her pump {{is out of}} order, {{or it may be}} {{that she}} does not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> it. It is getting late. She may have to go a long distance. I could pump it up for her in no time. Even if there is a hole in it I could mend it." [...] But I did not stop. I had steeled my heart against any more adventures in Cathay.|$|E
6000|$|... "With an {{old woman}} who used to look after our cottage," [...] she answered. [...] "But she is very poor, and she cannot keep me any longer. Mrs. Colson says that I must go and work, and I am afraid. I don't know anyone except at Tredowen! And I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work!</b> And I don't want to go away from the pictures, and the garden, and the sea! It is all so beautiful, isn't it? Don't you love Tredowen?" ...|$|E
50|$|As the {{newcomers}} <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with copper they soon {{moved to the}} so-called copperbelt of the island, that is {{the foothills of the}} Troodos mountains. This movement reflects the increased interest in the raw material {{that was going to be}} so closely connected with Cyprus for several centuries afterwards.|$|R
2500|$|Don was {{a terrific}} {{television}} personality. But when you saw Don doing his floor show, whether in clubs or theatres, {{when he had a}} live audience and band he really owned that stage. Don Lane <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> a room and gave us Las Vegas [...] "pizazz" [...] whenever he performed.|$|R
50|$|Sikyatata {{became the}} first Hopi {{silversmith}} in 1898. Hopi Indian silversmiths today {{are known for their}} overlay technique used in silver jewelry designs. The scarcity of silver kept the primary jewelry components used by the Hopi to shell and stone until the 1930s and 1940s, and very few Hopi <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> silver.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Lapham {{reported}} {{to her husband}} {{when he came home}} at night--he had left his business to go and meet her, and then, after a desolate dinner at the house, had returned to the office again--that Penelope was fully as bad as Irene. [...] "And she don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> it off. Irene keeps doing; but Pen just sits in her room and mopes. She don't even read. I went up this afternoon to scold her about the state the house was in--you can see that Irene's away by the perfect mess; but when I saw her through the crack of the door I hadn't the heart. She sat there with her hands in her lap, just staring. And, my goodness! she JUMPED so when she saw me; and then she fell back, and began to laugh, and said she, 'I thought it was my ghost, mother!' I felt as if I should give way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't any plans," [...] replied Dick; and, {{taking the}} moment as propitious, {{he decided to}} speak frankly {{concerning}} himself. [...] "I just drifted down here. My home is in Chicago. When I left school some years ago--I'm twenty-five now--I {{went to work for}} my father. He's--he has business interests there. I tried all kinds of inside jobs. I couldn't please my father. I guess I put no real heart in my work. The fact was I didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> The governor and I didn't exactly quarrel; but he hurt my feelings, and I quit. Six months or more ago I came West, and have knocked about from Wyoming southwest to the border. I tried to find congenial work, but nothing came my way. To tell you frankly, Mr. Belding, I suppose I didn't much care. I believe, though, that all the time I didn't know what I wanted. I've learned--well, just lately--" ...|$|E
60|$|No longer {{was there}} {{impatient}} inaction {{on board the}} Majestic, for {{not only did the}} Heureux reply vigorously, but the Tonnant--the eighth of the enemy's line--opened fire on their other side. The Majestic therefore fought on both sides. Throughout the whole ship the stalwart, half-naked men heaved at the huge guns. Everywhere, from stem to stern, was exhibited in full swing the active processes of sponging out, passing along powder and ball, ramming home the charges, running out, working the handspikes, stepping aside to avoid the recoil--and the whole operation of working the guns, as only British seamen <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> them! All this was done in the midst of smoke, flame, crashing shot, and flying splinters, while the decks were slippery with human blood, and strewn with dead men, from amongst whom the wounded were raised as tenderly as the desperate circumstances in which they were placed would admit of, and carried below. Many of those who were thus raised never reached the cockpit, but again fell, along with those who bore them.|$|E
5000|$|Ned Hanlon, {{who played}} with Baldwin in Detroit, later said of Baldwin: [...] "I will not {{hesitate}} in saying that 'Lady' Baldwin was the best left-handed pitcher of his day {{and one of the}} best that ever stood in the box. He had wonderful command, speed and curves, and <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> the batters." ...|$|R
5000|$|Unhappy {{with the}} way he felt Capitol was {{promoting}} their urban artists, in 2007 Chingy jumped ship and returned to DTP Records, which was by-then a part of the Def Jam family. When asked upon this move, the St. Louis rapper said: [...] "I don't think Capitol really <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> urban artists, They're really stuck on pop and they didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> market me." ...|$|R
60|$|Tilly, {{the oldest}} girl, a red-cheeked, black-eyed lass of fourteen, was {{grinding}} briskly at the mortar, for spices were costly, {{and not a}} grain must be wasted. Prue kept time with the chopper, and the twins sliced away at the apples till their little brown arms ached, for all <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> and did so now with a will.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not unlike {{this might}} be the feeling of many an elegant and {{accomplished}} woman, whose education has taught and practiced her in everything that woman ought to know, except those identical ones which fit her for the care of a home, for the comfort of a sick-room; and so I say again that, whatever a woman may be in the way of beauty and elegance, she must have the strength and skill of a practical worker, or she is nothing. She is not simply to be the beautiful,--she is to make the beautiful, and preserve it; and she who makes and she who keeps the beautiful must be able to work, and <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Whatever offices of life are performed by women of culture and refinement are thenceforth elevated; they cease to be mere servile toils, and become expressions of the ideas of superior beings. If a true lady makes even a plate of toast, in arranging a petit souper for her invalid friend, she does it as a lady should. She does not cut blundering and uneven slices; she does not burn the edges; she does not deluge it with bad butter, and serve it cold; but she arranges and serves all with an artistic care, with a nicety and delicacy, which make it worth one's while to have a lady friend in sickness.|$|E
60|$|I cast about innumerable {{ways for}} my future state of life, {{and began to}} {{consider}} very seriously what I should do, but nothing offered. I took care {{to make the world}} take me for something more than I was, and had it given out that I was a fortune, and that my estate was in my own hands; the last of which was very true, the first of it was as above. I had no acquaintance, which was one of my worst misfortunes, and the consequence of that was, I had no adviser, at least who could assist and advise together; and above all, I had nobody to whom I could in confidence commit the secret of my circumstances to, and could depend upon for their secrecy and fidelity; and I found by experience, that to be friendless is the worst condition, next to being in want that a woman can be reduced to: I say a woman, because 'tis evident men can be their own advisers, and their own directors, and <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> themselves out of difficulties and into business better than women; but if a woman has no friend to communicate her affairs to, and to advise and assist her, 'tis ten to one but she is undone; nay, and the more money she has, the more danger she is in of being wronged and deceived; and this was my case in the affair of the #100 which I left {{in the hands of the}} goldsmith, as above, whose credit, it seems, was upon the ebb before, but I, that had no knowledge of things and nobody to consult with, knew nothing of it, and so lost my money.|$|E

5000|$|The {{song was}} {{generally}} well received by critics. PopMatters {{said of the}} song, [...] "It’s formulaic, but at least this band <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> the formula well.".

50|$|One {{differential}} {{in astronomy}} tests {{is the great}} importance of knowing the skies and of carrying systematic observations, something {{as important as the}} formulation of hypotheses and theories.

50|$|The archaeological find of the Boscombe Bowmen {{has been}} cited {{in support of the}} human {{transport}} theory, while new glacier modelling supports the erratic theory.
