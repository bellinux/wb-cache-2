40|$|A new {{antibiotic}} {{was isolated}} from fermentations of Streptomyces erythreus designed for erythromycin A production. Isolation of this compound {{was accomplished by}} use of ion-exchange chromatography and countercurrent distribution. It crystallized from methyl isobutyl ketone in colorless acicular plates which melted at 127 to 130 C. The empirical formula was C 42 H 75 NO 14 with a molecular weight of 820. <b>Electrometric</b> <b>titration</b> in 66 % dimethylformamide showed an apparent pKa of 8. 4. Nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, and ultraviolet absorption indicated a close resemblance of the compound to known erythromycins, although its chromatographic behavior and solubility differed {{from those of the}} known erythromycins. Its antimicrobial spectrum was similar to erythromycin A, but the minimal inhibitory concentrations were much higher...|$|E
40|$|Parallel {{studies were}} made of cholinesterase {{activities}} and localizations in denervated rat and rabbit gastrocnemius muscle. Koelle's histochemical reaction was used for demonstrating the localization of cholinesterascs. Enzyme activities in whole sliced muscle were measured by <b>electrometric</b> <b>titration.</b> The Cartesian ampulla-diver technique was used for cholinesterase activity determinations in end plate regions or in small pieces of the muscle fibre itself. No changes in the activity of cholinesterases (ChE) {{were found in the}} whole denervated muscle which would account for its chemical supersensitivity. The ChE distribution pattern was changed so that the end plate region became less active in the denervated muscle than in the normal one. The decrease in ChE activity in the end plates seems to be largely compensated for by an increase of this enzyme elsewhere in the muscle. A possible connection between the spatial spread of cholinesterase activity and the enlargement of the acetylcholine-sensitive surface is discussed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn organic–inorganic nano-composite poly-o-anisidine Sn(IV) {{tungstate}} was chemically synthesized by sol–gel {{mixing of}} {{the incorporation of}} organic polymer o-anisidine into the matrices of inorganic ppt of Sn(IV) tungstate in different mixing volume ratios. This composite material has been characterized using various analytical techniques like XRD (X-ray diffraction), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared), SEM (Scanning electron microscopy), TEM (Transmission electron microscopy) and simultaneous TGA (Thermogravimetric analysis) studies. On the basis of distribution studies, the material {{was found to be}} highly selective for Hg(II). Using this nano-composite cation exchanger as electro-active material, a new heterogeneous precipitate based on ion-sensitive membrane electrode was developed for the determination of Hg(II) ions in solutions. The membrane electrode was mechanically stable, with a quick response time, and can be operated within a wide pH range.

40|$|Polypyrrole Sn(IV) phosphate, an organic–inorganic {{composite}} cation-exchanger was synthesized via sol-gel {{mixing of}} an organic polymer, polypyrrole, into the matrices of the inorganic precipitate of Sn(IV) phosphate. The physico-chemical {{properties of the}} material were determined using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS), CHN elemental analysis (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, ICP-MS), UV–VIS spectrophotometry, FTIR (Fourier Transform Infra-Red), SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy), TGA–DTA (Thermogravimetric Analysis–Differential Thermal Analysis), and XRD (X-ray diffraction). Ion-exchange behavior was observed to characterize the material. On the basis of distribution studies, the material {{was found to be}} highly selective for toxic heavy metal ion Mn 2 +. Due to its selective nature, the material was used as an electroactive component for the construction of an ion-selective membrane electrode. The proposed electrode shows fairly good discrimination of mercury ion over several other inorganic ions.

40|$|Crystalline gallium mycobactin P and chromic mycobactin P {{have been}} prepared. The chromic compound, unlike other {{metallic}} complexes of mycobactin P, does not detectably exchange its metal with ferric iron; it competitively antagonizes the growth-promoting action of mycobactin P towards Mycobacterium johnei. Mycobactin P, desferrioxamine B and desferrichrysin form coloured 1 : 1 complexes with ammonium vanadate. The vanadyl complexes of the water-soluble desferrisideramines are formed in aqueous solution. Two distinct forms occur at pH 7 and pH 3; these are slowly interconvertible when the pH is changed. The complexes show other changes at lower pH values; unlike other metallic desferrisideramine complexes, the vanadyl compounds do not dissociate {{even in the}} strongest acids, but dissociate above pH 9. Their properties have been studied spectrophotometrically, by electrophoresis and by <b>electrometric</b> <b>titration.</b> The affinity of mycobactin for ferric iron is {{greater than that of}} desferrioxamine B under two different conditions of measurement...|$|E
40|$|The protein {{coats of}} two densonucleosis viruses (types 1 and 2) were {{examined}} {{by a variety}} of biophysical, biochemical, and serological techniques. The viruses were 24 nm in diameter, contained at least four polypeptides, were remarkably stable to extremes of pH and denaturing agents, and were serologically closely related. The two viruses could, however, be distinguished serologically and by differences in migration of their structural polypeptides. For each virus the “top component” (i. e., the protein coat minus DNA, found occurring naturally in infections) appeared to have a composition identical to that of the coat of the virus and was a more stable structure. <b>Electrometric</b> <b>titration</b> curves of the virus particles and top components demonstrated that the DNA phosphate in densonucleosis virus particles was neutralized by cations other than basic amino acid side chains of the protein coat. Circular dichroism studies showed that there was a conformational difference between the protein coats of top components and virus particles...|$|E
40|$|Recovery and {{alteration}} of fish protein from wastes {{and its use}} has been regarded as a promising alternative to develop useful products once polymer gels have a high capacity of water uptake. This study aims to produce hydrogel, a super absorbent biopolymer from modified fish protein, in order to evaluate the protein structure. In the modified proteins, analyses {{of the extent of}} modification of the lysine residues, electrophoresis, and <b>electrometric</b> <b>titration</b> were performed. In the hydrogels were realized assays of swelling water. The proteins with more modifications were shown as 63. 5 % and 75. 9 % of lysine residues, from fish protein isolate obtained with alkaline and acid solubilization, respectively. The modified protein in that same rate presented 332. 0 and 311. 4 carboxyl groups.

Before this proposal sought to provide subsidies for the management and conservation management of this unit is to identify the points of pollution, analyze the water quality of the study site and to rank them according framing certified standards with the idealization of tools as support for management and administration. As for {{the idea that this}} conservation unit never came to pass, and there was discharge of sewage "in natura" in its waters, and favored increasing contamination by solid and liquid waste resulting from the urbanization of its surroundings. And still be considered one of the main tourist attractions and recreational services for the local population this issue deserved attention of municipal administrative staff, research institutes, environmental control and general population. So held health diagnosis and identified the points of pollution, analyzed the quality of its waters through methods like <b>electrometric,</b> the <b>titration.</b> It was evident that urbanization occurs when disorderly cause environmental degradation. For this fact the Long Pond Park suffers from solid waste disposal, both domestic and construction and pruning of trees beyond the influence of the open sewer. Data for pH, DO, water temperature were collected in situ by multiparameter probe Hanna NI 9828 and turbidity was obtained by turbidimeter Alkafit bench. Analysis of Nitrate, Nitrite, Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus were performed by the spectrophotometric method.

40|$|<b>Electrometric</b> and {{spectrophotometric}} <b>titrations</b> showed vancomycin {{to contain}} groups having pK values of about 2. 9, 7. 2, 8. 6, 9. 6, 10. 5 and 11. 7. Of these the four last-named were phenolic. Titration above pH 11 and below pH 1 was irreversible and antibiotic potency was destroyed. Combination {{with the specific}} peptide diacetyl-l-lysyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine hindered the titration {{of the first three}} phenolic groups. Spectrophotometric titration of iodovancomycin showed that the phenolic group with pK 9. 6 was the one iodinated. The stability of the vancomycin–peptide complex in the range pH 1 – 13 showed that complex-formation occurred only when carboxyl groups were ionized and the phenolic groups were non-ionized. The complex was formed in concentrations of urea up to 8 m, of potassium chloride up to 4 m, of sodium dodecyl sulphate up to 1 %, and at temperatures up to 60 °C. From titration curves, organic chlorine and iodine analysis, and combination with peptide, a minimum molecular weight for vancomycin of 1700 – 1800 was estimated. Optical-rotatory-dispersion and circular-dichroism experiments suggested that vancomycin has only limited conformational flexibility. Both vancomycin and its complexes with peptide exhibited properties suggesting aggregation. Vancomycin and iodovancomycin can be fractionated into a main fraction and at least three minor components. The isolation of these fractions salt-free is described and their antibiotic properties are shown to correlate with their ability to form complexes with peptide...|$|R
40|$|In 1888, de Rey Pailhade for {{the first}} time {{described}} a substance containing sulfur which {{he had been able to}} isolate from yeast in an impure state and he called this substance "Philothion". Hopkins in 1921, iso 1 ated from yeast cells a low molecular weight sulfur containing substance which he named "glutathione". Finding that the compound gave a positive nitroprusside reaction and contained glutamic acid and cysteine he concluded that it probably was a dipeptide of these amino acids. Eight years later Hunter and Eagles questioned the validity of the dipeptide structure and Hopkins was prompted to reinvestigate the constitution of the compound. With the aid of cuprous oxide as a reagent he was able to isolate glutathione as a copper derivative and from it to isolate glutathione itself in a crystalline form. On further analysis he found the substance to be a tripeptide consisting of glutamic acid, cysteine and glycine. Soon afterward Pirie and Pinhey performed {{for the first}} time the <b>electrometric</b> <b>titration</b> of the ionizable groups in glutathione and proposed the correct structure of the compound.

30|$|All the {{analysis}} was done according to standard protocol (APHA 2005). pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and {{total dissolved solids}} (TDS) were measured in the field by using pH and conductivity meter. To filter samples, 0.45  µm Millipore filter paper in vacuum filtration unit was used before {{the analysis}} of major cations and anions. The samples were then tested for major cations (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Na+ and K+), anions (HCO 3 −, CO 32 −, Cl−, SO 42 −, NO 3 − and F−), hardness and alkalinity. Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and hardness contents were measured by EDTA titrimetric method while Na+ and K+ contents were measured by Elico flame photometer. Cl− was calculated by AgNO 3 titration. HCO 3 − concentration and alkalinity were calculated by <b>electrometric</b> <b>titration</b> method. F− content was measured during Orion ion selective electrode 4 Star. NO 3 − and SO 42 − contents were examined using UV–visible spectrophotometer. The accurate measurements of major cations and anions were examined by calculating electrical neutrality (EN  %) (Appelo and Postma 1993). EN % values for all the samples were found within[*]±[*] 5 %. Basic statistical parameters, inter-ionic relation graphs, US salinity Laboratory (1954) diagram, Wilcox (1948) diagram and permeability index plot (1964) were prepared by using Microsoft Excel Version 2007.

40|$|Because {{of their}} {{importance}} in biochemistry {{and in the}} theory of amphoteric electrolytes, the acid and basic dissociation constants of amino acids and polypeptides have been measured by numerou~ investigators. A summary of available data has been published by Kirk and Schmidt (1). The agreement among the results of the several investigators is not very good. This is due to numerous causes, chief among them being the ever present uncertainty of the liquid junction potentials in the potentiometric studies, the difficulty of preparing compounds of sufficient purity and the neglect of certain corrections due to ionic activity. The first two named difficulties are mechanical in nature. A method of obviating the last was undertaken by Simms (2) in a series of titration experiments wherein he employed the BrSnsted and LaMer (3) limiting equation to obtain the activity coefficients of the ionic species involved. He worked with glycocoll and studied its dissociation in the presence of NaC 1 and BaC 12. The further <b>electrometric</b> <b>titration</b> of glycocoll and gelatin was conducted in the presence of certain antagonistic salt mixtures. The effect on the pH of the solution was complex. The present paper reports the potentiometric determination of the apparent acidic and basic dissociation constants of glycocoll and several peptides in aqueous solution. Measurements were also made in the presence of KC 1 or of K 2 SO ~ at equal ionic strength. Two methods, hydrolysis and titration, were employed. Hydrolysis afforded a basis of comparison of order of magnitude with the result...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} isomers and homologues of nicotine, (2 -, 3 - and 4 -pyridylmethyl) - and [2 -(2 -, 3 - and 4 -pyridyl) ethyl]- dialkylamines and trialkylammonium salts, have been prepared. They {{have been tested}} {{for their ability to}} act like {{acetylcholine}} in causing contracture of the chick biventer-cervicis and, some of them, for their ability to stimulate the superior cervical ganglion of the cat, causing contracture of the nictitating membrane. All the compounds have been tested for their ability to block transmission on the superior cervical ganglion of the cat and on the rat diaphragm preparation, and most of them for ability to inhibit the enzymatic hydrolysis of acetylcholine, using an acetone-powder of dog caudate nucleus as a source of acetylcholinesterase. The dissociation constants of the compounds have been measured by <b>electrometric</b> <b>titration.</b> The dissociation constants were used to compute the amount of monovalent ion present in the conditions of the biological tests, and the activities of the compounds have, accordingly, been compared on an ionic, as well as on a molecular, basis. The two sets of figures do not differ greatly. Trimethyl[2 -(3 -pyridyl) ethyl]ammonium (23) was the most potent compound on the chick and cat preparations. On an ionic basis (that is, compared with the monovalent nicotinium ion) this was 2. 6 times as active as nicotine on the chick biventer and 11 times as active on the cat superior cervical ganglion. On the rat diaphragm it was 7. 1 times as active as nicotine and less active than 1 -methyl- 1 -(3 -pyridylmethyl) -pyrrolidinium (26) (9. 5 times the nicotinium ion) and trimethyl(4 -pyridylmethyl) -ammonium (21) (11 times). The relationships between structure and dissociation constant, anticholinesterase activity, and activity in the pharmacological tests have been discussed...|$|E
40|$|By {{the use of}} two extreme models: a {{hydrated}} sphere and an unhydrated rod the valence (net charge) of corpuscular proteins can {{be successfully}} calculated from electric mobility data by the Debye-Hückel theory (modified to include {{the effect of the}} ions in the ion atmosphere) in conjunction with the electrophoretic theory of Henry. As pointed out by Abramson, this permits a comparison with values for the valence from titration data. <b>Electrometric</b> <b>titration</b> measurements of serum albumin B (Kekwick) have been determined at several ionic strengths. These results, together with the available data in the literature for serum albumin B, egg albumin, and β-lactoglobulin have been used to compare values for the valence calculated from measurements of titration, electrophoresis, and membrane potentials. The results indicate that the usual interpretation of titration curves is open to serious question. By extrapolation of the titration data to zero ionic strength and protein concentration, there results an "intrinsic" net charge curve describing the binding of H+ (OH-) ion alone. This curve agrees closely, in each case, with values of the valence calculated from mobility data (which in turn are in close accord with those estimated from membrane potential measurements). The experimental titration curves in the presence of appreciable quantities of ions and protein deviate widely from the ideal curve. It is suggested that, under these conditions, binding of undissociated acid (base) leads to erroneous values for the net charge. This binding would not affect the electrophoretic mobility. Values of the net charge obtained by the two extreme models from electrophoretic data are in agreement within 15 to 20 per cent. The agreement between the cylindrical model and the titration data is somewhat better in each case than with the sphere; i. e., this comparison enables a choice to be made between asymmetry and hydration in the interpretation of results from sedimentation and diffusion measurements on proteins. It is concluded that the proteins discussed here are somewhat asymmetric and also hydrated...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} of the biochemical properties of 1 -(epsilon- N-lysyl) - 1 -deoxy-D-fructose (fructose-lysine) a derivative which can probably arise from dried milk powder by the action of intestinal enzymes. This compound was synthesised chemically, purified by column chromatography and subjected to a number of analytical procedures including <b>electrometric</b> <b>titration,</b> chromatography and electrophoresis and 13 C- and proton-nuclear magnetic resonance, all of which confirmed the authenticity and purity of the preparation. The molecule was unstable in both acid and alkali and at room temperature. Simple fusions of sugars and lysine (HCl) were studied and methods devised for the preparation of 1 -(epsilon-N[U- 14 C]lysyl) - 1 -deoxy- D-fructose and 1 -(epsilon-N-lysyl) - 1 -deoxy-[U- 14 C] D-fructose. A sample of 1 -(epsilon- N-lysyl) - 1 -deoxy-D-lactulose (lactose-lysine), prepared by heating lactose with lysine HCl, was also obtained by a fusion procedure. This compound is also probably produced from dried milk powder in the alimentary tract. Growth curves of E. coli B have been studied in the presence and absence of fructose-lysine in the medium. The bacterium was found to be impermeable to fructose-lysine but this compound was able to support colonial growth after the induction of an extracellular cell-bound enzyme(s) capable of the breakdown of fructose-lysine. During growth significant amounts of 14 CO 2 were produced from fructose-lysine labelled with 14 C in the fructose moiety showing that combined hexose was utilisable as a carbon source. The products of the breakdown of radioactive fructose-lysine were examined by chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques. Lysine was identified in the culture media and this suggested that hydrolysis of the C-N bond linking the amino acid to the sugar occurred. A stable compound derived from labelled fructose-lysine and produced apparently without cleavage of the C-N bond was also detected but not fully characterised. The possible existence of other intermediates has been postulated. Rat liver slices, homogenates and mitochondrial preparations were shown to be capable of slowly metabolising fructose-lysine as judged by 14 CO 2 formation from fructose-lysines labelled in either the fructose or the lysine moieties with 14 C and as shown by the appearance of degradation products in the reaction mixtures. The sugar-amino acid C-N bond was not thought to be cleaved by liver enzymes. The possible role of fructose-lysine as an enzyme inhibitor was examined using enzyme systems in vitro and the molecule was observed to serve as a weak inhibitor of the amino acid-metabolising enzymes, lysine decarboxylase and L-amino acid oxidase, and of some glycosidases. Some preliminary kinetic studies suggest that inhibition was of the competitive type. Fructose-lysine served as a substrate for oxidation by L-amino acid oxidase Lactose-lysine was hydrolysed by beta-galactosidase to fructose-lysine and galactose and also acted as an inhibitor of lactose hydrolysis by this enzyme. The fate of the sugar amino derivatives from milk powder is discussed in relation to their possible effects on digestion and general metabolism of infants. <p...|$|E
