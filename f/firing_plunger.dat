50|$|The new firing {{mechanism}} {{involved a}} new , which was {{inserted into the}} axial breech vent. The crosspiece of the T was positioned pointing upwards. A long layer's guard {{was added to the}} left side of the cradle projecting behind the breech. A spring-loaded firing handle was built into the layer's guard. When cocked by pulling back and then releasing, it sprang forward and struck a firing lever on the breech, which translated the forward motion to a downward motion and propelled a <b>firing</b> <b>plunger</b> into the T of the friction tube which in turn ignited the cordite propellant charge.|$|E
50|$|The {{base plate}} is very heavy and is fitted with four {{carrying}} handles. The sight bracket fits the standard mortar sight. The barrel is heavily reinforced at the muzzle {{and has two}} raised ribs midway of the barrel, between which the barrel clamping collar is held. The firing mechanism {{is similar to that}} used on the Type 99, 81 mm short mortar. After the weapon has been loaded, a plunger, which projects upward from the mortar breech, is struck with a mallet or similar instrument, thus camming out the firing pin and firing the mortar. A safety lock is fitted on this <b>firing</b> <b>plunger.</b>|$|E
5000|$|At 14:02 on 1 August, {{this part}} of [...] "Abe's Abolishers"—Thornback, Angler, and Sea Poacher—made {{landfall}} off their target of Urakawa, Hokkaidō. They swung parallel to the beach with guns manned and ready. Twelve minutes later, slowing to 10 knots (19 km/h), Thornback and her consorts opened fire with 5 in and 40 millimeter batteries at a range of 4200 yd. The first few rounds from Thornback’s five-incher went wild, but the crew soon locked onto the range. Firing by hand after the foot <b>firing</b> <b>plunger</b> broke off, Thornback’s gunners eventually sent 100 rounds of five-inch (127 mm) shells shoreward, heavily damaging a factory and a power plant. [...] "The firing took 22 minutes and was of inestimable value to the entire crew," [...] wrote the submarine's commanding officer. [...] "The training was excellent and the boost to morale tremendous." ...|$|E
50|$|Older pachinko {{machines}} had a spring-loaded lever {{for shooting}} the balls individually, but newer ones use a round knob {{that controls the}} strength of an electrically <b>fired</b> <b>plunger</b> that shoots the balls onto the playing field. When shot, the balls drop through an array of pins; {{some of them will}} fall into the centre gate and start up the slot machine in the centre screen. Every ball that goes into the centre gate results in one spin of the slot machine, but there is a limit on the number of spins at one time because of the possibility of balls passing through the centre gate while a spin is still in progress. Each spin pays out a small number of balls, but the objective is to hit the jackpot. The program of the digital slot machine decides the outcome of the spin when the ball falls through the centre gate, not when the spinning animation plays.|$|R
50|$|The 70mm rocket, {{like the}} 20 cm model, used a mortar fuze. There {{would be no}} set back when the rocket was fired to arm an {{artillery}} fuze. The Japanese mortar fuse for the 81mm and 90mm used a shear wire to make it bore safe. The wire went through the brass body and aluminum <b>firing</b> pin <b>plunger.</b> Upon impact the plunger was forced back, shearing the wire and freeing the plunger to strike the firing pin and detonate the round.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the slide}} of the pistol enters battery, the striker engages the sear. At this point, the sear is held {{back in a}} {{partially}} cocked condition. When the trigger of the M&P is pulled, the trigger bar first engages the <b>firing</b> pin safety <b>plunger,</b> lifting it upward, and releasing firing pin safety. At the rearward extreme of the trigger bar's travel, it engages the sear. The sear is rotated downward by the trigger bar, fully cocking, then releasing the striker. The striker makes contact with the primer of the chambered round, which in turn ignites the gunpowder and propels the bullet forward. According to renowned M&P gunsmith Dan Burwell, the angle on the rear face of the sear creates a camming action against the striker. This camming action moves the striker to the rear very slightly during the trigger pull, thus finishing the [...] "cocking". This system {{is similar to the}} partially tensioned striker found in the Glock series of pistols. When the pistol cycles for the next shot, the striker will be automatically pre-set in a 98% cocked position. Because the striker is only 98% cocked prior to the trigger being pulled, Smith & Wesson classifies the M&P's action as [...] "striker fired (double action only)".|$|R
40|$|Experiments are {{presented}} in which the diffuse interface between two gases is made Rayleigh-Taylor unstable by interaction with a rarefaction wave. The apparatus used consists of a test section where the counter-flow of light and heavy gases generates a diffuse, stably stratified interface. A tank attached {{to the bottom of}} the apparatus is evacuated, and when an appropriate pressure is reached, the interface is perturbed using either a horizontal or a vertical oscillation technique to produce 2 D, 3 D, and multi-mode perturbations. A solenoid <b>plunger</b> <b>fires</b> an arrowhead which ruptures a membrane, generating a rarefaction wave that travels upward toward the interface. When the rarefaction wave impacts the interface, the interface accelerates down toward the vacuum tank, and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and mixing develop in the test section. The instability evolution and mixing are recorded using high-speed CMOS cameras and planar laser Mie scattering of smoke particles seeded in the heavy gas. Additional visualization is undertaken with a high-speed shadowgraph system using three CMOS cameras. Interface diffusion thicknesses are recorded using the Rayleigh scattered light of an unexpanded laser beam. Simulations are conducted using a 1 D numerical characteristics code based on the method of Hoskin (Meth. Comp. Physics, 3, 1964), and using the LLNL research hydrodynamics code Miranda (Cook, Phys. Fluids, 19, 2007). This 1 D code produces Lagrangian interface trajectories while the 2 D and 3 D simulations using Miranda calculate the growth of perturbations. The theory of Chandrasekhar (Chandrasekhar, Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc., 51, 1955) is extended to capture the effects of diffuse interfaces while including viscosity, and dispersion curves are solved for numerically using a Riccati technique. These solutions show that the method of Duff et al. (Phys. Fluids, 5, 1962) may not accurately describe the growth of single modes for large wavenumbers. For large wavenumbers, when the interface has a large diffusion thickness, perturbations are found to grow with the linear growth rate n = 2 Ag/(√πv₀δk²), where A is the Atwood number, g is the acceleration, v₀ is the average kinematic viscosity, δ is the thickness of the interface, and k is the wavenumber of the perturbation. Flat interface experiments exhibit predictable acceleration profiles, but the tail of the rarefaction wave appears at late times reducing the duration of acceleration. Single-mode experiments are conducted for four Atwood numbers including CO₂/SF₆ with A = 0. 49, Air/SF₆ with A = 0. 63, He/CO₂ with A = 0. 82, and He/SF₆ with A = 0. 94. Early time results compare well with linear stability theory when non-constant acceleration and diffusion thickness are accounted for. Simulations show good agreement with experiments into the non-linear growth phase. The CO₂/SF₆ and Air/SF₆ experiments show terminal velocity behavior where buoyancy is balanced by drag, but produce Froude numbers larger than those predicted by the Goncharov model (Phys. Rev. Lett., 88, 2002). Using the Mikaelian model (Phys. Fluids, 21, 2009), improved asymptotic Froude numbers are found. The He/CO₂ and He/SF₆ experiments exhibit free-fall behavior, accelerating freely without external forces, with spike amplitudes proportional to the displacement of the unperturbed interface. Single-mode experiments conducted with 3 D perturbations using CO₂/SF₆ and Air/SF₆ show good agreement with linear stability theory when non-constant acceleration and diffusion thickness are accounted for. Simulations and the model of Mikaelian predict the growth of the spikes up until late time, while the 3 D bubbles reach a terminal velocity more quickly than in simulations. Multi-mode experiments were conducted using Air/SF₆. Multi-mode experiments exhibit nearly t² growth at early times which decays. Using extraction techniques that account for variable acceleration, alpha values are found between ɑ = 0. 02 and ɑ = 0. 04. These alpha values are lower than are seen for most experiments, but are similar to ɑ values seen in miscible experiments...|$|R
