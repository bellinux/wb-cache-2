5|$|In the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> the {{original}} Greek authorities are Duris of Samos, Xenocrates of Sicyon, and Antigonus of Carystus. The anecdotic element has been ascribed to Duris (XXXIV:61); the notices of the successive developments {{of art and}} the list of workers in bronze and painters to Xenocrates; and a large amount of miscellaneous information to Antigonus. Both Xenocrates and Antigonus are named in connection with Parrhasius (XXXV:68), while Antigonus is named in the indexes of XXXIII–XXXIV as a writer on the art of embossing metal, or working it in ornamental relief or intaglio.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting Friedrich's {{patriotism and}} resentment during the 1813 French {{occupation}} of the dominion of Pomerania, motifs from German folklore became increasingly prominent in his work. An anti-French German nationalist, Friedrich used motifs from his native landscape to celebrate Germanic culture, customs and mythology. He {{was impressed by the}} anti-Napoleonic poetry of Ernst Moritz Arndt and Theodor Körner, and the patriotic literature of Adam Müller and Heinrich von Kleist. Moved by the deaths of three friends killed in battle against France, as well as by Kleist's 1808 drama Die Hermannsschlacht, Friedrich undertook a number of paintings in which he intended to convey political symbols solely by means of the landscape—a first in the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>art.</b>|$|E

5|$|Stoddart {{was born}} in Edinburgh and raised in Renfrewshire, where he {{developed}} an early interest {{in the arts and}} music, and later trained in fine art at the Glasgow School of Art (1976–1980) and read the <b>History</b> <b>of</b> <b>Art</b> at the University of Glasgow. During this time he became increasingly critical of contemporary trends in art, such as pop art, and concentrated on creating figurine pieces in clay. Stoddart associates the lack of form in modern art with social decay; in contrast, his works include many classical allusions.|$|E
