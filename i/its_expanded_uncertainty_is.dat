The {{reference}} material of composition with the established metrological characteristics including a certified value and an <b>expanded</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>is</b> {{necessary to ensure}} an effective accuracy and precision control of results of element composition determination in food ingredients and products.

40|$|The {{uncertainty}} of benzene measurements {{obtained by the}} analysis of thermally desorbable Radiello diffusive samplers was evaluated according to the recent standard EN 14662 - 4 (2005). Considering the results of laboratory experiments, all the sources of uncertainty regarding the diffusive sampler method characteristics were accessed for the sampling times of 7 and 14 days. The {{major part of the}} uncertainty budget (> 79 %) was explained by the variation of the sampling rate due to the environmental factors (temperature and concentration level). For weekly sampling, the diffusive sampler method satisfies the data quality objectives of the European Directive to supply the indicative measurements as well as the reference measurement, since the <b>expanded</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>is</b> found lower than 25 %. Using a model-predicted sampling rate which depends on the concentration and temperature, the <b>expanded</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>is</b> significantly decreased. The Radiello sampler was found to give correct results for weekly sampling provided that the range of benzene concentrations remained between 0 and 10 µg. m- 3, which is generally observed in ambient air monitoring. For 2 -week sampling, the <b>expanded</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of measurements exceeds 30 %. However, this diffusive sampler can still be used to carry out an objective evaluation of benzene (minimum quality objective for the accuracy of 100 %).

40|$|Background: Measurement {{uncertainty}} {{characterizes the}} dispersion of the quantity values {{attributed to a}} measurand. Although this concept was introduced to medical laboratories some years ago, not all medical researchers are familiar with it. Therefore, the evaluation and expression of measurement <b>uncertainty</b> must <b>be</b> highlighted using a practical example. Methods: In accordance with the procedure for evaluating and expressing uncertainty, provided by the Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology (JCGM), we used plasma glucose (Glu) as an example and defined it as the measurand. We then analyzed the main sources of uncertainty, evaluated each component of uncertainty, and calculated the combined <b>uncertainty</b> and <b>expanded</b> <b>uncertainty</b> with 2 budgets for single measurements and continuous monitoring, respectively. Results: During the measurement of Glu, the main sources of uncertainty included imprecision, within-subject biological variance (BVw), calibrator uncertainty, and systematic bias. We evaluated the uncertainty of each component to be 1. 26 %, 1. 91 %, 5. 70 %, 0. 42 %, and- 2. 87 % for within-run imprecision, between-day imprecision, BVw, calibrator uncertainty, and systematic bias, respectively. For a single specimen, the <b>expanded</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>was</b> 7. 38 % or 6. 1 ± 0. 45 mmol/L (κ= 2); in continuous monitoring of Glu, the <b>expanded</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>was</b> 13. 58 % or 6. 1 ± 0. 83 mmol/L (κ= 2). Conclusions: We have demonstrated the overall procedure for evaluating and reporting uncertainty with 2 different budgets. The <b>uncertainty</b> <b>is</b> not only related to the medical laboratory in which the measurement is undertaken, but is also associated with the calibrator uncertainty and the biological variation of the subject.

Both binary systems were studied at five temperatures, ranging from (279. 36 to 318. 09) K, atpressures up to 2 MPa. The experimental (vapour + liquid) equilibrium data were measured using an apparatus {{based on the}} ‘‘(static + analytic) ’’ method incorporating a single movable Rapid On-Line Sampler-Injector to sample the liquid and vapour phases at equilibrium. The <b>expanded</b> <b>uncertainties</b> <b>are</b> approximated on average as = 0. 07 K, 0. 008 MPa, and 0. 007 and 0. 009 for the temperature, pressure, and the liquid and vapour mole fractions, respectively. A homogenous maximum-pressure azeotrope was observed for both binary systems at all temperatures studied. The experimental data were correlated with the Peng–Robinson equation of state using the Mathias–Copeman alpha function, paired with theWong–Sandler mixing rule and the Non-Random Two Liquid activity coefficient model. The model provided satisfactory representation of the phase equilibrium data measure...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} procedure including isotope dilution calibration for {{the determination of}} tributyltin (TBT) in sediment samples has been developed. The procedure is based on spiking with isotopically labelled analyte, pressurised liquid extraction (PLE), followed by Grignard-derivatisation and quantification by GC-MS. The method was applied on two unknown sediment samples {{as a part of}} an intercomparison exercise organised by the National Research Council of Canada (NRCC) and LGC (UK) on behalf of the Comité Consultatif pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM). The value found was 103. 6 % ± 3. 1 % of the certified value by use of the reference material PACS- 2, and the detection limit was estimated to be approximately 1. 5 ng/g of sediment as Sn. Repeatability and intermediate precision were calculated as coefficient of variation and their values were 1. 9 % and 3. 2 % respectively. The <b>expanded</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>was</b> calculated according to GUM [], and was 6. 2 % (coverage factor k= 2) and the final values agree with the certified values within their respective uncertainties.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to develop and apply {{pressurized}} liquid extraction combined with GC–MS for more efficient determination of PCBs in sediment samples. The proposed method {{was applied to the}} unknown marine sediment sample. The presented study was performed in the frames of the interlaboratory test organized by the Comité Consultatif pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM–K 25). Validation parameters (selectivity, linearity, LOD, LOQ, range, repeatability, intermediate precision, trueness) of the developed procedure <b>were</b> calculated. Full <b>uncertainty</b> budget <b>was</b> calculated according to the Guide to the Expression of Uncer-tainty in Measurement [1]. Detection limits were below 0. 65 ng g– 1 PCB, while repeatabi-lity and intermediate precision (coefficient of variation) were below 4. 2 % and 5. 6 %, respec-tively. The <b>expanded</b> <b>uncertainties</b> <b>were</b> below 8. 4 % (coverage factor k = 2). Trueness was confirmed by comparing the obtained values with the mean value estimated in the CCQM–K 25 test, similarly as in recovery study, and was in the range 96 – 103 %.

40|$|A new {{universal}} non-contact measurement {{machine design}} for measuring free-form optics with 30 nm <b>expanded</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>is</b> presented. In the cylindrical machine concept, an optical probe with 5 mm range is positioned {{over the surface}} by a motion system. Due to a 2 nd order error effect when measuring smoothly curved surfaces, only 6 position measurement errors are critical (nanometer level). A separate metrology system directly measures these critical errors of the probe and the product relative to a metrology frame, circumventing most stage errors. An <b>uncertainty</b> estimation has <b>been</b> performed for the presented design, including a calibration uncertainty estimation and a dynamic analysis. Machine dynamics certainly cause relative motion between probe and product, but due to the non-contact nature of the measurement and the short metrology loop, these motions do not cause significant measurement errors. The resulting shape measurement error for aspheres up to medium free-forms is between 24 and 37 nm, and 30 - 85 nm for medium to heavily free-form surfaces. The suitability of the proposed design is herewith confirmed. A detailed design and a prototype of the machine are currently being developed...|$|R
