6000|$|... "Let me <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> then," [...] replied Mr. George. [...] "Listen attentively, {{and picture}} to your mind {{precisely}} what I describe, {{and see if}} you understand.|$|E
6000|$|... "His {{visit was}} to me, Herbert, and I will <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> I {{was just going}} to tell you when you first came in, only you began about Castle Richmond." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. How can I <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you?</b> Of {{course the}} blue uniform struck you. Nearly {{a third of}} our people wear it--more assume it now every day. This Labour Company has grown imperceptibly." ...|$|E
5000|$|Pinto (Sanjai Mishra): Nasal-voiced, he has {{a diploma}} in {{constructing}} bombs. That is, bombs that don't explode until Pinto <b>explains</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Go to the police? Of course not. Never {{dreamed of}} it. Too late now. I've let myself be {{mixed up in}} this. You got my consent while I wasn't myself. I <b>explained</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> at the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very little, sir, I am afraid;' I answered, {{speaking}} to him as respectfully and sorrowfully as I felt; 'but pray believe me, I have considered my own worldly position. When I <b>explained</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> we were already engaged--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Look here,' said George, 'this {{piece is}} going to be recast. We're going to {{exchange}} parts. You're rescuing me. See? Never mind why. I haven't time to <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> now. Do you understand?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Me!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Tolman. [...] "Why, my good madam,--miss, I mean,--I couldn't <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{if it were}} to save my life. But what page is it?" [...] said he, {{looking at}} his watch.|$|E
60|$|Now I {{take for}} granted that you are all more learned than these black fellows, and know quick-lime from flour. But still you are not bound to know what quick-lime is. Let me <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You won't be able {{to indulge}} in all your mad schemes," [...] he laughed, [...] "but there'll be enough to help on a few. And you will be among friends. Arthur {{told me he had}} <b>explained</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and that you had agreed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is deplorable, most deplorable. But {{we are not}} {{the people}} to apply to. Your own good sense will tell you that, now that I have <b>explained</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Good morning. I wish you good fortune, and hope you will let us know from time <b>to</b> time how <b>you</b> go on. We always take a keen {{interest}} in the families of those who serve us." [...] Mr. Girdlestone opened the door, and the heart-sick little woman staggered away across the office, still bearing her heavy child.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I did. In {{those days}} the county {{returned}} four Conservatives. I cannot <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> all <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> but <b>it</b> is {{his duty to}} contest the county on the Liberal side." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Having invented it I {{have done}} enough; I {{was going to}} <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> that you might carry it out. But you are so serious, that I will leave it alone. My second joke shall die with me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dearest, I {{am going}} away, to die. It cannot be long now. The {{doctor told me}} to-day. That was why I couldn't speak or <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and was so strange at supper. But I am glad now. Good-by." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Basil, but I {{must never}} sit to you again. There is {{something}} fatal about a portrait. It {{has a life}} of its own. I will come and have tea with you. That will be just as pleasant." ...|$|E
60|$|We can {{at least}} trust our Bible. We can read it honestly, if only there be in us the honest and good heart; we can obey its plain commands, if only we hunger and thirst after righteousness, and desire really to become good men. Read your Bibles for yourselves with a single eye, and with a pure heart which longs to know God's will because <b>it</b> longs <b>to</b> do God's will; and you will need no false prophets, under pretence of <b>explaining</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>to</b> draw <b>you</b> away from the Holy Catholic faith into which you were baptized.|$|R
50|$|In May 1871, aged 16, Rimbaud wrote {{two letters}} {{explaining}} his poetic philosophy. The first was written 13 May to Izambard, in which Rimbaud explained:I'm now making myself as scummy as I can. Why? I {{want to be}} a poet, and I'm working at turning myself into a seer. You won't understand any of this, and I'm almost incapable of <b>explaining</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> The idea is to reach the unknown by the derangement of all the senses. It involves enormous suffering, but one must be strong and be a born poet. It's really not my fault.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, {{it is very}} wonderful, {{but it is not}} a miracle," [...] said Eric. [...] "David told me {{it might}} happen. I had no hope that it would. He could <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> all <b>to</b> <b>you</b> if he were here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I presume not. And I had {{not time}} to <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{when we were}} upon the cliffs, and so I simply {{directed}} you to keep back of us. That would have prevented all trouble, if you had only obeyed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> now. One of {{the boys}} tied a string to a loose lath {{in the side of}} the room, and then having the end of it at his seat, he was pulling it, to make a noise to disturb us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{too late}} now to help it," [...] said de Lescure; [...] "if we both live over this night, I will <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Cathelineau is behind there; we must lead the men to the attack; {{he will be in}} the {{trenches}} immediately." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Try? We'll do it! Now, Betts, <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> both. <b>You</b> {{can do it}} {{smoother}} than I, {{and telling}} them is really the finest point of our little plot. I'll help the good work along afterwards. He'll be out presently. Nail him at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{cannot be}} explained. I cannot <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> even <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and how then can I do <b>it</b> <b>to</b> all the gaping fools {{of the country}} {{who are ready to}} trample upon a man simply because he is in some way {{conspicuous}} among them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} I {{ought to have}} done so. But at any rate I have come <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> all <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> <b>It</b> was {{necessary}} that I should tell some one. There {{seems to be no}} reason to suspect that the man has been killed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A--Gwendolen, there's some {{business}} about property to be explained. I have told Lush {{to come and}} <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> He knows all about these things. I am going out. He can come up now. He's {{the only person who}} can explain. I suppose you'll not mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's like this," [...] {{said the}} Other Professor, hastily drawing {{a long line}} upon the black board, and marking the letters 'A,' 'B,' at the two ends, and 'C' in the middle: [...] "let me <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> If AB were to {{be divided into two}} parts at C--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Appleyard {{had come}} {{prepared}} for possible acceptance. [...] "You had better begin with this," [...] thought Miss Appleyard. [...] "I have marked the passages {{that you should}} learn by heart. Make a note of anything you do not understand, and I will <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> when--when next I happen to be passing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{tell you}} exactly how I {{discovered}} it. At present it is a secret that both my mother and uncle charged me to keep, but when these troubles are over I will <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> all <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> though I should certainly do so to no one else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a foot," [...] said Peter; [...] "that is {{just why}} they sent me, instead of any common messenger; that I might <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> all <b>to</b> <b>you</b> properly. <b>You</b> are not <b>to</b> stir a foot after them; but are to remain here, just where you are, till they return." ...|$|R
6000|$|Elizabeth and Anne {{laughed so}} much that they could neither of them speak for some moments; but when Anne recovered, she took her brother by the arm and whispered, 'Rupert, the less you say about the Turners or Fido, the better. I will <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> all <b>to</b> <b>you</b> when we have an opportunity.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{means it}} is {{irrevocable}} now? I {{want you to}} make quite sure, my dear. This man {{does not belong to}} our world. Even his thoughts must be different from ours. You cannot know anything of his past life--I scarcely think he could <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> He would regard nothing from the same standpoint as we do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you, Metem, who {{are growing}} old, do not {{understand}} what I mean by love, nor will I stay to <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> for were my words as wise as Solomon's, still you would not understand. At the least your money cannot bring you the blessing of Heaven, nor the welfare of your spirit in the eternal life that is to come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye're too inquisitive," [...] said Bax, drawing Tommy towards him, {{and sitting}} {{down on a}} chair, so that the boy's face might be on a level with his. [...] "No doubt Guy will <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in the morning. I say, Tommy, I have {{sometimes}} wondered whether I could depend on the friendship which you so often profess for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The idea of your {{flying into}} a passion because I have {{endeavored}} <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> all <b>to</b> <b>you!</b> At any rate I have your absolute denial, {{and that will}} enable me to deal both with my father and Prodgers." [...] To this Harry made no answer, and {{the two young men}} walked back to Tretton together without many more words between them.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I did {{not wish}} to be seen," [...] I said, as we hurried to the hotel; [...] "and I can never be {{sufficiently}} thankful that it was you who found me and brought me down. Do you know that it is Mr. Gilbert and his daughter who have just arrived? I must see him instantly. I will <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> all <b>to</b> <b>you</b> when I come upstairs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>explained</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> at the time, dear. That {{was only}} a {{security}} and behind that Security there is a debt. And that debt must be paid {{within the next few}} months, else we shall have our furniture sold. If young Plymdale will take our house and most of our furniture, we shall be able to pay that debt, and some others too, and we shall be quit of a place too expensive for us. We might take a smaller house: Trumbull, I know, has a very decent one to let at thirty pounds a-year, and this is ninety." [...] Lydgate uttered this speech in the curt hammering way with which we usually try to nail down a vague mind to imperative facts. Tears rolled silently down Rosamond's cheeks; she just pressed her handkerchief against them, and stood looking at the large vase on the mantel-piece. It was a moment of more intense bitterness than she had ever felt before. At last she said, without hurry and with careful emphasis-- ...|$|R
