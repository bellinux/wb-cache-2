5|$|The current {{building}} {{was constructed in}} the 15th century {{on the site of}} a wooden building dating from the 12th century. In the 16th century a new facade was added to the original building. It is possible that the stonework and window of the <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> were removed from the abbot's lodgings behind the great kitchen of the Abbey as similar features can be identified in a 1712 engraving, and it is known that the {{building was}} ruined and without its <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> by 1723.|$|E
5|$|Cave 18 is {{a dining}} hall with a <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> and a grooved doorway, {{on either side}} of which are windows. A bench runs along the back and side walls. The passage to the hall has 3 broken steps and an open court in the front. A cistern is located {{to the left of the}} court.|$|E

50|$|Wetherby Town Hall and its <b>front</b> <b>walls</b> are grade II listed buildings. The Classical style two-storey {{town hall}} is built of {{sandstone}} {{and has a}} Welsh slate hipped roof.|$|R
5|$|Cave 19 is a cell {{without a}} <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> and a bench {{runs along the}} left wall. The ceiling shows signs of a dressed stone or wooden screen from the right wall {{to the end of}} the bench. To the right is a small cell in the same roof, {{probably}} connected with cave 19. The small cell has a bench along its right wall and the grooved doorway. The cave has two cisterns.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of the G-spot is typically reported as being about 50 to 80mm (2 to 3in) inside the vagina, on the <b>front</b> <b>wall.</b> For some women, stimulating this area creates a more intense orgasm than clitoral stimulation. The G-spot area {{has been described as}} needing direct stimulation, such as two fingers pressed deeply into it. Attempting to stimulate the area through sexual penetration, especially in the missionary position, is difficult because of the particular angle of penetration required.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower jaw}} of Dermotherium major {{resembles that of}} living colugos in the {{presence}} of a strong angular process (a projecting piece of bone at the lower side of the back of the jawbone) and a retromolar space (a flat space behind the last molars). The coronoid process (a projecting piece of bone directly behind the molars) rises steeply, with its <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> virtually vertical.|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a cylindrical separator apparatus for separating mixtures of solids of different specific gravities, {{particularly for the}} mining industry. The apparatus according to the invention is formed by a hollow cylindrical body, which is divided by a partition wall into two consecutive chambers communicating with each other through an axial pipe provided in the partition wall. An axial inlet pipe and an axial outlet pipe are provided in the <b>front</b> <b>walls</b> of said chambers opposite to the partition wall. Tangential inlet pipes and tangential outlet pipes are further provided {{in the vicinity of}} the partition wall and of the respective <b>front</b> <b>walls</b> of said chamber...|$|R
50|$|The {{church has}} a twin-towered facade with There are four {{additional}} side entrances, that provides entry {{directly into the}} nave, each face the front: a single door next to each tower and a single door in the <b>front</b> <b>walls</b> of the transept.|$|R
50|$|Amasra Castle {{was built}} during the Roman period. The {{walls of the}} castle were built by the Byzantines. The <b>front</b> <b>walls</b> and gates were built by the Genoese in the 14th and 15th centuries. Though located on a narrow peninsula, a tunnel under the castle leads to a fresh water pool.|$|R
5|$|The top tower {{along the}} <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> of the forward compound, tower 6, has a square base which was {{reinforced}} with a six-sided foundation. Working west, the square base of tower 7 was reinforced with a circular foundation. Tower 8, {{on the upper}} side of the front portcullis, has an irregular, but generally square, base. It is also the shortest of the first nine towers. Guarding {{the other side is}} tower 9, which has a square base reinforced by an eight-sided foundation.|$|E
5|$|The wooden stairs {{leading to}} the first floor {{replaced}} an earlier stone staircase, the remains of which can be seen protruding from the walls. The front room on the first floor had previously been partitioned, but the larger space was created when the new <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> was added to the building. Its roof has arched braced wooden trusses. The rear room still has the remains of a large fireplace, however, the chimney was blocked when the downstairs fireplace was installed.|$|E
5|$|Group 18 Structure 2 is on {{the east}} side of the plaza. Its {{earliest}} phase dates to the Late Preclassic. The Preclassic remains consist of a low north wall running east-west. A later construction phase was built over this. It consisted of a rectangular platform that supported a bench. A small pyrite disc was found near the <b>front</b> <b>wall.</b> Obsidian prismatic blades were found on top of the platform, together with pieces of a thin earthenware bowl. Burial 69 was found in front of the base of the platform.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also known}} by some who live there as the 'village of the saints' because of the 19 statues of saints in niches on the <b>front</b> <b>walls</b> of houses and other {{buildings}} in Upper Froyle. They were bought by Sir Hubert Miller in the early 20th century from Italy.|$|R

5|$|The {{building}} has two rooms and an attached kitchen {{on the ground}} floor with a staircase between them leading to the living quarters in the first floor rooms. The front room may originally have been a shop but was not used for trade after the installation of the new <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> in the 16th century. The front room has recesses {{on either side of the}} arched fireplace. The rear room {{on the ground floor}} was the hall and still has its 16th-century ceiling panels and four-light window. The ceiling has plaster decorations from the Elizabethan era, when the kitchen block was also added.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the {{building}} is not well documented, {{although the majority of}} the present stone house was constructed in the 15th century on the site of a 12th-century wooden building. The current <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> was added in the 16th century. It {{has been used as a}} merchant's house and possibly a shop and school. It was thought that it was the venue for court proceedings, hence the title Tribunal, however there is no evidence this ever occurred. One of the ground floor rooms still has the window and ceiling panels from the Elizabethan era. The front room upstairs has an arched braced, wooden, truss roof.|$|E
5|$|Much more {{is known}} of the {{hundreds}} of unique cleitean that decorate the archipelago. These dome-shaped structures are constructed of flat boulders with a cap of turf on the top. This enables the wind to pass through the cavities in the wall but keeps the rain out. They were used for storing peat, nets, grain, preserved flesh and eggs, manure, and hay, and as a shelter for lambs in winter. The date of origin of this St Kildan invention is unknown, but they were in continuous use from prehistoric times until the 1930 evacuation. More than 1,200 ruined or intact cleitean remain on Hirta and a further 170 on the neighbouring islands. House no. 16 in the modern village has an early Christian stone cross built into the <b>front</b> <b>wall,</b> which may date from the 7th century.|$|E

5|$|Through {{the main}} {{doors of the}} Main Stand is a wood-panelled hallway. A {{staircase}} leads to the boardroom and trophy room. Inglis compared Ibrox to Highbury, in that it combined corporate power {{with a sense of}} tradition and solidity. It was originally constructed as a 10,000-seat stand above a standing enclosure. It was redeveloped in the early 1990s with the addition of the Club Deck and seating in the enclosure. It is now a three-tier all-seated structure, accommodating approximately 21,000 spectators. The <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> of the middle tier {{is one of the last}} surviving examples of the Leitch style of criss-cross detailing. The middle tier is split into front and rear sections, while the enclosure is split into east and west sections, either side of the retractable tunnel cover.|$|E
5|$|On 10 October 1872 at St Mary's Church, Balmain Selfe married Emily Ann Booth, the {{daughter}} of John Booth, a well-known shipbuilder and Balmain's first mayor (and formerly the member for East Macquarie in the colonial parliament). They lived for many years at Rockleigh in Donnelly Street, Balmain, a house that has since been demolished. In 1884 their first daughter Rhoda Jane was born, followed by a stillborn daughter in 1886, and then Norma Catherine in 1888. In 1885 Selfe bought land in Ashfield and designed a grand house called Amesbury. Described {{at the time as}} having “more novelties both externally and internally than any other house in the colony” including terracotta lyrebird reliefs by artist Lucien Henry on the <b>front</b> <b>wall,</b> and a tower purpose-built for Selfe to pursue his hobby of astronomy. Built around 1888 to honour the centenary of the colony, Amesbury still stands at 78 Alt Street and was used by Brahma Kumaris from 1986 as its Australian headquarters until 2014 when it was auctioned for over $3.5 million. As children, Rhoda and Norma attended their Aunt Maybanke's school in Dulwich Hill. As adults, they trained in Italy with educator Maria Montessori and returned to Sydney to open a Montessori school of their own in the building known as Warwick on Bland Street, Ashfield.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} walls to a squash court. The <b>front</b> <b>wall,</b> on which three {{parallel}} lines are marked, {{has the largest}} playing surface, whilst the back wall, which typically contains {{the entrance to the}} court, has the smallest. The out line runs {{along the top of the}} <b>front</b> <b>wall,</b> descending along the side walls to the back wall. There are no other markings on the side or back walls. Shots struck above or touching the out line, on any wall, are out. The bottom line of the <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> marks the top of the 'tin', a half metre-high metal area which if struck means that the ball is out. In this way the tin can be seen as analogous to the net in other racket sports such as tennis. The middle line of the <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> is the service line and is only relevant during serves.|$|E

The honoured parent steering Northward, had not gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and the two trudged on together.|$|R
25|$|Boast: The ball {{is played}} off a side wall at an angle, or the back wall, {{before hitting the}} <b>front</b> <b>wall.</b> A 'three wall boast' has the ball hit at a side wall such that the ball hits the <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> {{followed}} by the opposite side wall before finally hitting the floor. A 'back wall boast' has the ball struck {{against the back wall}} before reaching the <b>front</b> <b>wall.</b> It is typically not recommended to beginners due to the risk of hitting spectators above and behind players on solid backed courts. A 'trickle boast' is a boast performed at a shallow angle with the <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> at a low trajectory. A 'reverse boast' is a boast played towards the sidewall furtherst from the striker. It is played rarely at high levels due to the high risk of hitting the opponent and the typical ease of counterattack.|$|E

50|$|Parts of {{the chapel}} {{date back to the}} 16th century. It {{consists}} of three aisles and the Baroque interior was installed in 1747. At the <b>front</b> <b>walls</b> of the side aisles, sandstone epitaphs of Bertram von Nesselrode, his wife Lucia von Hatzfeld, and Bertram's parents Franz von Nesselrode and Anna Maria von Wylich can be found. These epitaphs were made in 1680/81 and were originally in another Herten church.|$|R
