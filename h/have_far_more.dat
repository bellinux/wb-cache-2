5|$|With the {{exception}} of the cormorants and some terns, and in common with most other birds, all seabirds have waterproof plumage. However, compared to land birds, they <b>have</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> feathers protecting their bodies. This dense plumage is better able to protect the bird from getting wet, and cold is kept out by a dense layer of down feathers. The cormorants possess a layer of unique feathers that retain a smaller layer of air (compared to other diving birds) but otherwise soak up water. This allows them to swim without fighting the buoyancy that retaining air in the feathers causes, yet retain enough air to prevent the bird losing excessive heat through contact with water.|$|E

Oils with high viscosity and heavy gravity do not float on water, but sink.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies {{conducted}} among the Muslim youth in various western European countries have showed that Muslim children <b>have</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> antisemitic ideas than Christian children- in 2011 Mark Elchardus, a Belgian sociologist, published a report on Dutch-language elementary schools in Brussels. He found that about 50 percent of Muslim students in second and third grade could be considered anti-Semites, versus 10% of others. In the same year Unther Jikeli published his findings from the 117 interviews he conducted with Muslim male youngsters (average age 19) in Berlin, Paris and London. The majority of the interviewees voiced some, or strong antisemitic feelings. They expressed them openly and often aggressively.|$|E
25|$|Shift {{workers who}} work {{throughout}} the night {{have been known to}} <b>have</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> accidents as opposed to daytime workers. This can be attributed to several factors, including fewer staff and fatigue; however, part of the problem may be the workers poor working memory and poor performance skills due to poor memory consolidation. Both implicitly learned tasks and explicitly learned tasks improve by roughly 20% after a full nights sleep. Without an adequate nights sleep between learning a new task and performance of that task, performance fails to improve. Shift workers who are not given an adequate amount of sleep, particularly in the NREM stage, between learning and performance of a task will not perform as well as workers who maintain a standard sleep routine.|$|E

Days later, a survey of 130 UAW local leaders in Michigan showed that Ephlin and Bieber had the most {{grassroots}} support, with Majerus a distant fourth behind Yokich. But Majerus appeared to <b>have</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> support on the UAW executive board, where African American Vice President Marc Stepp was vocal in his support of the Majerus campaign. One media report estimated that Majerus {{had the support of}} as many as 10 of the 26 board members, while Bieber (whose campaign had been targeting regional directors and workers) may have had as many as 12 votes. Nonetheless, others considered Bieber a dark horse candidate because of the significant dissatisfaction the GM concessionary contract had generated.|$|E
25|$|Every living {{organism}} (with {{the possible exception}} of RNA viruses) contains molecules of DNA, which carries genetic information. Genes are the pieces of DNA that carry this information, and they influence the properties of an organism. Genes determine an individual's general appearance and to some extent their behavior. If two organisms are closely related, their DNA will be very similar. On the other hand, the more distantly related two organisms are, the more differences they will have. For example, brothers are closely related and have very similar DNA, while cousins share a more distant relationship and <b>have</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> differences in their DNA. Similarities in DNA are used to determine the relationships between species in much the same manner as they are used to show relationships between individuals. For example, comparing chimpanzees with gorillas and humans shows that there is as much as a 96percent similarity between the DNA of humans and chimps. Comparisons of DNA indicate that humans and chimpanzees are more closely related to each other than either species is to gorillas.|$|E
25|$|Another wrinkle in {{the issue}} is the unnatural {{geographic}} location of this Eastern-Time-Zoned region. In the western Indiana counties where Eastern time is observed (South Bend and Lafayette south to Terre Haute and Vincennes), around the summer solstice, the sun neither sets until after 9:20 pm, nor does it reach solar noon until almost 2:00 pm. During the winter months when standard time is observed, school buses in western regions lose a valuable hour of the sun's rays as they pick up children in the morning. Another notable observation is that schools in the Eastern Time Zone of Indiana tend to <b>have</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> 2-hour delays, mainly {{due to the fact that}} sunlight is required for many road de-icing components to work. With the sun rising as late as 8:20 am in some areas, available sunlight is inadequate to safely thaw the roads for school buses to pick up all their passengers on time. The argument is that if the same area were in its geographically natural Central time zone, the sun would be up an hour sooner, and it would have an additional hour to thaw the roads every morning.|$|E

25|$|Giger's {{original}} {{design for the}} facehugger was a much larger creature with eyes and a spring-loaded tail. Later, in response to comments from the filmmakers, Giger reduced the creature's size substantially. At first, Giger assumed that the facehugger would wrap around {{the outside of the}} astronaut's helmet, but Scott decided that it would <b>have</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> impact if the facehugger were revealed once the helmet was removed. Scott and Giger realised that the facehugger should burn through the helmet's faceplate with its acid blood; subsequent redesigns of the space helmet included a far larger faceplate to allow for this. Dan O'Bannon initially conceived the facehugger as somewhat resembling an octopus, possessing tentacles. However, when he received H. R. Giger's designs, which substituted tentacles with fingerlike digits, he found Giger's design concept to be superior. Since no one was available at the time, O'Bannon decided to design the facehugger prop himself. The technical elements of the musculature and bone were added by Ron Cobb. Giger's initial design for the smaller facehugger had the fingers facing forward, but O'Bannon's redesign shifted the legs to the side. When the foam rubber sculpture of the facehugger was produced, O'Bannon asked that it should remain unpainted, believing the rubber, which resembled human skin, was more plausible.|$|E

500|$|It {{was once}} a common {{practice}} to give horses a weekly bran mash of wheat bran mixed with warm water and other ingredients. [...] It is still done regularly in some places. [...] While a warm, soft meal is a treat many horses enjoy, and was once considered helpful for its laxative effect, it is not nutritionally necessary. [...] An old horse with poor teeth may benefit from food softened in water, a mash may help provide extra hydration, and a warm meal may be comforting in cold weather, but horses <b>have</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> fiber in their regular diet than do humans, and so any assistance from bran is unnecessary. There is also a risk that too much wheat bran may provide excessive phosphorus, unbalancing the diet, and a feed of unusual contents fed only once a week could trigger a bout of colic.|$|E
500|$|Seeds of Evil was {{originally}} designed to fit in a 12MB Nintendo 64 cartridge. Nevertheless, when cartridges prices fell, the storage was increased to 16MB, allowing the development team to add a multiplayer mode. The multiplayer levels were designed so that players could have all sort of mobility, including running, jumping, climbing and swimming. According to Dienstbier, this freedom of movement [...] "means that [...] have a lot less predictable death match play because [...] <b>have</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> possible escape routes within each level." [...] Unlike the single-player levels, the multiplayer maps feature more basic geometry. This choice was made to ensure a smooth frame rate. The cartridge size was ultimately increased to 32MB, which was the largest size for a Nintendo 64 game at the time. The actual development of the game took overall 21 months to complete and over 10,000 hours of game testing were reportedly conducted.|$|E

500|$|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559 {{called for}} the {{disarmament}} of militia with the Taif agreement {{at the end of}} the Lebanese civil war. Hezbollah denounced, and protested against, the resolution. The 2006 military conflict with Israel has increased the controversy. Failure to disarm remains a violation of the resolution and agreement as well as subsequent United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. Since then both Israel and Hezbollah have asserted that the organization has gained in military strength. A Lebanese public opinion poll taken in August 2006 shows that most of the Shia did not believe that Hezbollah should disarm after the 2006 Lebanon war, while the majority of Sunni, Druze and Christians believed that they should.

500|$|The whale eye is {{relatively}} small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, {{the eyes of a}} whale are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When belugas surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they <b>have</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> rod cells than they do cone cells. Whales do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for [...] colour vision than most mammals. Most whales have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a [...] tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area. In water, a whale can see around [...] ahead of itself, but they have a smaller range above water. They also have glands on the eyelids and outer corneal layer that act as protection for the cornea.|$|E
