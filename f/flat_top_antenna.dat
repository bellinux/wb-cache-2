The equipment used was a 1.5Kw Telefunken spark transmitter and a <b>flat</b> <b>top</b> <b>antenna.</b> Atmospheric conditions associated with the Aurora Australis interfered with radio transmissions on many occasions, but the expedition parties were generally able to receive news {{from the outside world}} reasonably regularly via the relay station on Macquarie Island.|$|E

30|$|A {{new class}} of all-fiber beam shaping devices has been {{realized}} by inverse etching the end face of single mode and multimode fibers to form a concave cone tip. Concave tip fiber can convert a Gaussian beam profile to a <b>flat</b> <b>top</b> beam profile with a uniform intensity distribution. A <b>flat</b> <b>top</b> beam with intensity variation of approx. 5 % and <b>flat</b> <b>top</b> diameter to spot diameter ratio of 67 % has been achieved. This device can also change the beam shape from a Gaussian to a donut by moving the observation plane. A <b>flat</b> <b>top</b> multimode fiber beam delivery is attractive for applications which require high power and uniform intensity distribution. In single mode fiber, concave tips {{could be used to}} reduce the beam spot size diameter, enabling efficient light coupling from a single mode fiber to an integrated optical waveguide.|$|R

40|$|As for the {{sophisticated}} advanced support technique of vertical wall semicircle arch roadway in the three-soft coal seam, a design of <b>flat</b> <b>top</b> U-shape roadway section was put forward. Based on the complex function method, the surrounding rock displacement and stress distribution laws both of vertical wall semicircle arch roadway and of <b>flat</b> <b>top</b> U-shape roadway were obtained. The {{results showed that}} the displacement distribution laws in the edge of roadway surrounding rock were similar between the two different roadways and the area of plasticity proportion of <b>flat</b> <b>top</b> U-shape roadway approximately equals that of vertical wall semicircle arch roadway. Based on finite element method, the bearing behaviors of the U-type steel support under the interaction of surrounding rock in vertical wall semicircle arch roadway and <b>flat</b> <b>top</b> U-shape roadway were analyzed. The results showed that, from a mechanics perspective, U-type steel support can fulfill the requirement of surrounding rock supporting in <b>flat</b> <b>top</b> U-shape roadway and vertical wall semicircle arch roadway.

40|$|We {{have made}} time-resolved {{measurements}} the angular distribu-tion of low energy phonons (l-phonons) that {{are created by}} a heater in liquid helium, at several powers and pulse lengths, in order to inves-tigate the temporal and spatial development of such l-phonon pulses. The angular distributions show a mesa shape with a <b>flat</b> <b>top</b> in the direction normal to the heater. The width of the <b>flat</b> <b>top</b> increases with power and pulse length. We argue that the <b>flat</b> <b>top</b> {{is due to the}} creation of high energy phonons (h-phonons). These are created until the temperature of the central region of the l-phonon sheet reaches 0. 7 K, when the creation of h-phonons essentially stops. Outside of the <b>flat</b> <b>top,</b> the angular distribution is due the lateral spreading of the l-phonon sheet. A model for this is described in the preceding paper [1], which gives a framework for considering these measurements. ...|$|R
