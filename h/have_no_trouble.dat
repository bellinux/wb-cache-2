5|$|By {{the time}} Channon reached the two platoons, they were {{crossing}} over two small hills {{just north of}} Kantongyon. As they crossed {{over one of the}} hills, Channon and his radio operator were wounded by Chinese mortar rounds. Channon took the radio from Walker, who was now incapacitated, and joined the two platoons {{at the bottom of the}} hill. Channon then called Jess Tidwell for instructions, who responded, “move out when the tanks move out.” Two tanks had passed through a gap in the hills and were in front of them. Soon, the two tanks moved out at high speed to join their company in the center of the valley. As the Rangers started to move forward, toward the nose of a ridge from which the fire was coming about 700-800 yards ahead, they began taking casualties from machine gun and rifle fire. About 100 yards out from the ridge, they received a heavy mortar barrage, resulting in a number of them being wounded. Channon also received a couple of burp gun rounds to his lower left leg. Shortly after, a couple of light tanks arrived. Pete Hamilton (1st Plt Ldr) and Channon crawled up on the tanks, bore-sighted the guns on the machine guns and blew them away. About 30 yards out from a Chinese trench at the base of the ridge nose, they received a heavy volley of grenades. Abandoning protocol (once you start a charge, you are not supposed to hit the ground), Channon, knowing that he’d <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> getting his Rangers up again, had them hit the ground. When they got up, the Rangers took the ridge nose in a bayonet and grenade fight. When their position was secure, Platoon Sergeant Barber reported that they only had eight Rangers capable of continuing on. Pete Hamilton had been too seriously wounded to continue.|$|E

25|$|Many {{long-established}} words, such as disgusted, degrade, and refresh, do {{not require}} a hyphen because they are fully fused {{to the point that}} their first syllable is barely even thought about as having a prefix function. Many other words, such as prewashed or repainted, may not be quite so fully fused (the prefix function may be slightly more prominent in consciousness), but nonetheless they require no hyphen, because (1) most readers recognize the closed-up word as a familiar one and thus <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> parsing the syllables, and (2) if all such words were hyphenated, the many hyphens throughout the text would seem superfluous.|$|E

25|$|The European train {{cars are}} {{narrower}} than the North American standard. In order to enable night-time {{use of the}} line by standard-width freight services, retractable platform extenders are mounted at each station (other than Bayview which is constructed on its own private rail spur). Passengers {{gain access to the}} Trillium Line on these extenders, three sets of which are visible in the above photo (at the location of the solid yellow platform markings). If the line is used for freight, the extenders are retracted allowing a wider train to pass through the station. The extender interface with the train has been refined over time, and cyclists and wheelchair users now <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> accessing the train.|$|E
25|$|Some representatives mistrusted {{proposals}} to enlarge federal powers, {{because they were}} concerned about the inherent risks of centralizing power. Federalists, including James Madison, initially argued that a bill of rights was unnecessary, sufficiently confident that the federal government could never raise a standing army powerful enough to overcome a militia. Federalist Noah Webster argued that an armed populace would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> resisting the potential threat to liberty of a standing army. Anti-federalists, on the other hand, advocated amending the Constitution with clearly defined and enumerated rights providing more explicit constraints on the new government. Many Anti-federalists feared the new federal government would choose to disarm state militias. Federalists countered that in listing only certain rights, unlisted rights might lose protection. The Federalists realized there was insufficient support to ratify the Constitution without a bill of rights and so they promised to support amending the Constitution to add a bill of rights following the Constitution's adoption. This compromise persuaded enough Anti-federalists to vote for the Constitution, allowing for ratification. The Constitution was declared ratified on June 21, 1788, when nine of the original thirteen states had ratified it. The remaining four states later followed suit, although the last two states, North Carolina and Rhode Island, ratified only after Congress had passed the Bill of Rights and sent it to the states for ratification. James Madison drafted what ultimately became the Bill of Rights, which was proposed by the first Congress on June 8, 1789, and was adopted on December 15, 1791.|$|E
500|$|Early in the season, as the Ohio Works team {{prepared}} for a second game with the Zanesville Moguls (close rivals in the 1905 championship games), the club manager, Hogan, spoke confidently on their chances of capturing the league pennant. [...] "If the boys go through the season as they are playing now, we will <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> winning out", he said to a reporter with The Youngstown Daily Vindicator. [...] "Our pitchers are in good condition and are holding the opposing batsmen to few hits. It is the pitching staff that has saved many a game for us. We have no [...]350 batters on the club, but any man on it is liable {{to step in and}} break up a game". A local newspaper confirmed Hogan's assessment of the team, observing that only one player, outfielder Will Thomas, had worked up a batting average of [...]306. Nevertheless, as Hogan predicted, the team defeated the Moguls, with a final score of 11–8. The game's highlights included the pitching of [...] "Long John" [...] Kennedy, who kept the Moguls to seven hits, and the batting of Edward Hilley, who [...] "unloosened a drive to middle field that permitted him {{to go all the way}} around".|$|E

500|$|By 1962, Glock {{had persuaded}} the BBC {{management}} {{to increase the}} orchestra's budget to allow for joint principals in the string sections, to attract top musicians who could play in the BBC SO without having {{to give up their}} solo or chamber careers. The following season, he was able to engage joint principals for the wind section, including as Jack Brymer and Terence MacDonagh, formerly members of Beecham's celebrated [...] "Royal Family" [...] in the RPO. The problem remained that recruiting rank-and-file string players was difficult: although the BBC offered secure employment and a pension, it did not pay as well as its London rivals. After 1964, the BBC SO {{was the only one of}} the five London symphony orchestras that was not self-governed, and some musicians felt that the BBC SO's constitution as a body of salaried employees, with no say in the management or repertory of the orchestra, attracted an unadventurous type of player. A former member of the BBC SO said in 1979, I felt I was getting too secure ... the BBC Symphony you can be a poor player, but if you're on time and never moan at the conductor … you'll <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble...</b> I think the BBC Symphony lost some good young players because the management got their priorities wrong.|$|E

According to Henry Glover, Harris's record producer, Elvis [...] "copied many of the vocal {{gymnastics}} of Wynonie {{as well as the}} physical gyrations. When you saw Elvis, you were seeing a mild version of Wynonie". Harris remarked in a 1956 interview that Elvis's hip movements were stirring controversy in a way his own never did: [...] "Many people have been giving him trouble for swinging his hips. I swing mine and <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble.</b> He's got publicity I could not buy".|$|E
2500|$|Pius XII {{retained}} Orsenigo as nuncio to Germany; {{his priorities}} (as he {{made clear to}} Orsenigo) were {{the preservation of the}} Reichskonkordat specifically, and Vatican-German relations more generally. According to Phayer, [...] "In Orsenigo, Pius had the right man for the job. A pro-German, pro-Nazi, antisemitic fascist, Orsenigo would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> adjusting to the Nazi regime in Berlin. In addition, Orsenigo who hankered after the cardinal's hat, could be trusted not to interfere with Pius's well-known intention to deal with Germany himself". On the orders of Pius XII, Orsenigo warmly and publicly congratulated Hitler on April 20, 1939, the Führer's fiftieth birthday.|$|E

2500|$|In 1963, Deutsch {{retired as}} a {{training}} analyst {{in part due to}} her husband, Felix’s, declining health and memory loss. In 1963, Felix Deutsch died. Following his death, Helene Deutsch began to reminisce about her life with Felix and all that he had given her. Her relationship with Felix, up to that point, had always been a little bit strained. Through numerous affairs, like the one she had with Sándor Rado, Deutsch had always felt that Felix was more of the mother figure than she. According to Deutsch, [...] "Felix seemed to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> in 'naturally' displaying all the motherly ease. Even in situations in which a child usually calls for his mother, [...] turned more often to Felix than to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kuhn and Brass {{now knew}} what to expect: primary {{response}} trials, any failed stop trials, and the [...] "failed-to-decide" [...] trials were all instances where the participant obviously acted impulsively – they would show the same quick RT. In contrast, the [...] "successful decide" [...] trials (where the decision was a [...] "go" [...] and the subject moved) should show a slower RT. Presumably, if deciding whether to veto is a conscious process, volunteers should <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> distinguishing impulsivity from instances of true deliberate continuation of a movement. Again, this is important since decide trials require that participants rely on self-knowledge. Note that stop trials cannot test self-knowledge because if the subject does act, it is obvious {{to them that they}} reacted impulsively.|$|E

Kiplinger's personal finance magazine, Changing Times, listed the AMC Gremlin as first among the best subcompact used cars as [...] "selected by top mechanics for good value, good service." [...] Five years after the Gremlin's introduction, the mechanics liked the six-cylinder engine and most preferred automatic transmission. Comments included, [...] "I have one. It's the greatest.

2500|$|Williams began 2007 {{with renewed}} confidence, stating her {{intention}} {{to return to}} the top of the rankings, a comment 1987 Wimbledon men's singles champion and commentator Pat Cash branded [...] "deluded." [...] Williams lost in the quarterfinals of the tournament in Hobart, Australia, a warm-up for the Australian Open. Williams was unseeded at the Australian Open because of her world No. 81 ranking and was widely regarded as [...] "out of shape." [...] Williams experienced a huge amount of pressure on herself prior to the tournament, coming from her fans and the press as well as Serena herself about her weight, focus and needing a good showing. Shortly before her first match, a representative from Nike paid Williams a visit in the players' lounge, informing her that if she didn't perform to her accustomed level, the company might drop her. Williams claimed that Nike's ultimatum meant that she would have to reach the quarterfinals at least. The distraction from Nike did not distract Williams, as she lost just three games to Mara Santangelo and defeated Anne Kremer in straight sets. By this point, a blister had developed on Williamses' foot and she had contracted a cold. In the third round, Williams found herself two points away from going home against Nadia Petrova, but fought back to win in three sets, which was her first win over a top-10 player since defeating Lindsay Davenport in the 2005 Australian Open final. Williams then made it all the way to the final, defeating Janković, Pe'er and Vaidišová. Williams described them as [...] "good players. Strong players. Players who certainly didn't expect an overweight, out-of-shape, has been champion like me to give them a game.". Williams also found herself two points from going out against Peer before turning it around. By the time Williams had reached the final, the cold and blister had both left. Previewing the finals, Tracy Austin stated that, although Serena had a great tournament, she believed that the ride was over and that Sharapova would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> with Williams. Serena thought it was mean and unnecessary and used it as motivation along with other criticism. In the final, Williams lost just three games against Maria Sharapova winning her first title at any tournament since winning the 2005 Australian Open 24 months prior. Williams became the first player since Chris O'Neil to win the title whilst not being seeded, and claimed her third Australian Open and eighth Grand Slam singles title overall. The win elevated Williams to 14th in the rankings. Williams dedicated the title to her deceased half-sister Yetunde. Her performance in the final was described in the press as [...] "one of the best performances of her career" [...] and [...] "arguably the most powerful display ever seen in women's tennis." [...] In her post match interview, Williams took a swipe at her critics, stating that she had proved them wrong.|$|E
