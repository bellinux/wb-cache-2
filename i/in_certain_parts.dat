5|$|The Asiatic dayflower is {{considered}} a weed both in areas where it was introduced and <b>in</b> <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> of its native range. The flowers' interactions with pollinators have been well studied and have helped to support important hypotheses about pollination {{in the field of}} plant ecology. Recent research has also revealed that the Asiatic dayflower can bioaccumulate a number of metals, making it a candidate for revegetating and essentially cleaning spoiled copper mines. Several animals and fungi use the plant as a food source, with a few species feeding upon it exclusively.|$|E
5|$|Croatian Serb forces turned Ovčara into {{a prison}} camp in early October 1991. Aside from the massacre, 3,000–4,000 male prisoners were {{temporarily}} {{held in the}} Ovčara camp {{at some point during}} autumn of 1991 before being transported to the prison in Sremska Mitrovica or to the local JNA barracks, which was the transit point for Serbian detention camps such as Stajićevo and Begejci. Following a series of political agreements concluded in 1991 and a ceasefire between the JNA and Croatia in early 1992, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed for peacekeeping <b>in</b> <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> of Croatia, including Vukovar and its surroundings.

5|$|In the 1970s, {{southeast}} Asian jungle cats {{still used}} to be the most common wild cats near villages <b>in</b> <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> of northern Thailand and occurred in many protected areas of the country. However, since the early 1990s, jungle cats are rarely encountered and have suffered drastic declines due to hunting and habitat destruction. Today, their official status in the country is critically endangered. In Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, jungle cats have been subject to extensive hunting. Skins are occasionally recorded in border markets, and live individuals, possibly taken from Myanmar or Cambodia, occasionally turn up in the Khao Khieo and Chiang Mai zoos of Thailand.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the game's release, several {{trailers}} {{were released}} for it, detailing its development progress and the improvements <b>in</b> <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> of the game. The game also had three pre-order tiers, each coming with different amounts of in-game content. A public beta {{for the game}} was initiated prior to the game's release for testing. It contained the HUT, EASHL and Online Versus modes {{as well as the}} Creation Zone. Critics who played the beta wrote generally positive reviews and noted it as a good precursor to the full game. Upon its release, NHL 17 received generally positive reviews from critics. The gameplay improvements and new additions to the game mainly received praise, while criticism was aimed at some lack of depth and general innovation.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} ovoviviparous, with females {{giving birth to}} one to 16 live young and {{possibly}} as many as 20. However, litters of six to eight are the most common. Neonates are 22–35cm in length (excluding runts), with the largest being A. p. conanti and A. p. leucostoma the smallest. If weather conditions are favorable and food is readily available, growth is rapid and females may reproduce at {{less than three years}} of age and a total length of as little as 60cm. The young are born in August or September, while mating may occur during any of the warmer months of the year, at least <b>in</b> <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> of its range.|$|E

5|$|A dun-colored {{coat with}} {{primitive}} markings {{that include a}} dorsal stripe and often leg striping and transverse shoulder stripes reflect the wildtype coat and are observed in most wild extant equine species. Only the mountain zebra lacks a dorsal stripe. In domestic horses, dun color and primitive markings exist in some animals across many breeds. The purpose of the bold black-and-white striping of zebras has been a subject of debate among biologists for over a century, but recent (2014) evidence supports the theory {{that they are a}} form of protection from biting flies. These insects appear to be less attracted to striped coats and, compared to other wild equines, zebras live in areas with the highest fly activity. With the exception of the domestic horses, which have long manes that lay over the neck and long tail hair growing {{from the top of the}} tailhead or dock, most equines have erect manes and long tails ending in a tuft of hair. The coats of some equine species undergo shedding <b>in</b> <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> of their range and are thick in the winter.|$|E
5|$|Extant wild equines have {{scattered}} ranges across Africa and Asia. The plains zebra {{lives in}} lush grasslands and savannas of Eastern and Southern Africa, while the Mountain zebra inhabits mountainous areas of southwest Africa. The other equine species tend to occupy more arid environments with more scattered vegetation. The Grévy's zebra {{is found in}} thorny scrubland of East Africa, while the African wild ass inhabits rocky deserts of North Africa. The two Asian wild ass species live in the dry deserts of the Near East and Central Asia and the Przwelski's wild horse's habitat is the deserts of Mongolia. Only {{the range of the}} plains and Grévy's zebras overlap. In addition to wild populations, domesticated horses and donkeys are widespread thanks to humans. <b>In</b> <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> of the world, populations of feral horses and feral donkeys exist, which are descended from domesticated animals that were released or escaped into the wild.|$|E
5|$|These {{birds are}} largely resident, and will only {{disperse}} beyond their range after mild winters. Carolina wrens sporadically breed {{as far north}} as Maine and Quebec after mild winters. <b>In</b> <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> of their range, such as most of Iowa, prolonged periods of snow can curtail potential expansion. Permanent breeding locations range from eastern Nebraska, southern Michigan, southeast Ontario and the New England states to Mexican states such as Coahuila, Nuevo León, San Luis Potosí and Tamaulipas and the Gulf Coast of the United States. Local occurrences with infrequent and likely breeding locations include southeast South Dakota, central Kansas, eastern Colorado, western Oklahoma and Texas as far as Maine and New Brunswick. There have been occasional vagrants spotted in Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.|$|E
