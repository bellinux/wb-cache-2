40|$|AbstractThe {{introduction}} of <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> should lower {{health care costs}} by reducing the price of drugs. The realization of this goal may, however, not be fully achieved: <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> may be underused or misused in comparison to prescription drugs {{because of a lack}} of ongoing postgraduate physician education. More importantly, there is little incentive to explore new indications for soon-to-be <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> and drugs that are already generic. The failure to explore new indications for soon-to-be and existing <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> may result in a missed opportunity to further reduce health care costs. Thus, the apparent savings resulting from the {{introduction of}} <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> may not be fully realized unless the government and other third-party payers take a more active role in postgraduate drug education and investigation...|$|R
40|$|Generic {{substitution}} {{has become}} a common practice. In Pakistan living standards are below average. Improving knowledge and perception about <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> will increase the generic substitution, and it will reduce cost of treatment. The aim of {{study was to determine}} the knowledge, perception and attitude of undergraduate students of Pakistan about <b>generic</b> <b>drugs.</b> A questionnaire comprising of questions regarding knowledge and perception about <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> and attitude towards generic substitution was distributed to 100 students. Mostly students knew about <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> and difference between generic and brand names. Their idea about cost of <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> wasn’t correct. Mostly students prefer doctor’s advice while buying or changing their brand. Students substituting their brand didn’t find any difference in efficacy of both drugs. Overall good knowledge and perception about <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> was found, and mostly students showed positive attitude towards drug substitution. However, few required additional information...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{implementation}} of Directive 2004 / 48 EC on the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights in Sweden there is today a possibility for pharmaceutical companies holding a patent to issue interim injunctions against a generic company {{on the grounds of}} an attempt or preparation to a pharmaceutical patent infringement. It has been shown that one of the earliest steps in which a generic company may infringe a pharmaceutical patent is to offer the <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> onto the market. However, since {{the implementation}} of the attempt and preparation rule in the Swedish Patent Act questions have been raised as to in what stage interim injunctions may be issued against an attempt or preparation to offer <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> onto the market made by generic companies. This thesis has therefore intent to investigate at what stage interim injunctions may be applied for against a generic company on the grounds of an attempt or preparation to offer <b>generic</b> <b>drugs.</b> In the thesis the writer argues that in order for an attempt or preparation to offer <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> to exist an overall assessment must be made of the particular situation and that there is no specific principles to follow in order to determine either an attempt or a preparation to offer <b>generic</b> <b>drugs.</b> However, some guidance might be brought from Danish case law in order to establish a preparation to offer <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> in Sweden. ...|$|R
40|$|A new and {{challenging}} scenario for drug analysis and registration has been gradually {{incorporated into the}} routine of the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (Ag Nacional de Vigil 2 ncia Sanit 1 ra - Anvisa) by the Brazilian pharmaceutical industry.

The sample analyzed is composed of 323 <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> registered in 2010. A survival model involving the most important parameters in the registration process was estimated.

40|$|I {{examine the}} {{importance}} of physicians in {{the process by which}} patients receive either trade-name or <b>generic</b> <b>drugs.</b> Using a dataset on physicians, their patients, and the multisource drugs prescribed, I find that almost all physicians prescribe both types of drugs to their patients, but some physicians are more likely to prescribe <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> while other physicians are more likely to prescribe trade-name drugs. Very little of the prescription decision can be explained by observable characteristics of individual patients, but all of the evidence indicates that physicians are indeed an important agent in determining whether patients receive either trade-name or <b>generic</b> <b>drugs.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|When an {{application}} is approved, the FDA adds the <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> to its Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations list and annotates {{the list to}} show equivalence between the reference-listed drug and the generic.

25|$|Ondansetron was {{the first}} 5-HT3 antagonist, {{developed}} by Glaxo around 1984. Its efficacy was first established in 1987, in animal models, and it was extensively studied over the following years.

As of 2008, ondansetron and granisetron are the only 5-HT3 antagonists available as a <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> in the United States.

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the perceptions of opinion-leaders, patients and their accompanying family members or carers about <b>generic</b> <b>drugs.</b> Three groups of participants were surveyed: (i) 50 customers while they were visiting commercial pharmacies located in São Paulo city, Brazil, (ii) 25 patients and 25 companions while they were waiting at the university outpatient clinic, and (iii) 50 healthcare opinion-leaders from government, hospitals, health plans, academia, and pharmaceutical companies. The questions explored socio-demographic characteristics and perceptions regarding value attributes of <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> compared to brand name drugs. Respondents had an average age of 52 years and 53 % were women. Respondents believed <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> to be cheaper than brand name drugs (97 %), and 31 % thought <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> to be less effective than brand name <b>drugs.</b> Also, <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> were perceived by 54 % of respondents to be as safe as brand name drugs and 74 % would prefer brand name drugs if there was no price difference. In conclusion, multiple factors may contribute to the decision to buy generic drugs; among these, perceived effectiveness, safety and price appear to be the most important factors...|$|R
