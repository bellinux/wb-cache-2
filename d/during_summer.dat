5|$|According to the plan, {{the type}} of {{consumption}} (i.e. whether agricultural, industrial and civil) will also be considered when setting energy prices. The subsidy plan will be implemented in proportion with geographical regions because warm regions consume more electricity <b>during</b> <b>summer</b> while cold regions consume more gas during winter. Finally, the time of consumption (i.e. during peak and off-peak hours) and the consumption demand (i.e. whether it is low or high) will be taken into consideration.|$|E
5|$|Daylight saving time (abbreviated DST), {{commonly}} referred to as daylight savings time in speech, and known as summer time in some countries, is the practice of advancing clocks <b>during</b> <b>summer</b> months so that evening daylight lasts longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times. Typically, regions that use daylight saving time adjust clocks forward one hour close to the start of spring and adjust them backward in the autumn to standard time.|$|E

This rejection affected Synge greatly and reinforced his determination to spend as much time as possible outside Ireland.|$|E

5|$|The {{atmospheric}} circulation {{is controlled by}} the two semi–permanent South Atlantic and South Pacific highs, and the Chaco Low. <b>During</b> <b>summer,</b> the interaction between the South Atlantic High and the Chaco Low brings northeasterly and easterly winds that carry moisture to the region, particularly in the northern parts. The movement of moist air into the region <b>during</b> <b>summer</b> results in very high precipitation. Most of the precipitation comes from the east since the Andes block most moisture from the Pacific Ocean. Southern parts of the region are influenced by cold fronts travelling northward. These cold fronts are responsible for producing precipitation <b>during</b> <b>summer.</b> For example, in Tucumán Province, cold fronts are responsible for 70% of the rainfall in that province. Furthermore, the intertropical convergence zone (or doldrums) reaches the region during the summer months, leading to enhanced precipitation. During the winter months, the intertropical convergence zone, the South Pacific, and the South Atlantic highs move northward while the Chaco Low weakens, all of which results in the suppression of rain during the winter. With the Andes blocking most rain bearing clouds from the Pacific Ocean, along with {{atmospheric circulation}} patterns unfavourable for rain, this results in a dry season during winter. The Chaco Low attracts air masses from the South Pacific High, creating a dry and cold wind, particularly during winter. At the highest altitudes, westerly winds from the Pacific Ocean can penetrate during the winter months, leading to snowstorms.|$|E

5|$|The {{variations}} {{between the}} AADT and the ASDT traffic volumes {{are attributed to}} the fact that the motorway carries certain tourist traffic from Hungary to the Croatian motorway network and ultimately to the Adriatic Sea. On average the motorway carries 15% increased volume of traffic <b>during</b> <b>summer</b> months. As the Hungarian M6 motorway is gradually extended towards the Croatian border and the A5 motorway's northern terminus, the number of tourists traveling along this route in summer months is increasing.|$|E
