5|$|The Yale Union Laundry Building {{was built}} to house a {{commercial}} laundry during an era, roughly 1900 to 1950, when many urban U.S. households sent out their laundry for cleaning rather than <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> home. Before {{the invention of the}} steam laundry machine in the mid-19thcentury, women did most domestic washing at home using simple machines such as scrub boards, wooden tubs, and clothes lines. Steam-driven washing machines, and equipment for starching, ironing, and related tasks made industrial laundries feasible {{by the turn of the}} century.|$|E
500|$|For Stampede, {{the members}} went to drummer Vinnie Paul's Texas home studio, for a {{recording}} process draped in a relaxed, pressure-free atmosphere, {{surrounded by the}} obligatory cocktails, good eats and familial brotherhood. [...] "We were <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> my house solely. We ate, drank and BBQed together, which made the brotherhood that happened, come through in the music," [...] Paul said. The band members lived in bungalows on the grounds and turned Paul's house into a studio. Drums were recorded downstairs and guitars were recorded upstairs, with video screens in each room so the members could see one another while tracking. [...] "It’s a broad, diverse album that covers rock, heavy metal and Southern rock ground. That is {{the main thing that}} I like about it: it’s not so focused on one thing," [...] Paul said. The high ceilings at the Paul home allowed {{for the creation of a}} big, booming sound. They also were able to work at their own natural pace. [...] "We slept there, so if one of us just came up with an idea, we could jump on it," [...] guitarist Tom Maxwell said.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, {{some weeks}} after her {{unsuccessful}} audition for Geena Gregory, Jones was contacted by Coronation Street bosses, who {{offered her a}} part of a new character. Jones took on the role of Karen Phillips (no relation to Mandy), making her first appearance on 21 June. The character, after marrying Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), took on his surname, and became Karen McDonald. Described as [...] "a bulldog in hoop earrings" [...] and a [...] "Victoria Beckham wannabe", the role garnered Jones public attention, with episodes involving feuds between her and rival Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) receiving millions of viewers; the episode featuring Karen and Steve's (second) wedding, ruined by Tracy Barlow's revelation that her daughter Amy Barlow was Steve's love child, received 16.3 million viewers. Jones also began modelling for men's magazines such as FHM and Loaded, saying: [...] "I was 21, and within three weeks of me joining Corrie I was in Barbados doing a bikini shoot [...] I was quite impressionable and I'd just say yes to everything because I wanted to keep my job. The press officer is saying: 'Do this and you'll be the new young funky sexy girl.' We were all <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> that time, but I realised quite quickly that I needed to concentrate on what I was doing".|$|E

60|$|You may suppose I {{was only}} trying to frighten him. I was doing nothing of the sort. Blame me, or approve of me, as you please, I was expressing the {{resolution}} which I had in my mind when I spoke. Whether my courage would have held out through the walk from Browndown to the rectory--whether I should have shrunk from it when I actually found myself in Lucilla's presence--is more than I can venture to decide. All I say is that I did, in my desperation, positively mean <b>doing</b> <b>it,</b> <b>at</b> the moment when I threatened to do it--and that Nugent Dubourg heard something in my voice which told him I was in earnest.|$|E
60|$|It is very {{plain that}} {{softening}} thus the hardship {{for the child}} of any act of obedience required of him by giving him a little time implies no abatement of {{the authority of the}} parent, nor does it detract at all from the implicitness of the obedience {{on the part of the}} child. The submission to authority is as complete in doing a thing in five minutes if the order was to do it in five minutes, as in <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> once if the order was to do it at once. And the mother must take great care, when thus trying to make obedience more easy by allowing time, that it should be prompt and absolute when the time has expired.|$|E

6000|$|I have {{a friend}} who was never a church member, but was, and is, a millionaire-a generous benevolent millionaire-who once went about doing good by stealth, but with a natural {{preference}} for <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> his office. One day he took it into his thoughtful noddle {{that he would like to}} assist in the erection of a new church edifice, to replace the inadequate and shabby structure in which a certain small congregation in his town then worshipped. So he drew up a subscription paper, modestly headed the list with [...] "Christian, 2000 dollars," [...] and started one of the Deacons about with it. In a few days the Deacon came back to him, like the dove to the ark, saying he had succeeded in procuring a few names, but the press of his private business was such that he had felt compelled to intrust the paper to Deacon Smith.|$|E
60|$|Caius Gracchus {{was nine}} years younger than his brother, and was elected tribune {{as soon as he}} was old enough. He was full of still greater schemes than his brother. His mother besought him to be warned by his brother's fate, but he was bent on his objects, and carried some of them out. He had the Sempronian law reaffirmed, though he could not act on it; but in the {{meantime}} he began a regular custom of having corn served out to the poorer citizens, and found work for them upon roads and bridges; also he caused the state to clothe the soldiers, instead of their <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> their own expense. Another scheme which he first proposed was to make the Italians of the countries now one with Roman territory into citizens, with votes like the Romans themselves; but this again angered the patricians, who saw they should be swamped by numbers and lose their power.|$|E
60|$|I am {{not going}} to set down rules here for book-keeping, or to teach the {{tradesman}} how to do it, but I am showing the necessity and usefulness of <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> all. That tradesman who keeps no books, may depend upon it he will ere long keep no trade, unless he resolves also to give no credit. He that gives no trust, and takes no trust, either by wholesale or by retail, and keeps his cash all himself, may indeed go on without keeping any books at all; and has nothing to do, when he would know his estate, but to cast up his shop and his cash, and see how much they amount to, and that is his whole and neat estate; for as he owes nothing, so nobody is in debt to him, and all his estate is in his shop; but I suppose the tradesman that trades wholly thus, is not yet born, or if there ever were any such, they are all dead.|$|E
