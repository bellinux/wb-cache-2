In her 2013 book, Sensational Devotion: Evangelical Performance in Twenty-First Century America, Jill Stevenson, {{an associate professor of}} theatre arts at Marymount Manhattan College, wrote that [...] "The Creation Museum prompts more questions from friends and colleagues {{than any of the other}} venues <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> in this book. It is not simply the museum's anti-evolution message that fascinates people. Even more compelling is how the Creation Museum actually conveys that message. By coupling the physical form of a traditional natural history museum with a radical community-based agenda, the Creation Museum empowers and gives public voice to a community that perceives itself as threatened, disenfranchised, and misrepresented by mainstream culture." ...|$|E

60|$|In Custom and Myth (p. 207), <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> {{the logic}} by which Dr. Hahn proves Tsuni-Goam to be 'The Red Dawn.'

But of tsu in the sense of 'red' he gives not one example, while he does give another word for 'red,' or 'bloody.'
