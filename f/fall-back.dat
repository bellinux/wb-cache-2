40|$|International audienceWe use our newly {{developed}} Dust Monte-Carlo (DMC) simulation technique (Crifo et al., 2005 a) {{to study the}} dynamics of dust grains {{in the vicinity of}} some of the benchmark aspherical, homogeneous cometary nuclei and of the benchmark spherical, inhomogeneous nuclei studied by us precedingly. We use the interim unrealistic simplifying assumptions of grain sphericity, negligible nucleus rotation rate, and negligible tidal force, but take accurately into account the nucleus gravitational force, gas coma aerodynamic force, and solar radiation pressure force, and consider the full mass range of ejectable spherical grains. The resulting complicated grain motions are described in detail, as well as the resulting complicated and often counter-intuitive dust coma structure. The results are used to answer several important questions: (1) When computing coma dust distributions, (a) is it acceptable to take into consideration only {{one or two of the}} above mentioned forces (as currently done) ? (b) to which accuracy must these forces be known, in particular is it acceptable to represent the gravity of an aspherical nucleus by a spherically symmetric gravity? (c) how do the more efficient but less general Dust Multi-Fluid (DMF) computations compare with the DMC results? (2) Are there simple structural relationships between the dust coma of a nucleus at small heliocentric distance, and that of the same nucleus at large ? (3) Are there similarities between the gas coma structures and the associated dust coma structures?

40|$|Purpose (Hypothesis) – Framed by {{graduate}} talent management, {{the purpose}} of this paper was to construct a conceptual model and framework ‘Talent Evolution - Who has Control?’, figure 1. This paper initials a rationale research question worthy of further study, recognising the current trends and the complexity of the employer-graduate exchange regarding graduate management. The stock market crash of 2008 (recent recession) has radically shifted the concepts of McKinsey’s War for Talent to a new vantage point, with scarring implications such as unemployment, underemployment, and aggressive upskilling, leading graduates to practice career resilience- an individualist and consumerist approach to gain employment. Rather than simply classifying employability and accessing graduate talent as a stationary and ridged procedure, theory of talent evolution argues that employability is an indefinite and heuristic process of obtaining meaningful and challenging work. Ultimately embodying career resilience practices, a constant shift between career-efficiency and self-efficiency, superior to institutional and entry-level employability. But the underlying principle of this evolutionary process is- ‘who has control?’. in other words, ‘who has control over managing talent? Who defines and controls employability? Is it the employer or the graduate?’ Design/methodology/approach –Talent evolution, as a conceptual model, was comprised of a theory building process, using three sets of semi-structured focus groups within a collective engineering student body, against contextual data and conventional employability theories. By applying a thematic analysis of some core themes that have emerged from academic literature such as but not limited to; Makki, Salleh, Memon, and Harum (2015), Shaw and Fairhurst (2008), Garavan (2007) and Bedingfield (2005), Knight and Yorke (2003), and Chambers, Foulon Handfield-Jones, Hankin, and Michaels III, E (1998) War for Talent report ‘talent evolution’, figure 1. Emerging themes from contextual data was inspected to demonstrate talent evolution as a testable hypothesis within an inductive philosophical framework. These emerging themes, such as employability, work readiness, talent management and career-self-efficiency, were implemented within the data collection process and analysis, table 1, Braun and Clarke (2006). The primary data consisted of three sets of in-depth focus group interviews of third-level undergraduate and post-graduate engineering students located in Dublin, Ireland. In addition, the collection of data was examined qualitatively, and Saldaña, J. (2015), Matusovich, Streveler and Miller (2010), and Eisenhardt and Graebner (2007) research was used as a template to design the conceptual model of ‘Talent Evolution - Who has Control?’ as illustrated in figure 1. Incorporating a qualitative investigation and inductive reasoning, the engineering students, as the population sample, procured an enlightened enquiry into the concepts of talent management and employability, from a post-structuralist, interpretivism perspective. Findings – This paper illustrates an in-depth profile of millennial third level engineering students, signifying the complexity of a student’s employability and position within the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematic (STEM) labour markets, and the organisational graduate management systems. Advancing from Makki et al., (2015) and Dacre-Pool, Sewell, and Sewell (2007) and Knight and Yorke (2003) theoretical frameworks, this qualitative investigation reviewed, from the perspectives of third-level students, has positioned the capability of a graduate’s employability within the highly volatile and complex knowledge economy and workplace environment. Specific characteristics such as millennial individual’s identity, learning styles, employability engagement, previous experiences, and expectations within the employer-graduate exchange was critically analysed and charted within existing theoretical and contextual data. Thus, illustrating the ambiguity of current management schemes, Human Resource Management strategies (HRM) and Strategic Human Resource Management (SHRM) towards graduate talent development. Therefore, adapting to employability, within the employer-graduate exchange is not a statement, but an organic and indefinite process, that is dependent upon an individual’s career exploration practices, such as ‘future vision’ or ‘career tasters’ and perspectives of the labour market and the employer-graduate exchange, demonstrating the importance of ‘corporate fit’ or ‘personal fit’. An individual’s experiences form the conceptual framework of talent evolution, a constant pursuit of obtaining challenging and meaningful work, engaging in career resilience, work readiness, boundary-less careers, life-long learning, and career-self efficiency. While at the same time, acknowledging that the individual is responsible for their own development or <b>fall-backs</b> in obtaining career-self efficiency. Research limitations/implications –The findings and logical analysis of this paper is a radical shift from the confinements of War for Talent, and conventional organisational career models. This paper is a qualitative and thematic analysis paper, that can be tested within mainstream inductive and deductive conceptual frameworks regarding key themes and topics of employability, work readiness, graduate resourcing, and graduate development. However, the series of semi-structured focus groups of third level engineers was conducted within a short space of time, capturing the transitory and intrinsic perspectives of an engineering student’s perceptions and expectations of employability and talent within a restricted career map and limited workplace experience. This unfortunately illustrates the preliminary effects of talent evolution. Conclusions based on this paper is limited to evidence procured within the scope of the working sample. Most notably, only five women were included in this study, which is relative the participation levels within the collective student body and the engineering degree of a third-level institution located in Dublin. Therefore, by examining the assumed relativity of these engineers, against theoretical and contextual data, elevated the suitability of talent evolution, expanding the academic, conceptual, and thematic models of employability and graduate talent management. Further in-depth longitudinal and quantitative studies, relating to third-level students as the new theorists of employability, is necessary to transfer talent evolution within various geographical points, adapting the proposed conceptual model to various academic disciplines. Either at a national and international scale, analysing the structural and interpretative frameworks of ‘what defines employability?’ is necessary to determine if the theory of ‘Talent Evolution-Who has Control?’ is an effective theoretical and practical model, addressing the underlying issues related to managing an intergenerational workforce. In addition, this further research within various geographical and academic spectrums is crucial to prove that talent evolution is not solely confined within this paper working sample, third-level engineering students or in Dublin, Ireland. Practical implications – There is an assumption that individuals must conform to the ideal of career efficiency, and must religiously exercise in theoretical models of employability. These theoretical models, such as Dacre Pool et al., (2007) ‘Key of employability’, Knight and Yorke (2004) USEM model, and Law and Watts (1977) DOTS model are governed by the principles of generic organisational and firm specific SHRM perspectives. Realistically, talent from an organisational perspective, are exclusively chosen groups of individuals that receive access to opportunities that enhance their careers, as graduates are perceived as precious assets to an organisation, illustrating strategic effectiveness to high performance and profitability, Cabellero and Walker (2010), Garavan (2007) and Bedingfield (2005). This paper proposes that third level students/graduates are the new theorists of employability, regaining control of their idiocentric career exploration and talent development. Collectively, third-level students have regained control over the employer-employee exchange, compelling employers, and corporations to mitigate their scientific and mass production talent strategies to a new forum. The recent recession has resulted in graduates’ adopting an entrepreneurial and consumerist approach to job seeking activities, and embodying a new trend of voluntary resignations, causing a challenge in corporate SHRM and ROI tactics. Talent evolution recognises the need for corporations to treat graduates as individuals with various interpretations and engagements of employability. The practical implications of this paper are to refocus the employers theoretical and idealistic models of employability, using the graduate millennials as the new key to stabilise labour market demands and talent supply. Suggesting that third-level student’s understandings and engagements of employability controls the supply-demand equilibrium within the labour market. Talent evolution, as a conceptual model, is an organic process, acknowledging that millennial graduates are on a quest to obtain challenging and meaningful work. Therefore, rather than orchestrate a linear process, talent evolution allows ‘free’ career management and individuals indefinite process in obtaining career-self efficiency as the new frame of reference, accepting employability a life-experiences of career exploration and talent development. Originality/value – The main contribution of this paper is to refocus the individual’s adaptive nature to the economic, technological, demographic trends and the uncertainty of the unregulated market. Individuals, such third level engineers must to manage their own careers freely, regaining control regarding employability and talent management capabilities, incorporating ‘talent evolution’ within a graduate’s workplace learning and academic-skill development. This has altered the prospective workplace performance, subconsciously altering employer’s perceptions of graduate development schemes, employer expectations and designing and procuring employability-based relationships, enhancing the prospects of self-efficiency and idiocentric career exploration...|$|R

5|$|On {{the extreme}} {{south of the}} Grebbe Line, the Grebbeberg, the Germans were now {{deploying}} three SS battalions including support troops and three fresh infantry battalions of IR.322; two of IR.374 laid in immediate reserve. During the evening and night of 12–13 May the Dutch had assembled in this sector about a dozen battalions. These forces consisted of the reserve battalions of several army corps, divisions and brigades, and the independent Brigade B, which had been freed when the Main Defence Line in the Land van Maas en Waal had been abandoned {{as part of the}} withdrawal of III Army Corps from North Brabant. However, not all of these units would be concentrated into a single effort for a counterattack to retake the main line. Some battalions had been fed immediately into the battle at the Stop Line and others were kept in reserve, mainly behind the <b>fall-back</b> line near the Rhenen railroad. Furthermore, most battalions were a quarter below strength. Four were to be used, under command of Brigade B, for the flanking attack from the north. This attack was delayed for several hours; when it finally started late in the morning of 13 May, it ran right into a comparable advance by two battalions of Der Fuehrer. This brigade, unaware of Dutch intentions, had shifted its attack axis to the north to roll up the Grebbe Line from behind. A confused encounter battle followed in which the vanguard of the Dutch troops, poorly supported by their artillery, began to give way at around 12:30 to the encroaching SS troops. Soon this resulted in a general withdrawal of the brigade, which turned into a rout when, at about 13:30, the Grebbeberg area was bombed by 27 Ju 87 Stukas.|$|E

Chard consented and by 4pm the hastily constructed perimeter was complete. Soon afterwards, the Zulu impi, which contained some 3,000–4,000 men, was sighted advancing on their position. This caused the NNC troops to panic and desert the station, reducing the number of defenders from around 350 to approximately 140 (including 30 sick and wounded).

[...] Their robust jaws and specialized teeth suggest a diet of hard objects, such as nuts and seeds, yet other evidence, including fecal pellets, suggests they may have had a more varied diet, including leaves, fruit, and animal matter (omnivory). [...] Dental wear analysis has shed some light on this dietary mystery, suggesting that monkey lemurs had a more eclectic diet, while using tough seeds as a <b>fall-back</b> food item. [...] Within the family, the genus Archaeolemur was the most widespread in distribution, resulting in hundreds of subfossil specimens, and may have been one of the last subfossil lemurs to die out.|$|E
500|$|The Allied 'congress' {{met again}} {{in the spring of}} 480 BC and agreed to defend the narrow Vale of Tempe on the borders of Thessaly and block Xerxes's advance. However, once there, they were warned by Alexander I of Macedon that the vale could be {{bypassed}} and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelmingly large, thus the Greeks retreated. Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont. At this point, a second strategy was [...] suggested by Themistocles to the allies. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) would require the army of Xerxes to travel through the narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual strategy was adopted by the congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made <b>fall-back</b> plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, while the women and children of Athens were evacuated to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E
500|$|Facing {{the major}} Russian offensive, the II Brigade of the Polish Legions was {{deployed}} out of Kostiuchnówka, at Gruziatyn and Hołzula. The I Brigade held the lines advancing down the Polish Hill, Kostiuchnówka village; the III Brigade, positioned to its left, held the lines near the Optowa village; the Piłsudski's Redoubt {{was the most}} advanced Polish position, just about [...] facing head on the most advanced Russian redoubt, called the [...] "Eagle's Nest". Further down the Polish Hill the Hungarian 128th Honvédség Brigade took positions opposite the Polish right flank, the Hungarian 11th Cavalry Division opposite the left flank. Two Polish <b>fall-back</b> lines were drawn beyond {{the first line of}} defense: one drawn through the Polish Forest and the Engineer's Forest, and the second one through the villages of Nowe Kukle, Nowy Jastków, the camp of Legionowo and Nowa Rarańcza. The Polish Legions at Kostiuchnówka numbered from 5,500 to 7,300 (6,500 infantry and 800 cavalry), with forty-nine machine guns, fifteen mortars and twenty-six artillery units. The Russian forces, composed of the most part of the 46th Corps (primarily the 110th and 77nd Infantry Division), numbered 23,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry and were backed up by a larger artillery force consisting of 120 units.|$|E
