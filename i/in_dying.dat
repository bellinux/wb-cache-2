5|$|The admirals, however, were {{reckoning}} {{without their}} sailors. The enlisted {{men of the}} High Seas Fleet, aware that Germany had lost the war, had no interest <b>in</b> <b>dying</b> {{for the sake of}} the Navy's honor. When the details of Plan 19 were leaked to the fleet, a mutiny almost instantly broke out, with sailors raising the red flag of revolution and refusing to obey their officers. Faced with a complete breakdown of discipline within his fleet, Admiral Hipper had no choice but to disperse his ships to their homeports in early November. Days later, on 11 November 1918, World War I came to an end.|$|E

25|$|Long {{after her}} death, Marie Antoinette remains a major {{historical}} figure linked with conservatism, the Catholic Church, wealth, and fashion. She {{has been the}} subject of a number of books, films and other media. Politically engaged authors have deemed her the quintessential representative of class conflict, western aristocracy and absolutism. Some of her contemporaries, such as Jefferson, attributed to her the start of the French Revolution. For others, Marie Antoinette was a victim of her family's ambition and the general situation in France.

25|$|There is {{disagreement}} among American physicians as {{to whether}} the non-maleficence principle excludes the practice of euthanasia. Euthanasia is currently legal in the states of Washington DC, California, Colorado, Oregon, Vermont and Washington. Around the world there are different organizations that campaign to change legislation about the issue of physician assisted death, or PAD. Examples of such organizations are the Hemlock Society of the United States and the Dignity <b>in</b> <b>Dying</b> campaign in the United Kingdom. These groups believe that doctors should be given the right to end a patient’s life only if the patient is conscious enough to decide for themselves, is knowledgeable about the possibility of alternative care, and has willingly asked to end their life or requested access to the means to do so.|$|E

A questionnaire, {{consisting}} of various biographical items and a number of measuring instruments was used to determine whether a difference in management style between organizations {{in the public}} and private sector exists.

No statistically significant difference was found in people orientation in the two sectors. Managers in the private sector however, were inclined to be more authoritarian. To the degree that this phenomenon manifests itself in managerial style, a difference in the management styles of managers in the public and private sectors does exist.
