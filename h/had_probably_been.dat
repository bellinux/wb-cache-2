5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the modern Pawnee people were not a single unified tribe. At {{the middle of the}} 18th century, they consisted of two major groups. The Skidis, or Wolf Pawnees, had migrated northward with the Arikaras, and <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> in Nebraska since 1600 or earlier. By the beginning of the 18th century, they were established on the Loup River, which flows through central Nebraska into the Platte River from the north.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{deteriorated}} {{during this}} period. The masonry {{of the castle}} <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> stripped for use as local building materials, as this part of England was traditionally very short of suitable stone. Edward VI gave the castle to Sir John Checke, until it reverted to Mary I. After Mary, the castle was acquired by Sir Gervase Elwes, whose family retained it until the 19th century. At some point after 1720, the surviving east and south sides of the inner bailey walls were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was last}} {{referred}} to in active use in 1316, after which it was probably allowed to decay; further stonework {{was taken by the}} keeper of Rockingham Forest in 1373, by which time the castle <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> abandoned. By the 15th century, Sauvey formed a subsidiary property of Withcote manor - a reversal of the old land holding pattern. Its structures had mostly been dismantled or destroyed by 1622 and had gone entirely {{by the end of the}} century.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} part of Northumbria, and perhaps the whole kingdom, <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> ruled by Ealdred son of Eadulf since 913. Faced with Ragnall's invasion, Ealdred came north seeking assistance from Constantine. The two advanced south to face Ragnall, and {{this led to a}} battle somewhere {{on the banks of the}} River Tyne, probably at Corbridge where Dere Street crosses the river. The Battle of Corbridge appears to have been indecisive; the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba is alone in giving Constantine the victory.|$|E
5|$|A {{forensic}} {{examination of}} Docherty's body indicated she <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> suffocated, {{but it could}} not be proven. Although the police suspected the men of other murders, there was no evidence on which they could take action. An offer was put to Hare granting immunity from prosecution if he turned king's evidence. He provided the details of Docherty's murder and confessed to all 16 deaths; formal charges were made against Burke and his wife for three murders. At the subsequent trial Burke was found guilty of one murder and sentenced to death. The case against his wife was found not proven—a Scottish legal verdict to acquit an individual but not declare them innocent. Burke was hanged shortly afterwards, his corpse was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the Anatomical Museum of Edinburgh Medical School where, as of 2017, it remains.|$|E
5|$|A {{report by}} Baldassare Ceola, the police {{commissioner}} of Palermo, {{concluded that the}} crime <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> carried out by Mafiosi Carlo Costantino and Antonino Passananti under Cascioferro's direction. Evidence was thin, however, and the case was effectively closed when in July 1911 the Palermo Court of Appeals discharged Cascioferro, as well as Costantino and Passananti, due to insufficient evidence {{to send them to}} trial. Petrosino's murder was never solved. Nevertheless, Costantino and Passananti were identified as the most likely assassins. Costantino died in the late 1930s and Passananti, in March 1969. In 2014, more than a century after the assassination, the Italian police overheard a tapped phone conversation in which a sibling claimed that Paolo Palazzotto had been the killer on the orders of Cascioferro. Palazzotto had been arrested after the shooting, but had been released for lack of evidence.|$|E

5|$|Born in 1541, {{in either}} the village of Fodele or Candia (the Venetian name of Chandax, present day Heraklion) on Crete, El Greco was descended from a prosperous urban family, which <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> driven out of Chania to Candia after an {{uprising}} against the Catholic Venetians between 1526 and 1528. El Greco's father, Geórgios Theotokópoulos (d. 1556), was a merchant and tax collector. Nothing is known about his mother or his first wife, also Greek. El Greco's older brother, Manoússos Theotokópoulos (1531– 13 December 1604), was a wealthy merchant and spent {{the last years of}} his life (1603–1604) in El Greco's Toledo home.|$|E
5|$|In November 2012 it was {{revealed}} that EA 32751 (Gebelein Man) <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> murdered. A CAT scan of the mummified body taken at the Cromwell Hospital in London showed that Gebelein Man had been aged about 18 to 20 {{at the time of his}} death and had been well muscled. Under his left shoulder blade the scan revealed a puncture to the body; the murder weapon had been used with such force that it had slightly damaged the shoulder blade but had shattered the rib beneath it and penetrated the lung. It was believed that the injury had been caused by a copper blade or flint knife at least 12cm in length and 2cm wide. Daniel Antoine, the British Museum's expert on human remains, believes that Gebelein Man had been taken by surprise by the attack as there were no defense wounds.|$|E
5|$|On 14 March 1772, amid various {{political}} machinations, Count Hieronymus von Colloredo {{was elected to}} the archbishopric as a compromise candidate acceptable to the imperial court in Vienna. Although unpopular among Salzburgers, this appointment appeared at first to be to the Mozarts' advantage: Leopold's withheld salary was paid, and on 31 August Colloredo authorised the payment of Wolfgang's Konzertmeister salary. However, the new archbishop began to look for someone outside the Salzburg court to be his new Kapellmeister. Eventually, he chose the Italian Domenico Fischietti, who was several years younger than Leopold. Realising that his chances of promotion <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> irrevocably lost, Leopold turned his hopes for a comfortable old age towards Wolfgang, giving new urgency to the third Italian journey which began in October 1772.|$|E

5|$|In 1161, Edward the Confessor {{was made}} a saint, and objects {{connected}} with his reign became holy relics. The monks at his burial place of Westminster Abbey claimed that Edward had asked them to look after his regalia in perpetuity {{and that they were}} to be used at the coronations of all future kings. A note to this effect is contained in an inventory of relics drawn up by Richard Sporley, a monk at the abbey in 1450, recording a tunicle, dalmatic, pallium, and other vestments; a gold sceptre, two rods, a gold crown, comb, and spoon; for the queen's coronation a crown and two rods; and for the holy communion a chalice of onyx stone and a paten made of gold– all of which were to be considered precious relics. Although the claim is likely to have been an exercise in self-promotion on the abbey's part, and some of the regalia <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> taken from Edward's grave when he was reinterred there, it became accepted as fact, thereby establishing the first known set of hereditary coronation regalia in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the final Japanese assault on the knoll, 292 dead Japanese were counted around 'B' Company's perimeter. In total, {{over the course of}} the battle, the Australians counted 620 Japanese killed, and {{estimated}} that another 1,000 <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> wounded. Information obtained from captured Japanese clarified that the Australians had come up against a force of at least 2,400 troops. The commander of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Kawano Koji, was among the dead, as was a senior divisional staff officer, Lieutenant Colonel Honda Matsuo. Four wounded Japanese were also taken prisoner of war. Casualties for the Australians included 10 officers and 179 other ranks killed or wounded, while there had been a further 81 Australians evacuated due to non-combat related issues. Wartime Japanese casualty estimates vary from these figures, though, claiming to have killed 1,800 Australians, while placing their own losses at 280 killed and 320 wounded. Long argues that these figures are problematic, as based upon the same report, the Japanese believed that there were only 400 Australians in the region during the battle, and yet they claimed to have killed almost five times that number.|$|E
5|$|The Maya sculptural {{tradition}} {{that produced the}} stelae emerged fully formed and <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> preceded by sculpted wooden monuments. However the tradition of raising stelae had its origin elsewhere in Mesoamerica, among the Olmecs of the Gulf Coast of Mexico. In the Late Preclassic it then spread into the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and southwards along the Pacific Coast to sites such as Chiapa de Corzo, Izapa and Takalik Abaj where Mesoamerican Long Count calendar dates began to be carved onto the stelae. Although at Izapa the stelae depicted mythological scenes, at Takalik Abaj they began to show rulers in Early Classic Maya posture accompanied by calendrical dates and hieroglyphic texts. It was also at Takalik Abaj and Izapa that these stelae began to be paired with circular altars. By approximately 400BC, {{near the end of}} the Middle Preclassic Period, early Maya rulers were raising stelae that celebrated their achievements and validated their right to rule. At ElPortón in the Salamá Valley of highland Guatemala a carved schist stela (Monument1) was erected, the badly eroded hieroglyphs appear to be a very early form of Maya writing and may even be the earliest known example of Maya script. It was associated with a plain altar in a typical stela-altar pairing that would become common across the Maya area. Stela 11 from Kaminaljuyu, a major Preclassic highland city, dates to the Middle Preclassic and is the earliest stela to depict a standing ruler. The sculpted Preclassic stelae from Kaminaljuyu and other cities in the region, such as Chalchuapa in ElSalvador and Chocolá in the Pacific lowlands, tend to depict political succession, sacrifice and warfare.|$|E

5|$|The {{fighting}} {{had been}} costly for both sides. Australian casualties included nine killed and 28 wounded, while one howitzer and two mortars had been damaged. North Vietnamese casualties included 52 dead, who lay strewn around the perimeter, while 23 small arms and seven crew-served weapons {{had also been}} captured by the Australians. While Radio Hanoi quickly announced a major North Vietnamese victory there was {{little doubt that the}} Australians had convincingly repulsed the attack, even if they had come close to suffering a military and political catastrophe, with the task force headquarters itself nearly being destroyed. The initial delays during the fly-in had left the defenders spread haphazardly and, had the North Vietnamese assaulted without the preparatory fire that ultimately alerted the Australians, the result may have been different. Equally, the fortunes of war had resulted in the Australian guns being laid {{in the direction of the}} main North Vietnamese assault, and the firepower they afforded <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> decisive. The occupation of FSB Coral was one of the first such operations conducted by 1 ATF and many of the deficiencies evident had been due to this inexperience. Command and control had been insufficient and in hindsight the lack of co-ordination in setting up the defence could have been avoided with the appointment of a local defence commander. The absence of proper aerial reconnaissance prior to insertion had also resulted in units and their supporting elements landing on unsuitable ground in full view of the North Vietnamese, while the delay in the insertion of the second battalion denied them enough time to establish their positions before night fell. Failures in the assessment and timely distribution of intelligence were also identified.|$|E
