5|$|Modern radar scans many angles {{around the}} site. Reflectivity values at {{multiple}} angles {{above ground level}} in a storm are proportional to the precipitation rate at those levels. Summing reflectivities in the Vertically Integrated Liquid or VIL, gives the liquid water content in the cloud. Research shows that hail development in the upper levels of the storm {{is related to the}} evolution of VIL. VIL divided by the vertical extent of the storm, called VIL density, has a relationship with hail size, although this varies with atmospheric conditions and therefore is not highly accurate. Traditionally, hail size and probability can be estimated from radar data by computer using algorithms based on this research. Some algorithms include the height of the <b>freezing</b> <b>level</b> to estimate the melting of the hailstone and what would be left on the ground.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{concentrated}} charge {{within the}} cloud must exceed the insulating properties of air, and this increases proportionally to {{the distance between}} the cloud and the ground, the proportion of CG strikes (versus cloud-to-cloud (CC) or in-cloud (IC) discharges) becomes greater when the cloud is closer to the ground. In the tropics, where the <b>freezing</b> <b>level</b> is generally higher in the atmosphere, only 10% of lightning flashes are CG. At the latitude of Norway (around 60° North latitude), where the freezing elevation is lower, 50% of lightning is CG.|$|E
40|$|Because {{of the use}} of {{radiation}} in cancer therapy, the risk of nuclear contamination from power plants, military conflicts, and terrorism, there is a compelling scientific and public health interest in the effects of environmental radiation exposure on brain function, in particular hippocampal function and learning and memory. Previous studies have emphasized changes in learning and memory following radiation exposure. These approaches have ignored the question of how radiation exposure might impact recently acquired memories, which might be acquired under traumatic circumstances (cancer treatment, nuclear disaster, etc.). To address the question of how radiation exposure might affect the processing and recall of recently acquired memories, we employed a fear-conditioning paradigm wherein animals were trained, and subsequently irradiated (whole-body X-ray irradiation 24 hours later. Animals were given two weeks to recover, and were tested for retention and extinction of hippocampus-dependent contextual fear conditioning. Exposure to irradiation following training was associated with reduced daily increases in body weights over the 22 days of the study and resulted in greater <b>freezing</b> <b>levels</b> and aberrant extinction 2 weeks later. This was also observed when the intensity of the training protocol was increased. Cued <b>freezing</b> <b>levels</b> and measures of anxiety 2 weeks after training were also higher in irradiated than sham-irradiated mice. In contrast to contextual <b>freezing</b> <b>levels,</b> cued <b>freezing</b> <b>levels</b> were even higher in irradiated mice receiving 5 shocks during training than sham-irradiated mice receiving 10 shocks during training.

25|$|However, the reflectivities {{are greatly}} {{enhanced}} by hail and VIL is greatly overestimating the rain potential in presence of hail.

25|$|What {{is needed}} is a {{knowledge}} of the water content in the thunderstorm, the <b>freezing</b> <b>level</b> and the height of the summit of the precipitation. One way of calculating the water content is to transform the reflectivities in rain rate at all levels in the clouds and to sum it up. This is done by an algorithm called Vertically integrated liquid, or VIL. This value represent the total amount of liquid water in the cloud that is available. If the cloud would rain out completely, it would be the amount of rain falling on the ground and one can estimate with VIL the potential for flash flood.|$|E

40|$|Jeffrey B. RosenThe medial {{prefrontal cortex}} (mPFC) has {{previously}} been shown to play various roles in different phases of fear-learning and memory, particularly in extinction. While there has been substantial progress in understanding how the mPFC regulates fear to discrete cues (e. g., tones and lights), less {{is known about the}} mPFC’s involvement in learning fear to a context. Therefore, this study examined the effects of mPFC inhibition during the acquisition phase of contextual fear conditioning on the long-term retention and extinction of contextual fear. Twenty-four rats received bilateral infusions of a pan-cellular optogenetic neural silencer CAG-ArchT-EGFP (ArchT, n= 12) or a CAG-EGFP (control, n= 12) virus. Three weeks later, optic fiber assemblies (OFAs) were bilaterally implanted over the injection site. After an additional week of recovery, rats were conditioned using a contextual fear conditioning paradigm administering 5 shocks, each 3 minutes apart on day one and tested for freezing to the context-alone on days two and three. The mPFC was optogenetically inhibited on day one during contextual fear acquisition. Optogenetic inhibition of mPFC during the acquisition phase of contextual fear conditioning (Day 1) did not significantly affect the increases in freezing to the context or the rate of acquisition. The control rats showed significantly decreased <b>freezing</b> <b>levels</b> compared to the sustained increased <b>freezing</b> <b>levels</b> of the ArchT rats during day 2 of the extinction retention test. On the second extinction retention test, there was a similar trend in decreased freezing of the control rats. In an alternate context, rats were subsequently reconditioned and extinction tested. ArchT rats showed significantly higher <b>freezing</b> <b>levels</b> before shocks began, but showed no significantly different training and extinction testing behavior compared to controls, indicating that optogenetic silencing did not cause permanent inhibition to the mPFC. These data suggest that inhibition of the mPFC activity during acquisition interferes with later extinction and facilitates fear generalization to a novel context. Neuroscienc...|$|R

500|$|Stratiform (a broad {{shield of}} {{precipitation}} {{with a relatively}} similar intensity) and dynamic precipitation (convective precipitation which is showery in nature with large changes in intensity over short distances) occur {{as a consequence of}} slow ascent of air in synoptic systems (on the order of cm/s), such as in the vicinity of cold fronts and near and poleward of surface warm fronts. Similar ascent is seen around tropical cyclones outside of the eyewall, and in comma-head precipitation patterns around mid-latitude cyclones. A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas. What separates rainfall from other precipitation types, such as ice pellets and snow, is the presence of a thick layer of air aloft which is above the melting point of water, which melts the frozen precipitation well before it reaches the ground. If there is a shallow near surface layer that is below freezing, freezing rain (rain which freezes on contact with surfaces in subfreezing environments) will result.

50|$|Hail {{forms in}} strong {{thunderstorm}} clouds, particularly those with intense updrafts, high liquid water content, great vertical extent, large water droplets, {{and where a}} good portion of the cloud layer is below freezing 0 C. Hail-producing clouds are often identifiable by their green coloration. The growth rate is maximized at about -13 C, and becomes vanishingly small much below -30 C as supercooled water droplets become rare. For this reason, hail is most common within continental interiors of the mid-latitudes, as hail formation is considerably more likely when the <b>freezing</b> <b>level</b> is below the altitude of 11000 ft. Entrainment of dry air into strong thunderstorms over continents can increase the frequency of hail by promoting evaporational cooling which lowers the <b>freezing</b> <b>level</b> of thunderstorm clouds giving hail a larger volume to grow in.

Three sensitivity experiments were applied to two composites of 15 convective and 15 frontal stratiform intense precipitation events observed in a coastal midlatitude region (Belgium), which were evaluated against satellite-retrieved cloud properties and radar-rain-gauge derived surface precipitation. It is found that the cloud optical thickness distribution was well captured by all experiments, although a significant underestimation of cloudiness occurred in the convective composite. The cloud-top-pressure distribution was improved most by more realistic snow size distributions (including a temperature-dependent intercept parameter and non-spherical snow for the calculation of the slope parameter), due to increased snow depositional growth at high altitudes.
