This work sought to reaggregate the components of official <b>gross</b> <b>output</b> measures rigorously, to approximate Marxian categories, using some new techniques, including input-output measures of direct and indirect labor, and capacity utilization adjustments. Shaikh and Tonak argued that the falling rate of profit is not a short-term trend of the business cycle, but a long-term historical trend.

25|$|The {{paradox of}} thrift (or paradox of saving) is a paradox of economics. The paradox states that an {{increase}} in autonomous saving leads to a decrease in aggregate demand and thus a decrease in <b>gross</b> <b>output</b> which will in turn lower total saving. The paradox is, narrowly speaking, that total saving may fall because of individuals' attempts to increase their saving, and, broadly speaking, that increase in saving may be harmful to an economy. Both the narrow and broad claims are paradoxical within the assumption underlying the fallacy of composition, namely that what {{is true of the}} parts must be true of the whole. The narrow claim transparently contradicts this assumption, and the broad one does so by implication, because while individual thrift is generally averred to be good for the economy, the paradox of thrift holds that collective thrift may be bad for the economy.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{designers of}} gross product accounts (such as Simon Kuznets, Colin Clark, Edward Fulton Denison and Richard Stone) aimed precisely to exclude any capital gains (or other income from asset transactions and revaluations) from their measure of <b>gross</b> <b>output,</b> just like transfer payments. They wanted a reliable standard {{measure that would}} indicate changes {{in the value of}} the net new addition to wealth per year or per quarter: roughly, the total sales revenue from production less intermediate costs, or, the value of total outputs produced less the value of goods and services used up to produce them, or, the sum of factor incomes directly generated by production. The issue then is, how exactly the grossing and netting must be done to obtain the value of total output, and it is done in a different way than business itself would do it (to eliminate non-production income/expenditure, ensure uniform valuation, and remove double counting; from the point of view of national accounts, in fact real credits can become theoretical debits, and real debits can become theoretical credits).|$|E

40|$|Aggregation, as {{it applies}} to {{input-output}} analysis, is the process of grouping industries of an interindustry model into sectors so as to produce an intersectoral model, which is more manageable in that its dimensions are smaller than those of the original model. A problem which arises as a result of aggregation is that, in general, forecasts of sector <b>gross</b> <b>outputs,</b> obtained from the intersectoral model, differ from those obtained by aggregating forecasts of industry <b>gross</b> <b>outputs</b> produced by the original interindustry model. This phenomenon is known as aggregation bias. When {{there is a need to}} condense an input-output model into one of smaller dimensions, it is desirable that the resulting intersectoral model is subject to the smallest possible degree of aggregation bias. The researcher may also wish to place constraints upon the intersectoral model to ensure that certain industries are, or are not, aggregated into the same sector. Although there is a substantial body of theory which specifies the conditions under which the intersectoral model is not subject to aggregation bias, the extent to which various industry groupings satisfy these conditions is difficult to assess subjectively. Therefore, a formalised procedure, which groups industries into sectors so that aggregation bias is minimized, and which allows the imposition of constraints upon the intersectoral model, is a useful aid to the input-output analyst. Such a procedure is developed in this thesis and is applied to the most recent interindustry model of the New Zealand economy...|$|R
