This non-fiction book was intended to verify Stowe's claims about slavery. However, later research indicated that Stowe did not read many of the book's cited works until after she had published her novel.|$|E

5|$|By 1975, {{plans were}} laid {{to replace the}} Hunter in the air-to-air role with a more modern fighter aircraft, the Northrop F-5E Tiger II. The Hunter {{remained}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> role within the Swiss Air Force; like the RAF's Hunter fleet, the type transitioned to become the country's primary ground attack platform, replacing the Venom. While the Swiss Hunters already had more armament options than the RAF aircraft, being cleared to carry Oerlikon 80mm rockets instead of the elderly 3-inch rockets used by the RAF, to carry bombs from both inner and outer pylons and to launch AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, the change to a primary air-to-ground role resulted in the Hunter 80 upgrade, adding chaff/flare dispensers, BL755 cluster bombs {{and the ability to}} carry AGM-65 Maverick missiles.|$|E
5|$|Rewrite {{marked the}} first time since Key's third game Clannad that Itaru Hinoue was staffed as the sole art {{director}} and character designer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Key</b> visual novel. The school uniforms for the heroines in the game are old designs that Hinoue created and used before in dōjinshi (self-published work). In particular, Hinoue spent much time on drawing the character art in Rewrite {{due in part to the}} design of the school uniforms, the fact that most of the female characters have long hair, and because of the increased aspect ratio. Six more graphic artists worked on Rewrite: Torino headed the background art, Ryou Shigawa designed and illustrated the monsters, and the computer graphics in the game were done by Na-Ga, Shinory, Mochisuke, and Minimo Tayama. The game's soundtrack was composed by Key's signature composers Jun Maeda and Shinji Orito, in addition to Maiko Iuchi of I've Sound, Sōshi Hosoi, and Ryō Mizutsuki. Maeda also contributed on the quality control for the game.|$|E
50|$|Since the submediant chord is minor <b>in</b> <b>a</b> major <b>key,</b> {{and major}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> minor <b>key,</b> it {{provides}} contrast with its tonic chord.

5|$|Three days later, United {{played their}} second MLS {{opponent}} of the preseason. This time, they played fellow conference foes, Chicago Fire, for the second match of the Challenge Cup. Played on 9 March, the match proved to be another successful game for newly acquired Brettschneider, as he tallied on the scoresheet in the 10th minute of play. Things would continue in United's way in the 37th minute, when Chicago midfielder Diego Cháves was ejected from {{the game in the}} 37th minute, allowing United to have a one-man advantage for {{a significant portion of the}} match. Consequently, the Fire would fail to create many goalscoring opportunities, being outshot 16–5 by United. Brettschneider's tenth-minute tally was the lone goal of the match, thus giving United a 2–0–0 record in the tournament table, and placing them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> position to win the entire cup.|$|E
5|$|As a {{delegate}} for the Junta, {{he led the}} ill-fated Paraguay campaign. His troops were defeated by Bernardo de Velasco at the battles of Campichuelo and Paraguarí. Though he was defeated, the campaign initiated the {{chain of events that}} led to the Independence of Paraguay in May 1811. He retreated to the vicinity of Rosario, to fortify it against a possible royalist attack from the Eastern Band of the Uruguay River. While there, he created the flag of Argentina. The First Triumvirate did not approve the flag, but because of slow communications, Belgrano would only learn of that many weeks later, while reinforcing the Army of the North at Jujuy. There, knowing he was at a strategic disadvantage against the royalist armies coming from Upper Peru, Belgrano ordered the Jujuy Exodus, which evacuated the entire population of Jujuy Province to San Miguel de Tucumán. His counter-offensive at the Battle of Tucumán resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> strategic victory, and it was soon followed by a complete victory over the royalist army of Pío Tristán at the Battle of Salta. However, his deeper incursions into Upper Perú led to defeats at Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, leading the Second Triumvirate to order his replacement as Commander of the Army of the North by the newly arrived José de San Martín. By then, the Asamblea del Año XIII had approved the use of Belgrano's flag as the national war flag.|$|E
5|$|Drogba {{continued}} scoring goals but {{suffered an}} injury at the training ground {{and decided to}} have an operation on his knee. He was unable to play for four weeks and missed key games against Valencia, Arsenal and Liverpool. Drogba returned from injury to play in an FA Cup third round match against Queens Park Rangers and wore the captain's armband for the last 30 minutes {{he was on the}} pitch, but that was his last performance for Chelsea before international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations. Upon his return, Drogba scored a goal in the 2008 League Cup Final, making him the all-time leading scorer in League Cup Finals with four goals, but could not help prevent Chelsea fall to a 2–1 defeat at the hands of Tottenham Hotspur. Drogba also became the first player to score in three League Cup finals and the first to score in three consecutive English domestic cup finals. He scored both goals <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> 2–1 victory against Arsenal on 23 March 2008, bringing Chelsea equal on points with leaders Manchester United.|$|E

Later, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> pioneering approach in 1973, it was rewritten in the C programming language by Dennis Ritchie (with the exception of some hardware and I/O routines).

50|$|Large ternary is {{the most}} common form used for a slow movement. It {{consists}} of three parts, labeled ABA.
