He lived a reclusive life in Iceland, avoiding entrepreneurs {{and others who}} approached him with various proposals. <b>Fischer</b> moved into {{an apartment in the}} same building as his close friend and spokesman, Garðar Sverrisson. Garðar's wife, Kristín Þórarinsdóttir, was a nurse and later looked after <b>Fischer</b> as a terminally ill patient. Garðar's two children, especially his son, were very close to <b>Fischer.</b> <b>Fischer</b> also developed a friendship with Magnús Skúlason, a psychiatrist and chess player who later recalled long discussions with him {{on a wide variety of}} subjects.|$|E
5|$|Bobby <b>Fischer</b> {{was born}} at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, on March 9, 1943.

50|$|<b>Fischer's</b> ideas {{informed}} the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 which served {{to justify the}} Nazi Party's belief in German racial superiority. Adolf Hitler read <b>Fischer's</b> work while he was imprisoned in 1923 and he used <b>Fischer's</b> eugenical notions to support the ideal of a pure Aryan society in his manifesto, Mein Kampf (My Struggle).|$|R
25|$|In 2005, critics {{charged that}} <b>Fischer's</b> {{relaxing}} of controls on visa regulations for Ukraine, would allow illegal immigrants to enter Germany with fake identities. A parliamentary committee {{was established to}} examine the case, and unlike in other such committee hearings, <b>Fischer's</b> statement (and that of other top officials) was shown live on public television. <b>Fischer's</b> appearance before the committee lasted twelve hours.

5|$|In April–May 1970, <b>Fischer</b> won at Rovinj/Zagreb with 13/17 (+10−1=6), by a {{two-point}} margin, {{ahead of}} Gligorić, Hort, Korchnoi, Smyslov, and Petrosian. In July–August, <b>Fischer</b> crushed the mostly grandmaster field at Buenos Aires, winning by a 3½-point margin, scoring 15/17 (+13−0=4). <b>Fischer</b> then played first {{board for the}} U.S. Team in the 19th Chess Olympiad in Siegen, where he won an individual Silver medal, scoring 10/13 (+8−1=4), with his only loss being to World Champion Boris Spassky. Right after the Olympiad, <b>Fischer</b> defeated Ulf Andersson in an exhibition game for the Swedish newspaper Expressen. <b>Fischer</b> had taken his game to a new level.|$|E

5|$|In the 1962–63 U.S. Championship, <b>Fischer</b> {{experienced}} {{his first}} single-game loss (to Edmar Mednis) in round one. Bisguier was in excellent form, and <b>Fischer</b> {{caught up to}} him only at the end. Tied at 7–3, the two met in the final round. Bisguier stood well in the middlegame, but blundered, handing <b>Fischer</b> his fifth consecutive U.S. championship.|$|E

5|$|<b>Fischer's</b> {{estate was}} {{estimated}} at 140 million ISK (about 1 million GBP, or $2 million USD). It quickly became {{the object of a}} legal battle involving claims from four parties, with Miyoko Watai ultimately inheriting what remained of <b>Fischer's</b> estate after government claims. The four parties were <b>Fischer's</b> apparent Japanese wife Miyoko Watai, his alleged Filipino daughter Jinky Young and her mother Marilyn Young, his two American nephews Alexander and Nicholas Targ and their father Russell Targ, and the U.S. government (claiming unpaid taxes).|$|R
50|$|Much of <b>Fischer's</b> music {{shows the}} {{influence}} of the French Baroque style, exemplified by Jean Baptiste Lully, and he was responsible for bringing the French influence to German music. <b>Fischer's</b> harpsichord suites updated the standard Froberger model (Allemande - Courante - Sarabande - Gigue); he {{was also one of the}} first composers to apply the principles of the orchestral suite to the harpsichord, replacing the standard French ouverture with an unmeasured prelude. Both Bach and Handel knew <b>Fischer's</b> work and sometimes borrowed from it.|$|R

5|$|The {{next seven}} games (games 14 through 20) were drawn. <b>Fischer</b> {{was unable to}} get the initiative. Spassky was {{choosing}} lines that <b>Fischer</b> was unable to break. With a three-point lead, <b>Fischer</b> was content to inch towards the title, and Spassky seemed resigned to his fate. The off-the-board antics continued, including a lawsuit against <b>Fischer</b> for damages by Chester Fox, who had filming rights to the match (<b>Fischer</b> had objected {{to what he said}} were noticeable camera noises, and the Icelandic hosts had reluctantly– they were to share in film revenues along with the two contestants– removed the television cameras), a <b>Fischer</b> demand to remove the first seven rows of spectators (eventually, three rows were cleared), and Soviet claims that <b>Fischer</b> was using electronic and chemical devices to 'control' Spassky, resulting in an Icelandic police sweep of the hall.|$|E

Ritter claimed that Germany did not start a war of aggression in 1914 but admitted that the situation of the German government had required a foreign policy that contained the immediate risk of war. Counter to <b>Fischer's</b> thesis, Ritter maintained that the Chancellor Dr. Theobald von Bethmann-Hollwegresisted the demands by General Ludendorff for wide-ranging annexations as a war aim.|$|R

5|$|As Black, <b>Fischer</b> {{would usually}} play the Najdorf Sicilian against 1.e4, and the King's Indian Defense against 1.d4, only rarely venturing into the Nimzo-Indian (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4), Benoni, Grünfeld or Neo-Grünfeld. As White, <b>Fischer</b> almost {{exclusively}} played 1.e4 throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|At the 1962 Varna Olympiad, <b>Fischer</b> {{predicted}} {{that he would}} defeat Argentinian GM Miguel Najdorf in 25 moves. <b>Fischer</b> actually did it in 24, becoming the only player to beat Najdorf in the tournament. Ironically, Najdorf lost the game whilst employing the very opening variation named after him: the Sicilian Najdorf.|$|E
5|$|At the 1967 Interzonal, held at Sousse, Tunisia, <b>Fischer</b> scored 8½ {{points in}} the first 10 games, to lead the field. His {{observance}} of the Worldwide Church of God's seventh-day Sabbath was honored by the organizers, but deprived <b>Fischer</b> of several rest days, which led to a scheduling dispute, causing <b>Fischer</b> to forfeit two games in protest and later withdraw, eliminating himself from the 1969 World Championship cycle. Communications difficulties with the highly inexperienced local organizers were also a significant factor, since <b>Fischer</b> knew little French and the organizers had very limited English. No one in Tunisian chess had previous experience running an event of this stature.|$|E
