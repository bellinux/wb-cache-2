5|$|In 1637 Wiśniowiecki {{might have}} fought under Hetman Mikołaj Potocki against the Cossack {{rebellion}} of Pavel Pavluk (the Pawluk Uprising); Jan Widacki notes that historians are not certain whether <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> in either case, no detailed accounts of his possible participation survive. A year later, {{returning from the}} Sejm and from the engagement ceremony with Gryzelda, he gathered a 4,000 strong division that participated in putting down of the Ostrzanin Uprising and arrived at the region affected by the unrest in June that year. Together with Hetman Potocki he defeated the insurgents at the Battle of Żownin, which turned into a rather difficult siege of the Cossack camp that lasted from 13 June till the Cossack relief forces were defeated on 4 August, and the Cossacks capitulated on 7 August.|$|E
5|$|The courts {{eventually}} {{decided the}} Warner Bros. lawsuit in Cagney's favor. He {{had done what}} many thought unthinkable: taking on the studios and winning. Not only did he win, but Warner Bros. also {{knew that he was}} still their foremost box office draw and invited him back for a five-year, $150,000-a-film deal, with no more than two pictures a year. Cagney also had full say over what films <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> did not make. Additionally, William Cagney was guaranteed the position of assistant producer for the movies in which his brother starred.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Ferdinand and Marie {{moved to}} Cotroceni Palace, {{which had been}} {{extended}} by the Romanian architect Grigore Cerchez, and to which Marie added her own designs. The following year, Ferdinand was struck down with typhoid fever. For days, he was delirious and, despite his doctor's best efforts, came close to dying. During this time, Marie exchanged numerous letters with her family in Britain and was terrified {{at the prospect of}} losing her husband. King Carol still had an heir in Prince Carol, whose young age presented issues; thus, the whole family desperately wished for Ferdinand to pull through. Eventually, <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> he and Marie went to Sinaia, the site of Peleș Castle, for a period of recovery. Nonetheless, the couple was not able to attend celebrations for Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee that summer. During Ferdinand's convalescence, Marie spent most of her time with her two children, taking them on long walks and picking flowers with them. The winter of 1897/1898 was spent with the Russian Imperial family on the French Riviera, where Marie often rode horses, in spite of the low temperatures.|$|E

5|$|On lap 20 it was {{announced}} that Vergne was under investigation by the stewards after he was observed speeding in the pit lane. He was issued with a drive-through penalty three laps later, ending his chances of battling for the victory. He remerged in fifth place ahead of both Audi Sport ABT cars but behind Prost, and Buemi inherited second place. Duval stopped on the track with powertrain problems on the 25th lap but was able to restart his car and continued in 18th position. Having made a pit stop one lap earlier {{than the rest of the}} field, Rosenqvist conserved electrical energy usage, allowing Buemi to close up to him at a rate of nearly two seconds per lap because he used Fan Boost, had more electrical energy available to him, and the requirement to lift and coast was minimal. Abt lost sixth place when was overtaken by teammate di Grassi at the sixth turn on lap 27. Shortly afterwards, Buemi drafted Rosenqvist, braked later than <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> overtook him around the outside at turn eleven to take over the lead. López passed Frijns to move into tenth place. Vergne attempted to move ahead of Prost but was unable to pass, allowing di Grassi to close up to Vergne. Vergne defended his position, but di Grassi overtook him at turn seven to take over fifth place.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} folk {{tales of the}} Tylwyth Teg, the fairy people who {{inhabited}} the area and an invisible land in Cardigan Bay. One tells of a farmer from Aberdaron {{who was in the}} habit of stepping outside his house before retiring to bed. One night he was spoken to by a stranger, who asked why the farmer was annoyed by him. The farmer, confused, asked what the stranger meant and was told to stand with one foot on the stranger's. This <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> could see another house, just below his own, and that all the farm's slops went down the chimney of the invisible house. The stranger asked if the farmer would move his door {{to the other side of}} the house, which the farmer subsequently did, walling up the original door; from that day, the farmer's livestock flourished, and he became one of the most prosperous men in the area.|$|E

25|$|Several groups {{fought over}} control of the {{sanctuary}} at Olympia, and hence the games, for prestige and political advantage. Pausanias later writes that in 668BC, Pheidon of Argos was commissioned by the town of Pisa to capture the sanctuary from the town of Elis, which <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> then personally controlled the games for that year. The next year, Elis regained control.|$|E

Stories claim that a small painter has been seen at work on the steeple during lightning flashes. His moans during Sunday services were mistaken for worshippers snoring.|$|E

25|$|When Hubert Walter {{emerged as}} Archbishop of Canterbury in 1193, Peter {{was no longer}} {{retained}} in any formal capacity by the archdiocese, although he was still consulted. He tried to repair relations with the cathedral chapter, claiming Henry II had compelled him to act as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> {{that he had been}} cruelly deceived - a claim that probably met with incredulity. He also continued to exercise considerable influence over other leading churchmen. At some time in the 1190s, for example, he wrote 'Against the Perfidy of the Jews', which Peter commended in a preface to a Bishop of Worcester, probably John of Coutances.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{traditional}} Muslim view, the emergence of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) {{goes back to the}} lifetime of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. In this view, his companions and followers took what <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> approved of as a model (sunnah) and transmitted this information to the succeeding generations in the form of hadith. These reports led first to informal discussion and then systematic legal thought, articulated with greatest success in the eighth and ninth centuries by the master jurists Abu Hanifah, Malik ibn Anas, Al-Shafi‘i, and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, who are viewed as the founders of the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafiʿi, and Hanbali legal schools (madhhabs) of Sunni jurisprudence.|$|E

This is the secret that has not yet been told in the affair: the story of the security fiasco that made it possible for Vanunu to do what <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> the story of subsequent attempts to cover-up, whitewash and protect senior figures in the defense establishment, who were bent on divesting themselves of responsibility for the failure.|$|E

25|$|Crony {{capitalism}} was {{an important}} part of American industrialism during this period. Thomas Carnegie, however, was not very adept at it. There is conflicting evidence as to whether he mixed widely in Pittsburgh society, with at least one scholar claiming <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> another that he did not. He was reserved at social gatherings, using his attendance at parties to pick up business gossip and industry buzz. He played cards on a weekly basis with Henry Clay Frick, Philander Knox, Andrew and Richard Mellon, and George Westinghouse. His closest friend was David A. Stewart, a co-partner in the Thomson works, and Stewart readily defended Thomas against the criticisms and jibes of others (particularly Andrew Carnegie).|$|E
25|$|The journey {{down the}} Coppermine River took {{far longer than}} planned, and Franklin quickly lost faith in his first nation guides, who in fact knew the area little better than <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> assured him that the sea was close, then far, then close again. The Arctic Ocean was finally sighted on 14 July 1821, shortly before the {{expedition}} encountered its first Inuit camp. The Inuit fled, and Franklin's men never {{had the opportunity to}} make further contact or trade for supplies as he had hoped. The abandoned camp gave a further indication of the scarcity of food in the area; the stocks of dried salmon were rotting and maggot-infested, and the meat which was drying consisted mainly of small birds and mice.|$|E
25|$|The {{parties had}} turned to {{arbitration}} to settle a lingering issue from the termination of a lease: whether Mattel was contractually bound to indemnify Hall Street for environmental contamination {{to the site of}} a factory it rented from Hall Street in Beaverton, Oregon until closing it in 2001. The arbitrator had decided that the statute covering the groundwater pollution was primarily a health law, and so ruled that Mattel did not have to pay Hall Street's costs. Since the arbitration agreement had taken the form of an order from a district judge, Mattel and Hall Street had included a provision that the judge could review the arbitration award, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> the award was reversed. It went back and forth twice between the district court and the Ninth Circuit before the Supreme Court granted certiorari.|$|E
