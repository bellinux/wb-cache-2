25|$|Rescue {{involves}} {{bringing the}} person's {{mouth and nose}} above the water surface. A <b>drowning</b> <b>person</b> may cling to the rescuer and try to pull {{himself out of the}} water, submerging the rescuer in the process. Rescuers should avoid endangering themselves unnecessarily and where possible should provide assistance from a safe position, such as a boat, or by providing flotation or a means of towing from a distance.|$|E
25|$|Snell's law can {{be derived}} from Fermat's principle, which states that the light travels the path which takes the least time. By taking the {{derivative}} of the optical path length, the stationary point is found giving the path taken by the light (though {{it should be noted that}} the result does not show light taking the least time path, but rather one that is stationary with respect to small variations as there are cases where light actually takes the greatest time path, as in a spherical mirror). In a classic analogy, the area of lower refractive index is replaced by a beach, the area of higher refractive index by the sea, and the fastest way for a rescuer on the beach to get to a <b>drowning</b> <b>person</b> in the sea is to run along a path that follows Snell's law.|$|E
25|$|While one Days follows their Lord, their {{counterpart}} {{lives in}} a monastery-type environment in the far north of Orwynne, kept away from anything other than their principal purpose, to compile the life journal of their chosen Runelord. The power of the Days order comes from knowing that {{at any given time}} they can find out what is happening to any particular noble at any place in the world. Therefore, should they wish to, the Days could influence events on a kingdom-wide scale. However, their service is completely focused upon observation, with a strict policy of noninterference – {{even in the face of}} cataclysmic war they would not act to save millions, nor would a Days stop to save a single <b>drowning</b> <b>person.</b> Rumors and legends abound, though, of some Days or another betraying his vows of noninterference and sharing knowledge with his lord. They also seem to use their knowledge to tear down lords who attempt to drive them away, sharing the lord's plans and secrets with his enemies.|$|E
50|$|The Burial of <b>Drowned</b> <b>Persons</b> Act 1808, {{also known}} as Grylls' Act, is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (citation 48 Geo III c.75). The act {{provides}} that unclaimed bodies of dead persons cast ashore from the sea should be removed by the churchwardens and overseers of the parish, and decently interred in consecrated ground. This act was amended by the Burial of <b>Drowned</b> <b>Persons</b> Act 1886 (citation 49 & 50 Vict c.20), to extend its applicability to bodies found in, or cast on shore from, all tidal or navigable waters.|$|R
40|$|The theoretic {{part of the}} baccalaureate {{thesis is}} focused on {{providing}} first aid to <b>drowning</b> <b>persons,</b> on providing proper cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and {{on the possibility of}} using rescue and protective aids. This part explains principal causes of drowning, warns about places where drowning occurs most often, and indicates ways of prevention and safety. The purpose of the research part of the thesis was to determine whether the lay public has any theoretic knowledge of providing first aid to <b>drowning</b> <b>persons.</b> A quantitative method was used in the research part for data collection. The data was obtained using questionnaires, which were distributed to the lay public in the Uherské Hradiště region. The questionnaire was anonymous and included 14 questions. There was only one correct answer to every question. The questions were used to determine theoretic knowledge of first aid provision to <b>drowning</b> <b>persons</b> and theoretic knowledge of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The hypothesis presumed that the lay public had theoretic knowledge in providing first aid to <b>drowning</b> <b>persons.</b> However, the opposite followed from the defined criterion used to prove or disprove the hypothesis and from the quantitative investigation results, i. e. that the lay public did not have theoretic knowledge in providing first aid to <b>drowning</b> <b>persons.</b> Thus the hypothesis was disproved based on the research. The lay public showed insufficient knowledge particularly of cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedures. The research concluded that the lay public should be more interested in the procedures and novelties in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, {{as well as in the}} basics of first aid. Also, acquaintance with first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be more and better available to the lay public. A solution could be offered by compulsory first aid courses for all professions, provided by employers on a yearly basis at least...|$|R

50|$|Anson {{was lost}} in a {{shipwreck}} on 29 December 1807. Trapped by a lee shore off Loe Bar, Cornwall, she hit the rocks and between 60 and 190 men were killed.

60|$|In this arduous {{work that}} heroic man had, during {{five years of}} service, saved with his own hands between thirty and forty lives--in some cases with a boat, {{but in most cases}} by simply {{swimming}} out and seizing the <b>drowning</b> <b>persons,</b> and without using corks or floats of any kind. When asked why he did not use a lifebelt, he said that it would only impede his motions and prevent him from diving, which he was often compelled to do when the <b>drowning</b> <b>persons</b> had sunk. His usual method was to swim off when there was a shout for help, and make for the struggling man or boy so as to come up behind him. He then seized him under the armpits, and thus effectually prevented him from grasping him in any way. Drawing him gently upon his breast while he lay over on his back, he then made for the shore, swimming on his back and using his feet only.|$|R
60|$|He was {{interested}} by the celerity, the simultaneity of his impressions, his reflections. It {{occurred to him}} that his abnormal alertness must be something like that of a <b>drowning</b> <b>person,</b> or a person in mortal peril, and being perfectly safe and well, he was obscurely flattered by the fact.|$|E
60|$|It was the strangle-hold of a <b>drowning</b> <b>person,</b> and {{our hero}} might have fared badly had not {{assistance}} been at hand.

50|$|Opposite of the windmill, the Graveyard of the Homeless is located, where {{unidentified}} <b>drowned</b> <b>persons</b> are buried. Most graves {{date back}} to the early 20th century, the youngest being from 1969. Since then, all bodies washed ashore on Amrum's beaches could reliably be identified due to improved forensic techniques.

The one who had been uppermost was Yeobright; he who had been completely submerged was Wildeve.|$|R
60|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. Now I {{am quite}} {{out of my}} depth. I usually am when Lord Illingworth says anything. And the Humane Society is most careless. They never rescue me. I am left to sink. I have a dim idea, dear Lord Illingworth, that you are always {{on the side of}} the sinners, and I know I always try to be {{on the side of the}} saints, but that is as far as I get. And after all, it may be merely the fancy of a <b>drowning</b> <b>person.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Yet on {{the whole}} I {{think it is a}} matter for general {{congratulation}} that they were not engaged in the rescue of a genuinely <b>drowning</b> <b>person.</b> At the time of my enquiries whatever soreness of argument that may once have obtained between them had passed, and it is fairly clear that while Fred Bunting was engaged in swimming hard against the long side of the ladder and so causing it to rotate slowly on its axis, Mr. Bunting had already swallowed a very considerable amount of sea-water and was kicking Fred in the chest with aimless vigour. This he did, as he explains, [...] "to get my legs down, you know. Something about that ladder, you know, and they would go up!" ...|$|E

[Footnote 55: One of his pranks is thus narrated: Two men, in a {{very dark}} night, {{approaching}} {{the banks of the}} Ettrick, heard a doleful voice from its waves repeatedly exclaim--"Lost! lost!"--They followed the sound, which seemed to be the voice of a <b>drowning</b> <b>person,</b> and, to their infinite astonishment, they found that it ascended the river. Still they continued, during a long and tempestuous night, to follow the cry of the malicious sprite; and arriving, before morning's dawn, at the very sources of the river, the voice was now heard descending {{the opposite side of the}} mountain in which they arise. The fatigued and deluded travellers now relinquished the pursuit; and had no sooner done so, than they heard Shellycoat applauding, in loud bursts of laughter, his successful roguery. The spirit was supposed particularly to haunt the old house of Gorrinberry, situated on the river Hermitage, in Liddesdale.] ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the depths}} of the sea, lives the draug or the Strandvaskare. The draug is the spirit of a person who died at sea. He sails through the sea in half a boat. If someone happens to see a draug, they are in mortal danger unless they race the draug and win. The word Strandvaskere is found in Danish, Swedish and Norwegian. It refers to a <b>drowned</b> <b>person</b> washing up on the shore.|$|R

6000|$|Leila {{was only}} too well aware of a truth that {{feelings}} are no less real, poignant, and important to those outside morality's ring fence than to those within. Her feelings were, indeed, probably even more real and poignant, just as a wild fruit's flavour is sharper {{than that of the}} tame product. Opinion--she knew--would say, that having wilfully chosen a position outside morality she had not half the case for brokenheartedness she would have had if Fort had been her husband: Opinion--she knew--would say she had no claim on him, and the sooner an illegal tie was broken, the better! But she felt fully as wretched {{as if she had been}} married. She had not wanted to be outside morality; never in her life wanted to be that. She was like those who by confession shed their sins and start again with a clear conscience. She never meant to sin, only to love, and when she was in love, nothing else mattered for the moment. But, though a gambler, she had always so far paid up. Only, this time the stakes were the heaviest a woman can put down. It was her last throw; and she knew it. So long as a woman believed in her attraction, there was hope, even when the curtain fell on a love-affair! But for Leila the lamp of belief had suddenly gone out, and when this next curtain dropped she felt that she must sit in the dark until old age made her indifferent. And between forty-four and real old age a gulf is fixed. This was the first time a man had tired of her. Why! he had been tired before he began, or so she felt. In one swift moment as of a <b>drowning</b> <b>person,</b> she saw again all the passages of their companionship, knew with certainty that it had never been a genuine flame. Shame ran, consuming, in her veins. She buried her face in the cushions. This girl had possessed his real heart all the time. With a laugh she thought: 'I put my money on the wrong horse; I ought to have backed Edward. I could have turned that poor monk's head. If only I had never seen Jimmy again; if I had torn his letter up, I could have made poor Edward love me!' Ifs! What folly! Things happened as they must! ...|$|E

5000|$|A death grip is an {{extremely}} tight grip, such as that exerted by {{a person in a}} panic for fear for their life. This was commonly thought to be a risk when rescuing a <b>drowning</b> <b>person</b> - that they would cling to their rescuer with a death grip which would cause them both to perish. Investigation showed that this did not actually happen in practice and so breaking a death grip is no longer emphasised in lifesaving. [...] The actual behaviour of a <b>drowning</b> <b>person</b> is more passive as they lack the oxygen to take violent action and an instinctive paddling reflex occurs.|$|E

50|$|Ved-ava is a water deity, {{common to}} several Finno-Ugric peoples {{traditionally}} dependent on fishing. She is also sometimes associated with fertility. She is generally {{depicted as a}} water creature resembling a mermaid, with long hair, large breasts, and the lower body of a fish complete with tail, and is sometimes said to play or sing, seducing humans with her music. Fishermen sacrificed to her the first of their catch and observed numerous taboos related to her while fishing. Seeing Ved-ava boded ill, most often drowning. She has been regarded as {{the spirit of a}} <b>drowned</b> <b>person</b> or simply as a personification of the water itself.|$|R
60|$|This! letter gave me {{a dreadful}} shock.

50|$|The {{loss of the}} Anson caused {{controversy}} at the time, {{because of}} {{the treatment of the}} dead sailors washed ashore. In those days it was customary to bury unceremoniously drowned seamen without shroud or coffin in unconsecrated ground, with bodies remaining unburied for long periods of time. This controversy led to a local solicitor, Thomas Grylls, drafting a new law to provide drowned seamen more decent treatment. This law was introduced to parliament by John Hearle Tremayne, Member of Parliament for Cornwall, and was enacted as the Burial of <b>Drowned</b> <b>Persons</b> Act 1808. A monument to the drowned sailors, and to passing of the Grylls Act, stands near the entrance to the harbour of Porthleven.|$|R
