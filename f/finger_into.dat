5|$|Linguist Jesse Sheidlower {{traces the}} gesture's {{development}} in the United States to the 1890s. According to anthropologist Desmond Morris, the gesture probably came to the United States via Italian immigrants. The first documented appearance of the finger in the United States was in 1886, when Old Hoss Radbourn, a baseball pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters, was photographed giving it {{to a member of}} their rival the New York Giants. In the film Speedy (1928), Harold Lloyd's character gives himself the <b>finger</b> <b>into</b> a distorting mirror at Luna Park, about 24 minutes into the film.|$|E

25|$|After a quick TKO {{victory over}} {{decorated}} judoka Yoon Dong-Sik {{in the opening}} round, Sakuraba suffered a particularly devastating yet controversial loss against Ricardo Arona in the quarterfinal of the tournament in June 2005. Although Sakuraba put Arona {{on his back and}} seemed to put to work his signature jumping stomps, the heavier and stronger Arona soon overpowered him, landing a series of brutal knees to the head, as well as hard soccer kicks to the face. The Brazilian's toenail accidentally slashed open the skin over Sakuraba's left eye, which Ricardo then capitalized on by squeezing the cut and digging his <b>finger</b> <b>into</b> it in order to force the doctor stoppage. The Japanese tried to keep on, but Arona hit another flurry of knees to the head, and ended the fight landing soccer kick after soccer kick, rendering Kazushi's face severely swollen and bloody. Arona won by unanimous decision.|$|E
25|$|In the testy Game 3 of the 2003 ALCS, after {{allowing}} single {{runs in the}} 2nd, 3rd, and 4th innings, Martínez hit Yankees {{right fielder}} Karim García near the shoulders with a pitch, sparking a shouting match between Martínez and the New York bench. Directing his attention at Yankees catcher Jorge Posada, Martínez jabbed a <b>finger</b> <b>into</b> {{the side of his}} own head, which some, including an enraged Yankee bench coach Don Zimmer, interpreted as a threatened beanball. Emotions remained high {{in the bottom of the}} inning, which was led off by Boston slugger Manny Ramírez. Ramirez became irate over a high strike from Roger Clemens, and both benches cleared. During the ensuing commotion, the 72-year-old Zimmer ran towards Martínez in an attempt to knock him down; Martínez sidestepped Zimmer and threw him to the ground. Later, Martínez claimed that he was not indicating that he would hit Posada in the head, but that he would remember what Posada was saying to him. In 2009, Martínez claimed that he regretted the incident but denied being at fault. Zimmer did not give much credence to Pedro's statements. Martínez wrote in 2015 that the altercation with Zimmer was his only regret of his entire career.|$|E
500|$|Although {{time was}} plentiful, the pitch {{had begun to}} {{deteriorate}} and Australia look defeated after they had fallen to 5/57, prompting Davidson to join local batsman Ken Mackay at the crease. They took the score to 92 when Mackay fell and Australia's chances of winning looked remote as Davidson and Benaud reached tea at 6/109 with 124runs still required with only the tailenders were to follow. Despite this, Benaud told chairman of selectors Don Bradman that he would still be going for an improbable victory in accordance with his policy of aggressive strategy. With an attacking partnership, the pair took Australia to {{within sight of the}} target. The pair added 50 runs in 55 minutes. Davidson hooked leading paceman Wes Hall repeatedly and Benaud attacked the spinners when Worrell took Hall off. Both men were noted for their hitting ability and viewed attack as their most effective chance of survival. Davidson hit four fours from the leg spin of Sonny Ramadhin, and the deficit dwindled to 60 with one hour remaining and 27 with 30 minutes to go. The pair took 17 runs from the next two overs, and regular boundaries and quickly run singles took Australia into what looked like a victorious position. They took the score to 226 with a seventh wicket partnership of 134. Only seven runs were required with four wickets in hand as time was running short. Benaud hit a ball into the covers and the pair attempted a quick single, but a direct hit from Joe Solomon saw Davidson run out for his highest Test score of 80. Davidson reflected [...] "I was as dirty as anyone ever has been". Australia needed six runs from the final over with three wickets in hand but Benaud was caught and the last two players fell to run outs while attempting the winning run. The match was tie in Test cricket, and Davidson had achieved his unprecedented feat despite carrying a broken <b>finger</b> <b>into</b> the match. Bradman joked that he should break his finger before every match.|$|E

The Institute also portrays the scientific community's reaction to the Wedge document as driven by [...] "Darwinist Paranoia." [...] Despite insisting that intelligent design is not a form of creationism, the Discovery Institute chose to use an image of Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam, depicting God reaching out to impart life from his <b>finger</b> <b>into</b> Adam.|$|E

2500|$|One {{account is}} from the 13th century by Shlemon of Basra. According to it, John the Apostle had hidden {{a part of the}} portion of bread he had {{received}} from Jesus during the Last Supper. Then, after Jesus' resurrection during the Gospel account of Doubting Thomas, when Thomas the Apostle put his <b>finger</b> <b>into</b> one of the wounds of Jesus inflicted by the spear, blood dripped out. John then dipped the bread in the blood, and that mix became the Holy Leaven. According to this version, the Holy Leaven was taken to the Christians of the East by Thaddeus of Edessa and Saint Mari, but the other Seventy disciples of Jesus refused it, saying: [...] "We will consecrate for ourselves whenever we wish." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later that day, at evening, Jesus {{appears to}} the disciples and shows them the wounds {{in his hands}} and his side in [...] Thomas the Apostle is not present at that meeting and later expresses doubt about the resurrection of Jesus. As Thomas is expressing his doubts, in the well known Doubting Thomas episode in [...] Jesus appears to him and invites him to put his <b>finger</b> <b>into</b> the holes made by the wounds in Jesus' hands and side. [...] Thomas then professes his faith in Jesus. In , in the Great Commission Jesus appears to his {{followers}} on a mountain in Galilee and calls on them to baptize all nations {{in the name of the}} [...] "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit".|$|E

2500|$|Frodo {{inherited}} the Ring from his uncle Bilbo Baggins. [...] In Tolkien's earlier novel, The Hobbit, Bilbo found the Ring in the caverns beneath the Misty Mountains. It {{had been lost}} in the caverns by Gollum, who used the invisibility it conferred to hunt orcs to eat. Gollum, a hobbit previously known as Sméagol, had kept the Ring for hundreds of years. He had murdered his friend Déagol to get the Ring shortly after Déagol found it in the river Anduin. [...] Many centuries earlier the Ring had betrayed Isildur and fallen from his <b>finger</b> <b>into</b> the Anduin as he was eluding orcs—who killed him when he became visible. Isildur in turn had cut the Ring from the hand of Sauron, who had made the Ring and let much of his power flow into it. Sauron was the Ring's true master, and the only being who could bend it completely to his will.|$|E
2500|$|Alpay {{returned}} to the Aston Villa team {{for the beginning of}} the 2003–04 season. In his first home game against Charlton Athletic, he was booed when walking on to the pitch by his own fans. However Alpay went on to score the first goal of that game. In consequence to his earlier booing, Alpay's goal celebration served to mock the Aston Villa fans by placing his finger on his mouth. He was again dropped due to their angry reaction. The Turkish defender was then made public enemy number one in England in late 2003 after a run-in with David Beckham during the Euro 2004 qualifier in Istanbul. He first confronted the England skipper after his first-half penalty miss, glowering over him and rubbing heads with him {{in full view of the}} referee. He followed that up by prodding a <b>finger</b> <b>into</b> Beckham's face as the players came off the pitch at half-time, sparking a tunnel brawl. Due to the angry reactions in England, his contract was terminated by Aston Villa on 23 October. Club chairman Doug Ellis declared: ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{they found}} the empty tomb, the gospels {{indicate}} that Jesus {{made a series of}} appearances to the disciples. He was not immediately recognizable, according to Luke. E. P. Sanders concluded that although he could appear and disappear, he was not a ghost. Writing that Luke was very insistent about that, Sanders pointed out that [...] "the risen Lord could be touched, and he could eat". He first appeared to Mary Magdalene, but she did not recognize him at first. The first two disciples to whom he appeared, walked and talked with him for quite a while without knowing who he was, (the road to Emmaus appearance). He was made known [...] "in the breaking of the bread". When he first appeared to the disciples in the upper room, Thomas was not present and wouldn't believe until a later appearance where he was invited to put his <b>finger</b> <b>into</b> the holes in Jesus' hands and side. Beside the Sea of Galilee he encouraged Peter to serve his followers. [...] His final appearance is reported as being forty days after the resurrection when he was [...] "carried up" [...] into heaven where he sits on the right hand of God.|$|E
