50|$|While {{only one}} oxhide ingot {{fragment}} has been recovered from Egypt (in {{the context of}} a LBA smelting workshop), there is a wide array of painted scenes in Egypt that show oxhide ingots. The earliest scene dates to the 15th century BC and the latest scene to the 12th century BC. The ingots display their typical four protrusions, and red paint (which suggests they are copper) is preserved on them. The captions accompanying the scenes explain that the men who bring the ingots come from the north, specifically Retnu (Syria) and Keftiu (unidentified). They are shown being carried on the shoulders of men, sitting with other <b>goods</b> <b>in</b> <b>storage,</b> or as part of scenes in smelting workshops. In a relief from Karnak, the pharaoh Amenhotep II is seen riding a chariot and spearing an oxhide ingot with five arrows. A laudatory caption emphasizing the pharaoh’s strength accompanies the scene.|$|E

In the process this time, companies are experiencing increased demand developments and increasingly faced with such a tight competition with companies operating in the same field. The bigger the company, the level of demand for raw materials will be higher. To make a purchase either raw materials the company needs an appropriate system. If the company's strategy is not appropriate, the company could have folded. In this study, the authors are interested to explore more about the internal control system needed in purchasing raw materials that occurred in the PT. Tri Cakrawala Adiguna. This study aims to determine the internal control system which already applies to purchases of raw materials PT. Tri Cakrawala Adiguna today. Once known, can be evaluated against the internal control systems that already exist. This evaluation will show {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} internal control systems purchases of raw materials that have been running the company. The results obtained by the authors, indicate that PT. Tri Cakrawala Adiguna already have a clear organizational structure. Seen from the line of authority and responsibility.

Storage was very diverse among crops, for example, root crops were placed in the middle of layers of straw, bound into bales with rope and stored in rectangular structures, while maize was stored shelled, in large jars which were put in circular storehouses with stone floors.
