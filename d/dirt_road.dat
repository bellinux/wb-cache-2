5|$|Glenwood Canyon {{has served}} as the primary {{transportation}} artery through the Rocky Mountains, even before the creation of U.S. highways. Railroads have used the canyon since 1887 and a <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> was built through the canyon in the early 20th century. The first paved road was built from 1936 to 1938 at a cost of $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million today).|$|E

Away from cities and towns, the bridges were all located along <b>dirt</b> <b>roads,</b> {{though they were}} still all {{accessible}} by automobile save one. Even so, they were really only accessible in dry weather as rain renders many Illinois <b>dirt</b> <b>roads</b> impassable for the average car.|$|R
5|$|The first road to use {{the general}} {{alignment}} of modern Route 14 was called the El Camino Sierra, or Sierra Highway, which extended from Los Angeles to Lake Tahoe. A <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> was completed in the 1910s from {{what had been a}} pack trail. The Los Angeles Times declared El Camino Sierra complete in 1931, when the portion from Mojave to the Owens Valley, along modern US 395, was paved.|$|E
5|$|Although the LNC {{proposed}} {{to convert the}} cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery, this never took place. The rails and sleepers of the branch were removed in around 1947, and the trackbed became a <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> and footpath. The run-around loop and stub of the branch line west of Brookwood station remained operational as sidings, before being dismantled on 30 November 1964. After {{the closure of the}} branch line the buildings of the two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks, and were renamed North Bar and South Bar.|$|E
5|$|At {{a bend in}} the highway, {{there is}} a small patch of development, with a few houses near the highway. At the {{intersection}} with Township Road 529, State Route 664 enters Gallagher Township. Eventually, the large patch of forests in the surroundings come towards a clearing, where the highway intersects with Old <b>Dirt</b> <b>Road.</b> After crossing a stream, State Route 664 gains the moniker of the Coudersport Pike. The highway passes a small patch of development, reaching another clearing in the forest. After entering another forest, State Route 664 ends at an intersection with State Route 44 in the community of Haneyville.|$|E

5000|$|Most of {{the roads}} in the breaks are simply <b>dirt</b> <b>roads.</b> Only a few are graveled. <b>Dirt</b> <b>roads</b> in the Cow Creek area (as well {{as most of the}} Missouri Breaks) can be traversed only with extreme {{difficulty}} (if at all) when wet. The breaks are partially eroded from clays of the Cretaceous formations which contain bentonite. When wet the surface of these clays becomes slick and then becomes [...] "gumbo" [...] which clings to and builds up on tires, wheels, feet and hooves. If caught on <b>dirt</b> <b>roads</b> in the breaks by rain the best (and sometimes the only) course is to simply wait till the surface dries out.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to notification from Air Traffic Control, three ambulances from Perth were despatched {{in the direction}} of the crash site, known to be somewhere between Chidlow and York. The crash site was several miles from the road so the ambulance crews travelled eastwards all the way to York without sighting a fire. The crews were eventually guided back along the main road and then along a <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> that enabled them to drive to within three or four miles of the crash site. The crews then took their first-aid boxes and set out on foot.|$|E
5|$|The Barlow Road {{begins at}} The Dalles and heads south to Tygh Valley (some {{consider}} Tygh Valley {{to be the}} beginning), then turns west and roughly parallels the White River on the north and then west, crosses the south shoulder of Mount Hood at Barlow Pass, follows Camp Creek and the Sandy River for some way, and finally leads to Oregon City. The road was rendered largely irrelevant in the early 1900s by {{the construction of the}} Mount Hood Highway. It still exists as a <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> in some places, while many other parts have been paved over by newer streets and highways.|$|E
5|$|The route {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 93 northwest of Congress and southeast of Nothing. Beginning at US 93 southbound, SR 97 crosses US 93 northbound after several feet. It crosses through a desert region in a northeasterly direction, meeting a <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> that connects back to US 93. SR 97 curves northward before heading eastward at an intersection with Burro Creek Road. Again turning northeastward, the roadway meets various local roads, {{most of them}} dirt. The highway meets its northern terminus at SR 96, which continues northwestward toward Bagdad.|$|E

5|$|RE 8 {{begins at}} an {{at-grade}} intersection with TX 72 {{south of the}} unincorporated community of Calliham. The highway proceeds as a two-lane, paved road, traveling northward toward Calliham. As it travels through mainly rural areas, the route intersects a small <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> before entering the southern portion of Calliham. The road intersects Fletcher Street and continues past several houses, traveling parallel to Naylor Street for a short distance before it intersects Ritcher Street, where it bends northeastward and continues. The road passes a large RV park and intersects Deer Trail before continuing past several houses. It proceeds to its northern terminus, an intersection with Quail Run Road {{at the edge of}} Choke Canyon State Park. A long park road continues north into the park, providing access to several campgrounds and recreational areas.|$|E
5|$|The Beckwourth Trail was the {{earliest}} predecessor of SR 70, {{which was a}} spur of the California Trail. This {{was followed by the}} railroad, mostly built on the route of the trail; a <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> was needed for construction that was later converted into part of the present state highway. Construction on the highway began in 1928, which involved the boring of three tunnels. Previously, the road was signed as U.S. Route 40 Alternate, crossing the Sierra Nevada at a lower elevation than Donner Pass on US 40, now Interstate 80 (I-80). The road was renumbered SR 70 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Today, portions of SR 70 have been upgraded to a four-lane expressway, and even a freeway in a few locations.|$|E
5|$|The first {{numbered}} highway {{along the}} SR85 corridor {{was established in}} 1927 between Gila Bend and Phoenix as US80. At the time, it was only paved from Phoenix to Hassayampa. Although not paved between Hassayampa and Gila Bend, it was an improved road. This original routing of US80 still exists as Old US80 west of the SR85 alignment. A <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> between Gila Bend and Ajo did exist at this time, {{but it was not}} a part of the state highway system. By 1935, the entire route of US80 between Gila Bend and Phoenix had been paved. The road south of Gila Bend had also been improved to a gravel road.|$|E

5|$|The {{portion of}} NY292 between West Patterson and Whaley Lake {{originated}} as a <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> named the Patterson–Dutchess County Line Road. This road was reconstructed in 1919 and {{became part of}} NY39, a highway extending from Poughkeepsie to Patterson by way of West Pawling, in the 1920s. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the segment of NY39 from East Fishkill to West Patterson was incorporated into the new NY52. By {{the end of the}} 1930s, the portion of NY52 from Stormville to West Patterson was renumbered to NY216. In 1970, NY216 was truncated to its current length and NY216's former alignment from West Pawling to Patterson was renumbered to NY292.|$|E

After {{the closure of the}} branch line the buildings of the two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks, and were renamed North Bar and South Bar. On the retirement in 1956 of a Mr and Mrs Dendy, who operated North Bar from 1948 to 1956 and lived in the station apartment, North station was abandoned, and demolished in the 1960s owing to dry rot. South Bar continued to operate as a refreshment kiosk.|$|E
5|$|By 1926, the Kingsland–St. Marys highway was a sand or <b>dirt</b> <b>road.</b> When the Folkston–Kingsland {{stretch of}} SR40 reappeared on maps in February 1932, the highway was {{recorded}} as an unimproved but maintained road. SR40 was under construction along its present alignment from US17 in Kingsland {{to the south}} end of Osborne Street in St. Marys by October 1934; the highway was completed as a paved road by January 1936. The highway from Folkston to the Charlton–Camden county line was under construction by October 1936. The construction was extended east from the county line to the highway's original SR110 junction in July 1937. When construction concluded in October 1937, there was a paved highway from Folkston to the county line and a graded but otherwise unimproved highway from there to SR110. SR40 between Colerain and the western edge of Kingsland was under construction by July 1939 and paving was completed in January 1941. The gap in Kingsland was placed under construction by April 1941 but was not completed until the beginning of 1943.|$|E

5|$|By 1932, US-36 {{headed west}} from Norton toward Oberlin instead of {{southwest}} toward Selden, {{and all of}} what is K-383 became part of US-83. The entire route from Selden to Nebraska had been straightened, mostly paralleling the railroad instead of following section lines, except for through Oronoque and Jennings. US-83 was a gravel road from Selden to the NortonPhillips county line, east of which the highway remained a <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> until it was graveled in 1937. The highway was relocated straight through Jennings and to a path with fewer turns through Oronoque in 1938; that same year, the highway was paved with a bituminous surface along the US-36 concurrency. US-83 was paved from the US-36 split to the Nebraska state line in 1940. The highway was paved from Selden to Dresden by 1945 and from Dresden to US-36 west of Norton in 1948. US-383 {{was assigned to the}} entire length of the K-383 corridor and beyond in both directions by 1945.|$|E
5|$|SR76 {{then goes}} through Pala and the Pala Indian Reservation, {{providing}} access to the Pala Casino and intersecting CR S16, the turnoff to the Pala Mission and Temecula. Continuing to parallel the San Luis Rey River, SR76 passes by the Wilderness Gardens County Park before entering the community of Pauma Valley and meeting the southern terminus of CR S7 (Nate Harrison Grade), a <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> leading into Palomar Mountain State Park. SR76 intersects the southern leg of CR S6 (Valley Center Road), leading to Valley Center and Escondido. East of the small Yuima Indian Reservation, it then encounters the northern leg of CRS6, the southern approach to the Palomar Observatory and Palomar Mountain State Park, {{as well as the}} community of La Jolla Amago. It then briefly passes through the Cleveland National Forest and meets the eastern terminus of CR S7, the eastern approach to Palomar Mountain. SR76 then passes along the shores of Lake Henshaw before terminating at the intersection with SR 79 at Morettis Junction, southeast of Lake Henshaw.|$|E
5|$|The routing of SR 89A {{was first}} {{defined as a}} state highway in 1927 as SR 79 by the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT). At the time, only the portion from Prescott to Clarkdale was built, but the {{remaining}} portion to Flagstaff had been planned. By 1929, the highway had been extended north to Sedona, although the entire highway was not paved at this time. A graded <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> was built the following year between Flagstaff and Sedona. The southern half of the section between Sedona and Flagstaff had been improved to a gravel road by 1934, with the northern half under construction. The next year, the construction on the northern section near Flagstaff was complete. The {{southern end of the}} highway near Prescott and the section between Jerome and Cottonwood had been paved by this time. By 1938, the entire route had been paved.|$|E
