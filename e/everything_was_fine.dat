[...] Two of Holloway's classmates, Liz Cain and Claire Fierman, [...] "agreed that the drinking was kind of excessive." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bret {{tried to}} make amends with Owen, teaming {{with him on a}} regular basis. Bret even secured the two a shot at the WWF Tag Team Championship. They faced the Quebecers for the title at the Royal Rumble in January 1994. Initially <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> between the brothers, but when Bret hurt his knee (kayfabe) and was unable to tag Owen in {{for a long period of}} time, the younger Hart got frustrated. When the referee stopped the match due to Bret's damaged knee, Owen snapped; he kicked his brother in the knee and then walked off, berating Bret on the Titantron shortly after as Bret was being helped backstage. This started his run as a heel. After the act, an infuriated Owen accused his brother of being selfish and holding him down. Owen {{admitted}} that it felt good to take out his brother. The two brothers faced off for the first time at WrestleMania X, where Owen cleanly pinned his older brother. Later in the evening, Bret won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship while Owen stood by and watched in jealousy as Bret celebrated in the ring. Owen won the King of the Ring tournament with Jim Neidhart's help. After the victory, Owen took the nickname [...] "The King of Harts." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in 1986, Prince Pujie told Behr: [...] "Puyi constantly talked about going to England and becoming an Oxford student, like Johnston." [...] On 4June 1922, Puyi attempted {{to escape from the}} Forbidden City, having decided that {{he wanted to go to}} study at Oxford, and planned to issue an open letter to [...] "the people of China" [...] renouncing the title of Emperor before leaving for Oxford. The escape attempt failed when Johnston vetoed it and refused to call a taxi and Puyi was too frightened to live on the streets of Beijing on his own. Pujie said about Puyi’s escape attempt: “Puyi’s decision had nothing to do with the impending marriage. He felt cooped up, and wanted out.” Johnston later recounted his time as Puyi's tutor between 19191924 in his 1934 book Twilight in the Forbidden City, which is one of main sources of information about Puyi's life in this period, though Behr cautioned that Johnston painted an idealised picture of Puyi in his book, avoiding all mention of Puyi's sexuality, that he was only an average student, his erratic mood swings, and the practice of eunuch-flogging. Pujie told Behr about Puyi's moods: [...] "When he was in a good mood, <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine,</b> and he was a charming companion. If something upset him, his dark side would emerge." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{first got}} to know Corky when I came to New York. He was a pal of my cousin Gussie, who was in {{with a lot of}} people down Washington Square way. I don't know if I ever told you about it, but the reason why I left England was because I was sent over by my Aunt Agatha to try to stop young Gussie marrying a girl on the {{vaudeville}} stage, and I got the whole thing so mixed up that I decided that it would be a sound scheme for me to stop on in America for a bit instead of going back and having long cosy chats about the thing with aunt. So I sent Jeeves out to find a decent apartment, and settled down for a bit of exile. I'm bound to say that New York's a topping place to be exiled in. Everybody was awfully good to me, and there seemed to be plenty of things going on, and I'm a wealthy bird, so <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine.</b> Chappies introduced me to other chappies, and so on and so forth, and it wasn't long before I knew squads of the right sort, some who rolled in dollars in houses up by the Park, and others who lived with the gas turned down mostly around Washington Square--artists and writers and so forth. Brainy coves.|$|E
