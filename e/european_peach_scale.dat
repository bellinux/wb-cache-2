The parasitic wasp Encarsia diaspidicola (Silvestri) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) was brought from Western Samoa into a quarantine containment facility in Hawaii for evaluation and potential release against white <b>peach</b> <b>scale.</b> E. diaspidicola was considered an ideal biological control candidate for release in Hawaii because it is reportedly highly host specific. Host range testing in quarantine with several exotic diaspidids and related taxa, including a native palm scale, indicated that E. dispidicola is unlikely to attack non-target species or cause {{harm to the environment}} if released for control of white <b>peach</b> <b>scale</b> in Hawaii. The Hawaii Department of Agriculture and USDA APHIS issued permits for its release. Releases of E. diaspidicola were made beginning in February 2013 in a papaya field in Kapoho on the Big Island. Yellow sticky trap monitoring suggests that the wasp has established in the area of release. Infested papaya logs are being used to spread the wasp to new areas...|$|R

Thirteen districts were infested with harmful white peach scale; infestation was most common in parks, roadsides, private and institution gardens in centrum and old silkroad parts of Ankara. Twenty-two host plant species were found in these 13 districts, five of which (Aesculus carnea, Hibiscus sp., Paulownia tomentosa, Rhus thyphina and Salix babylonica) had not previously been recorded as host plants in Turkey. Some host plant species, including Catalpa bignonioides, Cornus alba, Fraxinus americana, F. excelsior, Forsythia intermedia, Morus alba, M. nigra and Sophora japonica, {{were found to be}} very highly infested.

Objective: The {{purpose of the present}} study was to adapt the <b>PEACH</b> <b>scale</b> into the Malay language, and to collect normative data on a group of children with normal hearing. Study sample: The participants were parents of 74 children aged between 3 months and 13 years of age. Parents were requested to observe their children's auditory/oral behavior in everyday life and to record their observations in the PEACH booklet. Results: High internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0. 93) and item-total correlation were found (0. 520. 85). Similar to the published norms for English-speaking children, near-perfect scores were achieved by Malaysian children around 40 months of age. Conclusions: The adapted version can be used to evaluate amplification for children in the Malay speaking environment. The normative curve relating age to scores for the Malay PEACH can be used as a reference against whic h functional aural/oral performance of hearing-impaired Malaysian children can be evaluated. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The white <b>peach</b> <b>scale,</b> Pseudaulacaspis pentagona (Targioni Tozzetti) (PP) is {{considered}} a main pest of peach orchards in the East Mediterranean region of Turkey. Peach is grown traditionally in the mountain area, {{but in the last}} two decades the number of peach orchards increased significantly in the coastal plains of the East Mediterranean region. PP is distributed in all peach-growing localities and heavy infestation occurs in orchards of the coastal plain. During this study two parasitoids — Encarsia berlesei (Howard) and Azotus perspeciosus (Girault) — and four predators — Cybocephalus fodori minor (Endrody-Younga), Chilocorus bipustulatus (L.), Rhyzobius lophanthae (Blaisdell) and Pharoscymnus pharoides Marseul — were found. The white <b>peach</b> <b>scale</b> occurs in Turkey on 14 host plants including several fruit trees, ornamental plants and some herbaceous plants under the canopy of heavily infested peach trees. Population fluctuations from November 1991 through November 1993 were observed at four locations representing two different ecological conditions. In the mountain area two distinct generations were recorded, the first in June/July and the second in September/October. In the coastal plain three generations were observed, the first in mid-April, the second in June/July and the third in October/November. PP population peaks are not followed by the parasitoid and predator populations, suggesting that the effectiveness of these natural enemies is not sufficient to control the pest...|$|R

40|$|Background: Highly {{polygenic}} traits such as fruit weight, {{sugar content}} and acidity strongly influence the agroeconomic value of peach varieties. Genomic Selection (GS) can accelerate peach yield and quality gain if predictions show {{higher levels of}} accuracy compared to phenotypic selection. The available IPSC 9 K SNP array V 1 allows standardized and highly reliable genotyping, preparing the ground for GS in peach. Results: A repeatability model (multiple records per individual plant) for genome-enabled predictions in eleven <b>European</b> <b>peach</b> populations is presented. The analysis included 1147 individuals derived from both commercial and non-commercial peach or peach-related accessions. Considered traits were average fruit weight (FW), sugar content (SC) and titratable acidity (TA). Plants were genotyped with the 9 K IPSC array, grown in three countries (France, Italy, Spain) and phenotyped for 3 – 5 years. An analysis of imputation accuracy of missing genotypic data was conducted using the software Beagle, showing {{that two of the}} eleven populations were highly sensitive to increasing levels of missing data. The regression model produced, for each trait and each population, estimates of heritability (FW: 0. 35, SC: 0. 48, TA: 0. 53, on average) and repeatability (FW: 0. 56, SC: 0. 63, TA: 0. 62, on average). Predictive ability was estimated in a five-fold cross validation scheme within population as the correlation of true and predicted phenotypes. Results differed by populations and traits, but predictive abilities were in general high (FW: 0. 60, SC: 0. 72, TA: 0. 65, on average). Conclusions: This study assessed the feasibility of Genomic Selection in peach for highly polygenic traits linked to yield and fruit quality. The accuracy of imputing missing genotypes was as high as 96 %, and the genomic predictive ability was on average 0. 65, but could be as high as 0. 84 for fruit weight or 0. 83 for titratable acidity. The estimated repeatability may prove very useful in the management of the typical long cycles involved in peach productions. All together, these results are very promising for the application of genomic selection to peach breeding programmes...|$|R
40|$|Pediatric audiologists lack evidence-based, age-appropriate outcome {{evaluation}} tools with well-developed normative data {{that could be}} used to evaluate the auditory development and performance of children aged birth to 6 years with permanent childhood hearing impairment. Bagatto and colleagues recommend a battery of outcome tools that may be used with this population. This article provides results of an evaluation of the individual components of the University of Western Ontario Pediatric Audiological Monitoring Protocol (UWO PedAMP) version 1. 0 by the audiologists associated with the Network of Pediatric Audiologists of Canada. It also provides information regarding barriers and facilitators to implementing outcome measures in clinical practice. Results indicate that when compared to the Parents’ Evaluation of Aural/Oral Performance of Children (PEACH) Diary, audiologists found the <b>PEACH</b> Rating <b>Scale</b> to be a more clinically feasible evaluation tool to implement in practice from a time, task, and consistency of use perspective. Results also indicate that the LittlEARS® Auditory Questionnaire could be used to evaluate the auditory development and performance of children aged birth to 6 years with permanent childhood hearing impairment (PCHI). The most cited barrier to implementation is time.

Summary and conclusions [...] References [...] Appendices. "The National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL) and the Desired Sensation Level (DSL) prescriptive procedures are often cited as the most sustainable, validated procedures and the most common methods used for hearing aid fitting in adults and in children. The overall aim {{of the present study}} is to evaluate the relative performance of the two procedures in children. The study focuses on children because they are most likely to rely on hearing aids fitted with techniques based solely on prescriptive approach. Sixteen Malaysian children with moderately severe to profound hearing loss were involved in the study. The children were fitted with the Phonak Naida V SP hearing aids based on the NAL-NL 1 and DSL v 5 prescriptive procedures. The NAL-NL 1 and DSL v 5 were the latest versions of the respective prescriptive formulae available at the time when this study was carried out. After hearing aid fitting, an extended period of hearing aid trial was given to each child. The relative performance of the two procedures was assessed using speech tests, paired-comparison judgments of speech intelligibility tests and questionnaires completed by the parents, teachers and the children themselves. The questionnaires used in the study were the Parents' Evaluation of Aural/Oral Performance of Children (PEACH), the Teachers' Evaluation of Aural/Oral Performance of Children (TEACH) and the Self Evaluation of Listening Function (SELF). The questionnaires were adapted into the Malay language. Each child also completed a short diary for them to compare the performance of the two procedures in different listening environments. The results showed a significant difference of performance between the NAL-NL 1 and DSL v 5 procedures for sentence test in quiet and for the subjective measures using questionnaires completed by the parents, teachers and children. The study concluded that the required hearing aid gain for children with moderately severe to profound hearing loss would seem to approximate the DSL v 5 prescription, at least in quiet listening environments. The findings have important clinical implications for country like Malaysia where many children with severe to profound hearing loss still rely on hearing aids as their primary amplification devices".

40|$|The {{goals of}} the current work were to: 1) {{identify}} caregiver report questionnaires for inclusion in an outcome evaluation guideline for infants, toddlers, and preschool children who wear hearing aids and 2) evaluate the chosen tools to determine their usefulness for the population of interest. A critical review of auditory-related subjective outcome evaluation tools for infants, toddlers, and preschool children is presented (Chapter 2). Good psychometric properties and clinical feasibility were considered important elements for the guideline (Andresen, 2000). Existing norms for the chosen questionnaires were validated with normal hearing children from Canadian English-speaking families (Chapters 3 and 5). Finally, The University of Western Ontario Pediatric Audiological Monitoring Protocol (UWO PedAMP), how {{it was used to}} collect clinical data with children who wear hearing aids, and their performance on the questionnaires is provided (Chapter 4). Children with comorbidities and complex factors related to hearing aid use were also investigated. The results of this work revealed two caregiver report questionnaires that were suitable for use within the UWO PedAMP (Chapter 2) : the LittlEARS® Auditory Questionnaire (Tsiakpini, et al., 2004) and the Parents’ Evaluation of Aural/Oral Performance of Children (<b>PEACH)</b> Rating <b>Scale</b> (Ching 2 ̆ 6 Hill, 2005). Both questionnaires were considered feasible for clinical use (Moodie, et al., 2011) and are supported by good psychometric properties. Norms for the questionnaires were found to be appropriate for use with normal hearing children (Chapters 3 and 5). Outcomes of children with hearing loss who wear hearing aids were investigated using the UWO PedAMP (Chapter 4). Results indicated typically developing children fitted with hearing aids displayed auditory development and performance similar to their normal hearing peers. Children with comorbidities displayed borderline normal auditory development which progressed as they got older. Children with complex factors related to hearing aid use displayed borderline normal development up to 12 months of age where it began to decline. This work also demonstrated that the UWO PedAMP {{can be used in a}} clinical setting to evaluate the outcome of hearing aid fitting to infants, toddlers, and preschool children.

40|$|The Prunus genus {{belongs to}} the Rosaceae family and {{includes}} stone fruit crops such as peach (P. persica), apricot (P. armeniaca), European plum (P. domestica), Japanese plum (P. salicina), sweet cherry (P. avium) and sour cherry (P. cerasus), as well as almond (P. dulcis), a species cultivated for its seeds. This work aims to develop simple-sequence repeat (SSR) or microsatellite markers in almond and Japanese plum, the only two diploid Prunus species lacking these markers when this thesis began, and to study their variability {{in a collection of}} cultivars of each species. In addition, we studied the transferability of the microsatellites obtained from Prunus in other cultivated rosaceous species, including six Prunus species, and three other genus: apple (Malus x domestica), pear (Pyrus comunis) and octoploid strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa). To develop new microsatellite markers, we used two methods: one from enriched DNA genomic library (for sequences CT/AG), for which we obtained 31 SSRs in almond and 27 in Japanese plum, and another using the available sequences of ESTs (expressed sequence tags) of almond (22 SSRs) and peach (25 SSRs). All these microsatellites were polymorphic in a set of eight cultivars of their respective species. We used the obtained markers in an extensive collection of almond varieties (30) to study their genetic variability using 47 microsatellites derived from this species (25 genomic and 22 derived from ESTs). A similar study was conducted in 38 varieties of Japanese plum with 27 genomic SSRs obtained in this species. These markers were highly variable in both species, with an average of 7. 3 alleles per locus in almond and 7. 2 in Japanese plum, allowing us to distinguish individually all the studied genotypes. Our data indicated that the SSRs of the same species are more variable than those developed in other related species. In addition, in almond we found that the microsatellites derived from ESTs, and particularly those located in coding regions, were less variable than those obtained from genomic sequence. The grouping of the studied varieties in function of their genetic distance (dendrogram) or their population structure was quite similar both in almond and Japanese plum. The almond varieties were grouped by their geographical origin and their flowering time, whereas the Japanese plum varieties, of recent origin and largely developed in the United States, were clustered according to the breeding programs of the different States they were obtained. A total of 145 Prunus SSRs [25 genomic from almond, peach and Japanese plum, 25 ESTs derived from peach, 22 ESTs derived from almond and 23 derived from apricot (10 genomic and 13 from ESTs) ] were chosen to study transferability, all polymorphic and identifying a single locus in the origin species. These microsatellites were studied in eight varieties of the following nine species: almond, <b>peach,</b> <b>European</b> plum, Japanese plum, apricot, sweet cherry, apple, pear and strawberry. Eighty-three percent (83 %) of these markers amplified bands of the expected size in the other Prunus species and 63. 9 % were polymorphic, indicating the high transferability within this genus. This transferability decreased as the genetic distance between the species origin of the SSR and the studied species increased. Thus, only 16. 3 % of the tested SSRs were transferable to species of other rosaceous genera (apple, pear and strawberry). No significant differences were detected between microsatellites of different origins (genomic and ESTs) regarding their transferability, nor their capacity to detect variability. From the studied SSRs, 31 amplified and were polymorphic in all tested Prunus species. Twelve, selected to cover the whole genome, were proposed as the universal set for the analysis of variability in Prunus...|$|R
