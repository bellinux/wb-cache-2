40|$|According to the face-spiral conjecture, {{first made}} in {{connection}} with enumeration of fullerenes, a cubic polyhedron can be reconstructed from a face sequence starting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>face</b> and adding faces sequentially in spiral fashion. This conjecture {{is known to be}} false, both for general cubic polyhedra and within the specific class of fullerenes. Here we report counterexamples to the spiral conjecture within the 19 classes of cubic polyhedra with positive curvature, i. e., with no face size larger than six. The classes are defined by triples {p (3), p (4), p (5) } where p (3), p (4) and p (5) are the respective numbers of triangular, tetragonal and pentagonal faces. In this notation, fullerenes are the class { 0, 0, 12 }. For 11 classes, the reported examples have minimum vertex number, but for the remaining 8 classes the examples are not guaranteed to be minimal. For cubic graphs that also allow faces of size larger than 6, counterexamples are common and occur early; we conjecture that every infinite class of cubic polyhedra described by allowed and forbidden face sizes contains non-spiral elements...|$|E

Feeling confident after his earlier double century against the tourists Nurse hit Statham for a boundary <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> ball he <b>faced.</b> In what {{was described as a}} [...] "sparkling" [...] innings Nurse made 70 runs before lofting the England off spinner Ray Illingworth to mid on where he was caught by M. J. K. Smith. Commenting on the dismissal some years later, Nurse said, [...] "Inexperience got the better of me. I could have had an easy hundred, but that's life." [...] Nurse made 11 in the second innings but was omitted for the next Test when fellow Barbadian Clyde Walcott was recalled to the team.|$|R
40|$|In eukaryotes, gene {{expression}} depends on chromatin organization. However, how chromatin affects the transcription dynamics of individual RNA polymerases has remained elusive. Here, we use dual trap optical tweezers to study single yeast RNA polymerase II (Pol II) molecules transcribing along a DNA template with two nucleosomes. The slowdown {{and the changes}} in pausing behavior within the nucleosomal region allow us to determine a drift coefficient, χ, which characterizes {{the ability of the}} enzyme to recover from a nucleosomal backtrack. Notably, χ can be used to predict the probability to pass <b>the</b> <b>first</b> nucleosome. Importantly, <b>the</b> presence of a second nucleosome changes χ in a manner that depends on the spacing between the two nucleosomes, as well as on their rotational arrangement on the helical DNA molecule. Our results indicate that the ability of Pol II to pass <b>the</b> <b>first</b> nucleosome is increased when the next nucleosome is turned away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> one to <b>face</b> <b>the</b> opposite side of the DNA template. These findings help to rationalize how chromatin arrangement affects Pol II transcription dynamics...|$|R
500|$|Australia lost an {{unofficial}} Test series to a Rest of the World {{team led by}} Gary Sobers that toured in 1971–72 {{as a replacement for}} the politically unacceptable South Africans. Chappell was the outstanding batsman of the series, with four centuries included in his 634 runs, at an average of 79.25. He took the team to England in 1972 and was unlucky not to regain The Ashes in a rubber that ended 2–2. The series began disastrously for Chappell when he was out hooking <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> ball he <b>faced</b> in the opening Test at Manchester. He fell the same way in the second innings and Australia lost the match. However, the team regrouped and had the better of the remaining matches, apart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fourth Test at Leeds, played on a controversial pitch that the Australians believed was [...] "doctored" [...] to suit the England team. Greg Chappell emerged as a prolific batsman during the series, batting one place below his brother in the order. The siblings shared several crucial partnerships, most notably 201 at the Oval in the last Test when they became <b>the</b> <b>first</b> brothers to score centuries in the same Test innings. Australia won the game, an effort that Chappell later cited as the turning point in the team's performances.|$|R
500|$|After his {{performances}} in the AHL, Hextall was invited to the Flyers' training camp as a long-shot. His play in four exhibition games convinced Flyers' coach Mike Keenan to call up Hextall to the NHL, and to play him in the opening game of the season, against the Edmonton Oilers. Hextall conceded a goal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> shot he <b>faced</b> in the game, but allowed no further shots past him, leading his side to a 2–1 victory. Hextall continued to display the aggressive nature with which he had always played, swinging his stick at Brad Smith and Troy Murray early in his first NHL season. Despite these swipes, Hextall claimed at the time that, [...] "I used to be worse, I've learned to control my temper." [...] Two months after making these comments, Hextall {{was involved in a}} fight with opposing New Jersey Devils goaltender Alain Chevrier. Having lost to the Devils, the Flyers wanted revenge for Steve Richmond's punch on Kjell Samuelsson {{at the end of the}} game; Hextall targeted Chevrier in a fight labelled by Chico Resch as [...] "like a heavyweight against a lightweight." [...] Hextall and seven other players were fined $300 each for their part in the brawl.|$|R
