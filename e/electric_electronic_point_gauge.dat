40|$|In {{this paper}} both a {{microwave}} attenuation measurement along a horizontal line and multiple <b>point</b> <b>gauge</b> measurements are analyzed as possible ground-truth designs to validate satellite precipitation retrieval algorithms {{at the field}} of view spatial level (typically about 20 km). The design consists of comparing a sequence of pairs of contemporaneous measurements taken from the ground and from space. The authors examine theoretically the variance of expected differences between the two systems. The line average measurement leads to a smaller mean-square error compared to the case of a single <b>point</b> <b>gauge,</b> since some of the small-scale variability of the rain field is smoothed away by the line integration. The multiple <b>point</b> <b>gauge</b> measurements also give smaller mean-square error than that of a single <b>point</b> <b>gauge.</b> The centroid of the line and <b>point</b> <b>gauge</b> configurations are considered to be located randomly inside {{the field of view}} for different overpasses. A space-time spectral formalism is used with a noise-forced diffusive rain field to find the mean-square error. By considering instantaneous ground and satellite measurement pairs over about 50 visits when raining, we can reduce the expected error to approximately 10 % of the standard deviation of climatological variability. This {{is considered to be a}} useful level of tolerance for identifying biases in the retrieval algorithms. It is found that the multiple <b>point</b> <b>gauges</b> (especially two gauges) are the economical ground-truth design compared to the microwave attenuation based on the mean-square error comparison. The major finding of this study is that a significant improvement over the <b>point</b> <b>gauge</b> is obtained by adding a single additional piece of information; adding more gauges or extending the line of attenuation is not an important improvement...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the impact of output and {{employment}} generation due to fluctuations in net trade for <b>electric</b> and <b>electronic</b> products during the period 1991 – 2001. The results show the significant contribution of <b>electric</b> and <b>electronic</b> industry not only for the Malaysian GDP, export, and employment, but also for its inter-industrial relationship in the manufacturing sectors. Decreased net trade for <b>electric</b> and <b>electronic</b> products have resulted in declining output and employment generation especially in 1994 and 2000. This paper also attempts to present the impact on various categories of workers based on the skill levels due to the decline in the net trade for <b>electric</b> and <b>electronic</b> products. The results demonstrate that skilled workers are the most affected category, which is due to the high intensity level of skilled workers in this sector...|$|R
