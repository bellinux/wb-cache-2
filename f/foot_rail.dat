In the corridor in front of Brayton's chamber he met some servants who had come from the upper floor. Together they rushed at the door without knocking. It was unfastened and gave way.

50|$|Holdup alarms are alarms {{that require}} a person under duress to covertly trigger the alarm to summon the proper authorities. These types of alarms are most {{commonly}} found in retail establishments and financial institutions, but are sometimes an integrated feature of home burglar alarms. The trigger could be a push button, electronic money clip, a <b>foot</b> <b>rail,</b> or {{a number of other}} things. Either the person under duress or a witness can activate this kind of alarm. For example, if someone is ambushed outside of their home and told to disable their alarm system they can possibly enter a special duress code that is different from their normal deactivation code to notify authorities without arousing suspicion. These alarms are almost always silent and usually require a manual reset with a key or a special code.|$|E

50|$|The {{wheelbase}} {{also affects}} the load the vehicle poses {{to the track}}, track infrastructure and bridges.

As railway lines are designed to take a pre-determined maximum load per unit of length (tonnes per meter, or pounds per <b>foot),</b> the <b>rail</b> vehicles' wheelbase is designed according to their intended gross weight. The higher the gross weight, the longer the wheelbase must be.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} train track through Irwindale {{were built}} by the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad. The Gold line uses the old right of way of the The Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad who built the first train tracks through Irwindale in 1887. The Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad was founded in 1883, by James F. Crank {{with the goal of}} bringing a rail line to San Gabriel Valley from downtown Los Angeles. Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad was sold on May 20, 1887 into the California Central Railway. In 1889 the rail line was consolidated into Southern California Railway Company. On Jan. 17, 1906 Southern California Railway was sold to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and called the Pasadena Subdivision. Amtrak-Santa Fe ran the Southwest Chief and Desert Wind over this line through Irwindale, but relocated the Desert Wind to the Fullerton Line in 1986. The Santa Fe line served the San Gabriel Valley until 1994, when the 1994 Northridge earthquake weakened the bridge in Arcadia and the track was closed till the Gold line was built. The rail line crosses the San Gabriel River on a long girder bridge, then passes through the Santa Fe Dam Recreation Area (how it received it name). The rail line intersected {{the north end of the}} former SP Azusa Industrial Track at Irwindale (MP 118.2). Irwindale had a 6,165 <b>foot</b> <b>rail</b> siding that passed the Miller Brewing Company's Irwindale brewery. From there the tracks continued and crossed beneath Irwindale Avenue.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. I {{conducted}} an analysis {{to determine the}} ergonomic stressors placed on an employee during a grinding operation. A review of a videotape filmed of the operation indicated that the employee's discomfort was probably related to the low work surface height, the abduction of the right shoulder, and the pronated grip used to hold the grinding tool. In order to improve the employee's posture, the following changes were suggested: 1. Raise the workbench to a height of 36 inches and enable the employee to tilt the work surface forward if desired. 2. Install a <b>foot</b> <b>rail</b> to reduce the static load on the legs 3. Instruct the employee to use a neutral power grip when holding the grinder to reduce the strain on the wrist and elbow tendons. 4. Eliminate the need to hold the right arm in an abducted position. 5.

40|$|When Merle Thornton and Ro Bognor chained {{themselves}} to the <b>foot</b> <b>rail</b> of the front bar of Brisbane’s Regatta Hotel in March 1965 to demand the legal right for women in that state to drink alongside male patrons, their actions marked a new turn {{in the history of}} feminism. As Kay Saunders observed three decades later: ‘when you use the term ‘‘second wave’’ it actually started in Brisbane’ (Saunders 1999). In a leaflet distributed in the bar that day, the two women were at pains to articulate that their primary concern was not with the exclusion of women from drinking opportunities; they were concerned with what the legislation symbolised: women’s wider exclusion from public spaces and from public life. They were staging a protest for equal citizenship, a demand that underpinned much of Thornton’s subsequent career as a feminist activist. As she later recalled: ‘What we did at the Regatta represented an idea whose time had come. It was the idea of ending the confinement of women to the private domestic sphere’ (Thornton 2007, 51). We have recently completed a project focused on securing Thornton’s personal papers for the National Library of Australia (NLA). Our desire to undertake this project was driven by recognition that the conditions of possibility for researching the history of Australia’s second-wave women’s movement and, in particular, accounts of the role of activists within it are determined in no small part by the movement’s archival legacy. Her papers represent a valuable addition to the current records of that movement, not least in how they document early grassroots feminist activism taking place outside the more familiar south-eastern axis of Sydney Canberra Melbourne. The project was undertaken with the assistance of Marie-Louise Ayres and Emma Jolley of the NLA, with a consultant archivist, Jane Ellen, and with financial support from the Sidney Myer Fund and the Office of the Queensland Premier. In this respect, it was a model of what converging scholarly, institutional and philanthropic interests can sometimes achieve. The project saw Thornton’s papers professionally processed and boxed in situ at her Melbourne home and a descriptive box listing produced. In addition, we recorded an oral history interview with Thornton for inclusion in the NLA’s collection. When Thornton completes her current work a memoir the papers will be released to the Library...|$|E
