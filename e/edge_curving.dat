40|$|Summary. Extensive {{tables are}} given of {{pressure}} coefficients measured at Reynolds numbers from 1. 3 x l 0 G to 3 " 9 x 106 on two half-models of identical planform with 5 ~ RAE 101 and 9 ~ RAE 101 streamwise sections. The planform of aspect ratio 3 ' 899 has a straight trailing edge with 60 ° of sweepback, constant chord {{over most of}} the span and a parabolic outer portion of the leading <b>edge</b> <b>curving</b> to a pointed tip. The overall wing characteristics are obtained from integrated normal pressures and are compared with lifting-surface theory. The low-speed experimental pressure distributions and surface oil-flow patterns are analysed and discussed in relation to the onset of separation and the distinct vortex flows that develop at high incidence. Series of contrasting upper-surface isobars illustrate some features of the different stalling processes of the two wings. The direct influence of the main vortex on local surface pressures is assessed in general terms. A fuller appraisal of secondary surface flow is obtained from the oil patterns, observations in water and measurements of high suctigr ~ near the trailing edge. Studies of the extent of leading-edge stall and location of part-span vortices, in particular two simultaneous leading-edge vortices on the thinner wing, follow from further analysis of local surface pressures. After a 'detailed discussion of the effect of Reynolds number and the distinct types of separated flow, a few results with leading-edge roughness are considered in relation to scale effect on separation and the extensive influence of part-span roughness. 1.

In particular, we prove that a strongly connected graph is RUP {{if and only if}} its dual is a SUP dipole. A dipole is an acyclic graph with a single source and a single sink.

40|$|A robust {{approach}} for automatically extracting roads from overhead images is developed in this paper. The first step involves extracting a very dense set of edge pixels using a technique {{based on the}} magnitude and direction of pixel gradients. In step two, the edges are separated into successive channels of edge orientation that each contain edge pixels whose gradient directions lie within a different angular range. A de-cluttered map of <b>edge</b> <b>curve</b> segments is extracted from each channel, {{and the results are}} merged into a single composite map of broken <b>edge</b> <b>curves.</b> The final step divides broken curves into segments that are nearly linear and classifies each segment as connected at both ends or disconnected. A measure of connectability between two disconnected line segments based on proximity and relative alignment is defined mathematically. Each disconnected segment is paired with the disconnected segment that it is most connectable to. Pairs of segments are merged if their separation and misalignment are below thresholds (manually specified at present) and the connectability of the pair is two-way optimal. Extended curve and road extraction examples are provided using commercial overhead images...|$|R

We consider an initial implicitly defined surface, which is represented as the zero set of a C 1 smooth scalar field with non–vanishing gradients. In order to represent sharp edges and vertices, this surface is augmented by adding {{new types of}} implicit representations, called edge descriptors and vertex descriptors. They are defined {{with the help of}} the distance field of <b>edge</b> <b>curves.</b> In our implementation, we use circular splines to describe these <b>edge</b> <b>curves,</b> since they support a fast and non-iterative closest point computation. After adding the edge and vertex descriptors to the initial scalar field, the zero set of the augmented function contains the sharp features. We apply the new representation to surface modelling by implicitly defined surfaces with sharp features and to object reconstruction. In the latter case we describe an algorithm for detecting the sharp curves and vertices of a shape which is given by an unorganized point cloud, which are then approximated by circular splines, in order to define the edge and vertex descriptors...|$|R
