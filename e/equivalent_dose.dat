5|$|Upon {{receiving}} notification, the OAEP {{sent two}} officers to investigate, {{who met the}} doctors and patients at the hospital shortly after noon on 18 February. After questioning the scrapyard owner, they searched for the cylindrical metal pieces initially suspected to be the radiation source, but found {{that they were not}} radioactive. They then headed to the scrapyard, and noted abnormally high levels of radiation as they approached, late in the evening. At the scrapyard entrance they measured radiation at an <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> of 1 millisievert per hour (mSv/h) and decided to request additional assistance.|$|E
5|$|Withdrawal is best {{managed by}} {{transferring}} the physically dependent patient to an <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> of diazepam {{because it has}} the longest half-life {{of all of the}} benzodiazepines, is metabolised into long-acting active metabolites and is available in low-potency tablets, which can be quartered for smaller doses. A further benefit is that it is available in liquid form, which allows for even smaller reductions. Chlordiazepoxide, which also has a long half-life and long-acting active metabolites, can be used as an alternative.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol ester prodrug with L-pyroglutamic acid (PCA), a biosynthetic {{precursor}} of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve bioavailability. The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of {{an overdose of}} paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> of paracetamol showed a significative decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral LD50 {{was found to be}} greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.|$|E

5|$|Without the {{protection}} of the Earth's atmosphere, cosmonauts were exposed to higher levels of radiation from a steady flux of cosmic rays and trapped protons from the South Atlantic Anomaly. The station's crews were exposed to an absorbed dose of about 5.2cGy {{over the course of a}} 115-day expedition, producing an <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> of 14.75cSv, or 1133ÂµSv per day. This daily dose is approximately that received from natural background radiation on Earth in two years. The radiation environment of the station was not uniform; closer proximity to the station's hull led to an increased radiation dose, and the strength of radiation shielding varied between modules; Kvant-2's being better than the core module, for instance.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are used}} recreationally and by {{problematic}} drug misusers. Mortality is higher among poly-drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly-drug users. Dependence and tolerance, often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; withdrawal syndrome may appear after {{as little as}} three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use {{has the potential to}} cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of panic attacks), and agoraphobia. Benzodiazepines and, in particular, temazepam are sometimes used intravenously, which, if done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including abscesses, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, arterial puncture, deep vein thrombosis, and gangrene. Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. Benzodiazepines are also misused intranasally, which may have additional health consequences. Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established, a clinician usually converts the patient to an <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> of diazepam before beginning a gradual reduction program.|$|E

The greater rigidity of dydrogesterone also positively affects its selectivity, while natural progesterone is less selective, existing in different conformations that more easily bind to different receptors. As a consequence of its better bioavailability and the progestational activity of its main metabolites (20-, 21- and 16-hydroxy derivatives), the <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> of dydrogesterone is 10â20 times {{lower than that of}} oral micronized progesterone.|$|E
25|$|On , {{during the}} yearly {{revision}} of Beznau 2, two workers {{were exposed to}} excessive levels of radiation because {{of a series of}} organizational flaws and uncoordinated handling by another revision team.

25|$|An {{explosion}} {{was heard}} after 06:14 JST on 15 March in Unit 2, possibly damaging the pressure-suppression system, {{which is at}} the bottom part of the containment vessel. The radiation level was reported to exceed the legal limit and the plant's operator started to evacuate all non-essential workers from the plant. Only a minimum crew of 50 men, also referred to as the Fukushima 50, was left at the site. Soon after, radiation <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> rates had risen to 8.2 mSv/h around two hours after the explosion and again down to 2.4 mSv/h, shortly after.

25|$|Dydrogesterone is {{a highly}} {{selective}} progestogen, and due to its unique structure, unlike progesterone and many other progestins, binds almost exclusively to the progesterone receptor (PR). The affinity of dydrogesterone for the PR is relatively low at about 16% of that of progesterone. However, in vivo, dydrogesterone is much more potent in comparison, with an <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose,</b> in terms of endometrial proliferation, that is 10 to 20 times {{lower than that of}} progesterone. This is due to pharmacokinetic differences between the two drugs, namely improved bioavailability and metabolic stability with dydrogesterone as well as additional progestogenic activity of its metabolites. Although dydrogesterone binds to both isoforms of the PR and has similar activity as an agonist of the PRB as progesterone, its agonistic activity is weak {{in the case of the}} PRA. Hence, dydrogesterone shows selectivity for activation of the PRB. This could potentially confer a therapeutic advantage, as the two receptor isoforms induce different physiological responses in target tissues.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "tentative" [...] {{estimate}} of the doses involved was made in 1948, based on dozens of assumptions, {{some of which are}} now known to be grossly incorrect. In the absence of personal dosimetry badges, the study authors relied on measurements of sodium activation in the victims' blood and urine samples as their primary source of data. This activation would have been caused by neutron radiation, but they converted all doses to equivalent doses of gamma or X-ray radiation. They concluded that Daghlian and Slotin had probably received doses equivalent to 290 and 880 rem (respectively) of gamma rays. Minimum and maximum estimates varied from about 50% to 200% of these values. The authors also calculated doses equivalent to a mix of soft 80keV X-rays and gamma rays, which they believed gave a more realistic picture of the exposure than the gamma equivalent. In this model the equivalent X-ray doses were much higher, but would be concentrated in the tissues facing the source, whereas the gamma component penetrated the whole body. Slotin's <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> was estimated to be 1930R (roentgen) of X-ray with 114R of gamma, while Daghlian's <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> was estimated to be 480R of X-ray with 110R of gamma.
