5000|$|In February 1946, the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations helped {{draft the}} {{constitution}} of the new body. The draft constitution began to be signed by representative of 61 countries in June 1946, to come into force when ratified by 26 countries. Until that happened, an <b>Interim</b> <b>Commission</b> of 18 countries would prepare. The use of the word [...] "world", rather than [...] "international", emphasised the truly global nature of what the organization was seeking to achieve. The constitution of WHO was developed from four documents, submitted by the French, British, United States and Yugoslav governments. There was a common consensus that membership should not be limited to members of the United Nations and to this effect other countries were allowed to send observers to the drafting process. The International Health Conference met between 19 June and 22 July 1946, attended by representatives of all 51 members of the UN, 13 non-member countries, 3 Allied Commission and 10 international organizations. Dr. Thomas Parran {{served as president of the}} conference. The two most discussed issues were the role of the Soviet Union (which accepted a place) and the integration of other international organizations, which was agreed and would be managed. The constitution of the World Health Organization had been signed by all 61 countries by 22 July 1946, which an article in Science described as [...] "an historic day". It thus became the first specialised agency of the United Nations to which every member subscribed. Its constitution formally came into force on the first World Health Day on 7 April 1948, when it was ratified by the 26th member state. The transfer was authorized by a Resolution of the General Assembly. The Office International d'Hygiène Publique was incorporated into the <b>Interim</b> <b>Commission</b> of the World Health Organization on 1 January 1947.|$|E

Countries that were not yet members {{attended}} as observers, along with the Allied Control Authorities for Germany, Japan and Korea. The conference voted to accept the constitution as presented in the draft submitted by the TPC, with only relatively minor changes. Other important decisions were made in New York. Among them, an <b>Interim</b> <b>Commission</b> (IC) {{was set up to}} “make preparations for the First World Health Assembly, to carry on without interruption the surviving activities of the League of Nations Health Organization and those of the Office International d’Hygieve Publique (OIHP) and UNRRA, and to perform other urgent duties pending the final establishment of the Organization.” ...|$|E
