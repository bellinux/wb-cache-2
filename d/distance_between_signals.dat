40|$|Abstract — Deterministic timed {{systems can}} be modeled as fixed point {{problems}} [15], [16], [4]. In particular, any connected network of timed {{systems can be}} modeled as a single system with feedback, and the system behavior is the fixed point of the corresponding system equation, when it exists. For delta-causal systems, {{we can use the}} Cantor metric to measure the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>signals</b> and the Banach fixed-point theorem to prove the existence and uniqueness of a system behavior. Moreover, the Banach fixed-point theorem is constructive: it provides a method to construct the unique fixed point through iteration. In this paper, we extend this result to systems modeled with the superdense model of time [7], [8] used in hybrid systems. We call the systems we consider eventually delta-causal, a strict generalization of delta-causal in which multiple events may be generated on a signal in zero time. With this model of time, we can use a generalized ultrametric [14] instead of a metric to model the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>signals.</b> The existence and uniqueness of behaviors for such systems comes from the fixedpoint theorem of [13], but this theorem gives no constructive method to compute the fixed point. This leads us to define petrics, a generalization of metrics, which we use to generalize the Banach fixed-point theorem to provide a constructive fixed-point theorem. This new fixedpoint theorem allows us to construct the unique behavior of eventually delta-causal systems. I...|$|E

By exploiting the spectral representation of Toeplitz matrices, the proposed distance measure is defined {{based on an}} optimal mass transport problem in the spectral domain.

The proposed distance measure is also shown to be contractive with respect to both additive and multiplicative noise, and thereby allows for a quantification of the decreased <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>signals</b> when these are corrupted by noise. Finally, we illustrate how this approach {{can be used for}} several applications in signal processing.

The long-standing strong simplex conjecture, which postulates that the regular simplex signal set maximizes {{the probability of}} correct detection under an average-energy constraint, is disproven. A signal set is presented that performs better than the regular simplex signal set at low signal-to-noise ratios for all M 2 7. This leads to the result that, for all M 2 7, there is no signal set of M signals which is optimal at all signal-to-noise ratios. Furthermore, the optimal signal set at low signal-to-noise ratios is not an equal energy set for any iM 2 7. The regular simplex is shown to be the unique signal set which maximizes the mini-mum <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>signals.</b> It follows that a signal set which maximizes the minimum distance is not necessarily optimum. However, the regular simplex is shown to be globally optimum {{in the sense of}} uniquely maximizing the union bound on error probability at all signal-to-noise ratios.

Denoting the minimal L 2 norm over the interval (−δ, δ) by I(δ), it is trivial by the orthogonality of the exponentials that I(12) is 1. The main result of the paper is to show that there is a neighborhood of half for which I(δ) is 1, despite the non-orthogonality of the exponentials in the interval (−δ, δ). The origin of this problem, arises from certain basic problems in data communications, concerned with studying the behavior of the minimum L 2 <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>signals,</b> when data is sent faster than the Nyquist rate over an ideal bandlimited channel.

Solutions proposed to the problem in the literature generally invoke homomorphic encryption schemes, secure multi-party computation, or other cryptographic methods which introduce significant computational complexity into the proceedings, often to the point of making more complex computations requiring repeated computations unfeasible. Other solutions invoke third parties, making unrealistic assumptions about their trustworthiness. In this paper we propose an alternate approach, also based on third party computation, but without assuming as much trust in the third party. Individual participants to the computation "secure" their data through a proposed secure hashing scheme with shared keys, prior to sharing it with the third party. The hashing ensures that the third party cannot recover any information about the individual signals or their statistics, either from analysis of individual computations or their long-term aggregate patterns.

They vary in using vehicle’s control devices such as the steering wheel, pedals, gears etc. In this thesis, we analyze driving behavior in different timeframes prior to turns. We employ data obtained from actual driving behavior in an urban environment collected from the CAN-Bus of an instrumented vehicle. Five CAN-Bus signals, vehicle speed, gas pedal pressure, brake pedal pressure, steering wheel angle, and acceleration, is collected for 5, 10, and 15 seconds of driving prior to each turn. We consider all turns for each driver as well as look specifically and right and left turns. We use cluster analysis {{to see if we}} can categorize drivers into possible groups of driving styles. In our first approach, we use hierarchical clustering on statistical features extracted from the signals.

The traditional techniques do not account for such noise and, consequently, cannot provide a robust classification of signals. We apply a recent framework that: (1) uses a distance-based objective function for data alignment and noise reduction, and (2) leads to warping-invariant <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>signals</b> for robust clustering and classification. We use this framework to introduce two distances {{that can be used}} for signal classification: (a) a y-distance, which is the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the aligned <b>signals,</b> and (b) an x-distance that measures the amount of warping needed to align the signals. We focus on the task of clustering and classifying objects, using acoustic spectrum (acoustic-color), which is complicated by the uncertainties in aspect angles at data collections. Small changes in the aspect angles corrupt signals in a way that amounts to compositional noise.

In this paper, we explore a quadratic alternative to entropic regularization for transport over a graph. We theoretically analyze the behavior of quadratically-regularized graph transport, characterizing how regularization affects the structure of flows in the regime of small but nonzero regularization. We further exploit elegant second-order structure in the dual of this problem to derive an easily-implemented Newton-type optimization algorithm. Comment: 27 page...|$|R
