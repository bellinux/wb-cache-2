Some generalizations of classical models are presented in order to check the critical conditions both {{in the case of}} flutter and divergence for long-span bridges with particular reference to the cable-stayed scheme. Furthermore, a numerical model based on a finite volume formulation of the flow problem around the girder cross-section is developed, able to simulate the steady and non-steady wind load conditions on the bridge.

40|$|Abstract: The {{presence}} of shoreline undulations along the Atlantic coast of Fire Island, NY requires careful consideration in developing erosion control and hurricane protection plans and design alternatives {{for the protection}} of the Fire Island barrier and the Long Island mainland. An analysis and geometric characterization of these morphologic shoreline features revealed that the magnitude of the shoreline undulations approximates typical protective berm design widths and exceeds typical advance nourishment beach widths. Because shoreline undulations are natural morphologic features of the Fire Island shoreline their presence after project construction must be anticipated. Conclusions drawn from the analysis of the Fire Island shoreline undulations indicate that the design berm width could be compromised well before scheduled renourishment if explicit consideration of shoreline undulations is not included in the development of the <b>design</b> <b>cross-section...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{two approaches}} to serviceability limit state (SLS) verification for the deep excavation boundary value problem. The verification {{is carried out}} {{by means of the}} finite element (FE) method with the aid of the commercial program ZSoil v 2014. In numerical simulations, deep excavation in non-cohesive soil is supported with a diaphragm wall. In the first approach, the diaphragm wall is modeled with the Hookean material assuming reduced average stiffness and possible concrete cracking. The second approach is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the wall is modeled by defining its stiffness with the highest nominal Young’s modulus. The modulus makes it possible to find design bending moments which are used to compute the minimal <b>design</b> <b>cross-section</b> reinforcement for the retaining structure. The computed reinforcement is then used in a non-linear structural analysis which is viewed as the “actual” SLS verification...|$|E
40|$|Currently, for tunnels, {{the design}} {{centerline}} and <b>design</b> <b>cross-section</b> with time stamps {{are used for}} dynamic three-dimensional (3 D) modeling. However, this approach cannot correctly reflect some qualities of tunneling or some special cases, such as landslips. Therefore, a dynamic 3 D model of a tunnel based on spatiotemporal data from survey cross-sections is proposed in this paper. This model can not only playback the excavation process but also reflect qualities of a project typically missed. In this paper, a new conceptual model for dynamic 3 D modeling of tunneling survey data is introduced. Some specific solutions are proposed using key corresponding technologies for coordinate transformation of cross-sections from linear engineering coordinates to global projection coordinates, data structure of files and database, and dynamic 3 D modeling. A 3 D tunnel TIN model was proposed using the optimized minimum direction angle algorithm.

40|$|The recent {{emergence}} of hot-rolled elliptical hollow sections (EHS) within {{the construction industry}} has attracted considerable interest from structural engineers and architects. Comprehensive structural design rules are now required to facilitate their wider application. This paper focuses on the bending strength of hot-rolled elliptical hollow sections; the results of detailed experimental and numerical studies are presented and structural design rules for EHS in bending about the {{major and minor axes}} are proposed. A total of 18 in-plane bending tests in three-point and four-point configurations have been performed. All tested specimens had an aspect ratio of two. Full moment-rotation and moment-curvature histories were derived, including into the post-ultimate range. The experimental results were replicated by means of non-linear numerical modelling. Following careful validation of the models, parametric studies were performed to assess the structural response of EHS over a wider range of aspect ratios (between one (CHS) and three) and cross-section slendernesses. For <b>design,</b> <b>cross-section</b> slenderness parameters have been proposed and a set of classification limits in harmony with those given in Eurocode 3 for circular hollow sections (CHS) has been derived. A new Class 3 limit has also been proposed for both EHS and CHS. An interim effective section modulus formula for Class 4 (slender) elliptical hollow sections based on BS 5950 - 1 has also been developed. Further investigation into effective section modulus formulations is currently underway. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. ...|$|E

In both {{the black and white}} population groups 29 % of the participants were constipated according to the definition used in this study. Depression was a risk factor for constipation in both population groups. Age over 80 years was a risk factor in the black participants. The fibre and fluid contents of participants ' diets were not found to be associated with constipation. Pain during defaecation was positively associated with constipation. Forty-three per cent of the white and 76. 6 % of the black participants used laxatives. Of the white and black laxative users 14. 3 % and 21. 5 %, respectively, used more than one laxative at a time. Conclusion. The prevalence of constipation was high in both groups. Laxative use and abuse are very common in the black elderly population. 5 Afr Med J 1998; 88 : 88 &- 890.

40|$|Climate {{adaptation}} for coastal {{infrastructure projects}} raises unique challenges because global-scale environmental changes may require similar projects {{to be completed}} in many locations over the same time frame. Existing methods to forecast resource demand and capacity do not consider this phenomenon of a global change affecting many localities and the resulting increased demand for resources. Current methods do not relate to the most up-to-date climate science information, and they are too costly or too imprecise to generate global, regional, and local forecasts of “climate-critical resources” that will be required for infrastructure protection. They either require too much effort to create the many localized designs or are too coarse to consider information sources about local conditions and structure-specific engineering knowledge. We formalized the concept of a “minimum assumption credible design” (MACD) to leverage available local information (topography/bathymetry and existing infrastructure) and the essential engineering knowledge and required construction materials (i. e., a <b>design</b> <b>cross-section</b> template). The aggregation of the resources required for individual local structures then forecasts the resource demand for global adaptation projects. We illustrate the application of the MACD method to estimate the demand for construction materials critical to protect seaports from sea-level-rise-enhanced storm surges. We examined 221 of the world’s 3, 300 + seaports to calculate the resource requirements for a coastal storm surge protection structure suited to current upper-bound projections of two meters of sea level rise by 2100. We found that a project of this scale would require approximately 436 million cubic meters of construction materials, including cement, sand, aggregate, steel rebar, and riprap. For cement alone, ∼ 49 million metric tons would be required. The deployment of the MACD method would make resource forecasts for adaptation projects more transparent and widely accessible and would highlight areas where current engineering knowledge or material, engineering workforce, and equipment capacity fall short of meeting the demands of adaptation projects...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the stress {{distributions}} of NiTi rotary instruments based on their cross-sectional geometries of triangular shape-based cross-sectional design, S-shaped cross-sectional design and modified rectangular shape-based one using 3 D FE models.

40|$|AbstractDirect and inverse {{problems}} of a fracture mechanics based RC beam model are solved. Solution of the direct problem that maps crack bridging stresses into crack opening displacements (COD) is straightforward, but the inverse problem is ill-posed, and better solved by the theory of inverse problems. This paper exploits the Tikhonov regularization method to solve the inverse problem, and estimates the force and location of rebar in buried concrete from CODs. Bending tests are carried out on model RC beams in the laboratory to demonstrate {{the applicability of the}} method. During the tests, a microscopic camera snaps high resolution digital pictures of cracked concrete surface. The images are analyzed by a software to measure surface CODs that are input into the inverse problem. The practical CODs inevitably include noise due to experimental error, which makes the inverse problem ill-posed, and necessitates regularization. In the current inverse analysis by the Tikhonov regularization method, bridging stress profiles, i. e. variation of the crack bridging stress along the crack length, has been figured out. Results are compared with those from other theoretical methods of analysis {{as well as with the}} readings from strain gauges.
