40|$|In {{modern and}} future radar {{applications}} there are high {{demands on the}} signal processing chain in terms of computational power and generality. At the same time, there are <b>hard</b> <b>size</b> and power consumption constraints. This paper reports on a project whose aim {{is to find a}} good scalable computer architecture that is flexible, programmable and as general-purpose as possible without too much performance loss. The proposed architecture consists of multiple SIMD computing modules, each based on a number of small mesh arrays. The modules are fully programmable and work globally as a MIMD machine and locally as SIMD machines. The data network is modular and provides both high bandwidth capacity and fast response. It has a fiber-optic stars topology, and employs time and wavelength division multiplexing, together with a medium access method specially developed for real-time systems. In this paper, we use a radar system with 64 processing channels to illustrate the algorithms and the usage of the processor modules. We show {{that it is possible to}} use a machine, consisting of small mesh processor arrays forming larger modules, with good efficiency. The building blocks show good balance between computational power and I/O bandwidth, and the SIMD approach seems good from algorithm-mapping point of view...|$|E
40|$|Recently, the {{dependence}} of grazing practices on forge supplementation, water hauling, hired labor and other livestock production factors have been substantially increased. Since, livestock grazing practices in Saudi Arabia has changed from the traditional pastoral system to a more sophisticated, business oriented practice, it was essential to study livestock production cost function on rangelands to determine the optimum herd size. The study is based on survey research of livestock production on rangelands (sheep, goats and camels) in Rumah area. 	The cubic functional form for the total cost function is applied on two classes of grazers (only sheep and goats, and sheep, goats and camels) to determine the optimum economical <b>hard</b> <b>size</b> of livestock production. The relation between livestock production and the herd size is also considered. Results indicated that herds constituted of sheep, goats and camels are smaller than those of only sheep and goats for the same livestock production level. The optimum economical herd size of the first class (only sheep and goats) was 480. However, it was undetermined for the second class due to {{the dominance of the}} linear relationship on the total cost function. Increasing the livestock production by one animal unit was associated with an increase in herd size by 1. 07 animal unit for the second class, where it was 2. 55 animal for herds constituted of only sheep and goat...|$|E
