25|$|The R32 Skyline {{debuted in}} May 1989. It was {{available}} {{as either a}} 2-door coupe or 4-door hardtop sedan, all other bodystyles were dropped. The R32 featured several versions of the RB-series straight-6 engines, which had improved heads (the twelve port inlet was gone) and used the ECCS (Electronically Concentrated Control System) injection system. Also available was an 1,800 cc 4-cylinder GXi model. Most models had HICAS four-wheel steering, with the rear wheels being hydraulically linked to the <b>front</b> <b>steering.</b> The 2.5-litre GTS-25 {{became one of the}} first Japanese production cars to feature a 5-speed automatic transmission. The GTS-t came in standard and Type M configurations, with the Type M having larger five-stud 16-inch wheels, four piston front callipers and twin piston rears plus other minor differences. ABS was optional (except for the GT-R and GTS-4), mechanical LSD was standard on the GTR and viscous LSD was standard on all turbo models and optional on all but the GXi. Nissan also produced 100 Australian models of the R32. In addition, there was a 4WD version of the GTS-t Type M, called the GTS-4.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} an active safety {{system for a}} wheeled armored vehicle to encounter {{the effect of the}} firing force. The firing force which acts as an external disturbance causes unwanted yaw moment occurred at the center of gravity of the wheeled armored vehicle. This effect causes the wheeled armored vehicle lose its handling stability and the traveling path after the firing condition. In order to overcome the stability problem, a Firing-On-the-Move assisted by an Active <b>Front</b> Wheel <b>Steering</b> system is proposed in this study. This system is developed based on two established systems, namely, Firing-On-the-Move and Active <b>Front</b> Wheel <b>Steering</b> systems. The proposed system is designed to improve the handling and directional stability performances of the armored vehicle while fires in dynamic condition. Four types of control strategies are designed and investigated in this study to identify the most optimum control strategy as the Firing-On-the-Move assisted by an Active <b>Front</b> Wheel <b>Steering</b> system using optimization tool, genetic algorithm. The control strategies for the Firing-On-the-Move assisted by an Active <b>Front</b> Wheel <b>Steering</b> are evaluated using various types of vehicle speeds and firing angle in order to obtain an appropriate control structure as the Firing-On-the-Move assisted by an Active <b>Front</b> Wheel <b>Steering</b> system for the wheeled armored vehicle...|$|R

2500|$|The {{air-cooled}} Villiers 10D [...] engine had a {{unit construction}} three-speed manual gearbox without reverse. This had an output of [...] at 4,400rpm which the manufacturers claimed gave a power-to-weight ratio of [...] per ton unladen. The engine unit sat in an alloy cradle {{ahead of the}} front wheel, together forming part of its support. Both front wheel and engine were sprung {{as part of the}} trailing link front suspension system, which was fitted with a single coil spring and an Andre Hartford friction damper. The rear wheels were rigidly mounted to the body on stub axles with suspension provided by low pressure [...] "balloon" [...] type tyres. Starting was achieved by using a pull handle mounted under the dash panel and connected by cable to a modified kick-start lever on the engine. The steering comprised a system of pulleys and a cable usually referred to as [...] "bobbin and cable", connecting a conventional steering wheel to the <b>front</b> <b>steering</b> unit. The bobbin and cable steering arrangement was replaced by a rack and pinion system in October 1950. Brakes were provided on only the rear wheels; they were conventional drum brakes operated by a system of cables and rods.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Issues of {{stability}} and bifurcation phenomena in ve-hicle lateral dynamics are presented. Based on the assumption of constant driving speed, a second-order nonlinear lateral dynamics model is obtained. Local stability and existence conditions for saddle-node bifurcation appearing in vehicle dynamics with re-spect to the variations in <b>front</b> wheel <b>steering</b> angle are then derived via system linearization and local bifurcation analysis. Bifurcation phenomena occurring in vehicle lateral dynamics might result in spin and/or system instability. A perturbation method is employed to solve for an approximation of system equi-librium near the zero value of the <b>front</b> wheel <b>steering</b> angle, which reveals the relationship between sideslip angle and the applied front wheel angle. Numerical simulations from an example model demonstrate the theoretical results. Index Terms—Bifurcation analysis, perturbation method, vehicle’s lateral dynamics. I...|$|R

40|$|Steering and braking {{control is}} applied to avoid {{rollover}} of road vehicles. The control concept presented is composed of three feedback loops: Continuous operation steering control, emergency steering control and emergency braking control. In continuous operation the roll rate and the roll acceleration are fed back by velocity scheduled gains to the <b>front</b> wheel <b>steering</b> angle. Thereby, the vehicle's roll damping is robustly improved {{for a wide range}} of speed and height of the center of gravity. The latter may change for example with a truck from ride to ride. A rollover coe #cient is defined that basically depends on the lateral acceleration at the center of gravity of the vehicle's sprung mass. For critical values of this variable the emergency steering and braking system is activated. The rollover coe #cient is also used for nonlinear feedback to the <b>front</b> wheel <b>steering</b> angle. The control concept is evaluated by linear sensitivity analysis and by simulations.
