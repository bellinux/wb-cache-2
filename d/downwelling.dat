5|$|The {{circulation}} {{patterns in}} the upper mesosphere and thermosphere of Venus are completely different {{from those in the}} lower atmosphere. At altitudes 90–150km the Venusian air moves from the dayside to nightside of the planet, with upwelling over sunlit hemisphere and <b>downwelling</b> over dark hemisphere. The <b>downwelling</b> over the nightside causes adiabatic heating of the air, which forms a warm layer in the nightside mesosphere at the altitudes 90–120km. The temperature of this layer—230K (−43°C) is far higher than the typical temperature found in the nightside thermosphere—100K (−173°C). The air circulated from the dayside also carries oxygen atoms, which after recombination form excited molecules of oxygen in the long-lived singlet state (1Δg), which then relax and emit infrared radiation at the wavelength 1.27μm. This radiation from the altitude range 90–100km is often observed from the ground and spacecraft. The nightside upper mesosphere and thermosphere of Venus is also the source of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium emissions of CO2 and nitric oxide molecules, which are responsible for the low temperature of the nightside thermosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{intrinsic}} green luminescence of the cookiecutter shark is {{the strongest}} known of any shark, and {{has been reported to}} persist for three hours after it has been taken out of water. The ventrally positioned photophores serve to disrupt its silhouette from below by matching the <b>downwelling</b> light, a strategy known as counter-illumination, that is common among bioluminescent organisms of the mesopelagic zone. The individual photophores are set around the denticles and are small enough that they cannot be discerned by the naked eye, suggesting they have evolved to fool animals with high visual acuity and/or at close distances.|$|E
25|$|The {{uncertainty}} in COROT-7b mass {{does not allow}} precise modelling of the planet structure. Nevertheless, educated guesses could still be put forth. Assuming a 5-Earth-masses planet, the planet was modeled to have convection in the mantle with a small core {{with no more than}} 15% the mass of the planet, or 0.7 M⊕. The lower mantle above the core-mantle boundary has more sluggish convection than the upper mantle because the greater pressure causes fluids to become more viscous. The temperature of the upper convecting mantle is different {{from one side of the}} planet to the other with lateral temperature differences for downwellings up to several hundred kelvins. However, the temperature of the upwelling is unaffected by <b>downwelling</b> and surface temperature variations. On the permanent dayside of the tidally locked planet where the surface temperature is hot from continuously facing its sun, the surface takes part in convection, which is the evidence that all the surface of this hemisphere being covered in oceans of lava. On the permanent nightside, the surface is cool enough for the formation of the crust with pools of lava above the convective mantle with intense volcanism. The dayside of the planet has larger convection cells than the nightside. Researchers also investigated the physical state of the interior of CoRoT-7b, indicating as likely a solid iron core, thus a self-generated magnetic field should be absent on the planet.|$|E
40|$|Small scale {{convection}} can {{be defined}} as that part of the mantle circulation in which upwellings and <b>downwellings</b> can occur beneath the lithosphere within the interiors of plates, in contrast to the large scale flow associated with plate motions where upwellings and <b>downwellings</b> occur at ridges and trenches. The two scales of convection will interact so that the form of the small scale convection will depend on how it arises within the large scale flow. Observations based on GEOS- 3 and SEASAT altimetry suggest that small scale convection occurs in at least two different ways...|$|R

3000|$|Another {{mechanism}} to cause deeper brittle yielding {{might be the}} slight time-dependent bending of the plates while floating on a weaker, convecting mantle. The time-dependent mantle up- and <b>downwellings</b> induce a time-dependent vertical forcing on the plate floating above, which causes topography at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). In the model where the top surface is vertically fixed, this deflection {{at the base of}} the plate is accommodated by plate-internal deformation. Releasing the plate surface from its vertical fixity, however, causes the plate to deflect in its entirety: positive and negative surface deflections matching the LAB topography occur above mantle up- and <b>downwellings,</b> respectively (Fig. 5 [...]...|$|R
500|$|The name [...] "cookiecutter shark" [...] {{refers to}} its feeding habit of gouging round plugs, as if cut {{out with a}} cookie cutter, out of larger animals. Marks made by cookiecutter sharks have been found {{on a wide variety}} of marine mammals and fishes, as well as on submarines, undersea cables, and even human bodies. It also consumes whole smaller prey such as squid. Cookiecutter sharks have adaptations for {{hovering}} in the water column and likely rely on stealth and subterfuge to capture more active prey. Its dark collar seems to mimic the silhouette of a small fish, while the rest of its body blends into the <b>downwelling</b> light via its ventral photophores. When a would-be predator approaches the lure, the shark attaches itself using its suctorial lips and specialized pharynx and neatly excises a chunk of flesh using its bandsaw-like set of lower teeth. This species has been known to travel in schools.|$|E
500|$|Odd {{structures}} {{known as}} polar vortices lie within the cold polar collars. They are giant hurricane-like storms four {{times larger than}} their terrestrial analogs. Each vortex has two [...] "eyes"—the centres of rotation, which are connected by distinct S-shaped cloud structures. Such double eyed structures are also called polar dipoles. Vortices rotate with the period of about 3 days {{in the direction of}} general super-rotation of the atmosphere. The linear wind speeds are 35–50m/s near their outer edges and zero at the poles. The temperature at the cloud-tops in the each polar vortex is much higher than in the nearby polar collars reaching 250K (−23°C). The conventional interpretation of the polar vortices is that they are anticyclones with <b>downwelling</b> in the centre and upwelling in the cold polar collars. This type of circulation resembles a winter polar anticyclonic vortex on Earth, especially the one found over Antarctica. The observations in the various infrared atmospheric windows indicate that the anticyclonic circulation observed near the poles penetrates as deep as to 50km altitude, i.e. {{to the base of the}} clouds. The polar upper troposphere and mesosphere are extremely dynamic; large bright clouds may appear and disappear over the space of a few hours. One such event was observed by Venus Express between 9 and 13 January 2007, when the south polar region became brighter by 30%. This event was probably caused by an injection of sulfur dioxide into the mesosphere, which then condensed forming a bright haze. The two eyes in the vortices have yet to be explained.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} types of kreisel tanks. In a true kreisel, a {{circular}} tank has a circular, submerged lid. Pseudokreisels are [...] "U" [...] or semicircle shaped, usually without a lid. Stretch kreisels are a [...] "double gyre" [...] kreisel design, where the tank length is at least twice the height. Using two <b>downwelling</b> inlets {{on both sides of}} the tank lets gravity create two gyres in the tank. A single <b>downwelling</b> inlet may be used in the middle as well. The top of a stretch kreisel may be open or closed with a lid. There may also be screens about midway down the sides of the tank, or at the top on the sides. It is possible to combine these designs; a circular shaped tank is used without a lid or cover, and the surface of the water acts as the continuation of circular flow. [...] It is now possible to start a jellyfish aquarium at home as easily as a regular fish tank.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{develops}} a geophysical model for Venus that allows separation of topography supported by shallow density anomalies, e. g., crustal thickening, from that interpreted {{to be caused}} by mantle convection, and produces estimates of the planforms of lithospheric density anomalies and the mantle convection pattern. The topography caused by these two planforms is compared to several global data sets compiled from analysis of Magellan data. The mantle convection pattern agrees qualitatively with numerical simulations by Bercovici et al. (1989) and shows isolated upwellings amidst a network of <b>downwellings.</b> Crustal thickening does not exhibit a similar pattern. Impact crater density is nearly uniform and does not correlate with either crustal thickening or the mantle convection patterns. Large volcanic structures exhibit a good but imperfect correlation with mantle upwellings.

2500|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, Felix Andries Vening Meinesz {{developed}} a unique gravimeter that could measure gravity aboard a submarine {{and used it}} to measure gravity over trenches. His measurements revealed that trenches are sites of <b>downwelling</b> in the solid Earth. The concept of <b>downwelling</b> at trenches was characterized by Griggs in 1939 as the tectogene hypothesis, for which he {{developed a}}n analogue model using a pair of rotating drums. World War II in the Pacific led to great improvements of bathymetry, particularly in the western Pacific, and the linear nature of these deeps became clear. The rapid growth of deep sea research efforts, especially the widespread use of echosounders in the 1950s and 1960s confirmed the morphological utility of the term. Important trenches were identified, sampled, and their greatest depths sonically plumbed. [...] The early phase of trench exploration culminated in the 1960 descent of the Bathyscaphe Trieste, which set an unbeatable world record by diving {{to the bottom of the}} Challenger Deep. Following Robert S. Dietz’ and Harry Hess’ articulation of the seafloor spreading hypothesis in the early 1960s and the plate tectonic revolution in the late 1960s the term “trench“ has been redefined with plate tectonic as well as bathymetric connotations.|$|E
40|$|Below {{subduction}} zones, {{high resolution}} seismic tomographic models resolve fast anomalies that often extend {{into the deep}} lower mantle. These anomalies are generally interpreted as slabs penetrating through the 660 -km seismic discontinuity, {{evidence in support of}} whole-mantle convection. However, thermal coupling between two ow systems separated by an impermeable interface might provide an al ternative explanation of the tomographic results. We have tested this hypothesis within the context of an axisymmet ric model of mantle convection in which an impermeable boundary is imposed at a depth of 660 km. When an increase in viscosity alone is imposed across the impermeable interface, our results demonstrate the dominant role of mechanical coupling between shells, producing lower mantle upwellings (<b>downwellings)</b> below upper mantle <b>downwellings</b> (upwellings). However, we find that the effect of mechanical coupling can be significantly weakened if a narrow low viscosity zone exists beneath the 660 -km discontinuity. In such a case, both thermally induced `slabs' in the lower mantle and thermally activated plumes that rise from the upper/lower mantle boundary are observed even though mass transfer between the shells does not exist...|$|R
40|$|The first {{time-dependent}} numerical {{simulations of}} continental aggregation and dispersal demonstrate a dynamic feedback between {{the motion of}} continental plates and mantle convection.

The tilting of {{the plate}} {{segments}} together with the resulting gravitational sliding cause regionally high lithospheric stresses (in between tilted segments) that lead to increased and deeper yielding in the case with a free surface. In the models with a fixed surface, mantle up- and <b>downwellings</b> cause lateral pressure gradients inside the plate that lead to horizontal flow similar to the gravitational sliding mentioned above. However, the plate segments are, due to the fixed top, not tilted and this does therefore not cause any additional stress.|$|R
2500|$|The Somali {{current is}} {{characterized}} by seasonal changes influenced by the Southwest monsoon and the Northeast Monsoon. [...] During the months of June to September, the warm Southwest monsoon moves the coastal waters northeastward, creating coastal upwelling. [...] The upwelled water is carried offshore by Ekman transport and merges with water that {{was brought to the}} surface by open-ocean upwelling. [...] The Findlater jet, a narrow low-level, atmospheric jet, also develops during the Southwest monsoon, and blows diagonally across the Indian Ocean, parallel to the coasts of Somalia and Oman. [...] As a result, an Ekman transport is created {{to the right of the}} wind. [...] At the center of the jet, the transport is maximum and decreases to the right and left with increasing distance. [...] To the left of the jet center, there is less water movement toward the center than is leaving, creating a divergence in the upper layer and resulting in an upwelling event (Ekman suction). [...] In contrast, to the right of the center of the jet, more water is coming from the center than is leaving, creating a <b>downwelling</b> event (Ekman pumping). [...] This open-ocean upwelling in combination with the coastal upwelling cause a massive upwelling. [...] The Northeast monsoon, which occurs from December to February, causes a reversal of the Somalia current, moving the coastal waters southwest. [...] Cooler air causes the surface water to cool and creates deep mixing, bringing abundant nutrients to the surface.|$|E

The difficulties with this mechanism include the effects of internal heating, background mantle convection, upper mantle phase changes, pressure dependent thermodynamic properties (low a, high lattice conductivity in D"), cold <b>downwellings</b> and lack of a mechanism for fixing locations. In the mantle, upwellings are expected to be broad and to be seriously affected by both endothermic and exothermic phase changes, plate motions and by dense cold <b>downwellings.,</b> The ability of the mantle to generate narrow, hot, low viscosity, fixed plumes, independent of plate motions and convection, has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, the chemistry of so-called hotspot or plume magmas does not favor a deep source, particularly one at the core-mantle boundary (D"). The strongest evidence against a plume origin in a thin layer in contact with the core is the high and chondritic siderophile chemistry of "plume" basalts. Other components of hotspot magmas are fairly convincingly due to recycled material (oceanic and continental sediments, dehydrated slab, slab fluids) of various ages. All of the chemical components of hotspot magmas are found in island arc magmas and xenoliths, suggesting that the enriched components of hotspots can be provided by the shallow mantle.
