5000|$|An older, and {{presently}} less commonly used, {{style of}} top vent {{is called a}} [...] "Velcro-style" [...] vent. This too is a disk of fabric {{at the top of}} the balloon. However, rather than having a set of [...] "vent lines" [...] that can repeatedly open and close the vent, the vent is secured by [...] "hook and loop" [...] fasteners (such as Velcro) and is only opened at the end of the flight. Balloons equipped with a Velcro-style vent typically have a second [...] "maneuvering vent" [...] built into the side (as opposed to the top) of the balloon. Another common type of top design is the [...] "Smart Vent," [...] which, rather than lowering a <b>fabric</b> <b>disc</b> into the envelope as in the [...] "parachute" [...] type, gathers the fabric together in the center of the opening. This system can theoretically be used for in-flight maneuvering, but is more commonly used only as a rapid-deflation device for use after landing, of particular value in high winds. Other designs, such as the [...] "pop top" [...] and [...] "MultiVent" [...] systems, have also attempted to address the need for rapid deflation on landing, but the parachute top remains popular as an all-around maneuvering and deflation system.|$|E
40|$|OBJECT: This 2 -year {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the efficacy of a bioactive three-dimensional (3 D) <b>fabric</b> <b>disc</b> for lumbar intervertebral disc replacement. The authors used a bioresorbable spinal fixation rod consisting of a forged composite of particulate unsintered hydroxyapatite/poly-L-lactide acid (HA/PLLA) for stability augmentation. The biomechanical and histological alterations as well as possible device-related loosening were examined at 2 years postoperatively. METHODS: Two lumbar intervertebral discs (L 2 - 3 and L 4 - 5) were replaced with the 3 D fabric discs, which were augmented by two titanium screws and a spanning bioresorbable rod (HA/PLLA). The segmental biomechanics and interface bone ingrowth were investigated at 6, 15, and 24 months postoperatively, and results were compared with the other two surgical groups (3 D <b>fabric</b> <b>disc</b> alone; 3 D <b>fabric</b> <b>disc</b> with additional anterior instrumentation stabilization). The 3 D <b>fabric</b> <b>disc</b> and HA/PLLA-spinal segments demonstrated segmental mobility at 15 and 24 months; however, the range of motion (ROM) in flexion-extension decreased to 49 and 40 %, respectively, despite statistically equivalent preserved torsional ROM. Histologically there was excellent osseous fusion at the 3 D <b>fabric</b> <b>disc</b> surface-vertebral body interface. At 2 years posttreatment, no adverse tissue reaction nor aseptic loosening of the device was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Intervertebral disc replacement with the 3 D <b>fabric</b> <b>disc</b> was viable and when used in conjunction with the bioresorbable HA/PLLA spinal augmentation. Further refinements of device design to create a stand-alone type are necessary to obviate the need for additional spinal stabilization...|$|E
40|$|Running Head: Multidirectional {{flexibility}} of cervical disc replacement Object. The in vitro experimental {{study was conducted}} to investigate the initial biomechanical effect of artificial intervertebral disc replacement in the cervical spine. The multidirectional {{flexibility of}} replaced and adjacent spinal segment was analyzed using a cadaveric cervical spine model. Methods. Using seven human cadaveric occipitocervical spines, the following three cervical reconstructions were sequentially performed at C 5 - 6 level after anterior diskectomy: Anterior artificial disc replacement with bioactive three-dimensional <b>fabric</b> <b>disc</b> (3 -DF disc: 3 DF); Anterior iliac bone graft (AG); and Anterior plate fixation with iliac bone graft (AP). Six unconstrained pure moments were applied with a six-degree-of-freedom spine simulator (6 DOF-SS) and three-dimensional segmental motions at the operative and adjacent segments were measured with an optoelectronic motion measurement system. The 3 DF group demonstrated statistically equivalent range of motions (ROMs) when compared to intact values in axial rotation and lateral bending. The 45 % increase of flexion-extension RO...|$|E
40|$|Besides {{their high}} weight, {{conventional}} cast brake discs have an insufficiant tribological lifetime determining disadvantage. C/C-discs are no alterantive. The {{goal of the}} R+D program was to develop and manufacture and to test brake discs made of ceramic matrix composites (CMC) in high-speed railway brake-systems. The material development has focused on creating a homogeneous morphology and reproducable material properties in bigger, thick-walled parts. The development of manufacturing processing comprised the economic preform-technique, the pyrolysis and silicon infiltration treatments with suitable efficient process sequences and finally, the upscaling for big discs with original dimensions. Test of brake <b>discs</b> made of <b>fabric</b> based C/C-SiC proved the tribological properties originally claimed. Due to the significantly changing {{of the values of}} wear resistance and heat conductivity, further improvement of <b>fabric</b> based <b>discs</b> with original dimensions is necessary. (orig.)

40|$|A simple {{visual and}} tristimulus {{colorimetric}} method (three-dimensional system CIE-L*a*b*) for {{the determination of}} trace amounts of hydrogen cyanide in air has been developed. The method {{is based on the}} suction of hydrogen cyanide through a chlorinating cartridge where cyanogen chloride is formed, which is further driven to an indicator disc made of a modified cotton <b>fabric.</b> This indicator <b>disc</b> is placed into an adapter. Prior to analysis, the disc is saturated with a chromogenic reagent, a solution of 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -cyclohexanedione (dimedone) and 4 -benzylpyridine in ethanol. In the presence of hydrogen cyanide (cyanogen chloride), a pink coloration emerges on the indicator disc, the intensity of which is evaluated either visually or by use of a tristimulus colorimeter. The detection limit is 0. 1 mg m- 3. The method is mainly suitable for mobile field analyses. It was applied for the CHP- 5 chemical agent detector introduced into the equipment of the Czech Army corps...|$|R

The multidirectional flexibility of replaced and adjacent spinal segments were analyzed using a cadaveric cervical spine model. METHODS: The following three cervical reconstructions were sequentially performed at the C 5 - 6 level after anterior discectomy in seven human cadaveric occipitocervical spines: anterior artificial disc replacement with a bioactive three-dimensional (3 D) <b>fabric</b> <b>disc</b> (FD); anterior iliac bone graft; and anterior plate fixation with iliac bone graft. Six unconstrained pure moments were applied with a 6 -df spine simulator, and 3 D segmental motions at the operative and adjacent segments were measured with an optoelectronic motion measurement system. The 3 D FD group demonstrated statistically equivalent ranges of motion (ROMs) when compared with intact values in axial rotation and lateral bending. The 45 % increase in flexion-extension ROM was demonstrated in 3 D FD group; however, neutral zone analysis did not reach statistical significance between the intact spine and 3 D FD. The anterior iliac bone graft and iliac bone graft reconstructions demonstrated statistically lower ROMs when compared with 3 D FD in all loading modes (p < 0. 05). The adjacent-level ROMs of the 3 D FD group demonstrated nearly physiological characteristics at upper and lower adjacent levels. Excellent stability at the interface was maintained during the whole testing without any device displacement and dislodgment. CONCLUSIONS: The stand-alone cervical 3 D FD demonstrated nearly physiological biomechanical characteristics at both operative and adjacent spinal segments in vitro, indicating an excellent clinical potential for cervical artificial disc replacement...|$|E
40|$|The Sonochemistry Centre at Coventry University {{is one of}} a {{group of}} organisations working on a project to develop a new {{technology}} for producing antimicrobial textiles. This technology involves the use of an ultrasonic process (sonochemical) to generate and impregnate fabrics with antibacterial metal oxide nanoparticles. The expectation is that these textiles can be produced at an affordable price for routine use in hospitals as uniforms, curtains, hospital bed sheets and linen. The aim of this PhD project was to assess the antibacterial activity of fabrics impregnated with ZnO and CuO NPs against a variety of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. The testing was principally carried out according to the absorption method from ISO 20743 : 2007. Research was also extended to compare different methods of assessing antibacterial activity of textile <b>fabrics.</b> These included <b>disc</b> diffusion tests and shake flask tests in saline or nutrient broth. Overall the results from absorption tests demonstrated that both the ZnO and CuO impregnated fabrics showed very good levels of antibacterial activity (A> 2) against the test bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). During the optimisation of lab scale process to the pilot scale, two different types of CuO fabrics were produced to test and compare the antibacterial activity. One type of fabrics were impregnated with pre-made CuO nanoparticles by a ‘throwing the stones’ technology termed TTS and the other with sonochemically formed nanoparticles (in-situ), same as the lab process. The results indicated that the fabrics impregnated with sonochemically formed NPs displayed better antibacterial activity than the pre-made NPs. Leaching of the antibacterial agents in to saline was investigated using a shake flask method. CuO and ZnO coated fabrics prepared at laboratory scale were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii and Escherichia coli. It was found that leachates prepared by shaking the fabrics in saline for 3 hours showed no antibacterial activity for CuO fabrics. However, leachates from ZnO fabrics showed an excellent activity after 24 ± 3 hours against all three bacterial species. Flow cytometry (FC) was investigated as an alternative to standard agar plate count (PC) methods for the determination of viable cell numbers. There was a general agreement between the results from agar plate counts and flow cytometry except that post incubation counts were greater with FC. The higher numbers of viable cells detected with FC may have been due to the presence of viable but not culturable cells (VBNC). Viable cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy in post incubation samples in which no viable cells were detected on nutrient agar plates. Cytotoxicity studies were conducted on ZnO and CuO fabrics from the pilot scale (both in-situ and TTS) against human dermal fibroblast cells (HDF) and human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG 2) using a MTT assay to determine cell viability. The results showed that ZnO and CuO are not toxic to HDF cells. However, cytotoxicity was seen in HepG 2 cells with cell viability decreasing by > 14 % for all the fabrics after 24 hours...|$|R
