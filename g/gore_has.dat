5|$|A {{conservative}} Washington D.C. think tank, and a Republican {{member of}} Congress, among others, {{have claimed that}} <b>Gore</b> <b>has</b> a conflict-of-interest for advocating for taxpayer subsidies of green-energy technologies {{in which he has}} a personal investment. Additionally, he has been criticized for his above-average energy consumption in using private jets, and in owning multiple, very large homes, one of which was reported in 2007 as using high amounts of electricity. Gore's spokesperson responded by stating that the Gores use renewable energy which is more expensive than regular energy and that the Tennessee house in question has been retrofitted to make it more energy-efficient.|$|E
5|$|While <b>Gore</b> <b>has</b> criticized Bush for his Katrina response, he has {{not spoken}} {{publicly}} about his part in the evacuation of 270 patients on September 3 & 4, 2005, from Charity Hospital in New Orleans to Tennessee. On September 1, Gore was contacted by Charity Hospital's Neurosurgeon Dr. David Kline, who had operated on his son Albert, through Greg Simon of FasterCures. Kline informed Gore and Simon of the desperate conditions {{at the hospital and}} asked Gore and Simon to arrange relief. On Gore's personal financial commitment, two airlines each provided a plane with one flight latter underwritten by Larry Flax. The flights were flown by volunteer airline crews and medically staffed by Gore's cousin, retired Col. Dar LaFon, and family physician Dr. Anderson Spickard and were accompanied by Gore and Albert III. Gore used his political influence to expedite landing rights in New Orleans.|$|E

He would serve for the next eight years. <b>Gore</b> <b>has</b> not, as of 2017, considered another presidential run, remaining neutral in the Democratic primaries of 2004, 2008, and 2016.|$|E
25|$|Death was an American death metal {{band from}} Orlando, Florida, founded in 1983 by guitarist and vocalist Chuck Schuldiner. Death is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most influential bands in heavy metal and a pioneering force in death metal. Its debut album, Scream Bloody <b>Gore,</b> <b>has</b> been widely regarded as the first death metal record, while the band's driving force, Chuck Schuldiner, is acknowledged as the originator of extreme metal. Death had a revolving lineup, with Schuldiner being the sole consistent member. The group's style also progressed, from the raw sound on its early albums to a more sophisticated one in its later stage. The band ceased to exist after Schuldiner died of glioma and pneumonia in December 2001, but remains an enduring metal band.|$|E

50|$|On March 10, 2015, Gore {{signed a}} three-year, $12 million {{contract}} with the Indianapolis Colts. His contract includes $8.5 million in guarantees. Prior to signing with the Colts, it was widely reported that <b>Gore</b> <b>had</b> agreed to {{a deal with the}} Philadelphia Eagles on March 9 to replace LeSean McCoy. However, the following day several sources claimed that <b>Gore</b> <b>had</b> second thoughts about his agreement, and instead signed with Indianapolis.|$|R
25|$|The early call of Florida for <b>Gore</b> <b>has</b> been {{alleged to}} have cost Bush several close states, {{including}} Iowa, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wisconsin. In each of these states, Gore won by less than 10,000 votes, and the polls closed after the networks called Florida for Gore. Because the Florida call was widely seen as an indicator that Gore had won the election, {{it is possible that}} it depressed Republican turnout in these states during the final hours of voting, giving Gore the slim margin by which he carried each of them. Had Bush carried all four of these states, he {{would have been able to}} win the electoral vote, even with a loss in Florida. Likewise, the call may have affected the outcome of the Senate election in Washington state, where incumbent Republican Slade Gorton was defeated by approximately 2,000 votes statewide.|$|E
500|$|Gore was [...] "dispirited" [...] {{after his}} return from Vietnam. NashvillePost.com noted that, [...] "his father's defeat made service in a {{conflict}} he deeply opposed even more abhorrent to Gore. His experiences in the war zone don't {{seem to have been}} deeply traumatic in themselves; although the engineers were sometimes fired upon, <b>Gore</b> <b>has</b> said he didn't see full-scale combat.

500|$|<b>Gore</b> <b>has</b> been {{involved}} with environmental issues since 1976, when as a freshman congressman, he held the [...] "first congressional hearings on the climate change, and co-sponsor hearings on toxic waste and global warming." [...] He continued to speak on the topic throughout the 1980s, and is still prevalent in the environmental community. He was {{known as one of}} the Atari Democrats, later called the [...] "Democrats' Greens, politicians who see issues like clean air, clean water and global warming as the key to future victories for their party." ...|$|E

In his never-ending {{research}} for Plasma Power, Gore, {{who is a}} genius magician had joined Bilstein's Fourth Empire as Bilstein had a large library of forbidden Plasma info. However, <b>Gore</b> <b>had</b> planned to secretly betray Bilstein and take everything for himself. Gore's plans however go awry when Bilstein commands him to retire the artificial girl he made, Luca {{due to the fact}} that Bilstein had feared about the possible security threat that Luca had posed to him and the Fourth Empire. <b>Gore</b> <b>had</b> rebelled against Bilstein's command and went into immediate hiding with Luca. To avoid easy detection, <b>Gore</b> <b>had</b> changed his appearance with Plasma Magic and went into leisurely seclusion, possibly marrying Luca as well.|$|R

500|$|Clinton's {{choice was}} criticized as {{unconventional}} because rather than picking {{a running mate}} who would diversify the ticket, Clinton chose a fellow Southerner who shared his political ideologies and who was nearly {{the same age as}} Clinton. The Washington Bureau Chief for The Baltimore Sun, Paul West, later suggested that, [...] "Al Gore revolutionized the way Vice Presidents are made. When he joined Bill Clinton's ticket, it violated the old rules. Regional diversity? Not with two Southerners from neighboring states. Ideological balance? A couple of left-of-center moderates. [...] And yet, <b>Gore</b> <b>has</b> come to be regarded by strategists in both parties as the best vice presidential pick in at least 20 years." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Gore</b> <b>has</b> {{said that}} his other reason for enlisting {{was that he did}} not want someone with fewer options than he to go in his place. Actor Tommy Lee Jones, a former college housemate, {{recalled}} Gore saying that [...] "if he found a fancy way of not going, someone else would have to go in his place". His Harvard advisor, Richard Neustadt, also stated that Gore decided, [...] "that he would have to go as an enlisted man because, he said, 'In Tennessee, that's what most people have to do.

500|$|Back in {{the present}} day, Peter discovers that his past actions have had drastic effects on the world: he and Molly {{have been married for}} 20 years; Judd Nelson crashes at their house once or twice a week; Lois is married to Quagmire; Al Gore is now the President of the United States; Chris, Meg, and Stewie have Quagmire's chin, nose, and mannerisms; and Chevy Chase is the host of The Tonight Show. Brian {{explains}} to Peter that by missing out on his date with Lois and making out with Molly, he altered the time line. Despite Brian's objections about leaving the [...] "perfect" [...] world (in which there are flying cars that run on vegetable oil and <b>Gore</b> <b>has</b> killed Osama bin Laden by strangling him with his bare hands), Peter wants {{to go back to the}} past so he can undo his mistake. Brian says that this is impossible because Death can only be summoned if someone dies and thanks to Gore's universal health care, people are living much longer along with a strong, well-funded educational system and zero tolerance gun control that has eliminated street crime. However, when Jane Jetson suddenly falls on the sidewalk and dies, Death arrives and again grants Peter's wish to return to the past. Back in the past, Peter is determined to accept Lois' invitation but repeatedly blows his opportunity and ends up repeatedly asking Death for a do-over. When Peter finally gets it right, he forgets a few hours later and parties with Cleveland instead of keeping the date. He asks Death for another chance but Death, fed up with Peter's continued blunders, tells him that he will have to fix the problem on his own.|$|E

500|$|Civil disobedience as non-violent protest {{or civil}} {{resistance}} are also acts of conscience, but are designed {{by those who}} undertake them chiefly to change, by appealing to the majority and democratic processes, laws or government policies perceived to be incoherent with fundamental social virtues and principles (such as justice, equality or respect for intrinsic human dignity). Civil disobedience, in a properly functioning democracy, allows a minority who feel strongly that a law infringes their sense of justice (but have no capacity to obtain legislative amendments or {{a referendum on the}} issue) to make a potentially apathetic or uninformed majority take account of the intensity of opposing views. A notable example of civil resistance or satyagraha ("satya" [...] in sanskrit means [...] "truth and compassion", [...] "agraha" [...] means [...] "firmness of will") involved Mahatma Gandhi making salt in India when that act was prohibited by a British statute, in order to create moral pressure for law reform. Rosa Parks similarly acted on conscience in 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama refusing a legal order to give up her seat to make room for a white passenger; her action (and the similar earlier act of 15-year-old Claudette Colvin) leading to the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Rachel Corrie was a US citizen allegedly killed by a bulldozer operated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) while involved in direct action (based on the non-violent principles of Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi) to prevent demolition of the home of local Palestinian pharmacist Samir Nasrallah. Al <b>Gore</b> <b>has</b> argued [...] "If you're a young person looking at the future of this planet and looking at what is being done right now, and not done, I believe we have reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration." [...] In 2011, NASA climate scientist James E. Hansen, environmental leader Phil Radford and Professor Bill McKibben were arrested for opposing a tar sands oil pipeline and Canadian renewable energy professor Mark Jaccard was arrested for opposing mountain-top coal mining; in his book Storms of my Grandchildren Hansen calls for similar civil resistance on a global scale to help replace the 'business-as-usual' Kyoto Protocol cap and trade system, with a progressive carbon tax at emission source on the oil, gas and coal industries – revenue being paid as dividends to low carbon footprint families.|$|E
