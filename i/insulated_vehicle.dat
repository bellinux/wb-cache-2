50|$|In {{all areas}} outside the central Lake Kyoga region, fish {{production}} increased throughout the 1980s. The Ugandan government supported several programs to augment fish production and processing. In 1987 a government-sponsored Integrated Fisheries Development Project established a boat construction and repair workshop at Jinja; a processing plant, several fish collecting centers, and fish marketing centers {{in several areas}} of Uganda. They also implemented the use of refrigerated <b>insulated</b> <b>vehicles</b> for transporting fish. China had managed the reconstruction of cold storage facilities in Kampala in the early 1980s. Soon after that, the government established the Sino-Uganda Fisheries Joint Venture Company to exploit fishing opportunities in Lake Victoria.|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} the Delta launch vehicle has {{incorporated}} the capability to be launched through rain. This capability was developed to eliminate a design constraint which {{could result in a}} costly launch delay. This paper presents the methodology developed to implement rain erosion protection for the <b>insulated</b> exterior <b>vehicle</b> surfaces. The effect of the interaction between insulation material rain erosion resistance, rainstorm models, surface geometry and trajectory variations is examined. It is concluded that rain erosion can significantly impact the performance of launch vehicle insulation systems and should be considered in their design...|$|R
5000|$|A further {{distinction}} may be {{made between}} sulkies with the axles rigidly connected to the vehicle, and those with the axles <b>insulated</b> from the <b>vehicle</b> by springs and dampers. Those with springs and dampers may be further divided into single-axle sprung carts and [...] "independent suspension" [...] sprung and damped carts. Needless to say, those with independent suspension by coil springs and dampers tend to be both more expensive and smoother riding.|$|R

The pole sits atop a sprung base {{on the roof of}} the vehicle, with springs providing the pressure to keep the trolley wheel or shoe in contact with the wire.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{solution was}} derived for the transient response of an <b>insulated</b> aerospace <b>vehicle</b> structure {{subjected to a}} simplified heat pulse. This simplified problem approximates the thermal response of a thermal protection system of an atmospheric entry vehicle. The exact analytical solution is solely a function of two non-dimensional parameters. A simpler function of these two parameters was developed to approximate the maximum structural temperature {{over a wide range}} of parameter values. Techniques were developed to choose constant, effective properties to represent the relevant temperature and pressure-dependent properties for the insulator and structure. A technique was also developed to map a time-varying surface temperature history to an equivalent square heat pulse. Using these techniques, the maximum structural temperature rise was calculated using the analytical solutions and shown to typically agree with finite element simulations within 10 to 20 percent over the relevant range of parameters studied...|$|R
40|$|A {{process is}} claimed for {{manufacturing}} {{a two or}} more layer composite comprising a carrier material (6) mainly or wholly made of a polymer transparent to microwaves bonded to a porous layer (7) based on a chemically-blown polymer foam which absorbs microwaves. The foamable polymer is heated by microwaves to activate the blowing agent and the polymer foam (7) created is simultaneously or subsequently heated by microwaves so that conducted heat melts {{the surface of the}} adjacent carrier material (6) and bonds the latter to the foam after cooling.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the power rating of electric <b>vehicles,</b> <b>insulated</b> gate bipolar translator (IGBT) modules with multiple power terminals are usually adopted. The transient current sharing of the same polarity power terminals {{is related to the}} stray inductance in the branches of the bus-bar. Based on the laminated bus-bar of a three-phase inverter in the electric vehicles that consists of asymmetrical parallel branches, this paper investigates the transient current imbalance sharing caused by the asymmetrical stray inductance in the parallel branches of the bus-bar from the view of energy storing and releasing of stray inductance for the first time. Besides, the partial self-inductance and mutual-inductance model of the parallel branches is set up. Finally, a high-precision partial stray inductance measurement method is proposed, and the accuracy of the partial stray inductance model for asymmetrical parallel branches is verified by experimental tests...|$|R
40|$|Porous {{monolithic}} ablative systems <b>insulate</b> atmospheric reentry <b>vehicles</b> from reentry plasmas {{generated by}} atmospheric braking from orbital and exo-orbital velocities. Due to the necessity that these materials create a temperature gradient {{up to several}} thousand Kelvin over their thickness, {{it is important that}} these materials are near their pristine state prior to reentry. These materials may also be on exposed surfaces to space environment threats like orbital debris and meteoroids leaving a probability that these exposed surfaces will be below their prescribed values. Owing to the typical small size of impact craters in these materials, the local flow fields over these craters and the ablative process afford some margin in thermal protection designs for these locally reduced performance values. In this work, tests to develop ballistic performance models for thermal protection materials typical of those being used on Orion are discussed. A density profile as a function of depth of a typical monolithic ablator and substructure system is shown in Figure 1 a...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical and experimental {{evaluation of the}} applicability of insulated pressure vessels for hydrogen-fueled light-duty <b>vehicles.</b> <b>Insulated</b> pressure vessels are cryogenic-capable pressure vessels that can be fueled with liquid hydrogen (LH 2) or ambient-temperature compressed hydrogen (CH 2). Insulated pressure vessels offer the advantages of liquid hydrogen tanks (low weight and volume), with reduced disadvantages (lower energy requirement for hydrogen liquefaction and reduced evaporative losses). The purpose of this work is to verify that commercially available aluminum-lined, fiber-wrapped vessels {{can be used for}} cryogenic hydrogen storage. The paper reports on previous and ongoing tests and analyses that have the purpose of improving the system design and assure its safety. The analytical and experimental results carried out until now indicate that {{it may be possible to}} use fiber-wrapped aluminum-lined vessels for operation at LH 2 temperature and high pressure. Required future tests are described that will assure vessel safety under daily operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|Small, {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs) {{are expanding}} {{the capabilities of}} aircraft systems. However, a gap exists in the size and capability of aircraft: no aircraft smaller than 10 kilograms are capable of flight faster than 100 meters per second. A small, fast aircraft requires a propulsion system which is both miniature and high-power, requirements which current UAV propulsion technologies do not meet. To meet this need, a slow-burning solid rocket motor has been developed. Such motors require slow-burning solid propellants with tailorable burn rate. This thesis reports experimental results and combustion theory for a slow-burning solid propellant. It also describes a rocket motor designed to use this propellant, and the manufacturing process used to produce it. This propellant burns slowly enough for the low-thrust, long-endurance needs of UAV propulsion. Its burn rate can be predictably tailored by addition of the burn rate suppressant oxamide. Further, this thesis presents a concept for a small, fast aircraft designed around this novel propulsion technology. The motor integrates elegantly into the aircraft's structure, and compact thermal protection system <b>insulates</b> other <b>vehicle</b> systems from the heat of combustion. These results demonstrate the feasibility slow-burning rocket propulsion systems, and their application to small aircraft. It should be possible for small, rocket-propelled UAVs to sustain powered, transonic flight for several minutes. With this technology, kilogram-scale UAVs could be able to quickly deploy over tens of kilometers, and fly joint missions alongside manned fighter jets. by Matthew T. Vernacchia. Thesis: S.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{application}} of insulated pressure vessels for hydrogen-fueled light-duty <b>vehicles.</b> <b>Insulated</b> pressure vessels can store liquid hydrogen (LH 2); low-temperature (90 K) compressed hydrogen (CH 2); or ambient temperature CH 2. In this analysis, hydrogen temperatures, pressures and venting losses am calculated for insulated pressure vessels fueled with LH 2 or with low-temperature CH 2, {{and the results are}} compared to those obtained in low-pressure LH 2 tanks. Hydrogen losses are calculated as a function of daily driving distance during normal operation; as a function of time during long periods of vehicle inactivity; and as a function of initial vessel temperature during fueling. The number of days before any venting losses occur is also calculated {{as a function of the}} daily driving distance. The results show that insulated pressure vessels have packaging characteristics comparable to those of conventional, low-pressure LH 2 tanks (low weight and volume), with greatly improved dormancy and much lower boil-off. Insulated pressure vessels used in a 17 km/l (40 mpg) car do not lose any hydrogen when the car is driven at least 15 km/day in average. Since almost all cars are driven for longer distances, most cars would never lose any hydrogen. Losses during long periods of parking are also relatively small. Due to their high-pressure capacity, these vessels would retain about a third of their full charge even after a very long dormancy, so that the owner would not risk running out of fuel. If an insulated pressure vessel reaches ambient temperature, it can be cooled down very effectively by fueling it with LH 2 with no losses during fueling. The vessel has good thermal performance even when thermally insulated with inexpensive microsphere insulation. In addition, the insulated pressure vessels greatly ease fuel availability and infrastructure requirements, since it would be compatible with both compressed and cryogenic hydrogen reveling...|$|R

At terminus points, the conductor must turn the trolley pole around to face the correct direction, pulling it off the wire either with a rope or a pole and walking it around to the other end. In some cases, two trolley poles are provided, one for each direction: in this case it is a matter of raising one and lowering the other. Since the operator could raise the pole at one end whilst the conductor lowered the other, this saved time and was much easier for the conductor. Care must be taken to raise the downed pole first, to eliminate the damage caused by arcing between the pole and wire. In the US, the dual-pole system was the most common arrangement on double-ended vehicles. However, pushing of the pole (called [...] "back-poling" [...] in the US or [...] "spear-poling" [...] in Australia), was quite common where the trams were moving at slow speeds, such as at wye terminals (also known as reversers) and whilst backing into the sheds.|$|R
