5000|$|Xenon difluoride (...) is a dry {{vapor phase}} {{isotropic}} etch for silicon originally applied for MEMS in 1995 at University of California, Los Angeles. Primarily used for releasing metal and dielectric structures by undercutting silicon, [...] {{has the advantage}} of a stiction-free release unlike wet etchants. Its etch selectivity to silicon is very high, allowing it to work with photoresist, , silicon nitride, and various metals for masking. Its reaction to silicon is [...] "plasmaless", is purely chemical and spontaneous and is often operated in pulsed mode. Models of the <b>etching</b> <b>action</b> are available, and university laboratories and various commercial tools offer solutions using this approach.|$|E

Mechanochemical polishing (MCP) uses mechanical energy to activate chemical reactions and structural changes. The processing of highly flat surfaces with few defects has been made possible by this method. Recently, the so-called chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) has been applied to the fine processing of electronic devices[15]. Further, a complex chemical grinding approach that combines chemical KOH solution <b>etching</b> and mechanical <b>action</b> has been studied[16]. These combined mechanochemical {{processing methods}} can achieve high-precision and low-damage machining, simply by using mechanical action to promote reactions with atmospheric gas and surface adsorption layers.|$|R
40|$|Wave-guided {{thin-film}} distributed-feedback (DFB) polymer lasers are fabricated by {{spin coating}} a PPV-derived semiconducting polymer, thianthrene-DOO-PPV, onto oxidised silicon wafers with corrugated second-order periodic gratings. The gratings are written by reactive ion beam <b>etching.</b> Laser <b>action</b> {{is achieved by}} transverse pumping with picosecond laser pulses (wavelength 347. 15 nm, duration 35 ps). The DFB-laser surface emission and edge emission are analysed. Outside the grating region the polymer film is used for comparative wave-guided travelling wave laser (amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)) studies. The pump pulse threshold energy density for wave-guided DFB-laser action (4 - 9 µJ cm- 2) {{is found to be}} approximately a factor of two lower than the threshold for wave-guided travelling wave laser action. The spectral width of the DFB laser (down to DFB≈ 0. 07 nm) is considerably narrower than that of the travelling wave laser (TWL≈ 14 nm). The DFB-laser emission is highly linearly polarised transverse to the grating axis (TE mode). Only at high pump pulse energy densities does an additional weak TM mode build up. The surface-emitted DFB-laser radiation has a low divergence along the grating direction. For both the DFB lasers and the travelling wave lasers, gain saturation occurs at high excitation energy densities...|$|R
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of the {{presented}} dissertation thesis was to study the sterilization efficiency of dielectric barrier discharge operated at atmospheric pressure. The fungi Aspergillus niger, gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis and in some experiments also gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli were used as a bio-indicator enabling to evaluate the effect of plasma assisted microbial inactivation. The samples of microorganism were placed on paper Whatman 1 or PET foil and exposed to plasma. The plasma was generated in argon, nitrogen, synthetic dry/humid air with frequency up to 10 kHz and plasma power density {{in the range of}} 1, 2 - 2, 9 W/cm 3 (according to the process gas). The influence of process gas, plasma power density, plasma exposition time, type of microorganism and material of the substrate on the sterilization effect of dielectric barrier discharge was evaluated. Furthermore the contribution of each single mechanism (UV radiation, temperature and reactive species) to the sterilization effect of plasma and influence of gas humidity was evaluated. The DBD was analysed by means of optical emission spectroscopy, thermocouple was used to measure temperature during a sterilization process. In order to verify the mechanical damage of the microbial cell or the substrates during the plasma process the samples were studied by scanning electron microscopy. Generally, on the basis of experimental results, at increasing treatment times, the remaining number of spores (CFU) decreased. Similarly at increasing the plasma power input, the sterilization rate increased. When sterilising the spores of A. niger in plasma using different process gasses, the efficiency of plasma sterilization decreased as follows: argon, humid synthetic air, nitrogen and dry synthetic air. The results observed in argon plasma using different microorganism demonstrated that the sensitivity of vegetative cells resp. spores to DBD decreased as follows: A. niger spores, B. subtilis vegetative cells, E. coli vegetative cells and B. subtilis spores. Simultaneously results observed for sterilization of spores and vegetative cells of B. subtilis and A. niger demonstrated that the spores are generally more resistant to plasma than are the corresponding vegetative cells. Combining the results of contribution of each single mechanism, optical emission spectroscopy and inactivation characteristic it was found out that the reactive species significantly contribute to the plasma sterilization in all process gasses. Furthermore the inactivation process can be partly assisted by UV radiation and also the temperature can contribute in limited extent to inactivation process in some gasses. The contribution of UV radiation to the plasma sterilization decreased as follows: nitrogen, argon, dry syntetic air and humid syntetic air. Moreover it was found out that the contribution of each single mechanism can be species dependent, {{this is due to the}} different response of microorganism to the unfavorable external conditions. SEM analysis of the substrates prooved the <b>etching</b> <b>actions</b> of the plasma generated in all process gasses on the surface of the PET foil. The several minute plasma exposition of the PET foil resulted in the occurence of the „hole corrosion“ on the PET surface. Contrary to these there were no visible changes observed in the paper structure...|$|R
40|$|This work explores anodic {{polarization}} process {{to generate a}} surface pattern composed of conical features on an aluminum surface in hot acid mixtures composed of sulfuric and phosphoric acids. It is shown that {{the composition of the}} electrolyte with respect to its phosphoric acid and water content and the surface roughness of the aluminum substrate are the critical parameters for the formation of the patterns. The best surface pattern was generated in a hot acidic mixture (60 ◦C) containing 150 mL sulfuric and 350 mL phosphoric acids on a ground aluminum surface. For the formation of conical structures, a mechanism based on the competitive <b>etching</b> <b>action</b> of sulfuric acid and the formation of phosphate precipitates is proposed. Additionally, the possibility of porous anodization of these surfaces in an oxalic acid based electrolyte has been also demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Continuous {{modification}} of polyester fabric {{was carried out}} by dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) of Ar-O 2 (10 : 1) at atmospheric pressure. The results revealed that the dyeability of polyester fabric was dramatically improved, and its reflectivity of light was considerably decreased. The spectral value (K/S) was found to be increased by about 50 ﹪. The dye up-take was found to be increased by about 18 ﹪. However, the dyeing fastness was the highest degree, that is to say, despite the large increase of the up-take, the dyeing fastness was not be affected by the modification treatment of the DBD. SEM studies showed that the smooth and glossy surface of polyester fibre became rough and deep in colour after treatment by the reason of <b>etching</b> <b>action</b> of the discharge.

40|$|Downyield for {{capacitors}} made {{on these}} wafers. The explanation {{that has been}} given for the roughening is micromasking: small gas bub-bles stick to the silicon surface and mask the silicon <b>etching</b> <b>action</b> of the APM. However, similar type of microroughness created by other etching techniques {{did not result in}} poor device yield. 6, 7 Roughening of silicon surfaces in APM is caused by selective etching. Silicon is etched by the fact that APM is an alkaline solu-tion. 8 In the absence of a strong oxidant such as hydrogen peroxide, silicon is preferentially etched along the [111] crystal planes. When the hydrogen peroxide concentration is not well controlled, this phe-nomenon can introduce roughening of silicon surfaces having [100] crystal orientation. Moreover, the surface that is most sensitive for this type of roughening is the HF-treated, hydrophobic silicon sur-face, i. e., a surface of bare silicon without a passivating oxide layer. The sequence, HF followed by APM, is common in IC manufactur...|$|E
40|$|Calcium {{hydroxyapatite}} (HAp), {{the main}} constituent of dental enamel, is inherently {{susceptible to the}} <b>etching</b> and dissolving <b>action</b> of acids, resulting in tooth decay such as dental caries and dental erosion. Since the prevalence of erosive wear is gradually increasing, there is urgent need for agents that protect the enamel against erosive attacks. In the present study we studied in vitro the anti-erosive effects {{of a number of}} sphingolipids and sphingoid bases, which form the backbone of sphingolipids. Pretreatment of HAp discs with sphingosine, phytosphingosine (PHS), PHS phosphate and sphinganine significantly protected these against acid-induced demineralization by 80 ± 17 %, 78 ± 17 %, 78 ± 7 % and 81 ± 8 %, respectively (p < 0. 001). On the other hand, sphingomyelin, acetyl PHS, octanoyl PHS and stearoyl PHS had no anti-erosive effects. Atomic force measurement revealed that HAp discs treated with PHS were almost completely and homogeneously covered by patches of PHS. This suggests that PHS and other sphingoid bases form layers on the surface of HAp, which act as diffusion barriers against H+ ions. In principle, these anti-erosive properties make PHS and related sphingosines promising and attractive candidates as ingredients in oral care products...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of crystal face in several electrolytic processes in a copper sulfate-sulfuric acid solution {{has been investigated}} {{with the aid of}} electrolytically polished single crystals of copper. The processes studied consisted of simple chemical <b>etching,</b> electroetching, electro-deposition, <b>action</b> of an alternating current, action of an alternating current superimposed on a direct current, ankl electrolytic replacement.

The nature of the surround-ing atmosphere was found to influence the physical form of the electrodeposit. I NTRODU CT ION The crystal 1 face {{has been shown to be}} an important factor in the following surface processes with metals: etching with liquids 2. 3, 4. 5 * *; oxidation by heating in air e. 7, 8. 8; rearrangements in the surface due to the action of hot gases 9. 10; wetting of the surface of a few metals by certain organic liquids 9; solution potential 11; photoelectric, 12 ther-mionic and field 18 emissions. This investigation was undertaken to determine the influence of crystal face on some of the electrochemical properties of a single crystal of copper.

40|$|Summary Several {{reports have}} {{indicated}} that resin bond strengths to noncarious sclerotic cervical dentine are lower than bonds made to normal dentine. This {{is thought to be}} due to tubule occlusion by mineral salts, preventing resin tag formation. The purpose of this review was to critically examine what is known about the structure of this type of dentine. Recent transmission electron microscopy revealed that in addition to occlusion of the tubules by mineral crystals, many parts of wedge-shaped cervical lesions contain a hypermineralised surface that resists the <b>etching</b> <b>action</b> of both self-etching primers and phosphoric acid. This layer prevents hybridisation of the underlying sclerotic dentine. In addition, bacteria are often detected on top of the hypermineralised layer. Sometimes the bacteria were embedded in a partially mineralised matrix. Acidic conditioners and resins penetrate variable distances into these multilayered structures. Examination of both sides of the failed bonds revealed a wide variation in fracture patterns that involved all of these structures. Microtensile bond strengths to the occlusal, gingival and deepest portions of these wedge-shaped lesions were significantly lower than similar areas artificially prepared in normal teeth. When resin bonds to sclerotic dentine are extended to include peripheral sound dentine, their bond strengths are probably high enough to permit retention of class V restorations by adhesion, without additional retention. q 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
