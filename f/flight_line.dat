A4850, {{fresh from}} its packing crate, was {{extensively}} modified for Ball: in particular {{he had the}} synchronised Vickers machine gun removed, to be replaced with a second Lewis gun fitted to fire downwards through {{the floor of the}} cockpit. He also had a slightly larger fuel tank installed. On 9 April, A4850 was refitted, and the downward-firing Lewis gun removed and replaced by the normal Vickers gun mounting. In a letter to Flora Young on 18 April, Ball mentioned getting his own hut on the <b>flight</b> <b>line,</b> and installing the members of his flight nearby.|$|E

25|$|The {{pervasive}} noise also severely disrupted {{operations in}} the Edwards AFB control tower by risking vibration damage to sensitive components and forcing air traffic personnel {{to communicate with the}} XF-84H's crew on the <b>flight</b> <b>line</b> by light signals. After numerous complaints, the Air Force Flight Test Center directed Republic to tow the aircraft out on Rogers Dry Lake, far from the <b>flight</b> <b>line,</b> before running up its engine. The test program did not proceed further than the manufacturer's Phase I proving flights; consequently, no USAF test pilots flew the XF-84H. With the likelihood that the engine and equipment failures coupled with the inability to reach design speeds and subsequent instability experienced were insurmountable problems, the USAF cancelled the program in September 1956.|$|E

In 1998, the ten <b>flight</b> <b>lines</b> flown in 1993 {{in the south of}} Greenland were resurveyed with about 99 % repeat coverage; <b>flight</b> <b>lines</b> in the north will be resurveyed in 1999.

A network of 24 <b>flight</b> <b>lines</b> were established over the research area. Airborne surveys were flown daily during two intensive field campaigns. The data collected was sufficient to modify the NWS standard operational method for estimating soil moisture for the Field Experiment (FIFE) <b>flight</b> <b>lines.</b> The average root mean square error of the soil moisture estimates for shorter FIFE <b>flight</b> <b>lines</b> was found to be 2. 5 percent, compared with a reported value of 3. 9 percent for NWS <b>flight</b> <b>lines.</b> Techniques were developed to compute soil moisture estimates for portions of the <b>flight</b> <b>lines.</b> Results of comparisons of the airborne gamma radiation soil moisture estimates with those obtained using the NASA Pushbroom Microwave Radiation (PBMR) system and hydrological model are presented. The airborne soil moisture measurements, and real averages computed using all remotely sensed and ground data, have been in support of the research of the many FIFE investigators whose overall goal was the upscale integration of models and the application of satellite remote sensing...|$|R

25|$|Waterpump {{gained a}} new {{responsibility}} in March 1968. A forward air control operation named Raven FACs {{was formed in}} Laos; incoming volunteers were briefed at Waterpump before entering Laos. Still another task was laid upon them on 17 July 1968. Ambassador William H. Sullivan decided to expand the Air Commando Air Operation Centers from four specialists to about 14. The expanded AOC would have an instructor pilot in command, additional Raven FACs as needed, a senior enlisted <b>flight</b> <b>line</b> chief, a medic, a radio operator, an aircraft ordnance specialist, an avionics specialist, a ground support equipment specialist, and two engine mechanics. The latter were assigned to six month TDYs from Waterpump. The AOC expansion was codified as Palace Dog; many experienced Waterpump veterans would return for repeat tours under this program.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner Data (TIMS) was {{collected}} over the H. J.

Surface temperature differences over time between <b>flight</b> <b>lines</b> allowed the development of thermal response numbers (TRN) which characterized the thermal response of the different surface types. The polygons containing mostly soil and bare rock had the lowest TRN whereas the forested polygons were the highest. Results indicate that forest canopy temperatures measured by the TIMS are comparable to needle thermocouples temperatures. ET models developed from the TIMS data obtained similar ET rates as those using energy balance techniques...|$|R

500|$|Throughout his flying service Ball was {{primarily}} a [...] "lone-wolf" [...] pilot, stalking his prey from below until he drew close enough to use his top-wing Lewis gun on its Foster mounting, angled to fire upwards into the enemy's fuselage. [...] According to fellow ace and Victoria Cross recipient James McCudden, [...] "it was quite {{a work of art}} to pull this gun down and shoot upwards, {{and at the same time}} manage one's machine accurately". [...] Ball was as much a loner on the ground as in the air, preferring to stay in his hut on the <b>flight</b> <b>line</b> away from other squadron members. His off-duty hours were spent tending his small garden and practising the violin. [...] Though not unsociable per se, he was extremely sensitive and shy. Ball acted as his own mechanic on his aircraft and, as a consequence, was often untidy and dishevelled. His singularity in dress extended to his habit of flying without a helmet and goggles, and he wore his thick black hair longer than regulations generally permitted.|$|E

50|$|The Gunnery Ranges {{were used}} to train gunners in air-to-air firing. Five target <b>flight</b> <b>lines</b> and two {{auxiliary}} landing fields were established within this range. Initially, gunnery trainees fired at targets towed along these target <b>flight</b> <b>lines.</b> This technique did not provide good training and other techniques were tried. One of the first was to place a gun camera on the machine gun and instead of firing bullets the camera would record the gunners sight picture whenever the trigger was pulled. In this situation, instead of aiming at a towed target sleeve, P-39 and P-63 aircraft were used as targets. Another technique tried involved the use of frangible bullets which were fired at specially armored versions of the P-39 and P-63s. This was called Operation PINBALL.|$|R
40|$|Passive {{microwave}} {{data have}} been used to infer the snow-covered area and snow water equivalent (SWE) over forested areas, but the accuracy of these retrieved snow parameters cannot be easily validated for heterogeneous vegetated regions. The Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study Winter Field Campaign provided the opportunity to study the effect of boreal forests on snow parameter retrieval in detail. Microwave radiometers (18, 37, and 92 GHz) were flown on board the Canadian National Aeronautical Establishment's Twin Otter. <b>Flight</b> <b>lines</b> covered both the southern study area near Prince Albert and the northern study area near Thompson, Canada. During the 1994 winter campaign, extensive ground-based snow cover information, including depth, density, and grain size, was collected along most of the <b>flight</b> <b>lines,</b> jointly by U.

Preliminary results reconfirmed the relationship between microwave brightness temperature and SWE. However, the effect of forest cover observed by the aircraft sensors is {{different from that of the}} satellite observations. This is probably due to the difference in footprint averaging. There were also several <b>flight</b> <b>lines</b> flown over Candle Lake and Waskesiu Lake to assess lake ice signatures. Preliminary results show the thickness of the lake ice may be inferred from the airborne microwave observations.
