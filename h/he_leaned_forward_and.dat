60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> beckoned to Gaston to draw {{his chair}} nearer.|$|E
60|$|She turned towards Julian. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{raised her}} fingers to his lips.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{whispered in}} the comedian's ear. The latter nodded {{and turned to}} the rival bidder.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the answer}} of a child and {{affected}} the judge. He fussed with his papers. Perhaps his task was not easy; certainly it was not pleasant. Then <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> again <b>and</b> fixed those deep, cavernous eyes upon the sad face.|$|R
60|$|Something in {{her voice}} made Blake catch his breath. She looked very {{alluring}} as she sat there {{with the last of}} the sunshine sprinkling gold over her hair and her face and her light gown. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> quickly; <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> remembered his disgrace.|$|R
60|$|It {{was not a}} cheering speech; but all {{the time}} his fat face was wreathed in smiles, and he lisped out his words in the most mincing and amiable fashion. Now, however, <b>he</b> {{suddenly}} <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> I read a very real intensity in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|She {{raised a}} burning face and eyes to his. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{imprinted}} the perfunctory cousinly kiss {{of the period}} upon her cheek.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> searched me {{with his}} keen gray eyes, as tho' {{watching}} {{the effect of the}} intelligence upon me. I was, indeed, stunned.|$|E
6000|$|Kinney laughed mightily; then <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> slapped Bartley on the {{shoulder}} with his newspaper. [...] "Look here!" [...] he exclaimed, [...] "I like you!" ...|$|E
60|$|The steward gasped and, doubting {{whether he}} had heard aright, looked towards his old master, but in vain, for the {{confirmation}} of further compliments. In all his long years of service {{he had never been}} praised by him before. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> eagerly <b>and</b> began to discuss ways and means.|$|R
6000|$|Tip {{was well}} soaked and {{dripping}} water {{from every angle}} of his body. But <b>he</b> managed to <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> shout in the ear of the Saw-Horse: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good egg! Champion idea, Josey, my lass. Eh? What--!" [...] cried Jim. [...] "Why {{not carry}} it out--eh? Why not? Most attractive." [...] <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> over Josephine, <b>and</b> grinned.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Ot temper?" [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "Yes." [...] <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> holding his chilled {{hands over the}} fire stood for some time deep in thought.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Truefitt rumpled {{his hair}} irritably {{and for some}} time sat silent. Then <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and,</b> in a voice {{trembling}} with excitement, whispered in the ladyâ€™s ear.|$|E
60|$|After that he sat {{silent for}} at least a minute, until <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> spoke awhile in a low voice with Dom Clemente who once or twice made a sign of concurrence.|$|E
60|$|Dan {{turned his}} long, lean {{face as if}} to give the speaker a reproachful look; then <b>he</b> groaned again, <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> drew the buggy slowly into the stony lane.|$|R
60|$|Fischer, {{as though}} to give due {{emphasis}} to his statement, indulged in a brief pause. Then <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> a little <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> spoke very slowly and very forcibly.|$|R
50|$|A {{woman named}} Mrs. Balducci {{addresses}} {{the court in}} a Los Angeles courtroom. She asks for leniency for Alex Rich, {{the man who killed}} her son and three other people in a convenience store. The incredulous judge asks her why, because the defendant shows no remorse for his crime. A young woman stands up in the courtroom and asks if remorse would make a difference when someone was guilty of terrible things. The judge orders the woman to sit down, but Mrs. Balducci agrees with her. She says that rather than see Rich put to death, she wants him to be forced to live out his life in prison, endlessly watching videos of his victims' lives. She approaches Rich as she says this, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> bites off the end of her finger. The judge immediately clears the courtroom and reschedules the sentencing, as Rich is dragged away.|$|R
60|$|As {{we stepped}} into the {{carriage}} one of the stable-lads held {{the door open for}} us. A sudden idea seemed to occur to Holmes, for <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> touched the lad upon the sleeve.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly; {{though it}} ought to be plain. Mr. Davies holds a note with my name on it, which I {{understand}} Mr. Gerald Mowbray cannot meet." [...] <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> took the note. [...] "It's due to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr Bethany woke with a start. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> {{stretched}} {{out a long}} black wrinkled sleeve, just managing to reach far enough to tap Lawford's knee. 'Don't worry, don't worry,' he said soothingly. 'We believe, we believe.' ...|$|E
60|$|The Russian {{leaned back}} and lit a cigarette. Yet Reist {{felt that he was}} being watched by those half-closed, sleepy eyes. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> a little <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> lowered his voice.|$|R
60|$|British {{infantry}} {{keep the}} ground. In front are about fifty Frenchmen in civil dress of every grade of life, workmen and gentlemen, {{in a double}} rank. They are all so wounded that they are back in civil life, but to-day they are to have some solace for their wounds. They lean heavily on sticks, their bodies are twisted and maimed, but their faces are shining with pride and joy. The French General draws his sword and addresses them. One catches words like 'honneur' <b>and</b> 'patrie.' They <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> on their crutches, hanging on every syllable which comes hissing and rasping from under that heavy white moustache. Then the medals are pinned on. One poor lad is terribly wounded and needs two sticks. A little girl runs out with some flowers. <b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> tries to kiss her, but the crutches slip and he nearly falls upon her. It was a pitiful but beautiful little scene.|$|R
6000|$|... "And wherein is {{that power}} contained? What view do {{you hold on}} the subject?" [...] Doctor Winchester's voice vibrated with the {{intensity}} of his excitement as <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> breathing hard, <b>and</b> with eyes staring. Mr. Trelawny said solemnly: ...|$|R
6000|$|Sammy Jay {{winked at}} each of the others. He cleared his throat and looked all around, to make sure that no one else was near. Then <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> whispered: [...] "Let's invite {{ourselves}} to the party." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{loyalty of}} Pisani's nature was so affronted by this offer, that, in a fury of rage, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> struck Corbaro a heavy blow with his fist, and then {{raising his voice}} shouted to those about him: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But--but--this I know! This {{is an old}} song! This I {{have heard}} sung! This is a miracle,' Sir Richard interrupted. 'Nay, do not stop!' <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> {{the shadows of the}} leaves slipped and slid upon his chain-mail.|$|E
60|$|He {{was playing}} with an {{ornament}} on the shelf, and his fingers tightened convulsively around it. It snapped in two in his hand; he did not notice it. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> towards her, <b>and</b> his strong voice vibrated with feeling.|$|R
6000|$|The {{blind man}} passed his hand lightly over the poor fellow's face, and finding that his elbows were {{planted on the}} table, that his chin rested on his two hands, that <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> eagerly <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> that his whole manner {{expressed}} the utmost interest and anxiety, paused for a minute as though he desired the widow to observe this fully, and then made answer: ...|$|R
60|$|And a faint {{thrill of}} {{surprise}} passed through me. For {{the affairs of}} the nation moved him so much more strongly than his own. His voice already had a different ring, his eyes a different look. <b>He</b> eagerly <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> his long, straight backbone looked longer and straighter than ever. He was less the ghost of a man. A faint flush even had come into his pale cheeks, and he moved his well-kept hands emphatically.|$|R
6000|$|All the geniality {{had faded}} out of Whittington's face. It was purple with rage, and the veins stood {{out on the}} forehead. And behind it all there lurked a sort of incredulous dismay. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> hissed savagely: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{touched a}} spring. The false {{back of the}} cabinet, with its little array of flies, spinners, fishing hooks and tackle, slowly rolled back. Before them stood a huge chart, wonderfully {{executed}} in red, white and yellow.|$|E
6000|$|He {{spoke to}} Mrs. Montgomery, but Cornelia {{knew he was}} talking at her. Now <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{addressed}} her across Mrs. Montgomery: [...] "Do' know as I told you that I saw your mother in Lakeland day before yesterday, Miss Saunders." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{publisher}} {{turned his}} chair round towards the fire. He {{was a man}} of barely middle age, although his black hair was besprinkled with grey and growing a little thin at the temples. His features were good, but his face was a little thin, and his clothes were scarcely as tidy, or the appointments of his office so comfortable as his name and position in the publishing world might have warranted. Marcia, who had been looking at him while <b>he</b> read, <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> brushed the cigarette ash from his coat sleeve.|$|R
60|$|The boy was now free, and the thorn {{which the}} Loon had stuck into his leg was lying unnoticed on the ground, where the {{creature}} had dropped it when <b>he</b> exploded. Woot <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{picked up the}} thorn, and while the Loons were busy watching the pump, the boy sprang {{to his feet and}} suddenly rushed upon the group.|$|R
60|$|She turned {{towards the}} girl as she spoke, and Wrayson fancied {{that there was}} some subtle meaning in the swift glance which passed between the two. Almost involuntarily <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> once more <b>and</b> looked downwards. Heneage's inscrutable face was still upturned in their direction. There was nothing to be read there, not even curiosity. As the eyes of the two men met, Heneage rose and left his seat.|$|R
