5|$|Mrs. Tittlemouse {{is a tale}} {{in which}} no humans play a part and one in which events are treated as though they have {{occurred}} since time immemorial and far from human observance. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> story, and one likely to appeal to young children.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> matter to {{distinguish}} between the yield of natural agents and that of improvements is fanciful and confusing.... The objective classification of land and capital as natural and artificial agents is a task that always must transcend the human power of discrimination.|$|E
5|$|A common {{claim of}} creationists is that {{evolution}} {{has never been}} observed. Challenges to such objections often come down to debates over how evolution is defined (see the Defining evolution section above). Under the conventional biological definition of evolution, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, {{in the form of}} populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, mice, and bacteria in the laboratory, and of tilapia in the field. Such studies on experimental evolution, particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, {{especially in the case of}} antibiotic resistance.|$|E
25|$|The Cold Bath {{built around}} 1723 to Vanbrugh's design, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> brick {{structure}} {{located near the}} Cascade. Demolished by 1761.|$|R
50|$|In 1900, {{they both}} {{constructed}} {{the church in}} the Philippines. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> bamboo chapel at Castilla Street in Jaro City, Iloilo.|$|R
50|$|In 1897 Jeffery {{built his}} first automobile, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> single {{cylinder}} car with bicycle wheels. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> forerunner of the 1901 Rambler Model A.|$|R
5|$|Poohsticks is a sport first {{mentioned}} in The House at Pooh Corner, a Winnie-the-Pooh book by A. A. Milne. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> sport {{which may be}} played on any bridge over running water; each player drops a stick on the upstream side of a bridge and the one whose stick first appears on the downstream side is the winner. The annual World Poohsticks Championships have been held at Day's Lock on the River Thames in the UK since 1984.|$|E
5|$|Rhys {{meets with}} Jim Dolan {{for his first}} round of {{chemotherapy}} and assures him <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> procedure. He learns Karl and Susan Kennedy have been giving Jim advice about his treatment and he asks them to stop. A few days later, Jim informs Rhys {{that he wants to}} stop the chemotherapy. Rhys meets Kate Ramsay at the local bar and they have a one-night stand. During his rounds, Rhys checks on Jim and stays with him as he dies. Affected by Jim's death, Rhys goes to the gym looking for distraction and he befriends Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan). Rhys flirts with Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita), but she rebuffs his advances. Jade later asks for Rhys' help in getting her housemate, Michelle Tran (HaiHa Le), to move out. Nurse Danielle Paquette (Georgia Bolton) questions Karl and Rhys about a mistake on an unsigned prescription form and Rhys covers for Karl. He then asks Karl if he can join his golf game with Martin Chambers, the head of surgery. Kyle invites Rhys to move in with him and Jade and he accepts. Kyle defends Rhys when he flirts with Steve Barnes' (Nicholas Gunn) girlfriend, but he refuses to listen when Rhys tells him to walk away. Steve punches Kyle, who becomes angry with Rhys for leaving him. Rhys apologises and hires a cleaner for the house to make it up to Kyle.|$|E
5|$|Scully visits Kresge, {{wanting to}} look further into Roberta Sim's suicide, {{despite the fact}} that the police think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> suicide. Scully finds a {{striking}} resemblance between the Sims' daughter, Emily, and her sister Melissa from when she was that age. Scully flashes back to a funeral she attended when she was a little girl but imagines Marshall Sim holding her hand. Scully insists on performing an autopsy on Roberta, thinking that she was murdered. Scully finds a needle puncture in Roberta's foot, causing her to believe that she was anesthetized and her suicide was staged. The police search the Sim's house and find a used hypodermic needle, which Marshall claims was used for injecting the anemic Emily with treatment. Scully spots the dark-suited men watching from a nearby car. Scully receives DNA data on Melissa, and matching it up to Emily's finds them nearly identical, causing her to believe that Emily is Melissa's daughter. Scully believes that Melissa gave birth to her while on the west coast and gave her up for adoption without ever telling the rest of the family. Scully flashes back to when she and Melissa were teenagers and were given cross necklaces from their mother for Christmas.|$|E
50|$|Because of its {{heritage}} as <b>a</b> cut-down IIci, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> modification {{to substitute}} a new clock crystal {{to increase the}} system's clock rate to 25 MHz for {{a slight increase in}} performance.|$|R
50|$|In 1885, IWC {{manufactured}} {{the first}} digital watch {{based on a}} patent granted to an Austrian {{by the name of}} Pallweber. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> design, but <b>was</b> unable to replace the traditional analogue display.|$|R
50|$|A.V. Roe's Type 621 Tutor <b>was</b> <b>a</b> two-seat British radial-engined biplane {{from the}} interwar period. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> but rugged initial trainer {{that was used}} by the Royal Air Force as well as many other air arms worldwide.|$|R
25|$|The {{appearance}} of the double cross in coins before Béla III is highly disputed. According to recent view <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> misinterpretation of two normal crosses.|$|E
25|$|He {{demonstrated}} {{the resolution of}} forces before Pierre Varignon, which had not been remarked previously, even though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> consequence {{of the law of}} their composition.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> {{exercise}} {{to prove that}} Legendre's and Gauss's statements are equivalent – it requires {{no more than the}} first supplement and the facts about multiplying residues and nonresidues.|$|E
50|$|Golant {{railway station}} was opened on 1 July 1896 by the Great Western Railway. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> {{platform}} on the waterside {{at the south}} end of Golant village, next to a level crossing that gave access to a slipway.|$|R
50|$|Between 2004 and 2006, the {{interchange}} at milepost 121 {{in the far}} northern {{reaches of}} Columbus was reconstructed to allow access to the eastern extension of Gemini Place. Before that, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> diamond interchange with Polaris Parkway (Ohio State Route 750).|$|R
25|$|What {{strikes the}} {{commentators}} of this text {{is that this}} large tribe is unknown to posterity, unless <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> misspelling or misreading of Illa Svionum gente. This would make sense, since a large Scandinavian tribe named the Suiones was known to the Romans.|$|R
25|$|There was a Norman chapel of St Julitta at the castle, now in ruins, {{which was}} {{excavated}} in Ralegh Radford's excavations. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> rectangular {{building and the}} chancel is of a later date than the nave.|$|E
25|$|A {{version of}} SimCity 3000, {{known simply as}} SimCity, was {{released}} in 2008 for the iPhone and iPod Touch. This version lacks some of the greater details seen in the series. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> version of the other games in the more recent SimCity series. It is no longer offered on the iTunes App Store.|$|E
25|$|The chapel {{was built}} in the early 1950s and is {{dedicated}} to Saint Francis, who so inspired Springvale School’s first headmaster, Canon Robert Grinham. It is built of brick, rough plastered and white painted; its internal pillars are gum poles, as are the beams which support the thatched roof. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> building; a no-nonsense expression of the Christian faith.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} December 1818, the Mermaid {{sailed to}} Van Diemens Land (now Tasmania) to survey the Derwent River and the eastern coast to Macquarie Harbour. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> task, and {{they were back in}} Sydney by the middle of February 1819.|$|R
50|$|By February 1910, {{construction}} {{began on}} the theater. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> plan: <b>a</b> wooden proscenium stage with a scrim of pines and plain wooden benches. Meanwhile, Heron was busying organizing the first production {{with the help of}} the newly minted Forest Theater Society.|$|R
50|$|Goebbels and Göring purged the SA in Berlin and environs. Since all {{money for}} SA was {{dispensed}} through the Gau headquarters, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> matter to cut this {{off and the}} lack of funding caused the rebellion to collapse. Stennes was expelled from the party.|$|R
25|$|JSON-RPC is {{a remote}} {{procedure}} call (RPC) protocol built on JSON, {{as a replacement for}} XML-RPC or SOAP. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> protocol that defines only a handful of data types and commands. JSON-RPC lets a system send notifications (information to the server that does not require a response) and multiple calls to the server that can be answered out of order.|$|E
25|$|If a Poisson point {{process has}} an {{intensity}} measure {{that is a}} locally finite and diffuse (or non-atomic), then <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> point process. For a simple point process, {{the probability of a}} point existing at a single point or location in the underlying (state) space is either zero or one. This implies that, with probability one, no two (or more) points of a Poisson point process coincide in location in the underlying space.|$|E
25|$|Trinity Hall (1865) is {{constructed}} out of handmade bricks laid in a flemish bond pattern. The building {{is constructed}} {{in a modest}} rendition of the Victorian Academic style of architecture and is decorated externally with modest tourelles in cement render and has a rendered string course. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> building with a timber roof. The interior walls are of white render and there are small stained glass windows with simple coloured panes, with a large trefoil window facing south. It has jarrah woodwork throughout.|$|E
50|$|ENQUIRE <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{software}} project {{written in}} 1980 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, {{which was the}} predecessor to the World Wide Web. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> hypertext program that {{had some of the}} same ideas as the Web and the Semantic Web but was different in several important ways.|$|R
2500|$|For Glazer, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> {{reality that}} could not be denied, but he {{remained}} deeply ambivalent about multiculturalism, arguing that it [...] "is not a phase we can embrace wholeheartedly, and I hope my own sense of regret that we have come to this will not escape the reader." ...|$|R
50|$|From {{the first}} seismograms, as {{seen on the}} figure, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> noticed that the trace was divided into two major portions. The first seismic wave to arrive was the P-wave, {{followed}} closely by the S-wave. Knowing the relative 'velocities of propagation', <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> matter to calculate {{the distance of the}} earthquake.|$|R
25|$|In {{a channel}} transupport system, several {{proteins}} form a contiguous channel traversing {{the inner and}} outer membranes of the bacteria. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> system, which consists of only three protein subunits: the ABC protein, membrane fusion protein (MFP), and outer membrane protein (OMP). This secretion system transports various molecules, from ions, drugs, to proteins of various sizes (20 – 900 kDa). The molecules secreted vary in size from the small Escherichia coli peptide colicin V, (10 kDa) to the Pseudomonas fluorescens cell adhesion protein LapA of 900 kDa.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, Jensen's inequality, {{named after}} the Danish {{mathematician}} Johan Jensen, relates {{the value of a}} convex function of an integral to the integral of the convex function. It was proven by Jensen in 1906. Given its generality, the inequality appears in many forms depending on the context, some of which are presented below. In its simplest form the inequality states that the convex transformation of a mean is {{less than or equal to}} the mean applied after convex transformation; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> corollary that the opposite is true of concave transformations.|$|E
25|$|During the Yayoi {{period the}} Japanese {{people began to}} {{interact}} with the Chinese Han Dynasty, whose knowledge and technical skills began to influence them. The Japanese began to build raised-floor storehouses as granaries which were constructed using metal tools like saws and chisels that began to appear at this time. A reconstruction in Toro, Shizuoka is a wooden box made of thick boards joined in the corners in a log cabin style and supported on eight pillars. The roof is thatched but, unlike the typically hipped roof of the pit dwellings, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> V-shaped gable.|$|E
50|$|His {{cremation}} {{was held}} at the Golders Green Crematorium in North London. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> affair attended by just Queen Ramphai and a handful of close relatives. Queen Ramphaiphanni stayed at Compton House for a further eight years before she returned to Thailand in 1949, bringing the king's ashes back with her.|$|R
2500|$|The well {{originally}} had two cisterns {{in the first}} era, one for drinking and one for ablution. At that time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> well surrounded by a fence of stones. Then {{in the era of}} the Abbasid caliph Al-Mansur 771AD (154/155AH) <b>a</b> dome <b>was</b> built above the well, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> tiled with marble.|$|R
2500|$|The first certain {{document}} in Albanian [...] "Formula e pagëzimit" [...] (1462) (Baptesimal formula), issued by Pal Engjëlli, (1417–1470) {{was written in}} Latin characters. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> phrase that <b>was</b> supposed {{to be used by}} the relatives of a dying person if they couldn't make it to churches during the troubled times of the Ottoman invasion.|$|R
