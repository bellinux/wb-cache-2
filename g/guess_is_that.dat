25|$|Shortly {{after its}} initial exhibition, Fountain was lost. According to Duchamp biographer Calvin Tomkins, the best <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it {{was thrown out}} as rubbish by Stieglitz, a common fate of Duchamp's early readymades.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no natural}} {{candidate}} {{for what might}} cause {{what has been called}} dark energy but the current best <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is the zero-point energy of the vacuum. One difficulty with this assumption is that the zero-point energy of the vacuum is absurdly large compared to the observed cosmological constant. In general relativity, mass and energy are equivalent; both produce a gravitational field and therefore the theorized vacuum energy of quantum field theory should have led the universe ripping itself to pieces. This obviously has not happened and this issue, called the cosmological constant problem, {{is one of the greatest}} unsolved mysteries in physics.|$|E
500|$|When {{creative}} writing professor Lisa Norris, who taught Cho in both Advanced Fiction Writing and Contemporary Fiction, {{was asked about}} him by Mary Ann Lewis, associate dean for Liberal Arts and Human Sciences, she was not told that {{he was suffering from}} mental health problems or about prior police reports concerning his harassment of female students. According to Norris, [...] "my <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> either the information was not accessible to her [...] or it was privileged and could not be released to me." [...] Lewis told Norris to recommend that Cho seek counseling at the on-campus Cook Counseling Center, as Lewis had already done.|$|E

50|$|T. H. Howard-Hill made {{an attempt}} to {{reconstruct}} the casting of the play's other roles, based on {{what is known about}} the personnel of the King's Men in 1619 and the types of roles they took. His least uncertain <b>guesses</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> John Lowin most likely played Barnavelt, and Joseph Taylor the Prince of Orange.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here {{is quite}} a view!" [...] {{announced}} Shadow, and they spent a little time in taking in the panorama spread before them. On one side they could see Mirror Lake, {{and on the other}} the nearby mountains and also a faraway wagon-road, which they rightly <b>guessed</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> running to Carpen Falls and the villages beyond.|$|R
500|$|The book is 15,000 words {{long and}} was first {{published}} in January 2011 as an electronic book only, priced at USD$4. The Economist noted that the [...] "publishing model is fascinating in its own right". A hardback version, which Cowen dubbed [...] "the retrogression", was published in June 2011. Yglesias described the publication as an innovation in [...] "current affairs publishing" [...] and [...] "much shorter and cheaper than a conventional book in a way that actually leaves you wanting to read more once you finish it. My <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this is the future of books." [...] The book has been compared to economic and political pamphlets of the 17th century, which were frequently used to quickly get ideas about current affairs into circulation.|$|E
500|$|In 1962, {{the book}} was {{published}} in Britain. Siriol Hugh-Jones wrote for The Times Literary Supplement, [...] "The Phantom Tollbooth is something every adult seems sure will turn into a modern Alice... The obvious <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the appeal {{of this sort of}} writing is directed towards just the sort of adults who derive a perfectly grown-up pleasure from regularly rereading the Alices. As one might expect, it is illustrated by every grown-up's favourite child-like pictures with the built-in sad sophistication, the work of Jules Feiffer." [...] Jennifer Bourdillon reviewed it for The Listener, [...] "This is the story of an imaginary journey, a sort of Pilgrim's Progress of a little boy in his car... One would hardly have thought from the sound of this that it would have so magnetic an appeal, but the brilliant verbal humour and the weird and wonderful characters (the Dodecahedron. the Watchdog, Faintly Macabre) make it that rare delight, a book which parents and children can share." [...] It reached Australia in 1963; The Canberra Times reviewer, J.E.B., deemed it memorable, causing readers to quote from it and leaf through its pages again.|$|E
2500|$|The film's opening {{scenes are}} not great filmmaking. They're heavy on jargon and impenetrable calculation, murky and heavy on theory. [...] My <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{much of the}} fascination with this film is {{inspired}} by the unveiling of facts, unclearly seen. There isn't {{a whole lot of}} plot– basically, just that Maya thinks she is right, and she is.|$|E
500|$|Alfred Eisenack's {{original}} <b>guess</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Chitinozoa <b>were</b> of the rhizopod order Testacea, since similar chitin-based {{tests were}} {{produced by the}} [...] members of this group. However, the chemistry of these tests {{differs from that of}} the fossils, and modern Testacea are almost exclusively fresh-water - an extremely different environment. Within a year, he had abandoned this initial idea.|$|R
5000|$|During the Television Critics Association press tour, FOX Entertainment {{president}} Peter Ligouri addressed reporters {{regarding the}} show's abrupt end. Ligouri stated {{there were several}} ways {{to go with the}} killer's identity. However, [...] "the best <b>guess</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> particular time <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> going to be Sam's daughter", whom she gave up for adoption early in the series. The reason why the murder occurred still remains a mystery.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{with another}} {{satellite}} {{planned to be}} launched, it <b>was</b> determined <b>that</b> a space walk by a subsequent Shuttle crew {{might be able to}} [...] "wake" [...] the craft. The best <b>guess</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a switch had failed to turn on the satellite. A [...] "bypass box" [...] was hastily constructed, NASA was excited to offer assistance, the customer was supportive, and the insurance underwriters agreed to fund the attempt at space salvage - a first.|$|R
2500|$|He {{has lived}} in a Turtle Bay, Manhattan brownstone since writing Gypsy in 1959. Ten years later, while he was playing music he heard {{a knock on the}} door. His neighbor, Katharine Hepburn, was in [...] "bare feet – this angry, red-faced lady" [...] and told him [...] "You have been keeping me awake all night!" [...] (she was {{practicing}} for her musical debut in Coco). When Sondheim asked why she had not asked him to play for her, she said she lost his phone number. According to Sondheim, [...] "My <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she wanted to stand there in her bare feet, suffering for her art".|$|E
2500|$|In a Washington Post profile a {{few months}} after the September trip, Bronfman laid out what he thought had been {{accomplished}} during his September meetings. He said, [...] "There's going to be a buildup of pressure through the business community. The Russians know the Soviet Jewry issue is tied to trade ... My <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> over a period of time, five to ten years, some of our goals will be achieved." [...] Author Gal Beckerman says in his When They Come For Us We'll Be Gone, [...] "Bronfman had a business man's understanding of the Soviet Jewish issue. It was all a matter of negotiation, of calculating what the Russians really wanted and leveraging that against emigration." ...|$|E
2500|$|Estimates of {{when the}} peak {{population}} of mustangs occurred and total numbers vary widely between sources. No comprehensive census of feral horse numbers was ever performed until {{the time of the}} Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 and any earlier estimates, particularly prior to the 20th century, are speculative. Some sources simply state that [...] "millions" [...] of mustangs once roamed western North America. [...] In 1959, geographer Tom L. McKnight suggested that the population peaked in the late 1700s or early 1800s, and the [...] "best guesses apparently lie between two and five million". Historian J. Frank Dobie hypothesized that the population peaked around the end of the Mexican–American War in 1848, stating, [...] "My own <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> at no time were there more than a million mustangs in Texas and no more than a million others scattered over the remainder of the West." [...] J. Edward de Steiguer questioned Dobie's lower guess as still being too high.|$|E
5000|$|Following the 2006 NFL season, rumors {{circulated}} that Ferentz {{may have}} been in consideration for the Pittsburgh Steelers' head coaching job after Bill Cowher stepped down. However, before Cowher's departure, Ferentz was asked about his possible interest in the position, and stated: [...] "I know that staff pretty well and they've got some good guys in <b>that</b> building. My <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that's</b> where they would go. But I’m not interested, and I doubt they are, either. I’ve got a great job right here." [...] The Steelers job eventually went to Mike Tomlin.|$|R

5000|$|... "Pain In My Heart - {{this was}} written {{some time ago}} not long after I lost my old man and I <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> about <b>that.</b> It's <b>been</b> slowly put {{together}} over time, {{so much so that}} most of the recording was already done, all we did was add some real piano." ...|$|R
60|$|Guess again. Perhaps it {{was there}} always, from the {{beginning}} of the world? My dear child, you have no proof of that either. Everything round you is changing in shape daily and hourly, as you will find out the longer you live; and therefore it is most reasonable to suppose that this glen has changed its shape, as everything else on earth has done. Besides, I told you not that Madam How had made the glen, but that she was making it, and as yet has only half finished. That is my first guess; and my next <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> water is making the glen--water, and nothing else.|$|E
60|$|But while Emily Brontë was as unsociable as a storm at midnight, {{and while}} Charlotte Brontë was at best like that warmer and more {{domestic}} thing, {{a house on}} fire--they do connect themselves with the calm of George Eliot, as the forerunners of many later developments of the feminine advance. Many forerunners (if it comes to that) would have felt rather ill if they had seen the things they foreran. This notion of a hazy anticipation of after history has been absurdly overdone: as when men connect Chaucer with the Reformation; which is like connecting Homer with the Syracusan Expedition. But it is to some extent true that all these great Victorian women {{had a sort of}} unrest in their souls. And the proof of it is that (after what I will claim to call the healthier time of Dickens and Thackeray) it began to be admitted by the great Victorian men. If there had not been something in that irritation, we should hardly have had to speak in these pages of Diana of the Crossways or of Tess of the D'Urbervilles. To what this strange and very local sex war has been due I shall not ask, because I have no answer. That it was due to votes or even little legal inequalities about marriage, I feel myself here too close to realities even to discuss. My own <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it has been due to the great neglect of the military spirit by the male Victorians. The woman felt obscurely that she was still running her mortal risk, while the man was not still running his. But I know nothing about it; nor does anybody else.|$|E
50|$|The <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he died around 1927, {{though some}} stories still have him {{alive in the}} 1930s. He was buried in Libau, Manitoba.|$|E
60|$|Not {{many days}} later the wolf's grandmother, who, {{with the help of}} her relations, had been searching for him everywhere, entered the cottage to buy some sea-urchins' eggs, and saw the skin, which she at once <b>guessed</b> to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> of her grandson.|$|R
5000|$|Democrats {{were also}} {{critical}} of the negotiating process. House Minority Leader Frank Dermody lividly complained that Republicans didn't share their proposed plan until Monday. [...] "And my <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> clearly <b>that</b> my colleague had a significant more amount time to review the plan. Frankly, I look at is as a classic bait and switch," [...] Dermody said.|$|R
6000|$|Devine smiled drily. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> my business. Now {{is there}} any special reason you shouldn't borrow those dollars from me?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Robert Solovay conjectured: [...] "My <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he Gödel {{wished to}} avoid a {{discussion}} of the technicalities involved in developing the rudiments of model theory within axiomatic set theory." ...|$|E

5000|$|During {{the debate}} over whether to accept Haitian {{refugees}} following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Krikorian wrote: [...] "My <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Haiti's so screwed up because it wasn't colonized long enough." ...|$|E
5000|$|Maryna and Serhiy {{claim that}} the bulk of their work is [...] "M"-realism (a {{possible}} <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] "M" [...] stands for magic, but it was never confirmed by either author).|$|E
5000|$|Whether {{the lake}} is formed {{naturally}} or artificially is unknown. One <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the lake was built in ancient times for serving agricultural irrigation nearby, most likely during the Ming Dynasty.|$|E
