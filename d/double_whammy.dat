Despite {{the fact that the}} board was now more random (host Todd Newton called it [...] "Larson-proof"), {{and there was no way}} the same trick could have been performed, Long and Litras (who had remarried and took the surname Litras-Dakan) still lost.

40|$|The work {{presented}} here investigated the length effect in nonword reading aloud {{in order to}} assess whether that effect is driven by the number of letters in a string or by the number of graphemes in a string. Simulation work with the DualRoute Cascaded (DRC) model (e. g., Coltheart, Curtis, Atkins, & Haller, 1993; Coltheart & Rastle, 1994) uncovered a surprising finding regarding the length effect; the same result was obtained in an experiment with human subjects.

5000|$|As {{a result}} of the lyrical message, the Chicago Tribune of 10 May 1987, stated [...] "For most pop singers, hearing one of their songs played on the radio is cause for {{unbridled}} elation. But the Thompson Twins' Alannah Currie has decidedly mixed emotions when it comes to [...] "Long Goodbye," [...] the British band's next single. Chances are that the ballad - the scheduled follow-up to the Thompsons Twins' current Top 40 hit, the danceable [...] "Get That Love" [...] - will get its share of airplay; the Twins, who have sold more than 20 million records in the last five years, are a proven pop force. But Currie won't be listening to the song that probably means more to her than any other she's ever written. While there's a line in [...] "Long Goodbye" [...] about seeing both the future and the past die, you wouldn't know - unless Currie told you - that the song was triggered by the <b>double</b> emotional <b>whammy</b> she suffered last year: Her much-loved mother died on the same day the singer lost the baby she and fellow Thompson Twin Tom Bailey were eagerly expecting. Currie stated [...] "I can't hear it without crying. I'll turn the radio off when it comes on. I skip that song on the album. It's weird to me that they're releasing it as a single, because for me it's a grieving song. I spent all of last summer crying. It was an awful time, and I put a lot of my feelings into that song. It was like a parting gift - I believe that people continue on spiritually after they die - and it was nice to write a tribute to my mother, who was so wonderful. But it was sad, and it was impossible to separate my feelings about my mother's death and the miscarriage. [...] "Long Goodbye" [...] is all of those things condensed into something quite subtle and quite painful. It's all okay now, I'm okay, and I'm looking forward to having children in the future. But... I still can't bear to listen to that song." ...|$|R
