25|$|Taliban decision-makers, {{particularly}} Mullah Omar, seldom if <b>ever</b> <b>talked</b> {{directly to}} non-Muslim foreigners, so aid providers {{had to deal}} with intermediaries whose approvals and agreements were often reversed. Around September 1997 the heads of three UN agencies in Kandahar were expelled from the country after protesting when a female attorney for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees was forced to talk from behind a curtain so her face would not be visible.|$|E
25|$|Nowhere has Channel Nine <b>ever</b> <b>talked</b> the one-day game down, nowhere have we {{ever said}} this is a 'B team'. It's rubbish and George should stick to playing cricket and leave (television) rights to the people who know what they're talking about. I reckon he's got his hands full as it is. He needs to {{concentrate}} on staying in the side. And he needs to understand where his money's coming from. Without the TV rights deal, George is probably working in a coalmine or flipping burgers at McDonald's.|$|E
500|$|According to Questlove, a duet track by D'Angelo and Lauryn Hill, [...] "Feel Like Makin' Love", was planned. Although {{tapes were}} sent via FedEx between the two, the {{collaboration}} was aborted {{and the song}} was instead recorded by D'Angelo. Questlove later said that the duet failed to materialize due to [...] "too many middle men [...] I don't think Lauryn and D <b>ever</b> <b>talked</b> face-to-face." [...] Mistakenly, some critics who reviewed the final track assumed that Hill's vocals {{are present in the}} recording.|$|E

500|$|The {{book also}} {{explains}} {{the philosophy of}} social determinism held by those Dalrymple interviewed, and how the welfare state and the socialist tenets within it help feed this mindset. However, Dalrymple never directly accuses socialism and the welfare state in his essays, instead focusing on the beliefs and reasons for why the patients and inmates take the destructive actions that they did. This is expressed with determinism in {{that they believe that}} their actions must be based on their childhoods or the failure of society in the past to help them. Those patients that Dalrymple speaks with [...] "seem surprised and tell him that he's the first person they've <b>ever</b> <b>talked</b> to who suggests that they can change their lives for the better," [...] further emphasising the mindset in which their society has placed them.|$|E
500|$|An inquest into Shaw's death {{commenced}} in Exeter {{shortly after}} her death was reported to the coroner. The inquest heard evidence in late 2009, among which was eyewitness testimony that the team manager, a teacher from Edgehill College, had met with the group the morning of Shaw's death. During the meeting, the group asked to end the training hike early, but they were instructed by the teacher to carry on. However, the group's navigator gave evidence that she and Shaw had been happy to continue the expedition. The possibility was also raised by other group members that the group was under-prepared for the conditions they faced. The group member whose bag Shaw had been attempting to throw across the stream told the coroner [...] "We were not told how to cross swollen rivers. We were told how to check how deep it was but we were never told how to cross them. Nobody <b>ever</b> <b>talked</b> to us about using ropes".|$|E
500|$|The band's {{debut album}} {{warranted}} a Parental Advisory label {{because of the}} album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song [...] "Daddy" [...] was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: [...] "When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went to my parents and told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really {{like to talk about}} that song. This is as much as I've <b>ever</b> <b>talked</b> about it..." [...] "Kill You" [...] was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his step mother. Follow the Leader marked the first album where the majority of the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like [...] "Justin" [...] and [...] "Pretty" [...] written about incidents occurring during adulthood.|$|E
