5|$|The {{airport was}} inaugurated on 15 May 2010 by then Chief Minister B. S. Yeddyurappa. Many {{airlines}} remained reluctant to begin flights, expecting poor passenger numbers and taking {{issue with the}} airport's inability to handle jet aircraft. Ultimately, <b>Kingfisher</b> Airlines announced it would introduce flights from Chennai via Bangalore in October, just {{before the start of}} Dasara. The flights were operated by <b>Kingfisher</b> Red. However, <b>Kingfisher</b> discontinued service to Mysore the following November. Although the flights had performed well during Dasara, occupancy declined thereafter. In addition, <b>Kingfisher</b> was dealing with financial problems and had decided to end <b>Kingfisher</b> Red operations.|$|E
5|$|On 23 February 2010, India's <b>Kingfisher</b> Airlines {{took its}} {{first step to}} joining Oneworld with its {{chairman}} Vijay Mallya and chief executives from the alliance's existing member airlines signing a memorandum of understanding, subject to Indian regulatory approval. The airline gained approval to join the alliance from the India's Ministry of Civil Aviation and started participating in the alliance's Global Explorer round-the-world fare product. However, on 3 February 2012, just a week before {{it was due to}} join the alliance, <b>Kingfisher</b> Airlines' entry was put on hold to give it more time to strengthen its financial position. <b>Kingfisher</b> Airlines suspended operations on 20 October 2012 and finally ceased operations in February 2013.|$|E
5|$|Designs were {{submitted}} {{in response to}} the Navy's specifications by Vought-Sikorsky and Curtiss-Wright. The Vought design, designated Model 403 by the company, was similar to the company's OS2U <b>Kingfisher,</b> which was then under development to replace the SOC aboard U.S. Navy battleships, but had its monoplane wing moved higher on the fuselage than that of the <b>Kingfisher,</b> and differed in the attachment method used by its single-float landing gear. In addition, the radial engine of the OS2U was replaced by an inline Ranger V-770 in a squared-off cowling.|$|E

5|$|In June 1942, the US Navy Bureau of Aeronautics {{requested}} industry {{proposals for}} a new seaplane to replace the <b>Kingfisher</b> and Curtiss SO3C Seamew. The new aircraft was required {{to be able to}} use landing gear as well as floats. Curtiss submitted a design on 1 August, and received a contract for two prototypes and five service-test aircraft on 25 August. The first flight of a prototype XSC-1 took place on 16 February 1944 at the Columbus, Ohio Curtiss plant. The first production aircraft were delivered in October 1944, and by the beginning of 1945 the single-seat Curtiss SC Seahawk floatplane began replacing the <b>Kingfisher.</b> Had the Montana class been completed, they would have arrived around the time of this replacement, and would likely have been equipped with the Seahawk for use in combat operations and seaborne search and rescue.|$|E

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] As a {{strategy}} for recovering imperiled species in the wild, captive breeding has achieved measured success. Specifically, captivity often involves sources of stress that can cause unfavorable conditions, including inhibition of growth, immunity, and reproduction. High stress may {{be a factor in}} the limited success of the breeding program for Guam <b>kingfishers</b> (Todiramphus cinnamominus). We investigated how stress, as evidenced by corticosterone in feathers, in Guam <b>kingfishers</b> was related to reproduction and captive conditions. Current techniques for measuring corticosterone present challenges and limitations. Therefore, we first developed and validated an alternative protocol for extracting and measuring corticosterone from feathers. We then compared corticosterone of captive birds with that of wild congeneric <b>kingfishers,</b> and we compared corticosterone to breeding success in captive <b>kingfishers.</b> Next, we developed models to examine the effect of captive conditions on corticosterone in Guam <b>kingfishers.</b> Results indicated that corticosterone of captive and wild <b>kingfishers</b> did not differ. Reproductively successful male Guam <b>kingfishers</b> had lower corticosterone than unsuccessful males, but we found no evidence of an effect on breeding in females. Finally, models indicated that variables related to climate and enclosure size affected corticosterone in the birds. Using these results, we provide a discussion of how management might be altered to reduce stress in the <b>kingfishers.</b> We hope that implementation of new techniques will improve breeding...|$|R

5|$|The Vought OS2U <b>Kingfisher</b> was {{a lightly}} armed two-man {{aircraft}} designed in 1937.

5|$|After its {{unexpected}} redevelopment over Oklahoma, widespread {{damage was}} also reported there. Several communities in central Oklahoma were flooded {{due to the}} heavy rainfall. Watonga, <b>Kingfisher</b> and Geary were the hardest-hit communities, where many houses and buildings were inundated. The weather forced the cancellation of the Hydro Fair as the carnival rides were not safe in heavy rain and high wind. Winds in Watonga gusted as high as 82mph (131km/h), which damaged numerous trees and power lines and heavily damaged mobile homes. The entire community lost power, as did about 15,000 customers in total in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. A section of Interstate 40 was also closed for a while.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the engine}} issues, the SO2U-1 was {{considered}} overall {{to be superior}} to the competing Curtiss XSO3C-1; however, Vought's production capacity was already taken up by manufacture of the OS2U <b>Kingfisher</b> scout and F4U Corsair fighter. As a result, the XSO3C was declared {{the winner of the}} contract, and was ordered into production. Named Seagull by the U.S. Navy, and Seamew by the Royal Navy, the SO3C developed a disastrous reputation in service, and was retired before the SOC biplane which it was intended to replace.|$|E
