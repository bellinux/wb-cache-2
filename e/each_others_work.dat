50|$|In 1920 Clerici {{moved to}} Rome, {{where he studied}} at the Scuola Superiore di Architettura, and {{obtained}} an architecture degree in 1937. The Roman monuments, architecture and paintings from the Italian Renaissance and the baroque period considerably influence him, as did certain religious works, due to their spectacular aspect. Later, Sonno romano (1955) would reawaken those memories. In Rome he attended conferences by Le Corbusier, and in 1936 he became a friend of Alberto Savinio; they admired <b>each</b> <b>others</b> <b>work.</b> In 1938 he met Giorgio de Chirico in Milan. At {{the end of the}} 1930s he made his first dreamlike and fantastic paintings, based on his memory of events, locations and persons transformed by the filter of time. Through his reconstruction of images, Clerici evolved naturally towards surrealism. However, the actual motive of Clerici remained metaphysical.|$|E

The studio began courting other writers in May 2007, but were unimpressed with other pitches and eventually convinced Orci and Kurtzman to return. The studio also hired Ehren Kruger, who had impressed Bay and Hasbro president Brian Goldner with {{his knowledge of the}} Transformers mythology. The writing trio were paid $8 million. Screenwriting was interrupted by the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike, but to avoid production delays, the writers spent two weeks writing a treatment, which they handed in the night before the strike began. Bay then expanded the outline into a 60-page scriptment, which included more action, humor, and characters. The three writers spent four months finishing the screenplay while [...] "locked" [...] in two hotel rooms by Bay; Kruger wrote in his own room and the trio would check on <b>each</b> <b>others</b> <b>work</b> twice a day.|$|E
5000|$|Besides acting {{the most}} {{formative}} influence in Drake's childhood was the Anglican religion [...] - [...] later seceded from [...] - [...] and the outstanding {{memory of her}} Christmases was the sung Saint Cecilia Mass of Gounod, at the Midnight Mass in the Anglo-Catholic church of All Saints, Margaret Street. One of the preachers at this church, Geoffrey Heald, produced each year the All Saints choirboys in scenes by Shakespeare, in the clergy house. When one year the chorister set to play Sir Toby Belch in the kitchen scene from Twelfth Night fell ill, Drake {{was called in to}} replace him, and so she met a junior chorister also in the production - Laurence Olivier. [...] "His subsequent intimate friendship became one of my most treasured possessions; we would watch <b>each</b> <b>others</b> <b>work,</b> stay in each others houses, be available during public and private moments of triumph and disaster" [...] she wrote, though she never played with him again. At the age of sixteen she was sent to a finishing school in France, Camposenea at Meudon-val-Fleury. It had been a hunting lodge of Louis XIV and the sunken marble bath of Madame de Maintenon was still in place. She was taken to Reims, in ruins after the First World War, to Versailles, Chartres, the Forest of Fontainebleau, and she was taught, amongst others, by Georges Le Roy sociétaire of the Comédie-Française who was {{to become one of the}} great teachers of the Paris Conservatoire.|$|E
5000|$|... "Certainly, {{the fact}} that the game was going to be set ten years after the first BioShock {{established}} the atmosphere of BioShock 2," [...] he recalled. [...] "I really wanted the ambience to sell {{the fact that}} Rapture was constantly falling apart around the player." [...] In addition to lots of creaking and groaning sounds to accentuate the settings disrepair, Kamper and the audio team added non-diegetic sounds that grow in frequency the closer the player gets {{to the end of the}} game to convey the mounting insanity of the Splicers. The Big Sisters sound effects were created by layering sounds from birds, hyenas, and Kampers wife doing impressions of a dolphin. The audio team spent a great deal of time on immersing the player in their role of a Big Daddy through the audio—everything from the sound of the footsteps to the sounds for impacts and water drips on the players armor was used to sell the player on who their character was. Audio programmer Guy Somberg created a background sound system that allowed the team to layer stereo sounds together depending on the players location, combined with mono sound effects for certain areas. [...] "This allowed us to quickly iterate on our ambiences and implement them into the levels with ease, and helped create the randomness I was looking for in the background effects," [...] Kamper recalled. Multiplayer sounds were handled by Digital Extremes, who along with Kampers team had to make sure their sounds cohered not only with <b>each</b> <b>others</b> <b>work,</b> but with the sounds of the first game.|$|E

40|$|Relationships between {{classical}} music composers are known due to explicit historic material, for instance the friendship between Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, {{as well as}} the influence of the latter on Ludwig van Beethoven. While Haydn and Mozart were critics of <b>each</b> <b>others</b> <b>work,</b> Mozart and Beethoven probably never met in person. In spite of that there is an impact on especially the early music of Beethoven. While relationships between well-known composers like the mentioned ones are investigated, it can also be of historic interest to know the roles less-known composers played. Some of them might have a part in a famous persons work but were not further analyzed given the fact that there have been many composers and no hints given to researchers indicating which person would be worth studying. In this work we develop an approach to visually hint possible relationships among a large number of composers. Detailed historic knowledge is not taken into account; the hints are only based on the composer works {{as well as the}}ir lifetimes in order to guess directions of influence...|$|E
40|$|In our {{research}} {{we have developed}} {{a model for the}} design and development of a student-centred virtual learning environment that provides a sense of place. Architectural design becomes an important consideration when virtual learning environments are considered places (Clark and Maher, 2001). Traditional virtual learning environments are made up of two key elements: computing technology and education. In our model we introduce a third element: design theory, and therefore the concept of Learning by Designing. Designing and playing have much in common. Both activities require creativity, imagination, and reflection, and are situated and contextual in time and space. In this paper we explore the qualities of play and how providing a sense of place may support a playful experience. We implemented a virtual learning environment, based on the model, into a web site design course in the Faculty of Architecture, University of Sydney. Students design a web site and provide practical representations of their design in a student gallery. The student gallery allows students to view and discuss <b>each</b> <b>others</b> <b>work</b> in a supportive peer environment.

The method consists of developing {{versions of a}} concept for a building and the evaluation of them with criteria.

The main conclusions of the research are: 1. It appeared to be possible to develop a working software application prototype in Virtools with which a multidisciplinary design team can collaborate in a virtual 3 D environment in real-time on the Internet. 2.
