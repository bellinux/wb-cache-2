40|$|<b>In</b> {{international}} <b>cooperation,</b> bargaining {{failure occurs}} if the parties cannot achieve a mutually acceptable compromise. I study international <b>cooperation</b> problems <b>in</b> which compromise itself is inefficient, and thus {{equivalent to a}} bargaining failure. In international standard setting, for example, incompatibility of existing domestic standards often prevents efficient compromise. When is compromise inefficient, and how are states to avoid bargaining failure in such circumstances? I argue that inefficient compromise results from increasing returns, which prove prevalent <b>in</b> international <b>cooperation,</b> {{and focus on the}} problem of institutional design in bilateral and multilateral <b>cooperation.</b> <b>In</b> bilateral <b>cooperation,</b> I find that i) international arbitration is an optimal institutional design to avoid inefficient compromise and ii) states can prevent inefficient compromise in the future by coordinating the development of their nascent domestic institutions. <b>In</b> multilateral <b>cooperation,</b> I find that iii) issue linkage and delegation of decision-making power to an international committee can cause inefficient compromise and iv) states must sometimes design weak international agreements to avoid inefficient compromise...|$|R
