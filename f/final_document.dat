5|$|Morehead {{moved to}} Louisville in 1859 {{and formed a}} law {{partnership}} with his nephew, Charles M. Briggs. In February 1861, he attended the Peace Conference of 1861 that tried to resolve the sectional differences between the states. In May 1861, he was chosen as a delegate to the Border State Convention, an ultimately futile attempt to avert the Civil War. Morehead refused to sign the <b>final</b> <b>document</b> produced by the convention {{because he did not}} agree with all the statements it contained. He was an advocate of Kentucky's position of neutrality, but was personally sympathetic to the South and was an outspoken critic of the Lincoln administration. He condemned Secretary of State William H. Seward for cutting off trade with the South.|$|E

5|$|Gouverneur Morris is credited, {{both now}} and then, {{as the chief}} {{draftsman}} of the <b>final</b> <b>document,</b> including the stirring preamble. Not all the delegates were pleased with the results; thirteen left before the ceremony, and three of those remaining refused to sign: Edmund Randolph of Virginia, George Mason of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts. George Mason demanded a Bill of Rights if he was to support the Constitution. The Bill of Rights {{was not included in}} the Constitution submitted to the states for ratification, but many states ratified the Constitution with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow. Shortly before the document was to be signed, Gorham proposed to lower the size of congressional districts from 40,000 to 30,000 citizens. A similar measure had been proposed earlier, and failed by one vote. George Washington spoke up here, making his only substantive contribution to the text of the Constitution in supporting this move. The Convention adopted it without further debate. Gorham would sign the document, although he had openly doubted whether the United States would remain a single, unified nation for more than 150 years. Ultimately, 39 of the original 55 delegates ended up signing, but it is likely that none were completely satisfied. Their views were summed up by Benjamin Franklin, who said, I confess that There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them.... I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may be able to make a better Constitution.... It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does; and I think it will astonish our enemies...|$|E
25|$|He was {{confirmed}} {{in the position}} of party secretary at the third, fourth, fifth and sixth congresses of Rifondazione. At the last, however, his <b>final</b> <b>document</b> received less support than usual, gaining only 52% of delegates' votes. This close result has led many political commentators to suggest that he may be replaced as secretary of Rifondazione Comunista by Nichi Vendola.|$|E
25|$|September 17, 1787 {{marked the}} signing of the <b>final</b> <b>document.</b> By its own Article Seven, the {{constitution}} drafted by the convention needed ratification by at least nine of the thirteen states, through special conventions held in each state. Anti-Federalist writers began to publish essays and letters arguing against ratification, and Alexander Hamilton recruited James Madison and John Jay to write a series of pro-ratification letters in response.|$|E

The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.|$|E
25|$|The Signing of the United States Constitution {{occurred}} on September 17, 1787 when 39 {{delegates to the}} Constitutional Convention endorsed the constitution created during the convention. In addition to signatures, this closing endorsement, the Constitution's eschatocol, included a brief declaration that the delegates' work has been successfully completed and that those whose signatures appear on it subscribe to the <b>final</b> <b>document.</b> Included are, a statement pronouncing the document's adoption by the states present, a formulaic dating of its adoption, and the signatures of those endorsing it. Additionally, the convention's secretary, William Jackson, signed the document to authenticate {{the validity of the}} delegate signatures. He also made a few secretarial notes.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} two years, work on a new {{constitution}} was done, with independent drafts prepared in 1990 and 1991. At the end of 1991, the Supreme Council established a commission tasked to prepare a draft constitution. The resulting proposal {{was approved by the}} Supreme Council on April 21, 1992, and presented to the public. An alternative draft constitution was prepared by a coalition led by Sąjūdis. The main difference between the two proposals was the balance between the various branches of government. The proposal approved by the Supreme Council envisioned a parliamentary system, while the alternative proposal suggested a presidential model. The <b>final</b> <b>document</b> represented a compromise between a purely parliamentary system and a presidential one.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the {{previous}} article Hogg wrote, this book covered periods of Shelley's life that Hogg had only learned about secondhand. The Shelley family helped him by providing Percy Shelley's papers {{to him for}} use in his research. Percy Shelley's sisters Helen and Margaret also contributed accounts of childhood memories involving their brother. Hogg was known for the strength and clarity of his memory, {{and was able to}} recall minor details from the time that he spent with Percy Shelley. The initial plan was to release a four-volume work and the first two volumes of the book were published in 1858 by Edward Moxon. The text of Shelley at Oxford was included in the work, and comprised roughly one sixth of the <b>final</b> <b>document.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Paris Favre {{requested}} {{an officer}} {{to help him}} negotiate the technical articles of the formal armistice. He and General Charles de Beaufort d'Hautpoul returned to Versailles on 27 January, but, according to German accounts, the latter got drunk at the dinner celebration and Favre {{had to get a}} postponement of the final negotiations to the next day (28 January). On this second try a more competent officer, Charles Horix de Valdan, chief of staff to the commander of Paris, Joseph Vinoy, was sent along. Lacking sources of information on the disposition of his own troops at the time, Valdan relied on that supplied by von Moltke in demarcating the lines of control of the two sides. Both sides were to withdraw ten miles from the lines of control and the area between the German siege works and the disarmed Parisian forts was to be neutral. When Valdan had completed the technical military matters, Favre and Bismarck signed the <b>final</b> <b>document</b> on 28 January 1871. It immediately came into effect in Paris, and on 31 January in the other pertinent areas.|$|E
25|$|On August 17, 1857, the Oregon Constitutional Convention {{convened in}} Salem {{with the task}} of {{creating}} a constitution in order for Oregon to become a state. The Convention accomplished this task and submitted the <b>final</b> <b>document</b> to the voters of the territory for approval on November 9, 1857, when it was approved and then sent to the United States Senate for approval. Once approved by the Federal government, Oregon would become a state. However, communications between the East Coast and West Coast were still slow, and those elected as state officials had to wait for word of Oregon’s admission to the Union before they could formally begin their service. The state legislators meet twice before admission, from July 6 to July 9, and September 13 & 14. They met and adjourned once there was no word on Oregon’s statehood. The Territorial Legislature then met starting on December 6, 1858 for their final session. Previously in Oregon's government, the authority to dissolve a marriage was vested in the legislature, and during this final session the legislators granted 31 divorces before the authority shifted to the courts upon statehood. This session lasted until January 22, 1859, during which Charles Drain served as Council President and N. H. Gates was Speaker of the House.|$|E

500|$|The {{preparation}} of the first Virginia Constitution began in early 1776, {{in the midst of}} the early events of the American Revolution. Among those who drafted the 1776 Constitution were George Mason and James Madison. Thomas Jefferson was Virginia's representative to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia at the time, and his drafts of the Virginia constitution arrived too late to be incorporated into the <b>final</b> <b>document.</b> [...] James Madison's work on the Virginia Constitution helped him develop the ideas and skills that he would later use as one of the main architects of the United States Constitution.|$|E

Another usage was at the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009, a spokesman from Tuvalu criticised the <b>final</b> <b>document</b> by saying, [...] "It looks like we are being offered 30 pieces of silver to betray our people and our future...

500|$|On August 31, 1787, Massachusetts' Elbridge Gerry spoke {{against the}} {{document}} as a whole, as did Luther Martin of Maryland.

Still, Mason did not rule out signing it, saying that he wanted to see how certain matters still before the convention were settled before deciding a final position, whether to sign or ask for a second convention. As the final touches were made to the constitution, Mason and Gerry held meetings in the evening to discuss strategy, bringing in delegates representing states from Connecticut to Georgia.|$|E

500|$|Any {{motion that}} {{had the support of}} the Senate but was vetoed was {{recorded}} in the annals as a senatus auctoritas, while any motion that was passed and not vetoed was recorded as a senatus consultum. After the vote, each senatus consultum and each senatus auctoritas was transcribed into a <b>final</b> <b>document</b> by the presiding magistrate. This document included the name of the presiding magistrate, the place of the assembly, the dates involved, the number of senators who were present at time the motion was passed, the names of witnesses to the drafting of the motion, and the substance of the act. In addition, if the motion was a senatus consultum, a capital letter [...] "C" [...] was stamped on the document, to verify that the motion had been approved by the Senate.|$|E
500|$|In January 1543, Bucer {{began work}} on a major {{document}} for von Wied, [...] Melanchthon joined him in Bonn in May, and Caspar Hedio a month later, to help draft the document. At the beginning of July, Bucer discussed the draft with the archbishop, who, after studying it, submitted the document to the territorial diet on 23 July. Although the cathedral chapter flatly rejected it, the diet ruled in favour of the reform programme. The <b>final</b> <b>document</b> was over three hundred pages and covered a number of subjects on doctrine, church law, and liturgy. Some of the principles proposed include justification by faith, the acceptance of baptism and the Lord's Supper as the only valid sacraments, the offering of the cup to the laity, the holding of worship services in the vernacular, and the authorisation of priests to marry.|$|E
500|$|Beadle {{agreed with}} Smith that a deal ending UDI without any prior {{agreement}} on the replacement constitution would meet with widespread opposition among white Rhodesians, but still felt that Salisbury should agree.

Smith refused to make such a commitment, much to the disappointment of Beadle and Gibbs, and signed the <b>final</b> <b>document</b> only to acknowledge it as an accurate record. Wilson was furious with Beadle, feeling that he should have taken a far firmer line to persuade Smith to settle; after Beadle left the meeting, Wilson said that he [...] "could not understand how any man could have a slipped disc whom Providence had failed to provide with a backbone". Beadle and Gibbs urged Smith to reconsider during the journey home, but made little headway.|$|E
