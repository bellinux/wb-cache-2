50|$|Instead of the {{labour-intensive}} {{manual processing}} machines could be used. There {{has been much}} effort {{for a long time}} to obtain efficient machines. The same threshing-machine used for rice could be adapted with some technical modification for fonio. Because of the high cost and performance of such machines they have to be operated by multiple villages to be economically efficient. To clean the threshed seeds winnowing machines or rotational sieves could be used. The CIRAD developed a <b>decortication</b> <b>machine</b> of the GMBF type especially for fonio.|$|E
