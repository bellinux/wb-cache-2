500|$|Veteran UPI {{reporter}} <b>Helen</b> <b>Thomas</b> {{suggested that}} in public, the Nixons [...] "moved through life ritualistically", but privately, however, they were [...] "very close". In private, Richard Nixon {{was described as}} being [...] "unabashedly sentimental", often praising Pat for her work, remembering anniversaries and surprising her with frequent gifts. During state dinners, he ordered the protocol changed so that Pat could be served first. Pat, in turn, felt {{that her husband was}} vulnerable and sought to protect him. Of his critics, she said that [...] "Lincoln had worse critics. He was big enough not to let it bother him. That's the way my husband is." ...|$|E

500|$|Pat Nixon {{was listed}} on the Gallup Organization's top-ten list of the most admired women {{fourteen}} times, from 1959 to 1962 and 1968 to 1979. She was third in 1969, and remained at number two until 1972, when she was ranked number one as the most admired woman. She remained on the top-ten list until 1979, five years after her husband left office. To many, she {{was seen as an}} example of the [...] "American Dream," [...] having risen from a poor background, with her greatest popularity among the [...] "great silent majority" [...] of voters. Mary Brooks, the director of the United States Mint and a long-time friend of Pat's, illustrated some of the cultural divides present at the time when she described the First Lady as [...] "a good example to the women of this countryif they're not part of those Women's Liberation groups." [...] Additionally, it was the view of veteran UPI correspondent <b>Helen</b> <b>Thomas</b> that Pat [...] "was the warmest First Lady I covered and the one who loved people the most. I think newspeople who covered her saw a woman who was sharp, responsive, sensitive." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} his monologue, Colbert {{introduced}} what he {{characterized as}} an [...] "audition" [...] video to become the new White House Press Secretary—Scott McClellan had recently left the position. The video spliced clips of difficult questions from the White House press corps with responses from Colbert as Press Secretary. Colbert's podium included controls marked [...] "eject", [...] "Gannon" [...] (a reference to erstwhile White House reporter Jeff Gannon, who was suspected of asking planted questions), and [...] "volume", which he used to silence a critical question from journalist David Gregory. The video continued with Colbert fleeing the briefing room and the White House, only to be pursued by White House correspondent <b>Helen</b> <b>Thomas,</b> who had been a vocal critic of the Bush administration. At one point, Colbert picks up an emergency phone and explains that Thomas [...] "won't stop asking why we invaded Iraq". The dispatcher responds with, [...] "Hey, why did we invade Iraq?" [...] The entire second half of the video is a spoof of horror film clichés, particularly the film Westworld, with melodramatic music accompanying Thomas's slow, unwavering pursuit of Colbert, and Colbert loudly screaming [...] "No!" [...] at intervals. Widely available online, a portion of the mock audition tape aired on The Colbert Report on May 2, 2006.|$|E
