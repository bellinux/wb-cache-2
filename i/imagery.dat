Motor <b>imageries</b> are a major way to deliver commands in BCI. Nevertheless only a few systems use more than three motor imageries: right hand, left hand and feet.

We present an electrophysiological study to show that i) simple motor <b>imageries</b> have mainly an electrical modulation over the cortical area related the body part involved in the imagined movement and that ii) combined motor <b>imageries</b> reflect a superposition of the electrical activity of simple motor <b>imageries.</b> A shrinkage linear discriminant analysis {{has been used to}} test as a first step how a resting state and seven motor <b>imageries</b> can be detected. 11 healthy subjects participated in the experiment for which an intuitive assignment has been done to associate motor <b>imageries</b> and movements of the robotic arm with 7 degrees of freedom...|$|R

40|$|According to self-calibration bundle block adjustment, a {{mathematical}} model which solutes exterior orientation elements of the new <b>imageries</b> by using fixed <b>imageries</b> {{in the same area}} is set up at first. The orientation parameters of the fixed <b>imageries</b> are previously obtained. Several sets of aerial <b>imageries</b> at different scales are simulated based on a piece of DOM (Digital Orthophoto Map) with a scale of 1 : 50, 000 and corresponding DEM (Digital Elevation Model) with the interval of grid being 100 meters of some certain area. Finally, the exterior orientation elements of these new <b>imageries</b> and 3 D coordinates of photogrammetric points are calculated by combined bundle block adjustment with the derived mathematical model. The empirical results show that the exterior orientation elements and the coordinates of the photogrammetric points are identical between the mentioned method and the conventional bundle block adjustment for the two periods of <b>imageries</b> at the same scale. However, when the image scales are different the adjusted accuracy has an apparent decrease but can still meet the specification of topographic maps. The experiment has verified that the determination of the orientation parameters of the new <b>imageries</b> by using the fixed <b>imageries</b> is correct in theory and is feasible in practice. And the accuracy of 3 D coordinates of the photogrammetric points, which are purely gained by combined adjustment with two periods of <b>imageries,</b> satisfies the requirement of the specification of topographic maps. That is to say, aerial triangulation without ground control points (GCPs) can be truly realized. It will have glory application future on the map revision, the update of geographic spatial information database and automatic change detection of multi-temporal <b>imageries.</b> 1...|$|R

5|$|<b>Imagery</b> {{has always}} been an {{important}} part of the Orb's persona. This is most prominent during live performances, where they often project surreal images against onstage screens. Common images include morphing faces, futuristic cityscapes, and aliens. They have long associated their act with absurd symbology with images such as floating pigs. This has carried over to their music videos, most of which are spacy, brightly coloured montages of surreal images including astronauts, clouds, and neon dolphins. Because of their use of psychedelic images at shows, the Orb's shows are frequently compared to those of Pink Floyd, who also used in-show <b>imagery</b> and films.

In particular, it will first of all describe an existing ontology of <b>imageries</b> found in poems written during the Tang and the Song dynasties (7 th – 14 th century AD). It will then propose the augmentation of such <b>imageries</b> into primary, complex, extended and textual <b>imageries.</b> A rationale of such a structured approach is that while poets may use a common dichotomy of primary <b>imageries,</b> creative language use is to be found in the creation of complex and compound <b>imageries.</b> This approach will not only support analysis of inter-poets stylistic similarities and differences but will also effectively reveal intra-poet stylistic characteristics. This article will then describe a syntactic parser designed to produce parse trees that will eventually enable the automatic identification of possible <b>imageries</b> and their subsequent structural analysis and classification. Finally, a case study will be presented that investigated the syntactic properties found in two lyrics written by two stylistically different lyric writers in the Song Dynasty...|$|R

40|$|Since {{satellite}} and aerial <b>imageries</b> are recently widely spread and frequently observed, combination {{of them are}} expected to complement spatial and temporal resolution each other.

Another result might imply that mixing higher and lower resolution images for training dataset could help detection performance.

5|$|Ragnall is {{the only}} member of the meic Somairle known to have styled himself in {{documents}} rex insularum. His use of both the title and seal are probably derived from those of the leading members of the Crovan dynasty, such as his namesake Rǫgnvaldr, who not only bore the same title but was said to have borne a similar two-sided seal. The descriptions of the cousins' seals shows that these devices combined the <b>imagery</b> of a Norse-Gaelic galley and an Anglo-French knight. The maritime <b>imagery</b> probably symbolised the power of a ruler of an island-kingdom, and the equestrian <b>imagery</b> appears to have symbolised feudal society, in which the cult of knighthood had reached its peak in the twelfth- and early thirteenth centuries. The use of such seals by leading Norse-Gaelic lords, seated on the periphery of the kingdoms of Scotland and England, probably illustrates their desire to present themselves as up-to-date and modern to their contemporaries in Anglo-French society.|$|E
5|$|Stelae were {{essentially}} stone banners raised to glorify {{the king and}} record his deeds, although the earliest examples depict mythological scenes. <b>Imagery</b> developed throughout the Classic Period, with Early Classic stelae (c. 250–600) displaying non-Maya characteristics from the 4th century onwards, {{with the introduction of}} <b>imagery</b> linked to the central Mexican metropolis of Teotihuacan. This influence receded in the 5th century although some minor Teotihuacan references continued to be used.

In the Late Classic (c. 600–900), <b>imagery</b> linked to the Mesoamerican ballgame was introduced, once again displaying influence from central Mexico. By the Terminal Classic, the institution of divine kingship declined, and Maya kings began to be depicted with their subordinate lords.
