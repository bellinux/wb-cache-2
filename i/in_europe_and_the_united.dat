The division was reactivated in October 1999 as a formation for training and deploying U.S. Army National Guard units before its deactivation in October 2006.|$|E

5|$|Green {{today is}} not {{commonly}} associated <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States with love and sexuality, but in stories of the medieval period it sometimes represented love and the base, natural desires of man.

However, for the troubadours, green was the color of growing love, and light green clothing was reserved for young women who were not yet married.|$|E
5|$|The {{distribution}} of subtypes varies between countries. <b>In</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, 60–80% {{of people with}} Guillain–Barré syndrome have the demyelinating subtype (AIDP), and AMAN affects {{only a small number}} (6–7%). In Asia and Central and South America, that proportion is significantly higher (30–65%). This {{may be related to the}} exposure to different kinds of infection, but also the genetic characteristics of that population. Miller Fisher variant is thought to be more common in Southeast Asia.|$|E

Andranik is greatly admired as a national hero by Armenians; numerous statues of him have been erected in several countries. Streets and squares were named after Andranik, and songs, poems and novels {{have been written about}} him, making him a legendary figure in Armenian culture.|$|E

Australia's Mitchell Gourley and Cameron Rahles-Rahbula won gold medals.|$|E
5|$|Busoni {{was born}} in Empoli, just south of Florence; {{he was the son}} of {{professional}} musicians. Initially trained by his father, he later studied at the Vienna Conservatory and then with Wilhelm Mayer and Carl Reinecke. In the ensuing years, after brief periods teaching in Helsinki, Boston, and Moscow, he devoted himself to composing, teaching, and touring as a virtuoso pianist <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. His writings on music were influential; they covered not only aesthetics but considerations of microtones and other innovative topics. He was based in Berlin from 1894 but spent much of World War I in Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|Dementia, and {{specifically}} Alzheimer's disease, may {{be among the}} most costly diseases for society <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, while their costs in other countries such as Argentina, and South Korea, are also high and rising. These costs will probably increase with the ageing of society, becoming an important social problem. AD-associated costs include direct medical costs such as nursing home care, direct nonmedical costs such as in-home day care, and indirect costs such as lost productivity of both patient and caregiver. Numbers vary between studies but dementia costs worldwide have been calculated around $160billion, while costs of Alzheimer's disease in the United States may be $100billion each year.|$|E

Celebrating the North American launch, Smith, Colantonio, and other Arkane Studios staff members from the company's office in Austin, Texas, signed copies of the game at a local GameStop store. A Game of the Year edition, containing all released downloadable content (DLC), {{was released}} in October 2013. The Definitive Edition, a remastered version of the game featuring improved graphics, and all released DLC {{was released on}} the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in August 2015.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, Tesla {{developed}} an induction motor that ran on alternating current, a power system format that was rapidly expanding <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States {{because of its}} advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.|$|E

5|$|Known {{since the}} Middle Ages {{by the name}} plumb dulcis, the {{production}} of lead(II) nitrate from either metallic lead or lead oxide in nitric acid was small-scale, for direct use in making other lead compounds. In the 19th century lead(II) nitrate began to be produced commercially <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. Historically, the main use was as a raw material {{in the production of}} pigments for lead paints, but such paints have been superseded by less toxic paints based on titanium dioxide. Other industrial uses included heat stabilization in nylon and polyesters, and in coatings of photothermographic paper. Since around the year 2000, lead(II) nitrate has begun to be used in gold cyanidation.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo {{targeted}} a wider demographic profile {{with the}} first Nintendo DS (2004) than it had with the Game Boy line. Comparing 2008 life-to-date DS and DS Lite sales to the best-selling game console, Sony's PlayStation 2, showed potential in further expanding the Nintendo DS gaming population—particularly <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. To further promote the product line while expanding its gaming population, Nintendo created the DSi. Iwata has said that families often share DS and DS Lite consoles, so to encourage each family member to buy an individual handheld, Nintendo added personalization features to the DSi.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis {{has existed}} for {{thousands}} of years, with depictions of the disease in ancient art. The disease was first recognized as a distinct condition by Michael Underwood in 1789 and {{the virus that causes}} it was first identified in 1908 by Karl Landsteiner. Major outbreaks started to occur in the late 19th century <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. In the 20th century it {{became one of the most}} worrying childhood diseases in these areas. The first polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s by Jonas Salk. It is hoped that vaccination efforts and early detection of cases will result in global eradication of the disease by 2018.|$|E

5|$|The recent {{advent of}} {{artificial}} tissue culture, or more specifically in vitro, technology <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States {{has meant that}} plants can be produced in large numbers and sold at relatively low prices (~US$20–$30 {{in the case of}} N. rajah). In vitro propagation refers to production of whole plants from cell cultures derived from explants (generally seeds). This technology has, to a large extent, removed the incentive for collectors to travel to Sabah to collect the plant illegally, and demand for wild-collected plants has fallen considerably in recent years.|$|E
5|$|Emily Sartain (March 17, 1841 – June 17, 1927) was an American {{painter and}} engraver. She {{was the first}} woman <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States to {{practice}} the art of mezzotint engraving, and the only woman to win a gold medal at the 1876 World Fair in Philadelphia. Sartain became a nationally recognized art educator and was the director of the Philadelphia School of Design for Women from 1866 to 1920. Her father, John Sartain, and three of her brothers, William, Henry and Samuel were artists. Before she entered the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and studied abroad, her father took her on a Grand Tour of Europe. She helped found the New Century Club for working and professional women, and the professional women's art clubs, The Plastic Club and The Three Arts Club.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari {{undertook}} additional medical study <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, learning pioneering {{techniques that}} she {{brought back to}} Argentina. She studied urinary tract monitoring at the Medical Faculty of Paris, earning the first diploma ever given to a woman. She designed a vaginoscope, studied radiation therapy at the Curie Institute, and performed a Caesarean section at Columbia University. She was responsible for bringing these innovations back with her to Argentina and implementing them at the maternity and gynecological unit she established at the Military Hospital. An ardent feminist, she established the Argentina Federation of University Women in 1936, and pushed for recognition of both {{civil and political rights}} for women. When the government of Argentina took a conservative turn in the late 1930s, she was pushed out of the hospital and later, in the early 1950s, out of teaching. She died in 1956.|$|E
