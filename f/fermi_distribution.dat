40|$|The neutron skin {{thickness}} of nuclei is a sensitive probe {{of the nuclear}} symmetry energy and has multiple implications for nuclear and astrophysical studies. However, precision measurements of this observable are difficult to obtain. The analysis of the experimental data may imply some assumptions about the bulk or surface nature {{of the formation of}} the neutron skin. Here we study the bulk or surface character of neutron skins of nuclei following from calculations with Gogny, Skyrme, and covariant nuclear mean-field interactions. These interactions are successful in describing nuclear charge radii and binding energies but predict different values for neutron skins. We perform the study by fitting two-parameter <b>Fermi</b> <b>distributions</b> to the calculated self-consistent neutron and proton densities.

40|$|Understanding how the {{mechanism}} of charge transport through molecular tunnel junctions depends on temperature is crucial to control electronic function in molecular electronic devices. With just a few systems investigated {{as a function of}} bias and temperature so far, thermal effects in molecular tunnel junctions remain poorly understood. Here we report a detailed charge transport study of an individual redox-active ferrocene-based molecule over a wide range of temperatures and applied potentials. The results show the temperature dependence of the current to vary strongly {{as a function of the}} gate voltage. Specifically, the current across the molecule exponentially increases in the Coulomb blockade regime and decreases at the charge degeneracy points, while remaining temperature-independent at resonance.

40|$|A {{loop diagram}} {{approach}} to the nonlinear optical conductivity of an electron-phonon system is introduced.

Therefore it is possible, in an organized manner, to present the phonon emissions and absorptions as well as photon absorptions in all electron transition processes.

40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} {{formalism}} to describe collisional correlations responsible for thermalization effects in finite quantum systems. The approach consists in a stochastic {{extension of time}} dependent mean field theory. Correlations are treated in time dependent perturbation theory and loss of coherence is assumed at some time intervals allowing a stochastic reduction of the correlated dynamics {{in terms of a}} stochastic ensemble of time dependent mean-fields. This theory was formulated long ago in terms of density matrices but never applied in practical cases because of its complexity. We propose here a reformulation of the theory in terms of wave functions and use a simplified 1 D model of cluster and molecules allowing to test the theory in a schematic but realistic manner. We illustrate the performance in terms of several observables, in particular global moments of the density matrix and single particle entropy built on occupation numbers. The occupation numbers remain fixed in time dependent mean-field propagation and change when evaluating the correlations, then taking fractional values.

40|$|The {{statistical}} mechanical partition function {{can be used}} {{to construct}} different forms of phase space distributions not restricted to the Gibbs-Boltzmann factor. With a generalised Lorentzian both the Kappa-Bose and Kappa-Fermi partition functions are obtained in straightforward way, from which the conventional Bose and <b>Fermi</b> <b>distributions</b> follow for κ→∞. For κ≠∞ these are subject to the restrictions that they can be used only at temperatures far from zero. They thus, as shown earlier, have little value for quantum physics.

In the classical large temperature limit one obtains physically reasonable κ-distributions which depend on energy respectively momentum as well as on chemical potential. Looking for other functional dependencies, we examine Bessel functions whether they can be used for obtaining valid distributions.
