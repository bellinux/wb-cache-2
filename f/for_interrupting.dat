Hussein, who looked bald and weakened, arrived and urged both Arafat and Netanyahu to overcome the obstacles. Encouraged by his presence, the two leaders agreed to resolve their difficulties.

25|$|On January 18 {{the dispute}} was {{resolved}} when Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Yulia Tymoshenko negotiated {{a new contract}} that covered {{the next ten years}} (on October 11, 2011, a Ukrainian court sentenced Tymoshenko to seven years in prison for abuse of office because she signed this deal). Gas flows to Europe restarted on the morning of January 20, and were fully restored within two days. In the aftermath, Gazprom was estimated to have lost US$1.5billion in revenues due to lack of sales, and Ukraine was speculated to have incurred major economic losses. Analysts point out that the crisis had a negative and possibly irreversible impact on the reputations of both Russia as an energy supplier, and Ukraine as a transit country. There is no consensus amongst analysts on who bore the most responsibility for the crisis. Due to the absence of international monitors {{on both sides of the}} Ukrainian pipeline system, it is impossible to determine with certainty who was responsible <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> gas flow to Europe.|$|E
500|$|Gloucestershire gave Hammond an {{extended}} {{run at the}} start of the 1922 season. He played five matches without passing 32 runs in an innings at a batting average of under ten. He did not have the opportunity to improve his record as Lord Harris, the Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C.) treasurer, noticed that Hammond was born in Kent. He had not resided in Gloucestershire long enough to be eligible to play for the team under County Championship rules, and was barred for the rest of the season. The press criticised the ruling <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> the career of a player seen as very promising, despite his lack of success thus far. Hammond spent the rest of the summer, which he later described as the most miserable of his life, watching county games, although [...] Gloucestershire continued to pay him in full.|$|E

The Boricua Popular Army and two other groups—the Volunteers of the Puerto Rican Revolution and Armed Forces of Popular Resistance—jointly took responsibility for the attacks. The EBP issues a joint release with the OVRP and FARP taking responsibility for the attack. The organizations cited {{that it was a}} retaliation for Cerro Maravilla and the recent death of Ángel Rodríguez Cristóbal, who died in a federal prison in Tallahassee, Florida after being arrested <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> military exercises in Vieques during May of that year. The mystery surrounding his death while in custody led the EPB to believe that he had been murdered in an attempt to intimidate the independence movement, leading to a declaration that [...] "blood would be paid with blood" [...] and that they would retaliate against the United States military if another independentist died in similar circumstances. The organization closed this communique by citing the Geneva convention and urging the United States to protect the safety of its prisoners.|$|E
500|$|In July 1909 Davison {{was arrested}} with fellow suffragettes Mary Leigh and Alice Paul <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> a public meeting from which women were barred, {{held by the}} Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George; she was sentenced to two months for obstruction.

She was arrested again in September the same year for throwing stones to break windows at a political meeting; the assembly, which was to protest at the 1909 budget, was only open to men. She was sent to Strangeways prison for two months. She again went on hunger strike and was released after two and a half days. She subsequently wrote to The Manchester Guardian to justify her action of throwing stones as one [...] "which was meant as a warning to the general public of the personal risk they run in future if they go to Cabinet Ministers' meetings anywhere".

[...] Maybe Ella Mae Morse, maybe Moon Mullican had done it, but not in a way that became the propelling force of the song. [...] Rock and roll piano up to that point had been defined by Rosco Gordon, Ike Turner, and to an extent, Ray Charles. [...] None of them were doing that.

40|$|Execution {{time control}} is a {{technique}} that allows execution time budgets to be set and overruns to be handled dynamically to prevent deadline misses. This removes {{the need for the}} worst-case execution time (WCET) of tasks to be found by offline timing analysis – a problem that can be very hard to solve for modern computer architectures. Execution time control can also increase the processor utilization, as the WCET will often be much higher than the average execution time. This thesis describes how the GNU Ada Compiler and a bare-board Ravenscar run-time environment were ported to the Atmel AVR 32 UC 3 microcontroller series making the Ada programming language available on this architecture for the first time, and an implementation of Ada execution time control for this system that supports full execution time control <b>for</b> <b>interrupt</b> handling. Usage patterns for this brand new feature are demonstrated in Ada by extending the object-oriented real-time framework with execution time servers <b>for</b> <b>interrupt</b> handling, allowing the system to be protected against unexpected bursts of interrupts that could otherwise result in deadline misses. Separate execution time measurement <b>for</b> <b>interrupt</b> handling also improves the accuracy of measurement for tasks. As {{a direct result of the}} work presented in this thesis separate execution time measurement <b>for</b> <b>interrupts</b> will be included in the forthcoming ISO-standard for Ada 2012. While the implementation of execution time control is for the Ada programming language and the UC 3 microcontroller series, the design and implementation should be portable to other architectures, and the principles of execution time control <b>for</b> <b>interrupt</b> handling applicable to other programming languages. Low run-time overhead is important for execution time control to be useful for real-time systems. Therefore a hardware Time Management Unit (TMU) was designed to reduce the overhead of execution time control. This design has been implemented for the UC 3 and performance tests with the developed run-time environment shows that it gives a significant reduction of overhead. The memory-mapped design of the TMU also allows it to be implemented on other architectures. PhD i teknisk kybernetikkPhD in Engineering Cybernetic...|$|R

40|$|High {{bandwidth}} {{of networks}} demands high performance communication processors that integrate application processing, network processing, and system support functions into a single, low cost System-On-Chip solution. However, conventional processors, {{when used in}} network related applications, are beset by the overhead of save/restore of register context, cache misses due to fetching interrupt handler from memory, {{and the possibility of}} NIC buffer overflow. Therefore, this paper analyzes the effectiveness of multithreading to service interrupts on an embedded processor simulator enhanced with a multithreaded hardware execution model. Our simulation results reveal that multithreading <b>for</b> <b>interrupts</b> from a single NIC brings only a modest improvement to processing performance. However, our analysis also shows that multithreading <b>for</b> <b>interrupts</b> has a lot of potential when applied to communication processors with multiple interrupt sources, such as Ethernet, ATM, USB, and HDLC...|$|R
