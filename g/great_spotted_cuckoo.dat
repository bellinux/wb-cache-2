5|$|This {{species is}} a {{secondary}} {{host of the}} parasitic <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> the European magpie being the preferred host. However, {{in areas where the}} latter species is absent, such as Israel and Egypt, the hooded crow becomes the normal corvid host.|$|E
5|$|Predators of the choughs {{include the}} {{peregrine}} falcon, golden eagle and Eurasian eagle-owl, while the common raven will take nestlings. In northern Spain, red-billed choughs preferentially nest near lesser kestrel colonies; the falcon, which eats only insects, provides {{a degree of}} protection against larger predators, and the chough benefits {{in terms of a}} higher breeding success. The red-billed chough is occasionally parasitised by the <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> a brood parasite for which the Eurasian magpie is the primary host.|$|E

40|$|Reproductive {{success of}} brood parasites largely depends on {{appropriate}} host selection and, although {{the use of}} inadvertent social information emitted by hosts may be of selective advantage for cuckoos, this possibility has rarely been experimentally tested. Here, we manipulated nest size and clutch colouration of magpies (Pica pica), the main host of <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cuckoos</b> (Clamator glandarius). These phenotypic traits may potentially reveal information about magpie territory and/or parental quality and could hence influence the cuckoo's choice of host nests. Experimentally reduced magpie nests suffered higher predation rate, and prevalence of cuckoo parasitism was higher in magpie nests with the densest roofs, which suggests a direct advantage for <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cuckoos</b> choosing this type of magpie nest. Colouration of magpie clutches was manipulated by adding one artificial egg (blue or cream colouration) {{at the beginning of}} the egg-laying period. We found that host nests holding an experimental cream egg experienced a higher prevalence of cuckoo parasitism than those holding a blue-coloured egg. Results from these two experiments suggest that <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cuckoos</b> cue on magpie nest characteristics and the appearance of eggs to decide parasitism, and confirm, for the first time, the ability of cuckoos to distinguish between eggs of different colours within the nest of their hosts. Several hypothetical scenarios explaining these results are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Clamator glandarius) {{has been}} {{recorded}} as a brood parasite of the western jackdaw, depositing its eggs in their nests in Spain and Israel. Nest robbers include the common raven in Spain, tawny owl, and least weasel (Mustela nivalis) in England, and brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) in Finland. The European pine marten (Martes martes) raids isolated nests in Sweden but is less successful when nests {{are part of a}} colony.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{the common}} cuckoo, neither the hen nor the hatched chick {{of this species}} evict the host's eggs, but the young magpies often die because they cannot compete {{successfully}} with the cuckoo for food. However {{it has been shown}} that this species' chicks secrete a repellent scent when predators threaten. The repellent protects <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cuckoo</b> chicks themselves as well as the host's chicks from predators. [...] Carrion crow (Corvus corone corone) chicks survive better if a <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cuckoo</b> chick shares their nest. Birds of prey and feral cats less frequently predate crow's nests that include a <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cuckoo</b> chick. Crow chicks benefit only when predators are very active; when there is less predation, losing food to <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cuckoo</b> chicks harms the crow chicks without compensation.|$|E

50|$|The {{woodland}} vegetation is good {{habitat for}} various animals, including wolves and jackals, foxes, porcupines, hyraxes, mongooses and the {{broad-toothed field mouse}} (Apodemus mysticanus). In a cave {{at the top of}} the Mount, long-fingered bats (Myotis capaccini), can be found roosting. Various reptiles can also be found including; the Greek tortoise (Testudo graeca), the hardun lizard (Stellagama stellio), the Lebanon lizard (Phoenicolacerta laevi) and the red whip snake (Platyceps collaris). The woodland is also a good habitat for various birds including jays (Garrulus), Syrian woodpeckers (Dendrocopos syriacus), Sardinian warblers (Sylvia melanocephala), Eurasian hobbies (Falco subbuteo), great tits (Parus major), <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cuckoos</b> (Clamator glandarius) and snake eagles (Circaetus).|$|R
40|$|The {{offspring}} {{of birds and}} mammals {{use a combination of}} movements and vocalizations, known as begging, to solicit food from their parents. A widespread interpretation of begging is that it constitutes an honest signal of offspring need. But we know that in the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) the intensity of begging calls reflects the past experience of offspring in addition to their need. Here we show that this result generalizes to other species. An experiment with hand-reared magpies (Pica pica) and <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cuckoos</b> (Clamator glandarius) indicates that the begging strategies depend on the past experience of chicks and the composition of their brood. In asynchronous two-magpie broods, both chicks begged at the same intensity when the large chick obtained food more easily than its sibling, but the large chick begged at higher intensity when it was easier for the smaller chick to obtain food. Cuckoo chicks begged at higher intensity than magpies. [KEYWORDS: begging, communication, handicap principle, hatching asynchrony, learning, signaling of need. ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} defensive host traits against brood parasitism is the detection and ejection of parasitic eggs from their nests. Here, we explore the possible role of olfaction in this defensive behaviour. We performed egg-recognition tests in magpie Pica pica nests with model eggs resembling those of parasitic <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cuckoos</b> Clamator glandarius. In one of the experiment, experimental model eggs were exposed to strong or moderate smell of tobacco smoke, whereas those of a third group (control) were cleaned with disinfecting wipes and kept in boxes containing odourless cotton. Results showed that model eggs with strong tobacco scent were more frequently ejected compared with control ones. In another experiment, models were smeared with scents from cloacal wash from magpies (control), cloacal wash or uropygial secretions from cuckoos, or human scents. This experiment resulted in a statistically significant effect of treatment in unparasitized magpie nests in which control model eggs handled by humans were more often rejected. These results provide the first evidence that hosts of brood parasites use their olfactory ability to detect and eject foreign eggs from their nests. These findings may have important consequences for handling procedures of experimental eggs used in egg-recognition tests, in addition to our understanding of interactions between brood parasites and their hosts...|$|R

40|$|Exploring factors guiding {{interactions}} of bacterial communities with animals has become of primary importance for ecologists and evolutionary biologists {{during the last}} years because of their likely {{central role in the}} evolution of animal life history traits. We explored the association between laying date and eggshell bacterial load (mesophilic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococci, and Enterococci) in natural and artificial magpie (Pica pica) nests containing fresh commercial quail (Coturnix coturnix) eggs. We manipulated hygiene conditions by spilling egg contents on magpie and artificial nests and explored experimental effects during the breeding season. Egg breakage is a common outcome of brood parasitism by <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cuckoos</b> (Clamator glandarius) on the nests of magpie, one of its main hosts. We found that the treatment increased eggshell bacterial load in artificial nests, butnot in magpie nests with incubating females, which suggests that parental activity prevents the proliferation of bacteria on the eggshells in relation to egg breakage. Moreover, laying date was positively related to eggshell bacterial load in active magpie nests, but negatively in artificial nests. The results suggest that variation in parental characteristics of magpies rather than climatic variation during the breeding season explained the detected positive association. Because the eggshell bacterial load is a proxy of hatching success, the detected positive association between eggshell bacterial loads and laying date in natural, but not in artificial nests, suggests that the generalized negative association between laying date and avian breeding success can be, at least partially, explained by differential bacterial effects.

50|$|There are two avian {{species that}} have been speculated to portray this mafia-like behavior: the brown-headed cowbird of North America, Molothrus ater, and the <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cuckoo</b> of Europe, Clamator glandarius. The <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cuckoo</b> lays the {{majority}} of its eggs in the nests of the European magpie, Pica pica. It has been observed that the <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cuckoo</b> repeatedly visits the nests that it has parasitised, a precondition for the mafia hypothesis. An experiment was run by Soler et al. from April to July 1990 - 1992 in the high-altitude plateau Hoya de Guadix, Spain. They observed the effects of the removal of cuckoo eggs on the reproductive success of the magpie and measured the magpie's reaction; the egg was considered accepted if it remained in the nest, ejected if gone in between visits, or abandoned if the eggs were present but cold. If any nest contents were gone between consecutive visits, the nests were considered to have been depredated. The magpie's reproductive success was measured by number of nestlings that survived to their last visit, which was just before the nestling had been predicted to fledge from the nest. The results from these experiments show that after the removal of the parasitic eggs from the <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> these nests are predated at much higher rates than those where the eggs were not removed. Through the use of plasticine eggs that model those of the magpie, it was confirmed that the nest destruction was caused by the <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cuckoo.</b> This destruction benefits the cuckoo, for the possibility of re-nesting by the magpie allows another chance for the cuckoo egg to be accepted.|$|E

5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> {{woodpecker}} {{is similar}} to some other species in its genus. The Syrian woodpecker lacks its relative's black cheek bar and has whiter underparts and paler red underparts, although juvenile <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> woodpeckers often have an incomplete cheek bar, so can potentially be misidentified as Syrian. The white-winged woodpecker has a far more extensive white wing patch than the <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> woodpecker.
