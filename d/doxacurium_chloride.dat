50|$|<b>Doxacurium</b> <b>chloride</b> (formerly {{recognized}} as BW938U80 or BW A938U) is a neuromuscular-blocking drug or skeletal muscle relaxant {{in the category}} of non-depolarizing neuromuscular-blocking drugs, used adjunctively in anesthesia to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. Unlike a number of other related skeletal muscle relaxants, it is rarely used adjunctively to facilitate endotracheal intubation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{heritage}} of mivacurium and indeed its very closely related cousin, <b>doxacurium</b> <b>chloride,</b> {{harks back to}} the synthesis of numerous compounds following structure-activity relationships that drove researchers to find the ideal replacement for succinylcholine (suxamethonium). Both mivacurium and doxacurium are descendants of early vigorous attempts to synthesize potent non-depolarizing agents with pharmacophores derived from cross-combinations of the non-depolarizing agent, laudexium, and the well-known depolarizing agent, succinylcholine (suxamethonium chloride). Ironically, laudexium itself was invented by a cross-combination between the prototypical non-depolarizing agent, d-tubocurarine and the depolarizing agent, decamethonium. From the 1950s through to the 1970s, the present-day concept of a neuromuscular blocking agent with a rapid onset and an ultra-short duration of action had not taken root: researchers and clinicians {{were still on the}} quest for potent but non-depolarizing replacements devoid of the histamine release and the dreaded [...] "recurarizing" [...] effects seen with tubocurarine and, more importantly, the absence of a depolarizing mechanism of action as seen with succinylcholine and decamethonium.|$|E
