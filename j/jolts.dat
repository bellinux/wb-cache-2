5|$|As Jerry is {{sleeping}} on the plane he dreams of returning to his apartment only to find several FBI agents there interrogating Kramer, who apparently has ratted out Jerry. When Jerry protests that {{he had nothing to}} do with it, they reveal that the Russian was an undercover FBI agent. Jerry tries to flee only to be gunned down by the agents. This <b>jolts</b> him awake. He finds his show is canceled due to bad weather, and George picks up Jerry at the airport. Jerry is initially amazed that George is perfectly willing, even anxious to drive Jerry home. When he informs George they cannot go back to his apartment because of the baby shower, George insists and Jerry discovers that George is wearing the red shirt and is just using the favor as a chance to encounter Leslie at the baby shower. Meanwhile, Kramer and the two Russians crash the shower to install cable television, start to eat all the food and get into a heated argument. When George and Jerry arrive, George's plan proves unsuccessful, as he cannot muster the courage confront Leslie and instead awkwardly tries to curry her favor. He is interrupted when one of the other party guests (Margaret Reed as Mary) suddenly confronts Jerry because he never called her back after a date. This unpleasant scene is the final straw and the guests leave hurriedly. On the way out of the bathroom the angry woman bumps Leslie and her dessert into George, adding a chocolate cake stain to the Bosco stain already on the shirt. Jerry changes his mind about the cable hook-up, but is still charged with a large amount of money. When he refuses to pay, the Russians break the picture tube of his television set.|$|E

25|$|Stage 7 {{was where}} the Enterprise-B's bridge, {{deflector}} room and corridors were built and filmed. The <b>jolts</b> and shocks of the ship in the hold of the energy ribbon were created by camera bumps and motors to shake the set. Filming of the scenes took place in April 1994, while residents were still skittish from the recent 1994 Northridge earthquake; the effects staff deliberately hid the set shakers until cameras were rolling to elecit more genuine reactions. The Amargosa observatory set was an elaborate redress of the Enterprise-B bridge, with an added back room, second level, and swapped walls changing the layout to appear a different setting.

25|$|The Australian juggernaut seemed unstoppable as {{they looked}} on course for their 17th {{consecutive}} victory in the second test at the Eden Gardens. Australia amassed 445 runs in the first innings after winning the toss and electing to bat first. In reply, Indian team was bowled out for meagre 171 conceding a lead of 274 runs. Dravid scored 25 runs from 82 balls and eventually got out bowled to Warne for the 2nd time in a row. Only Laxman scored more than Dravid in the innings. India was expectedly asked to follow-on by Steve Waugh. Laxman, who had scored a fine fifty in the first innings was promoted to no. 3 position which had been Dravid's usual spot for quite sometime now, while Dravid, who was not looking in best of form in the series, was relegated to no. 6 position. Although Indian batting displayed better show in the second innings, they were still looking towards a certain defeat. Dravid came out to bat at no. 6 with scoreboard reading 232/4 with India still needing 42 runs to avoid an innings defeat. Dravid joined forces {{with the man who}} had replaced him at no. 3 position as they played out the remaining time avoiding any further <b>jolts.</b> India ended the day's play at 254/4 with Laxman unbeaten at 109 and Dravid at 7.|$|E

500|$|Acid Tongue has {{received}} generally favorable reviews, scoring a 75% on review aggregator Metacritic. Creative Loafing {{said that while}} Rabbit Fur Coat [...] "glided through an Appalachian dream world", Lewis [...] "stomps her boots while exploring similar terrain" [...] on Acid Tongue. The review continued that while the album [...] "includes plenty of quirky meditations on lost love that recall her previous adventures, [...] well-placed <b>jolts</b> give Acid Tongue greater balance, a component that's lacking on Rabbit Fur Coat." [...] According to The Sunday Times, [...] "the results are magnificent, [...] but occasionally they are a shaky misstep." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Jim DeRogatis called Acid Tongue [...] "sensual and entrancing." [...] The Daily Trojan labeled the tracks as [...] "psychedelic, occasionally sexy, but always timeless", although noting that the album [...] "lacks a thematic focus {{that can be found}} on every other album Lewis has released".|$|E

500|$|Media {{response}} to A Weekend in the City was mixed, but generally positive; aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised rating of 65% based on 30critical reviews. Louis Pattison of NME described the album as [...] "tender and reflective, edgy and embittered; {{a difficult and}} emotional beast that <b>jolts</b> with nervous electricity" [...] and pointed out that its notable achievement is that it finds moments of genuine contentment amidst [...] "a maelstrom of anger and confusion". Allmusic's Heather Phares did not find the album as immediate as Bloc Party's earlier work, but noted that [...] "its gradual move from alienation to connection and hope is just as bold as Silent Alarm, and possibly even more resonant". Drowned in Sound's Mike Diver called it [...] "dirty, dishevelled, unsure and paranoid; fearful, easily distracted, boisterous and ashamed; reckless, wild, nervous and terrified; graceful, thought-provoking, clumsy and contradictory... and very nearly perfect." [...] Jeff Miller of the Chicago Tribune concluded, [...] "For Bloc Party, Silent Alarm was a baby step {{and this is a}} giant leap." ...|$|E

500|$|The strongest {{element of}} style noted by critics and reviewers is Lee's talent for narration, which {{in an early}} review in Time was called [...] "tactile brilliance". Writing a decade later, another scholar noted, [...] "Harper Lee has a {{remarkable}} gift of story-telling. Her art is visual, and with cinematographic fluidity and subtlety we see a scene melting into another scene without <b>jolts</b> of transition." [...] Lee combines the narrator's voice of a child observing her surroundings with a grown woman's reflecting on her childhood, using the ambiguity of this voice combined with the narrative technique of flashback to play intricately with perspectives. This narrative method allows Lee to tell a [...] "delightfully deceptive" [...] story that mixes the simplicity of childhood observation with adult situations complicated by hidden motivations and unquestioned tradition. However, at times the blending causes reviewers to question Scout's preternatural vocabulary and depth of understanding. Both Harding LeMay and the novelist and literary critic Granville Hicks expressed doubt that children as sheltered as Scout and Jem could understand the complexities and horrors involved in the trial for Tom Robinson's life.|$|E
500|$|Several {{other critics}} praised {{the way that}} the film had kept the tone of James's story and the subtle {{approach}} to horror. This subtlety, according to a review in the Western Morning News, hit [...] "exactly the right note of terror", and the film was praised as genuinely scary by some critics. Whittaker, though generally critical of the film, felt it strongest when focussed on the house, children and ghosts. Paul Whitelaw, writing in The Scotsman, commended Welch and Fywell for sustaining a horrific atmosphere, and noted that the soundtrack added to the horror. For him, even the use of horror clichés was effective, contributing to the film's atmosphere. The Guardians Phil Hogan expressed a contrary opinion: while he thought The Turn of the Screw [...] "exquisitely turned out", he felt the film's use of clichés limited {{the extent to which it}} was actually scary. In a review for The Leader-Post, Andy Cooper praised the [...] "creepy atmosphere" [...] and tension, but said that the film [...] " [...] short in the chills department" [...] and [...] "could have done with a few <b>jolts</b> of terror to breathe more life into it".|$|E
500|$|As {{the group}} {{attempts}} to enter Dr. Totenkopf's lair, one scientist is electrocuted {{by the defense}} system.

He had died 20 years prior, but his machines continued his plan. Joe decides to sabotage the rocket from the inside while the others escape. Polly tries to tag along, but Joe kisses her and then knocks her out. Polly recovers, following Joe and luckily saving him from Dr. Jennings' assassin, a female robot. Joe and Polly then board the rocket. Before the rocket reaches 100km, when its second stage is scheduled to fire and thereby incinerate the Earth, Polly pushes an emergency button that ejects all the animals in escape pods.
