As Psmith begins his reading of McTodd's poems, Cootes turns off the lights and Peavey grabs the necklace, flinging {{it out of the}} window to where Eve is standing; she hides it in a <b>flowerpot.</b> Returning later to fetch it, she wakes the vigilant Baxter, but evades him, leaving him locked out and stashing her <b>flowerpot</b> on a windowsill.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Flowerpots</b> are {{a type of}} sea stack, formed {{over many}} years as wind, rain, waves and ice {{hammered}} away at the cliff that once stood alongside the water’s edge.

25|$|He also {{insisted on}} always {{wearing the same}} {{battered}} old <b>flowerpot</b> sunhat during his time out in the field, a constant companion from his debut in 1981 to his last game in 2004. Russell lined up the ball with the specially cut back rim, but it ended up rather worn out. Only his wife Aileen was allowed to repair it, while Russell carried an emergency repair kit of cotton thread and rubber. Its state of age and hence apparent disrepair caused more than one argument with the authorities. Russell refused to wear the official coloured one-day sunhat in South Africa, with a compromise only reached when Russell agreed to wear his old <b>flowerpot</b> hat inside the new sun hat. On a second occasion in the West Indies, he agreed to wash it, and placed it to dry in an oven. Forgotten and resultantly overbaked, the hat caught fire, and was only just rescued from total incineration – the top collapsed like puff pastry on removal. The fire damage could still {{be seen on the}} hat years later.|$|E

Lord returned from a few days away with The <b>Flowerpot</b> Men to find the entire flat covered in aluminium foil. Everything; even the furniture and the light bulbs.|$|E

Next morning, Baxter is fired from his job, and Eve finds the <b>flowerpot</b> empty at Psmith's cottage. Enlisting Freddie's help, she {{searches}} the place, but finds nothing; Psmith enters and explains his motives, his friendship with Mike and Phyllis. Cootes and Peavey appear, armed, and threaten to escape with the necklace, but Psmith takes advantage of Freddie's leg falling through the ceiling to overpower Cootes and retrieve the jewels.|$|E

[...] The Times said, [...] "This is probably Mrs. David's most academic work yet.

500|$|The game's {{engine was}} Crystal Tools, a specially-created {{middleware}} engine {{that was also}} used in Final Fantasy XIII. So {{that it would be}} compatible with the game's specifications, the team customized the engine to suit their needs. In the end, the game's chosen engine proved unsuitable {{to the needs of the}} game, rendering its internal structure [...] "broken". The game's development ended up being beset with multiple problems. According to a later postmortem, the team developing the game had an unhealthy obsession of graphical quality over gameplay content that led to other parts of the game being neglected, reinforced by the company's then-outdated development methods. A cited example of the focus on graphics was a <b>flowerpot,</b> which had as many polygons and lines of shader code as a player character. This high graphical quality meant that compromises needed to be made; for example, the number of players present on-screen at any one time needed to be limited to twenty, undermining the large-scale communal appeal of MMORPGs. This issue also impacted the game's environments; to save on memory space while preserving seamless travel, the team needed to reuse environmental features and textures on a regular basis. Another problem was that the team lacked experience in developing MMORPGs, a problem that had also beset Final Fantasy XI, but had been successfully overcome. With this in mind, the team were still using the development mindset used during the sixth console generation, which could not hold up under the increased staff and resource needs for seventh generation development. A third major reason was the company's belief that the game's problems could be patched after the initial launch, compounded by the lack of an overall plan for how to deal with them.|$|E

Adrian Havill questioned these claims in his 1993 biography of Woodward and Bernstein, stating Woodward's balcony faced an interior courtyard and was not visible from the street, but Woodward responded that it has been bricked in since he lived there. Havill also claimed that copies of The Times were not delivered marked by apartment, but Woodward and a former neighbor disputed this claim. Woodward has stated: ...|$|E

There are rectangular stone benches between <b>flowerpots</b> at the same side under the pergola, which are for the audience to sip tea and rest. At the periphery of the pergola there is an arc-shaped moat, with five bridges serving as five passageways of the music stage. The wisteria corridor is spread in a semicircle, forming a rhythm of equidistance and beauty of melody.|$|R

According to court documents, James said, [...] "She began screaming and yelling at me...and punching me. She punched me in the face several times." [...] Jesse was unable to defend himself because his right arm had recently undergone surgery. According to court documents, by the time the police arrived, Lindemulder had already hit James {{in the back of the}} head with a <b>flowerpot,</b> and attacked him with a metal sculpture. James also claimed that Lindemulder punched him in the eye on February 13, 2003 - and attempted to run him over with a vehicle in May of that year.|$|E
