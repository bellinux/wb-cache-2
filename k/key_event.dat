5|$|Westinghouse Electric asked Tesla to {{participate}} in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago where the company had a large space in a building devoted to electrical exhibits. Westinghouse Electric won the bid to light the Exposition with alternating current and it was a <b>key</b> <b>event</b> in the history of AC power, as the company demonstrated to the American public the safety, reliability, and efficiency of a fully integrated alternating current system. Tesla showed a series of electrical effects related to alternating current as well as his wireless lighting system, using a demonstration he had previously performed throughout America and Europe; these included using high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current to light a wireless gas-discharge lamp.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{departure}} of the Romans, the Sheffield area may have been {{the southern part of the}} Brittonic kingdom of Elmet, with the rivers Sheaf and Don forming part of the boundary between this kingdom and the kingdom of Mercia. Gradually, Anglian settlers pushed west from the kingdom of Deira. A Britonnic presence within the Sheffield area is evidenced by two settlements called Wales and Waleswood close to Sheffield. The settlements that grew and merged to form Sheffield, however, date from the second half of the first millennium, and are of Anglo-Saxon and Danish origin. In Anglo-Saxon times, the Sheffield area straddled the border between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that Eanred of Northumbria submitted to Egbert of Wessex at the hamlet of Dore (now a suburb of Sheffield) in 829, a <b>key</b> <b>event</b> in the unification of the kingdom of England under the House of Wessex.|$|E
5|$|For most of {{the last}} century {{military}} service {{has been one of the}} single greatest shared experiences of white Australian males, and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars during the second half of the 20th century, it continues to influence Australian society to this day. War and military service have been defining influences in Australian history, while a major part of the national identity has been built on an idealised conception of the Australian experience of war and of soldiering, known as the Anzac spirit. These ideals include notions of endurance, courage, ingenuity, humour, larrikinism, egalitarianism and mateship; traits which, according to popular thought, defined the behaviour of Australian soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during the First World War. The Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians and has been seen as a <b>key</b> <b>event</b> in forging a sense of national identity.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to hazard-oriented <b>key</b> <b>events,</b> properties such as stability or bioaccumulation {{can serve as}} further building blocks for testing strategies [116]. Bio-persistent accumulative entities of nanomaterials, capable of inducing <b>key</b> <b>events</b> responsible for long-term toxicity, would be allocated to a testing strategy where further testing is needed. In contrast, nanomaterials that are not triggering such <b>key</b> <b>events</b> would be allocated to a group where no such additional testing is required. The assignment of substances and nanomaterials to predefined testing strategies based on AOPs further support Green Toxicology. Data on the induction of <b>key</b> <b>events</b> of relevant AOPs could be screened by in vitro assays and serve as gatekeepers in innovation processes.|$|R

5|$|Although the Giants were {{successful}} {{on the field}} in their initial seasons, they struggled financially. A <b>key</b> <b>event</b> in franchise history occurred in the 11th game of the Giants inaugural season. The Chicago Bears, led by star running back Red Grange, came to town attracting a then pro football record 73,000 fans, and giving the Giants a much needed financial influx. The following year, Grange and his agent formed a rival league and stationed a competing team, led by Grange, in New York. Though the Giants lost $50,000 that season, the rival league folded and was subsumed into the NFL. After these initial struggles, the Giants financial status stabilized, and they {{led the league in}} attendance several times in the 1930s and 1940s. By the early 1960s, the Giants had firmly established themselves as one of the league's biggest attractions. However, rather than continue to receive their higher share of the league television revenue, the Mara sons pushed for equal sharing of revenue {{for the benefit of the}} entire league. Revenue sharing is still practiced in the NFL today, and is credited with strengthening the league.|$|E

25|$|In 1893, George Westinghouse won the bid {{to light}} the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago with {{alternating}} current, slightly underbidding General Electric to get the contract. This World's Fair devoted a building to electrical exhibits. It was a <b>key</b> <b>event</b> {{in the history of}} AC power, as Westinghouse demonstrated the safety, reliability, and efficiency of a fully integrated alternating current system to the American public.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>key</b> <b>event</b> in {{the further}} {{development}} of algebra was the general algebraic solution of the cubic and quartic equations, developed in the mid-16th century. The idea of a determinant was developed by Japanese mathematician Kowa Seki in the 17th century, followed by Gottfried Leibniz ten years later, {{for the purpose of}} solving systems of simultaneous linear equations using matrices. Gabriel Cramer also did some work on matrices and determinants in the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|A <b>key</b> <b>event</b> for {{electricity}} markets occurred in 1990 when the UK government under Margaret Thatcher privatised the UK electricity supply industry. The process {{followed by the}} British was then used as a model {{or at least a}} catalyst for the deregulation of several other Commonwealth countries, notably Australia and New Zealand, and regional markets such as Alberta. However, in many of these other instances the market deregulation occurred without the widespread privatisation that characterised the UK example.|$|E

25|$|Another <b>key</b> <b>event</b> {{that takes}} place in the ER is N-linked glycosylation. In this process, polypeptides that have a unique stretch of 3 amino acids (asparagine - X - serine/threonine, where X {{represents}} any amino acid except proline) are modified with a complex sugar moiety on the amide group of asparagine. Other types of glycosylations include S-linked (via cysteine residues), C-linked (via tryptophan) and O-linked (via serine or threonine). By far, N-linked glycosylation is the most abundant post-translational modification found in eukaryotic cells.|$|E
25|$|The Siege of Bangkok was a <b>key</b> <b>event</b> of the Siamese {{revolution}} of 1688, {{in which the}} Kingdom of Siam ousted the French from Siam. Following a coup d'état, in which the pro-Western king Narai was replaced by Phetracha, Siamese troops besieged the French fortress in Bangkok for four months. The Siamese were able to muster about 40,000 troops, equipped with cannon, against the entrenched 200 French troops, but the military confrontation proved inconclusive. Tensions between the two belligerents progressively subsided, and finally a negotiated settlement was reached allowing the French to leave the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} {{significance of the}} conflict is disputed between Argentine historians. Revisionist authors consider it a <b>key</b> <b>event</b> {{in the history of}} Argentina, next to the Argentine War of Independence, while traditional historians disagree. A recent example of this conflicting viewpoints took place on November 18, 2010, before the first celebration of the National Sovereignty day (in commemoration of the main battle of the conflict, the Battle of Vuelta de Obligado) as a national holiday. The newspaper La Nación interviewed revisionist historian Pacho O'Donnell, traditional historian Luis Alberto Romero and British historian David Rock.|$|E
