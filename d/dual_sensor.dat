Activity sensing was adequate in all patients. The contribution of each sensor (sensor blending) is programmable for each patient. Of 75 patients assessed at 1 month after implant, three have been programmed to ''Activity-Only'' mode, and 72 to <b>dual</b> <b>sensor</b> mode. Of these, 18 have been programmed to ''QT Activity. '' Forty-five patients underwent exercise testing in <b>dual</b> <b>sensor</b> mode and a subgroup of 15 also underwent exercise testing in Activity-Only mode.

40|$|Rotational {{speed is}} a key {{parameter}} for condition monitoring and control of rotating devices in many industrial processes. This paper presents a technique for the rotational speed measurement using a single or <b>dual</b> electrostatic <b>sensors</b> coupled with correlation signal processing algorithms. In {{the case of a}} single sensor, autocorrelation algorithm is applied to process the signal and measure the period of the rotational motion. In the case of <b>dual</b> <b>sensors,</b> cross correlation algorithm is applied to obtain the time delay between the two signals and hence the measurement of rotational speed. The fundamental characteristics of the sensing techniques with single or <b>dual</b> <b>sensors</b> for different sized rotors are studied through finite-element modeling. Experimental tests were conducted on a purpose-built test rig to assess the performance of both techniques over the speed range of 100 - 3000 r/min. The rotors used in the experimental tests are made of polyvinyl chloride with a diameter of 60 and 120 mm, respectively. Experimental results suggest that the measurement system using a single sensor is capable of producing repeatable rotational speed measurement with a maximum error of ± 1. 2 % over the speed range of 600 - 3000 r/min. However, the measurement system with <b>dual</b> electrostatic <b>sensors</b> is capable of achieving valid measurements over a wider range of speeds (100 - 2000 r/min), although the measurement error is larger than that of the single-sensor system.

40|$|An optical <b>dual</b> <b>sensor</b> for {{oxygen and}} {{temperature}} is presented {{that is highly}} oxygen sensitive and covers a broad temperature range. Dual sensing is based on luminescence lifetime measurements. The novel sensor contains two luminescent compounds incorporated into polymer films. The temperature-sensitive dye (ruthenium tris- 1, 10 -phenanthroline) has a highly temperature-dependent luminescence and is incorporated in poly(acrylonitrile) to avoid cross-sensitivity to oxygen. Fullerene C 70 {{was used as the}} oxygen-sensitive probe owing to its strong thermally activated delayed fluorescence at elevated temperatures that is extremely oxygen sensitive. The cross-sensitivity of C 70 to temperature is accounted for by means of the temperature sensor. C 70 is incorporated into a highly oxygen-permeable polymer, either ethyl cellulose or organosilica. The two luminescent probes have different emission spectra and decay times, and their emissions can be discriminated using both parameters. Spatially resolved sensing is achieved by means of fluorescence lifetime imaging. The response times of the sensor to oxygen are short. The <b>dual</b> <b>sensor</b> exhibits a temperature operation range between at least 0 and 120 °C, and detection limits for oxygen in the ppbv range, operating for oxygen concentrations up to at least 50 ppmv. These ranges outperform all dual oxygen and temperature sensors reported so far. The <b>dual</b> <b>sensor</b> presented in this study is especially appropriate for measurements under extreme conditions such as high temperatures and ultralow oxygen levels.

40|$|Wound repair is a {{quiescent}} {{mechanism to}} restore barriers in multicellular organisms upon injury. In chronic wounds, however, this program prematurely stalls. It {{is known that}} patterns of extracellular signals within the wound fluid are crucial to healing. Extracellular pH (pHe) is precisely regulated and potentially important in signaling within wounds due to its diverse cellular effects. Additionally, sufficient oxygenation {{is a prerequisite for}} cell proliferation and protein synthesis during tissue repair. It was, however, impossible to study these parameters in vivo {{due to the lack of}} imaging tools. Here, we present luminescent biocompatible <b>sensor</b> foils for <b>dual</b> imaging of pHe and oxygenation in vivo. To visualize pHe and oxygen, we used time-domain dual lifetime referencing (tdDLR) and luminescence lifetime imaging (LLI), respectively. With these <b>dual</b> <b>sensors,</b> we discovered centripetally increasing pHe-gradients on human chronic wound surfaces. In a therapeutic approach, we identify pHe-gradients as pivotal governors of cell proliferation and migration, and show that these pHe-gradients disrupt epidermal barrier repair, thus wound closure. Parallel oxygen imaging also revealed marked hypoxia, albeit with no correlating oxygen partial pressure (pO 2) -gradient. This highlights the distinct role of pHe-gradients in perturbed healing. We also found that pHe-gradients on chronic wounds of humans are predominantly generated via centrifugally increasing pHe-regulatory Na+/H+-exchanger- 1 (NHE 1) -expression. We show that the modification of pHe on chronic wound surfaces poses a promising strategy to improve healing. The study has broad implications for cell science where spatial pHe-variations play key roles, e. g. in tumor growth.

The green-emitting iridium(III) complex [Ir(ppy) 2 (carbac) ] (ppy= 2 -phenylpyridine; carbac= 1 -(9 H-carbazol- 9 -yl) - 5, 5 -dimethylhexane- 2, 4 -dione) was applied as a novel probe for T {{along with the}} red-emitting complex [Ir(btpy) 3], (btpy= 2 -(benzo[b]thiophene- 2 -yl) pyridine) which functions as a barometric (in fact oxygen-sensitive) probe. Both iridium complexes were dissolved in different polymer materials to achieve optimal responses. The probe [Ir(ppy) 2 (carbac) ] was dispersed in gas-blocking poly(acrylonitrile) microparticles in order to suppress any quenching of its luminescence by oxygen. The barometric probe [Ir(btpy) 3], in turn, was incorporated in a cellulose acetate butyrate film which exhibits good permeability for oxygen. The effects of temperature on {{the response of the}} oxygen probe can be corrected by simultaneous optical determination of T, as the poly(acrylonitrile) microparticles containing the temperature indicator are incorporated into the film. The phosphorescent signals of the probes for T and barometric pressure, respectively, can be separated by optical filters due to the ≈ 75  nm difference in their emission maxima.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA microelectromechanical direction-finding sensor {{has been developed}} based on the mechanically coupled ears of the Ormia ochracea fly. Previous designs determined the direction of sound relative to the normal of the sensor by using the sound pressure level at the sensor. However, these designs suffered from a left-right ambiguity. To overcome these shortcomings, a <b>dual</b> <b>sensor</b> assembly was created. Two sensors co-located at an offset angle allow direction finding across 120 °. This eliminated ambiguous angles and the requirement for a sound pressure level. For this study, the <b>dual</b> <b>sensor</b> assembly was fabricated using two custom circuit boards powered by a 9 V battery and arranged on a 3 D-printed mount. The resonant frequency of the sensors produced a 260 V/Pa output at 1. 690 kHz ± 20 Hz. Experimental work was done in an anechoic chamber, and outputs were captured using lock-in amplifiers. The angle error ranged from less than 0. 3 ° close to the normal axis (0 °) to 3. 4 ° at the limits of coverage, ± 60 °.
