In 1984, John Naisbitt theorized {{that the future}} would be driven largely by information: companies that managed information well could obtain an advantage, however the profitability {{of what he called}} [...] "information float" [...] (information that the company had and others desired) would disappear as inexpensive computers made information more accessible.|$|R

25|$|The {{government}} again misjudged the situation, {{in particular}} the strength of popular feeling, and <b>how</b> <b>few</b> troops were available to resolve the crisis by force. Kuhn was instructed to reject the insurgents' demands, but on his return to Lausanne he promised a general amnesty and the abolition of all feudal taxes on his own authority.

50|$|The doctor {{then goes}} into the social stigma {{associated}} with syphilis, {{and the fact that}} so many people will not get a blood test to check for syphilis. He notes in his native Scandinavia, people were much more open about it, and it was a normal sight for people to get a blood test for syphilis. He shows a diagram of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, which he says has a comparable population as the State of New York, and <b>how</b> <b>fewer</b> Scandinavians have VD than New Yorkers, The film ends with a plea for everyone to get a blood test.|$|R

25|$|Bid-a-Noteâ€”The host read {{a clue to}} a {{song and}} the contestants alternated bidding as to <b>how</b> <b>few</b> notes (from a maximum of seven) they needed to {{identify}} the song. Bidding ended when one contestant challenged the other to name the tune or a bid of one (or even zero) notes was given by a player. Correctly identifying the song earned the contestant a point, while missing it gave the point to the opponent.

25|$|Military {{training}} and strategy are two important matters {{on which the}} sources are more than usually silent. There are no references in literature or laws to men training, {{and so it is}} necessary to fall back on inference. For the noble warrior, his childhood was of first importance in learning both individual military skills and the teamwork essential for success in battle. Perhaps the games the youthful Cuthbert played ('wrestling, jumping, running, and every other exercise') had some military significance. Turning to strategy, of the period before Alfred the evidence gives the Impression that Anglo-Saxon armies fought battles frequently. If this is not solely due to the deficiencies of the sources, it would make England a special case. Battle was risky and best avoided unless all the factors were on your side. But if you were in a position so advantageous that you were willing to take the chance, it is likely that your enemy would be in such a weak position that he would avoid battle and pay tribute. Unless, of course, he was Bede's Oswald and trusted in God. Anyway, battle put the princes' lives at risk, as is demonstrated by the Northumbrian and Mercian overlordships brought to an end by a defeat in the field. Gillingham has shown <b>how</b> <b>few</b> pitched battles successful Charlemagne and Richard I chose to fight.|$|E

"America {{still has}} a {{constitutional}} protection of free speech, and I have been amazed... to see <b>how</b> <b>few</b> {{people in this country}} are willing to stick up for that elementary principle... a country once famous for free speech is now hysterically and expensively sensitive to anything that could be taken as a slight." ...|$|E

500|$|Dale Allison, a Christian theologian, views these lyrics as a song-wide message where Harrison [...] "mourns <b>how</b> <b>few</b> {{are working}} for a better world and paying homage to God". Allison refutes the idea of any elitism or superiority in Harrison's compositions, suggesting: [...] "George nowhere claims to have arrived he is rather always a pilgrim, always on the road. In the words of 'The Day the World Gets 'Round,' {{he is one of}} those who has 'made a start,' nothing more." ...|$|E

500|$|Transfusion {{replaced}} [...] "Heart Shaped Box" [...] by Nirvana {{at the top}} of the ARIA alternative music chart in 1993. Despite appearing {{a notable}} achievement, Fanning downplayed its significance, telling Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "All it did was make us aware of <b>how</b> <b>few</b> people buy records."

500|$|Famitsus writers {{expressed}} disappointment {{over how}} the PSP version's graphics and screen size had not been changed {{in comparison to the}} Sega Saturn version, and of <b>how</b> <b>few</b> adjustments had been made.

500|$|To {{monitor the}} kakapo {{population}} continuously, each bird {{is equipped with}} a radio transmitter. Every known kakapo, barring some young chicks, has been given a name by Kakapo Recovery Programme officials. It is an affectionate way for conservation staff to refer to individual birds, and a stark reminder of <b>how</b> <b>few</b> remain.

[...] When the Americans opened fire, it was [...] "a heavy and well-directed fire", according to one British officer. [...] The battle lasted for more than 2 hours, until both sides were nearly out of ammunition, and the British were virtually surrounded by Americans. [...] The sound of Indian war whoops from the north prompted the Americans to retreat, and they retired to the fort with their wounded, including Van Rensselaer, who had taken a shot in the hip.|$|E
