5|$|Following his baptism, Edwin's Northumbrian priests were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to}} {{suppress}} pagan practices in Eorpwald's kingdom and convert the East Anglians. The conversion had the general political benefit of bringing the entire eastern seaboard from Northumbria to Kent, {{with the exception of}} Essex, under the dominion of Edwin and his Christian allies.|$|E

He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on April 1, 1940.|$|E

5|$|After Actium and {{the defeat}} of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> rule the entire Republic under an {{unofficial}} principate—but he had to achieve this through incremental power gains. He did so by courting the Senate and the people while upholding the republican traditions of Rome, appearing {{that he was not}} aspiring to dictatorship or monarchy. Marching into Rome, Octavian and Marcus Agrippa were elected as dual consuls by the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Although Emily Huskisson {{had wanted}} to keep the service {{small-scale}} and free from pageantry, William Huskisson had been an instrumental figure in the development of Liverpool and there was a huge amount of sympathy and respect for him. Almost all the city's inhabitants who were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> attend the funeral lined the route; it was estimated that 69,000 people, roughly half the city's population, attended. Reports spoke of all available space at every window being packed with onlookers, other than the house in Duke Street in which Huskisson had stayed for the 10 days before the journey, and of people climbing trees and crowding onto roofs for a better view, despite rain and hail.|$|E
5|$|Although {{one of the}} plaintiffs' witnesses, a {{chartered}} land surveyor, {{had suggested}} that the authorities could redevelop the land in a different manner, he did not state that the authorities' redevelopment plan was wrong or indefensible. The court was not <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> decide which plans for redeveloping areas in Singapore were better. Thus, the acquisition of the temple property had not infringed Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E

5|$|Arnold was not <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> {{influence}} what transpired at Fort Griswold, as {{he remained}} in New London and observed the action at Fort Griswold across the river. He was blamed by many on both sides for the affair, however, {{because he was the}} commanding officer who bore full responsibility for the actions of his men. American sentiments were further inflamed against him for the simple fact that he had betrayed and killed those among whom he had grown up.|$|E
5|$|At first Catherine {{kept the}} nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close to her, and slept in his chamber. She presided over his council, decided policy, and {{controlled}} state business and patronage. However, {{she was never}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> control {{the country as a}} whole, which was on the brink of civil war. In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and in some ways difficult for her to comprehend as a foreigner.|$|E
5|$|Cagney's last {{movie in}} 1935 was Ceiling Zero, his third film with Pat O'Brien. O'Brien {{received}} top billing, {{which was a}} clear breach of Cagney's contract. This, combined {{with the fact that}} Cagney had made five movies in 1934, again against his contract terms, caused him to bring legal proceedings against Warner Bros. for breach of contract. The dispute dragged on for several months. Cagney received calls from David Selznick and Sam Goldwyn, but neither felt <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> offer him work while the dispute went on. Meanwhile, while being represented by his brother William in court, Cagney went back to New York to search for a country property where he could indulge his passion for farming.|$|E

As a member of the then-unseen Syndicate, he was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> know a great deal of information. Deep Throat felt that the truth the Syndicate kept secret from the public needed to be known, and believed Mulder to be the one person capable of exposing this knowledge. However, during the disappearance of Max Fenig, Deep Throat provided Mulder with false information in order to divert him, later explaining that he believed the public was just not ready to know some truths.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Sounds President Larry Schmittou {{noticed a}} 5%drop in season ticket sales, a higher ratio of no-shows from season ticket holders, {{and a slight}} decline in overall attendance. These issues with spectator turnout were {{accompanied}} by a decline in local media coverage, particularly in regard to road games. In order to boost interest in the team, Schmittou tried, unsuccessfully, to purchase a Triple-A franchise late in the 1983 season. His desire to land a Triple-A team {{was part of a}} larger plan to put Nashville <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> contend for a major league franchise in the future. Attendance continued to drop in 1984, as season ticket sales were down 12% and overall attendance was down almost 20%.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Norberto Fontana {{claimed in}} an {{interview}} with the Argentinian newspaper Olé that a few hours before the Grand Prix the Ferrari team director Jean Todt visited the Sauber motorhome and told the Swiss team, which used Ferrari engines at the time, that the Saubers must block Jacques Villeneuve if they were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> do so in order to help Michael Schumacher win the World Championship.|$|E

A {{civil war in}} Gwynedd in the 810s ended with the {{succession}} of Hywel ap Caradog in 816 or 817, and Coenwulf invaded again, this time ravaging Snowdonia and taking control of Rhufuniog, a small Welsh territory near Rhos. It is not clear if the Mercians {{were involved in a}} battle recorded in Anglesey in 817 or 818, but the following year Coenwulf and his army devastated Dyfed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the evidence of the}} Chronicle that Æthelberht was accorded the title of bretwalda, there is evidence of his domination in several of the southern kingdoms of the Heptarchy. In Essex, Æthelberht appears to have been <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> exercise authority shortly after 604, when his intervention helped in the conversion of King Sæberht of Essex, his nephew, to Christianity. It was Æthelberht, and not Sæberht, who built and endowed St. Pauls in London, where St Paul's Cathedral now stands. Further evidence is provided by Bede, who explicitly describes Æthelberht as Sæberht's overlord.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in the Jordan Valley, Chaytor's Force faced stiff {{opposition}} from the Ottoman front line troops. As a consequence of progress made by the 160th Brigade during the afternoon of 19 September, one of the brigade's mountain batteries {{was able to get}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> fire on Bakr Ridge. At 14:25, supported by the 160th Brigade's battery, three companies of the 2nd Battalion British West Indies Regiment (Chaytor's Force) destroyed Ottoman outposts and captured a ridge to the south of Bakr Ridge, despite intense artillery and machine gun fire. Under heavy fire, they dug in and held their position while two regiments of 2nd Light Horse Brigade were able to advance towards Shunet Nimrin.|$|E

5|$|Mountbatten {{believed}} that securing the states' accession to India {{was crucial to}} reaching a negotiated settlement with the Congress for the transfer of power.

The princes also {{believed that}} he would be <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> ensure that independent India adhered to any terms that might be agreed upon, because Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Patel had asked him to become the first Governor General of the Dominion of India.|$|E
5|$|New manager Craig Brown {{successfully}} guided Scotland to the 1996 European Championship tournament. The {{first game}} against the Netherlands ended 0–0, raising morale ahead of a much anticipated game against England at Wembley. Gary McAllister missed a penalty kick, and a goal by Paul Gascoigne led to a 2–0 defeat. Scotland recovered to beat Switzerland 1–0 with a goal by Ally McCoist. England taking a 4–0 lead in the other match briefly put both teams <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> qualify, but a late goal for the Netherlands meant that Scotland were knocked out on goals scored.|$|E
5|$|On 16 May, Morgan was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> {{advance in}} force into Merthyr, pushing forward and taking {{advantage}} of the poor communications between the various elements of the insurgency. The uprising collapsed, and {{over the next few days}} the authorities regained control, making arrests and forcing the workers back to business. Government inquiries into the incident began and Bute, among others, provided analysis and reports to Whitehall. In the aftermath, Richard Lewis, one of the radical crowd, was hanged in Cardiff. The execution proved controversial and it is unknown whether Bute, who had by then left to attend Parliament in London, approved of the decision.|$|E
