In the past, the agricultural data system suffered from significant gaps, some duplications and occasional issues on the relevance of some data series to users. The major reasons were: (1) the agency responsible for agricultural statistics, the then Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAEcon), was originally set up as a user rather than a producer of statistics, (2) the development of agriculture statistics received very low priority in the sharing of limited resources allotted to the statistical system, and (3) the widespread duplication of statistical activities among government agencies resulting in conflicting figures and confusion among data users.|$|R

ONI states that:As a stable democracy with strong protections for press freedom, India’s experiments with Internet filtering have been brought into the fold of public discourse. The selective censorship of Web sites and blogs since 2003, made even more disjointed by the non-uniform responses of Internet service providers (ISPs), has inspired a clamor of opposition. Clearly government regulation and implementation of filtering are still evolving. … Amidst widespread speculation in the media and blogosphere about the state of filtering in India, the sites actually blocked indicate that while the filtering system in place yields inconsistent results, it nevertheless continues to be aligned with and driven <b>by</b> <b>government</b> <b>efforts.</b> <b>Government</b> attempts at filtering have not been entirely effective, as blocked content has quickly migrated to other Web sites and users have found ways to circumvent filtering. The government has also been criticized for a poor understanding of the technical feasibility of censorship and for haphazardly choosing which Web sites to block. The amended IT Act, absolving intermediaries from being responsible for third-party created content, could signal stronger government monitoring in the future.|$|R

40|$|The last {{forty years}} have marked a dynamic era in {{affordable}} housing. During this time, affordable housing shifted from being largely government-owned to privately-owned, though certainly supported <b>by</b> <b>government</b> <b>efforts.</b> This evolution thus marked a distinct switch from a supply-side {{approach to a}} demand-side approach to affordable housing. As states and localities adapted to this paradigm shift, some high-priced metropolitan regions discovered that their housing markets were squeezing out middle-income service workers, such as police officers and teachers. In response, many localities—and some states—adopted various laws and policies to spur the creation of workforce housing: that is, moderately-priced housing that is affordable and desirable for these middle-income workers. These types of efforts seemed—and, indeed, were—necessary for these metropolitan areas when the housing market was at its peak in the mid- 2000 s. However, with the Great Recession came a bursting of the housing bubble, and home prices dropped dramatically all around the country. With the correction in the housing market, the continued need for workforce housing programs is less clear. In {{the context of the}} changes in affordable housing, this article seeks to analyze workforce housing’s place in the affordable housing landscape and explore the need for workforce housing in the future...|$|R

40|$|For {{a period}} of roughly thirty-five years, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan pursued {{industrial}} policies aimed at altering the sectoral structure of production toward sectors believed to offer greater prospects for accelerated growth than a typical process of industrial evolution would generate. All developing countries, excluding perhaps Hong Kong, have employed and continue to use industrial policy, broadly defined. Credit directed at specific sectors at below market interest rates for long term and working capital, sectorally differentiated profit taxes, subsidized electricity rates, research and development subsidies, con-trol of the entry and exit of firms, and highly differentiated tariffs and nontariff barriers are all forms of industrial policy. Several Asian coun-tries, particularly Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, are exemplars of these efforts. Given their performance over this period, {{it is tempting to}} con-clude that industrial policy played a decisive role in their success. In analyzing the impact of industrial policy, it is important to distinguish between the initiation of industrialization and its con-tinuance once a higher level of growth was achieved. The recovery in Japan between 1945 and 1955 or 1960 was probably accelerated <b>by</b> <b>government</b> <b>efforts</b> to restore prewar levels of capacity and productiv-ity in sectors such as mining, cotton spinning, and steel.

40|$|Nearly {{fifty years}} {{after the passage of}} the Fair Housing Act, race-based {{residential}} segregation remains remarkably persistent, as do significant racial disparities in economic well-being. This Comment argues that one contributing factor to the persistence of segregation is different access to legal protections for property value enjoyed by minority and white homeowners. Historically, local land use regulations like zoning effectively served as legally permissible 2 ̆ 2 race-neutral 2 ̆ 2 means of replacing expressly race-based means of keeping 2 ̆ 2 undesirables 2 ̆ 2 out of white middle-class neighborhoods. Congress enacted the Fair Housing Act in 1968 to counter this deeply entrenched form of discrimination and to help achieve 2 ̆ 2 truly integrated and balanced living patterns. 2 ̆ 2 But in practice, many federal courts interpreting this civil rights statute have come to see themselves as the guardians of the property interests of middle-class and white families, overprotecting these families from perceived threats to property value caused <b>by</b> <b>government</b> <b>efforts</b> to promote integration. At the same time, these courts underprotect low-income and minority families from property value depreciation and displacement caused by 2 ̆ 2 environmental segregation 2 ̆ 2 and redevelopment. A closer look at the disparity in judicial treatment reveals a critical bias: an unquestioning acceptance of the assertion that the very presence of low-income and minority families can lead to the loss of property value. In order to move beyond the zero-sum game that pits the property interests of middle-class and white residents against those of low-income and minority residents, courts must end the legal double standard that allows the residual harms and unequal benefits of historical segregation to continue accruing to this day...|$|R
