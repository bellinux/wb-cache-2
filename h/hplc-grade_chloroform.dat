(Japan) with the structural formula Ca 0. 11 Na 0. 891 (Si 7. 63 Al 0. 37) (Al 3. 053 Mg 0. 65 Fe 0. 245 Ti 0. 015) O 20 (OH) 4 and cation-exchange capacity (CEC) 1. 18 meq g- 1 of clay. The stock dispersion of the clay was prepared by stirring 1 g of clay for 12 hours in 1 litre of Millipore ultrapure water. The dispersion was diluted to a given concentration with pure water before being used as subphase in the LS deposition. Surfactant Dimethyldioctadecylammonium (DODA) bromide (purity 99 + %, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as received. DODA was dissolved in a mixture of <b>HPLC-grade</b> <b>chloroform</b> and methanol (9 : 1 in volume) to prepare a spreading solution of 0. 1 mg ml- 1.
