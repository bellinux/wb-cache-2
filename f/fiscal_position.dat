CBO projected in its January 2001 baseline that the U.S. would have a total of $5.6 trillion in annual surpluses over the 2002-2011 decade, assuming the laws in place during the Clinton era continued and the economy performed as expected. However, the actual deficits during those years ended up being $6.1 trillion, a negative swing of $11.7 trillion. Two recessions, two wars, and tax cuts were the primary drivers of the differences.|$|E
25|$|Fletcher {{argued that}} the PC party did not run on {{creating}} a new Crown corporation. That the new crown corporation went far beyond what the government had stated and included items such as potable water. His main argument is that Manitoba has a massive supply of hydro generated power and continues to build more generation {{at the cost of}} billions of dollars, with no where to sell the power. Fletcher argues that the demand side management of power usage is not appropriate in the Manitoba context. This is because supply of power will exceed the demand for power until 2044. Combine with the facts that 97% of Manitoba power generation is clean, cheap, green energy, it does not help the environment or hydro <b>fiscal</b> <b>position</b> to reduce the demand of a product that Manitoba has far too much of. In addition, due to the over building undertaken by Manitoba Hydro under the previous government, Hydro {{has no choice but to}} raise rates. This in itself will reduce demand. The additional cost of creating a crown will increase rates further due to the huge expense.|$|E

In a panel regression over the period from 1988 to 2007, we find a robust and significant effect of fiscal performance on long-term bond yields.

2500|$|The {{cause of}} this {{conflict}} was the complex border between the two towns. Brugg had only possessed a thin strip of land, known as the [...] "Burgerziel," [...] around the town’s old wall. To the south of this was the “Ehfäde,” which was agricultural land located in a special district owned entirely by citizens of Brugg. Although all changes in ownership had {{to be approved by}} Brugg, the land was politically and taxably part of Windisch. The town had repeatedly attempted to acquire the territory, but to no avail. In 1856 the cantonal government found that the situation was no longer appropriate and awarded control of the Ehfäde to Windisch. Windisch, however, was in a difficult <b>fiscal</b> <b>position</b> and found itself in need of funds. In 1863 they agreed to sell the land, where the train station was located, to Brugg for 25,000 Swiss Francs.|$|E

2500|$|His mother Anne's {{death in}} 1438 {{transformed}} his <b>fiscal</b> <b>position.</b> His inheritance from her included {{the remainder of}} his father's estates, which were worth about £1,500, and his mother's half of the Bohun inheritance of around another £1,200. The latter also included the earldom of Buckingham, which brought a further £1,000, and {{made him one of the}} greatest landowners in England. [...] "His landed resources matched his titles" [...] explained Albert Compton-Reves, scattered as they were throughout England, Wales and Ireland. In fact, it is likely that only the King, and the Duke of York were wealthier in the kingdom. One assessment of his estates suggests that, by the late 1440s, his income was over £5,000 per annum, and K.B. McFarlane estimated Stafford's total potential income from land to have been £6,300 gross annually, at its peak between 1447 and 1448. On the other hand, it is also possible that the actual income yielded from them could have been as low as £3,700, In any case, it is likely that, on average, he annually overspent by approximately £300. [...] Exacerbating this, for Stafford, was that rents owed to him were not always paid: even a lord of the status of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, for example, owed Buckingham over £100 in unpaid rent for the manor of Drayton Bassett in 1458. In the 1440s and 1450s, Buckingham's Welsh estates were particularly notable for both their rent arrears and public disorder.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{boom and}} bust in {{commodity}} prices has raised concerns {{about the impact of}} volatile commodity prices on Latin American countries’ <b>fiscal</b> <b>positions.</b> Using a novel quarterly dataset─ which includes unique country specific commodity price indices and a comprehensive measure of public expenditures─ this paper analyzes the dynamic effects of commodity price fluctuations on fiscal revenues and expenditures for 8 commodity exporting Latin American countries. The results indicate that Latin American countries’ <b>fiscal</b> <b>positions</b> generally react strongly to shocks to commodity prices, yet there are marked differences across countries in observed reactions. Fiscal variables in Venezuela display the highest sensitivity to commodity price shocks, with expenditures reacting significantly more than revenues. On {{the other side of the}} spectrum, Chile’s fiscal indicators react very little to commodity price fluctuations, and their dynamic responses are very similar to those seen in high-income commodity exporting countries. A plausible explanation to this distinct behavior across countries could be related to the efficient application of fiscal rules, accompanied by strong institutions, political commitment and high standards of transparency. ...|$|R
