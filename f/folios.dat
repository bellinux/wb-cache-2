5|$|In manuscripts, the De Iniusta {{normally}} appears alongside Symeon of Durham's Historiae Ecclesiae Dunelmensis. There are {{at least}} six manuscripts of the De Iniusta, with the earliest being Bodleian MS Fairfax 6, probably dating from about 1375. The others are Bodleian MS Laud misc. 700 <b>folios</b> 66–74v, Hales MS 114 <b>folios</b> 63–75v (although this is missing the introduction {{and part of the}} conclusion), Cotton MS Claudius D IV <b>folios</b> 48–54 (likewise missing the introduction and parts of the conclusion), Harleian MS 4843 <b>folios</b> 224–231, and Durham Bishop Cosins Library MS V ii 6 folio 88–98.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Kells {{contains}} the four Gospels of the Christian scriptures written in black, red, purple, and yellow ink in an insular majuscule script, preceded by prefaces, summaries, and concordances of Gospel passages. Today, {{it consists of}} 340 vellum leaves, or <b>folios.</b> The majority of the <b>folios</b> are part of larger sheets, called bifolios, which are folded in half to form two <b>folios.</b> The bifolios are nested inside {{of each other and}} sewn together to form gatherings called quires. On occasion, a folio is not part of a bifolio but is instead a single sheet inserted within a quire. The extant <b>folios</b> are gathered into 38 quires. There are between four and twelve <b>folios</b> (two to six bifolios) per quire; the <b>folios</b> are commonly, but not invariably, bound in groups of ten. Some <b>folios</b> are single sheets, as is frequently the case with the important decorated pages. The <b>folios</b> had lines drawn for the text, sometimes on both sides, after the bifolios were folded. Prick marks and guide lines can still be seen on some pages. The vellum is of high quality, although the <b>folios</b> have an uneven thickness, with some being close to leather while others are so thin as to be almost translucent.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{is written}} primarily in insular majuscule with some occurrences of minuscule letters (usually e or s). The text is usually written in one long line across the page. Françoise Henry identified {{at least three}} scribes in this manuscript, whom she named Hand A, Hand B, and Hand C. Hand A is found on <b>folios</b> 1 through 19v, <b>folios</b> 276 through 289, and <b>folios</b> 307 {{through the end of}} the manuscript. Hand A, for the most part, writes eighteen or nineteen lines per page in the brown gall-ink common throughout the West. Hand B is found on <b>folios</b> 19r through 26 and <b>folios</b> 124 through 128. Hand B has a somewhat greater tendency to use minuscule and uses red, purple and black ink and a variable number of lines per page. Hand C is found throughout the majority of the text. Hand C also has greater tendency to use minuscule than Hand A. Hand C uses the same brownish gall-ink used by hand A and wrote, almost always, seventeen lines per page.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{fragments}} of the lists of Hebrew names; one on the recto of the first surviving folio and one on folio 26, which is currently inserted {{at the end of}} the prefatory matter for John. The first list fragment contains the end of the list for the Gospel of Matthew. The missing names from Matthew would require an additional two <b>folios.</b> The second list fragment, on folio 26, contains about a fourth of the list for Luke. The list for Luke would require an additional three <b>folios.</b> The structure of the quire in which folio 26 occurs is such that it is unlikely that there are three <b>folios</b> missing between <b>folios</b> 26 and 27, so that it is almost certain that folio 26 is not now in its original location. There is no trace of the lists for Mark and John.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>folios</b> and quartos were {{subsequently}} published—including John Smethwick's Q3, Q4, and Q5 (1611–37)—but these {{are regarded as}} derivatives {{of the first three}} editions.|$|E
5|$|The codex is in quarto, and now {{consists}} of 773 vellum <b>folios</b> (630 in the Old Testament and 143 in the New Testament), bound in four volumes (279 + 238 + 118 + 144 <b>folios).</b> Three volumes contain the Septuagint, Greek {{version of the}} Old Testament, with {{the complete loss of}} only ten leaves. The fourth volume contains the New Testament with 31 NT leaves lost. In the fourth volume 1 and 2 Clement are also missing leaves, perhaps 3.|$|E

50|$|The prefatory {{material}} includes: Jerome's prologue to the Vulgate {{translation of}} the Bible (<b>folio</b> 1r), the prologue to the Gospel of Matthew (<b>folio</b> 3r), the Genealogy of Jesus from Matthew (<b>folio</b> 4v), a list of interpretations of the Syriac and Hebrew names found in the Gospels (<b>folio</b> 4v), a poem in Irish on the Three Magi (<b>folio</b> 5v), the prologues to the Gospels of Mark (<b>folio</b> 6r), Luke (<b>folio</b> 6v) and John (<b>folio</b> 7v), a prologue to the four Gospels in which the evangelist are compared to other groupings of four such as the four seasons and the four elements, and a poem in Irish on the appearance and manner of death of Christ and the Twelve Apostles (<b>folio</b> 9v).|$|R
5|$|The book's current {{dimensions}} are 330 by 250mm. Originally, the <b>folios</b> were of no standard size, {{but they were}} cropped to the current size during a 19th-century rebinding. The text area is approximately 250 by 170mm. Each text page has 16 to 18 lines of text. The manuscript is in remarkably good condition considering its great age, though many pages have suffered some damage to the delicate artwork due to rubbing. The book {{must have been the}} product of a major scriptorium over several years, yet was apparently never finished, the projected decoration of some pages appearing only in outline. It is believed that some 30 <b>folios</b> of the original manuscript have been lost over the centuries. Ussher counted 344 <b>folios</b> in 1621, but several leaves had already been lost by then. The overall estimate is based on gaps in the text and the absence of certain key illustrations.|$|E
5|$|The <b>folios</b> {{are made}} of vellum {{parchment}} primarily from calf skins, secondarily from sheep skins. (Tischendorf himself thought that the parchment had been made from antelope skins, but modern microscopic examination has shown otherwise.) Most of the quires or signatures contain four sheets, save two containing five. It is estimated that the hides of about 360 animals were employed for making the <b>folios</b> of this codex. As {{for the cost of}} the material, time of scribes and binding, it equals the lifetime wages of one individual at the time.|$|E
5|$|Mario Kleff also {{reproduced}} <b>folios</b> {{from the}} Book of Kells and together with Faksimile-Verlag Publisher Urs Düggelin, curated {{an exhibition of}} the Book of Kells which included these facsimile pages. These facsimiles were created using the original techniques and were also presented in the Diocesan Museum of Trier.|$|E

25|$|The {{actual size}} of a <b>folio</b> book depends {{on the size of}} the full sheet of paper on which it was printed, and in older periods these were not standardized, so the term's meaning is only approximate. Historically, {{printers}} used a range of names such as (with approximate maximum page height): Double Elephant <b>Folio</b> (50 inches, 127cm), Atlas <b>Folio</b> (25 inches, ca 63cm), Elephant <b>Folio</b> (23 inches, ca 58cm), Royal <b>Folio</b> (20 inches, ca 51cm), Medium <b>Folio</b> (18 inches, ca 46cm), and (the most common) Crown <b>Folio</b> (15 inches, ca 38cm).|$|R

5|$|The {{portion of}} the codex held by the British Library {{consists}} of 346½ <b>folios,</b> 694 pages (38.1cm x 34.5cm), constituting {{over half of the}} original work. Of these <b>folios,</b> 199 belong to the Old Testament, including the apocrypha (deuterocanonical), and 147½ belong to the New Testament, along with two other books, the Epistle of Barnabas and part of The Shepherd of Hermas. The apocryphal books present in the surviving part of the Septuagint are 2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, 1 and 4 Maccabees, Wisdom, and Sirach. The books of the New Testament are arranged in this order: the four Gospels, the epistles of Paul (Hebrews follows 2 Thess.), the Acts of the Apostles, the General Epistles, and the Book of Revelation. The fact that some parts of the codex are preserved in good condition while others are in very poor condition implies they were separated and stored in several places.|$|E
5|$|The extant <b>folios</b> of the {{manuscript}} start with the fragment of the glossary of Hebrew names. This fragment occupies the left-hand column of folio 1r. A miniature of the four evangelist symbols, now much abraded, make up the right-hand column. The miniature is oriented so that the volume must be turned ninety degrees to view it properly. The four evangelist symbols are a visual theme that runs throughout the book. They are almost always shown together to emphasise {{the doctrine of the}} four Gospels' unity of message.|$|E
5|$|The {{unity of}} the Gospels is further {{emphasised}} by the decoration of the Eusebian canon tables. The canon tables themselves inherently illustrate the {{unity of the}} Gospels by organising corresponding passages from the Gospels. The Eusebian canon tables normally require twelve pages. In the Book of Kells, the makers of the manuscript planned for twelve pages (<b>folios</b> 1v through 7r) but for unknown reasons, condensed them into ten, leaving <b>folios</b> 6v and 7r blank. This condensation rendered the canon tables unusable. The decoration of the first eight pages of the canon tables is heavily influenced by early Gospel Books from the Mediterranean, where it was traditional to enclose the tables within an arcade (as seen in the London Canon Tables). The Kells manuscript presents this motif in an Insular spirit, where the arcades are not seen as architectural elements but rather become stylised geometric patterns with Insular ornamentation. The four evangelist symbols occupy the spaces under and above the arches. The last two canon tables are presented within a grid. This presentation is limited to Insular manuscripts and was first seen in the Book of Durrow.|$|E

50|$|It {{is written}} in a semi-uncial hand. The {{illumination}} of the manuscript includes 4 portraits of the Evangelists: on <b>folio</b> 1r {{is a picture of}} Matthew, on <b>folio</b> 2r is Mark, on <b>folio</b> 3r is Luke, on <b>folio</b> 4r is John. <b>Folio</b> 5r bears the head-piece in colours on a gold background and a splendid colourful initial, executed with use of gold. The heading, one small capital latter in the text and crosses (instead of punctuation dots) are written in gold. <b>Folio</b> 6r has the initial letter in cinnabar on it.|$|R
5|$|Later {{copies of}} the second state, with minor retouching, were also printed from the plate by Thomas Cotes in 1632, for Robert Allot's Second Folio, a new edition of the {{collected}} plays. It was also reused in later <b>folios,</b> although by then the plate was beginning to wear out and was heavily re-engraved. The original plate was still being used into the 1660s, and then disappears. Already in 1640 William Marshall had copied and adapted the design on a new plate for John Benson's edition of Shakespeare's sonnets. All subsequent engraved reprintings of the portrait were made by later engravers copying the original printed image.|$|E
5|$|Oda {{also made}} constitutions, or rules, for his clergy. His Constitutions of Oda {{are the first}} {{surviving}} constitutions of a 10th-century English ecclesiastical reformer. Oda reworked some statutes from 786 to form his updated code, and one item that was dropped were any clauses dealing with paganism. Other items covered were relations between laymen and the clergy, the duties of bishops, {{the need for the}} laity to make canonical marriages, how to observe fasts, and the need for tithes to be given by the laity. The work is extant in just one surviving manuscript, British Museum Cotton Vespasian A XIV, <b>folios</b> 175v to 177v. This is an 11th-century copy done for Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, {{the book}} has been rebound several times. During an 18th-century rebinding, the pages were rather unsympathetically cropped, with small parts of some {{illustrations}} being lost. The book was also rebound in 1895, but that rebinding broke down quickly. By the late 1920s, several <b>folios</b> had detached completely and were kept separate from the main volume. In 1953, bookbinder Roger Powell rebound the manuscript in four volumes and stretched several pages that had developed bulges. Two volumes can normally be seen displayed at Trinity, one opened at a major decorated page, and one opened to show two text pages with smaller decorations.|$|E

5|$|The First Folio text of 1623 {{was based}} {{primarily}} on Q3, with clarifications and corrections possibly coming from a theatrical prompt book or Q1. Other Folio editions of the play were printed in 1632 (F2), 1664 (F3), and 1685 (F4). Modern versions—that take into account several of the <b>Folios</b> and Quartos—first appeared with Nicholas Rowe's 1709 edition, followed by Alexander Pope's 1723 version. Pope began a tradition of editing the play to add information such as stage directions missing in Q2 by locating them in Q1. This tradition continued late into the Romantic period. Fully annotated editions {{first appeared in the}} Victorian period and continue to be produced today, printing the text of the play with footnotes describing the sources and culture behind the play.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} today comprises 340 <b>folios</b> and, since 1953, {{has been}} bound in four volumes. The leaves are on high-quality calf vellum, and the unprecedentedly elaborate ornamentation that covers them includes ten full-page illustrations and text pages that are vibrant with decorated initials and interlinear miniatures and mark the furthest {{extension of the}} anti-classical and energetic qualities of Insular art. The Insular majuscule script of the text itself {{appears to be the}} work of at least three different scribes. The lettering is in iron gall ink, and the colours used were derived {{from a wide range of}} substances, many of which were imports from distant lands.|$|E
5|$|There is {{only one}} early {{manuscript}} of Y Gododdin, the Book of Aneirin, thought to date from {{the second half of}} the 13th century. The currently accepted view is that this manuscript contains the work of two scribes, usually known as A and B. Scribe A wrote down 88 stanzas of the poem, then left a blank page before writing down four related poems known as Gorchanau. This scribe wrote the material down in Middle Welsh orthography. Scribe B added material later, and apparently had access to an earlier manuscript since the material added by this scribe is in Old Welsh orthography. Scribe B wrote 35 stanzas, some of which are variants of stanzas also given by Scribe A while others are not given by A. The last stanza is incomplete and three <b>folios</b> are missing from the end of the manuscript, so some material may have been lost.|$|E
50|$|The Second <b>Folio</b> is the 1632 {{edition of}} the {{collected}} plays of William Shakespeare. It follows the First <b>Folio</b> of 1623. Much language was updated in the Second <b>Folio</b> and there are almost 1,700 changes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Folio</b> Number: Every page of {{a journal}} is numbered. This number {{is known as a}} <b>folio</b> number.
