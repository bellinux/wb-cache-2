2500|$|The {{performance}} of direct contact heat exchangers operating at typical OTEC boundary conditions {{is important to}} the Claude cycle. Many early Claude cycle designs used a surface condenser since their performance was well understood. However, direct contact condensers offer significant disadvantages. As cold water rises in the intake pipe, the pressure decreases to the point where gas begins to evolve. If a significant amount of gas comes out of solution, placing a gas trap before the direct contact heat exchangers may be justified. Experiments simulating conditions in the warm water intake pipe indicated about 30% of the dissolved gas evolves in the top [...] of the tube. The trade-off between [...] of the seawater and expulsion of non-condensable gases from the condenser is dependent on the <b>gas</b> <b>evolution</b> dynamics, deaerator efficiency, head loss, vent compressor efficiency and parasitic power. Experimental results indicate vertical spout condensers perform some 30% better than falling jet types.|$|E

Here we report the synthesis of novel orthorhombic Na-x[FeTi]O- 4 (x = 1 and 4 / 3) anode materials by a solid-state reaction method and their electrochemical behaviors in sodium-ion batteries. These materials are able to reversibly insert additional Na+ ions and show very good cycling stabilities. In particular, the Na- 4 / 3 [FeTi]O- 4 material can deliver a high reversible capacity of 120 mA h g(- 1) at 0. 1 C, and cyclic voltammetry (CV) investigation proves {{that there is no}} phase transformation during testing cycles.

Iron undergoes spontaneous passivation upon its immersion in the melt and {{the thickness of the}} oxide scales increases with the increase of temperature.

40|$|A thin {{coal seam}} mined as a {{protective}} coal seam above a gas outburst coal seam plays {{a central role}} in decreasing the degree of stress placed on a protected seam, thus increasing gas permeability levels and desorption capacities to dramatically eliminate gas outburst risk for the protected seam. However, when multiple layers of coal seams are present, stress-relieved gas from adjacent coal seams can cause a gas explosion. Thus, the post-drainage of gas from fractured and de-stressed strata should be applied. Comprehensive studies of <b>gas</b> permeability <b>evolution</b> mechanisms and <b>gas</b> seepage rules of protected seams close to protective seams that occur during protective seam mining must be carried out. Based on the case of the LongWall (LW) 23209 working face in the Hancheng coal mine, Shaanxi Province, this paper presents a seepage model developed through the FLAC 3 D software program (version 5. 0, Itasca Consulting Group, Inc., Minneapolis, MI, USA) from which gas flow characteristics can be reflected by changes in rock mass permeability.
