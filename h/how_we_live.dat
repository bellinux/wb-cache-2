500|$|Each {{season of}} The Wire {{introduces}} a different {{institution in the}} city of Baltimore and its relationship to law enforcement, while retaining characters and advancing storylines from previous seasons. The five subjects are, in chronological order: the illegal drug trade, the seaport system, the city government and bureaucracy, education and schools, and the print news media. The large cast consists mainly of actors who are little known for their other roles, as well as numerous real-life Baltimore and Maryland figures in guest and recurring roles. Simon has said that despite its framing as a crime drama, the show is [...] "really about the American city, and about <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> together. It's about how institutions have an effect on individuals. Whether one is a cop, a longshoreman, a drug dealer, a politician, a judge or a lawyer, all are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution to which they are committed." ...|$|E

[...] “New {{technologies}} will change <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> and how we drive our cars, which all will have the beneficial effect of improving the environment,” Bush said. “And in my judgment we need to set aside whether or not greenhouse gases {{have been caused by}} mankind or because of natural effects and focus on the technologies that will enable us to live better lives {{and at the same time}} protect the environment”. Gore responded that [...] "The entire global scientific community has a consensus on the question that human beings are responsible for global warming and he [...] has today again expressed personal doubt that that is true." [...] White House deputy press secretary Dana Perino stated that [...] "The president noted in 2001 the increase in temperatures over the past 100 years and that the increase in greenhouse gases was due to a certain extent to human activity".|$|E

500|$|During the 1999 {{parliamentary}} {{debate on the}} rule of law, Jeyaretnam asserted that detention without trial under the ISA contravened the doctrine as [...] "there {{is no way of}} checking the Minister's decision, who decides to make an order detaining a subject, depriving him of his liberty, completely contrary to the rule of natural justice and the fundamental principle that all men are free". He called for the provisions in the Act permitting such detention to be repealed, saying: [...] "The power is only necessary in emergency times when there is a real threat and so we do not need it any more. Let us for once realise that it is a violation of the Rule of Law. Let us be honest and repeal it." [...] Nominated Member of Parliament Simon Tay expressed the view that [...] "the ISA fulfills the Constitution as an exception. It does not fulfill the concept of the Rule of Law in the sense that there are only very limited grounds on which a court can review the decision of the Minister. It is in that sense a subjective discretion." [...] Nonetheless, he recognized that the ISA remained relevant, for instance, as a tool against people alleged to have engaged in espionage, and thus preventive detention could not be definitively declared right or wrong: [...] "It is a case-by-case decision, because that is <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> our lives in a real society." [...] Responding to Jeyaretnam, Ho Peng Kee noted that the justifications for the ISA had been fully debated in Parliament on previous occasions, and emphasized that there are safeguards in place to tackle the apparent arbitrariness of detentions under the Act, including a review of each detention by an advisory board composed of a Supreme Court judge and two prominent members of the public, and also the President's personal discretion to order a detainee's release in the event that the advisory board and Home Affairs Minister disagreed over the necessity for the detention.|$|E

2500|$|Roh's magic realism also {{influenced}} writers in Hispanic America, {{where it was}} translated as realismo mágico in 1927. Venezuelan writer Arturo Uslar-Pietri, who had known Bontempelli, wrote influential magic realist short stories in the 1930s and 40s {{that focused on the}} mystery and reality of <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>live.</b> Luis Leal attests that Pietri seemed to have been the first to adopt the term realismo mágico in Hispanic America in 1948. There are evidence that Mexican writer Elena Garro used the same term to describe the works of E. T. A. Hoffmann but dismissed her own work {{as a part of the}} genre. French-Russian Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier, who rejected Roh's magic realism as tiresome pretension, developed his related concept lo real maravilloso, or marvelous realism, in 1949. Maggie Ann Bowers writes that marvelous realist literature and art expresses [...] "the seemingly opposed perspectives of a pragmatic, practical and tangible approach to reality and an acceptance of magic and superstition" [...] within an environment of differing cultures.|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} shot and edited in a cinéma vérité style, to look like it was taped with one {{hand-held}} camera, including jump cuts similar to ones found in home movies. T.J. Miller, who plays Hud, has said in various interviews that he taped {{a third of the}} movie and almost half of it made it into the film. Director Matt Reeves described the presentation, [...] "We wanted this to be as if someone found a Handicam, took out the tape {{and put it in the}} player to watch it. What you're watching is a home movie that then turns into something else." [...] Reeves explained that the pedestrians documenting the severed head of the Statue of Liberty with the camera phones was reflective of the contemporary period. According to him: [...] "Cloverfield very much speaks to the fear and anxieties of our time, <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> our lives. Constantly documenting things and putting them up on YouTube, sending people videos through e-mail– we felt it was very applicable to the way people feel now." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the fourth}} series, Miracle Day, Davies secured several popular US {{television}} writers, including Buffy the Vampire Slayer writer Jane Espenson; The X-Files, [...] and Supernatural writer John Shiban; and House writer Doris Egan. Additionally, both Davies and John Fay returned to write episodes. In continuing the series Davies chose to keep Torchwood {{more focused on}} the human condition than its science fiction backdrop. He drew inspiration from Buffy the Vampire Slayer noting that [...] "the best metaphors in Buffy came down to, [...] "What's {{it like to be}} in high school, as a kid?" [...] He felt the fourth series of Torchwood to be [...] "about us and our decisions and our lives, and <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> with each other and how we die with each other." [...] The depiction of human nature in the fourth series led to a sequence which many felt to be evocative of the Holocaust. Jane Espenson noted that as a series Torchwood [...] "is willing to go to horrible places". She stated that in storylining Miracle Day, the writers [...] "didn't want to flinch away from what mankind can do." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} the target audience is extremely fluid: while some of his works are clearly published as children's literature (picture books, cassettes), the distinction between youth, young adult and adult literature is not easily made; traditional story-telling addresses the entire community at once. [...] The interplay of truth and fiction, always difficult concepts, is a recurring theme in Schami's writings. [...] Der ehrliche Lügner opens with the words: [...] "My name is Sadik, but not even that is certain." [...] Elsewhere we are told that the important thing is not whether stories are true, but rather <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> with them (A Handful of Stars). [...] Although elements from fairy-tale worlds may appear in these stories, they are always rooted in daily life. [...] Schami has made a distinction between Illusion and Phantasie (illusion and vision). [...] Illusion is an unachievable dream, distorting the world to something impossible, whereas vision is the imaginative construction of achievable goals; rooted in reality it indicates something which can be striven for, but this reality means also accepting the other possibility, that there may not be a happy ending. [...] Asked by a radio interviewer whether literature is an escape from reality, Schami answers, yes: but one which enables the reader to return to reality better equipped.|$|E
