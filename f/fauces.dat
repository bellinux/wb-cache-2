5|$|This subtype {{makes up}} about 10% {{of all cases}} of aphthous stomatitis. It is termed major aphthous {{ulceration}} (MaAU) or major recurrent aphthous stomatitis (MaRAS). Major aphthous ulcers (major aphthae) are similar to minor aphthous ulcers, but are more than 10mm in diameter and the ulceration is deeper. Because the lesions are larger, healing takes longer (about twenty to thirty days), and may leave scars. Each episode of ulceration usually produces {{a greater number of}} ulcers, and the time between attacks is less than seen in minor aphthous stomatitis. Major aphthous ulceration usually affects non keratinized mucosal surfaces, but less commonly keratinized mucosa may also be involved, such as the dorsum (top surface) of the tongue or the gingiva (gums). The soft palate or the <b>fauces</b> (back of the throat) may also be involved, the latter being part of the oropharynx rather than the oral cavity. Compared to minor aphthous ulceration, major aphthae tend to have an irregular outline.|$|E
2500|$|The {{oropharynx}} {{lies between}} the mouth (oral cavity) to the front, and the laryngopharynx below, which [...] separates {{it from the}} larynx. The upper limit of the oropharynx is marked by the soft palate, and its lower limit by the epiglottis and root of the tongue. The oropharynx communicates with the mouth, in front through {{what is known as}} the oropharyngeal isthmus, or isthmus of the <b>fauces.</b> The isthmus (i.e. connection) is formed above by the soft palate, below by the posterior third of the tongue, and at the sides by the palatoglossal arches. The posterior third of the tongue, or tongue base contains numerous follicles of lymphatic tissue that form the lingual tonsils. Adjacent to the tongue base, the lingual surface of the epiglottis, which curves forward, is attached to the tongue by median and lateral glossoepiglottic folds. The folds form small troughs known as the epiglottic valleculae. The lateral walls are marked by two vertical pillars on each side, the pillars of the <b>fauces,</b> or palatoglossal arches. More properly they are separately named the palatoglossal arch anteriorly and the palatopharyngeal arch posteriorly. The anterior arch is named from the palatoglossal muscle within, running from the soft palate to the tongue [...] (glossus), while the posterior arch similarly contains the palatopharyngeal muscle running from the soft palate to the lateral pharynx. Between the arches lies a triangular space, the tonsillar fossa in which lies the palatine tonsil, another lymphoid organ.|$|E

60|$|At {{the back}} of the peristylium was the oecus, or state apartment, where Caius {{received}} distinguished guests, and where, in the lifetime of Julia, entertainments were given to the ladies of the colony. Like the triclinium, this room was also partially open at both ends, affording the guests a view of the graceful fountain on the one side and of the garden on the other. In winter wooden frames, with heavy hangings, were erected across these openings and that of the tablinum, for the Romans soon found the necessity for modifying the arrangements which, although well suited for an Italian climate, were wholly unfit for that of Britain. The opening in the centre of the atrium was then closed with an awning of oiled canvas, which admitted a certain amount of light to pass, but prevented the passage of rain and snow, and kept out much of the cold. There was a narrow passage between the atrium and the peristylium; this was called the <b>fauces.</b> Above the chambers round the atrium was a second story, approached by a staircase from the peristylium; here were the apartments of the ladies and of the female slaves.|$|E

40|$|In 1919 Dr C. A. BACKER {{collected}} {{a plant in}} the Kangean Archipelago which had {{the appearance of a}} Cymaria so that the collector provisionally called it ”Cymaria triphylla BACKER“ (MS.). The same species was also collected by KARTA on the Island of Bawean in 1928. Some other sheets already extant in the Herbarium at Buitenzorg for a long time among the indeterminate specimens were recognized as identical with this ”Cymaria“ (TEYSMANN nr. 1750, Madoera and nr. 1768, Bawean). In 1937 Dr BACKER, when working up Javanese plants, had a closer examination of this plant and concluded that it could not be inserted in Cymaria, and even not in the Labiatae, but that it had rather to be put into the Verbenaceae. However, he found himself unable to identify the species with the monograph of the Malaysian Verbenaceae (H. J. LAM, The Verbenaceae of the Malayan Archipelago, etc., Groningen 1919), nor in the revision of that family (H. J. LAM & R. C. BAKHUIZEN VAN DEN BRINK, Bull. du Jard. bot. de Buitenz., III, 3, 1921). He therefore kindly put the specimens into our hands for closer examination. Moreover, a part of the alcohol material preserved at Buitenzorg was kindly put at our disposal. The material appeared to represent a hitherto undescribed species of Vitex. We are indebted to Dr BACKER and to Dr D. F. VAN SLOOTEN, Keeper of the Buitenzorg Herbarium, for their kind assistance and their allowance to publish our results in this Journal. Vitex cymarioides H. J. LAM et A. D. J.

60|$|Returning to {{the thread}} of our exposition, we have next to trace, {{throughout}} organic progress, this same all-pervading principle. And here, where {{the evolution of the}} homogeneous into the heterogeneous was first observed, the production of many effects by one cause is least easy to demonstrate. The development of a seed into a plant, or an ovum into an animal, is so gradual, while the forces which determine it are so involved, {{and at the same time}} so unobtrusive, that it is difficult to detect the multiplication of effects which is elsewhere so obvious. But, guided by indirect evidence, we may safely conclude that here too the law holds. Note, first, how numerous are the changes which any marked action works upon an adult organism--a human being, for instance. An alarming sound or sight, besides the impressions on the organs of sense and the nerves, may produce a start, a scream, a distortion of the face, a trembling consequent on general muscular relaxation, a burst of perspiration, a rush of blood to the brain, followed possibly by arrest of the heart's action and by syncope; and if the subject be feeble, an indisposition with its long train of complicated symptoms may set in. Similarly in cases of disease. A minute portion of the small-pox virus introduced into the system, will, in a severe case, cause, during the first stage, rigors, heat of skin, accelerated pulse, furred tongue, loss of appetite, thirst, epigastric uneasiness, vomiting, headache, pains in the back and limbs, muscular weakness, convulsions, delirium, &c.; in the second stage, cutaneous eruption, itching, tingling, sore throat, swelled <b>fauces,</b> salivation, cough, hoarseness, dyspnoea, &c.; and in the third stage, oedematous inflammations, pneumonia, pleurisy, diarrhoea, inflammation of the brain, ophthalmia, erysipelas, &c.: each of which enumerated symptoms is itself more or less complex. Medicines, special foods, better air, might in like manner be instanced as producing multipled results. Now it needs only to consider that the many changes thus wrought by one force upon an adult organism, will be in part paralleled in an embryo organism, to understand how here also, the evolution of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous may be due to the production of many effects by one cause. The external heat, which, falling on a matter having special proclivities, determines the first complications of the germ, may, by acting on these, superinduce further complications; upon these still higher and more numerous ones; and so on continually: each organ as it is developed serving, by its actions and reactions on the rest, to initiate new complexities. The first pulsations of the foetal heart must simultaneously aid the unfolding of every part. The growth of each tissue, by taking from the blood special proportions of elements, must modify the constitution of the blood; and so must modify the nutrition of all the other tissues. The heart's action, implying as it does a certain waste, necessitates an addition to the blood of effete matters, which must influence the rest of the system, and perhaps, as some think, cause the formation of excretory organs. The nervous connexions established among the viscera must further multiply their mutual influences; and so continually. Still stronger becomes the probability of this view when we call to mind the fact, that the same germ may be evolved into different forms according to circumstances. Thus, during its earlier stages, every embryo is sexless--becomes either male or female as the balance of forces acting on it determines. Again, it is a well-established fact that the larva of a working-bee will develop into a queen-bee, if before it is too late, its food be changed to that on which the larvæ of queen-bees are fed. All which instances suggest that the proximate cause of each advance in embryonic complication is the action of incident forces upon the complication previously existing. Indeed, we may find a priori reason to think that the evolution proceeds after this manner. For since no germ, animal or vegetal, contains the slightest rudiment or indication of the future organism--since the microscope has shown us that the first process set up in every fertilized germ, is a process of repeated spontaneous fissions ending in the production of a mass of cells, not one of which exhibits any special character; there seems no alternative but to suppose that the partial organization at any moment existing in a growing embryo, is transformed by the agencies acting upon it into the succeeding phase of organization, and this into the next, until, through ever-increasing complexities, the ultimate form is reached. Not indeed that we can thus really explain the production of any plant or animal. We are still in the dark respecting those mysterious properties in virtue of which the germ, when subject to fit influences, undergoes the special changes that begin the series of transformations. All we aim to show, is, that given a germ possessing those particular proclivities distinguishing the species to which it belongs, and the evolution of an organism from it, probably depends on that multiplication of effects which we have seen to be the cause of progress in general, so far as we have yet traced it.|$|E
6000|$|... [FN#17] About {{the classic}} [...] "Harrah," [...] I shall {{have more to}} say at a future time. The word [...] "Ria" [...] in {{literary}} and in vulgar Arabic is almost synonymous with Akabah, a steep descent, a path between hills or a mountain road. [FN#18] Valleys may be divided into three kinds. 1. Longitudinal, i.e. parallel to the axis of their ridges; 2. Transversal or perpendicular to the same; and, 3. Diagonal, which form an acute or an obtuse angle with the main chain of mountains. [FN#19] This act, by the bye, I afterwards learned to be a greater act of imprudence than the sleeping alone. Nothing renders the Arab thief so active as the chance of stealing a good weapon. [FN#20] Probably, because water is usually found in such places. In the wild parts of the country, wells are generally protected by some fortified building, for men consider themselves safe from an enemy until their supply of water is cut off. [FN#22] Near Al-Hamra, {{at the base of}} the Southern hills, within fire of the forts, there is a fine spring of sweet water. All such fountains are much prized by the people, who call them [...] "Rock-water," [...] and attribute to them tonic and digestive virtues. [FN#23] As far as I could discover, the reason of the ruinous state of the country at present is the effect of the old Wahhabi and Egyptian wars in the early part of the present century, and the misrule of the Turks. In Arabia the depopulation of a village or a district is not to be remedied, as in other countries, by an influx of strangers; the land still belongs to the survivors of the tribe, and trespass would be visited with a bloody revenge. [FN#24] Without these forts the Turks, at least so said my companions, could never hold the country against the Badawin. There is a little amour propre in the assertion, but upon the whole it is true. There are no Mohammed Alis, Jazzars, and Ibrahim Pachas in these days. [FN#25] To [...] "halal" [...] is to kill an animal according to Moslem rites: a word is wanted to express the act, and we cannot do better than to borrow it from the people to whom the practice belongs. [FN#26] He is now dead, and has been succeeded by a son worse than himself. [FN#27] The greatest of all its errors was that of appointing to the provinces, instead of the single Pasha of the olden time, three different governors, civil, military, and fiscal, all depending upon the supreme council at Constantinople. Thus each province has three plunderers instead of one, and its affairs are referred to a body that can take no interest in it. [FN#28] Ziyad bin Abihi was sent by Al-Mu'awiyah, the Caliph, to reform Al-Basrah, a den of thieves; he made a speech, noticed that he meant to rule with the sword, and advised all offenders to leave the city. The inhabitants were forbidden under pain of death to appear in the streets after evening prayers, and dispositions were made to secure the execution of the penalty. Two hundred persons were put to death by the patrol during the first night, only five during the second, and not a drop of blood was shed afterwards. By similar severity, the French put an end to assassination at Naples, and the Austrians at Leghorn. We may deplore the necessity of having recourse to such means, but it is a silly practice to salve the wound which requires the knife. [FN#29] These remarks were written in 1853: I see no reason to change them in 1878. [FN#30] A weak monarch, a degenerate government, a state whose corruption is evidenced by moral decay, a revenue bolstered up by a system of treasury paper, which even the public offices discount at from three to six per cent., an army accustomed to be beaten, and disorganised provinces; these, together with the proceedings of a ruthless and advancing enemy, form the points of comparison between the Constantinople of the present day and the Byzantine metropolis eight hundred years ago. Fate has marked upon the Ottoman Empire in Europe [...] "delenda est": we are now witnessing the efforts of human energy and ingenuity to avert or to evade the fiat. [FN#31] When water cannot be obtained for ablution before prayers, Moslems clap the palms of their hands upon the sand, and draw them down the face and both fore-arms. This operation, which is performed once or twice-it varies in different schools-is called Tayammum. [FN#32] I write this word as my companions pronounced it. Burckhardt similarly gives it [...] "Djedeyde," [...] and Ali Bey [...] "Djideïda." [...] Giovanni Finati wrongly calls the place [...] "Jedeed Bughaz," [...] which Mr. Bankes, his editor, rightly translates the [...] "new opening or pass." [...] [FN#33] Al-Khayf is a common name for places in this part of Arabia. The word literally means a declivity or a place built upon a declivity. [FN#34] Bughaz means in Turkish the <b>fauces,</b> the throat, and signifies also here a gorge, or a mountain pass. It is the word now commonly used in Al-Hijaz for the classical [...] "Nakb," [...] or [...] "Mazik." [...] Vincent (Periplus) errs in deriving the word from the Italian [...] "Bocca." [...] [FN#35] Giovanni Finati, who was present at this hard-fought field as a soldier in Tussun's army, gives a lively description of the disastrous [...] "day of Jadaydah" [...] in vol. i. of his work. [FN#36] This Abdullah, Pasha of Damascus, led the caravan in A.D. 1756. When the Shaykhs of the Harb tribe came to receive their black-mail, he cut off their heads, and sent the trophies to Stambul. During the next season the Harb were paralysed by the blow, but in the third year they levied 80,000 men, attacked the caravan, pillaged it, and slew every Turk that fell into their hands.|$|E

50|$|The {{clinical}} features are dysphonia (paralysis of the vocal cords) and anesthesia of the larynx; dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing solids caused by paralysis {{of the superior}} constriction of the pharynx); paralysis of soft palate and <b>fauces</b> with anesthesia of these parts and of the pharynx; loss of taste in the posterior third of the tongue and tongue deviation to affected side; weakness of sternocleidomastoid (caused by paralysis of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius), Horner’s syndrome (due to paralysis of the cervical sympathetic nerves), ipsilateral lower motor neurone facial weakness. The investigation of choice is imaging of retropharyngeal space with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), specifically looking for tumour or infection.|$|E
50|$|In {{its passage}} through the foramen (with X and XI), the {{glossopharyngeal}} nerve passes between the internal jugular vein and internal carotid artery. It descends {{in front of the}} latter vessel and beneath the styloid process and the muscles connected with it, to the lower border of the stylopharyngeus. It then curves forward, forming an arch {{on the side of the}} neck and lying upon the stylopharyngeus and middle pharyngeal constrictor muscle. From there, it passes under cover of the hyoglossus muscle and is finally distributed to the palatine tonsil, the mucous membrane of the <b>fauces</b> and base of the tongue, and the serous glands of the mouth.|$|E
5000|$|In {{vertebrate}} anatomy, {{the throat}} (gula) is the anterior {{part of the}} neck, positioned {{in front of the}} vertebra. It contains the pharynx and larynx. An important section of it is the epiglottis, which is a flap separating the esophagus from the trachea (windpipe) preventing food and drink being inhaled into the lungs. The throat contains various blood vessels, pharyngeal muscles, the nasopharyngeal tonsil, the tonsils, the palatine uvula, the trachea, the esophagus, and the vocal cords. Mammal throats consist of two bones, the hyoid bone and the clavicle. The [...] "throat" [...] is sometimes thought to be synonymous for the isthmus of the <b>fauces.</b>|$|E
50|$|The roof of {{the mouth}} is termed the palate and it {{separates}} the oral cavity from the nasal cavity. The palate is hard {{at the front of}} the mouth since the overlying mucosa is covering a plate of bone; it is softer and more pliable at the back being made of muscle and connective tissue, and it can move to swallow food and liquids. The soft palate ends at the uvula. The surface of the hard palate allows for the pressure needed in eating food, to leave the nasal passage clear. The lips are the mouth's front boundary and the <b>fauces</b> (the passageway between the tonsils, also called the throat), mark its posterior boundary.|$|E
5000|$|... === Mouth cavity === [...] The mouth, {{consists}} of 2 regions, the vestibule and the oral cavity proper. The vestibule {{is the area}} between the teeth, lips and cheeks. The oral cavity is bounded at the sides and in front by the alveolar process (containing the teeth) and at the back by the isthmus of the <b>fauces.</b> Its roof is formed by hard palate and soft palate and the floor is formed by the mylohyoid muscles and is occupied mainly by the tongue. A mucous membrane - the oral mucosa, lines the sides and under surface of the tongue to the gums, lining the inner aspect of the jawbone (mandible). It receives the secretions from the submaxillary and sublingual salivary glands.|$|E
50|$|In 1795 Pearson {{published}} A Short Account of the Nature and Properties {{of different}} kinds of Airs so far as relates to their Medicinal Use, intended as an introduction to the Pneumatic Way of Treating Diseases, and in 1798 The Arguments in Favour of an Inflammatory Diathesis in Hydrophobia considered, in which he combats the then prevalent opinion of John Ferriar of Manchester that general inflammation and inflammation of the <b>fauces</b> were the chief pathological conditions in hydrophobia. Pearson expressed the opinion that the case of Dr. Christopher Nugent (died 1775) was one of hysteria, and recommended the omission of bleeding in such cases, the administration of wine, and the application of caustics in regions distant from the bite. In 1799 he published Observations on the Bilious Fever of 1797, 1798, and 1799.|$|E
5000|$|The {{height of}} the shell attains 14 mm, its {{diameter}} 14½ mm. The umbilicate shell has a conoidal shape. It is granulate-cingulate with the cinguli unequally elevated. The smaller ones are interpolated, numbering 5 to 6 between suture and the periphery, 7 to 8 {{on the base of}} the body whorl obtusely angulated. The granules are rosy-red colered with white subalternating. The suture is moderate. The very oblique aperture is subquadrangular. Its <b>fauces</b> is sulcate, corresponding to the ridges of the exterior. The outer margin is obtuse and subcrenulated. The basal margin is plicatulate. The columella is disjoined and prominently denticulate above, oblique, with 1 or 2 tubercles where it joins the basal margin. The white umbilicus is narrow. Its margin is not crenate, with an elevated fold within the periphery.|$|E
