5|$|Michael (Tony Gardner) {{owns and}} runs the café that Rick and Marty {{frequently}} visit {{to escape the}} chaos of Rick's home. He is socially awkward, possibly {{to the extent of}} having a mental disorder, although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> a high-flying city banker who suffered from burn-out. His father turns out to be gay in later series, to which Michael reacts negatively.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor {{made two}} {{arguments}} for the dissenting justices: that predisposition was proven {{by the fact}} that Jacobson had ordered materials both times <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> solicited, and that the Court had usurped the jury's rightful role in deciding whether he was entrapped. She also expressed fears that the court had so broadened the definition of predisposition as to make it a viable defense in almost any case.|$|E
5|$|The 19th century {{historian}} W. F. Skene {{named the}} clan {{as one of}} the seven clans of Siol Alpinwho according to Skene could all trace their ancestry back to Alpin, father of Cináed mac Ailpín. Popular tradition has been until recently to consider Cináed mac Ailpín the first King of Scots and a Gael; however, recent research has shown <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> a Pictish king and likely a Pict himself.|$|E

5|$|There {{seems to}} only be one known example of extreme marital strife in Tolkien's mythology, that of Eöl and Aredhel, {{in which the}} latter {{actually}} left the former without his knowledge, resulting in Eöl ultimately killing her (albeit <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> trying to kill their son Maeglin). However, this marriage was far from typical of the Elves.|$|E
5|$|A young {{officer in}} the 4th Dragoons, Lieutenant William Light who later served on Graham's staff and was a great admirer of the general, {{subsequently}} became the Surveyor General of South Australia in the 1830s. Light decided to name one of the valleys in the new colony Barossa Valley (now a famous wine making region) {{in memory of the}} victory, albeit misspelled due to a clerical error. It is often incorrectly stated that Light fought at the Battle of Barrosa but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> hundreds of miles to the north, his diary of 6 March 1811 recording he was with Wellington's cavalry travelling through Santarem to Pernes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many sources}} have {{identified}} him as {{a native of the}} rural town of Bisacquino, where he was raised, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> born in the city of Palermo. His parents, Accursio Cascioferro and Santa Ippolito, were poor and illiterate. The family moved to Bisacquino when his father became a campiere (an armed guard) with the local landlord, Baron Antonino Inglese, a notorious usurper of state-owned land. The position of campiere often involved Mafiosi. According to other sources, at an early age, the family moved to Sambuca Zabut, where he lived for approximately 24 years before relocating to Bisacquino, his recognized power base in the Mafia.|$|E

It is later revealed that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> a member of the Inukai household, who would have been the Inukai Guardian, however his mother hid his existence.|$|R

5|$|Captain Renaudin {{was said}} in a naval {{registry}} to have swum to safety. He had in fact abandoned his ship with the first British boat, leaving his men behind in disregard for military customs and the 1765 standing order that Captains had to be last to abandon ship, and though his account insinuates {{that he was on}} a boat close to Vengeur when she foundered, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> dining in the mess of Culloden at the moment of the sinking. In 1795, Loutherbourg depicted the rescue of Vengeurs crew by British ships in his large canvas of the battle, Lord Howe's action, or the Glorious First of June.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Worsley found {{a command}} in the Merchant Navy, and, giving his age as 64 (<b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> 69), was {{appointed}} {{master of the}} Dalriada in August 1941. He worked to keep the harbour entrance at Sheerness clear of wrecked shipping and also carried out salvage work. His command was {{only for a few}} months for when the company that owned his vessel found out his true age, he was replaced. Unhappy at being put into the Merchant Navy Reserve Pool, he continued to advocate for a useful posting.|$|E
5|$|In a March 2007 segment about {{finances}} and lifestyles of televangelists, 20/20 aired {{a clip of}} Apostle Frederick K. C. Price, a TV minister, that was originally broadcast by the Lifetime Network in 1997. Price alleged that the clip portrayed him describing his wealth in extravagant terms, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> telling a parable about a rich man. ABC News twice aired a retraction and apologized for the error. The suit concluded with an out of court settlement including a public apology by ABC.|$|E

5|$|In early April 1941, Hitler {{had agreed}} to the {{creation}} of the SS-Freiwilligenstandarte Nordwest (SS Volunteer Regiment Northwest), with an authorised strength of 2,500 men recruited from Flanders and the Netherlands. This formation capitalised on the push for an autonomous Flemish-Dutch region within the Reich. Significant proponents of such a union were Anton Mussert of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands and Staf De Clercq of the Flemish National League. In this, Berger was exploiting Mussert and De Clerq, because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> working towards Hitler's idea of incorporating Flanders and Wallonia into the Reich as two Gaue, not a unified autonomous entity.|$|E
5|$|On 29 January, General Nguyễn Khánh ousted Minh's MRC in a bloodless pre-dawn coup; {{although}} Khánh {{accused the}} junta of intending {{to make a}} deal with the communists and claimed to have proof, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> motivated by personal ambition. After Khánh was deposed a year later, he admitted that the allegations against Minh's group were false. In later years, Khánh, Thơ and Minh's generals all agreed that the coup was strongly encouraged by the Americans and could not have occurred without their backing.|$|E
5|$|The {{biography}} of Geta states {{he was born}} at Mediolanum on 27 May; the year is not specified but it was 'in the suffect consulships of Severus and Vitellius'. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> born at Rome on 7 March 189; {{there was no such}} pair of suffect consuls in this or any other year; however, {{it has been suggested that}} the names for these persons be amended to be Severus and Vettulenus, and that these men were suffect consuls sometime before 192.|$|E

5|$|While still afoot, Ross {{and his men}} {{participated in}} the Battle of Corinth. Under Ross's command, his Texans twice {{captured}} Union guns at Battery Robinett. They were forced to retreat from their position each time as reinforcements failed to arrive. During the battle, Ross, who had acquired a horse, was bucked off, leading his men to believe he had been killed. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> unharmed. The Confederate Army retreated from the battle and found themselves facing more Union troops at Hatchie's Bridge. Ross led 700 riflemen to engage the Union troops. For three hours, his men held off 7,000 Union troops, repulsing three major enemy assaults.|$|E
5|$|As the {{simulation}} begins to weaken under the Saints' influence, Zinyak floods virtual Steelport with copies of gang members the Boss has faced in the past. Kinzie determines that the copies {{are being made}} from someone's memory, leading the Boss to conclude Johnny Gat, who was seemingly killed during the events of Saints Row: The Third, is still alive and trapped within {{the simulation}}. Despite protests from Kinzie and Matt that rescuing Johnny will reveal their location to Zinyak, the Boss rescues Johnny from his nightmare of Aisha's death and gets {{him back to the}} ship. Johnny explains that during the fight in which he was presumed killed, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> abducted by Zinyak years in advance of their invasion, as Zinyak had concluded that Johnny could have single-handedly stopped him if left on Earth.|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} round of pit stops, Hamilton had a lead of nearly 20seconds over Massa, and fuelled longer than all the other drivers in the points-scoring {{positions}} when he pitted on lap18. Coming out of the pits, Hamilton made an error and was passed by Trulli. The two drivers then nearly collided at the hairpin, with Hamilton holding back {{for the rest of the}} lap waiting for Trulli to pit. Trulli's teammate Glock stayed out on the track longer than all of the other drivers except Barrichello and Piquet, meaning that when he pitted, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> in third position and rejoined the race in eighth. Hamilton regained the lead by lap22 after Massa, Kovalainen, Trulli and Räikkönen made their pit stops, and had in the region of an 11second lead over Massa at the half-way stage of the race. Behind the leaders, fourth-placed Kubica was beginning to catch Kovalainen in third, while Trulli, Räikkönen, Alonso and Vettel battled over the final four point-scoring places.|$|E

5|$|Bede, who is {{the main}} source for this information, is unclear on his {{chronology}} relating to Wighard. At {{one point in the}} Historia Ecclesiastica, he states that Canterbury had been vacant for some time before Wighard's election, but in other writings he implies that Wighard was appointed soon after the conclusion of the Council of Whitby, which likely took place in 664. However Wighard was selected, he died in Rome. His death possibly occurred around 664, but could have been as late as 667. It may have been caused by the bubonic plague, or perhaps was due to some other disease epidemic. Like much else in his life, it is unclear if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> consecrated before his death. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for Wighard states that he died before consecration. The historian Peter Blair, however, states that Wighard died {{as he was about to}} head home to Canterbury, after his consecration.|$|E
5|$|Crosby {{was born}} in the Grace Maternity Hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on August 7, 1987, to Troy and Trina (née Forbes) Crosby. Crosby's jersey number (87) and 2007 {{contract}} signing ($8.7million per year) reflect his birthdate (8/7/87). Crosby grew up in nearby Cole Harbour, and has a younger sister, Taylor. His father was a goaltender who played for the Verdun Junior Canadiens in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). Troy played in the 1985 Memorial Cup and had been drafted 240th overall by the Montreal Canadiens in 1984, but never played at the NHL level. Growing up, Crosby admired Steve Yzerman and, like his father, was a Canadiens fan. Crosby began playing hockey by himself in his basement at the age of two years, shooting pucks in a net that had the family dryer behind it, leading to a longstanding misconception that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> practising with the dryer; he learned to skate at three.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 2009, Tonight Show host Conan O'Brien engaged in a satirical on-air and YouTube feud with Booker, with O'Brien jokingly {{insulting}} the City of Newark and Booker responding that he would ban O'Brien from the Newark airport. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for the feud to end during a prepared comedy bit, telling Booker to {{chalk it up to}} a head injury suffered by O'Brien less than two weeks earlier. Booker then appeared on O'Brien's show and assured viewers that the feud was over and that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> a big fan of O'Brien, who agreed that every time he made a joke about Newark, he would donate $500 to the City of Newark, and also made a $50,000 donation to the Newark Now charity, which was matched by NBC Universal.|$|E
