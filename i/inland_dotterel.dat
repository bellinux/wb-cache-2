5000|$|Charadrius australis, the <b>Inland</b> <b>Dotterel</b> or Australian Dotterel, a {{medium-sized}} plover species found in Australia ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>inland</b> <b>dotterel</b> {{is one of}} over 60 shorebird {{species in}} the family Charadriidae, {{although}} it is rarely seen near water. Its taxonomic position continues to cause debate. The initial scientific name Eudromias australis supposed a generic relationship to the Eurasian dotterel (E. morinellus) that does not exist. Some modern authors place it in Charadrius, most {{closely related to the}} oriental plover (C. veredus) on mtDNA and protein allozyme evidence. Most authorities currently recognize the monotypic genera Peltohyas for the <b>inland</b> <b>dotterel.</b> Baker supported Peltohyas and placed the <b>inland</b> <b>dotterel</b> in a clade with other Australasian endemic genera (which also coincidentally consist a single species) the red-kneed dotterel (Erythrogons cinctus) and the wrybill (Anaryhnchus frontalis) of New Zealand. The Australian ornithologist Gregory M. Mathews proposed the subspecies C. australis whitlocki for birds in western Australia based on supposedly darker plumage, but the validity of this has been disputed.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The bird area {{surrounding}} the lagoon {{is an important}} site for <b>inland</b> <b>dotterels</b> ...|$|R
50|$|As well as plains-wanderers, {{significant}} bird {{populations in}} the IBA include chirruping wedgebills, cinnamon quail-thrushes, <b>inland</b> <b>dotterels,</b> redthroats and slender-billed thornbills.|$|R
50|$|In the <b>inland</b> <b>dotterel's</b> sparse desert habitat {{there are}} few {{significant}} threats. Foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have been observed predating eggs and young. Black falcon (Falco subniger) and nankeen kestrel (Falco cenchroides) have been observed attacking adults.|$|R
50|$|They are {{distributed}} through open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water, {{although there are}} some exceptions: the <b>inland</b> <b>dotterel,</b> for example, prefers stony ground in the deserts of central and western Australia.|$|E
50|$|The <b>inland</b> <b>dotterel</b> occurs {{widely in}} the arid {{south-east}} and south-west of Australia. Its distribution corresponds to areas below the 100mm summer rainfall isohyet. It {{can be found}} in suitable habitat within this range in all the mainland states.|$|E
50|$|Bulgunnia {{has been}} {{classified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area {{because it is}} a stronghold for the restricted-range and near-threatened chestnut-breasted whiteface as well as supporting the biome-restricted <b>inland</b> <b>dotterel,</b> Bourke's parrot, chiming wedgebill, cinnamon quail-thrush, pied honeyeater and thick-billed grasswren.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an IBA because it contains the largest known population of the chestnut-breasted whitefaces within {{the eastern part of}} its range. It also supports populations of <b>inland</b> <b>dotterels,</b> thick-billed grasswrens, banded whitefaces, black and pied honeyeaters, gibberbirds, chirruping wedgebills and cinnamon quail-thrushes.|$|R
50|$|The Important Bird Area (IBA) {{has been}} {{identified}} as such by BirdLife International because it supports a large population of Eyrean grasswrens as well as small numbers of plains-wanderers. It also contains good numbers of grey falcons, Australian bustards, <b>inland</b> <b>dotterels,</b> banded whitefaces, grey-headed, grey, black and pied honeyeaters, gibberbirds, chirruping and chiming wedgebills, cinnamon quail-thrushes and painted finches.|$|R
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because, when conditions are suitable, it supports up to 400,000 waterbirds with over 1% of the world populations of black swans, freckled and pink-eared ducks, grey teals, Australasian shovelers, hardheads, red-necked avocets, white-headed and banded stilts, sharp-tailed sandpipers and red-capped plovers. [...] It supports regionally significant numbers of Australian pelicans, Eurasian coots and whiskered terns. [...] It also holds populations of <b>inland</b> <b>dotterels,</b> Caspian terns, Bourke's parrots, grey-headed, black and pied honeyeaters, slaty-backed thornbills, Hall's babblers, chirruping wedgebills and chestnut-breasted quail-thrushes.|$|R
50|$|The <b>inland</b> <b>dotterel</b> is a {{medium-sized}} plover with a distinctive cryptic plumage. Males and females are similarly sized: 19-23 cm (7.5-9.1 in) in length, a wingspan of 43-47 cm (17-19 in) a weight of 80-90 g (2.8-3.2 oz), {{and a short}} bill 1.7 cm (0.7 in).|$|E
50|$|The <b>inland</b> <b>dotterel</b> {{was first}} {{documented}} in 1840 after Captain Charles Sturt collected an immature bird {{on one of}} his expeditions to the Australian interior and sent it to John Gould. Gould initially named it Eudromias australis (from the Greek eu, good, and dromos, runner, and australis, of the southern continent).|$|E
50|$|A 552 km2 part of Granite Downs {{has been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports a population of the near threatened chestnut-breasted whiteface at its north-western distribution limit. It also supports populations of the <b>inland</b> <b>dotterel,</b> Bourke's parrot, banded whiteface, black honeyeater, pied honeyeater, cinnamon quail-thrush, chiming wedgebill and thick-billed grasswren.|$|E
50|$|<b>Inland</b> <b>dotterels</b> prefer sparsely vegetated habitat {{with low}} cover of 200-400 mm (8-16 in.) saltbush, bluebush or {{samphire}} to provide food and shelter. It {{is most often}} seen in gibber plains, clay pans and gravel flats. It {{is believed to have}} benefited from land clearance for agriculture after European settlement. Movements are not well known - there appear to be seasonal movements south in the spring and north in the summer {{and there seems to be}} some movement beyond its normal range when excessive rains or severe drought makes habitat unsuitable. Vagrant birds have been observed as far as Sydney, NSW.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Inland</b> <b>dotterels</b> form monogamous pairs when breeding, {{and both}} birds {{care for the}} young. May breed solitarily or in small colonies of up to six nests. Believed to breed {{at any time of}} the year if {{conditions}} are suitable, but generally breeding not well known, much data restricted to captive pairs. [...] The nest is a shallow depression in bare ground, formed by the birds or taking advantage of a suitable natural depression. A clutch of three eggs is laid. The eggs are oval medium brown coloured with an irregular pattern of dark brown blotches, 3.7 cm x 2.7 cm.|$|R
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it contains most of the habitat suitable for plains-wanderers in the Riverina. [...] It also has good populations of other grassland birds, including brown songlarks, Australasian pipits, banded lapwings and singing bushlarks, {{as well as the}} arid biome restricted <b>inland</b> <b>dotterel.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 3400 km2 {{floodplain}} of {{the lower}} reaches of the Diamantina {{has been identified as}} an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it has been estimated to support at least 450,000 waterbirds when in flood, as well as globally significant numbers of the nankeen night-heron, royal spoonbill, little curlew, Australian bustard, grey grasswren, <b>inland</b> <b>dotterel,</b> cinnamon quail-thrush and pied honeyeater.|$|E
50|$|A 318 km2 area of {{the lake}} and its {{surrounds}} has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it has supported over 1% of the world populations of blue-billed ducks and red-necked avocets as well as populations of the biome-restricted <b>inland</b> <b>dotterel,</b> Bourke's parrot, slaty-backed thornbill, grey-headed honeyeater, black honeyeater, pied honeyeater, Hall's babbler, chirruping wedgebill and chestnut-breasted quail-thrush.|$|E
50|$|During {{the day the}} fleshy tips {{of desert}} shrubs are eaten. <b>Inland</b> <b>dotterel</b> have supraorbital salt glands, and it is thought these glands enable them to remove the salt content of the plants and hence use {{herbivory}} to source water. They have occasionally been observed drinking with large flocks gathering at stock tanks and clay-pans. At night the diet is insectivorous and spiders, grasshoppers, beetles, ants and earwigs have been recorded in gut contents.|$|E
50|$|With Astrebla Downs National Park, Diamantina National Park forms {{part of the}} 7627 km2 Diamantina and Astrebla Grasslands Important Bird Area, {{identified}} by BirdLife International as such because {{it is one of}} few sites known for the critically endangered night parrot. It also supports globally important populations of the plains-wanderer, Australian bustard, straw-necked ibis, white-necked heron, <b>inland</b> <b>dotterel,</b> Bourke's parrot, black and pied honeyeaters, gibberbird, Hall's babbler, chestnut-breasted quail-thrush, cinnamon quail-thrush and spinifexbird.|$|E
50|$|The <b>inland</b> <b>dotterel</b> (Peltohyas australis) is an endemic shorebird of {{the arid}} Australian interior. It forms loose flocks in sparsely vegetated gibber plain and claypans {{in the day}} where it loafs in the shade and eats shoots of shrubs. It is most often {{encountered}} at night when it forages on roads for insects. The relative remoteness of its habitat means {{that it is not}} well studied. The most detailed observations of the species were made by the South African arid-zone ornithology specialist Gordon Maclean in the 1970s. Alternate English names include Australian plover, inland plover, desert plover and prairie plover.|$|E
50|$|Goyder Lagoon {{is located}} within {{an area of}} 2684 km2 which has been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) principally because, when flooded, it supports large numbers of waterbirds, {{with a total of}} 170,000 estimated from aerial surveys in 2002. The IBA supports over 1% of the world populations of freckled ducks, gull-billed terns and breeding royal spoonbills. A small population of yellow chats occurs at the Koonchera waterhole. Other bird species for which the site is important include the letter-winged kite, <b>inland</b> <b>dotterel,</b> grey and Eyrean grasswrens, black and pied honeyeaters, gibberbird, banded whiteface, chirruping wedgebill and cinnamon quail-thrush. In particular, the lagoon is reported as being the site of the largest waterbird aggregations which are found on its southern side including several species of cormorants, ducks, herons and ibises.|$|E
5000|$|Today, {{it is said}} to have a {{resident}} population of four, and is essentially a ghost town. The town was effectively closed in 1997 when the railways were privatised and the new owners did not need a support town there, although the diesel refuelling facilities remain, and there is overnight accommodation for train drivers. Cook is the only scheduled stop on the Nullarbor Plain for the Indian Pacific passenger train across Australia and has little other than curiosity value for the passengers. The bush hospital is closed, but the town maintains some medical supplies {{in the event of a}} train disaster. The hospital advertised itself at the station with the catch cry [...] "If you're crook come to Cook". The shop is only opened while the Indian Pacific is in town. It has a few houses and fuel tanks for the locomotives. The crossing loop can cross trains up to 1800 m long. The former airstrip is known as a place to spot <b>inland</b> <b>dotterel.</b>|$|E
