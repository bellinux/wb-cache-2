40|$|By {{measuring}} {{intentions to}} purchase, this research gives insight into environmental attitudes, pressures to purchase <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> apparel, factors that inhibit <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> apparel purchasing, awareness of <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> apparel purchase options, and marketing {{insight into the}} eco-friendly consumer. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) {{was used to assess}} consumer purchasing intentions for <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> apparel. The TPB consists of a three-pronged measurement: individual attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Individual attitudes were gauged on three dimensions which included environmental attitudes, demographic patterns, and <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> apparel purchase intentions. Subjective norms involve social pressure to engage in eco-friendly behavior, perceived individual environmental impact, and desire for uniqueness in dress. Finally, perceived behavioral control was studied through previous <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> apparel purchases, accessibility of <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> apparel purchase options, and cost of <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> apparel. The results revealed that individual environmental attitudes, social pressure to behave <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly,</b> perceived individual environmental impact, desire for uniqueness in dress, past <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> apparel purchases, accessibility of <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> apparel purchase options, and cost of <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> apparel all have an impact on intentions to purchase <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> apparel. The variable with the strongest relationship to intentions was social pressure. A demographic profile of intent to purchase <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> apparel, however, was not possible with this sample. This indicates there is not specifically one type of person who purchases <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> apparel...|$|R
30|$|Assumption 4 roughly {{means that}} {{productivity}} of an <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> disposal process increases as {{the proportion of}} an activity level of the second process {{to that of the}} third process increases, since positive effects from an <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> production process to an <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> disposal process increase. This assumption coupled with Assumption 2 means that there are positive interactive effects between <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> production and disposal processes.|$|R
30|$|The {{coefficients}} of inputs {{of the second}} process may also depend upon parameter β: There is a route of positive effects from an <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> disposal process to an <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> production process. For instance, as {{the share of the}} <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> disposal process increases and accordingly β increases, there is more positive feedback of the information to the <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> production process (the second process), say, on how to dismantle and treat ELPs properly. It is also possible that the level of collaboration between two actors increases. Then, the possibility for improvement of the production design becomes greater, since this information contributes to kaizen or improvement. In this way, <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> waste disposal affects an <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> production process in an advantageous manner.|$|R

30|$|The former part of Assumption 2 roughly {{means that}} {{productivity}} of an <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> production process increases as {{the proportion of}} an activity level of the fourth process {{to that of the}} fifth process increases, since positive effects from an <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> disposal process to an <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> production process increase. Also, the amount of waste per consumption of an <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> commodity decreases, since DfE is promoted by an increase in β: This is the latter part of Assumption 2.|$|R
40|$|Many {{people are}} {{reluctant}} to behave in <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> ways. One possible explanation might be that the motivation to behave in <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> ways is undermined by the way scientific progress is overstated in the popular media. Four experiments show that portraying science as rapidly progressing—and thus enabling society to control problems related to the natural environment and human health in the not-too-distant future—is detrimental to <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> behaviour because such a frame affirms perceptions of an orderly (vs chaotic) world. This in turn negatively affects the likelihood of engaging in <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> behaviour. Simultaneously, communication that questions (vs affirms) scientific progress leads to lower perceptions of order and consequential increases in <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> behaviour. These findings show that when {{the aim is to}} promote <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> attitudes and behaviour, it helps to not overstate scientific progress...|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, as the {{activity}} level of an <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> disposal process increases, {{there is more}} feedback {{of information on the}} proper treatment of waste from an <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> disposal process to an <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> production process, so that there is an improvement of production in the process. Surely, more information on how one can properly dismantle and treat waste contributes to the enhancement of DfE. This also implies that coefficients of the production process improve, as the proportion of an <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> disposal process to an environmentally unfriendly disposal process increases.|$|R

40|$|Experts {{dealing with}} <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> {{consumer}} behavior can often meet {{the problem of}} the existing gap between positive environmental attitude and green behavior. Despite of the very intensive communication campaigns in connection with environmental problems there are still only a few consumers who consciously put this view into practice. One of the main aims of this empirical study conducted in September 2007 was to identify those psychographic factors, which differentiate persons alongside their <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> behavior the most. Perceived consumer effectiveness and perceived inconvenience of <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> behavior were those factors, which play significant role in differentiation of green consumers from the others. <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> behavior, psychographic variables (environmental knowledge, ecological world-view, perceived consumer effectiveness, perceived inconvenience of <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> behavior, perceived seriousness of ecological problems), discriminant analysis...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{policies}} are {{often based on}} the assumption that people only act <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> if some extrinsic reward is implicated, usually money(1, 2). We argue that people might also be motivated by intrinsic rewards: doing the right thing (such as acting <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly)</b> elicits psychological rewards in the form of positive feelings, a phenomenon known as warm glow(3, 4). Given the fact that people's psychological state may affect their thermal state(5, 6), we expected that this warm glow could express itself quite literally: people who act <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> may perceive the temperature to be higher. In two studies, we found that people who learned they acted <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> perceived a higher temperature than people who learned they acted environmentally unfriendly. The underlying psychological mechanism pertains to the self-concept: learning you acted <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> signals to yourself that you are a good person. Together, our studies show that acting <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> can be psychologically rewarding, suggesting that appealing to intrinsic rewards can be an alternative way to encourage pro-environmental actions...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{qualitative}} research and semi-structured interviews {{this study aims}} to describe what motivates green buying behaviour. During {{the last few decades}} consumers have increasingly started to adopt a more <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> and sustainable buying bahaviour. Consumers buying behaviour was previously based on cultural, social, personal and psychological factors, but recently it has changed, there is now a demand for products and services that not only satisfy the customer's immediate needs, but also has a positive impact on the environment. There is no consensus in the current situation around what motivates <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> purchasing behavior, previous research highlights factors such as price and quality, emotion, culture and morality. Other research claims that functionality, social factors, temporary factors and knowledge motivates <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> purchasing behavior, which in turn justifies further studies on the subject. This study shows that the price of an <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> product is more elastic and consumers are prepared to pay more for an <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> product. Consumers' willingness to pay more are rooted in an expectation of a higher quality and a desire to protect the environment. Emotions are a big motivation behind eco-friendly purchases and bottoms in either pride and guilt or a combination of the two. This study also proves that knowledge of why a product is <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> is a key factor as to why people consume <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|While {{organic farming}} is well {{established}} in Europe a nd USA, it is still catching up in Asian countries. The government of South Korea has implemented <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> farming that encompasses organic farming. Despite the promotion of <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> farming, it still has a low share in South Korea and partially converted farming has emerged in some districts of South Korea. However, the partially converted farming {{has not yet been}} investigated by the government. Thus, our study implemented a financial analysis to compare the annual costs and net returns of conventional, partially converted and <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> farming in Gangwon Province. The result showed that <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> farming was more profitable with respect to farm net returns. To find out the factors affecting the adoption of <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> farming, multinomial logistic regression was implemented. The findings revealed that education and subsidy positively and significantly influenced the probability of farmers' choice on partially converted and <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> farming. Farm size had a negative and significant relationship with only <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> farming. This study will contribute to future policy establishment for sustainable agriculture as recommended by improving the quality of fertilizers, suggesting the additional investigation associated with partially converted farmers. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

50|$|Advocates of more <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> {{processes}} {{claim that}} using refilled and remanufactured toner cartridges {{are much more}} <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> than using brand name new cartridges.

30|$|From {{the above}} consideration, let me assume the following: As the {{activity}} level of an <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> production process increases, environmental burdens or environmental costs {{made by the}} disposal activity are reduced, since the proportion of unintentionally improper disposal of waste also decreases, possibly due {{to an increase in}} proper information of product contents and so on. It may also be considered that coefficients of an <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> disposal process decrease as the proportion of an <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> production process to that of an environmentally unfriendly production process increases, since more proper information on product contents and so on is released and supposed to contribute to improvement of an <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> disposal process.|$|R
