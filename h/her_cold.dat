5|$|Gautier thought Heine's Wilis and Hugo's fifteen-year-old Spanish {{girl would}} make a good ballet story. His first idea was to present an empty ballroom {{glittering}} with crystal and candlelight. The Wilis would cast a spell over the floor. Giselle and other dancers would enter and whirl through the room, unable to resist the spell to keep them dancing. Giselle would try to keep her lover from partnering other girls. The Queen of the Wilis would enter, lay <b>her</b> <b>cold</b> hand on Giselle's heart and the girl would drop dead.|$|E
5|$|Lightning has {{received}} mixed commentary from critics—much of it relating to <b>her</b> <b>cold</b> personality, which {{was compared to}} that of Final Fantasy VIIs protagonist Cloud Strife. She was criticized for her relative absence in XIII-2. Her role in Lightning Returns had a mixed reception: some critics saw her as underdeveloped and unlikable, while others found her better developed and more human than in previous games. Lightning later appeared on lists, compiled by video game publications, of the best characters in the Final Fantasy series and in video games as a whole. She has been received favorably in polls of public opinion by Famitsu, Square Enix, and other organizations.|$|E

She only reluctantly agreed to {{interrupt}} training and participate in the summer event, which is contested on roller ski, however she went on to win gold in all three competitions (sprint, pursuit and mixed relay). Neuner missed the first World Cup of the 2009–10 season due to a cold in December 2009. She returned at the following races in Hochfilzen, but was still affected by <b>her</b> <b>cold</b> and finished outside the top 20. Her first podiums of the winter came in Pokljuka, finishing third in the sprint and second in the pursuit race. Thereby she secured her Olympic qualification within the German team.|$|E

She was not appointed for the individual race and could not start in the mixed relay due to <b>her</b> <b>cold.</b> On 21 February 2009, Neuner claimed silver as part Germany's women's relay team, alongside Martina Beck, Andrea Henkel and Kati Wilhelm.

5|$|The video {{introduces}} a sober, contemplative side of Madonna, revealing a mature mysticism. It {{begins with the}} camera skimming along a cracked, desiccated desert floor, and within seconds Madonna appears, hovering just above {{the ground in the}} distance. Her hands are covered with mehndi and an enigmatic symbol on one palm. In the video she slowly gestures and sways her arms toward the sky in the video, desperately pleading to <b>her</b> <b>cold</b> lover cited in the song. At one point Madonna falls, and as she hits the ground, she transforms into a flock of large, dark birds. Later, she transforms into a black dog. Three Madonnas also appear walking and crawling amid the desert throughout the video. As the song progresses, the sky darkens, and Madonna levitates from the ground. Her form then changes to a shiny black liquid, which runs along the desert floor and appears to be absorbed by the tattooed hands of another Madonna, who is curled up on the crenellated ground. The video ends with a desperate and melancholy Madonna.|$|E

Rodolfo, eager {{to spend time with}} the girl, to whom he is already attracted, finds the key and pockets it, feigning innocence. He takes <b>her</b> <b>cold</b> hand (Che gelida manina—"What a cold little hand") and tells her of his life as a poet, then asks her to tell him more about her life. The girl says her name is Mimì (Sì, mi chiamano Mimì—"Yes, they call me Mimì"), and {{describes}} her simple life as an embroiderer. Impatiently, the waiting friends call Rodolfo.

Rodolfo suggests remaining at home with Mimì, but she decides to accompany him to the Cafe Momus. As they leave, they sing of their newfound love.|$|E
500|$|In {{a letter}} to Mme. Hanska, Balzac {{indicated}} that he based the character of Bette on three women from his life: his mother, Mme. Hanska's aunt Rosalie Rzewuska, and the poet Marceline Desbordes-Valmore. Balzac had a tumultuous relationship with his mother {{for most of his}} life, and he incorporated some of her personality (particularly her [...] "obstinate persistence in living", as one critic calls it) into Bette. Rosalie Rzewuska disapproved of Mme. Hanska's relationship with Balzac; biographers agree that <b>her</b> <b>cold</b> determination was part of the author's recipe for Bette. Elements taken from Marceline Desbordes-Valmore are more complex; she faced many setbacks in life and she and Balzac became friends after she left the theatre to take up poetry.|$|E
500|$|Some {{other critics}} however, did not react so warmly towards Q's Nikita. Chris Conaton of PopMatters felt that Q [...] "seems to {{be a good}} choice for the title role," [...] but noted that the pilot did not call {{attention}} to the character's background. That said Conaton stated [...] "it's still something of a novelty to build a TV series around an Asian American lead—though plenty of recent ensemble and reality TV shows have featured prominent cast members of Asian descent." [...] Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe felt that Q was [...] "too much of a sad sack," [...] adding [...] "Q doesn't seem able to layer any other emotions over <b>her</b> <b>cold</b> resolve," [...] and compares the character to [...] "a little bit like [...] Debbie Downer." [...] Mary McNamara of The Los Angeles Times believed that while Nikita [...] "provides some sizzle," [...] her emotions [...] "run that famous distance from A to B, as do virtually [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|Following the {{resolution}} of Karen and David's storyline in the pilot, in which David concedes that the couple need to hire a nanny, Jacey Salles was cast as Ramona Ramirez. Salles was a bit-part actress in BBC sitcoms and had previously appeared in the 1998 Granada film The Misadventures of Margaret, which was co-produced by Harries. In <b>her</b> <b>Cold</b> Feet audition she was required to have a loud argument with her boyfriend over the telephone. She embellished this with [...] "a bit of comic bastardisation of the English language" [...] and won the part. Initially contracted for only two episodes, Salles assumed the Marsdens would employ a new nanny every few episodes, though she made two more appearances in the first series and eventually appeared in every series. Lennie James made two guest appearances as Kris Bumstead, though his second appearance in Episode 6 was mostly {{in the form of}} flashbacks. James was keen to find out {{the resolution}} to the [...] "who's the father?" [...] cliffhanger, reportedly repeatedly asking the producers whether the baby was Kris's. Other actors to make appearances were Denis Lawson as Alexander Welch and Sam Kelly as Algernon Gifford. John Thomson was pleased to work with Kelly, as he was a big fan of 'Allo 'Allo!, a sitcom in which Kelly appeared.|$|E

The divorce was finalised on 17 July 1822, and Hazlitt returned to London to see his beloved—only to find <b>her</b> <b>cold</b> and resistant. They then become involved in angry altercations of jealousy and recrimination. And it was over, though Hazlitt could not for some time persuade himself to believe so. His mind nearly snapped.

The film ranked 92 in the top 100 sexiest movie scenes poll conducted by Channel 4.

[...] She received a Filmfare Best Villain Award nomination for Jism. Her next release, Zameen, failed to make impact among audiences.|$|E
