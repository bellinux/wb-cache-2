40|$|The {{clustering}} <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>sterile</b> neutrinos are studied {{within an}} extension of the minimal standard model, where these are produced via the decay of a gauge singlet scalar. The distribution function after decoupling is strongly out of equilibrium. (DM) abundance and phase space density constraints from (dSphs) constrain the mass in the keV range consistent with a gauge singlet with mass and vacuum expectation value ∼ 100,GeV decoupling at this temperature. The (DM) transfer function and power spectrum are obtained from the solution of the non-relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation in the matter dominated era. The small momentum enhancement of the distribution function leads to long range memory of gravitational clustering and a substantial enhancement of the power spectrum at small scales compared to a thermal relic or sterile neutrino produced via non-resonant mixing with active neutrinos. The scale of suppression of the power spectrum for such sterile neutrino with m∼keV is λ∼ 488,kpc. At large scales T(k) ∼ 1 -C, k^ 2 /k^ 2 _fs(t_eq) + [...] . with C ∼O(1). At small scales 65 kpc≲λ≲ 500 kpc corrections to the fluid description and memory of gravitational clustering become important, and we find T(k) ≃ 1. 902 e^-k/k_fs(t_eq), where k_fs(t_eq) ∼ 0. 013 /kpc is the free streaming wavevector at matter-radiation equality. The enhancement of power at small scales may provide a possible relief to the tension between the constraints from X-ray and Lyman-α forest data. Comment: matches version to appear in PR...|$|R

However, these preparations either do not produce completely sterile tissue or are detrimental to molecules unique to the tissue matrix, thus compromising beneficial wound-healing <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> the AM graft. The objective of this work was to produce a sterile human AM tissue graft using a novel preparation technique involving supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO 2). AM tissue was subjected to various sterilization treatment groups that optimized the duration of exposure to SCCO 2 {{and the amount of}} peracetic acid (PAA) required to achieve a sterility assurance level of 10 - 6 log reduction in bacterial load.

40|$|The Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search (MINOS) is a long-baseline {{accelerator}} neutrino experiment {{designed to}} measure <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> neutrino oscillation. Using a high intensity muon neutrino beam, produced by the Neutrinos at Main Injector (NuMI) complex at Fermilab, MINOS makes two measurements of neutrino interactions.

40|$|The {{existence}} of neutrino oscillation {{is the first}} evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model. It proves that neutrinos are massive and motivates {{the study of the}} neutrino nature, mixings and mass generation models. To {{have a better understanding of}} neutrino masses and mixings, the existence and character <b>of</b> <b>sterile</b> neutrinos would be an important factor. In this thesis, we will describe the phenomena of neutrinoless double beta decay and sterile neutrino oscillations. The studies of these two topics will contribute to understanding the <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>sterile</b> neutrinos in the heavy and light mass regime. We first study the neutrinoless double beta decay process to tackle the issue about the nature of neutrino. Establishing the nature of neutrinos, whether they are Dirac or Majorana particles is one of the fundamental questions we need to answer in particle physics, and is related to the conservation of lepton number. Neutrinoless double beta decay is the tool of choice for testing the Majorana nature of neutrinos. However, up to now, this process has not been observed, but a wide experimental effort is taking place worldwide and soon new results will become available. Different mechanisms can induce neutrinoless double beta decay and might interfere with each other, potentially leading to suppressed contributions to the decay rate. This possibility would become of great interest if upcoming neutrino mass measurements from KATRIN and cosmological observations found that neutrino mass is larger than 0. 2 eV but no positive signal was observed in neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. We focus on the possible interference between light Majorana neutrino exchange with other mechanisms, such as heavy sterile neutrinos and R-parity violating supersymmetric models. We show that in some cases the use of different nuclei would allow to disentangle the different contributions and allow to test the hypothesis of destructive interference. Finally, we present a model in which such interference can emerge and we discuss the range of parameters which would lead to a significant suppression of the decay rate. Heavy sterile neutrino is involved in the studies of neutrinoless double beta decay and mass generation involve. On the other hand, the effect <b>of</b> light <b>sterile</b> neutrino may be present in the oscillation experiments. To measure the light sterile neutrino mixing, high statistics measurements are necessary. A neutrino factory has been suggested as a powerful tool for studying new physics, for example, sterile neutrinos, exploiting its near detectors. Here, we use the new version of GLoBES to study the potential of a low energy neutrino factory (LENF) in constraining the sterile mixing angles and the mass-square difference. Unlike in conventional long baseline neutrino experiments, the electron neutrino disappearance and appearance channels are also included, since they have been proved helpful in constraining some of the mixing angles. We will explore the dependence of the performance of the LENF depending on different experimental setups, such as the detector type (TASD and LiAr), the energy range, the systematic errors. etc. Moreover, the re-analysis of reactor neutrino experiments suggests the presence of neutrino oscillations due to large sterile neutrino mixing with electron neutrino. We show that, with a near detector, LENF can constrain the sterile parameter values in a very small range and helps us to check the recent Reactor Anomaly.
