40|$|Evgenii Abramovich Baratynskii (1800 – 1844) {{was one of}} Russia’s most {{significant}} writers of metaphysical and psychological poetry, dealing most notably with {{the conflict between the}} intellect and the emotions. 1 Within this conflict the intellect, and its representatives in the material world, science and technology, are generally portrayed as antithetical to harmony and happiness, but too powerful to be ignored; nature and the emotions, however, can be positive, when representing life and harmony, or negative, when representing either excessive passions or the “laws of nature ” as defined by science. While in the majority of Baratynskii’s work these two facets of the psyche are shown as locked in a binary opposition, there are moments in his oeuvre in which the poetic persona is able to transcend this dualism and achieve a transcendence and/or synthesis on the physical, artistic, and spiritual level. <b>This</b> article discusses <b>how</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>worked</b> out in poems about three different geographic locations that feature prominently in Baratynskii’s poetry: Finland, the homeland (i. e., Russia), and Italy.

40|$|Households {{around the}} world have shifted {{structurally}} from a breadwinner/homemaker model to dual-income earning arrangements. What this trend means for marital power has been a contested issue among scholars. Most studies suggest that household power is determined by a complex interplay between each spouse’s economic contributions to the household and existing gender norms. Few scholars, however, have examined <b>how</b> <b>this</b> interplay <b>is</b> <b>worked</b> out under particular political-economic conditions. Responding to the dearth of research on the developing world in this area, the author examines a community in Costa Rica where neo-liberal economic restructuring has led to an increase in women’s informal work and a decrease in men’s income-earning power. Drawing from ethnographic and interview data on married life in Costa Rica, the author analyzes the effect that these trends have on marital power and the division of household labor. The author argues that changing economic circumstances may blur the traditional gen-der boundaries in Costa Rican households but they do not necessarily erase them...|$|R
