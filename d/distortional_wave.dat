40|$|The energy {{finite element}} {{analysis}} (EFEA) is more effective for analyzing high frequency vibration problem compared to the traditional finite element method (FEM). When applying the EFEA to complicated structures, {{it is necessary to}} obtain power transfer coefficients at structural joints. This paper proposes the theoretical formulations of computing power transfer coefficients between two 3 D semi-infinite solids, and demonstrates the validation of the developed theoretical formulations through two examples with different incident waves: dilatational wave and <b>distortional</b> <b>wave...</b>|$|E
40|$|Knott's {{calculations}} of reflected and refracted waves at rock-water, slate-granite, and granite-slate interfaces are re-examined and corrected curves are given for incident compressional waves. The equations for energy ratios of reflected and refracted to incident mechanical waves at flat boundaries were first published by Knott (Knott 1899). Since then his equations {{have been widely}} used not only in seismology but also in ultrasonic testing and delay line technology. Knott also gave some numerical examples and graphs illustrating the behaviour of the resulting waves when a longitudinal (condensational-rarefactional) wave or a transverse (<b>distortional)</b> <b>wave</b> impinges on a flat boundary between two dissimilar media. Some of these figures were used by later authors, for example Arenburg (1948), to illustrate the phenomena of mode conversion and energy partition. Calculations of numerical values are rather involved, and it becomes difficult to avoid errors if computations are done by hand. The Michigan State University CDC- 3 600 computer was therefore used to recalculate three of the curves originall...|$|E
40|$|Adozelesin (formerly U 73 - 975, The Upjohn Co.) is a covalent, minor-groove binding {{analogue}} of the antitumour antibiotic (+) CC- 1065. Adozelesin {{consists of}} a cyclopropapyrroloindole alkylating sub-unit identical to (+) CC- 1065, plus indole and benzofuran sub-units which replace the more complex pyrroloindole B and C sub-units, respectively, of (+) CC- 1065. Adozelesin is a clinically important drug candidate, since it does not contain the ethylene bridge moieties on the B and C sub-units which {{are thought to be}} responsible for the unusual delayed hepatotoxicity exhibited by (+) CC- 1065. Sequencing techniques identified two consensus sequences for adozelesin binding as p(dA) and 5 '(T/A) (T/A) T-A*(C/G) G. This suggests that adozelesin spans a total of five base-pairs and shows a preference for A=T base-pair rich sequences, thus avoiding steric crowding around the exocyclic NH_ 2 of guanine and a wide minor groove. In this project, the covalent modification of two DNA sequences, i. e. 5 'd(CGTAAGCGCTTA*CG) _ 2 and 5 '-d(CGAAAAA*CGG) #centre dot# 5 '-d(CCGTTTTTCG), by adozelesin was examined by high-field NMR and restrained molecular mechanics and dynamics. Previous studies of minor groove binding drugs, using techniques as diverse as NMR, X-ray crystallography and molecular modelling, indicate that the incorporation of a guanine into the consensus sequence sterically hinders binding and, more importantly, produces a wider minor groove which is a 'slack' fit for the ligand. The aim of this investigation was to provide an insight into the sequence selective binding of adozelesin to 5 '-AAAAA*CG and 5 '-GCTTA*CG. The " 1 H NMR data revealed that, in both cases, #beta#-helical structure and Watson-Crick base-pairing was maintained on adduct formation. The 5 '-GCTTA*CG adduct displayed significant distortion of the guanine base on the non-covalently modified strand. This distortion resulted from an amalgamation of two factors. Firstly, the presence of a strong hydrogen-bond between the amide linker of the indole and benzofuran sub-units and the carbonyl of a central thymine base plus a second, weaker, hydrogen-bond to the exocyclic NH_ 2 of the guanine. Secondly, covalent modification of an adenine by adozelesin yields a <b>distortional</b> <b>wave</b> which terminates 6 base-pairs upstream in the 5 '-direction. " 1 H NMR data and the resulting molecular model show that adozelesin lies closer to the modified strand as a consequence of this strong hydrogen-bond and perhaps also of the distorted guanine pushing adozelesin to {{the opposite side of the}} groove. No distortion of this kind was noted in the 'A' tract model; however, the " 1 H NMR data shows that the adenine bases remain propeller twisted, which is characteristic of macroscopically bent DNA. This molecular model showed that, within this most preferred sequence, adozelesin lay centrally within this straighter 'A' tract, yielding an improved complementary fit of the drug within the DNA minor groove. No hydrogen-bonds were detected. This study indicates the possible role of the ureylene linker in the selective binding of adozelesin to the unpredicted GC-containing consensus sequence. Various other minor groove binders (cyanomorpholinoadriamycin, DSB- 120 and sibiromycin) also had their sequence-selectivity properties probed with limited success, owing to their inability to yield a single drug-DNA adduct for high-field NMR study. The adozelesin-DNA self-complementary adduct in this study has provided a new and exciting starting point for rational drug design of an adozelesin dimer, a proposed antineoplastic agent with enhanced sequence-selectivity. These adozelesin-DNA adducts have proved to be an excellent model system to investigate the molecular basis for DNA recognition and binding.

40|$|We may now {{complete}} this {{paper with a}} brief summary. 1. The movement of the ground is composed of four kinds of displacements; namely the displacement due to the transmission of shallow water waves, that due to Bayleigh-waves, that due to <b>distortional</b> <b>waves</b> and that due to dilatational waves. 2. The velocity of the transmission of the displacement of the body due to shallow water waves is {{equal to that of}} shallow water waves, while the transmission of the displacements of other kinds have their own velocities peculiar to the respective waves. 3. The amplitudes of the deformation of the solid body due to Rayleigh-waves and also to shallow water waves change as inverse square root of the epicentral distance, while those due to the dilatational and <b>distortional</b> <b>waves</b> diminish as inverse square of the epicentral distance. 4. Microseisms due to a disturbed weather occurring in a different region are chiefly due to long water waves, including breakers at the coast, advancing near the observing station, but not the seismic waves directly transmitted from the region of the disturbed weather. The action of the long water waves is, however, relatively small compared with that of breakers. 5. The amplitude of the ground due to pulsatory original disturbance of long periods is smaller than that due to short periods, even though the amplitude of the disturbing pressure is kept constant...|$|R
40|$|Spoilers in the ILC Beam Delivery System are {{required}} to survive without failure a minimum of 1 - 2 direct impacts from each energetic electron or positron bunch of charged particles, in addition to maintaining low geometric and resistive wall wake fields. The transient shock wave resulting from rapid localised beam heating {{and its implications for}} spoiler design are studied using ANSYS. Shockwave propagation is modelled in 2 dimensions showing the effect of dilatational shockwaves striking free surfaces, producing reflected dilatational and <b>distortional</b> <b>waves.</b> The implication of these relflected waves on the damage of the collimators is also discussed...|$|R
30|$|When the IE {{method is}} applied, a {{transient}} mechanical impact {{is generated by}} a hammer or a ball impactor on the beam surface. This mechanical impact will introduce stress waves, which include dilatational (P-) <b>wave,</b> <b>distortional</b> (S-) <b>wave,</b> and Rayleigh (R-) wave. The IE method mainly utilizes P-wave to determine {{the depth of the}} surface-opening crack because P-wave results in a considerably larger displacement than S- and R-waves. When the P-wave propagates in the beam along the spherical wavefronts, it will be reflected by the boundary of the crack and then be propagated as diffracted wave. The TOF technology, which is based on detecting the arrival time of the P-wave, can be used to estimate the crack depth.|$|R
40|$|Since k in Omori's {{empirical}} formula d=kt {{may be made}} to assume the physical meaning k=v 1. v 2 /(v 1 -v 2), where d is {{the distance of the}} seismic focus from a station, t the duration of the preliminary tremors at the said station, and v 1 and v 2 the respective transit velocities of the dilatational and <b>distortional</b> <b>waves,</b> it will be seen that the factor {{is by no means a}} constant, but must vary with v 1 and v 2, and must therefore be some function of the focal depth f, say, and the epicentral distance △. For near distances, Omori deduced for it the value 7. 42, but evidence is not wanting that in the younger geo-logical formations it may take as low a value as 2, or even 1. 5. For the local shocks so frequent in the Kii district, one of us obtained the value 3. 0. Consequently, in determining the seismic focus by t obtained at four or more stations with the assumption of wave transmission along a single straight line with k as constant, inaccuracies in the results will be inevitable. Similarly, the usual method of estimating focal depths by the time-distance curve of P-, P or S [...] P- must also be subject to several errors when the presence of a superficial sedimentary layer has been ignored...|$|R
40|$|The main revised {{results are}} as follows : (1) The amplitudes of the radial {{component}} of the displacement of the dilatational waves at a distant point have maximum values at certain ha's in both single and quadruple sources. (2) The amplitudes of the dilatational waves at a distant point in the two cases vanish when the wave lengths are very long compared with the dimension of the origin. (3) The amplitude of the dilatational wave generated from the quadruple source becomes appoximately equal to that from the single source when ha> 4, {{as the result of}} the fact that the <b>distortional</b> <b>waves</b> appear less and less intensely than the dilatational waves when the wave length diminishes as compared with the size of the seismic origin. (4) In the case where the normal pressure at the origin is expressed by two zonal harmonics P 0 (cosθ) and P 2 (cosθ), so long as the wave length is greater than the radius of the seismic origin, the component due to the term P 0 (cosθ) is greater than that due to the term P 2 (cosθ). Should the wave length become comparable with the dimension of the seismic origin, we find that the azimuthal distribution of the displacement of the dilatational wave becomes quite similar to the azimuthal distribution in the pressure at the seismic origin. (5) Although we cannot, from the mere results of these calculations, say anything conclusive regarding the wave length of such waves as might be generated from a seismic origin, the writer considers it preferable to think that waves might be generated having wave lengths comparable with the size of the origin than to think that the wave lengths of the waves are very much longer than the dimension of the seismic origin, (see summary of my "Notes on the Origins of Earthquakes, second paper.

40|$|The {{frequency}} equation for Stoneley-type waves with symmetric vibrations propagated along the interfaces between an internal stratum and two adjacent halfspaces, all perfectly elastic, homogeneous and isotropic, is obtained as the vanishing of a determinant {{of the fourth}} order. For large values of the frequency, the equation reduces to that of Stoneley waves at the interface be-tween two halfspaces. Discussion of the sign of this determinant for suitable values of the unknown leads to the condition {{for the existence of}} such waves both for a low-velocity and a high-velocity internal stratum. The ranges of values which the ratios of the elastic constants of the stratum and either halfspace must have are obtained by numerical computation and the results are presented both in tabular form and graphically. ’It is found that: (i) Stoneley waves with symmetric vibrations, when they exist, have their phase velocity lying between the <b>distortional</b> and Rayleigh <b>wave</b> velocities of the lower velocity medium. (ii) If, as is usual, a velocity ratio less than unity is associated with a density ratio less than unity, then suc...|$|R
