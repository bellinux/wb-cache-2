The ILS was likely operational, but the ILS frequency was not set because the pilots assumed it was not operational.

After break-off from <b>ILS</b> <b>approach,</b> the Captain ignored the tower controller’s suggestion to fly a bad weather circuit by saying “let him say whatever he wants to say”. The CVR recording and flight simulation show that the Captain probably decided to fly a managed approach, unbeknownst to the ATS.|$|E

The plane crashed in the Fairview area near Five Points West in the Ensley neighborhood and subsequently injured four persons on the ground, as well as destroying two homes. Of the 15 occupants on board, there were 13 fatalities.

40|$|The TDT {{provides}} a hypothesis {{test for the}} presence of linkage or association (linkage disequilibrium). However, since the TDT is a single test statistic, it cannot be used to separate association and linkage. The importance of this difficulty, following a significant TDT result, has been recently emphasized by Whittaker, Denham and Morris (2000), who alert the community to the possibility that a significant TDT may result from loose linkage and strong association, or from tight linkage and weak association. To attack this problem we start with the parametric model for family-based allele transmission data of Sham and Curtis (1995) (or Sham (1998)) and find that the parameters in the model are not always identifiable. So we introduce a reparameterization that resolves the identifiability issues and leads to a valid likelihood ratio (LR) test for linkage. Since the linkage and association parameters are both of interest, we next introduce and apply an integrated likelihood (<b>IL)</b> <b>approach</b> to provide separate point estimates and confidence intervals for these parameters. The estimates are shown to have generally small bias and mean square error, while the confidence intervals have good average length and coverage probabilities.

The landing took place with an {{instrument}} landing system (<b>ILS)</b> <b>approach,</b> with the autopilot coupler being used down to 100 to 60 meters (300–200ft) before a manual completion. The aircraft had three maintenance issues at Seattle, consisting of a non-functioning fast–slow airspeed function, low oil on the number one engine and a non-functioning lavatory light. The final crew arrived at Seattle–Tacoma {{an hour before the}} flight and was given necessary documentation. Flight time was estimated at two hours, 16 minutes. All preflight checks were concluded without discrepancies. The aircraft was de-iced and the altimeters set and cross-checked.

Flight 213 had only experienced some turbulence while approaching therefore it continued the approach. The Flight crew was still at normal mood condition, as Captain Noor's jokes and laugh were heard in the CVR. But a few minutes later, the flight finally encountered bad weather conditions. The flight crew entered bad weather, but still continued the approach, even though Bhoja Air's operational manual told crews to discontinue approach if bad weather was encountered. They continued the approach until finally they realized that they had entered an active cell. At this time, Captain Noor {{was worried about the}} condition, but continued the approach.

Emphasis is on the matrix of rates {{rather than on the}} matrix of transition probabilities, as the rates are independent of each other and directly reflect behavior, i.e., a movement from one state to another. The present analysis yields new relationships between population stocks and flows, equations that can analytically project multistate populations, and flexible procedures for determining the array of transfer rates. In addition, with the beginning and ending populations known, the new Intrinsic Linkage-Rate Ratio (IL-RR) approach can be used to estimate an interval’s rates of interstate transfer.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to develop an integrated-likelihood (<b>IL)</b> <b>approach</b> to {{estimate}} the genetic differentiation between populations. The conventional maximum-likelihood (ML) and pseudolikelihood (PL) methods that use sample counts of alleles may cause severe underestimations of FST, which means overestimations of θ = 4 Nm, when the number of sampling localities is small. To reduce such bias in the estimation of genetic differentiation, we propose an IL method in which the mean allele frequencies over populations are regarded as nuisance parameters and are eliminated by integration. To maximize the IL function, we have developed two algorithms, a Monte Carlo EM algorithm and a Laplace approximation. Our simulation studies show that the method proposed here outperforms the conventional ML and PL methods in terms of unbiasedness and precision.
