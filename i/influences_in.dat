5|$|Sony Entertainment {{originally}} conceived The Spectacular Spider-Man as {{a series}} of four DVDs, and asked Weisman and Cook to develop it. The central idea was to follow Spider-Man in his younger years in the comics; Weisman and Cook wanted to incorporate the styles of the early comic publications by Lee and Ditko. Reviewers have cited other <b>influences</b> <b>in</b> the themes, such as the live action film series and the Ultimate Spider-Man continuity.|$|E

5|$|A {{departure}} from the hip-hop and R sound of her previous studio albums, the track is a country and pop ballad revolving around body image and female empowerment. Media outlets had varying opinions of the song's genre, describing it as having soul, blues, gospel, and show tune <b>influences.</b> <b>In</b> the lyrics, Fantasia narrates a tragic story about a woman, while providing commentary on social class, marriage, and alcoholism. Inspired by her past, she recorded the single {{as a way to}} empower women and reconcile with her childhood insecurities.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{admits that}} there may be death metal <b>influences</b> <b>in</b> the vocals, but says {{that it was not a}} {{conscious}} design, and that the music does not have any other similarities to death metal. He claims that there are no black metal influences. He says that describing Celestiial's music as folk is a bad idea, as folk is such a broad, vague description as to make it meaningless. He says that what he is creating is neither folk, nor traditional, and even the harp songs are not traditional works, though they are influenced by the traditional music of the United Kingdom and traditional Irish music.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>influence</b> <b>in</b> organizational decisions is analysed {{in relation to}} institutional frameworks and characteristics inherent to decision topics. Distribution of influence {{is defined as the}} concentration of participants in decision process and their specific capability to influence decision outcomes. This definition encompasses two dimensions which are: participation in the decision processes and effective influence upon the decision outcomes. Institutional frameworks are distinguished according to the loci of their genesis and existence, that are: the focal organization the task-environment and the larger social context. Six characteristics inherent to decision topics are identified as related to variables defined as properties of decision. The analysis is carried out at two distinct stages. At the first stage, it examines the relationships of the institutional frameworks - existing at the organization and the task environment level - and of the properties of decisions with the {{distribution of}} <b>influence</b> <b>in</b> decision processes. At the second stage, the patterns of influence that emerged out of the first stage of analysis are analysed in terms of cultural traits prevailing in Brazilian society. The results point to variation in the distribution of <b>influence</b> <b>in</b> decision processes associated with factors of the taskenvironment, of the context of the organizations and characteristics inherent to decision topics. But they do not provide a wholly satisfactory explanation of such variation. A more general pattern of <b>influence</b> <b>in</b> management decisionmahing, characterized by low level of participation and high centre of <b>influence</b> <b>in</b> decision processes, appears as the dominant profile of the distribution of <b>influence</b> <b>in</b> Brazilian organizations. Interpreted {{in the light of the}} Brazilian social context, this pattern of <b>influence</b> <b>in</b> management decision making shows pervasive cultural traits, identified in the macro social system. Comparing the patterns of <b>influence</b> <b>in</b> management decisionmaking in Brazil and Britain, similarities and differences come to light. The comparative analysis corroborates the argument that patterns of <b>influence</b> <b>in</b> management decision making are bound to contingent as much as to institutional factors.

5|$|Bax {{was born}} in the London suburb of Streatham to a prosperous family. He was {{encouraged}} by his parents to pursue a career in music, and his private income enabled him to follow his own path as a composer without regard for fashion or orthodoxy. Consequently, he came to be regarded in musical circles as an important but isolated figure. While still a student at the Royal Academy of Music Bax became fascinated with Ireland and Celtic culture, which became a strong influence on his early development. In the years before the First World War he lived in Ireland and became a member of Dublin literary circles, writing fiction and verse under the pseudonym Dermot O'Byrne. Later, he developed an affinity with Nordic culture, which for a time superseded his Celtic <b>influences</b> <b>in</b> the years after the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Both The Pleasure Garden and The Mountain Eagle were {{produced}} in co-operation with Emelka Film Studios in Munich, Germany. The film was mostly shot at Emelka in Munich {{in the fall}} of 1925, and the film exteriors were shot on location in Obergurgl, in what is now the municipality of Sölden in the State of Tyrol in southwestern Austria, the Ötztal Alps standing in for the mountains and hollows of Kentucky. Due to producing the film in Germany, Hitchcock had more directorial freedom than he would have had in England, and <b>influences</b> <b>in</b> the technique and style of German cinema are evident in his early works.|$|E

Mega Man and Metroid were significant <b>influences</b> <b>in</b> its creation. The development was divided between Armature Studio and Comcept into their own distinctive proficiencies, while Asobo Studio assisted. ReCore received mixed reviews, the most critical of which noted insufficient design choices, technical issues regarding lengthy and unsuccessful loading screens – later redressed – and repetitive combat. Praise was overall focused on the story, platforming and controls.|$|E

5|$|In the Philosophie Zoologique, Lamarck {{proposed}} that species could acquire new characteristics from <b>influences</b> <b>in</b> their environment, in two rules that he named as laws. His first law stated that use or disuse of a body's structures would {{cause them to}} grow or shrink {{in the course of}} several generations. His second law held that any changes made in this way would be inherited. Together, Lamarck's laws imply the steady adaptation of animals to their environments.|$|E
5|$|Literature {{also served}} {{religious}} purposes. Beginning with the Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom, works of funerary literature written on tomb walls, {{and later on}} coffins, and papyri placed within tombs, were designed to protect and nurture souls in their afterlife. This included the use of magical spells, incantations, and lyrical hymns. Copies of non-funerary literary texts found in non-royal tombs suggest that the dead could entertain themselves in the afterlife by reading these teaching texts and narrative tales.

5|$|Since Madagascar gained {{independence}} from French colonial rule in 1960, Malagasy cuisine has reflected the island's diverse cultures and historic influences. Throughout the country, rice {{is considered the}} preeminent food and constitutes the main staple of the diet {{in all but the}} most arid regions of the south and west. Accompanying dishes served with rice vary regionally according to availability of ingredients and local cultural norms. Outside the home, Malagasy cuisine is served at simple roadside stalls (gargottes) or sit-down eateries (hotely). Snacks and rice-based meals may also be purchased from ambulatory street vendors. Upscale restaurants offer a wider variety of foreign cuisine and Malagasy dishes bearing French and other outside <b>influences</b> <b>in</b> preparation technique, ingredients and presentation alike.|$|E
5|$|St Andrew's Anglican Church {{has three}} {{distinctive}} internal transept arches, and {{was designed by}} a Presbyterian, Alexander Leckie Elphinstone Junior. The foundation stone was laid in 1883, {{and the top of}} the spire completed in 1906. The fast construction period, unusual for that time, was indicative of the area's affluence. Recent Asian <b>influences</b> <b>in</b> Summer Hill have brought about the introduction of non-Christian places of worship. The Wong Tai Sin (or Kwan Yin Kur) temple is located on the corners of Kensington Road and Liverpool Road in a building that was a Masonic temple in the 1920s.

5|$|Temples and cults in Egypt itself {{declined}} as the Roman economy deteriorated in {{the third}} century AD, and beginning in the fourth century, Christians suppressed the veneration of Egyptian deities. The last formal cults, at Philae, died out in the fifth or sixth century. Most beliefs surrounding the gods themselves disappeared within a few hundred years, remaining in magical texts into the seventh and eighth centuries. But many of the practices involved in their worship, such as processions and oracles, were adapted to fit Christian ideology and persisted {{as part of the}} Coptic Church. Given the great changes and diverse <b>influences</b> <b>in</b> Egyptian culture since that time, scholars disagree about whether any modern Coptic practices are descended from those of pharaonic religion. But many festivals and other traditions of modern Egyptians, both Christian and Muslim, resemble the worship of their ancestors' gods.|$|E
