40|$|This Master Thesis {{was done}} at Atlas Copco Rock Drills AB in Örebro. It treats how the {{geometry}} of <b>impact</b> <b>pistons</b> in hydraulic percussive rock drill hammers can be improved. The material in these pistons is highly loaded during each impact and there are cases where fatigue failure has occurred. One critical location for fatigue damage is the fillet between the boom and {{the tail of the}} piston. This is because the stress pulse from the impact is amplified in this area. By developing a full transient analysis for a piston in ANSYS, and by using design optimization, a new type of fillet was constructed from a cubic b-spline. This new fillet has the same length as the old fillet, a double radius fillet, on the piston tail, but it has 12 ‒ 16 % lower maximum stress range, depending on the stress measure. A special feature with this fillet is that it is cut into the material of the boom. In that way it could be longer than the double radius fillet which enables a larger radius of curvature and a longer distance to “lead” in the stress pulse into the tail. This results in lower stress ranges in the fillet. Several multiaxial stress fatigue methods were used to analyze the fatigue damage in the old double radius fillet and in the new undercut fillet. It was found that the double radius fillet has a safety factor of 0. 98 ‒ 1. 08 to infinite fatigue life and the undercut fillet has a safety factor of 1. 10 ‒ 1. 23 to infinite fatigue life, depending on the fatigue method. Because infinite fatigue life normally corresponds to 106 ‒ 107 equivalent stress cycles, and the piston is desired to withstand close to one billon impacts, the old double radius fillet does not leave any margins to effects which can occur in the giga-cycle regime. The undercut fillet on the other hand leaves some margins to these kinds of effects. Unfortunately, no fatigue parameters were known for the material in the considered piston, so they were estimated from empirical relations. During the work with the undercut fillet it was realized that the weight of the impact piston can be reduced by minimizing the weight of the piston tail without affecting its performance. By using design optimization with the constraint that the maximum stress range in the piston tail should not be larger than the maximum stress range in the double radius fillet, its weight was reduced by 38 %. With this change in mass, less energy is needed to accelerate the piston and less reflection energy is needed to be damped out. Validerat; 20130917 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E

40|$|A conservative, upwind {{numerical}} {{method is}} formulated for {{the solution of}} a two-phase (reactive solid and inert gas) model of deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) in granular energetic solids. The model, which is representative of most two-phase DDT models, accounts for complete nonequilibrium between phases and constitutes a nonstrictly hyperbolic system of equations having parabolic degeneracies. The numerical method is based on Godunov’s methodology and utilizes a new approximate solution for the two-phase Riemann problem for arbitrary equations of state. The approximate solution {{is similar to the}} Roe-type Riemann solution for single-phase systems. The method is able to accurately capture strong shocks associated with each phase without excessive smearing or spurious oscillations and can accurately resolve fine-scale detonation structure resulting from interaction between phases. The utility of the method is demonstrated by comparing numerical predictions with known solutions for three test cases: (1) a two-phase shock tube problem; (2) the evolution of a steady compaction wave in a granular material resulting from weak <b>piston</b> <b>impact</b> (∼ 100 m/s); and (3) the evolution of a steady two-phase detonation wave in an energetic granular material resulting from weak <b>piston</b> <b>impact.</b> The nominally second-order accurate numerical method is shown to have global convergence rates of 1. 001 and 1. 670 for inert test cases with (case 1) and without (case 2) discontinuities, respectively.

This paper describes a straightforward way of generating single water pulse with a hammer <b>impacting</b> a <b>piston</b> that rests {{on top of a}} chamber filled with water. This impacting action pressurises the water, expelling it at high velocity through a nozzle. A theoretical investigation is outlined aimed at gaining a better understanding of this system for generating water pulses.

This model is used to optimise the relative sizes of the hammer and piston as well as the height of the water column to produce the highest velocity water pulse. The model was validated by building an experimental apparatus. In these experiments maximum pressures of about 200 MPa were measured inside the chamber over a time period of about 560 μs. This produced a water pulse with maximum velocity of 600 m/s. Experiments were conducted with nozzle diameters between about 1 mm and 4 mm to study the effect of discharge volume on the pressure history.

This paper presents a numerical investigation on the effects of the combustion chamber insulation on the heat transfer, thermal efficiency and exhaust temperatures of a 1. 6 l passenger car, turbo-charged diesel engine. First, the complete insulation of the engine components, like pistons, liner, firedeck and valves, has been simulated. This analysis has showed that the piston is the component with the greatest potential for the in-cylinder heat transfer reduction and for Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) reduction, followed by firedeck, liner and valves. Afterwards, the study has been focused on the <b>impact</b> of different <b>piston</b> Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBCs) on heat transfer, performance and wall temperatures. This analysis has been performed using a 1 -D engine simulation code coupled with a lumped mass thermal model, representing the engine structure. A time-periodic wall conduction model has been used to calculate the wall temperature swings along the combustion chamber surface and within the engine cycle. Two different TBC materials, Yttria-Partially Stabilized Zirconia (Y-PSZ) and anodized aluminum, and different layer thicknesses have been simulated...|$|R
40|$|To {{model the}} shock-induced {{behavior}} of porous or damaged energetic materials, a nonequilibrium mixture {{theory has been}} developed and incorporated into the shock physics code, CTH. The foundation for this multiphase model {{is based on a}} continuum mixture formulation given by Baer and Nunziato. This multiphase mixture model provides a thermodynamic and mathematically-consistent description of the self-accelerated combustion processes associated with deflagration-to-detonation and delayed detonation behavior which are key modeling issues in safety assessment of energetic systems. An operator-splitting method is used in the implementation of this model, whereby phase diffusion effects are incorporated using a high resolution transport method. Internal state variables, forming the basis for phase interaction quantities, are resolved during the Lagrangian step requiring the use of a stiff matrix-free solver. Benchmark calculations are presented which simulate low-velocity <b>piston</b> <b>impact</b> on a propellant porous bed and experimentally-measured wave features are well replicated with this model. This mixture model introduces micromechanical models for the initiation and growth of reactive multicomponent flow that are key features to describe shock initiation and self-accelerated deflagration-to-detonation combustion behavior. To complement one-dimensional simulation, two-dimensional numerical calculations are presented which indicate wave curvature effects due to the loss of wall confinement. This study is pertinent for safety analysis of weapon systems...|$|R
