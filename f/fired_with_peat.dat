50|$|This {{class was}} the first express train {{locomotive}} with the Bavarian state railways. It was developed from the Class A IV. Unlike the A IV, the Class A V had a lower-pitched boiler and a wider firebox. In addition access to the valve gear was improved. Later still the vehicles were fitted with a steam dome. Because engines on the southern side of the Danube were <b>fired</b> <b>with</b> <b>peat,</b> they had a pear-shaped chimney. In addition these locomotives had different dimensions.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{two basic}} mineral {{magnetic}} measurements (mass specific magnetic susceptibility and frequency dependent susceptibility) {{is described in}} the investigation of archaeobotanical taphonomy from nine sites in West Lewis. Magnetic enhancement was observed throughout a range of archaeological deposits on each of the sites sampled. It is proposed that this magnetic enhancement stems from the spread of ash from hearths or other burning activities. The link between magnetic enhancement, ash content and carbonised plant macrofossil concentration is demonstrated across the sites. Much of the carbonised plant remains recovered from archaeological sites in Britain were most likely carbonised in household fires and subsequently spread across the site by various dispersal mechanisms. This taphonomic model is confirmed for the nine sites investigated through the independent proxy of mineral magnetism. A key implication of the model in Atlantic Scotland is the very poor preservation environment for carbonisation of plant macrofossils in <b>fires</b> <b>with</b> <b>peat</b> as its main fuel...|$|R
2500|$|Jameson is {{produced}} from {{a blend of}} grain whiskey and single pot still whiskey, which uses a mixture of malted and unmalted or [...] "green" [...] Irish barley, all sourced from within a fifty-mile radius around the distillery in Cork. The barley is dried in a closed kiln fired by natural gas (formerly anthracite coal). This {{is in contrast to}} the traditional method used in some Scotch whisky distilleries, which <b>fire</b> the kiln <b>with</b> <b>peat,</b> adding a distinctive peat flavour.|$|R
25|$|The {{model for}} Japanese whiskies {{is the single}} malt Scotch, {{although}} there are also examples of Japanese blended whiskies. The base is a mash of malted barley, dried in kilns <b>fired</b> <b>with</b> a little <b>peat</b> (although considerably less than in Scotland), and distilled using the pot still method. Before 2000, Japanese whisky was primarily for the domestic market and exports were limited. Japanese whiskies such as Suntory and Nikka won many prestigious international awards between 2007 and 2014. Japanese whisky has earned a reputation for quality.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "The Brollachan" [...] (Popular Tales II, Tale #37), a fuath is {{represented}} {{as being the}} mother of the brollachan (or brollichan), as a creature with eyes and a mouth but no shape, and limited ability of speech. When Murray or [...] "Ally" [...] of the mill stoked the <b>fire</b> <b>with</b> fresh <b>peat,</b> it caused severe burns to the brollachan lying there, prompting a fuath who was the brollachan's mother to appear, demanding vengeance for her son. But the misshapen brollachan, when asked about the identity of the culprit, could only answer [...] "me" [...] and [...] "you," [...] and the fuath abandoned. Campbell draws the parallel with the story of the Cyclops, who when attempting to name the man who blinded him could only say that it was [...] "No man" [...] who harmed him, because that was the pseudonym that Ulysses had given. This motif is also used in the Northumbrian tale of Ainsel or [...] "My Own Self".|$|R
30|$|Wildland fire C {{emissions}} for peatlands {{are being}} estimated despite {{the dearth of}} data associated with soil variables (extent and spatial pattern of temperate peatlands, peat depths, changes in bulk density with depth, and changes in C content with depth) and wildland fire characterization data (fire location, fire weather, fire perimeter, fuel biomass, fuel consumption biomass, and emission factors available to estimate changes in C stocks and non-CO 2 emissions). The difficulty in acquiring real-time temperate peatland wildfire C emissions data {{underscores the importance of}} estimating C emissions using a combination of field-based and remote-sensing techniques to refine aboveground and belowground combustion estimates, as well as the incorporation of land management factors such as surface hydrology and land use that contribute to the depth of wildfire peat combustion. Previous studies that estimated C emissions from peat-land fires have been constrained by the lack of pre-burn and post-burn paired point data to accurately determine the depth of soil consumption across the fire area (Page et al. 2002, Poutler et al. 2006); however, a more recent study has utilized a pre-burn and post-burn LIDAR method (Reedy et al. 2015). Reedy et al. (2015) concluded that the LIDAR elevation error was not a significant contributor to uncertainty in C emissions from <b>fires</b> <b>with</b> substantial <b>peat</b> consumption. In our study, a limited research budget prevented a LIDAR-to-LIDAR data point comparison to determine burn depth. We used publicly available pre-burn LIDAR data combined with field survey soil-surface elevation data to determine burn depth.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work was to demonstrate the possibilities to reduce the emission of fine particle forming alkali during co-combustion of wood <b>with</b> <b>peat</b> in a full scale (150 kW) grate fired boiler. For this purpose the particle emissions from a 150 kW district heating grate fired boiler situated in northern part of Kramfors, Sweden, were studied. During the experiment the district heating boiler was <b>fired</b> <b>with</b> sawdust fuel with a 0, 10 and 20 wt-% (zero, low, high) peat content respectively. Mass concentrations and particle size distribution were measured by using a DLPI (13 -step low-pressure cascade impactor) with a precyclone. The particle matter was analyzed for morphology and elemental composition using SEM/EDS (Scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy). In addition, chemical equilibrium model calculations were used to interpret the experimental findings. The present study clearly shows that reduction of fine particles (< 1 um) is possible when co-combusting wood pellets <b>with</b> <b>peat</b> pellets in grate fired boilers. When 10 wt % peat {{was added to the}} wood/peat fuel mixture the fraction of fine particles was significantly decreased (about half of that emitted during pure softwood pellet combustion). The fine particles were for all fuel types/mixtures dominated by potassium, chlorine, sulfur, sodium and zinc. The result from this work therefore shows that a significant reduction of fine particle alkali is possible when co-combusting wood pellets <b>with</b> <b>peat.</b> The results from the thermo-chemical calculations suggest that a significant share of the potassium is retained in the bottom ash as a K rich silicate slag and as KAlSi 2 O 6 (s) (Leucite) when co-combusting sawdust <b>with</b> <b>peat.</b> Validerat; 20110920 (anonymous...|$|R

40|$|Combustion {{of biomass}} {{with a high}} content of alkali (mainly potassium, K) and {{chlorine}} (Cl) can result in operational problems including deposit formation and superheater corrosion. Among the measures applied to decrease such problems are co-combustion {{and the use of}} additives. The positive effects of these measures are to a large extent either sulphation of the alkali chlorides (KCl) to less corrosive alkali sulphates or capture of alkali from KCl during release of HCl. A test campaign was carried out in a large-scale circulating fluidised boiler <b>fired</b> <b>with</b> biomass where the measures applied were sulphation by ammonium sulphate and co-combustion <b>with</b> <b>peat.</b> Their performance was evaluated by means of several advanced measurement tools including: IACM (on-line measurements of gaseous KCl); a low-pressure impactor (size distribution and chemical composition of extracted fly ash particles) and deposit measurements (chemical composition in collected deposits). The overall performance was better for ammonium sulphate, which significantly lowered KCl in the flue gas. Meanwhile no chlorine was found in the deposits. Only a minor reduction of gaseous KCl was obtained during co-combustion <b>with</b> <b>peat</b> although the chlorine content in the deposits was greatly reduced. These findings were supported by the results from the impactor measurements. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Two composts {{prepared}} from agroindustrial wastes were assayed as substrates: C 1 from brewing waste (yeast and malt) plus {{lemon tree}} pruning and C 2 from the solid fraction of olive mill wastewater plus olive leaves. Sixteen substrates were prepared by combining each compost <b>with</b> Sphagnum <b>peat</b> or a Commercial Substrate (CS) in different proportions. The nutrients (N and K) {{provided by the}} composts, which acted as slow-release fertilizers, influenced especially the development of calendula, although the physical and physico-chemical properties such as total pore space and Electrical Conductivity (EC) were also relevant. On the other hand, in the salt-sensitive Gaillardia hybrid, EC and chloride concentration were the main factors influencing growth. The best results were found in substrates prepared by mixing C 1 at up to 75 % <b>with</b> <b>peat,</b> or at up to 50 % with CS, or by mixing C 2 at up to 50 % <b>with</b> <b>peat</b> or CS, for calendula. For salt-sensitive species such as Gaillardia, adequate substrates for plant development were found for C 1 at up to 50 % <b>with</b> <b>peat</b> or CS, {{but the use of}} C 2 should be limited to 25 % in mixtures <b>with</b> <b>peat</b> or CS. Therefore, composts of agroindustrial origin such as these can be used as an alternative to peat and CSs for growing ornamental plants, provided the mixture contains at least 25 % peat or CS...|$|R
