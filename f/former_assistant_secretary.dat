Charles Francis Adams, minister in London during Seward's tenure as secretary, deemed him [...] "more of a politician than a statesman", but Charles Anderson Dana, <b>former</b> <b>Assistant</b> <b>Secretary</b> of War, disagreed, writing that Seward had [...] "the most cultivated and comprehensive intellect in the administration" [...] and [...] "what is very rare in a lawyer, a politician, or a statesman—imagination".|$|E

500|$|Due to prior {{experience}} in {{arms control and}} his personal relationship with Khrushchev, <b>former</b> <b>Assistant</b> <b>Secretary</b> of War John J. McCloy was first considered the likely choice for chief US negotiator in Moscow, but his name was withdrawn after {{he turned out to}} be unavailable over the summer. W. Averell Harriman, a former ambassador to the Soviet Union well respected in Moscow, was chosen instead. The US delegation would also include Adrian S. Fisher, Carl Kaysen, John McNaughton, and William R. Tyler. In Britain, Macmillan initially wanted David Ormsby-Gore, who had just completed a term as foreign minister, to lead his delegation, but there were concerns that Ormsby-Gore would appear to be a US [...] "stooge" [...] (Kennedy described him as [...] "the brightest man he ever knew"). Instead, Macmillan chose Quintin Hogg. Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., a special advisor to Kennedy, believed that Hogg was [...] "ill prepared on the technicalities of the problem and was consumed by a desire to get a treaty at almost any cost." [...] Andrei Gromyko, the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs, served as Moscow's emissary.|$|E

500|$|According to {{newspapers}} reporting Lane's death, it {{was said}} that had he been born in the United States he would have been elected President. Following Lane's death, a memorial committee was formed by Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, <b>former</b> <b>Assistant</b> <b>Secretary</b> of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt and former Lane assistant and member of the Federal Reserve Board Adolph C. Miller. The committee established a Franklin K. Lane Memorial Fund, initially dedicated to the support of Lane's widow, Anne Lane, and upon her death to be used to promote causes in which her husband believed. [...] The two future presidents, Miller, and National Park Service Director Mather were among the major contributors to the fund. [...] In 1939, after Mrs. Lane's death, the corpus of the trust (just over $100,000) was transferred to the former Secretary's alma mater, the University of California, to promote the understanding and improvement of the American system of democratic government. Fifty years later, the entrusted amount, still administered by the University, had grown to almost $1.9 million. In November 1921, Lane Peak in Mount Rainier National Park was named for the former Secretary. Other tributes to Lane included a World War II Liberty ship, a New York City high school, and a California redwood grove. Lane's patriotic essay [...] "Makers of the Flag" [...] adapted from a speech he delivered to Interior Department employees on Flag Day 1914, continues to be reprinted as a speech and in schoolbooks.|$|E
500|$|Vice President Hobart {{had died}} in late 1899. [...] President McKinley was content to leave {{the choice of a}} vice presidential {{candidate}} for 1900 to the upcoming Republican convention. [...] New York Senator Platt disliked his state's governor, <b>former</b> <b>Assistant</b> <b>Secretary</b> of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt, who had pursued a reformist agenda in his year and a half in office. [...] Platt hoped to sideline Roosevelt politically [...] by making him vice president. [...] Roosevelt was a popular choice in any event because of his well-publicized service during the Spanish–American War, and Platt had little trouble persuading state delegations to vote for Roosevelt after McKinley's renomination. [...] Quay was a close Platt ally in the effort to make Roosevelt vice president. [...] Hanna, who felt Roosevelt was overly impulsive, did not want him on the ticket, but did not realize that the efforts were serious until he was already at the convention in Philadelphia. [...] As many of the delegates were political appointees, Hanna hoped to persuade McKinley to use patronage to get the delegates to vote for another candidate. [...] After emerging from the telephone booth from which he had tried and failed to get McKinley to agree, Senator Hanna stated, [...] "Do whatever you damn please! I'm through! I won't have anything {{more to do with the}} convention! I won't take charge of the campaign! I won't be chairman of the national committee again!"
