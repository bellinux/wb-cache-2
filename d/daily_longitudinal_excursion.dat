40|$|INTRODUCTION Hyperglycemia {{associated}} with diabetes mellitus (DM) has adverse impacts on peripheral nerve connective tissue structure, {{and there is}} preliminary evidence that nerve biomechanics may be altered. METHODS Ultrasound imaging was utilized to quantify the magnitude and timing of tibial nerve excursion during ankle dorsiflexion in patients with DM and matched healthy controls. RESULTS Tibial nerve <b>longitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> at the ankle and knee was reduced, and timing was delayed at the ankle in the DM group. Severity of neuropathy was correlated with larger reductions in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>excursion.</b> Nerve cross-sectional area was increased at the ankle in the DM group. CONCLUSIONS Larger tibial nerve size within the tarsal tunnel in patients with DM may restrict <b>longitudinal</b> <b>excursion,</b> which was most evident with more severe neuropathy. It is hypothesized that these alterations {{may be related to}} painful symptoms during functional activities that utilize similar physiological motions through various biomechanical and physiological mechanisms...|$|R

Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> of the median nerve, and the ratio of nerve to flexor digitorum superficialis tendon excursion at the carpal tunnel evoked by finger extension. Measurements were taken using a validated Doppler ultrasound technique, and tests were conducted with the elbow positioned in extension and flexion.

40|$|The use of {{electronic}} devices, such as mobile phones and computers, has increased drastically {{among the young}} generation, but the potential health effects of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) on university students has not been comprehensively examined. Thirty-one university students aged 18 to 25 y with no symptoms of CTS were successfully recruited in this study. By using noninvasive ultrasonography, the morphological characteristics of the median nerve of each volunteer, {{and the extent of}} its <b>longitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> movement under experimental conditions, in which a real operating environment {{of electronic}} devices was simulated, were quantified. The results demonstrated that the median nerve at the carpal tunnel inlet was flattened during wrist extension: the flattening ratio increased from 3. 40 ± 0. 91 at the neutral position to 4. 10 ± 1. 11 at the angle of 30 ° and 4. 09 ± 1. 11 at the angle of 45 °. In addition, the median nerve became swollen after the students performed rapid mobile-phone keying for 5 min, indicated by {{a significant increase in the}} cross-sectional area from 6. 05 ± 0. 97 mm 2 to 7. 56 ± 1. 39 mm 2. Passive <b>longitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> was observed at the median nerve when the students performed mouse-clicking (2. 4 ± 1. 0 mm) and mobile-phone keying tasks (1. 7 ± 0. 6 mm), with the mouse-clicking task generating a greater extent of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> than the mobile-phone keying task did.

OBJECTIVES To determine in an in vivo study whether {{different types of}} nerve-gliding exercises are associated with different amounts of <b>longitudinal</b> nerve <b>excursion.</b> BACKGROUND Different types of nerve-gliding exercises have been proposed. It is assumed that different exercises produce different amounts of excursion and strain in the peripheral nervous system. Although this has been confirmed in cadaveric experiments, in vivo studies are lacking. METHODS High-resolution ultrasound {{was used to measure}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> of the median nerve in the upper arm during 6 different nerve-gliding exercises. Nerve mobilization techniques that involved the elbow and neck were evaluated in 15 asymptomatic volunteers (mean +/- SD age, 30 +/- 8 years). Nerve <b>longitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> was calculated using a frame-by-frame cross-correlation analysis. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to analyze the data. RESULTS Different exercises induced different amounts of <b>longitudinal</b> nerve <b>excursion</b> (P<. 0001). The "sliding technique" was associated with the largest excursion (mean +/- SD, 10. 2 +/- 2. 8 mm; P =. 0001). The amount of nerve movement associated with the "tensioning technique" (mean +/- SD, 1. 8 +/- 4. 0 mm) was smaller than the nerve excursion induced with individual movements of the neck or elbow (mean +/- SD range, - 3. 4 +/- 0. 9 to 5. 6 +/- 2. 1 mm; P =. 0001). CONCLUSION These findings confirm that different types of neurodynamic techniques have different mechanical effects on the nervous system. Recognition of these differences may assist in the selection of treatment techniques. Having demonstrated differences in mechanical effects, future research will have to evaluate whether these different techniques are also associated with different physiological and therapeutic effects...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{ability of}} {{peripheral}} nerves to stretch and slide {{is thought to}} be of paramount importance to maintain ideal neural function. Excursion in peripheral nerves such as the tibial can be measured by analysis of ultrasound images. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the degree of <b>longitudinal</b> tibial nerve <b>excursion</b> as the ankle moved from plantar flexion to dorsiflexion in a standardised weight-bearing position. The reliability of ultrasound imaging to measure tibial nerve excursion was also quantified. Methods The tibial nerve was imaged over two separate sessions in sixteen asymptomatic participants in a weight-bearing position. <b>Longitudinal</b> nerve <b>excursion</b> was calculated from a three-second video loop captured by ultrasound imaging using frame-by-frame cross-correlation analysis. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess the intra-rater reliability. Standard error of the measurement (SEM) and smallest real difference (SRD) were calculated to assess measurement error. Results Mean nerve excursion was 2. 99 mm SEM ± 0. 22 mm. The SRD was 0. 84 mm for session 1 and 0. 66 mm for session 2. Intra-rater reliability was excellent with an ICC = 0. 93.

40|$|Background: A {{modified}} {{straight leg}} raise {{test for the}} sural nerve (SLR SURAL) has been proposed {{to assist in the}} differential diagnosis of sural nerve pathology in people with posterior calf or ankle pain, or lateral foot pain. The biomechanical rationale is that strain in the dorsolateral ankle and foot structures following dorsiflexion-inversion can be selectively increased in the sural nerve with hip flexion. There are however no studies which have investigated whether hip flexion can increase strain in the sural nerve at the ankle. Objectives: To measure strain and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> of the sural nerve and Achilles tendon during a modified SLR.

40|$|Minimal data {{exists on}} how much sciatic nerve motion occurs during {{straight}} leg raise (SLR). The {{purpose of this study}} was to report preliminary normative ranges of sciatic nerve excursion using real time ultrasound during a modified SLR. The sciatic nerve was scanned in the posterior thigh in sixteen asymptomatic participants (age range 19 - 68 years). Nerve excursion was measured in transverse and longitudinal planes during knee extension from 90 ° to 0 °, with the hip flexed to 30 ° and 60 °. The ultrasound data was analysed off-line using cross correlation software. Results demonstrated that most nerves moved superficially during knee extension, a large proportion (10 / 16) moved laterally. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> ranged from 6. 4 to 14. 7  mm (mean (SD) 9. 92  mm (2. 2)) in 30 ° hip flexion, and 5. 1 - 20. 2  mm (mean (SD) 12. 4  mm (4. 4)) in 60 ° hip flexion. Mean nerve excursion was significantly greater in 60 ° hip flexion (p =  0. 02).

Equivalent clinical tests for dogs would be valuable to differentially diagnose lumbosacral pain. To develop such a test, the increase in strain in the sciatic nerve of dogs and the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> of the nerve in relation to its surrounding structures during hind limb movements were evaluated. A miniature strain gauge was inserted into the sciatic nerve in seven canine cadavers and excursion was measured using a digital calliper. A cumulative increase in strain of 7. 2 % (± 2. 8 %) was observed for the combined movements of hip flexion, stifle extension, hock flexion and digit extension (P < 0. 0001). Although all components contributed significantly to the increase (P = 0. 03), the sciatic nerve demonstrated a curvilinear response to increased loading. A 10. 0 ± 1. 0 mm excursion was recorded with stifle extension (P = 0. 002). It was concluded that, the sciatic nerve in dogs accommodates to joint movements by stretching and gliding.

40|$|It {{is assumed}} that strain in a nerve segment {{at the end of}} a neurodynamic test will be {{greatest}} if the joint nearest that nerve segment is moved first in the neurodynamic test sequence. To test this assumption, the main movements of the median nerve biased neurodynamic test were applied in three different sequences to seven fresh-frozen human cadavers. Strain and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> were measured in the median nerve at the distal forearm. Strain and relative position of the nerve {{at the end of a}} test did not differ between sequences. The nerve was subjected to higher levels of strain for a longer duration during the sequence where wrist extension occurred first. The pattern of excursion was different for each sequence. The results highlight that order of movement does not affect strain or relative position of the nerve at the end of a test when joints are moved through comparable ranges of motion. When used clinically, different neurodynamic sequences may still change the mechanical load applied to a nerve segment. Changes in load may occur because certain sequences apply increased levels of strain to the nerve for a longer time period, or because sequences differ in ranges of joint motions.

Poor saddle cushioning may limit performance or even affect soundness of the back. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure the pressure under an average racing saddle ridden by a jockey at racing speed. Saddle pressure using a medium-sized racing saddle (length 37 cm, weight 450 g) was measured in five actively racing Thoroughbred horses. All horses were trained at the same facility and ridden by their usual professional jockey, weighing 60 kg. The horses were ridden on a race track at canter (mean velocity, V 1 ± standard deviation, SD: 7. 7 ± 0. 4 m/s) and gallop (V 2 ± SD: 14. 0 ± 0. 7 m/s). Maximal pressure was 134 kPa at V 1 and 116 kPa at V 2. Mean peak pressure was 73. 6 kPa at V 1 and 54. 8 kPa at V 2. The maximal total force did not differ between the two velocities and was approximately twice the jockey’s bodyweight. The centre of pressure lateral range of motion differed significantly, with excursions of 23 mm at V 1 and 37 mm at V 2; <b>longitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> was 13 mm for V 1 and 14 mm for V 2.

40|$|Treatment {{of painful}} neuromas {{of the upper}} limb has been largely debated. The current {{surgical}} treatments spare from simple neuroma excision to proximal nerve stump relocation (into muscles, veins, and bones). Perineural fat grafting consists of neuroma excision {{and the creation of}} an autologous adipose graft wrapped around the proximal nerve stump. This technique should be prescribed to those patients suffering from terminal neuromas or neuromas in which functional reconstruction is contraindicated. The effectiveness of this technique could be addressed both to the mechanical and biological properties of the fat graft. On one hand the graft creates a gliding layer and a protective barrier, thus allowing <b>longitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> and protection against mechanical solicitations. On the other hand the autologous adipose tissue brings neoangiogenesis, modulates the inflammatory response, and avoids scar adherences. A retrospective analysis was performed on 7 neuromas in 7 patients, treated with perineural fat grafting from June 2009 to February 2010. Pain and limb functionality were measured, respectively, with a visual acuity scale and the "Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score," preoperatively and 1 year after surgery. A mean pain reduction of 23 % was recorded, without relevant complications. Improvements in limb functionality were also observed through the measurement of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score, which improved to 18 %.

40|$|Introduction: The {{slump test}} {{is used in}} athletes with {{suspected}} hamstring strains to determine the presence of neural mechanosensitivity. Other than cadaveric investigations, limited evidence exists regarding this test {{with respect to the}} neuromuscular system. Aim: To examine the effect of the slump test on local muscular and neural structures in the posterior thigh in athletes with hamstring injury. Methods: Electromyography and ultrasound were utilised to determine hamstring muscle activity onset and sciatic nerve excursion respectively. Predictability of the slump test with respect to hamstring injury occurrence was also investigated. Results: 96 % (n= 26) of therapists used the slump test diagnostically, whilst 63 % utilised it as a treatment tool. The slump test was ineffective at predicting hamstring injury occurrence. In hamstring injured athletes (n= 10) the slump test with cervical flexion, was found to activate biceps femoris significantly earlier (p< 0. 008) than semitendinosus, also pain and resistance, in the injured limb. Reduced sciatic nerve <b>longitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> in the injured limb of two athletes with no radiological evidence of hamstring muscle damage was observed during the slump test with cervical flexion and ankle dorsi-flexion; a finding not replicated in the one athlete who had an actual hamstring muscle injury. Conclusions: Biceps femoris appears to act to protect the local neural system in the posterior thigh in hamstring injured athletes. Considering two athletes with posterior thigh pain had no muscle damage to the hamstring muscles, yet presented with reduced sciatic nerve excursion in the injured limb during the slump test, the possibility of biceps femoris acting to protect the nervous system is feasible.

40|$|Background: Plantar heel pain {{may result}} from several {{conditions}} such as tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS) and plantar fasciitis. The dorsiflexion-eversion test is used to diagnose TTS, whereas the windlass test is used for plantar fasciitis. Given the similarity between both tests, {{the purpose of this study}} was to evaluate whether these tests are able to selectively load the structures which they aim to examine. Methods: Both tests were evaluated in six cadavers by measuring strain in the plantar fascia, tibial nerve, lateral plantar nerve (LPN), and medial plantar nerve (MPN) using miniature displacement transducers. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> of the nerves was measured with a digital caliper. Results: With the dorsiflexion-eversion test, dorsiflexion and eversion of the ankle in combination with extension of the metatarsophalangeal (NITP) joints significantly increased strain in the tibial nerve (+ 1. 1 %), LPN (+ 2. 2 %), and MPN (+ 3. 3 %) but also in the plantar fascia (+ 1. 2 %) (all: p = 0. 016). Both components (dorsiflexion-eversion and MTP extension) resulted in significant increases. With the windlass test, extension of all MTP joints significantly increased strain in the plantar fascia (+ 0. 4 %, p = 0. 016), but also in the tibial nerve (+ 0. 4 %, p = 0. 016), LPN (+ 0. 8 %, p = 0. 032) and MPN (+ 2. 0 %, p = 0. 016). Excursion of the nerves was always in the distal direction but only reached significance for the tibial nerve (6. 9 mm, p = 0. 016) and LPN (2. 2 mm, p = 0. 032) during the dorsiflexion-eversion test.

Data are reported from three observational cohort studies including infants aged less than 72 hours of age and greater than 33 weeks’ gestational age (GA) who received special care (n= 50), intensive care (n= 25) or total body cooling (n= 14). For {{the first three days}} of life infants had routine daily clinical assessments (e. g. blood pressure), echocardiographic (superior vena cava flow and right ventricular outflow) and plethysmographic measurements (modified pleth variability index and pulse transit time). <b>Daily</b> <b>longitudinal,</b> comparative and correlational analysis of these measures within and between cohorts of neonates were performed. In addition, their relationships to assessments of short term neurological outcomes and cardiovascular treatment were explored.

The results indicate that the cardiovascular systems of between the three cohorts of neonates studied adapt differently over the first three days of life. Specifically, neonates who receive total body cooling exhibited significantly lower blood pressures, heart rates and measures systemic blood flow compared to neonates who are healthy or receiving intensive care. Healthy neonates aged between 33 to &# 60; 37 weeks GA exhibited daily significant shortening of modified pulse transit time and increased measures of systemic blood flow indicating these neonate’s systemic vascular resistances increase more gradually compared to term neonates with end organ perfusion maintained through increased cardiac output.

ResultsRenal failure was confirmed by concentrations (X ± SEM) of serum urea nitrogen (mmol/L) and creatinine (μmol/L) in UREM (20 ± 1 and 89. 4 ± 4. 5) and UREM-GH (16 ± 1 and 91. 4 ± 6. 9) that were much higher (P < 0. 001) than those of sham animals (SAL, 3 ± 0 and 26. 5 ± 2. 2; SPF, 4 ± 0 and 26. 5 ± 2. 1). UREM rats became growth retarded as shown by a <b>daily</b> <b>longitudinal</b> tibia growth rate below (P < 0. 05) that observed in SAL animals (156 ± 3 vs. 220 ± 5 μm/day). GH treatment resulted in significant growth rate acceleration (213 ± 6 μm/day). GHRH receptor mRNA levels were no different among the SAL (0. 43 ± 0. 03), SPF (0. 43 ± 0. 08) and UREM (0. 44 ± 0. 04) groups, whereas UREM-GH rats had significantly higher values (0. 72 ± 0. 07). ConclusionsThe status of pituitary GHRH receptor is not modified by nutritional deficit or by severe uremia causing growth retardation. By contrast, the growth promoting effect of GH administration is associated with stimulated GHRH receptor gene expression...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Research has {{established}} {{that the amount of}} inherent tension a peripheral nerve tract is exposed to influences nerve excursion and joint range of movement (ROM). The effect that spinal posture has on sciatic nerve excursion during neural mobilisation exercises has yet to be determined. The purpose of this research was to examine the influence of different sitting positions (slump-sitting versus upright-sitting) on the amount of longitudinal sciatic nerve movement during different neural mobilisation exercises commonly used in clinical practice. Methods: High-resolution ultrasound imaging followed by frame-by-frame cross-correlation analysis was used to assess sciatic nerve excursion. Thirty-four healthy participants each performed three different neural mobilisation exercises in slump-sitting and upright-sitting. Means comparisons were used to examine the influence of sitting position on sciatic nerve excursion for the three mobilisation exercises. Linear regression analysis was used to determine whether any of the demographic data represented predictive variables for <b>longitudinal</b> sciatic nerve <b>excursion.</b> Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} sciatic nerve excursion (across all neural mobilisation exercises) observed between upright-sitting and slump-sitting positions (P[*]=[*] 0. 26). Although greater body mass index, greater knee ROM and younger age were associated with higher levels of sciatic nerve excursion, this model of variables offered weak predictability (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 22). Discussion: Following this study, there is no evidence that, in healthy people, <b>longitudinal</b> sciatic nerve <b>excursion</b> differs significantly with regards to the spinal posture (slump-sitting and upright-sitting). Furthermore, although some demographic variables are weak predictors, the high variance suggests that there are other unknown variables that may predict sciatic nerve excursion. It can be inferred from this research that clinicians can individualise the design of seated neural mobilisation exercises, using different seated positions, based upon patient comfort and minimisation of neural mechanosensitivity with the knowledge that sciatic nerve excursion will not be significantly influenced...|$|R
40|$|Background: Marathon runners (MTH) and {{patients}} with mitral regurgitation (MR) exhibit left ventricular (LV) overload, and LV geometric changes in these {{groups have been}} reported. In this study, right ventricular (RV) adaptation to chronic volume overload was evaluated in MTH and MR and normal controls together with interventricular septal remodeling and tricuspid annulus (TA) motion. Methods: A total of 60 age-matched subjects (including 19 MTH, 17 isolated chronic compensated MR patients and 24 normal subjects) underwent conventional cine and tagged cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Myocardial strain and curvature were computed on the interventricular septum and RV free wall. A dual-propagation technique was applied to construct RV volume-time curves for a single cardiac cycle. Similarly, the tricuspid annulus was tracked throughout the cardiac cycle to create displacement over time curve. Results: Septal curvature was significantly lower in MTH and MR compared to controls. No significant differences in RV free wall strain or RV ejection fraction were noted amongst the 3 groups. However, <b>longitudinal</b> TA <b>excursion</b> was significantly higher in MTH compared to controls (p= 0. 0061). The peak late diastolic TA velocity in MR was significantly faster than MTH (p= 0. 0031) and controls (p= 0. 020). Conclusions: Increased TA kinetics allows for improved RV performance in MTH. Septal remodeling was observed in both MR and MTH, therefore a direct relationship of septal remodeling to TA kinetics in athlete’s heart could not be elucidated in this study...|$|R
40|$|Background: Minimal data {{exists on}} in-vivo sciatic nerve motion during {{straight}} leg raise (SLR), particularly in symptomatic participants. Such data could help clinicians {{to better understand}} nerve mechanic changes following nerve dysfunction. Design: Cross-sectional, controlled laboratory study. Objectives: To investigate whether individuals with spinally referred leg pain have different nerve excursion patterns compared to healthy participants. Method: The sciatic nerve was scanned using ultrasound imaging in the posterior thigh in asymptomatic participants, and individuals with spinally referred leg pain sub-grouped into somatic pain, radicular pain or radiculopathy. Nerve excursion was measured in transverse and longitudinal planes during a side-lying modified SLR. The ultrasound data was analysed off-line using cross correlation software. Longitudinal plane data was collected from 16 asymptomatic and 60 symptomatic participants and transverse plane data from 16 asymptomatic and 56 symptomatic participants. Results: There {{was no significant difference}} in <b>longitudinal</b> nerve <b>excursion</b> between the 4 groups. The direction of transverse plane motion altered between groups. These varied movements may be related to protective muscle activation between the groups, although this is speculative at present. Conclusion: Longitudinal sciatic nerve excursion at the posterior thigh during a modified SLR is not different between asymptomatic participants and those with spinally referred leg pain. Transverse plane movement appears to be more varied. This may suggest that in individuals with nerve root pain, there is no restriction in nerve excursion. However, as it was not possible to measure excursion at the nerve root, more research is needed to confirm these findings...|$|R
40|$|Extensor Pollicis Brevis (EPB) is a tendon of {{the first}} dorsal wrist {{compartment}} and in vitro cadaver {{studies have shown that}} it moves approximately 14 - 15 mm over the wrist when the thumb is moved through a full range of extension to flexion. Additionally, it has been shown in vitro that wrist position has an effect on EPB excursion. To date there are no in vivo studies that have examined the excursion of this tendon, or the effect of wrist position. Greater knowledge of excursion of EPB at wrist level could provide valuable baseline information that may be utilised in further studies in relation to pathomechanics, causative factors, assessment and management of forearm conditions, for example deQuervains disorder. Additionally, in vivo excursion values may also have relevance for post-operative tendon rehabilitation, as well as tendon transfer and reconstructive surgery. Information gained may assist in further research involving similar methodology. The objectives of this study were to quantify in vivo excursion of EPB at the wrist in different wrist positions and to evaluate the reliability of the methods used. Ultrasound Imaging (USI) and a cross-correlation algorithm were utilised to assess 49 normal EPB tendons (25 subjects, mean age= 40. 7 ± 12. 8 yrs), through full thumb extension to full flexion, in three different wrist positions (45 ° extension, neutral, 45 ° flexion). Subjects attended on two different occasions. Within-session and between-session intra-rater reliability was analysed for all data, as well as for each of the selected wrist positions. Results showed that wrist position had a significant effect on EPB tendon excursion (p≤ 0. 05). EPB excursion in the neutral wrist position was statistically greater from the other two positions (p< 0. 05). Mean excursions for each position were: Neutral= 2. 78 mm± 1. 89, Extension= 1. 67 mm± 1. 15 mm, Flexion= 1. 62 ± 1. 4 mm. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) for all data within-session 1 and within-session 2 were high [ICC= 0. 88, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 0. 84 - 0. 91 and ICC= 0. 87, 95 % CI 0. 92 - 0. 90 respectively]. The neutral wrist position demonstrated excellent reliability for within-session 1 and within-session 2 [ICC= 0. 93, 95 % CI 0. 88 - 0. 96 and ICC= 0. 91, 95 % CI 0. 84 - 0. 95]. Between-session analyses was found to be acceptable for all data [ICC= 0. 76, 95 % CI 0. 66 - 0. 83] and high for the neutral wrist position [ICC= 0. 80, 95 % CI 0. 64 - 0. 89]. In conclusion, in vivo EPB tendon excursion measures have, for the first time, been quantified and significant effects of wrist position on EPB tendon excursion have been found. These measures {{have been found to be}} significantly less than those found in in vitro studies. Reliability analyses demonstrated high to excellent ICC values for both within-session and between-session data. USI and a cross-correlation algorithm are therefore considered to be reliable methods for measuring tendon excursion. Further studies evaluating and comparing EPB tendon excursion in a pathologically affected population are recommended. The methodology could also be utilised in evaluating <b>longitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> of other tendons...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} measure and {{quantify}} myocardial motion and deformation provides a useful tool {{to assist in the}} diagnosis, prognosis and management of heart disease. Myocardial motion can be measured by means of several different types of data acquisition. The earliest myocardial motion tracking technique was invasive, based on implanting radiopaque markers into the myocardium around the left ventricle, and recording the marker positions during the cardiac cycle by biplane cineradiography. Until recently, this was the only method with high enough spatial resolution of three-dimensional (3 D) myocardial displacements to resolve transmural behaviors. However, the recent development of magnetic resonance imaging techniques, such as displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE), make detailed non-invasive 3 D transmural kinematic analyses of human myocardium possible in the clinic and for research purposes. Diastolic left ventricular filling is a highly dynamic process with early and late transmitral inflows and it is determined by a complex sequence of many interrelated events and parameters. Extensive research has been performed to describe myocardial kinematics during the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle, but not by far the same amount of research has been accomplished during diastole. Measures of global and regional left ventricular kinematics during diastole are important when attempting to understand left ventricular filling characteristics in health and disease. This thesis presents methods for invasive and non-invasive quantification of cardiac kinematics, with focus on diastole. The project started by quantification of changes in global left ventricular kinematics during diastolic filling. The helical myocardial fiber architecture of the left ventricle produces both long- and short-axis motion as well as torsional deformation. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> of the mitral annular plane is an important component of left ventricular filling and ejection. This was studied by analyzing the contribution of mitral annular dynamics to left ventricular filling volume in the ovine heart. In order to quantify strains for a specific body undergoing deformation, displacements for a set of internal points at a deformed configuration relative to a reference configuration are needed. A new method for strain quantification from measured myocardial displacements is presented in this thesis. The method is accurate and robust and delivers analytical expressions of the strain components. The developed strain quantification method is simple in nature which aids to bridge a possible gap in understanding between different disciplines and is well suited for sparse arrays of displacement data. Analyses of myocardial kinematics at the level of myocardial fibers require knowledge of cardiac tissue architecture. Temporal changes in myofiber directions during the cardiac cycle have been analyzed in the ovine heart by combining histological measurements of transmural myocardial architecture and local transmural strains. Rapid early diastolic filling is an essential component of the left ventricular function. Such filling requires a highly compliant chamber immediately after systole, allowing inflow at low driving pressures. Failure of this process can lead to exercise intolerance and ultimately to heart failure. A thorough analysis of the relation between global left ventricular kinematics and local myocardial strain at the level of myocardial fibers during early diastole in the ovine heart was performed by applying the method for strain quantification and the technique for computing temporal changes in myocardial architecture on measures of myocardial displacements and tissue architecture in the ovine heart. As data acquisition technologies develop, quantification methods for cardiac kinematics need to be adapted and validated on the new types of data. Recent improvements of DENSE magnetic resonance imaging enable non-invasive transmural strain analyses in the human heart. The strain quantification method was first tailored to displacement data from a surgically implanted bead array but has been extended to applications on non-invasive DENSE data measured in two and three dimensions. Validation against an analytical standard reveals accurate results and in vivo strains agree with values for normal human hearts from other studies. The method has in this thesis been used with displacement data from invasive marker technology and non-invasive DENSE magnetic resonance imaging, but can equally well be applied on any type of displacement data provided that the spatial resolution is high enough to resolve local strain variations...|$|R
40|$|A <b>longitudinal</b> <b>daily</b> {{diary method}} was {{employed}} to examine the implications of family assistance for the academic achievement of 563 adolescents (53 % female) from Mexican (n =  217), Chinese (n =   206), and European (n =  140) backgrounds during the high school years (mean age 14. 9  years in 9 th grade to 17. 8  years in 12 th grade). Although changes in family assistance time within individual adolescents were not associated with simultaneous changes in their Grade Point Averages (GPAs), increases in the proportion of days spent helping the family were linked to declines in the GPAs of students from Mexican and Chinese backgrounds. The negative implications of spending more days helping the family among these two groups was not explained by family background factors or changes in study time or school problems. These results suggest that the chronicity rather than the amount of family assistance may be difficult for adolescents from Mexican and Chinese backgrounds...|$|R
40|$|A {{dynamic model}} of how trust regulates {{relationship}} promotion is proposed. The model assumes that trust has both impulsive (i. e., automatic {{attitude toward the}} partner) and reflective (i. e., beliefs about the partner's caring) forms. Because overriding evaluative impulses requires self-regulatory resources, the model further posits that self-regulatory capacity controls whether people strengthen relationship connections {{in the face of}} threats to reflective trust. Two experiments and 1 <b>longitudinal</b> <b>daily</b> diary study utilizing convergent manipulations and measures of self-regulatory capacity supported the model. Results revealed that acute uncertainty about a partner's caring increased relationship-promotive sentiment and behavior when (a) people lacked self-regulatory resources to question impulsively trusting sentiments and (b) when people had self-regulatory resources available to override impulsively distrusting sentiments. In contrast, acute uncertainty about a partner's caring decreased relationship-promotive sentiment and behavior when (a) people lacked the self-regulatory capacity to question impulsively distrusting sentiments and (b) when people had the self-regulatory capacity available to override impulsively trusting sentiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} the reliability of a frame-by-frame cross correlation method of assessing <b>longitudinal</b> sciatic nerve <b>excursion</b> motion using real time ultrasound imaging during a modified passive straight leg raise (SLR) test. Eighteen asymptomatic participants (age range 19 - 68 years) lay on their sides on a purpose made jig and the sciatic nerve in the posterior thigh was imaged during knee extension at 30 ° and then 60 ° of hip flexion (HF). Participants were re-tested ≥ 48 h later. The ultrasound images were analysed off-line using cross correlation software. Results demonstrated excellent repeatability of in vivo sciatic nerve excursion during a modified SLR (HF 30 ° ICC 0. 92, CI 0. 79 - 0. 97, SEM 0. 69; HF 60 ° ICC 0. 96, CI 0. 89 - 0. 99, SEM 0. 87). The authors also identify points of good practise to ensure an accurate as possible measurement of nerve excursion using this method. These include breaking down larger movements into sub-components, visually tracking the moving nerve during the tracking procedure, and ensuring the optimal image is captured prior to analysis. The use of ultrasound imaging in lower limb nerve dysfunction will enhance the understanding of how nerves move in vivo during neurodynamic testing, as well as being able to identify possible alteration to nerve movements in patients with neuropathic pain states...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of {{the study}} Significant efforts {{have been made to}} design {{telemedicine}} systems. But few researchers have taken into account the collection of data and information given from the patients. Yet the clinicians agree {{in the role of the}} “clinical interview” in health status monitoring of chronic patients. Design/methodology/approach The “classic” clinical interview (that can be seen as a face-to-face interview) can be transformed in a virtual medical visit, carried out with ICT tools (as a CAWI). Moreover, in a telemedicine system the questionnaires are collected <b>daily</b> and a <b>longitudinal</b> survey of chronic patients. This innovative approach is a challenge for survey methodologists: at least new data quality measures are needed, and the asssessment of the effectiveness of data collected.
