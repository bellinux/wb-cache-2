25|$|When Capcom {{produced}} the original Street Fighter Alpha in 1995, Guy {{would be one}} of two Final Fight characters {{to be included in the}} game along with the game's second stage boss Sodom. According to Tatsuya Minami, senior manager of Capcom's Product Planning and Design section, Capcom included Guy in the game because he was extremely popular and easy to translate to the one-on-one fighting genre. In this game, Guy's character design was altered slightly, with his jika-tabi replaced by sneakers (a change that was retained when Guy was brought back into the Final Fight series in Final Fight 3), although his fighting style mimics that of his Final Fight counterpart. Guy and Sodom would be joined by Rolento in 1996's Street Fighter Alpha 2 and by Cody in 1998's Street Fighter Alpha 3, followed by Maki's appearance in the portable versions of Alpha 3. Guy's new design would be used in the second Final Fight sequel for the SNES, Final Fight 3 and along with Cody's Street Fighter Alpha rendition, are also hidden characters in Final Fight One (Final Fight for the Game Boy). In the Alpha games, Guy's Bushin predecessor is revealed to be a man named Zeku, who would appear in Guy's ending in Street Fighter Alpha 2 to test <b>Guy</b> <b>for</b> his successor-ship. Zeku's presence in the game contradicts Final Fight 2, which identifies Genryusai as Guy's sensei, as designers of the Alpha games did not take into account the SNES Final Fight sequels when developing the games. Zeku was mentioned once again in Guy's bio in Street Fighter Alpha 3.|$|E
