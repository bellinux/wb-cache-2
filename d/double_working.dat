40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we treat {{the case of}} some {{fundamental}} interval matrix operations, namely the matrix multiplication and the linear system solving. Interval matrix multiplication implemented naively is very slow, compared to optimized floating-point implementations. Rump has proposed] an algorithm based on the midpoint-radius representation, which costs only 4 floating-point matrix products and provides results with an overestimation factor of at most 1. 5. We propose another algorithm to reduce the overestimation factor. This algorithm {{is based on a}} decomposition of the operand matrix into two parts, one which is centered in zero and one which does not contain zero. It uses in total 9 floating-point products. We prove that our algorithm provides results with an overestimation factor less than 1. 18. In some cases, for example when one of the operand matrices does not contain zero in its interior, our algorithm provides results with no overestimation in exact arithmetic. The other fundamental problem addressed in this presentation is to solve a linear system. Many techniques have been proposed in floating-point arithmetic. We have adapted some of these techniques to interval arithmetic in order to solve a linear system {{and at the same time}} certify the solution. The underlying principle of our method is iterative refinement. At the first step, floating-point arithmetic is used to compute an approximate solution to the system. Then we switch to interval arithmetic to compute the residual which helps to refine the error bound using an interval improvement method, namely Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel iterations. This refined error bound serves at the same time as a correction term to the approximate solution, and as the initial value for the next interval improvement. In our method, multiple precision is also employed to increase result accuracy. Classically, <b>double</b> <b>working</b> precision is used for residual computation. <b>Double</b> <b>working</b> precision can also be used to store the approximate solution. First, the working precision is used. Using interval arithmetic, we can easily decide when to switch to the <b>double</b> <b>working</b> precision, that is, when no significant improvement is detected in the error bound. Experimental results show that our method provides results accurate to almost the last bit when the coefficient matrix is not too ill-conditioned. Moreover, we introduce a new technique specific to interval arithmetic, which we shall call the relaxation technique. The nature of this technique is to relax the accuracy on the input while not affecting significantly the result quality, and it helps to increase the performance of the problem. Experimental results show that this technique helps to reduce the execution time significantly without sacrificing accuracy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the field}} of {{scientific}} computing, the exactitude of the calculation is of prime importance. That leads to efforts made to increase the precision of the floating-point algorithms. One of them {{is to increase the}} precision of the floating-point number to double or quadruple the working precision. The building block of these efforts is the error-free transformations. CELL processor is a microprocessor architecture jointly developed by a Sony, Toshiba, and IBM. Although its first major commercial application of Cell was in Sony’s PlayStation 3 game console, it can provide a great potential for scientific computing with a peak single precision performance of 204. 8 Gflop/s. In this paper, we will do the study on how to implement the <b>double</b> <b>working</b> precision library, named single-single, on the SPEs (Synergistic Processing Element), the workhorse processors of the CELL. The methodology of this implementation is based on the paper of Yozo Hida, Xiaoye S. Li, and David H. Bailey, titled ”Algorithms for quad-double precision floating point arithmetic”. To improve the performance, the FPU of the SPE supports only the truncation rounding. So all the floating point operations used in the implementation of the library can only use this rounding mode, which requires to make some modifications to the algorithms. That increases the complexit...|$|E
40|$|Hippocampal {{synaptic}} plasticity {{is believed to}} comprise the cellular basis for spatial learning. Strain-dependent differences in {{synaptic plasticity}} in the CA 1 region have been reported. However, {{it is not known}} whether these differences extend to other synapses within the trisynaptic circuit, although there is evidence for morphological variations within that path. We investigated whether Wistar and Hooded Lister (HL) rat strains express differences in synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus in vivo. We also explored whether they exhibit differences in the ability to engage in spatial learning in an 8 -arm radial maze. Basal synaptic transmission was stable over a 24 h period in both rat strains, and the input-output relationship of both strains was not significantly different. Paired-pulse analysis revealed significantly less paired-pulse facilitation in the Hooded Lister strain when pulses were given 40 - 100 msec apart. Low frequency stimulation at 1 Hz evoked long-term depression (> 24 h) in Wistar and short-term depression ( 24 h) in Wistar, and a transient, significantly smaller potentiation (< 1 h) in HL rats, suggesting that HL rats have higher thresholds for expression of persistent synaptic plasticity. Training for 10 d in an 8 -arm radial maze revealed that HL rats master the working memory task faster than Wistar rats, although both strains show an equivalent performance {{by the end of the}} trial period. HL rats also perform more efficiently in a <b>double</b> <b>working</b> and reference memory task. On the other hand, Wistar rats show better reference memory performance on the final (8 - 10) days of training. Wistar rats were less active and more anxious than HL rats. These data suggest that strain-dependent variations in hippocampal synaptic plasticity occur in different hippocampal synapses. A clear correlation with differences in spatial learning is not evident however...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe CELL {{processor}} [1] jointly {{developed by}} Sony, Toshiba, and IBM provides a {{great potential for}} scientific computing with a peak performance in single precision of 204. 8 Gflop/s. But, this performance is obtained with an SIMD processor which uses single precision floating numbers with a rounding mode toward zero. The goal of our work is to develop extended precision library for this architecture. In this paper, we will study how to implement the <b>double</b> <b>working</b> precision library, named double-single on the SPEs (Synergistic Processing Element) which are the workhorse processors of the CELL. The approach is near from those used in [2] for the quad-double precision arithmetic. Firstly, algorithms based on error free transformations for the operators (+, −, ×, /) are proposed for the rounding mode toward zero. We also prove their exactitude and we provide error limits on the precision of the double-single floating-point arithmetic. The second part {{is devoted to the}} implementation on the SIMD processor by taking into account advantages of the characteristics of the SPE processor, among which the fully pipelined set of instructions in single precision and the FMA (Fused Multiply-Add) operator are the most important. We have managed to implement the error-free transformations very efficiently. In the last part, the performance of our implementation are presented. Even though the theoretic peak performance of the library is much less than the performance of the double precision of the machine, which is about 2. 7 Gflop/s in comparison with the 14. 4 Gflop/s of the double precision, the results of our test show that it is not such that bad. When the 8 SPE are used to compute operations on very large vectors, the performance of the double-single and the true double floating point number are nearly equal. In the future, with the same approach, we will promote our work to the quad-single precision. The quad-double precision will be reached with the next CELL processorwhich will provide a SIMD processor for double precision...|$|E
