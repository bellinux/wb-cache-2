40|$|Objective: {{to perform}} an early {{neonatal}} ultrasound study of <b>intracardiac</b> <b>hemodynamics</b> in premature neonates with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) during mechanical ventilation. Subjects and methods. The paper {{presents the results of}} ultrasound study of <b>intracardiac</b> <b>hemodynamics</b> in 51 premature neonates. Two patient groups were identified. Group 1 comprised 34 infants with severe RDS who received the exogenous surfactant Curosurf and Group 2 consisted of 17 apparently healthy premature newborn infants. Results. Functional tension of the cardiovascular system was characterized for premature neonates with RDS. There were signs of left ventricular systolic dysfunction within the first 24 hours of life and those of right ventricular dysfunction by day 5 of postnatal age. Within 5 days of life, there were echocardiographic signs of pump dysfunction of both ventricles: stroke volume, cardiac index, and blood minute volume. Analysis of changes in peak blood flow velocity and peak pressure gradient across the atrioventricular valves of the right and left ventricles indicated that 17. 6 % of the children showed increases in peak blood flow velocity and tricuspid valve pressure gradient in the systolic phase. The greatest peak blood flow velocity changes were recorded in the pulmonary artery trunk. By day 5 of life, signs of pulmonary hypertension concurrent with hydropericardium remained in 29. 4 % of cases. RDS &# 8211; was shown to be accompanied by higher Qp/Qs ratio in premature neonates. The lower index was attended by the alleviated signs of respiratory failure. In RDS, mainly left-to-right blood shunt was accomplished through the open oval window, but the shunt intensity decreased when the pathological process was resolved in the lung. The functioning patent ductus arteriosus was hemodynami-cally significant in none case. Conclusion. The premature neonates with RDS were found to have intracardiac hemo-dynamic changes. By day 5 of postnatal age, there was no normalization of major intracardiac hemodynamic parameters although respiratory failure resolved in most neonates.

40|$|Abstract Heart failure (HF) is {{a complex}} {{clinical}} syndrome that can result from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs {{the ability of the}} ventricle to fill with or eject blood. Echocardiography represents the "gold standard" in the assessment of LV systolic dysfunction and in the recognition of systolic heart failure, since dilatation of the LV results in alteration of <b>intracardiac</b> geometry and <b>hemodynamics</b> leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The functional mitral regurgitation is a consequence of adverse LV remodelling that occurs with a structurally normal valve and it is a marker of adverse prognosis. Diastolic dysfunction {{plays a major role in}} signs and symptoms of HF and in the risk stratification, and provides prognostic information independently in HF patients and impaired systolic function. Ultrasound lung comets are a simple echographic sign of extravascular lung water, more frequently associated with left ventricular diastolic and/or systolic dysfunction, which can integrate the clinical and pathophysiological information provided by conventional echocardiography and provide a useful information for prognostic stratification of HF patients. Contractile reserve is defined as the difference between values of an index of left ventricular contractility during peak stress and its baseline values and the presence of myocardial viability predicts a favorable outcome. A non-invasive echocardiographic method for the evaluation of force-frequency relationship has been proposed to assess the changes in contractility during stress echo. In conclusion, in HF patients, the evaluation of systolic, diastolic function and myocardial contractile reserve plays a fundamental role in the risk stratification. The highest risk is present in HF patients with a heart that is weak, big, noisy, stiff and wet. </p...|$|R

Research results. We examined 120 patients with coronary heart disease in combination with hypertension aged 44 to 90 years old (mean age 72. 29 ± 1. 66), the majority were men (86. 7 %). All patients {{were divided into two}} groups according to the degree of heart failure: HF 2 A - 54 persons, with HF 2 B - 66 people. The groups were compared in age, gender, functional class of IHD, severity of AH and HF. Analysis of heart ultrasound showed the following. In IHD in combination with hypertension, complicated by HF 2 A, the pressure in the pulmonary artery rises in an average to 46. 46 ± 3. 64 mm Hg and it increases in HF 2 B to 57. 00 ± 5. 19 mm Hg., that corresponding to the average level of pulmonary hypertension (p< 0. 01); at the same time, the fraction of ejection of left ventricle in the first patients decreases moderately up to 45. 96 ± 2. 01 %, in others - to 39. 93 ± 1. 99 % (p ˂ 0. 01).

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} intracardiac hemodynamic idiosyncrasies responsible for various presentations of severe aortic stenosis (AS). BackgroundSyncope, dyspnea, and chest pain are well-established indications for aortic valve replacement in patients with severe AS. Patients' survival is limited once they develop symptoms from AS, and survival depends on what type of symptoms a patient develops. We hypothesized that there would be a relationship between the type of AS symptoms and <b>intracardiac</b> <b>hemodynamics</b> as well as AS severity. MethodsWe analyzed 498 patients (men: 58. 4 %, 66 ± 12 years of age) with severe AS and normal left ventricular ejection fraction from 2003 to 2009 who had comprehensive echocardiography examination for AS. The study population was divided into 4 groups based on presenting symptom(s) (341 in group I, asymptomatic; 15 in group II, syncope; 110 in group III, dyspnea; 32 in group IV, chest pain). Echocardiographic measurements for cardiac structure, function, and intracardiac hemodynamic parameters were compared among these 4 groups. ResultsMean aortic valve pressure gradient and aortic valve area were 57. 1 ± 15. 2 mm Hg and 0. 74 ± 0. 19 cm 2, respectively. AS severity based on mean gradient and aortic valve area was similar among 4 groups. Compared with the asymptomatic group, symptomatic patients were older and had lower cardiac output, and higher E/e' ratio while having a similar aortic valve area and gradient. Group II (syncope) displayed smaller LV dimension, stroke volume, cardiac output, left atrial volume index, and E/e' ratio. Conversely, group III (dyspnea) was found to have the worst diastolic function with largest left atrial volume index and highest E/e' ratio. ConclusionsAmong patients with severe AS, their symptoms are often linked to specific hemodynamic patterns associated with AS: smaller left ventricular cavity and reduced output for syncope versus more advanced diastolic dysfunction for dyspnea. Hence, comprehensive <b>intracardiac</b> <b>hemodynamics</b> including diastolic function and stroke volume need to be evaluated in addition to aortic valve area and pressure gradient for assessment of AS...|$|E

Several adult valve diseases can be backtracked to abnormal valve development, making it imperative to completely understand the process and regulation of heart valve development. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in the development of heart valves. Though hemodynamics is vital to valve development, its role in regulating EMT is still unknown.

The ability to obtain PA pressure from the implant using wireless acoustic communication was examined in 8 pigs and 10 patients with congestive heart failure. Macroscopic and histopathologic examinations were performed at 6 months after implantation. The accuracy of PA pressure measurement was determined by comparison with simultaneous pressures from a Millar catheter.

40|$|AbstractFibrous {{development}} of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of cardiac valves is necessary for proper heart function. Pathological remodeling of valve ECM is observed in both pediatric and adult cardiac disorders. It is well established that <b>intracardiac</b> <b>hemodynamics</b> {{play a significant role}} in the morphogenesis of cardiovascular tissues. However, the mechanisms that transduce mechanical forces into morphogenetic processes are not well understood. Here, we report the {{development of}} a three-dimensional, in vitro culture system that allows for culture of embryonic valve tissue under specific pulsatile flow conditions. This system was used to investigate the role that fluid flow plays in fibrous ECM expression during valve formation and to test the underlying cellular mechanisms that regulate this mechanotransduction. When cultured under pulsatile flow, developing valve tissues upregulated fibrous ECM expression at both the transcript and protein levels in comparison to no-flow controls. Flow-cultured valve tissues also underwent morphological development, as cushions elongated into leaflet-like structures that were absent in no-flow controls. Furthermore, rhoA, a member of the cytoskeletal actin-regulating GTPase family of proteins, was upregulated and activated by flow culture. Inhibition of the downstream rhoA effector kinase, ROCK, blocked flow-driven fibrous ECM accumulation and tissue stiffening, while the addition of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a rhoA activator, stimulated fibrous ECM deposition and tissue stiffening. These results support a prominent role for the rhoA pathway in the mechanotransduction of hemodynamic forces during fibrous remodeling of developing valve tissue. Our results also point to a potential link between regulation of the actinomyosin cytoskeleton and fibrous ECM synthesis in cardiovascular tissues...|$|E

To study the influence of hemodynamics on heart morphogenesis, we used a chick embryo intervention model in which extra-embryonic blood flow can be manipulated. Intracardiac blood flow patterns were altered by a redirection of venous inflow through permanent obstruction of the right vitelline vein with a microclip. We previously showed that this intervention produced {{a specific set of}} cardiac malformations, namely ventricular septal defects, valve anomalies and pharyngeal arch artery malformations (Hogers et al., 1995, 1997). The similarity of these structural cardiac anomalies in the chick embryo to those observed in patients with congenital heart disease argues for the importance of <b>intracardiac</b> <b>hemodynamics</b> as a key epigenetic factor in embryonic cardiogenesis (Hove et al., 2003). We recently demonstrated that venous clipping has major acute effects on hemodynamics in the stage- 17 chick embryo (Stekelenburg-de Vos et al., 2003). For the total study period of 5 ·h, dorsal aortic blood flow remains lower than baseline values, whereas heart rate shows a recovery to baseline within 2 ·h of clipping (Stekelenburg-de Vos et al., 2003). This dramatic reduction in total circulating blood volume after clipping could influence the functional characteristics of the embryonic heart. Since the early developing cardiovascular system is not yet innervated (Pappano, 1977), cardiovascular function is sensitive to mechanisms or interventions that alter hemodynamic load, such as in the venous clip model. In contrast to the mature cardiovascular system, the embryonic heart lacks the ability to acutely alter heart rate to compensate for reduced ventricular preload (Casillas et al., 1994). We therefore hypothesize that the decreased blood volume flow observed in the venous clip embryo would affect ventricular diastolic function. Embryonic diastolic function can be investigated using pulsed-Doppler measurements of blood velocity and flow. The combination of simultaneous atrioventricular and dorsal aorti...|$|E
40|$|We report here {{preliminary}} {{results in the}} development of a computational model in cardiac mechanics which takes into account the coupled effects of ventricular mechanics and <b>intracardiac</b> <b>hemodynamics.</b> In this first work, complex geometrical, architectural and rheological properties of the organ have been strongly simplified in order to propose a “quasi-analytical” model. We assume axisymmetrical geometry of the ventricle and myocardium material to be made of a sheath of a composite, collagenic, fibrous and active muscle medium inside which the blood dynamics is dominated by unsteady inertial effects. Moreover, we have made grossly simplifying assumptions concerning rather stringent and unusual functioning conditions about the mechanical behavior of the input and output valvular and vascular impedances as well as the biochemical action of the fiber. By imposing the time variation of the input and output flow rate and activation function, it is possible, assuming uniformity of the pressure stresses applied to the internal wall surface at every instant of the cardiac cycle, to calculate the overall distribution of fluid pressure and velocity inside the cavity as well as the distributions of stresses and strains inside the wall. It was shown that under the action of a given biochemical activation function, both kinematics of the wall and induced motion of the fluid are such that the boundary conditions concerning normal pressure stresses conservation was constantly satisfied. Moreover, the results concerning the dynamics of the blood flow, as viewed through the human clinical investigations using velocimetric technology based upon color doppler ultrasound, are in accordance with those obtained from such a model, at least during the ejection phase. In particular, contrarily to the filling phase processes, the ejection dynamics is such that the time evolution of the blood velocity measured along the cavity axis does not display any phase shift characterizing an effect similar to a velocity propagation phenomenon. This model reveals to be interesting by its dual point of view permitting to characterize the cardiac performance from both the fluid and envelope kinematics data, given a few number of parameters related to the geometrical and rheological properties of the heart...|$|E
40|$|An unusual case of {{bifurcation}} of {{the left}} superior pulmonary vein (LSPV) just before it enters the pericardium is described. The LSPV, which at the hilus of the lung originated from normal confluence of a superior and inferior root, bifurcated near the left atrium (LAt) of the heart into anterior (AB) and posterior (PB) branches that, separately invaginating the parietal pericardium, formed two individual serous sheaths. The PB coursed almost horizontally and opened, as usual, into the supero-dorsal wall of the LAt. The AB turned downward, reached the superior margin {{of the left}} auricle (LAu) and emptied into it. Thus, the AB was interposed between the pulmonary trunk and the LAt, obstructing {{on the left side}} the communication between the transverse sinus of the pericardium and the pericardial cavity. The auricular opening of the AB was avalvular, but, unlike those of the normal pulmonary veins (PVs) which are surrounded by a large smooth inner surface, was, except for a narrow smooth-walled zone, close to the pectinate muscles. Moreover, an inferior muscular ridge at the inferior margin of its orifice of entrance into the LAu, separated it from the cavity of the LAt. It is well known that in development the PVs arise from convergence of capillaries belonging to the mediastinal part of the primitive splanchnic plexus and drain this into the systemic (cardinal and vitello-umbilical) veins of the embryo. As a consequence, it might be hypothesized that the AB of the LSPV probably represents a partial remnant either of a pulmonary-cardinal anastomotic mediastinal vein, or of a diverging vessel of the mediastinal plexus from which the PVs originate. In either case the AB became absorbed by the LAu, which, while it was developing {{on the left side of}} the primitive truncus arteriosus, drew the AB forward and downward, in the direction of its movement. The influence of such an anomaly of the PVs for altered <b>intracardiac</b> <b>hemodynamics</b> of the oxygenated blood flow has to be emphasized. Furthermore, the particular location of the AB, obstructing the communication between transverse sinus and pericardial cavity, can be a hindrance during cardio-pulmonary surgery...|$|E
40|$|All {{methods for}} {{estimating}} {{the severity of}} heart failure, such as clinical and radiographic examination, measures of ventricular performance, and exercise capacity, when used independently, have major limitations. Echocardiography can be used, not only to assess left-ventricular ejection fraction but also other determinants of prognosis (i. e., left-ventricular size and shape, estimation of left atrial and pulmonary artery pressures, right side involvement). The availability of continuous-wave Doppler has permitted us to evaluate pulmonary artery systolic pressure from tricuspid regurgitation, and this contributes to additional powerful data. In long-standing heart failure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure is a predictor of survival, and aggressive therapy to reduce wedge pressure improves survival. Noninvasive estimation of left-atrial pressure and left-ventricular filling pressure have been attempted by continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography in patients with heart failure and mitral regurgitation and by tissue Doppler imaging at the mitral annulus level. A significant relation has been reported between profiles of pulmonary venous flow and left-atrial pressure, but pulmonary venous flow indexes can be better assessed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in terms of detection rate. It has recently been recognized that TEE can provide valuable information on <b>intracardiac</b> <b>hemodynamics</b> and ventricular function. Two-dimensional evaluation of ventricular function and pulsed- and continuous-wave Doppler recordings from the pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, and mitral inflow are combined to provide these data, which are both qualitative and quantitative, and permit estimation of ventricular ejection fraction, left-atrial pressure, and cardiac output. It would be important {{to be able to}} stratify patients with congestive heart failure according to groups with the highest risk for early death because heart transplantation or aggressive medical treatment could be specifically applied to this population. Serial echocardiographic evaluations of the classic variables of systolic left-ventricular function as well as Doppler transmitral flow may be useful in monitoring the progression of the disease and the effects of medical treatment. The degree of pulmonary hypertension is independently associated with the restrictive left-ventricular diastolic filling pattern and with the degree of functional mitral regurgitation. Future studies on the impact of these hemodynamic variables on the outcome of patients with left-ventricular dysfunction are desirable...|$|E
40|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important problems of modern cardiology all over the world and, particularly, in Ukraine. Implementation of thrombolysis into the treatment leads to significant reduction of mortality from MI. Nowadays the most progressive treatment method is percutaneous coronary intervention. It was proved in several randomized controlled clinical trials (DANAMI- 2, PRAGUE- 2, SIAM-III). But in our country not all centers for treatment of MI are equipped by catheterization laboratory. That is why thrombolytic therapy (TLT) remains actual till today. In any type of treatment tactic in postinfarction heart would be seen remodeling processes with involvement to the pathological process of extracellular morphologic substrate. Pathological changes of extracellular matrix lead to increases of myocardium stiffness and reconstruction of heart chambers geometry. It leads to transformation of spatial organization of heart chambers, violation of blood filling and ejection and formation of systolic and diastolic dysfunction. The synthesis and degradation of extracellular substance is controlled by systems MMP/TIMP, the ratio of which influence on the character of extracellular matrix of myocardium restructuring. Till today influence of TLT on the state of MMP/TIMP system and postinfarction remodeling formation still is not clarified. The purpose of the study - to investigate the influence of thrombolytic therapy on condition of system of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP- 9) and its inhibitors (TIMP- 1), the status of <b>intracardiac</b> <b>hemodynamics,</b> frequency of acute postinfarction left ventricular aneurysm development in patients with Q-wave myocardial infarction. Patients and methods. 116 patients with a diagnosis of acute Q-wave MI of anterior wall of the left ventricle (LV) were examined. Patients, admitted before 12 hours from the beginning of MI and who had no contraindications, received TLT using streptokinase and basic therapy. Patients, admitted later than 12 hours from the beginning of MI or who had contraindications, received basic therapy only, which included statins, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, nitrates by demand. Depending on the implementation of TLT all patients were divided into next groups: the 1 st – 74 patients who received TLT, the 2 nd - 42 patients, who were treated without TLT. All patients were examined by clinical, laboratory and EchoCG methods on the fifth day. Serum levels of matrix metalloproteinases- 9 (MMP- 9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases- 1 (TIMP- 1) were determined. Results and discussion. Analysis of indicators which characterize the MMP/TIMP system showed the lower level of MMP- 9 in patients of the first group. Serum level of TIMP- 1 in the first group was higher in comparison with patients of the second group. During EchoCG in patients of the second group higher than in the first group indexes of end-diastolic diameter of LV, end-systolic diameter of LV, LV myocardial mass index, stroke volume, stroke index, cardiac output, velocity of early diastolic filling of LV, the ratio of the velocity of early diastolic filling and late diastolic filling of LV, average pressure in pulmonic artery, the frequency of left ventricular aneurysm detection and the phenomenon of spontaneous ventricular contrasting were found. Such indexes as ejection fraction, atrial systole flow velocity, deceleration time of early diastolic filling flow and isovolumic relaxation time of LV were lower than in the first group...|$|E
