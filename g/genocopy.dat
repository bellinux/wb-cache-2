50|$|<b>Genocopy</b> is a {{trait that}} is a {{phenotypic}} copy of a genetic trait but {{is caused by a}} different genotype. A genotype at one locus that produces a phenotype that at some levels of resolution is indistinguishable from that produced by another genotype; two types of elliptocytosis that are genocopies of each other, but are distinguished by the fact that one is linked to the Rh blood group locus and the other is not. The way to distinguish a recessive <b>genocopy</b> from a phenotype caused by a different allele would be by carrying out a test cross, breeding the two together, if they F1 Hybrid segregates 1:2:1 then we can determine that it was a <b>genocopy.</b>|$|E
40|$|Huntington’s disease (HD) is an {{autosomal}} dominant, {{progressive and}} fatal neurological disorder {{caused by an}} expansion of CAG repeats in exon- 1 of the huntingtin gene. The encoded poly-glutamine stretch renders mutant huntingtin prone to aggregation. HdhQ 150 mice <b>genocopy</b> a pathogenic repeat (, 150 CAGs) in the endogenous mouse huntingtin gene and model predominantly pre-manifest HD. Treating early is likely important to prevent or delay HD, and HdhQ 150 mice {{may be useful to}} assess therapeutic strategies targeting pre-manifest HD. This requires appropriate markers and here we demonstrate, that pre-symptomatic HdhQ 150 mice show several dramatic mutant huntingtin gene-dose dependent pathological changes including: (i) an increase of neuronal intra-nuclear inclusions (NIIs) in brain, (ii) an increase of extra-nuclear aggregates in dentate gyrus, (iii) a decrease of DARPP 32 protein and (iv) an increase in glial markers of neuroinflammation, which curiously did not correlate with local neuronal mutant huntingtin inclusion-burden. HdhQ 150 mice developed NIIs also in all retinal neuron cell-types, demonstrating that retinal NIIs are not specific to human exon- 1 R 6 HD mouse models. Taken together, the striking and robust mutant huntingtin gene-dose related changes in aggregate-load, DARPP 32 levels and glial activation markers should greatly facilitate future testing of therapeutic strategies in the HdhQ 150 HD mouse model...|$|E
40|$|Aldosterone plays a {{key role}} in {{electrolyte}} balance and blood pressure regulation. Type 1 pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA 1) is a primary form of mineralocorticoid resistance characterized in the newborn by salt wasting, hyperkalemia, and failure to thrive. Inactivating mutations of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR; NR 3 C 2) are responsible for autosomal dominant and some sporadic cases of PHA 1. The question as to whether other genes may be involved in the disease is of major importance because of the potential life-threatening character of the disease, the potential cardiovascular effects of compensatory aldosterone excess, and the role of the mineralocorticoid system in human hypertension. We present the first comprehensive study seeking nucleotide substitutions in coding regions, intron-exon junctions, and untranslated exons, as well as for large deletions. A total of 22 MR gene abnormalities were found in 33 patients. We demonstrate that MR mutations are extremely frequent in PHA 1 patients classified according to aldosterone and potassium levels and give indications for accurate clinical and biological investigation. In our study the possibility of a <b>genocopy</b> exists in three PHA 1 kindreds. The other patients without MR mutations might have different diseases resembling to PHA 1 in the neonatal period, which could be identified by extensive clinical and functional exploration.

40|$|Eco 1 is the acetyltransferase that {{establishes}} sister-chromatid cohesion during DNA replication. A {{budding yeast}} strain with an eco 1 mutation that <b>genocopies</b> Roberts syndrome has reduced ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription and a transcriptional signature of starvation. We show that deleting FOB 1 —a gene that encodes a replication fork-blocking protein specific for the rDNA region— rescues rRNA production and partially rescues transcription genome-wide. Further {{studies show that}} deletion of FOB 1 corrects the genome-wide replication defects, nucleolar structure, and rDNA segregation {{that occur in the}} eco 1 mutant. Our study high-lights that the presence of cohesin at the rDNA locus has a central role in controlling global DNA replication and gene expression...|$|R
40|$|A {{questionnaire}} survey characterized {{a sample of}} 670 probands with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and allied disorders. Segregation analysis provided some evidence for {{a small proportion of}} sporadic cases and for decreased segregation ratios of the dominant and recessive genotypes, which could be attributed to delayed age of onset in some cases. The overall incidence of RP was indirectly calculated to be approximately 1 in 3, 700, while the incidence of autosomal recessive RP, including at least two <b>genocopies,</b> was estimated to be about 1 in 4, 450. Family data analysis included the calculation of the likelihood that each family represented autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, and X-linked inheritance patterns. These likelihoods were then converted to relative probabilities and summed over the sample population to yield estimates of the proportions of the three Mendelian types. This large, heterogeneous sample indicated that approximately 84 % of the cases in the United States may be autosomal recessive, while about 10 % are dominant and 6 % X-linked recessive...|$|R
40|$|Most human gliomas are {{characterized}} by diffuse infiltrative growth in the brain parenchyma. Partly because of this characteristic growth pattern, gliomas are notorious for their poor response to current therapies. Many animal models for human gliomas, however, do not display this diffuse infiltrative growth pattern. Furthermore, {{there is a need}} for glioma models that represent adequate <b>genocopies</b> of different subsets of human gliomas (e. g., oligodendrogliomas). Here, we assessed the intracerebral growth patterns and copy number changes [using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) /comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) ] of 15 human glioma lines in nude mice. Most xenografts present with compact growing lesions intracerebrally. Only the E 98 and, to a lesser degree, E 106 xenograft lines (propagated through subcutaneous growth) consistently produced intracerebral tumors, displaying diffuse infiltrative growth in the brain parenchyma. In contrast, four xenograft lines (E 434, E 468, E 473 and E 478), established by direct intracerebral inoculation of human glioma cells and serially propagated intracerebrally, consistently showed extensive diffuse infiltration throughout the brain. After several passages, the neoplastic cells still carry typical chromosomal aberrations [(- 1 p/- 19 q in oligodendroglioma, + 7 /- 10 in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) ]. Especially these latter four models and the E 98 line thus represent adequate geno- and phenocopies of human gliomas and form an attractive platform to investigate different therapeutic approaches in a preclinical setting...|$|R
40|$|TheDUX 4 gene, encoded within D 4 Z 4 repeats {{on human}} {{chromosome}} 4 q 35, has recently {{emerged as a}} key factor in the pathogenic mechanisms underlying Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). This recognition prompted development of animal models ex-pressing theDUX 4 open reading frame (ORF) alone or embedded within D 4 Z 4 repeats. In the first published model, we used adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) and strong viral control elements (CMV promoter, SV 40 poly A) to demonstrate that theDUX 4 cDNA caused dose-dependent toxicity in mouse muscles. As a follow-up, we designed a second genera-tion of DUX 4 -expressing AAV vectors to more faithfully <b>genocopy</b> the FSHD-permissive D 4 Z 4 repeat region located at 4 q 35. This new vector (called AAV. D 4 Z 4.

Importantly, we further found that aberrant splicing could occur in any expression construct containing a functional splice acceptor and sequences resembling minimal splice donors. Our findings represent an interesting case study with respect to AAV. D 4 Z 4.

40|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{the most}} common inherited cardiac disease. Cardiac imaging {{plays a key role in}} the diagnosis and management, with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) an important modality. CMR provides a number of different techniques in one examination: structure and function, flow imaging and tissue characterisation particularly with the late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) technique. Other techniques include vasodilator perfusion, mapping (especially T 1 mapping and extracellular volume quantification [ECV]) and diffusion-weighted imaging with its potential to detect disarray. Clinically, the uses of CMR are diverse. The imaging must be considered within the context of work-up, particularly the personal and family history, Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram findings. Subtle markers of possible HCM can be identified in genotype positive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) -negative subjects. CMR has particular advantages for assessment of the left ventricle (LV) apex and is able to detect both missed LVH (apical and basal antero-septum), when the echocardiography is normal but the ECG abnormal. CMR is important in distinguishing HCM from both common phenocopies (hypertensive heart disease, athletic adaptation, ageing related changes) and rarer pheno and/or <b>genocopies</b> such as Fabry disease and amyloidosis. For these, in particular the LGE technique and T 1 mapping are very useful with a low T 1 in Fabry’s, and high T 1 and very high ECV in amyloidosis. Moreover, the tissue characterisation that is possible using CMR offers a potential role in patient risk stratification, as scar is a very strong predictor of future heart failure. Scar may also play a role in the prediction of sudden death. CMR is helpful in follow-up assessment, especially after septal alcohol ablation and myomectomy...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{although}} not uniformly accepted that ageing {{is caused by}} time-dependent accumulation of damage. A side effect of ageing is {{an increased risk of}} developing a disease, such as cancer. Yet, the primary molecular target of damage accumulation has remained obscure. A clue has emerged from the notion that human inborn premature ageing syndromes are often associated with mutations in genes involved in DNA metabolism such as nucleotide excision repair (NER). In this thesis, mechanisms of pathological and normal ageing are addressed by <b>genocopying</b> naturally occurring human NER mutants with accelerated ageing and/or cancer phenotype in mouse model systems. Pathological conditions associated with mutations in the XPD and XPB genes, encoding the helicase components of the multifunctional TFIIH complex, range from a dramatic 1000 times elevated cancer predisposition (Xeroderma pigmentosum) to the severe neurodevelopmental premature ageing disorders trichothiodystrophy (TTD) and XP combined with Cockayne syndrome (XPCS). The aim of this thesis is to understand the mechanisms of accelerated ageing and to uncover variables determining the immense clinical heterogeneity ofNER disorders. Chapter 1 introduces the theory of ageing, summarizes clinical consequences ofNER mutations and describes the basic DNA repair mechanims involved. Chapter 2 presents experiments revealing TTD as a progeroid syndrome and defines the crucial role of DNA damage and repair in the rate ofTTD-related ageing. Chapter 3 reveals interallelic complementation between differentially compromised XPD molecules in mice and suggests a new variable in genotype-phenotype relationships within human recessive disease. Chapter 4 shows that CS and TTD share a common root cause in defective DNA repair. Chapter 5 uncovers the widely pleiotropic effects of combining different NER defects with the latent Xp!JXPCS mutation, ranging from moderately enhanced ageing to immediate postnatal lethality. Chapter 6 describes how interallelic complementation can be used for the reconstitution of CS pathology in mice and outlines some potentials for therapy. Chapter 7 reviews all major features of the NER mouse models generated in this thesis and elsewhere and sets forward a model for NER- associated diseas...|$|R
