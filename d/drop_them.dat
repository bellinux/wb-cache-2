5|$|Money Inc. feuded with The Steiner Brothers in {{the spring}} of 1993. At the 1993 King of the Ring, The Steiner Brothers and The Smokin' Gunns {{defeated}} Money Inc. and The Headshrinkers in an 8-man tag team match. The following day, June 14, 1993, the Steiners defeated Money Inc. for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Two days later, Money Inc. regained the titles, only to <b>drop</b> <b>them</b> back to the Steiners three days later. Although Money Inc. received several rematches, they were unable to win the belts back from the Steiners.|$|E
5|$|The player {{constructs}} {{and manages}} a dungeon, recruiting and catering for minions {{to run it}} and defend it from enemy invaders. The primary method of control is the hand, used to pick up creatures and objects in the dungeon, carry them around, and <b>drop</b> <b>them.</b> The hand allows the player to 'slap' creatures and objects, and interact with them. Dungeon Keeper gameplay exemplifies a dark sense of humour.|$|E
5|$|Adventure 2 has {{the health}} system found in many other Sonic games. The player {{collects}} rings scattered throughout the levels; being hit by an enemy while holding rings causes the player to <b>drop</b> <b>them</b> all, while being hit without rings causes them to lose a life. Tails and Eggman have the customary health bar, which is slowly refilled by collecting rings. Dying with no lives results in a game over screen. The characters can obtain permanent upgrades that grant them new abilities; for example, one allows Sonic and Shadow to dash along a sequential trail of rings to reach distant platforms, while another lets Knuckles and Rouge attack powerfully enough to break certain containers. Chaos Drives {{can be used with}} the player's Chao (small, anthropomorphic animals).|$|E
50|$|The correct {{name for}} the two towers are Launch and Drop. The Launch Tower shoots {{passengers}} over 150 ft into the air in 3 seconds and slowly <b>drops</b> <b>them</b> down. The <b>Drop</b> tower launches passengers slowly and <b>drops</b> <b>them</b> in three seconds.|$|R

We knew she carried fourteen boats to our five (we were one short through the desertion of Wainwright), and she began <b>dropping</b> <b>them</b> far to leeward of our last boat, continued <b>dropping</b> <b>them</b> athwart our course, and finished <b>dropping</b> <b>them</b> far to windward of our first weather boat. The hunting, for us, was spoiled. There were no seals behind us, and ahead of us the line of fourteen boats, like a huge broom, swept the herd before it.|$|R

Designed by S&S Worldwide, Scream! shoots riders {{up in the}} air, <b>drops</b> <b>them</b> half of the way, {{brings them}} back up and <b>drops</b> <b>them</b> again. Both rides are nearly 20 stories high.|$|R
5|$|The Konjaku Monogatarishū, a {{collection}} of stories published in the late Heian period, contains {{some of the earliest}} tales of tengu, already characterized as they would be for centuries to come. These tengu are the troublesome opponents of Buddhism, who mislead the pious with false images of the Buddha, carry off monks and <b>drop</b> <b>them</b> in remote places, possess women in an attempt to seduce holy men, rob temples, and endow those who worship them with unholy power. They often disguise themselves as priests or nuns, but their true form seems to be that of a kite.|$|E
5|$|Low's tactics {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} hoisting false colours and approaching an unsuspecting vessel. Off {{the coast of}} St John's, Newfoundland, Low mistook a fully armed man-of-war for a fishing boat, and barely escaped. He moved on to Conception Bay, capturing a number of boats around the Grand Banks southeast of Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic to the Azores. There, he captured a French (or Portuguese—sources differ) pink, a narrow-sterned former man of war, which Low rearmed and refitted as his new flagship, naming it the Rose Pink. He also captured an English vessel with two Portuguese passengers aboard. Low had his crew hoist them up and <b>drop</b> <b>them</b> back down from the yard arm several times, until they died. He {{moved on to the}} Canaries, Cape Verde and then back across to the coast of Brazil, where he was driven back by foul weather.|$|E
5|$|After an enquiry {{into the}} {{problems}} with the airborne missions in Sicily, the British Army and Royal Air Force submitted recommendations in the aftermath of Operation Ladbroke. Aircrew were to be trained in parachute and glider operations, and pathfinders were to be landed before the main force, to set out their beacons. The landing plan was simplified with complete brigades landing on a drop zone, instead of the smaller battalion landing areas used on Sicily. Gliders were no longer released at night while still over water, and their landing zones would be large enough to accommodate the aircraft with room to spare. Following a friendly fire incident over an Allied convoy, more training was given to ship's crews in aircraft recognition; Allied aircraft were also painted with three large white stripes. Training for pilots of the Glider Pilot Regiment was increased, and improvements to the gliders were implemented, including better inter-aircraft communication. To provide another method of delivering jeeps and artillery by air, the Royal Air Force started experimenting with how to use parachutes to <b>drop</b> <b>them</b> into combat, the jeeps and guns being carried in aircraft's bomb bays. A second Royal Air Force transport group, No. 46, was formed and equipped solely with Douglas Dakotas, instead of the mixture of aircraft in No. 38 Group. Together, the Royal Air Force groups were capable of supplying eighty-eight Albermarles, eighty-eight Stirlings, thirty-six Halifaxes and 150 Dakotas, a total of 362 planes which did not include aircraft held as reserves.|$|E

25|$|Despite the charged {{atmosphere}} and warm press, low {{sales for the}} album's singles in Australia prompted EMI to <b>drop</b> <b>them.</b> Plans for a double live album, Bootleg, were also scrapped. Since the band had greater sales overseas than in Australia, they decided to record in a studio abroad and opted for a four-album deal with U.S. label Arista Records in 1987. For Australian releases they signed with Mushroom Records.|$|E

25|$|The {{prosecution}} {{turned to}} the events of the evening of June 12, 1994, where Karen Lee Crawford, the manager of the Mezzaluna restaurant where Brown ate that Sunday night, was called to testify. She recounted that Brown's mother phoned the restaurant at 9:37p.m. about a pair of lost eyeglasses. Crawford found them {{and put them in a}} white envelope. Waiter Goldman left the restaurant at 9:50p.m. after his shift, taking the glasses to <b>drop</b> <b>them</b> off at Brown's house.|$|E

25|$|The {{main effect}} of the battle was unforeseen: the large loss of German {{transport}} aircraft. According to military historian Lt. Col. E.H. Brongers (ret.), {{the loss of the}} transport aircraft had a direct effect on the planning for the proposed German cross channel invasion of Britain. Also, Brongers mentions the impact of the loss of transport aircraft during the invasion of Crete. Since the Germans did not have sufficient aircraft to land troops in force, they had to <b>drop</b> <b>them</b> instead in groups, which resulted in heavy casualties. Brongers' conclusions are supported by military historian Col. Adriaan Hakkert (ret.).|$|E
25|$|A {{short time}} later, Irving privately {{approached}} Penguin {{and offered to}} <b>drop</b> <b>them</b> from his lawsuit if they would pull the book from publication in the UK and destroy all of the remaining copies, publicly disavow all of Lipstadt's conclusions and make a charitable donation of £500 {{in the name of}} Irving's daughter (who is disabled). He also suggested to Penguin that they keep any terms confidential because {{he had no intention of}} settling with Lipstadt. Bays and Bateman made clear that the publisher rejected his terms. Three weeks later, Irving officially offered to settle with both parties, the terms being that the book be withdrawn from circulation, and both parties apologise and (each) make a £500 donation. Lipstadt instructed her lawyers to reject the offer.|$|E
25|$|Amber Lewis' {{sculpture}} {{is similar}} to the readymade in that each component of the artwork is readily available when you step outside (tree and rocks) or can be easily bought at any local hardware store (rope and bucket.) This piece diverts from Duchamp's readymades in that Lewis' sculpture can not be easily moved since it is site specific and is hung from a tree which is immobile. Part of the sculpture is the way the tree changes over time and never looks the same from day to day. The tree from which the bucket hangs is constantly changing with the seasons. In winter the tree has no leaves, but blooms in the spring to eventually create leaves in the summer, only to <b>drop</b> <b>them</b> in the fall.|$|E

50|$|The Trojans {{started the}} season ranked #4, and they won their {{first four games}} to rise to #1 in the polls before a matchup with #7 Alabama at home. A 21-20 loss <b>dropped</b> <b>them</b> to #6, and they responded with a win over Oregon. But losses to #11 Notre Dame and California <b>dropped</b> <b>them</b> to #16. A win over Stanford was soon {{followed}} with a loss to Washington that <b>dropped</b> <b>them</b> out of the rankings, though they did beat #17 UCLA to finish the season strong, albeit tied for 2nd with Stanford in the Pacific-8 Conference. This was their seventh bowl game of the decade. As for Texas A&M, they started the season ranked at #9, and they responded with three victories to rise to #5 in the polls heading into a matchup with #3 Michigan in Ann Arbor. A 41-3 loss <b>dropped</b> <b>them</b> to #13, though they did win their next three games to get to #11 before a game with #8 Arkansas. A 26-20 loss <b>dropped</b> <b>them</b> to #14, though they did beat TCU the next week. A 57-28 loss to #1 Texas killed their hopes for a conference title, though they finished with a 27-7 win over Houston, with a third-place finish in the Southwest Conference. This was their third bowl game in three years, and second in the calendar year of 1977.|$|R

The intention was to <b>drop</b> <b>them</b> over RAF Weston-on-the-Green, after which the aircraft would land at RAF Benson. There were 24 RAF and 11 Army passengers. They included eight RAF parachute jump instructors, three RAF air loadmasters, 13 other members of the RAF, three senior NCOs from the Parachute Regiment (two of them members of the Territorial Army), and seven Parachute Regiment recruits and a Royal Artillery gunner from the Airborne Forces Depot at Aldershot. Two of the instructors were members of the RAF Falcons parachute display team.|$|E
25|$|Personal {{rapid transit}} is an {{automated}} cab service {{that runs on}} rails or a guideway. This is an uncommon mode of transportation (excluding elevators) due {{to the complexity of}} automation. A fully implemented system might provide most of the convenience of individual automobiles with the efficiency of public transit. The crucial innovation is that the automated vehicles carry just a few passengers, turn off the guideway to pick up passengers (permitting other PRT vehicles to continue at full speed), and <b>drop</b> <b>them</b> off to the location of their choice (rather than at a stop). Conventional transit simulations show that PRT might attract many auto users in problematic medium-density urban areas. A number of experimental systems are in progress. One might compare personal rapid transit to the more labor-intensive taxi or paratransit modes of transportation, or to the (by now automated) elevators common in many publicly accessible areas.|$|E
25|$|Prey {{is often}} flushed out of tall grass by the birds stomping on the {{surrounding}} vegetation. It also waits near fires, eating anything it can {{that is trying}} to escape. They can either catch prey by chasing it and striking with the bill and swallowing (usually with small prey), or stamping on prey until it is rendered stunned or unconscious enough to swallow. Larger or dangerous prey, such as venomous snakes, are instead stunned or killed by the bird jumping onto their backs, at which point they will try to snap their necks or backs. There are some reports that, when capturing snakes, the secretary birds will take flight with their prey and then <b>drop</b> <b>them</b> to their death, although this has not been verified. Even with larger prey, food is generally swallowed whole through the birds' considerable gape. Occasionally, like other raptors, they will tear apart prey with their feet before consuming it.|$|E
