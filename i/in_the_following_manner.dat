2500|$|However, it is {{suggested}} that this planetary system evolved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>manner.</b> Planetesimals at the disk's inner edge occasionally pass through gravitational encounters with the outermost giant planet, which change the planetesimals' orbits. The planets scatter the majority of the small icy bodies that they encounter inward, exchanging angular momentum with the scattered objects so that the planets move outwards in response, preserving the angular momentum of the system. These planetesimals then similarly scatter off the next planet they encounter, successively moving the orbits of [...] Uranus, Neptune, and Saturn outwards. Despite the minute movement each exchange of momentum can produce, cumulatively these planetesimal encounters shift (migrate) the orbits of the planets by significant amounts. This process continues until the planetesimals interact with the innermost and most massive giant planet, Jupiter, whose immense gravity sends them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejects them outright from the Solar System. This, in contrast, causes Jupiter to move slightly inward.|$|E

Masking countermeasures can ensure theoretical protection against value-based leakages. However, the practical effectiveness of masking is often halted by physical effects such as glitches and distance-based leakages, which violate the independent leakage assumption (ILA) and result in security order reductions. This paper aims to address this gap between masking theory and practice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> threefold <b>manner.</b> First, we perform an in-depth investigation of the device-specific effects that invalidate ILA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> AVR microcontroller ATMega 163.

Last, we craft the first (to our knowledge) “hardened” 1 st-order ISW-based, masked Sbox implementation, which is capable of resisting 1 st-order, univariate side-channel attacks. Enforcing <b>the</b> ILA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> masked RECTANGLE Sbox requires 1319 clock cycles, i. e. a 15 -fold increase compared to a naive 1 st-order ISW-based implementation.
