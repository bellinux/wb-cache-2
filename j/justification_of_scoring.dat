30|$|Initially, the raters were {{reminded}} of the rating guidelines and how to document the grades. Following this, one essay was distributed. Each individual was required to rate the essay themselves before discussing the ratings with the other five members in their group. Through the group discussion, each group was required to reach a consensus about the ratings for the essay. Each group discussed the scores they had assigned the essay for each rating scale in turn, until {{they came to a}} score for each rating scale that everyone was satisfied with. The facilitator’s role was to keep the discussion moving in a timely manner and ensure that raters were referring to the rating scales in their <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>scores</b> given. As long as the raters referred to the rating scales when justifying their scores, the facilitator would not comment on the actual numeric scores assigned. When a group consensus had been reached, the ratings were reported by each group and documented on the white-board. Once this process was complete, five of the six group members would move to a new group, using a pattern that ensured that each rater never worked with another rater more than once. This process was repeated three more times so that raters had rated and reached a consensus on four sample essays {{by the end of the}} norming session. At the end of the norming session, raters were asked not to discuss their ratings with anyone else during the rating so that they remained consistent in the way they rated.|$|R
40|$|Epistemic scoring {{rules are}} the en vogue tool for <b>justifications</b> <b>of</b> the {{probability}} norm and further norms of rational belief formation. They {{are different in}} kind and application from statistical scoring rules from which they arose. In {{the first part of}} the paper I argue that statistical scoring rules, properly understood, are in principle better suited to justify the probability norm than their epistemic brethren. Furthermore, I give a <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> the probability norm applying statistical scoring rules. In the second part of the paper I give a variety <b>of</b> <b>justifications</b> <b>of</b> norms for rational belief formation employing statistical scoring rules. Furthermore, general properties <b>of</b> statistical <b>scoring</b> rules are investigated. Epistemic scoring rules feature as a useful technical tool for constructing statistical scoring rules...|$|R

40|$|David Boonin has {{recently}} advanced several {{challenges to the}} self-defense <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> punishment. Boonin argues that the self-defense <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> punishment justifies punishing the innocent, justifies disproportionate punishment, cannot account for mitigating excuses, and does not justify intentionally harming offenders as we do when we punish them. In this paper, I argue that the self-defense justification, suitably understood, can avoid all of these problems. To help demonstrate the self-defense theory’s attraction, I also develop some contrasts between the self-defense justification, Warren Quinn’s better known ‘auto-retaliator’ argument, and desert-based <b>justifications</b> <b>of</b> punishment. In sum, I show that the self-defense <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> punishment is more resilient than commonly supposed and deserves {{to be taken seriously}} as a <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> punishment...|$|R
