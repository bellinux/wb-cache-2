5|$|On that night, Lee maneuvered {{the small}} craft {{out to the}} anchorage. It took two hours to reach his destination, as it was hard work {{manipulating}} the <b>hand-operated</b> controls and foot pedals to propel the submersible into position. Adding to his difficulties was a fairly strong current and the darkness creeping overhead, which made visibility difficult.|$|E
5|$|Eighteenth century {{scientific}} laboratories usually contained {{some form}} of <b>hand-operated</b> electrostatic machine. Italian scientist Luigi Galvani had an electrostatic generator in his laboratory, where experiments with frog legs led {{to the discovery of}} animal electricity. Another Italian scientist, Alessandro Volta, disagreed with some of Galvani's ideas, and this scientific argument motivated Volta to develop the first frog-free galvanic cell, and led directly to the invention of the first practical electric battery, the voltaic pile.|$|E
5|$|The spans were {{assembled}} on site. Staging {{was laid}} and rails {{put in place}} to carry a travelling crane. The long beams were hoisted in place first, followed by the vertical bracings, and then the outer and inner plates of the top chordal trusses and the diagonals. The whole structure was bolted together at first, and later riveted by blacksmiths using <b>hand-operated</b> forges. Some individual spans were completed within a week, with contractors being complimented on the efficiency of their work.|$|E
5|$|Aurion {{takes its}} doors, windows, roof panels, body sides (except front quarters) from the Camry XV40. However, the other panels are unique {{from the regular}} Camry. This {{component}} sharing also means that Aurion has the same wheelbase, front and rear axle tracks, and interior dimensions. Interior design also largely parallels the Camry. Notable differences include the redesigned upper dashboard portion and restyled centre console, plus the substitution of the Australian Camry's <b>hand-operated</b> parking brake with a foot-operated equivalent (as shared with the Camry for Japan and North America). The reasoning behind this component sharing strategy was to reduce costs and to allow the car to be built alongside the Camry, thus simplifying the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|Die casting {{equipment}} {{was invented in}} 1838 {{for the purpose of}} producing movable type for the printing industry. The first die casting-related patent was granted in 1849 for a small <b>hand-operated</b> machine for the purpose of mechanized printing type production. In 1885 Otto Mergenthaler invented the linotype machine, an automated type-casting device which became the prominent type of equipment in the publishing industry. The Soss die-casting machine, manufactured in Brooklyn, NY, was the first machine to be sold in the open market in North America. Other applications grew rapidly, with die casting facilitating the growth of consumer goods and appliances by making affordable the production of intricate parts in high volumes. In 1966, General Motors released the Acurad process.|$|E
5|$|In the firstpractice session, Hill was fastest {{with a time}} of 1:21.664, twothousands of {{a second}} ahead of {{teammate}} Coulthard. Schumacher was third, with the Ferrari cars of Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger, who had been the leading two for most session, close behind. Blundell in the McLaren was sixth, with teammate Häkkinen finishing the session in 14th position, the Finnish driver complaining of steering problems with the car. The two Ferrari drivers used different pedal layouts in the 412T2 chassis: Berger's car was equipped with two pedals and a <b>hand-operated</b> clutch, whereas Alesi preferred the traditional three-pedal system.|$|E
5|$|The Hampshire Review {{newspaper}} {{occupied the}} building's second floor with its offices and printing plant from 1884 to 1895. John J. Cornwell, {{who later became}} West Virginia's governor, and his brother William B. Cornwell purchased the newspaper in 1890. The newspaper continued to operate from {{the second floor of}} the Wirgman Building until 1895, when the Cornwell brothers relocated the Hampshire Review office and printing plant to the first floor of their new brick building on West Main Street. In the newspaper's printing plant on {{the second floor of the}} Wirgman Building, the Hampshire Review was printed by a <b>hand-operated</b> Benjamin Franklin printing press.|$|E
5|$|The ships' 37mm 83-calibre {{guns were}} twin mounted {{and placed in}} the superstructure. The mounts were <b>hand-operated</b> and {{automatically}} stabilised for roll and pitch. These guns were supplied with a total of 32,000rounds of ammunition. Bismarck and Tirpitz were initially armed with twelve 20mm guns in single mounts, though these were augmented over time. Bismarck received a pair of quadruple gun mountings, for a total of twenty 20mm guns. Over the course of her career, Tirpitzs 20mm battery was increased to 78 guns in single and quadruple mountings.|$|E
5|$|The District Railway ordered 60 x 7-car {{electric}} {{trains in}} 1903. A {{third of the}} vehicles were made in England, the rest in Belgium and France and electrical equipment was installed on arrival at Ealing Common Works. Access was by sliding doors, double doors in the centre and single doors at either end. First and third class accommodation were provided in open saloons with electric lighting. The seats were covered with rattan in third class and plush in first. From 1906 the standard formation was six cars, with {{an equal number of}} motor and trailer cars running in either two or four car formations off-peak. By 1910 the District required additional rolling stock and ordered cars largely constructed of steel. The first batch arrived in 1911, followed by more in 1912 from a different manufacturer but to a similar design. Further cars arrived in 1914 with an elliptical roof instead of the clerestory roof on the earlier designs. In 1920 the District took delivery of new cars, incompatible with the existing fleet, with three <b>hand-operated</b> double sliding doors on each side.|$|E
25|$|With <b>hand-operated</b> brakes, {{force is}} applied to brake levers mounted on the {{handlebars}} and transmitted via Bowden cables or hydraulic lines to the friction pads, which apply pressure to the braking surface, causing friction which slows the bicycle down. A rear hub brake may be either <b>hand-operated</b> or pedal-actuated, as in the back pedal coaster brakes which were popular in North America until the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|There was {{a little}} ten-ton {{breakdown}} crane, and several (at least four) <b>hand-operated</b> pump trucks for the permanent way staff to use. Two were noted at Eastry, and two at Wingham. Miller trucks (the L-shaped things with two wheels) were noted at Eastry and Staple.|$|E
25|$|An eyelash curler is a <b>hand-operated</b> {{mechanical}} device for curling eyelashes for cosmetic purposes. The earliest patent for an eyelash curler was filed on August 15, 1929 and issued to William E. McDonell and Charles W. Stickel of Rochester, New York on April 7, 1931.|$|E
25|$|The {{silk fabric}} is soaked in {{extremely}} {{cold water and}} bleached before dyeing to remove the natural yellow coloring of Thai silk yarn. To do this, skeins of silk thread are immersed in large tubs of hydrogen peroxide. Once washed and dried, the silk is woven on a traditional <b>hand-operated</b> loom.|$|E
25|$|Carriage house: The former {{carriage}} house and stable {{now serves as}} the center's maintenance building. The building contained an apartment {{on the second floor}} for the carriage drivers and stable help. An automatic carriage wash in the middle bay and a <b>hand-operated</b> large equipment elevator in the carriage section are evidence of the modern conveniences of the time.|$|E
25|$|From March 1934, the {{aircraft}} were revised with a semi-enclosed cockpit {{and a number}} of other modifications before they received the revised designation BFC-2 in recognition of their fighter-bomber or, as the Navy would have it, bomber-fighter role The last aircraft in the XF11C-2 contract was converted to the prototype XF11C-3, incorporating a more powerful R-1820-80 engine and a <b>hand-operated</b> retractable landing gear.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, Japanese {{electronic}} {{musical instruments}} began {{having an impact}} on the international music industry. Ikutaro Kakehashi, who founded Ace Tone in 1960, invented the first electronic drum. At NAMM 1964, he revealed it as the R-1 Rhythm Ace, a <b>hand-operated</b> percussion device that played electronic drum sounds manually as the user pushed buttons, in a similar fashion to modern electronic drum pads.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture began almost 10,000 {{years ago}} in several regions of modern-day China. The {{earliest}} domesticated crops were millet {{in the north and}} rice in the south. Some Neolithic cultures produced textiles with <b>hand-operated</b> spindle-whorls as early as 5000. The earliest discovered silk remains date to the early third millennium. By Northern China's Longshan culture (3rd millennium), a large number of communities with stratified social structures had emerged.|$|E
25|$|The {{progressive}} improvement in canning stimulated the 1855 {{invention of the}} can opener. Robert Yeates, a cutlery and surgical instrument maker of Trafalgar Place West, Hackney Road, Middlesex, UK, devised a claw-ended can opener with a <b>hand-operated</b> tool that haggled its way {{around the top of}} metal cans. In 1858, another lever-type opener of a more complex shape was patented in the United States by Ezra Warner of Waterbury, Connecticut.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hand-operated</b> mule was a {{breakthrough}} in yarn production and the machines were copied by Samuel Slater, who founded the cotton industry in Rhode Island. Development over the next {{century and a half}} led to an automatic mule and to finer and stronger yarn. The ring frame, originating in New England in the 1820s, was little used in Lancashire until the 1890s. It required more energy and could not produce the finest counts.|$|E
25|$|Further {{innovations}} increased {{comfort and}} {{ushered in a}} second bicycle craze, the 1890s Golden Age of Bicycles. In 1888, Scotsman John Boyd Dunlop introduced the first practical pneumatic tire, which soon became universal. Soon after, the rear freewheel was developed, enabling the rider to coast. This refinement led to the 1890s invention of coaster brakes. Dérailleur gears and <b>hand-operated</b> Bowden cable-pull brakes were also developed during these years, but were only slowly adopted by casual riders.|$|E
25|$|The {{caissons}} were counterbalanced, the ascending caisson and the descending operating together. At {{the top of}} the incline, the caisson {{was brought}} close {{to the end of the}} upper canal reach; it was then forced close to it by <b>hand-operated</b> screw jacks to obtain a water seal, and two guillotine gates, at the end of the caisson and at the end of the canal respectively, were opened. At the bottom, the caisson simply descended into the lower canal reach and became immersed.|$|E
25|$|At {{the dawn}} of the Industrial Revolution, the {{mechanics}} of the <b>hand-operated</b> Gutenberg-style press were still essentially unchanged, although new materials in its construction, amongst other innovations, had gradually improved its printing efficiency. By 1800, Lord Stanhope had built a press completely from cast iron which reduced the force required by 90%, while doubling the size of the printed area. With a capacity of 480 pages per hour, it doubled the output of the old style press. Nonetheless, the limitations inherent to the traditional method of printing became obvious.|$|E
25|$|Bronze Age Lusatian rural {{settlements}} {{were limited}} to low-lying areas and until late in this period lacked fortifications or other defensive measures; during these more peaceful times protection was not as essential as in the centuries to follow. The houses were made of beams insulated by clay or moss, supported by poles, with slanting roofs covered by straw or reed. Inside there were hearths, stools, beds, places for economic activity such as metallurgical production shops, vertical looms and <b>hand-operated</b> mills. Some livestock were also kept inside, and some were culled before winter because of insufficient ability to store feed.|$|E
25|$|Professional-level timpani {{use either}} the ratchet or {{friction}} system and have copper bowls. These drums can {{have one of}} two styles of pedals. The Dresden pedal is attached at the side nearest the timpanist and is operated by ankle motion. A Berlin-style pedal is attached {{by means of a}} long arm to {{the opposite side of the}} timpani, and the timpanist must use his entire leg to adjust the pitch. In addition to a pedal, high-end instruments have a <b>hand-operated</b> fine-tuner, which allows the timpanist to make minute pitch adjustments. The pedal is on either the left or right side of the drum depending on where it is set up.|$|E
25|$|Passenger yards are at Long Branch and Bay Head. Long Branch Yard {{is fully}} electrified, and mostly interlocked. Bay Head {{contains}} a large balloon (circular looping) track where entire trains can reverse direction without backing up or uncoupling the locomotive, and obviating {{the need for}} a turntable. It remains in service, even though push-pull operation has eliminated the need for turning of trains. Bay Head Yard has no interlocking; all switches are <b>hand-operated.</b> A yard and sidings formerly existed at South Amboy, dating back to when electrification ended there, but have been removed; trains terminating at South Amboy can be bypassed by using the other track, as the new station has a single island platform.|$|E
25|$|In Renaissance Europe, {{the arrival}} of {{mechanical}} movable type printing introduced the era of mass communication, which permanently altered the structure of society. The relatively unrestricted circulation of information and (revolutionary) ideas transcended borders, captured the masses in the Reformation and threatened the power of political and religious authorities. The sharp increase in literacy broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging middle class. Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of its peoples led {{to the rise of}} proto-nationalism, and accelerated by the development of European vernacular languages, to the detriment of Latin's status as lingua franca. In the 19th century, the replacement of the <b>hand-operated</b> Gutenberg-style press by steam-powered rotary presses allowed printing on an industrial scale.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem of}} {{organizing}} for protection against fire {{was not given}} much thought until 1874, when A.C. Young {{and a group of}} associates organized a hook and ladder company. Young was given City Council authorization to contract for a hand-drawn hook and ladder truck. The Council approved $450 toward the purchase of the new truck. It was built locally by M.A. Jones, and Huntington's first fire company was born. In 1874, the city council enacted an ordinance creating a fire department to consist of an Engine Company, a Hose Company, and the previously formed Hook & Ladder Company. Mr. S. Sexton was named fire chief, and the personnel was all volunteer. in May 1875 the city purchased a <b>hand-operated</b> engine and a hand-drawn hose reel from Portsmouth, Ohio, for $725. To provide a water supply for the department, large 500 gallon cisterns were made in numerous locations in the city. On August 5, 1875, the organization was complete and the department was ready for action. A tower bell for alarms was bought in 1875 and more cisterns were placed in 1876.|$|E
25|$|The {{newspaper}} {{began in}} 1879. According to a 1993 article by Dr. William Lawbaugh in The Mountain Briefing, the first issues were printed on a <b>hand-operated</b> press by Professor Ernest Lagarde from his home. Early {{issues of the}} newspaper were four pages long and reported on education, sports, and significant campus events. The issues also included articles {{on the history of}} Mount St. Mary's, poetry and literary works, death notices, alumni news, and personal and other advertisements. The Mountain Echo ceased publication after several years, but was revived on October 28, 1923, when Volume I, Number 1 was published. The Echo has been in continuous publication since then. The Mountain Echo was restructured during the academic year 1974-75, and was renamed The Mountain Review. The name was changed back to The Mountain Echo the following year. By the 1995/96 academic year, The Mountain Echo was printing a 24-page issue on a biweekly schedule. That year the newspaper expanded into two other formats. Echo Online was the first incarnation of The Mountain Echo website. And Echo Weekly News with Vince Chesney was a radio show hosted by the newspaper's editor-in-chief on the college radio station, WMTB.|$|E
25|$|The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) {{had taken}} over the L railway's service from Earl's Court and by the Second World War this had been cut back to an {{electric}} Earl's Court to Willesden Junction shuttle. Following bombing of the West London Line in 1940 the LMS and the Metropolitan line services over the West London Line were both suspended. This left the Olympia exhibition centre without a railway service, so after the war the Kensington Addison Road station was renamed Kensington (Olympia) and served by a District line shuttle from Earl's Court. R Stock, composed of new cars and the Q Stock trailers that had been built in 1938, replaced the trains with <b>hand-operated</b> sliding doors that remained. The new trains were built between 1949 and 1959, and after 1952 trains were constructed from aluminium, saving weight. One train was left unpainted as an experiment and considered a success, so between 1963–68 trains were left unpainted or painted white or grey to match. The transfer of CO/CP Stock from the Metropolitan line in the early 1960s allowed some of the Q stock to be scrapped. The slow tracks on the former LT line to Upminster were shared with steam locomotive hauled goods and passenger services, until 1961 when the District took over exclusive use of the DC electrified lines.|$|E
500|$|One of Worsley's early {{industries}} was weaving. [...] A cottage industry, cotton {{would be}} spun on spinning wheels and <b>hand-operated</b> looms in people's homes to produce cloth. Merchants would then purchase this cloth, selling {{it at the}} Bridgewater Hotel, then known as the Old Grapes Inn.|$|E
500|$|Medieval blast {{furnaces}} were about [...] tall {{and made of}} fireproof brick; forced air was usually provided by <b>hand-operated</b> bellows. Modern {{blast furnaces}} have grown much bigger, with hearths fourteen meters in diameter {{that allow them to}} produce thousands of tons of iron each day, but essentially operate {{in much the same way}} as they did during medieval times.|$|E
500|$|Compressed earth blocks (CEB) were {{traditionally}} made {{by using}} a stick to ram soil into a wooden mold. Today they are usually made from subsoil compressed in a <b>hand-operated</b> or powered machine. In the developing world, manual machines can be a cost-effective solution for making uniform building blocks, while the more complex and expensive motorized machines {{are less likely to}} be appropriate.|$|E
500|$|Lüft-ü Celil and Hifz-ur Rahman were {{seagoing}} monitors {{armed with}} a battery of two [...] muzzle loading Armstrong guns and two [...] Armstrong guns, each pair mounted in a revolving gun turret, {{both of which were}} on the centerline. The 225mm guns were placed in the forward turret and the turret for the 178mm guns was located aft of the main mast. The turrets were <b>hand-operated.</b> In 1875, both ships received a single [...] gun manufactured by Krupp. In 18911894, Hifz-ur Rahman was partially rearmed. The two 225mm guns were replaced with a pair [...] Krupp guns, and four [...] Hotchkiss guns and two [...] Nordenfelt guns were added.|$|E
500|$|It was {{originally}} intended that Coalhouse Fort would be armed with 68-pdr. smooth-bore guns, but these had become obsolete {{by the time}} it was completed in 1874. More powerful armour-piercing weapons were required, so the casemates were provided with four 12.5-inch and thirteen 11-inch RMLs with a range of about [...] A further three 9-inch RMLs were emplaced in the open battery. They were mounted on metal traversing platforms that could be elevated and traversed using <b>hand-operated</b> gearing devices. Operating the guns presented significant challenges; the 12.5-inch RMLs weighed up to [...] apiece, used a charge weighing [...] to fire a shell weighing [...] to their maximum range, and broke windows half a mile away when they were fired. The detonations and clouds of choking black smoke generated when firing them presented a serious physical hazard to the gun crews.|$|E
