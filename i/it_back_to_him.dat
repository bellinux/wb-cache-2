May bought Moore's Selsey home in 2008, leasing <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for a peppercorn rent the same day to provide financial security. May, Moore and Chris Lintott co-wrote a book Bang! The Complete History of the Universe. In February 2011, Moore completed (with Robin Rees and Iain Nicolson) his comprehensive Patrick Moore's Data Book of Astronomy for Cambridge University Press. In 1986 he was identified as the co-author of a book published in 1954 called Flying Saucer from Mars, attributed to Cedric Allingham, which was intended as a money-making venture and practical joke on UFO believers; Moore never admitted his involvement. He once joined the Flat Earth Society as an ironic joke.|$|E

Snow comes to Charming's rescue by using fairy dust to turn the trolls into bugs. Charming is surprised that Snow saved him, but she wants to repay him for saving her life.

5|$|Mark's ex-girlfriend, Lana Turnboldt, has {{a picnic}} with her fiancé at the secluded {{place in the}} mountains, where they {{discover}} Mr. Griffin's medicine bottle. The police investigate, and find Mr. Griffin's body buried nearby. However, police do not find the ring Mr. Griffin was wearing when he died as David had taken it. Irma Ruggles, David's paternal grandmother who lives with him, discovers the ring and refuses to give <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> believing the ring {{to be that of}} David's father who had left him. David tells Susan he took the ring and his grandmother found it, but they are unsuccessful at retrieving it from her, so Susan tells Mark about the situation because she feels he would know what to do. Irma Ruggles is later murdered, and a neighbor refers to the suspect as a boy in a brown sweater. Susan makes the connection, knowing that Mark has a brown sweater he wears all the time, and that Mark would stop at nothing to get what he needed – in this case, the ring.|$|E

Milan responded with two low {{attempts}} on the Liverpool goal, but Jamie Carragher was able to clear them both. The second clearance led to a corner, from which Milan failed to score. Liverpool had the first chance of the match in the ninth minute. A slip from Milan defender Marek Jankulovski allowed Pennant to run into space, he passed the ball to Dirk Kuyt who passed <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> Pennant's subsequent shot was saved by Milan goalkeeper Dida. Minutes later Gerrard won a header which found Pennant, however Gerrard was unable to make decent contact with the ball following Pennant's pass. Milan had their first shot of the match a few minutes later. Kaká received the ball outside the area and moved to his right before shooting, however Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina saved the shot. Liverpool continued to exert pressure leading Milan defender Massimo Oddo to mis-read a cross from Pennant, the ball reached Gerrard whose shot went over the goal.|$|E

25|$|The eighth {{match of}} the NatWest Series {{eventually}} became an anti-climax, but for {{large parts of}} the match it wasn't – despite the fact that both teams had qualified for the final before the last game. Ricky Ponting won the toss and chose to send his openers in – and they took advantage. Darren Gough was innocuous, conceding 23 runs in his first two overs, prompting a bowling change in the fifth over, sending Steve Harmison on. Meanwhile, Simon Jones got some swing with the new ball – and, yet again in this series, Adam Gilchrist was caught behind off a swing bowler, out for 19. Shortly afterwards, Jones tried to throw the ball back at the wicketkeeper as Matthew Hayden pushed <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> but Jones hit Hayden with the balls, and a few words were exchanged – Paul Collingwood joining in the fray as well.|$|E
25|$|The three suns {{begin to}} align as the Gelflings reach the Crystal's chamber and the Skeksis gather for the ritual that will grant them immortality.

Jen inserts the shard into the Crystal, unifying it as the Mystics enter the chamber and the castle's dark walls crumble away to reveal a structure of bright crystal. Before Jen's eyes, the Mystics and Skeksis merge into tall glowing beings, known as urSkeks. The leader of the urSkeks explains that they had mistakenly shattered the Crystal long ago, splitting them into two races and decimating Thra, but Jen, in fulfilling the prophecy, has restored them. The urSkeks revive Kira in gratitude for Jen's heroism, and then ascend {{to a higher level}} of existence, leaving the Crystal to the Gelflings on the now-rejuvenated Thra.|$|E

[...] As time passed, Anning's confidence in her knowledge grew, and in 1839 she wrote to the Magazine of Natural History to question the claim made in an article, that a recently discovered fossil of the prehistoric shark Hybodus represented a new genus, as an error since she had discovered the existence of fossil sharks with both straight and hooked teeth many years ago. The extract from the letter that the magazine printed was the only writing of Anning's published in the scientific literature during her lifetime. Some personal letters written by her, such as her correspondence with Frances Augusta Bell, were published while she was alive, however.|$|E

[...] "What I Did" [...] includes several elements that are reused in [...] "Blink", including messages under the wallpaper and an ontological paradox involving a conversation between Sally and the Doctor, prerecorded on a video cassette, based on a written transcript—the essay itself; however, instead of the Angels, [...] "What I Did" [...] features the Doctor and the TARDIS inadvertently separated twenty years in time by a fault in the time machine, and the Doctor is able to instruct Sally how to bring <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in the past.|$|E
