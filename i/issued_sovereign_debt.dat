This type of contracts could improve risk sharing between debtor countries and international creditors and diminish the probability of occurrence of debt crises. This paper characterizes the optimal features of real indexed sovereign debt contracts in a dynamic stochastic equilibrium framework with incomplete markets. We show that the optimal indexed debt contract should not be studied abstracting from the total portfolio of assets and liabilities of the issuing country. We also show that the optimal contract is similar to an insurance contract, and that a country can replicate it using existing instruments, in particular, a combination of international reserves and GDP-indexed bonds. Calibrating our model to Argentina’s economy we …nd that the welfare gains from introducing indexed debt and allowing asset accumulation could be equivalent to an increase of between 0. 1 % and 0. 5 % in certainty equivalent aggregate consumption...|$|E

One conclusion is that collective action clauses can allow efficient debt renegotiation in a formal model of <b>sovereign</b> <b>debt</b> renegotiation while unanimity rules offer incentives for opportunistic behavior by bondholders that leads to inefficient outcomes. With collective action clauses, the mutual gains from renegotiation can be internalized by bondholders so that the holders of each bond issue have incentives {{to participate in a}} collective debt restructuring.

We estimate the effects of individual borrower characteristics as well as macroeconomic conditions {{on the cost of}} foreign borrowing and test whether these effects differ across phases of the lending cycle. We find that public and financial institutions benefit from lower spreads compared to private and nonfinancial firms and that lenders may differentiate the risk associated with the borrower’s industrial sector between good and bad times. The loan (bond) rating has an equally robust spread reduction effect across credit cycle phases. The results also suggest that international reserve holdings and investment ratios {{have a significant effect on}} reducing credit spreads for loans, while higher reserve holdings and longer maturities matter more for bond spreads.

40|$|Governments {{around the}} world raise {{significant}} amounts of capital by <b>issuing</b> <b>sovereign</b> bonds in international financial markets. These bonds are typically purchased and traded by foreign investors who seek a profitable return on their investment. The <b>issuing</b> country incurs <b>sovereign</b> <b>debt,</b> which it must repay over a predetermined period of time. Occasionally, sovereigns—typically emerging market governments—become {{unable or unwilling to}} repay their <b>sovereign</b> <b>debt.</b> A country’s ability to repay its debt is difficult to assess given the multitude of nonfinancial factors that affect the assessment. As a result, investors are vulnerable to opportunistic defaults which can deprive them of their investment. Additionally, investors cannot collect on their investment through bankruptcy proceedings because a country cannot declare bankruptcy. The financial markets have responded to this challenge with a variety of contractual mechanisms aimed at facilitating a debt restructuring, which will simultaneously lower the sovereign’s debt burden while ensuring that investors receive payment on their investment. Unfortunately, the contractual mechanisms currently utilized in sovereign bond contracts have proven to be inadequate. This Note begins by explaining <b>sovereign</b> <b>debt</b> and the major problems with the current international sovereign bond market. Next, this Note explores the global community’s various efforts to address these problems thus far and explains why these solutions have proven inadequate.

40|$|At European Union level, {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis intensified the <b>issue</b> of <b>sovereign</b> <b>debts</b> and member states had to implement a series of fiscal measures {{in order to reduce}} the budgetary deficit and public debts, that have peaked in the last decades. These changes were also imposed in the Romanian fiscal system and the effects were felt in particular through increased tax rates or even the introduction of new taxes. 2008 was the year that marked a turning point in the fiscal policy of member states of the European Union from multiple perspectives. The impact of the economic crisis was felt mainly through the drastic decrease in tax revenues for all member states, which led to an accelerated growth of the budgetary deficit and implicitly of the indebtedness degree. In this context, EU member states were forced to adopt measures that would reduce the budgetary deficit (increases in some taxes and reduction of certain public expenditures). In 2010, the <b>sovereign</b> <b>debt</b> crisis in the euro area exposed the weaknesses of the EU economic governance. In response, the so-called "six pack" regulations were introduced in December 2011. Moreover, many countries have intensified their consolidation efforts in an attempt to regain the confidence of financial markets. The new architecture of fiscal policy in the European area has undergone many changes in recent years, market not only by the fiscal harmonization process, but mainly by the temptation of fiscal coordination that aims mainly to achieve fiscal stability and reduce medium and long-term public debt. The excessive growth of countries' indebtedness degree in recent years led to the need to study the sustainability of the indebtedness policy, considering that maintaining the budgetary deficit at a prudent level would also ensure the sustainability of fiscal policy. The study analyzes the effects in budgetary plan of economic recovery measures by highlighting the evolution of public debt in EU member states.

This type of contracts could improve risk sharing between debtor countries and international creditors and diminish the probability of occurrence of debt crises.

Finally, we obtain a quantitative approximation of the welfare effects of indexation.

Existing real indexed contracts usually entail payments increasing in the state of the economy. However, they also feature threshold levels of the chosen real variable that trigger payments. We argue that the latter are usually suboptimal.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{cross-country}} {{differences in the}} underlying volatility and persistence of macroeconomic shocks help explain two historical regularities in sovereign borrowing: the existence of "vicious" circles of borrowing-and-default ("default traps"), {{as well as the}} fact that recalcitrant sovereigns typically face higher interest spreads on future loans rather than outright market exclusion. We do so in a simple model where output persistence is coupled with asymmetric information between borrowers and lenders about the borrower''s output process, implying that a decision to default reveals valuable information to lenders about the borrower''s future output path. Using a broad cross-country database spanning over a century, we provide econometric evidence corroborating the model''s main predictions-namely, that countries with higher output persistence and conditional volatility of transient shocks face higher spreads and thus fall into default traps more easily, whereas higher volatility of permanent output tends to dampen these effects.
