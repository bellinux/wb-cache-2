40|$|Kasser et al. pose an {{important}} and often unaddressed question: how do different institutional forms, or economic systems, shape the ideas, values, beliefs, motivations, and practices of their members or participants. (also see Bowles, 1998). While I applaud their efforts in opening up this line, I offer two concerns. First, Kasser et al. neglected two large-scale comparative projects that directly test their principle hypotheses and arrive at quite different conclusions. Second, much of their evidence involves relationships among variables drawn from samples within one ACC populations, yet their hypotheses seem to demand comparisons among populations with differing <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> ACC <b>institutions.</b> This may have resulted in faulty causal inferences. The authors hypothesize that ACC institutions, collectively forming the capitalist economic system, favor the transmission of cultural representations that promotes self-interest, competition, and materialism, while suppressing the acquisition of representations related to altruism, fairness, cooperation and numerous aspects of psychological well-being. In my view, the proper test of such hypotheses would involve a systematic comparative study, preferably using behavioral measures of self-interest, fairness, etc., from popula-tions with differing degrees of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> ACC <b>institutions.</b> It happens that my colleagues and I, over the last decade, have run two such projects, deploying behavioral experiments among 15 diverse populations drawn {{from some of the}} remotest corners o...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} growth effects of {{historical}} and biological ancestry, diversity and financial development in transition economies. We {{show that the}} common indicators of ethnolinguistic fractionalization, state history and genetic distance yield significant results {{and to some extent}} transform the impact of finance on growth in East-Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. Deep ethnolinguistic cleavages produce insignificant results, whereas at intermediate and lower levels of aggregation diversity is likely to significantly improve the effect of finance on growth. Similarly to finer ethnolinguistic cleavages, genetic distance from the United States also favorably increases the relevance of financial development for growth. However, state history as a proxy for long-run ancestral <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>institutions,</b> political organization and centralization reinforces the negative growth effect of financial development. We argue that financial development is inclined to resolve problems arising from coordination failures and absence of trust in diverse societies by easing liquidity constraints and offering incentives for entrepreneurship to minority groups. In contrast, long state history is likely <b>to</b> generate extractive <b>institutions</b> that facilitate the provision of soft budget constraints. Genetic distance from the United States induces higher reliance on continental rather than Anglo-Saxon financing practices, and therefore increases dependence on banks rather than bonds or equity for external liquidity purposes...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To advance {{understanding}} about the popular health promotion strategies and factors associated with the successful transfer and uptake of health messages among Chinese and Indian immigrant women. Methods: Eight focus groups were conducted with 46 immigrant women, 22 from Mainland China and 24 from India, who had lived less than 5 years in Canada. Audiotaped data were transcribed, translated and analyzed by identification of themes and subcategories within and between groups. Results: In both ethnic groups, discussions on promoting health messages had five major themes, i. e., sources, barriers, facilitators, credibility and ways to improve access along with group specific sub-themes. Despite identification of several diverse sources of health information in the adopted country, Indian and Chinese immigrant women perceived most strategies as not very effective. The reasons of perceived ineffectiveness were barriers to accessing and comprehending the health messages; and limited prior <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>institution</b> based or formal health promotion initiatives. These women were more familiar with informal means of obtaining health information such as social networks, mass media and written materials in their mother tongue. Conclusion: Existing health communication and health promotion models need to be re-orientated from a one-way information flow to a two-way dialogue model {{to bridge the gap}} between program efficacy and effectiveness to reach underserved immigrant women. An “outside the box” approach of non-institutional informal health promotion strategies needs to be tested for the studied groups.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. The issues of {{migration}} and immigrant political integration in western democracies {{have become increasingly}} intertwined with debates on religion, particularly Islam. To date, however, we have surprisingly little systematic research on how religious beliefs are related to immigrants’ political engagement. In this study, we argue that religion has a capacity to mobilize immigrants politically but {{the strength of this}} relationship depends on immigrant generation, religiosity, and the type of religion. Using survey data collected as part of the European Social Survey (ESS) 2002 – 2010 in 18 West European democracies, our analyses reveal that religion is indeed linked to political engagement of immigrants in a complex way: while belonging to a religion is generally associated with less political participation, <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> religious <b>institutions</b> appears <b>to</b> have the opposite effect. Moreover, we find that, compared to foreign-born Muslims, second-generation Muslim immigrants are not only more religious and more politically dissatisfied with their host countries, but also that religiosity is more strongly linked to their political engagement.

The overall theme arising from the data is that the college choice process was complicated and inconsistent; however, ten of the twelve participants completed some type of postsecondary training. Deficient messages about postsecondary education manifested as low parental support for college attendance, low academic expectations, withholding of important information from school officials and little or no <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> postsecondary <b>institution</b> campuses or students.

40|$|In the {{laboratory}} experiment {{reported in this}} paper we explore how evolving institutions and social norms, which we label 'culture', change individuals' preferences and behaviour in mainland China. From 1949 China experienced dramatic changes in its socio-economic institutions. These began with communist central planning and the establishment of new social norms, including the promotion of gender equality in place of the Confucian view of female 'inferiority'. Market-oriented reforms, begun in 1978, helped China achieve unprecedented economic growth {{and at the same time}} Marxist ideology was gradually replaced by the acceptance of individualistic free-market ideology. During this period, many old traditions crept back and as a consequence social norms gradually changed again. In our experiment we investigate gender differences in competitive choices across different birth cohorts of individuals who, during their crucial developmental-age, were exposed to one of the two regimes outlined above. In particular we investigate gender differences in competitive choices for different birth cohorts in Beijing using their counterparts in Taipei (subject to the same original Confucian traditions) to control for the general time trend. Our findings confirm: (i) that females in Beijing are significantly more likely to compete than females from Taipei; (ii) that Beijing females from the 1958 birth cohort are more competitive than their male counterparts as well as more competitive than later Beijing birth cohorts; and (iii) that for Taipei there are no statistically significant differences across cohort or gender in willingness to compete. In summary, our findings confirm that <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> different <b>institutions</b> and social norms during the crucial developmental age changes individuals' behaviour.

Before BSS’s entrance in the villages, Banjeree and collaborators administered to households detailed surveys covering a wide range of interactions, to reconstruct the structure of the social network. When entering a village, BSS selected a number of pre-defined individuals that they would expect to be well connected within the villages (teachers, shopkeepers, leaders of self-help groups, etc), and had a private meeting with them to introduce the microfinance programme. These individuals, hereafter simply called leaders, then played a fundamental role in spreading the information about microcredit opportunities. Banerjee and collaborators investigate the correlation between the village level of participation in microfinance and the average centrality of its leaders in the social network.|$|R

40|$|The higher {{education}} system in South Africa transformed {{over the last}} two decades in response to societal changes and the new democratic order since 1994. Nursing education programmes in South Africa’s {{higher education}} sector were also affected by these changes. Restructuring in nursing education led to the establishment of a novel undergraduate nursing programme delivery system in the Western Cape, known as a “common teaching platform” (CTP) for undergraduate nursing. The CTP necessitated collaboration between three higher education institutions in the region. This article reports the findings of a qualitative study conducted during 2010 to explore students’ experiences of the CTP. The findings could have significance for strategic decisions regarding the future of undergraduate nursing in the Western Cape. Focus group discussions were conducted with registered undergraduate student nurses (n= 81) to explore their CTP experiences and to identify their views on the success of the collaboration. The results of the study revealed students’ positive and negative experiences of the CTP.
