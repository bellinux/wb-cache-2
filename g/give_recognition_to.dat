25|$|For {{the fifth}} {{edition of the}} Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), {{there has been a}} {{tremendous}} amount of debate around whether the sexual and gender identity, which includes the GID, qualifies as a mental disorder. One of the most notable discussions for this occurred in 2003 during the annual APA meeting, where Darryl B. Hill, Ph.D., argued that the GID should not be considered a mental disorder. He explains that due to the limited amount of reliable and valid evidence, given the role of parents and therapies, for whether GID meets the conditions as a mental disorder among children and adolescents. Furthermore, other researchers have stated that the diagnosis does not <b>give</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>to</b> the individual’s discomfort with their biological sex which is completely detached from their gender assignment. This leaves patients susceptible to social changes for what acceptably feminine or masculine. Lastly, it does not provide evidence for nonconformity to traditional gender behaviours which varies between cultures, life stages, genders, and ethnic groups.|$|E

500|$|The Medal of Honor {{was created}} as a Navy version in 1861 named the [...] "Medal of Valor", and an Army version of the medal named the [...] "Medal of Honor" [...] was {{established}} in 1862 to <b>give</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>to</b> men who distinguished themselves [...] "conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity" [...] in combat with {{an enemy of the}} United States. Because the medal is presented [...] "in the name of Congress", it {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "Congressional Medal of Honor". However, the official name is [...] "Medal of Honor", which began with the U.S. Army's version.The Congressional Medal of Honor Society is so designated because that was the name it was given in an act of Congress that was signed into law by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower on August 5, 1958, as Title 36, Chapter 33 of the U.S. Code (see [...] ). The law authorizing the society has since been transferred to Title 36, Chapter 405 of the U.S. Code.

500|$|Because of {{the number}} of men serving in the military, many band {{programs}} opened up to women during this time. At Texas Tech, a local sorority for women in the band was established as Tau Beta Sigma. The women of Tau Beta Sigma petitioned Kappa Kappa Psi to be chartered as an auxiliary chapter of the fraternity, which was supported by founder A. Frank Martin, who was serving as National Executive Secretary, and Max Mitchell, Grand Second Vice President. On January 25, 1944, Martin wrote to fellow founder, William Scroggs, [...] "If we do not meet this new situation and <b>give</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>to</b> the girls who are coming into the bands or make it possible to give aid or assistance to the many universities and colleges that have bands composed of both boys and girls, we will be playing second fiddle {{within the next five years}} to some band fraternity that will grant membership to boys and girls and their chapters will open up in the smaller schools where ours have died." [...] The fraternity was unable to decide whether or not to accept Tau Beta Sigma's petition due to the severely reduced number of members and the cancelation of the 1943 and 1945 national conventions.|$|E
2500|$|Lumina was {{the first}} Aromanian {{magazine}} to be published within the lands of Rumelia (Turkey-in-Europe), and espoused a cultural agenda without political objectives, setting up the first popular library for Aromanian- and Romanian-speakers of Macedonian descent. However, the Association of Educationists stated explicitly that its goal was to elevate the [...] "national and religious sentiment" [...] among [...] "the Romanian people of the Ottoman Empire". Lumina was noted for its better quality, receiving a 2,880 lei grant from Romania's government, but {{was no longer in}} print by late 1908. Following a ban on political activities by Sultan Abdul Hamid II, Batzaria was arrested by local Ottoman officials, and experience which later served him in writing the memoir În închisorile turcești ("In Turkish Prisons").

2500|$|The Mesha stele is {{the longest}} Iron Age {{inscription}} ever found in the region, the major evidence for the Moabite language, and a unique record of military campaigns. The occasion was the erection of a sanctuary for Kemosh in Qarho, the acropolis (citadel) of Dibon, Mesha's capital, in thanks for his aid against Mesha's enemies. Kemosh is credited with {{an important role in}} the victories of Mesha, but is not mentioned in connection with his building activities, reflecting the crucial need to <b>give</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>to</b> the nation's god in the life and death national struggle. The fact that the numerous building projects would have taken years to complete suggests that the inscription was made long after the military campaigns, or at least most of them, and the account of those campaigns reflects a royal ideology which wishes to present the king as the obedient servant of the god. The king also claims to be acting in the national interest by removing Israelite oppression and restoring lost lands, but a close reading of the narrative leaves it unclear whether all the conquered territories were [...] previously Moabite – in three campaign stories there is no explicit reference to prior Moabite control.|$|E
