5|$|In late 1991, Syrian {{authorities}} arrested Nayyouf's {{wife and}} young {{daughter in a}} crackdown on members of the CDF in order to pressure Nayyouf to give <b>himself</b> <b>up.</b> <b>On</b> 10 January 1992, Nayyouf surrendered to authorities. After his arrest, Nayyouf was tortured at the Palestine Branch of Syrian Military Intelligence. Many of Nayyouf's colleagues in the CDF were also arrested, and at least 17 were tried alongside Nayyouf by the Syrian Supreme State Security Court (SSSC) in proceedings lasting from 29 February to 27 March 1992.|$|E
5|$|Manuel is {{mentioned}} {{for the first}} time in 978, when he led the defence of Nicaea against the rebel general Bardas Skleros, who had risen up against Emperor Basil II (reigned 976–1025). Although his great-granddaughter, the princess Anna Komnene, claims in her Alexiad that he had been named strategos autokrator (commander-in-chief) of the East and sent with full powers to deal with the revolt, it is far more likely that he was merely a local commander. Manuel maintained the city's defence with some success, even though the besiegers managed to undermine and collapse one of its towers, until the lack of food became acute. At that point Manuel was able to fool Skleros, by pretending that he had mountains of wheat and was considering joining him, into allowing him and the inhabitants to depart freely for Constantinople. Manuel re-appears in 989, when he was sent as an envoy to Skleros, who had once more risen in revolt against Basil II, to persuade him to surrender. Manuel was successful in his task, and the elderly rebel ended his revolt and gave <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> 11 October. The titles by which he is recorded were patrikios, anthypatos, and vestes.|$|E
25|$|The {{features}} of the earliest attested case, that of a Jewish thief hanged by the feet in Soultzmatt in 1296 are also rather divergent from the rest. The Jew managed, somehow, {{after he had been}} left to die to twitch his body in such a manner that he could hoist <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the gallows and free himself. At that time, his feet were so damaged that he was unable to escape, and when he was discovered 8 days after he had been hanged, he was strangled to death by the townspeople.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} courageous efforts at the SCG was John Sattler's {{performance}} in the 1970 grand final between South Sydney and the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. In the first ten minutes of the game, South's captain Sattler had his jaw broken by a punch from Manly forward John Bucknall in an off-the-ball incident. Sattler went down but pulled <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> teammate Michael Cleary, asking the winger to help him so that the other players would not know he was hurt. In an act of supreme courage Sattler played on, refusing treatment at half time and pleas from teammates {{not to take the}} field again, to lead Souths to a famous 23–12 win. It was not until well after the game that he went to hospital. The Australian side to tour Britain was selected that night and, but for his injury, Sattler would have been picked as captain.|$|E

60|$|He laughed himself, but in {{a strangely}} mirthless fashion, and, afraid to trust <b>himself,</b> went <b>up</b> <b>on</b> deck and brooded savagely apart. Nor did he come down to breakfast until the skipper and cook had finished.|$|R

50|$|A valid {{criticism}} of this interpretation {{is that the}} focus shifts from the aural to the visual as the image of Whitelaw’s mouth dominates the screen and has often been likened to a vagina attempting {{to give birth to}} the self.

60|$|Harry {{had waited}} until he saw {{the work in the}} {{courtyard}} completed; and then, with the interpreter, entered the rajah's house. The room he generally used was empty.

60|$|The room {{in which}} he had shut <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> was <b>on</b> the ground floor, {{at the back of the}} house.

But it had an outlet in a neighbouring street.|$|R
