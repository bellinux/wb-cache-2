25|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>braking</b> {{actually}} predates clutch braking on tracked vehicles, {{having been}} initially introduced by Richard Hornsby & Sons in 1905 on the world's first tracked vehicle. Clutch braking became popular {{only because of}} its mechanical simplicity. <b>Differential</b> <b>braking</b> could be found on many smaller tanks, especially in the pre-World War II era. British tanks began using them during World War I, and continued into World War II. One common example was the Bren Carrier.|$|E
25|$|The {{landing gear}} is of a {{tricycle}} configuration {{with all three}} wheels mounted on steel sprung gear legs. The nosewheel is free castering and the aircraft is steered with <b>differential</b> <b>braking.</b> The brakes are mounted conventionally on the rudder pedal toes.|$|E
25|$|The {{landing gear}} is of {{tricycle}} configuration {{and all three}} sprung gear legs are made from 4130 chrome-molybdenum steel alloy. The nose wheel is free-castering. On early versions the nose wheel steering was by <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> via two finger-controlled brake handles mounted on the centre console. On later versions more conventional toe brakes were installed.|$|E

50|$|The {{undercarriage}} {{consisted of}} a retractable tricycle arrangement with auxiliary skids which could be lowered in case the undercarriage failed to extend. <b>Differential</b> <b>brakes</b> were fitted to the main undercarriage wheels.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to present trends of modern axle trucks. There are presented the latest famous brands axle trucks. For each type has its axle design, driving properties and applicability. Furthermore, this paper describes the basic principles and structure axle’s <b>differentials,</b> <b>brakes,</b> gearboxes and wheels in the wheels...|$|R
25|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>braking</b> (or braked differential) systems {{remove the}} {{clutches}} {{on the track}} and add a differential on the transmission output. The differential allows the tracks to turn at different speeds while remaining powered. Steering is then accomplished by slowing one track with a brake. The advantage to this design is that power is maintained to both tracks even while steering is taking place. Another advantage is outright simplicity; the steering system connects directly to the brake and nothing else, producing a very simple mechanical arrangement.|$|E
25|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>braking</b> {{systems are}} {{essentially}} an epicyclic transmission {{with a single}} fixed gear ratio transmitted through idler pinions. The controlled differential adds an extension to the rack holding the idlers, and puts a conventional brake on that extension. With the brake applied, the idlers are locked and the system works like a conventional epicyclic. When the brake is released, the idlers spin, reducing the speed of rotation on that side. This causes the output on that side to slow down by a fixed amount.|$|E
25|$|The Spitfire Mk 26 is an '80% or 90% scale' (but {{see note}} of scale {{inaccuracies}} in the Variants section below) replica {{based on the}} original Supermarine Spitfire design. Despite its smaller size provision is made for a passenger to be seated in tandem behind the pilot. The stressed skin structure consists of 2024 aluminium alloy skins, formers and longerons with some fibre-glass mouldings for parts such as fairings and air scoops. The design features retractable undercarriage with <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> to the main wheels. The aircraft has {{been approved by the}} British Light Aircraft Association.|$|E
50|$|The Corsa VXR Performance pack adds {{a limited}} slip <b>differential,</b> Brembo <b>brakes,</b> and track-grade suspension.|$|R

50|$|The Potez 42 had fixed, {{tailwheel}} {{landing gear}} with a track of 2.86 m. Each mainwheel {{was on a}} bent axle and a drag strut, both hinged on the lower fuselage longeron and with a vertical, stacked rubber ring shock absorber strut of Potez design to the centre-section forward spar. The wheels had <b>differential</b> <b>brakes</b> for steering, aided by a small, elastically mounted castoring tailwheel.|$|R
25|$|The {{nose wheel}} of the DA20 is not linked to the rudder pedals and turns while taxiing are made with <b>differential</b> <b>braking,</b> with rudder {{steering}} becoming more effective as airspeed increases. The Katana possesses a higher glide ratio than many of its competitors; its glide ratio is 11:1 and the DA20-A1 is 14:1. The aircraft does not feature any instances of vortex generators, wing fences or many other aerodynamic devices, aside from the integral winglets, which positively contribute to roll stability, drag-reduction, and enhanced aileron effectiveness. The Katana's T-tail configuration has also been claimed to reduce {{the negative effects of}} propeller-generated slipstream on the aircraft's pitch control as well as increase low-speed pitch authority.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{prototype}} were three Model A45T aircraft, {{the first two}} with the same engine as {{the prototype}} and the third with a Continental E-225, which {{would prove to be}} close to the production version. Production did not begin until 1953, when Beechcraft began delivering T-34As to the United States Air Force (USAF) and similar Model B45 aircraft for export. Production of the T-34B for the United States Navy (USN) began in 1955, this version featuring a number of changes reflecting the different requirements of the two services. The T-34B had only <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> for steering control on the ground instead of nosewheel steering, additional wing dihedral and, to cater for the different heights of pilots, adjustable rudder pedals instead of the moveable seats of the T-34A. T-34A production was completed in 1956, with T-34Bs being built until October 1957 and licensed B45 versions built in Canada (125 manufactured by Canadian Car and Foundry), Japan (173 built by Fuji Heavy Industries), and Argentina (75 by FMA) until 1958. Beechcraft delivered the last Model B45s in 1959. Total production of the Continental-engined versions in the US and abroad was 1,904 aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|The SR22, {{certified}} in November 2000, {{is a more}} powerful version of the earlier SR20. The SR22 is a low-wing cantilever monoplane of composite construction, featuring fixed (non-retractable) tricycle landing gear with a castering nose wheel and steering via <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> on the main wheels. It {{is powered by a}} nose-mounted 310hp (231kW) Continental IO-550-N [...] piston engine. The four-seat cabin is accessed through doors {{on either side of the}} fuselage.|$|E
50|$|European engine options {{remain the}} same as for the 2011 Passat CC. Transmission options were carried over from the {{previous}} version, but the diesel automatic transmission now has with a free-wheel function that is claimed to reduce fuel consumption by disengaging the clutch when the driver lifts their foot from the accelerator. The XDS electronic <b>differential</b> <b>brake</b> also used in the Golf GTI will be available as standard and optional equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Modified US 105mm M7 Priest Self-Propelling Guns: [...] "modifications {{included}} {{the removal of}} the 105 mm gun, mount and mantelet (which led to the sobriquet [...] "defrocked Priests," [...] later replaced by [...] "Kangaroos"), overhauling the radial engine, checking the serviceability of the transmission and the controlled <b>differential</b> <b>brake</b> lining and running gear. … Armour plate was placed over the gun mantelet opening and added to the vehicle sides." ...|$|R
50|$|The tail was conventional, with a near {{triangular}} fin {{and straight}} edged rudder. The NiD 590's tailplane was straight tapered and mounted {{on top of}} the fuselage. Its undercarriage was fixed, its mainwheels on bent axles with streamlined drag struts and short, vertical oleo struts to the forward engine mounting frame. The wheels were enclosed in fairings, and there was a castoring tail wheel. Steering on the ground was control through hand operated <b>differential</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The P2008 {{is powered}} by a Rotax 912ULS flat four piston engine driving a two blade propeller. [...] The cabin seats two side-by side with a door each side and baggage space behind. [...] The cabin and cabin doors are wider than on earlier Tecnam high-wing aircraft. [...] Its fixed {{tricycle}} undercarriage has spring cantilever main legs and a castoring, non-steerable nosewheel on a compressed rubber suspension. [...] Ground steering is achieved by <b>differential</b> <b>braking.</b> [...] All wheels have speed fairings.|$|E
2500|$|Europas {{first became}} {{available}} with a monowheel landing gear and a tailwheel. [...] The wings had small castors on outriggers that were lowered with the flaps. Shaw chose the monowheel configuration for its perceived advantages of reduced weight and improved performance over a [...] tricycle configuration. [...] In practise, the monowheel Europa proved tricky [...] in inexperienced hands {{and could be}} prone to prop-strikes and groundlooping (partly {{due to the lack}} of <b>differential</b> <b>braking)</b> so the company developed a tricycle undercarriage which has become the more popular version, particularly as any performance disadvantage has been slight.|$|E
2500|$|The S-37 was a two bay {{sesquiplane}} using parallel interplane struts and bracing wires. Based on the S-35 {{its construction}} was very similar, an all metal fuselage and main wing made of Duralumin {{and covered with}} fabric. The empennage featured a triple tail with the rudders placed in the slipstream of each engine and a center vertical stabilizer that was adjustable from a lever in the cockpit. The first S-37 was initially powered by [...] Gnome-Rhône 9A Jupiter engines with the main fuel tanks located in the fairings behind each engine. A small two-cylinder hand-started auxiliary power unit mounted in the fuselage below the cockpit generated compressed air used to start the main engines. Main wheel brakes were hydraulically controlled with <b>differential</b> <b>braking.</b> The nose of the fuselage was hinged and concealed an opening [...] wide by [...] tall {{that could be used}} for baggage or an auxiliary fuel tank.|$|E
5000|$|An {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} L3314 was offered on the civilian market in 1977 as the C202. It was a hard-top with the more powerful B20 engine instead of the B18, but with less robust axles and no <b>differential</b> <b>brake.</b> The C202 was manufactured in Hungary as a cheaper alternative to the more expensive C303. Civilian versions of the L3314 series, {{as well as the}} C202, are often called the Volvo [...] "Laplander".|$|R
5000|$|The Car of the Future {{program was}} created to address this, aiming to reduce running costs to $250,000. This was {{achieved}} {{through the use of}} [...] "control" [...] parts; where teams had previously been charged with designing and developing their own parts, the Car of the Future regulations called for these parts to be built independently and to a set specification. The basic chassis and roll cage, <b>differential,</b> <b>brakes,</b> cooling and fuel systems and rear suspension were all changed to control parts.|$|R
5000|$|Split ailerons. The {{top surface}} moves up while the lower surface moves down. Splitting the aileron {{on one side}} induces yaw by {{creating}} a <b>differential</b> air <b>brake</b> effect.|$|R
50|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>braking</b> {{depends on}} {{asymmetric}} {{application of the}} brakes on the main gear wheels to turn the aircraft. For this, the aircraft must be equipped with separate controls for {{the right and left}} brakes (usually on the rudder pedals). The nose or tail wheel usually is not equipped with brakes. <b>Differential</b> <b>braking</b> requires considerable skill. In aircraft with several methods of steering that include <b>differential</b> <b>braking,</b> <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> may be avoided because of the wear it puts on the braking mechanisms. <b>Differential</b> <b>braking</b> has the advantage of being largely independent of any movement or skidding of the nose or tailwheel.|$|E
50|$|The 400 {{nosewheel}} is {{not directly}} steerable; directional control while taxiing is accomplished using <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> on the mainwheels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>braking</b> {{actually}} predates clutch braking on tracked vehicles, {{having been}} initially introduced by Richard Hornsby & Sons in 1905 on the world's first tracked vehicle.

British tanks began using them during World War I, and continued into World War II. One common example was the Bren Carrier.|$|E
50|$|Another {{approach}} is to use <b>differential</b> air <b>braking</b> to affect the drag directly. This technique is suited to Electronic flight controls, as on the Northrop Grumman B-2 flying wing.|$|R
50|$|All Cherokees have a {{brake lever}} under the pilot {{side of the}} {{instrument}} panel. <b>Differential</b> toe <b>brakes</b> on the rudder pedals were an optional add-on for earlier Cherokees, and became standard with later models.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The Universal Carrier was a {{widespread}} {{example of the}} <b>braked</b> <b>differential</b> system.|$|R
50|$|Steering on land is {{provided}} by <b>differential</b> <b>braking.</b> Hydraulic nose-wheel steering is available as an option. A retractable water rudder is slaved to the air rudder for water operation.|$|E
50|$|The SparrowHawk has a {{tricycle}} undercarriage with three equal-size wheels mounted off the keel, supplemented by a smaller tailwheel. Steering {{on the ground}} is by rudder pedal-controlled <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> and a steerable nosewheel.|$|E
50|$|Pilot and {{passengers}} enter the DA40 via {{the leading edge}} of the wing, an unusual feature among low-wing aircraft. The aircraft's nosewheel is free-castoring and directional control while taxiing is by mainwheel <b>differential</b> <b>braking.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It is {{a version}} of C30 {{inspired}} by the Polestar STCC race car based on T5, designed by Polestar Performance. It included 2.5L Turbo engine with larger intercooler and KK & K 26 turbo, modified pistons, conrods and inlet camshaft, rated [...] and 510 Nm; Haldex AWD with Quaife mechanical <b>differential</b> <b>brake</b> front and rear, Öhlins shock absorbers and springs with 2.25 ratio steering rack, Brembo 380mm front brake discs with six piston calipers, Brembo 330mm rear brake discs with four piston calipers, BBS FI 19x8,19-inch wheels with Pirelli P Zero 235/35 ZR 19 tires, racing seats with Ternsjö leather and four point harness, aerodynamic body derived from the STCC race car.|$|R
50|$|The car uses a donor pack from a BMW 3 Series. The donor pack {{includes}} <b>differential,</b> half-shafts, <b>brakes,</b> {{steering column}} and lower steering shaft and if required, engine and gearbox. The chassis comes with BMW engine mounts already welded to the chassis to ease fitment.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{hierarchical}} control architecture for lateral stabilization in automotive vehicles is proposed in this paper. The proposed direct yaw stabilization strategy {{is based on}} the optimal coordination of two conventional stabilization systems (<b>differential</b> <b>brake</b> and traction torque transfer). Thanks to this approach, high stabilization capabilities are obtained while the impact on the longitudinal motion is reduced. The control architecture is a three layer structure composed of a high-level control, an optimal control allocation and a low-level control. The main idea consists in the use of a dual-mode control allocation formulation to handle the different operating modes of the wheel according to available actuators, i. e. conventional braking and/or torque transfer. The performance of the integrated control strategy proposed is highlighted through simulation results...|$|R
