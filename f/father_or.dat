5|$|Born on 14 March 1822 in Naples, TeresaCristina {{became an}} orphan {{when her father}} died in 1830. Her mother {{is said to have}} {{neglected}} her after marrying a young officer in 1839. Historiography has long asserted that she was raised in lonely isolation, in an environment of religious superstition, intolerance and conservatism. It has also described Teresa Cristina as a soft and timid character, unlike her ruthless <b>father</b> <b>or</b> her impulsive mother. She has even been depicted as unassertive, and accustomed to be satisfied in whatever circumstances she found herself.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{tensions}} faded, but {{a bigger}} decision awaited Robert Breckinridge in 1828. He {{was chosen to}} sit on a committee that would draft Kentucky's response to the Nullification Crisis. Because much of South Carolina's reasoning for their actions was based on the logic of the Kentucky Resolutions, which had been supported by Senator John Breckinridge, Robert Breckinridge now had to determine whether he should support the words of his late <b>father</b> <b>or</b> refute them. In the end, his Unionist sympathies overrode his sense of loyalty to his father; he sided with the committee's majority in condemning South Carolina's actions.|$|E
5|$|He held six consulships during Vespasian's reign {{but only}} one of these, in 73, was an {{ordinary}} consulship. The other five were less prestigious suffect consulships, which he held in 71, 75, 76, 77 and 79 respectively, usually replacing his <b>father</b> <b>or</b> brother in mid-January. While ceremonial, these offices no doubt gained Domitian valuable experience in the Roman Senate, and {{may have contributed to}} his later reservations about its relevance.|$|E

The event, {{including}} a play entitled The <b>Father,</b> <b>or</b> Family Feuds and a pantomime afterwards named Raymond and Agnes, was held in December. It being Christmas time, the auditorium was packed—with 518 adults and 80 children.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, {{strong belief}} in astrology {{has led to}} {{dramatic}} changes in the fertility rate and the number of abortions in the years of Fire Horse. Adherents believe that women born in hinoeuma years are unmarriageable and bring bad luck to their <b>father</b> <b>or</b> husband. In 1966, the number of babies born in Japan dropped by over 25% as parents tried to avoid the stigma of having a daughter born in the hinoeuma year.|$|E
5|$|Parents can {{be either}} the {{biological}} mother or biological <b>father,</b> <b>or</b> the legal guardian for adopted children. Traditionally, mothers were responsible for raising the kids while the father was out providing financially for the family. The age group for parents ranges from teenage parents to grandparents who have decided to raise their grandchildren, with teenage pregnancies fluctuating based on race and culture. Older parents are financially established and generally have fewer problems raising children compared to their teenage counterparts.|$|E

5|$|Richard {{was said}} to have been tall, good-looking and intelligent. Less warlike than either his <b>father</b> <b>or</b> grandfather, he sought {{to bring an end to}} the Hundred Years' War that Edward III had started. He was a firm believer in the royal prerogative, which led him to {{restrain}} the power of the aristocracy, and to rely on a private retinue for military protection instead; in contrast to the fraternal, martial court of his grandfather, he cultivated a refined atmosphere at his court, in which the king was an elevated figure, with art and culture at its centre.|$|E
5|$|Sai Baba's {{real name}} remains unknown. The name 'Sai' {{was given to}} him by Mhalsapati when he arrived at Shirdi, a town now in the west Indian state of Maharashtra. The word 'Sai' refers to a {{religious}} mendicant but can also mean 'God'. In several Indian and Middle Eastern languages the term 'Baba' is an honorific signifying grandfather, father, old man or sir. Thus Sai Baba denotes holy father, saintly <b>father</b> <b>or</b> (venerable) poor old man.|$|E

5|$|According to a 1996 {{study by}} Barbara Metcalf, in TJ women were {{encouraged}} to participate {{since the beginning of}} the movement. Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first jamaat of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi. Accompanied by a close male relative, (محرم), that is husband, brother, <b>father</b> <b>or</b> son, women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands. Jamaats of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is the {{youngest}} of King Triton and Queen Athena's seven daughters. She is often seen {{in the company of}} Flounder, her best friend, and Sebastian, her father's advisor who is often assigned {{to keep an eye on}} her. In the television series and first film, Ariel has a fascination with the human world and often goes off to find human artifacts that she displays in a secret grotto. Ariel is often rebellious, wandering off on her own to explore her surroundings, and frequently disobeys the orders of her <b>father</b> <b>or</b> Sebastian, causing conflict between the characters. In The Little Mermaid, she is depicted as being willing to do anything to be with Prince Eric, even giving up her voice to become human. Clements described her as a typical teenager, prone to errors of judgment. She also is incredibly curious, and her curiosity often leads her into dangerous situations.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the vague}} {{language}} of the document, {{there has been much}} scholarly debate over how it should be interpreted. John Maddicott saw the wording as a hostile warning to the new king to avoid the mistakes of his <b>father,</b> <b>or</b> face the consequences. J. R. S. Phillips, on the other hand, took the signatories to be positively inclined towards Edward II. There were others who were more intrinsic in their opposition to the king and Gaveston, primarily the Earl of Warwick. The purpose of the document, in Phillips view, was to present the king with a warning, and hopefully protect him against the more antagonistic members of the nobility.|$|E

5|$|Beyond {{the obvious}} honour, the award also carries a cash {{allowance}} for those under {{the rank of}} lieutenant (or the appropriate service equivalent), {{and in some cases}} a cash award. Upon the death of the recipient, the pension is transferred to the widow until her death or remarriage. In the case of a posthumous recipient who is a bachelor, the allowance is paid to his <b>father</b> <b>or</b> mother. In the case of the award being conferred posthumously on a widower, the allowance is to be paid to his son or unmarried daughter. A monthly stipend of 10,000 rupees is given the awardee. The award amount and pension benefits are exempted from income tax. In addition, different ministries under the Central Government have various awards for PVC winners.|$|E
5|$|Burger's Daughter details a {{group of}} white anti-apartheid activists in South Africa seeking to {{overthrow}} the South African government. It {{is set in the}} mid-1970s, and follows the life of Rosa, the title character, as she comes to terms with her father Lionel Burger's legacy as an activist in the South African Communist Party (SACP). The perspective shifts between Rosa's internal monologue (often directed towards her <b>father</b> <b>or</b> her lover Conrad), and the omniscient narrator. The novel is rooted {{in the history of the}} anti-apartheid struggle and references to actual events and people from that period, including Nelson Mandela and the 1976 Soweto uprising.|$|E
5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} {{told the}} court {{that the kind of}} violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her. In particular, {{he said he did not}} believe she would have killed her <b>father</b> <b>or</b> children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she had never harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she had never known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, {{told the court}} that Sheila did not know how to use one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood outside the house, that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.|$|E

Eddie calls the house, but Rhys is short with him. While Rhys is choosing whether to see his <b>father</b> <b>or</b> not, Elaine gives him all the letters he ever wrote to him and tells him to read them first. Rhys later decides to see his father. During Sonya and Toadie's wedding reception, a gas bottle explodes destroying the marquee. Rhys is initially trapped inside, but he manages to pull himself out. He suffers some minor injuries and broken ribs. Elaine comes to see him {{at the hospital and}} she tells him that she supports his decision to see his father. Rhys discharges himself, against Karl's wishes. He then collapses in the car park and dies from an undetected blood clot.|$|E
5|$|The Roce (anointing) ceremony, {{conducted}} one or {{two days}} before a wedding, celebrates the last day of virginity of the bride and bridegroom and involves the parents' blessing of the bride and groom, who are anointed with roce, a mixture of coconut milk and coconut oil, while a cross is inscribed on the bride's forehead. The marriage traditions include Soirik (betrothal), exchange of Paan Pod (betel leaves) during the marriage ceremony, which known as Badalchen (changing hands; formal acceptance of the promise made by the bride's father to the bridegroom's father that he will give his daughter in marriage). The bride is adorned with the Sado (wedding sari) and Pirduk (wedding necklace). Other rites include the Onpnni (giving away the bride formally by the <b>father</b> <b>or</b> the guardian of the bride), Porthoponn (re-invitation to the bride's house), and singing of Honvious (hymns). Some non-marriage traditions include Novemjeevon (partaking of the food prepared from new corn) and Novem (blessing of new harvests).|$|E
5|$|When {{the emperor}} died without officially {{appointing}} a successor, his widow, the empress dowager, had the sole right to appoint {{one of the}} late emperor's surviving sons or relatives to the position. Most often the successor chosen in this fashion was a minor, thus the empress dowager served as regent over the government. A high-status male relative, usually a <b>father</b> <b>or</b> brother, would assume control of the Imperial Secretariat. Even when an emperor reached his majority and became an active ruler, he often sought the advice and acceptance of the empress dowager on policy decisions; she also {{had the right to}} override his decisions. The empress dowager was protected by the Minister of the Guards, yet if her faction—the consort clan— was removed from power, he was then responsible for keeping her under house arrest.|$|E
