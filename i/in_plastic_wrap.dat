2500|$|The {{music video}} begins with Scherzinger {{sitting in the}} back of a London hackney carriage. As the rain pours outside and raindrops cover the windows, she sings the first verse while {{changing}} her smart clothes for more casual ones. She stares longingly out of the carriage's window, watching the rain outside. During the chorus, there are two main scenes. In the first she is seen wrapped in blanket while in the second she walks across the room of an old house, in need of renovation. The lighting is cold and dim, and most of the furniture is covered <b>in</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap.</b> Scherzinger stares resentfully at her surroundings while crossing the room. In the second verse, Scherzinger stands in front of a mirror in the bathroom of the house where she has a moment of realisation. After turning the taps on for a while, the sink overflows as she scornfully looks in the mirror, relating to the lyrics of the song. She is then scene walking towards the camera, through a hallway of the house. It is a confident independent walk towards the audience with lights flashing rhythmically behind her. The bridge sees Scherzinger sitting in one the house's empty rooms, in an old armchair and intersects some of the earlier carriage and bathroom scenes. As she sings the lyric [...] "The screen fades to black", the blanket seen earlier on falls in front of the camera, revealing a close up shot of Scherzinger's face. Her hair flows in the wind and she finally gets up from the armchair to stand in front of the room's open windows. In the final scene, she stands confidently in front of the window as wind and light flood the room. She sings the final verse of the song, looking directly at the camera and smiling for the first time in the video.|$|E

Commonly used methods to counter this effect include storing the guacamole in an air-tight container or <b>wrapping</b> tightly <b>in</b> clear <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> to limit the surface area exposed to the air.|$|R

40|$|This {{meta-analysis}} {{aimed to}} investigate the efficacy and safety of <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> applied after birth and during NICU in preterm infants for prevention of heat loss in preterm infants. The Medline (1950 to August 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 7, 2015), CINAHL (1982 to August 2015) and the Embase (1974 to August 2015) databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs with main outcomes related to the core temperature (baseline temperature and/or post-stabilization temperature), hypothermia, mortality rate and hyperthermia. The included studies were of low to moderate quality. Compared with unwrapped infants, <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> {{was associated with a}} significantly higher baseline temperature and post-stabilization temperature both in infants < 28 weeks of gestation (mean difference [MD] = 0. 62, 95 % CI 0. 38 to 0. 85; MD = 0. 41, 95 % CI 0. 33 to 0. 50, respectively), and in infants between 28 to 34 weeks of gestation (MD = 0. 54, 95 % CI 0. 21 to 0. 87; MD = 0. 64, 95 % CI 0. 45 to 0. 82, respectively). Use of <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> was associated with lower incidence of hypothermia (relative risk [RR] = 0. 70, 95 % CI 0. 63 to 0. 78). However, use of <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>in</b> preterm infants was not associated with decrease in mortality (RR: 0. 88, 95 % CI 0. 70 to 1. 12, P = 0. 31). Incidence of hyperthermia was significantly higher <b>in</b> the <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> group as compared to that in the control group (RR = 2. 55, 95 % CI: 1. 56 to 4. 15, P = 0. 0002). Hyperthermia <b>in</b> the <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> group was resolved within one or two hours after unwrapping the babies. <b>Plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> can be considered an effective and safe additional intervention to prevent hypothermia in preterm infants.

50|$|Modern {{commercial}} {{fast food}} is often highly processed and prepared {{in an industrial}} fashion, i.e., {{on a large scale}} with standard ingredients and standardized cooking and production methods.

In most fast food operations, menu items are generally made from processed ingredients prepared at a central supply facility and then shipped to individual outlets where they are reheated, cooked (usually by microwave or deep frying) or assembled in a short amount of time.
