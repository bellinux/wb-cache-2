5|$|From {{an early}} age, Reines {{exhibited}} {{an interest in}} science, and liked creating and building things. He later recalled that: The first stirrings of interest in science that I remember occurred during a moment of boredom at religious school, when, looking {{out of the window}} at twilight through a hand curled to simulate a telescope, <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> something peculiar about the light; it was the phenomenon of diffraction. That began for me a fascination with light.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} {{recommended}} {{to me as}} a man of energy and enthusiasm, but he seemed shy when we met. It was only on further acquaintance that <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> other traits. He was extremely good company, with a sharp tongue and an inclination to dismiss most of humanity as spies and traitors. I rather liked that! I discovered he was very ambitious, perhaps more than his abilities warranted, and also very excitable. He sometimes worked himself up into such a state that he lost all powers of reasoning.|$|E
5|$|So I {{went out}} and saw the band – Billy, James, and D'arcy – playing at Avalon with a drum machine. Man, did they sound horrible! They were atrocious. But the thing <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> was that {{not only were the}} song {{structures}} good, but Billy's voice had a lot of drive to it, like he was dying to succeed. So I ended up driving from work every Wednesday to rehearse with them.|$|E

5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E
25|$|Following {{another round}} of booing and the {{throwing}} of more cans, Illingworth ordered and led his men {{from the field and}} <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that to some of them he had to repeat his order at least twice...Had the Englishmen remained on the field I doubt whether play could have resumed.|$|E
25|$|Wolfgang was {{complaining}} of his eyes. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> {{his head was}} warm, that his cheeks were hot and very red, but that his hands were cold as ice. Moreover, his pulse was not right. So we gave him some black powder and put him to bed. During the night he was rather restless {{and in the morning}} he still had the dry fever.|$|E

25|$|Then {{it started}} to strike houses. All the parcels of goods which were on board shifted {{toward the front of}} the plane. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> beside me a hole by which I left without knowing how, and I fell into a mud puddle. I then could {{contemplate}} the flames which consumed the plane. It was not about excess weight. It's a simple mechanical failure.|$|E
25|$|The 29th had dawned calm, {{but while}} we were still trying to persuade {{ourselves}} that the tragedy was over and the volcano had exhausted its bowels, at about 8 o'clock, we heard a crash and then <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that smoke was rising {{from the point of}} the island that looks towards east. The smoke spread very gradually as far as the crater of the volcano, while there were many whiffs issuing from points in the direction of another headland. I realized that the island had opened in these places and fearing that, if a crater should open below the water, an explosion might follow, much more formidable than the preceding ones, I mounted a horse and retired permanently to the Sanctuary of Caysasay.|$|E
500|$|Mitchell {{coaches in}} a quiet and {{cerebral}} style which he picked up from the first head coach under who he worked, saying with typical understatement, [...] "Coach Bryant wasn't a screamer, and <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> he had some success."

500|$|Later {{on in his}} speech, President Reagan said, [...] "As I {{looked out}} a moment ago from the Reichstag, that {{embodiment}} of German unity, <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> words crudely spray-painted upon the wall, perhaps by a young Berliner, 'This wall will fall. Beliefs become reality.' Yes, across Europe, this wall will fall. For it cannot withstand faith; it cannot withstand truth. The wall cannot withstand freedom." ...|$|E

500|$|Just as the {{aircraft}} hit takeoff speed, the No.1 Engine and its pylon assembly {{separated from the}} left wing, ripping away a [...] section of the leading edge with it. The combined unit flipped {{over the top of}} the wing and landed on the runway. Robert Graham, supervisor of maintenance for American Airlines, stated: [...] "As {{the aircraft}} got closer, <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> what appeared to be vapor or smoke of some type coming from the leading edge of the wing and the No. 1 engine pylon. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that the No. 1 engine was bouncing up and down quite a bit and just about the time the aircraft got opposite my position and started rotation, the engine came off, went up {{over the top of the}} wing, and rolled back down onto the runway... Before going over the wing, the engine went forward and up just as if it had lift and was actually climbing. It didn't strike the top of the wing on its way, rather it followed the clear path of the airflow of the wing, up and over the top of it, then down below the tail. The aircraft continued a fairly normal climb until it started a turn to the left. And at that point, I thought he was going to come back to the airport." ...|$|E

500|$|In a 1971 {{letter to}} Paul McCartney, Lennon wrote, [...] "When {{people ask me}} {{questions}} about 'What did George Martin really do for you?,' I have only one answer, 'What does he do now?' <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> you had no answer for that! It's not a putdown, it's the truth." [...] Lennon wrote that Martin took too much credit for the Beatles' music. Commenting specifically on [...] "Revolution 9", Lennon said with ironic authority, [...] "For Martin to state that he was 'painting a sound picture' is pure hallucination. Ask {{any of the other}} people involved. The final editing Yoko and I did alone." ...|$|E
500|$|Herc {{carefully}} {{studied the}} dancers. [...] "I was smoking cigarettes and I {{was waiting for}} the records to finish. And <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> people was waiting for certain parts of the record," [...] he says. It was an insight as profound as Ruddy Redwood's dub discovery. The moment when the dancers really got wild was in a song's short instrumental break, when the band would drop out and the rhythm section would get elemental. Forget melody, chorus, songs—it was all about the groove, building it, keeping it going. Like a string theorist, Herc zeroed in on the fundamental vibrating loop {{at the heart of the}} record, the break.|$|E
500|$|After {{scoring a}} string of hits in 1976 and 1977 (most notably [...] "Natsu Ni Giyojin" [...] (Beware of the Summer) which sold 360,000 copies, [...] "Ki Ga Tsuite Yo" [...] (<b>I</b> <b>Noticed)</b> which sold 286,000 copies [...] and [...] "Kimagure Venus" [...] (Whimsical Venus) which sold 210,000 copies) [...] she was again awarded at the 20th edition of the Japan Record Awards for her single [...] "Shiawase Shibai" [...] (Pretending to be Happy) which sold over 366,000 copies and peaked at number 3 on the charts [...] (penned by Miyuki Nakajima) with a gold medal. She would score her last top 10 hit single {{in the summer of}} 1978 with the disco {{inspired}} single [...] "Lipstick", and would release her last single and album in 1983.|$|E

500|$|Advised of her failing health, Bishop Ignace Bourget visited Cadron-Jetté on April 4, 1864, and {{administered}} {{to her the}} last rites. Rosalie Cadron-Jetté died shortly thereafter, during {{the early hours of}} April 5, 1864. Her death was witnessed by Sister Marie-des-Saints-Anges, who said this of the occasion: [...] "I witnessed her blessed death. I was sitting vigil with our good sister Sainte-Béatrix. Around 2 a.m. she made {{the sign of the cross}} and asked us to recite the Litanies of the Virgin Mary; then she arranged herself as if to prepare for sleep, then in a high pitched voice she said: O my Jesus! Then <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> she was getting weaker; we brought the light closer to her and realized she had already passed over to a better life." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} after the episode aired, Sapochnik detailed {{the process of}} filming the battle and called Akira Kurosawa's Ran an inspiration in shooting the scenes: [...] "I watched every pitch field battle I could find (footage of real ones too), looking for patterns — for what works, what doesn't, what takes {{you out of the}} moment, what keeps you locked in. Interestingly one of the things <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> is that staging of these battles through the years has changed dramatically. Back in the day you'd see these huge aerial shots of horse charges and there were two big differences. First, it was all real — no CGI or digital replication. And second, often when the horses would go down, you can kind of tell they got really hurt. Nowadays you'd never get away with that, and nor would you want to." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 4, 2012, Joe Francis, {{the creator}} of the Girls Gone Wild video franchisee, {{threatened}} to sue Madonna if she sang the song during her halftime show performance. His representatives said that [...] " [...] violated Federal and State trademark laws by making unauthorized use of Mr. Francis' trademark Girls Gone Wild in not only the title, but subject line of her various advertisements in order to lure potential consumers to purchase her latest musical effort." [...] The National Football League (NFL) revealed in their magazine that the song would not be performed at the Super Bowl. On hearing about the allegations, Moxey commented that Francis only wanted attention from the press, adding: [...] "When I looked at ASCAP, <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> there were approximately 50 records called 'Girls Gone Wild'. This guy just thinks too much of himself." ...|$|E
