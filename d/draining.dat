The major river systems originating in the Western Ghats include Godavari, Kaveri, Krishna, Thamiraparani and Tungabhadra. Majority of streams <b>draining</b> the Western Ghats join these rivers and carry large volume of water during the monsoon months. These rivers flow to the east due to the gradient of the land and drain out into the Bay of Bengal. Major tributaries include Kali, Bhadra, Bhavani, Bhima, Malaprabha, Ghataprabha, Hemavathi and Kabini. Periyar, Bharathappuzha, Netravati, Sharavathi, Mandovi and Zuari rivers flow westwards towards the Western Ghats, <b>draining</b> into the Arabian Sea and are fast-moving, owing to the steeper gradient.|$|E

5000|$|Before the 1840s simple surface <b>drains</b> or covered <b>drains</b> {{were used}} in towns.

These <b>drains</b> caused problems because it was common for the entire volume of the <b>drain</b> to be completely filled and blocked.

The required parameters can be obtained after a few iterations. However, the number of iterations may increase significantly when prefabricated vertical <b>drains</b> or strip <b>drains</b> are used as the <b>drain</b> size is predetermined by manufacturers and available only in a very limited range.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION A <b>drain</b> describes any material or equipment used to prevent {{the formation of a}} haematoma or to carry fluid from inside the body to the surface. Allowing unwanted fluid or blood to remain in a wound may be a potential source of infection and may also impede healing, or result in wound breakdown and dehiscence. Wound <b>drains</b> are classified as closed or open drainage systems. 1. Closed <b>drains</b> do not expose the contents to the atmosphere. They include vacuum <b>drains</b> which apply negative pressure such as the Redivac®, or non-vacuum systems such as the T-tube <b>drain.</b> 1 The <b>drain</b> is often secured with a suture. The use of a closed <b>drain</b> system lowers the risk of potential infection for patients and reduces staff contact with body fluids. 2. Open <b>drains</b> allow communication with the atmosphere. These <b>drains</b> include corrugated <b>drains,</b> the Penrose <b>drain</b> and sump <b>drains.</b> 1 Open <b>drains</b> are inserted directly into the wound bed and they <b>drain</b> into a dressing.
