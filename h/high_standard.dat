5|$|The artistic {{workshops}} {{established by}} Æthelwold reached a <b>high</b> <b>standard</b> of craftsmanship in manuscript illustration, sculpture and gold and silver, and were influential both in England {{and on the}} Continent. In his monasteries, learning reached a <b>high</b> <b>standard,</b> producing competent prose and poetry in the elaborate hermeneutic style of Latin favoured in tenth-century England. His Winchester school {{played an important role}} in creating the standard vernacular West Saxon literary language, and his pupil Ælfric was its most eminent writer.|$|E

40|$|Using {{a general}} {{equilibrium}} model this paper analyses the overall process through which <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> production and consumption affect development. Market imperfections are so critical in modeling the real effects of <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> {{that we have to}} take into account four kinds of them: labor market segmentation, labor migration costs, credit constraints and fixed costs. Our model allows to measure structural production changes and welfare effects on rural and urban households through various channels. We calibrate and simulate the model using the dataset of China, which is just in its middle development phase. The simulation results show that the issue of exclusion depends on the neutrality of shocks or policies leading to the expansion of <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> sector, that inequality and poverty would decrease when the world price for <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> food increase and when richer consumers increase preferences for <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> food, and that the gain from labor market can cover the loss of exclusion from <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> farming if more efficient farms expand their output in <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> sector. The interaction of several related markets also provides some insights for the logic of China-style gradual markets reform. 1...|$|R

5|$|According to {{the disputed}} {{statements}} of the ancient writers and some modern scholars, in Athens Aspasia became a hetaera and probably ran a brothel. Hetaerae were professional high-class entertainers, as well as courtesans. Besides displaying physical beauty, they differed from most Athenian women in being educated (often to a <b>high</b> <b>standard,</b> as in Aspasia's case), having independence, and paying taxes. They were the nearest thing perhaps to liberated women; and Aspasia, who became a vivid figure in Athenian society, was probably an obvious example. According to Plutarch, Aspasia was compared to the famous Thargelia, another renowned Ionian hetaera of ancient times.|$|E
5|$|An {{inventory}} {{taken in}} 1634 after Zouche's death listed the library as having 250 {{books and a}} collection of mathematical instruments, and revealed that the maids' chamber was of a very <b>high</b> <b>standard.</b> James Zouch, grandson of Edward la Zouche, sold the property to the Earl of Antrim in 1637, at which time the house's furniture was valued at £2,762. During the reign of Charles I, the house was partly destroyed by a fire. On 25 June 1640, Lord Antrim sold Bramshill for £9,500 to Sir Robert Henley. In 1673 it was the property of his son, Sir Andrew Henley, 1st Baronet.|$|E
50|$|Limited {{research}} {{exists on}} other psychological constructs to which maximizing is related. However, {{several studies have}} shown maximizing {{to be associated with}} perfectionism, and Nenkov et al. (2008) qualified this relationship as being true primarily for the <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> component. Some research has also linked maximizing to high need for cognition, again primarily with the <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> component. Finally, research examining the association between maximizing and personality dimensions of the Big Five personality model have found <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> to be associated with high conscientiousness and decision difficulty with low conscientiousness. Alternative search has also been associated with high neuroticism, and <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> has been associated with high openness to experience.|$|R

5|$|Broke drilled {{his crew}} to an {{extremely}} <b>high</b> <b>standard</b> of naval gunnery; he regularly had them fire at targets, such as floating barrels. Often these drills {{would be made}} into competitions to see which gun crew could hit the target and how fast they could do so. He even had his gun crews fire at targets 'blindfold' to good effect; they were only given the bearing to lay their gun on without being allowed to sight the gun on the target themselves. This constituted a very early example of 'director firing'.|$|E
5|$|Chapman {{was popular}} at Cambridge and enjoyed his time there. He {{took part in}} a variety of social engagements and became {{involved}} in other sports. These included fives, tennis, rugby union, golf and football. He captained Pembroke College at rugby and was close to playing for the full university side. Chapman continued to play rugby for Berkshire Wanderers until he was nearly 30 years old. Also for Pembroke, he played as goalkeeper in the football team and might have played for the university at hockey had he taken the sport seriously. In later years, he also displayed proficiency at tennis, in which critics thought he could have reached a <b>high</b> <b>standard</b> if motivated to do so, and golf.|$|E

Anton Webern conducted eight BBC SO concerts between 1931 and 1936.|$|E

5|$|During the 20th century both choral and organ musical {{components}} {{developed to}} a <b>high</b> <b>standard</b> and were {{integral to the}} liturgy at St James'. In addition, music was offered to the wider community {{in the form of}} recitals, often in ways that elucidate the liturgy and take advantage of church acoustics and sacred settings. Weekday recitals, such as the organ recitals given in 1936 of music by Bach, continued in addition to the music played on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|Following the sinking, a Board of Inquiry was {{established}} to investigate the loss. Based on its findings, Captain Loben Maund was court-martialled in February 1942 for negligence. He was found guilty on two counts of negligence: one of failing to ensure that properly constituted damage control parties had remained on board after the general evacuation, and one of failing to ensure the ship was in a sufficient state of readiness to deal with possible damage. The board tempered their judgement with an acknowledgement that a <b>high</b> <b>standard</b> was being expected of Maund, {{and that he was}} primarily concerned with the welfare of his crew.|$|E
5|$|Gabon gained its {{independence}} from France on 17 August 1960. The country had a relatively <b>high</b> <b>standard</b> of living and {{was considered one of}} the more stable countries in West Africa, both politically and economically. At the time of the coup, the country had an estimated US$200 average annual income {{and was one of the}} few countries in Africa with a positive trade balance, with exports exceeding imports by 30 percent. As of 1964, the country was among the largest producers of uranium and manganese in French Africa, which Time suggested was one of the reasons for France's response to the coup. It also had petroleum, iron, and logging interests stationed in Gabon.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to their British counterparts, the French Navy {{was in a}} state of confusion. Although the quality of the fleet's ships was high, the fleet hierarchy was riven by the same crises that had torn through France since the Revolution five years earlier. Consequently, the <b>high</b> <b>standard</b> of ships and ordnance was not matched by that of the available crews, which were largely untrained and inexperienced. With the Terror resulting in the death or dismissal of many senior French sailors and officers, political appointees and conscripts – many of whom had never been to sea at all, let alone in a fighting vessel – filled the Atlantic fleet.|$|E

5|$|Indeed, the {{evacuation}} of casualties and the resupply of ammunition at times proved problematic, and heavy shelling and sniper fire disrupted stretcher parties and porters {{on a number of}} occasions, resulting in the forward companies running short of ammunition. Meanwhile, the quality of support given to the British and Australian infantry by the artillery and tanks was of a <b>high</b> <b>standard</b> and proved a critical factor. Indeed, the tanks had often operated in terrain to which they were unsuited, while the New Zealand gunners had fired over 50,000 rounds in direct support of 3 RAR, blistering the paint off the barrels of their guns. Air support, including that provided by the South African Mustangs, had been important throughout.|$|E

Following the match, Oliver Kahn announced his retirement from the German National Team. Throughout his international career he earned 86 caps for Germany, including 49 as team captain.
