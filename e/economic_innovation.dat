[...] This idea of management was later expounded upon by Joseph Alois Schumpeter in {{his treatment of}} <b>economic</b> <b>innovation.</b> Value theory was revolutionary because it opened {{the debate on the}} question of economic value, introducing an objective calculation to a subjective theory.

50|$|The {{concept of}} a Space Weather <b>Economic</b> <b>Innovation</b> Zone stems {{from the work of}} the American Commercial Space Weather Association (ACSWA) in 2015. The {{establishment}} of this <b>economic</b> <b>innovation</b> zone would encourage expanded economic activity developing applications to manage the risks space weather and would encourage broader research activities related to space weather by universities. The formation of a Space Weather <b>Economic</b> <b>Innovation</b> Zone would: encourage U.S. business investment in space weather services and products; support U.S. business innovation in space weather services and products; require U.S. government purchases of U.S. built commercial hardware, software, and associated products and services where no suitable government capability pre-exists; promote U.S. built commercial hardware, software, and associated products and services to international partners; designate U.S. built commercial hardware, services, and products as “Space Weather <b>Economic</b> <b>Innovation</b> Zone” activities; and track U.S. built commercial hardware, services, and products as Space Weather <b>Economic</b> <b>Innovation</b> Zone contributions within agency reports. In 2015 HR1561 provided groundwork where social and environmental impacts from a Space Weather <b>Economic</b> <b>Innovation</b> Zone could be far-reaching. U.S. built commercial hardware, services, and products can prevent economic disruptions and loss-of-life from societal risks resulting from space weather and an innovation zone would encourage the research and investment needed for this success. In 2016, the Space Weather Research and Forecasting Act (S. 2817) would potentially build on that legacy.|$|E

30|$|Disaster {{recovery}} {{is important in}} <b>economic</b> <b>innovations.</b> The recovery path is as much needed to build the future stronger as to repair past damages, because <b>economic</b> <b>innovations</b> usually appear in the normal market fully recovered from a disaster. While FEMA keeps continuing to collaborate with local, state and other federal partners, supporting the recovery of individuals, families, businesses and communities from the superstorm begins from the economic damage assessment measured as accurately as we can. Even though various simulation results to be conducted and measured by HAZUS-NIEMO can advance our understanding of future hurricane impacts, the temporary income-loss approach applied in this study has its novelty especially in addressing short-term labor losses and understanding of economic disruptions that hinder innovations. Therefore, by adding the HAZUS-NIEMO that provides long-term strategies for the effectiveness of hurricane policies {{to this type of}} a short impact study, various adaptation and resilience efforts in reducing the economic losses after a hurricane can be more precise.|$|R
