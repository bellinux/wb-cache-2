40|$|Thrombin {{converts}} fibrinogen to fibrin in two steps. First <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A and fibrin I {{are formed}} and then <b>fibrinopeptide</b> B (B beta 1 - 14) and fibrin II. Since it is postulated that fibrin II {{is important in}} the genesis of thrombosis, it is of interest to measure <b>fibrinopeptide</b> B in peripheral blood samples. Previous difficulties in interpreting <b>fibrinopeptide</b> B immunoreactivity in plasma resulted from crossreaction of fibrinogen and of plasmin digest peptides B beta 1 - 42 and B beta 1 - 21 and from rapid loss of <b>fibrinopeptide</b> B immunoreactivity resulting from cleavage of arginine 14 by blood carboxypeptidase B. We have obviated these difficulties by removing fibrinogen from plasma by precipitation with ethanol and peptides B beta 1 - 21 and B beta 1 - 42 by adsorption on bentonite. <b>Fibrinopeptide</b> B is then converted to a desarginine <b>fibrinopeptide</b> B, which is measured in a new specific assay. Studies of the kinetics of <b>fibrinopeptide</b> cleavage showed that when whole blood was allowed to clot in vitro, <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A was cleaved more rapidly than <b>fibrinopeptide</b> B. In 18 patients on an acute care medical ward, desarginine <b>fibrinopeptide</b> B levels were lower than <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A levels and did not correlate with the levels of <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A or B beta 1 - 42.

In six patients receiving intraamniotic infusions of hypertonic saline to induce abortion, desarginine <b>fibrinopeptide</b> B levels increased 10 -fold from the preinfusion mean level of 0. 4 pmol/ml and then decreased. The pattern of changes resembled that of the <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A levels rather than of the B beta 1 - 42 levels.

50|$|Some DNA {{sequences}} {{are shared}} by very different organisms.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{basis of}} the wide variability of the physical properties of fibrin clots {{and the process of}} assembly of the clot were investigated by electron microscopy of fibers formed under various ionic conditions. In addition, highly specific proteolytic enzymes from different snake venoms were used to remove selectively only the A (batroxobin) or the B (venzyme) <b>fibrinopeptides</b> from fibrinogen, in contrast to thrombin, which removes both pairs. Fibers produced by cleavage of only the B <b>fibrinopeptides</b> displayed a characteristic band pattern indistinguishable from that of fibers formed upon removal of either the A <b>fibrinopeptides</b> alone or of both pairs. Computer modeling studies suggest that there is a unique molecular packing that gives rise to this fibrin band pattern. These findings imply that the release of either fibrinopeptide triggers similar modes of aggregation; the intermolecular binding sites can be localized to particular molecular domains. The diameters of fibers formed with each condition of enzyme, pH, salt concentration, and temperature were measured from electron micrographs. All fibers, except for those produced at both high ionic strength and pH, had about the same average diameter of 85 +/- 13 nm. The degree of lateral aggregation of the fibers themselves varied greatly, however; fibers aggregated more readily with cleavage of both pairs of <b>fibrinopeptides</b> and at lower pH and salt concentrations.

In the treated animals as compared to controls the clinical neurological signs of the disease wuch as the number, the severity and the duration of pareses were diminished. Furthermore, the inflammatory alterations of vasopermeability associated with extravasation of plasma proteins and oedema of the neuroparenchyma were significantly less pronounced in the fibrinopeptide-treated animals. Finally, a significantly higher titre of circulating immune complexes was observed in the serum of these animals. However, the treatment with <b>fibrinopeptides</b> A and B did not alter the specific immune response to the antigenic challenge. No differences in anti-basic protein and anti-brain antibody production were observed. The characteristic cellular infiltrates of EAE also showed no significant qualitative or quantitative differences between fibrinopeptide-treated animals and the saline-treated controls.

Fibrin prepared with reptilase, which cleaves only <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A from fibrinogen, and fibrin prepared with thrombin, which cleaves both <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A and <b>fibrinopeptide</b> B, equally supported endothelial cell adhesion. In contrast, only fibrin made with thrombin mediated endothelial cell spreading, as assessed by fluorescence microscopy of cells stained with rhodamine phalloidin to identify actin stress fibers or by scanning electron microscopy. Fibrin prepared with reptilase failed to support cell spreading. To further investigate {{the role of the}} amino terminus of the fibrin beta chain after <b>fibrinopeptide</b> B cleavage in promoting cell spreading, protease III from Crotalus atrox venom was used to specifically cleave the amino-terminal 42 residues of the fibrinogen B beta chain. After clotting with thrombin, this fibrin derivative lacking B beta 1 - 42 failed to support significant cell spreading. Spreading on fibrin was unaffected by depletion of Weibel-Palade bodies from endothelial cells, indicating that the spreading was independent of stimulated von Willebrand factor release. We conclude that endothelial cell spreading on fibrin requires <b>fibrinopeptide</b> B cleavage and involves residues 15 - 42 of the fibrin beta chain...|$|R

Before the gel point was reached, no systemic difference was observed between the data obtained after activation with thrombin which releases both <b>fibrinopeptides</b> A and B from fibrinogen, and reptilase, which exclusively releases the <b>fibrinopeptides</b> A.

These biobanks may contain relevant information about the disease process, response to therapy or patient classifications especially with respect to long-term follow-up that is otherwise very difficult to obtain based on newly initiated studies, particularly in the case of slowly developing diseases. An important parameter that may influence the composition of serum but that is often not exactly known is clotting time. We therefore investigated the influence of clotting time on the protein and peptide composition of serum by label-free and stable-isotope labeling techniques. The label-free analysis of trypsin-digested serum showed that the overall pattern of LC-MS data is not affected by clotting times varying from 2 to 8 h. However, univariate and multivariate statistical analyses revealed that proteins that are directly involved in blood clot formation, such as the clotting-derived <b>fibrinopeptides,</b> change significantly. This is most easily detected in the supernatant of acid-precipitated, immunodepleted serum. Stable-isotope labeling techniques show that truncated or phosphorylated forms of <b>fibrinopeptides</b> A and B increase or decrease depending on clotting time. These patterns can be easily recognized and should be taken into consideration when analyzing LC-MS data using serum sample collections of which the clotting time is not known. Next to the <b>fibrinopeptides,</b> leucine-rich alpha- 2 -glycoprotein (P 02750) was shown to be consistently decreased in samples with clotting times of more than I h.

An improved method for the separation of <b>fibrinopeptides</b> A and B by h. p. l. c. was developed, and this method was used to study the effect of thrombomodulin on the thrombin-catalysed cleavage of fibrinogen.

In the presence of thrombomodulin, the rate of inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin III was stimulated 4 -fold. This stimulation showed saturation kinetics with respect to thrombomodulin. Thrombomodulin was found to compete with hirudin for a binding site on thrombin.

We {{examined}} {{the relation between}} the level of urinary <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A and the presence of angiographic intracoronary thrombus in patients with unstable angina to determine whether this marker predicts active thrombus formation. Background. Although it is known that thrombus plays a role in acute ischemic syndromes, a noninvasive method to predict its presence in individual patients with unstable angina has not been determined. <b>Fibrinopeptide</b> A is a polypeptide cleaved from fibrinogen by thrombin and thus is a sensitive marker of thrombin activity and fibrin generation. Methods. Angiographic thrombus, graded 0 to 4, and the presence of ST segment depression or T wave inversions, or both, on the electrocardiogram (ECG) were related to <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A levels in 24 patients with rest angina of new onset, 18 with crescendo angina, 19 with stable angina and 9 with chest pain but without coronary artery disease. All patients had chest pain within the 24 h of sample acquisition. Results. The angiographic incidence of thrombus was significantly higher in patients with new onset of rest angina (67 %, p < 0. 001) and crescendo angina (50 %, p < 0. 001) as were <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A levels (p = 0. 002). <b>Fibrinopeptide</b> A levels correlated significantly (p < 0. 001) with the presence of a filling defect (grade 4 intracoronary thrombus) or contrast staining (grade 3). All patients with <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A ≥ 8 ng/mg creatinine showed grade 3 to 4 thrombus and 15 of 16 patients with levels ≥ 6. 0 ng/mg creatinine exhibited angiographic evidence of thrombus (13 with grades 3 to 4). Patients with reversible ST changes on the ECG had significantly higher levels of <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A (p < 0. 001), and ST changes correlated significantly with the presence of angiographic thrombus (p < 0. 001). Nonetheless, a significant minority of patients with unstable angina had neither angiographic nor biochemical evidence of thrombus. Conclusions. Elevated <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A levels in unstable angina reflected active intracoronary thrombus formation and were present in patients with angina of new onset as well as crescendo angina. Reversible ST changes are accompanied by thrombin activity and angiographic thrombus formation.

Myocardial infarction admission values (8. 4 ± 10. 0 ng/mg creatinine) were higher than those in the control (p = 0. 005) and stable angina (p < 0. 001) groups, but not higher than those in the unstable angina group. Peak values (the highest of multiple samples) were higher in the unstable angina group (7. 6 ± 5. 9 ng/mg creatinine) than in the stable angina group (4. 0 ± 1. 0 ng/mg creatinine) (p = 0. 04), but not in the control group (4. 5 ± 1. 9 ng/mg creatinine) (p = 0. 056). The two patients with unstable angina with the highest peak values subsequently exhibited infarction. Peak values in patients with infarction (44. 5 ± 60. 0 ng/mg creatinine) were significantly higher than those in patients with unstable (p = 0. 03) or stable (p = 0. 002) angina and control patients (p < 0. 001). urinary <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A levels were elevated in 10 (48 %) of 21 unstable angina admission samples, 10 (53 %) of 19 unstable angina peak samples, 6 (50 %) of 12 myocardial infarction admission samples and 10 (91 %) of 11 infarction peak samples. No patient with stable angina had an elevated urinary <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A value, and 2 of 12 control patients had a slightly elevated peak value. This study shows that spot urine <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A levels are elevated in virtually all patients with myocardial infarction and approximately half of the patients with unstable angina. Serial sampling demonstrates dynamic changes in <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A levels in patients with myocardial infarction, reflecting dynamic thrombin activity. Patients with unstable angina whose condition progresses to myocardial infarction have been shown to exhibit a similar dynamic tendency. Serial spot urinary <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A sampling, an easy method of sample acquisition, may be helpful in identifying those patients with unstable angina who have symptoms due to intracoronary artery thrombus formation and who are at the greatest risk of progressing to myocardial infarction...|$|R

40|$|Magnetically induced {{birefringence}} {{was used}} to monitor fibrin polymerization {{after the release of}} the small negatively charged A <b>fibrinopeptides</b> from human fibrinogen by the action of the snake-venom-derived enzymes reptilase and ancrod. A range of conditions was investigated. Fibrin polymerization in solutions of purified fibrinogen shows a distinct break near the gelation point. On addition of Ca 2 + or albumin the lag period is shortened, fibre thickness is increased and the break in assembly almost vanishes, probably because both of these additives promote lateral aggregation. There are minor differences in the kinetics, depending on the venom enzyme used. The kinetics of fibrin assembly in model systems containing either Ca 2 + or albumin and in human plasma with a largely dormant coagulation cascade are very similar. Therefore in the latter condition there is no significant alteration in the assembly process due to interaction between fibrin or the venom enzymes and any of the plasma proteins. When the cascade is activated, the polymerization progress curves have a character that resembles a combination of the reactions observed when the venom enzymes and endogenously generated thrombin separately induce coagulation, except for a region near gelation where, paradoxically, polymerization appears to be slower on activation. The low-angle neutron-diffraction patterns from oriented gels made with thrombin or reptilase are identical. Therefore at low resolution the packing of the monomers within fibres is the same when fibrinopeptide A only or both <b>fibrinopeptides</b> A and B are removed...|$|E

Here, we describe a model of how the assembly process occurs. Five kinds of interaction are explicitly defined, including two different knob–hole interactions, an end-to-end association between γ-chains, a lateral association between γ-chains, and a hypothetical lateral interaction between β-chains. The last two of these interactions are responsible for protofibril association and are predicated on intermolecular packing arrangements observed in crystal structures of fibrin double-D fragments cocrystallized with synthetic peptides corresponding to the knobs exposed by {{the release of the}} <b>fibrinopeptides</b> A and B...|$|E

The present {{study was designed to}} determine if the same abnormal phenotype was also present in the intraplatelet fibrinogen pool. Fresh platelets were washed in buffers containing EDTA until it could be shown that all washable plasma fibrinogen was removed. Normal platelets were then lysed by freezing and thawing to release their intracellular proteins, which were then treated with thrombin. The <b>fibrinopeptides,</b> cleaved from the intraplatelet fibrinogen, could be detected by an optimized h. p. l. c. technique. Quantification of the intraplatelet fibrinogen gave a result (means +/- S. D., n = 5) of 110 +/- 30 and 90 +/- 30 micrograms/ 10 (9) platelets, when determined by h. p. l. c. quantification of fibrinopeptide B content and fibrinogen fragment E radioimmunoassay respectively. Examination of <b>fibrinopeptides</b> released from the platelet fibrinogen from the family with fibrinogen Manchester with the same techniques showed elution peaks in the same positions as both [His 16]fibrinopeptide A and normal fibrinopeptide A. The identity of these peaks was further substantiated by analysis of the h. p. l. c. peaks by using specific radioimmunoassay to fibrinopeptide A. Our results therefore demonstrate that platelet fibrinogen expresses the heterozygous A alpha 16 His phenotype. This supports the view that the A alpha chains of platelet and plasma fibrinogen are produced from a single genetic locus...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurpose: We {{investigated}} {{the hypothesis that}} fibrinogen increased DNA synthesis (and cell proliferation) of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) cultured from human saphenous vein and that the increased DNA synthesis was attenuated when cells were cultured on polymeric collagen. Methods: SMCs were cultured from human saphenous vein on plastic, fibronectin, monomeric, and polymeric collagen. Fibrinogen products were prepared by proteolytic digestion. DNA synthesis was measured by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation into DNA, cell proliferation by cell counting, cyclic adenosine monophosphate by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and <b>fibrinopeptide</b> B labeled with iodine 125 used for binding studies. Results: Fibrin monomer (0. 003 - 0. 1 μmol/L) stimulated a concentration-dependent increase in DNA synthesis of up to 10 -fold, which could be inhibited by the peptide Bβ 15 - 42. The stimulation of DNA synthesis was highest for cells cultured on plastic and lowest for cells cultured on type I collagen polymer. Much higher concentrations of fibrinogen (0. 3 - 1 μmol/L) were required to effect similar increases in DNA synthesis. Fibrinogen had a particular effect to augment DNA synthesis, up to 14 -fold, when cells were cultured on monomeric type I collagen. This augmented DNA synthesis was inhibited by a neutralizing antibody to urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Incubation of cells cultured on collagen monomer with fibrinogen resulted in production of <b>fibrinopeptide</b> B. <b>Fibrinopeptide</b> B (5 μmol/L) increased DNA synthesis by fourfold and had additive effects with fibrin monomer to increase DNA synthesis. Iodinated tyrosine <b>fibrinopeptide</b> B bound to SMCs (dissociation constant 0. 6 μmol/L). Conclusion: Cultured human saphenous vein SMCs appear to have high-affinity receptors for fibrin monomer and <b>fibrinopeptide</b> B, the engagement of which stimulates DNA synthesis. These mechanisms may be pertinent to the association between fibrinogen and vein graft stenosis in vivo. (J Vasc Surg 2001; 33 : 847 - 53. ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{two-dimensional}} echocardiography, {{we studied}} the pathophysiology of intracardiac thrombus regression accompanied by anticoagulant therapy in 82 consecutive patients with acute cardiogenic cerebral embolism. We noted intracardiac thrombus in 15 patients; {{nine of the}} 15 were started on anticoagulant therapy with warfarin potassium to maintain the prothrombin time between 2. 5 and 3. 5 (international normalized ratio). Serial two-dimensional echocardiograms were obtained for these nine patients before and after anticoagulation, with the plasma levels of <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A, <b>fibrinopeptide</b> B/ 315 - 42, and D-dimer measured at the same time. In eight of the nine patients the intracardiac thrombi gradually decreased in size while the plasma level of <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A fell to within the normal range and the plasma levels of <b>fibrinopeptide</b> B/ 315 - 42 and D-dimer remained above the normal ranges. In the other patient the thrombus disappeared, with embolization to the right arm immediately after starting anticoagulant therapy. Mobile or small thrombi regressed earlier than nonmobile or large ones. We conclude that regression of intracardiac thrombi after anticoagulation may {{be based on the}} relative predominance of plasma fibrinolytic activity over anticoagulation-inhibited thrombin activity. (Stroke 1990; 21 : 1540 - 1544) Intracardiac thrombi can often be detected by serialtwo-dimensional echocardiography in patientswith acute cardiogenic cerebral embolism. 1 A number of recent studies 1 - 11 have shown that intracar-diac thrombi can regress during anticoagulant therapy in patients with or without cerebral embolism. The mechanism for this regression, however, has not been fully elucidated. We addressed this issue in nine pa-tients with cerebral embolism and intracardiac throm-bus by administering anticoagulants and taking serial two-dimensional echocardiograms at short intervals that paralleled measurements of prothrombin time and the plasma levels of <b>fibrinopeptide</b> A, fibrinopeptid...|$|R
