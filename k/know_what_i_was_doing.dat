500|$|Forbidden Zone {{featured}} Bright's first work on film, and {{his only}} {{work as an}} actor (under the name [...] "Toshiro Baloney"). A {{founding member of the}} Mystic Knights, Bright later became a screenwriter and director in his own right. Bright's credits include Freeway, Ted Bundy, and Tiptoes. Bright and director Richard Elfman's only dispute during the screenwriting process was over a scene in which his character, Squeezit, was originally to have been beaten up for eight minutes and having the walls wiped with his blood. Another scene cut from the script would have had Squeezit being castrated. According to Bright, [...] "I didn't have any sense of limits or balance then, at the time, I... you know, I was just, didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> I needed reining in." [...] During filming, Bright was sitting on the set in costume when a lighting stand fell onto his head, cracking his skull, and he had to be rushed to the hospital. When Bright returned to work the next day, he had a mild concussion and whiplash, but he continued with filming.|$|E
500|$|... "Bop Gun" [...] {{marked the}} first episode in its new time slot on Thursdays at 10 p.m., occupying a period {{previously}} filled by L.A. Law. The show previously aired 9 p.m. on Wednesdays, where it was regularly defeated in the ratings by the ABC comedy Home Improvement. [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was written by David Mills and David Simon based on a story by Fontana. It was directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal, a feature director then-best known for such films as Waterland (1992) and A Dangerous Woman (1993). It was the first television script written by Mills, who previously worked as a reporter and became friends with Simon while studying journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park. Mills said of [...] "Bop Gun", [...] "That script inspired me to quit journalism. It was a golden opportunity, even though I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> I developed bad habits as a newspaper feature writer. I would always stretch a project to fill the available time." [...] "Bop Gun" [...] served as a departure from previous Homicide: Life on the Street episodes by focusing more strongly on a murder victim, {{rather than on the}} detectives. Simon felt the script's dialogue, particularly the detectives' use of dark humor as a coping mechanism for dealing with the horrors of the homicide unit, were faithful to reality. He particularly cited the scene in which Felton angers Ellison by talking excitedly about how much overtime he expected to get. Simon said, [...] "That's a conversation that would happen. It would happen in any homicide unit in America, and when I saw it actually being acted out I got a real kick in the pants because I thought, 'Wherever there are homicide detectives watching this, they're cracking up because they know how true it is.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Scott Speedman, {{the actor}} who portrays Michael in the franchise, about how his [...] "personal lack of gun {{knowledge}} worked in his favor"; [...] "I get to carry a gun once in the movie and I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> and that was appropriate. I'm the [...] "girlfriend". Every time I've got this shocked look {{on my face and}} she throws me to the ground. I'm screaming in terror. When I was watching it I was like, [...] "Wow, how weird." [...] I'm fine with it. I'm glad I didn't have to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> with guns. That was easy for me".|$|E

2500|$|The main {{character}} in Sylvia Plath's novel, The Bell Jar, is morbidly {{interested in the}} Rosenbergs' case.

2500|$|In {{the last}} hours, Buford was {{attended}} by his aide, Captain Myles Keogh, and by Edward, his black servant. Also present were Lieutenant Colonel A. J. Alexander and General Stoneman. His wife Pattie was traveling from Rock Island, Illinois, but would not arrive in time. Near the end, he became delirious and began admonishing the servant, but then, {{in a moment of}} clarity, called for the man and apologized: [...] "Edward, I hear that I have been scolding you. I did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> You have been a faithful servant, Edward." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Waterston, Anderson did {{not have}} a clear goal while on set but it did not feel chaotic. Brolin {{expressed}} similar feelings saying that [...] "It was crazy, chaotic but really, really gratifying." [...] Brolin also stated that there was [...] "a really strange lack of pretense" [...] but that Anderson would work with the actors when they felt something was not working. Pieterse stated that Anderson allowed [...] "freedom and flexibility to really dive into your character and shape the scene". Wilson said [...] "Sometimes I wouldn't necessarily <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> We were encouraged to kind of do anything." ...|$|E

2500|$|May {{spoke about}} this {{incident}} years later, saying, [...] "the first thing I knew I was being fired {{on from the}} rear ... all I could do was try to dodge my attacker. I noticed it was a red tri-plane, but if I realized it was Richthofen, I would have probably {{passed out on the}} spot. I kept on dodging and spinning, I imagine from about 12,000 feet until I ran out of sky and had to hedge hop over the ground. Richthofen was firing at me continually, [...] the only thing that saved me was my poor flying. I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> myself and I do not suppose that Richthofen could figure out what I was going to do".|$|E
2500|$|The {{second season}} doubled the running {{time of the}} first from 11 minutes to 22 minutes; {{according}} to Weidenfeld in an interview with USA Today, this was done in accordance with the network's expanding timeslot. Neely stated that [...] "I think we decided, in concert with the network, that it would benefit the show. The show kept growing, and our storytelling style and structure just needed more room. I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> when I was writing in the 11-minute format; I was just cramming 22 minutes in there." [...] Weidenfeld considered the first season [...] "essentially 10 mini-pilots" [...] converging into a larger show. He stated that the network thought the increase in length led to a [...] "perfect fit" [...] for the show's expanding universe. He stated that he and his crew had developed up to 300 named characters which will be inserted throughout the series.|$|E
