25|$|If the {{flashing}} body {{is set on}} fire and rushes violently to the Earth it is called a thunderbolt; if it is only half of fire, but violent also and massive, it is called a meteor; if it is entirely free from fire, it is called a smoking bolt. They are all called 'swooping bolts' because they swoop down upon the Earth. Lightning is sometimes smoky, and is then called 'smoldering lightning"; sometimes it darts quickly along, and is then said to be vivid. At other times, it travels in crooked lines, and is called <b>forked</b> <b>lightning.</b> When it swoops down upon some object it is called 'swooping lightning'.|$|E

2500|$|Arkady Kamanin, Nikolai's son, {{was born}} in 1928. He {{spent most of his}} {{childhood}} on the airfields and at an early age could identify most of the Soviet military airplanes by the engine's sound alone. After the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War, Arkady worked at one of the aircraft plants in Moscow. Later in 1941, he was evacuated to Tashkent with his mother and younger brother Leo, where they lived until the spring of 1943. In the middle of spring of 1943 he arrived at Andreapol airfield (Kalininsky battlefront), where his father's air division was quartering. Formally enlisted at the age of 14, Arkady served as a mechanic at a liaison squadron, where he learned practical flying skills by hitchhiking rides with real pilots, whom he asked to let him steer. After he managed to land a Polikarpov Po-2 by himself when the pilot was wounded by shrapnel, he passed the official examinations for piloting the Po-2, becoming the youngest pilot of World War II at the age of 15. Soon after that he was granted his personal Po-2 with <b>forked</b> <b>lightning</b> painted on fuselage. On one of these flights, Arkady managed to save the wounded Lieutenant Berdnikov, who crash-landed his damaged IL-2 near the front line, while retrieving the plane's reconnaissance film and returning safely to the base. For his excellent service, Arkady Kamanin received two combat Orders of the Red Star, the Order of the Red Banner, the Medal [...] "For the Victory over Germany in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945", the Medal [...] "For the Capture of Budapest" [...] and the Medal [...] "For the Capture of Vienna". After the war Arkady decided to enter the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy, wanting to learn to fly new types of aircraft. Arkady Kamanin died of meningitis on April 13, 1947, at the age of 18.|$|E

60|$|Even as he spoke, {{the clouds}} were parted at last with a {{dazzling}} blaze of <b>forked</b> <b>lightning.</b> The girl {{gave a little}} cry and held out her hands.

5000|$|The [...] "dry" [...] season lasts from May to September, with {{an average}} of less than 3 inches of rain falling per month. The driest month of the year is July. Though overall {{precipitation}} in August is low, this is also the month with the most thunderstorms (both [...] "wet" [...] and [...] "dry"). These storms are often accompanied by sheet lightning; <b>fork</b> <b>lightning</b> is rare. June and early July tend to be cloudy or overcast in the morning, with the cloud cover burning off as the day goes on. The hottest time of the day tends to be in the late afternoon, between 2 and 4 pm. Houses with air-conditioning are few and far between, so on the rare days when the temperature soars above 85 degrees, locals tend to flock to the water or places known to have air-conditioning, such as the movie theater. Kopachuck State Park is an especially popular destination for those with neither air-conditioning, nor waterfront access. The hottest months are July and August, which both have average lows in the mid-50s and an average high of 75 °F.|$|R
60|$|Still on we sailed: {{and after}} many {{tranquil}} days and nights, a storm came down, and burst its thousand bombs. The <b>lightnings</b> <b>forked</b> and flashed; the waters boiled; our three prows lifted themselves in supplication; but the billows smote {{them as they}} reared.|$|R
60|$|Heavy {{drops of}} rain, {{followed}} immediately by a <b>forked</b> flash of <b>lightning</b> and sharp rattling thunder compelled her, willingly or no, {{to accept his}} invitation.

60|$|There was a lurid calm {{about the}} old man's face as he asked this {{question}} that was very dreadful in its intensity. Under the shadow of his thick black eyebrows, gleams of light glinted and flickered in the expanded pupils, as before the outburst of a tempest the <b>forked</b> <b>lightning</b> flickers {{in the belly of}} the cloud. His voice too was constrained and harsh.|$|E
60|$|That event was, indeed, {{the arrival}} of a ship, but it did not arrive in the manner that had been expected. It came in the dead of a dark night, when the {{elements}} seemed to have declared fierce war against each other, for it was difficult to say whether the roaring of the sea, the crashing of the thunder, or the flashing of the <b>forked</b> <b>lightning</b> was most tremendous.|$|E
5000|$|She was {{described}} as [...] "a very sharp clipper and said {{to be one of}} the most perfect ships ever built". [...] "No expense was spared to make her one of the most perfect and beautiful ships ever built. The bow raked boldly forward, flaring gracefully, and was ornamented with a beautiful carved female figure with <b>forks</b> of <b>lightning</b> playing around She was very sharp, with a long, clean run tapering like that of a pilot boat. Her light and graceful stern was ornamented with carved work surrounding a figure of Neptune. She had a fine sheer, and every line and molding harmonized her whole length." ...|$|R
60|$|Lingard turned round sharply. Willems and Aissa stopped. Another <b>forked</b> {{flash of}} <b>lightning</b> split up the clouds overhead, and threw upon their faces a sudden burst of light--a blaze violent, {{sinister}} and fleeting; {{and in the}} same instant they were deafened by a near, single crash of thunder, which was followed by a rushing noise, like a frightened sigh of the startled earth.|$|R
60|$|The world {{never saw}} the like of that wrestling match betwixt the king and the Demon, for they {{struggled}} and strove together from the seventh hour {{in the morning to}} the sunset in the evening, and during that time the sky was clouded over as black as night, and the <b>lightning</b> <b>forked</b> and shot, and the thunder roared and bellowed, and the earth shook and quaked.|$|R
60|$|Then from zenith to horizon {{the sky was}} cracked with <b>forked</b> <b>lightning,</b> and the wet {{atmosphere}} {{turned to}} a horrid green. The rain, beginning gently, in dead calm, grew into a deluge of enormous streaming drops. It grew darker and darker, a green darkness, and in the cabin, although it was midday, Wada and the steward lighted lamps. The lightning came closer and closer, until the ship was enveloped in it. The green darkness was continually a-tremble with flame, through which broke greater illuminations of <b>forked</b> <b>lightning.</b> These became more violent as the rain lessened, and, so absolutely were we centred in this electrical maelstrom, there was no connecting any chain or flash or fork of lightning with any particular thunder-clap. The atmosphere all about us paled and flamed. Such a crashing and smashing! We looked every moment for the Elsinore to be struck. And never had I seen such colours in lightning. Although from moment to moment we were dazzled by the greater bolts, there persisted always a tremulous, pulsing lesser play of light, sometimes softly blue, at other times a thin purple that quivered on into a thousand shades of lavender.|$|E
60|$|For {{the wind}} had now risen to such a height that the leaves and {{branches}} of the trees were carried about in vast whirls and eddies, while {{the waters of the}} lake, where in serener hours Ferdinand was accustomed to bathe, were lifted out of their bed, and inundated the neighbouring settlements. Lights were now seen moving in the cottages, and then the <b>forked</b> <b>lightning,</b> pouring down at the same time from opposite quarters of the sky, exposed with an awful distinctness, and a fearful splendour, the wide-spreading scene of danger and devastation.|$|E
60|$|Turner {{was always}} fond of this neat, courageous, benevolent, merry, methodical Deal. He painted it very early, in the Southern Coast series, insisting {{on one of}} the tavern windows as the {{principal}} subject, with a flash of <b>forked</b> <b>lightning</b> streaming beyond it out at sea like a narrow flag. He has the same association in his mind in the present plate; disorder and distress among the ships on the left, with the boat going out to help them; and the precision of the little town stretching in sunshine along the beach.|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{where the}} quick Rhone thus hath cleft his way, [...] The mightiest of the storms hath ta'en his stand; [...] For here, not one, but many, make their play, [...] And fling their thunderbolts {{from hand to}} hand, [...] Flashing and cast around: of all the band, [...] The {{brightest}} through these parted hills hath <b>forked</b> [...] His <b>lightnings,</b> {{as if he did}} understand [...] That in such gaps as desolation worked, There the hot shaft should blast whatever therein lurked.|$|R
60|$|Ascending to Khersiong, I {{found the}} {{vegetation}} very backward by the road-sides. The rain had cleared the atmosphere, {{and the view}} over the plains was brilliant. On {{the top of the}} Khersiong spur a tremendous gale set in with a cold west wind: the storm cleared off at night, which at 10 p.m. was beautiful, with <b>forked</b> and sheet <b>lightning</b> over the plains far below us. The equinoctial gales had now fairly set in, with violent south-east gales, heavy thunder, lightning, and rain.|$|R
6000|$|... § LXXIII. The fifth element above named was RIGIDITY; {{and this}} {{character}} I must endeavor carefully to define, for neither the word I have used, {{nor any other}} that I can think of, will express it accurately. For I mean, not merely stable, but active rigidity; the peculiar energy which gives tension to movement, and stiffness to resistance, which makes the fiercest <b>lightning</b> <b>forked</b> rather than curved, and the stoutest oak-branch angular rather than bending, and is as much seen in the quivering of the lance as in the glittering of the icicle.|$|R
60|$|Fearful {{of taking}} shelter beneath {{a tree or}} hedge, {{the old man and}} the child hurried along the high road, hoping to find some house in which they could seek a refuge from the storm, which had now burst forth in earnest, and every moment {{increased}} in violence. Drenched with the pelting rain, confused by the deafening thunder, and bewildered by the glare of the <b>forked</b> <b>lightning,</b> they would have passed a solitary house without being aware of its vicinity, had not a man, who was standing at the door, called lustily to them to enter.|$|E
60|$|If the 6.50 {{down-train}} {{had been}} a flash of <b>forked</b> <b>lightning</b> transfixing him to the earth, he could scarcely have remained in a more trance-like state. He still leant against the railings, his right hand still continued pressing on his walking-stick, his weight on one foot, his other heel raised, his eyes wide open towards the blackness of the cutting. The only movement in him was a slight dropping of the lower jaw, separating his previously closed lips a little way, as when a strange conviction rushes home suddenly upon a man. A new surprise, not nearly so trivial as the first, had taken possession of him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Majesty, {{whatever}} actuated you, it was {{a stroke}} of diplomacy," [...] replied her brother. [...] "Stewart has got good stuff in him. He was down and out. Well, he's made a game fight, and {{it looks as if}} he'd win. Trusting him, giving him responsibility, relying upon him, was the surest way to strengthen his hold upon himself. Then that little touch of sentiment about being your kind of cowboy and protecting you--well, if Gene Stewart doesn't develop into an Argus-eyed knight I'll say I don't know cowboys. But, Majesty, remember, he's a composite of tiger breed and <b>forked</b> <b>lightning,</b> and don't imagine he has failed you if he gets into a fight.|$|E
6000|$|Let us hear Hazlitt: [...] "Pope saw nature only dressed by art; he judged {{of beauty}} by fashion; he sought for {{truth in the}} {{opinions}} of the world; he judged the feelings of others by his own. The capacious soul of Shakspeare had an intuitive and mighty sympathy with whatever could enter into the heart of man in all possible circumstances; Pope had an exact knowledge of all that he himself loved or hated, wished or wanted. Milton has winged his daring flight from heaven to earth, through Chaos and old Night; Pope's Muse never wandered in safety, but from his library to his grotto, or from his grotto into his library, back again. His mind dwelt with greater pleasure on his own garden than on the garden of Eden; he could describe the faultless whole-length mirror that reflected his own person, better than the smooth surface of the lake that reflects the face of heaven; a piece of cut glass or pair of paste-buckles with more brilliancy and effect than a thousand dewdrops glittering in the sun. He would be more delighted with a patent lamp than with the 'pale reflex of Cynthia's brow,' that fills the sky with the soft silent lustre that trembles through the cottage window, and cheers the mariner on the lonely wave. He was the poet of personality and polished life. That which was nearest to him was the greatest. His mind was the antithesis of strength and grandeur; its power was the power of indifference. He had none of the enthusiasm of poetry; he was in poetry what the sceptic is in religion. In his smooth and polished verse we meet with no prodigies of nature, but with miracles of wit; the thunders of his pen are whispered flatteries; its <b>forked</b> <b>lightnings,</b> pointed sarcasms; for the 'gnarled oak,' he gives us the 'soft myrtle;' for rocks, and seas, and mountains, artificial grass-plots, gravel-walks, and tinkling rills; for earthquakes and tempests, the breaking of a flower-pot or the fall of a China jar; for the tug and war of the elements, or the deadly strife of the passions, ...|$|R
60|$|An incessant <b>lightning,</b> <b>forked</b> and blue, showed {{all that}} {{there was to be}} seen on the little patch in the flood - a clump of thorn, a clump of swaying {{creaking}} bamboos, and a grey gnarled peepul overshadowing a Hindoo shrine, from whose dome floated a tattered red flag. The holy man whose summer resting-place it was had long since abandoned it, and the weather had broken the red-daubed image of his god. The two men stumbled, heavy-limbed and heavy-eyed, over the ashes of a brick-set cooking-place, and dropped down under the shelter of the branches, while the rain and river roared together.|$|R
60|$|Majesty surmounted {{the last}} few steps and, snorting, halted beside Stewart's black. To Madeline the scene {{was as if the}} world had changed. The ridge was a mountain-top. It dropped before her into a black, stone-ridged, shrub-patched, many-canyoned gulf. Eastward, beyond the gulf, round, bare mountain-heads loomed up. Upward, on the right, led giant steps of cliff and bench and {{weathered}} slope to the fir-bordered and pine-fringed crags standing dark and bare against the stormy sky. Massed inky clouds were piling across the peaks, obscuring the highest ones. A <b>fork</b> of white <b>lightning</b> flashed, and, like the booming of an avalanche, thunder followed.|$|R
6000|$|... 1420. As to {{the result}} itself, we see its effect in every {{electric}} spark; {{for it is}} not the whole quantity which passes that determines the discharge, but merely that small portion of force which brings the deciding molecule (1370.) up to its maximum tension; then, when its forces are subverted and discharge begins, all the rest passes by the same course, from the influence of the favouring circumstances just referred to; and whether it be the electricity on a square inch, or a thousand square inches of charged glass, the discharge is complete. Hereafter we shall find the influence of this effect in the formation of brushes (1435.); and it is not impossible that we may trace it producing the jagged spark and the <b>forked</b> <b>lightning.</b>|$|E
60|$|A {{flash of}} <b>forked</b> <b>lightning</b> leaped {{from the sky}} and touched the lake, there was a long, {{rumbling}} peal, and then a humming noise began astern. Angry white ripples splashed about the canoe and lumps of hail beat Lister's head. Then, while the thunder rolled across the sky, the canoe swerved. It was blowing hard, the high bow and stern caught the wind, the strength was needed to hold her straight with the single paddle. If he brought her round, he could not paddle to windward, and to steer across the sea that would soon get up might be dangerous. They must make the point and land. He threw Ruth his jacket, for spray had begun to fly and the drops from the paddle blew on board.|$|E
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} the storm generally freshened up a bit, {{and we were}} kept pretty busy rushing about with towels and cloths, trying to prevent the water from coming into the rooms and swamping us. During tea-time the saloon was usually illuminated by <b>forked</b> <b>lightning.</b> The evenings we spent in baling out the boat, after which we took it in turns {{to go into the}} kitchen and warm ourselves. At eight we supped, and from then {{until it was time to}} go to bed we sat wrapped up in rugs, listening to the roaring of the thunder, and the howling of the wind, and the lashing of the waves, and wondering whether the boat would hold out through the night.|$|E
40|$|Do not go gentle {{into that}} good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

6000|$|At 5 P. M. we {{weathered}} Point Dyánye, garnished, like Nyonye, with {{a threatening}} line of breakers; the boat-passage along shore was about 400 yards wide. Darkness came on shortly after six o'clock, and the sultry weather {{began to look}} ominous, with a huge, angry, black nimbus discharging itself into the glassy livid sea northwards. I suggested landing, but Lángobúmo was positive that the storm had passed westwards, and he objected, with some reason, that in the outer gloom the boat might be dashed to pieces. As we had not even a stone for an anchor, the plea proved, valid. We guided ourselves, by the fitful flashes of <b>forked</b> and sheet <b>lightning</b> combined, towards a ghostly point, whose deeper blackness silhouetted it against the shades. Suddenly the boat's head was turned inland; a huge breaker, foaming along our gunwales, drove us forwards like the downwards motion of a [...] "swing-swong," [...] and, before we knew where we were, an ugly little bar had been crossed {{on the top of}} the curling scud. We could see the forest on both sides, but there was not light enough to trace the river line; I told Hotaloya to tumble out; [...] "Plenty shark here, mas'r," [...] was the only answer. We lost nearly half an hour of most valuable time in pottering and groping before all had landed.|$|R
