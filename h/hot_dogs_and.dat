25|$|The {{industrial}} use of mechanical meat shredding was the technical advance that helped popularize the Hamburg steak. The first meat grinder {{was invented in}} the early 19th century by the German engineer Karl Drais. The machine {{made it possible for}} minced meat to be sold at market in large quantities at reasonable prices. By 1845, numerous patents existed for improved meat grinders in the United States. These machines could all shred meat to sizes before unimaginable. Before this, minced meat was prepared by hand at home using specialized chisels, intensive manual labor that severely limited the amount that could be produced. It is very likely that the invention of the meat grinder contributed directly to the popularization of Hamburg steak, while the steak gradually became distant from its German roots {{in the minds of many}} Americans. Minced meat also came to be used in other popular American foods, including <b>hot</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>and</b> meatloaf.|$|E

500|$|The name [...] "Cincinnati chili" [...] {{is often}} {{confusing}} to those unfamiliar {{with it because}} the term [...] "chili" [...] evokes the expectation of chili con carne, which it [...] "bears no resemblance to." [...] Cincinnati chili is a Mediterranean-spiced meat sauce for spaghetti or <b>hot</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>and</b> is very seldom eaten by the bowl as is typical with chili con carne. It is common for Cincinnatians to describe it starting with, [...] "Well, it's not really chili..." [...] Cincinnati chili is always seasoned with cinnamon, allspice, cloves, cumin, nutmeg, and chili pepper. Many recipes call for {{a small amount of}} dark unsweetened chocolate, but according to Dann Woellert, author of The Authentic History of Cincinnati Chili, [...] "There is no chili parlor in Cincinnati that uses chocolate in its chili." [...] It is normally of a thin consistency, closer to a soup than a stew, and contains no chunks of meat or vegetables, though it is common to find large pieces of cayenne pepper hulls in Empress chili. The consistency, seasonings, and serving method are more similar to pasta sauce or the spiced meat sauces used to top hot dogs in Rochester and other parts of Upstate New York, Rhode Island, and Michigan than they are to chili con carne.|$|E

He became ill while there, and suffered relapses during spring training. Ruth collapsed in Asheville, North Carolina, as the team journeyed north. He was put on a train for New York, where he was briefly hospitalized. A rumor circulated that he had died, prompting British newspapers to print a premature obituary. In New York, Ruth collapsed again and was found unconscious in his hotel bathroom. He was taken to a hospital where he suffered multiple convulsions. After sportswriter W. O. McGeehan wrote that Ruth's illness was due to binging on <b>hot</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>and</b> soda pop before a game, it became known as [...] "the bellyache heard 'round the world". However, the exact cause of his ailment has never been confirmed and remains a mystery. Glenn Stout, in his history of the Yankees, notes that the Ruth legend is [...] "still one of the most sheltered in sports"; he suggests that alcohol was at the root of Ruth's illness, pointing to the fact that Ruth remained six weeks at St. Vincent's Hospital but was allowed to leave, under supervision, for workouts with the team for part of that time. He concludes that the hospitalization was behavior-related. Playing just 98 games, Ruth had his worst season as a Yankee; he finished with a [...]290 average and 25 home runs. The Yankees finished next to last in the AL with a 69–85 record, their last season with a losing record until 1965.|$|E
