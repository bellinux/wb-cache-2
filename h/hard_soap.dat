5000|$|Depending on {{the nature}} of the alkali used in their production, soaps have {{distinct}} properties. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) gives [...] "hard soap"; <b>hard</b> <b>soaps</b> can also be used in water containing Mg, Cl, and Ca salts. By contrast, when potassium hydroxide (KOH) is used, a soft soap is formed. The fatty acid source also affects the soap's melting point. Most early <b>hard</b> <b>soaps</b> were manufactured using animal fats and KOH from wood ash; these were broadly solid. However, the majority of modern soaps are manufactured from polyunsaturated triglycerides such as vegetable oils. As in the triglycerides they are formed from the salts of these acids have weaker inter-molecular forces and thus lower melting points.|$|R

He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of <b>hard</b> <b>soap</b> on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.|$|E

5000|$|Shaving soap is {{produced}} like a traditional soap with an ingredient selection oriented to producing a stable, slick lather. Its manufacture often differs slightly from normal bath soap in that both potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide {{may be used}} as saponification agents. Sodium hydroxide creates a <b>harder</b> <b>soap</b> such as is used in pucks, where potassium hydroxide facilitates creation of a softer soap which loads on the brush more easily. [...] Historically, tallow has been a popular ingredient in shaving soaps and is still in use in some traditional products. Palm oil is frequently used as a substitute for tallow where animal fats are not desired. Other oils such as coconut oil are commonly used. Component fatty acids such as stearic acid are also used in shaving soaps for the properties which they contribute; stearic acid contributes to a more stable dense lather.|$|R
50|$|A <b>hard</b> shaving <b>soap</b> is {{used with}} a shaving brush to create lather for shaving. For soap {{in the form of}} a puck or bar, the brush is first soaked in water and then swirled vigorously over the surface of the soap, causing moist soap to coat the brush's bristles. The brush is then {{transferred}} either to a separate bowl or to the shaver's face to be lathered.|$|R
50|$|Hard shaving soaps {{in their}} modern form have existed {{since at least}} the early 19th century. Williams (a common American shaving soap {{intended}} for use in a mug rather than a scuttle) has been produced since 1840, and a US patent for a shaving scuttle for use with a <b>hard</b> <b>soap</b> was granted in 1867.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hard</b> <b>soap</b> or {{curd soap}} {{is a kind}} of soap; {{examples}} are Aleppo soap, Castile soap, and Marseille soap or savon de Marseille. During the preparation of the soap, common salt (sodium chloride) is added to the liquid soap mass. This leads to the soap mass separating from glycerin, resulting in a harder soap. It can also be made using sodium hydroxide.|$|E
50|$|Aleppo soap (also {{known as}} savon d'Alep, laurel soap, Syrian soap, or ghar soap, the Syrian word for 'laurel') is a handmade, hard bar soap {{associated}} {{with the city of}} Aleppo, Syria.

25|$|<b>Hard</b> toilet <b>soap</b> with a {{pleasant}} smell {{was produced in}} the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age, when soap-making became an established industry. Recipes for soap-making are described by Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (854–925), who also gave a recipe for producing glycerine from olive oil. In the Middle East, soap was produced from the interaction of fatty oils and fats with alkali. In Syria, soap was produced using olive oil together with alkali and lime. Soap was exported from Syria, {{to other parts of}} the Muslim world and to Europe.|$|R
50|$|The task {{of doing}} laundry {{had begun to}} change with the {{introduction}} of washing powders in the 1880s. Until that time, laundry was done using <b>hard</b> bar <b>soap,</b> washboards, and the repeated beating and wringing of the clothing items. The success of several of the new washing powders had proven that there was a ready market for what the consumer believed to be better and more economical cleaning agents. Most of these new products, however, were simply pulverized soap and fell short of having any significant improvement in doing the laundry.|$|R
50|$|It is {{also the}} main {{component}} of soap scum, a white solid that forms when soap is mixed with <b>hard</b> water. Unlike <b>soaps</b> containing sodium and potassium, calcium stearate is insoluble in water and does not lather well.Commercially it is sold as a 50% dispersion in water or as a spray dried powder. As a food additive it is known by the generic E number E470.|$|R
50|$|Adding brine to the boiled liquor {{made the}} soap float to the surface, where the soap-boiler could skim it off, leaving the excess lye and {{impurities}} to settle out.

50|$|Shaving soap {{typically}} {{refers to}} a <b>hard</b> <b>soap</b> that is whipped into a lather using a shaving brush. The lather it produces is used to coat the face during shaving, providing protection and lubrication for the razor. Among cartridge razor users, shaving soap has largely been displaced by canned shaving foam or gel, but hard shaving soaps are still utilized by users of double-edge safety razors and straight razors.|$|E
5000|$|Marseille soap [...] or Savon de Marseille is a {{traditional}} <b>hard</b> <b>soap</b> made from vegetable oils that has been produced around Marseille, France, for about 600 years. The first documented soapmaker was recorded there in about 1370. By 1688, Louis XIV introduced regulations in the Edict of Colbert limiting {{the use of the}} name savon de Marseille to olive oil based soaps. [...] The law has since been amended to allow other vegetable oils to be used.|$|E
50|$|With an {{increasing}} number of homes incorporating indoor plumbing, Drackett saw a need for a good chemical drain opener. Clogs are largely caused by grease and hair going down the drain. Lye turns grease into soap, a process known as saponification, but in <b>hard</b> water, <b>soap</b> curdles, adding to the problem. One approach was to use concentrated nitric acid, or sulfuric acid. These attack both hair and soap curd, and generate heat as well, but they also attack metal pipes. Drackett used a mixture of dry lye crystals and aluminum pellets, producing much heat. When he used machined shards of aluminum instead of smooth aluminum beads, the sharp aluminum in churning mix physically would cut through most ordinary clogs, yet the aluminum was soft enough to not cut into metal pipes.|$|R

She also states that Jacqui is very loyal and the most loyal character out of the McQueen family. Speaking of Jacqui's time away from forefront plots Cooper has said: [...] "I think that Jacqui's one of those characters who, if she isn't on screen for a while, it takes the audience time to warm to her again. But when they do, they find her funny, they find her interesting and I try to give them as much as I can." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{cubes of}} soap are then stacked in {{staggered}} cylinders to allow maximum air exposure. Once they have dried sufficiently, they {{are put into}} a special subterranean chamber to be aged for {{six months to a}} year.While it is aging, the soap goes through several chemical changes. First, and most importantly, the free alkaline content of the soap (the alkaline which did not react with the oil during saponification) breaks down upon slow reaction with air. The moisture content of the soap is also reduced, making the <b>soap</b> <b>hard</b> and long lasting. And lastly, the color of the outside of the soap turns a pale gold, while the inside remains green.|$|R

50|$|A diverse {{agricultural}} production {{is at the}} heart of the Afrin Canton economy, traditionally in particular olives, and more recently there was a focus on increasing wheat production. A well-known product is Aleppo soap, a <b>hard</b> <b>soap</b> made from olive oil and lye, distinguished by the inclusion of laurel oil. While Afrin Canton has been the source of olive oil for Aleppo soap since antiquity, the destruction caused by the Syrian Civil War to other parts of Aleppo governorate has increasingly made the entire production chains locate in Afrin Canton. At the height of the fighting for Aleppo, up to 50 percent of the city's industrial production was moved to Afrin Canton. As of early 2016, two million pairs of jeans were produced per month and exported across Syria. In January 2017, 400 textile industry workshops counted 17,000 employees, supplying the whole of Syria.|$|E
40|$|Mangrove {{products}} have been historically {{used by many}} indigenous populations in tropical coastal areas worldwide. One {{of these is the}} use of mangrove ashes to extract alkali for soap production. However, until recent times, few examples of industrial uses (i. e. transformation of raw material by artificial, non-artisanal means into secondary products) of mangrove were restricted to the use of tannins in the leather industry (Lacerda, 1999). We report here one of the first, if not the very first, example of industrial use of mangrove products, which was also {{regarded as one of the}} initial steps in the development of the Brazilian chemical industry: the development in the early 19 th century of an industrial process of <b>hard</b> <b>soap</b> production based on mangrove leaves ash in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Lacerda, 1999). Soap has been known by mankind for about 2, 000 years, as a mixture of alkali and fatty materials, in general animal fat. Before the invention of the Le Blanc and more recently the Solvay process of saponification, natural sources of alkali were obtained by evaporation of naturally alkaline waters, relatively rare and time consuming or the leaching of bulk wood ash, which gave very low yields. These two sources hampered the development of an actual, large-scale industrial process of soap making, keeping its production as an artisanal method for millennia (Shreve & Brink, 1977). In this context, mangroves played a key, but unsuspected role in the industrial production of soap and in the development of 19 th century Brazilian chemical industry. On 25 th January 1812...|$|E

50|$|Total {{fatty matter}} (TFM) {{is one of}} the most {{important}} characteristics describing the quality of soap and it is always specified in commercial transactions. It is defined as the total amount of fatty matter, mostly fatty acids, that can be separated from a sample after splitting with mineral acid, usually hydrochloric acid. The fatty acids most commonly present in soap are oleic, stearic and palmitic acids and pure, dry, sodium oleate has TFM 92.8%, while top quality soap noodles now increasingly used for making soap tablets in small and medium size factories, are typically traded with a specification TFM 78% min., moisture 14% max. But besides moisture, finished commercial soap, especially laundry soap, also contains fillers used to lower its cost or confer special properties, plus emollients, preservatives, etc. and then the TFM can be as low as 50%. Fillers, which are usually dry powders, also make the <b>soap</b> <b>harder,</b> harsher on the skin and with greater tendency to become 'mushy' in water and so low TFM is usually associated with hardness and lower quality. In older days in Europe and in some countries now, soap with TFM 75% minimum was referred to as Grade 1 and 65% minimum as Grade 2 and less 60% as Grade 3.|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of producing a}} highly competitive water-soluble <b>hard</b> <b>soap</b> fortified with O. gratissimum extract (Ts) which will inhibit the growth and activity of Candida and staphylococci was investigated in comparison to a commercial standard soap (Ss) and the control soap without an extract (Cs).
