The start of the <b>Holy</b> <b>Year</b> in December 1899 attracted the religious to the city, but also brought threats from anarchists and other anticlericals. Police received warnings of an anarchist bombing of the theatre, and instructed Mugnone (who had survived a theatre bombing in Barcelona), that in an emergency he was to strike up the royal march. The unrest caused the premiere to be postponed by one day, to 14January.|$|E

They met Wesley Fishel, an American academic consultant for the U.S. government. Fishel was a proponent of the anti-colonial, anti-communist third force doctrine in Asia and was impressed by Diệm. He helped the brothers organise contacts and meetings in the United States to enlist support.|$|E
25|$|In 1928 the Governatorato of Rome asked {{architect}} Adolfo Pernier {{to restore}} the building, which for the <b>holy</b> <b>year</b> of 1925 had been painted in yellow. The architect after an accurate survey brought the palace back to its original early 16th century pristine condition, removing all the later additions, including the balcony along Via del Sant'Uffizio. Only three years later, after {{the signing of the}} Lateran treaties, the edifice had to be pulled down {{in the wake of the}} definition of the border between Italy and the newly established state of Vatican City.|$|E
50|$|Chía and Sué {{formed the}} basis of the complex Muisca calendar, where synodic and sidereal months were taken into account in three types of years; rural years of 12 or 13 months, common years of 20 months and <b>holy</b> <b>years</b> of 37 months. Weeks with weekly markets were 4 days, making every month 7 weeks.|$|R
5000|$|According to Duquesne, the Muisca {{used their}} 'perfect' number gueta; a century {{consisted}} of 20 <b>holy</b> <b>years</b> (20 times 37 months; 740) which equals almost 60 Gregorian years. The same scholar {{referred to a}} [...] "common century" [...] (siglo vulgar) comprising 20 times 20 months. Pedro Simón, as described by Izquierdo Peña, found two different centuries; {{in the northern part}} of the Muisca Confederation (capital Hunza) and in the south, capital Bacatá. It is hypothesized by Izquierdo Peña that this apparent difference was due to a typo in the chronicles of Simón. Combining the different analyses by the scholars over time, Izquierdo Peña found the arrival of Bochica, described by Pedro Simón to have occurred 14800 months and the dream of Bochica to supposedly have happened 20 Bxogonoa or 2000 <b>holy</b> <b>years</b> (consisting of 37 months) before the time of description. In the Gregorian calendar this equates to 6166.7 years.|$|R

25|$|Further {{calendar}} reforms {{occurred during}} the later Sassanid era. Ever since the reforms under Ardashir I {{there had been no}} intercalation. Thus with a quarter day being lost each year, the Zoroastrian <b>holy</b> <b>year</b> had slowly slipped backwards, with Nowruz eventually ending up in July. A great council was therefore convened and it was decided that Nowruz be moved back to the original position it had during the Achaemenid period - back to spring. This change probably took place during the reign of Kavad I in the early 6th century. Much emphasis seems to have been placed during this period on the importance of spring and on its connection with the resurrection and Frashegerd.|$|E
25|$|The Miraflores Altarpiece was {{probably}} commissioned by King JuanII of Castile, since JuanII donated {{it to the}} monastery of Miraflores in 1445. In the <b>holy</b> <b>year</b> 1450 Rogier quite possibly made a pilgrimage to Rome which brought him in contact with Italian artists and patrons. The House of Este and the Medici family commissioned paintings from him. After interventions from both the Duke of Burgundy and the Dauphin of France, the future LouisXI, Rogier van der Weyden was persuaded to accept the request of Bianca Maria Visconti, Duchess of Milan, that her court painter Zanetto Bugatto go to Brussels to become an apprentice in his workshop. Rogier's international reputation had increased progressively. In the 1450s and 1460s humanist scholars such as Nicolas Cusanus, Filarete and Bartolomeo Facio referred to him in superlatives: 'the greatest', 'the most noble' of painters.|$|E
25|$|Diệm {{applied for}} {{permission}} to travel to Rome for the <b>Holy</b> <b>Year</b> celebrations at the Vatican. After gaining French permission, he left in August 1950 with his older brother, Bishop Ngô Đình Thục. Before going to Europe, Diệm went to Japan, where he met with Prince Cường Để, his former ally, and discussed Cường Để's efforts to return to Vietnam and his capacity to play some roles in his homeland. Diệm's friend also managed to organize a meeting between him and Wesley Fishel, an American {{political science professor at}} University of California who was working for CIA in Japan. Fishel was a proponent of the anti-colonial, anti-communist third force doctrine in Asia and was impressed with Diệm and helped him organize connections in the United States. In 1951, Diệm flew to the United States to seek the support of government officials. Nevertheless, Diệm was not successful in winning the US support for Vietnamese anti-communists. He continued on and flew to Europe.|$|E

A large gathering was organized in 1871 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his papacy. The Italian government in 1870 outlawed many popular pilgrimages. The faithful of Bologna organized a nationwide [...] "spiritual pilgrimage" [...] to the pope and the tombs of the apostles in 1873.

2500|$|The mosaic was {{commissioned}} by Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi, whose donor portrait was {{to the right of}} Christ's feet; {{he was in charge of}} Rome after Pope Clement V and the Curia left the city in March 1309 at the beginning of the period of the Avignon Papacy. [...] The commission was connected with the <b>Holy</b> <b>Year</b> of 1300, and used to be dated closer to that but is now usually regarded as having been produced after a visit by Giotto to Rome in about 1310, in which he is presumed to have created a cartoon for specialist mosaic-workers to follow. [...] The mosaic probably replaced a Late Antique one in the same location, but nothing is known about this. [...] According to Stefaneschi's obituary of 1347, the work cost 2,200 florins. [...] The earliest references to the work as by Giotto are in a Vatican necrology entry for Cardinal Stefaneschi recording his death in 1343, and then the Latin chronicle of Giotto's home city Florence written in the late 14th century by Filippo Villani.|$|E

50|$|The {{religion}} of the Muisca contained various deities who were based on cosmological and environmental factors (Cuchavira; rainbow, Chibchacum; rain, Nencatacoa; fertility).

His children were the god of the Sun; Sué and his wife, the goddess of the Moon; Chía. Both deities served {{as the basis for the}} complex lunisolar Muisca calendar, having different divisions for synodic and sidereal months.
