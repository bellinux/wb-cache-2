On January 3, 2008, he reversed himself, however, and decided to run in presidential elections. In response, his top campaign official Giorgi Zhvania (brother of Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania) resigned, declaring that Patarkasishvili did not have the unquestionable reputation one would <b>expect</b> <b>of</b> a country's president.|$|E

She unselfishly does what others <b>expect</b> <b>of</b> her, doing things like helping Charley escape their father to go to school, and living with Jenny Wren. Marrying Wrayburn is the only truly selfish act Lizzie commits in Our Mutual Friend, and even that is debatable, since she only did it because Wrayburn appeared to be on his deathbed.|$|E

25|$|Very little can be {{said about}} Ba Zaw’s works in spite of his great {{influence}} on Burmese painting because, to date, only about five of his works have surfaced. Three of the works are watercolors on permanent display {{in the collection of the}} National Museum of Myanmar, one of which appears in Ranard’s Burmese Painting: A Linear and Lateral History. It is a watercolor landscape bearing the orange, brown and yellowish tones that one might <b>expect</b> <b>of</b> a painter influenced by J. J. Hilder. The works in the National Museum have historical importance, but they cannot be called remarkable.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, in 1562, another {{writer from}} the Engadine, Durich Chiampel, {{published}} the Cudesch da Psalms, {{a collection of}} church songs in the Vallader dialect. These early works are generally well written and show that the authors had {{a large amount of}} Romansh vocabulary at their disposal, contrary to what one might <b>expect</b> <b>of</b> the first pieces of writing in a language. Because of this, the linguist Ricarda Liver assumes that these written works built on an earlier, pre-literature tradition of using Romansh in administrative and legal situations, of which no evidence survives. In their prefaces, the authors themselves often mention the novelty of writing Romansh, and discuss an apparently common prejudice that Romansh was a language that could not be written.|$|E
25|$|The Dieppe Raid of 1942 {{had shown}} that the Allies could not rely {{on being able to}} {{penetrate}} the Atlantic Wall to capture a port on the north French coast. The problem was that large ocean-going ships of the type needed to transport heavy and bulky cargoes and stores needed sufficient depth of water under their keels, together with dockside cranes, to off-load their cargo and this was not available except at the already heavily-defended French harbours. Thus, the Mulberries were created to provide the port facilities necessary to offload the thousands of men and vehicles, and tons of supplies necessary to sustain Operation Overlord and the Battle of Normandy. The harbours were made up of all the elements one would <b>expect</b> <b>of</b> any harbour: breakwater, piers, roadways etc.|$|E

25|$|On {{the topic}} of {{predictable}} probabilities, the double-slit experiments are a popular example. Photons are fired one-by-one through a double-slit apparatus at a distant screen. Curiously, they do not arrive at any single point, nor even the two points lined up with the slits (the way you might <b>expect</b> <b>of</b> bullets fired by a fixed gun at a distant target). Instead, the light arrives in varying concentrations at widely separated points, {{and the distribution of}} its collisions with the target can be calculated reliably. In that sense the behavior of light in this apparatus is deterministic, but {{there is no way to}} predict where in the resulting interference pattern any individual photon will make its contribution (although, there may be ways to use weak measurement to acquire more information without violating the Uncertainty principle).|$|E
25|$|In the Test arena, Taylor's {{performances}} were somewhat below {{what one would}} <b>expect</b> <b>of</b> a player at Test level. However, this was attributed to his young age and premature elevation to the national team. However, since Zimbabwe's return to the Test circuit, Taylor has shown remarkable maturity, both as the side's leading batsman and captain. He scored two Test centuries and when he scored a century in the fourth innings of the Test match against New Zealand, on a fifth day pitch, (inclusive of 5 huge sixes), he became the second Zimbabwean after Arnott to score a fourth-innings century in a Test match. Taylor has announced that his team will continue to play aggressive, attacking test cricket which drew widespread praise from all quarters. He also scored two half-centuries, 71 against Bangladesh and 50 against New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|A Celebration of Harry Potter is {{an annual}} three-day weekend event {{held on the}} last weekend of January at both Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure, celebrating the fandom of the Harry Potter books {{authored}} by J. K. Rowling and the film series based on the books, in a collaboration between Universal Parks & Resorts, Warner Bros. Entertainment and Scholastic. The event, introduced on the weekend of January 24–26, 2014, features film talent Q sessions, panels, special demonstrations, photo-ops, exhibitions from Pottermore, Scholastic, graphic designer company MinaLima and film props and costumes brought in from the Warner Bros. Studio Tour London in Leavesden and the touring Harry Potter exhibition. During the event's debut in 2014, the Diagon Alley expansion of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios Florida was still under construction at the time, raising an expectation among the celebration's attendees at what to <b>expect</b> <b>of</b> the new area of the theme park, which was set to open that same year. Since the event's debut, actors from the films who have attended the celebration include: Matthew Lewis, James and Oliver Phelps, Evana Lynch, Devon Murray, Mark Williams, Michael Gambon, Robbie Coltrane, Rupert Grint, Bonnie Wright, Katie Leung, Tom Felton, Jason Isaacs and Warwick Davis.|$|E

The essential thrill is always to keep eluding what is expected of us and what we <b>expect</b> <b>of</b> ourselves."

But, you know, {{at the end of}} the day, in Storybrooke, she’s still trying to fill this void that Maleficent warned her about." [...] Leading up to the episode broadcast, Parrilla also gave a preview of what viewers could <b>expect.</b> <b>Of</b> the episode's plot, she explained, [...] "We will be seeing some dirty politics between Regina and Mr. Gold.
