40|$|AbstractA {{combined}} DFT/electrostatic {{approach is}} employed {{to study the}} coupling of proton and electron transfer reactions in cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) and its proton pumping mechanism. The coupling of the chemical proton to the internal electron transfer within the binuclear center is examined for the O→E transition. The novel features of the His 291 pumping model are proposed, which involve timely well-synchronized sequence of the proton-coupled electron transfer reactions. The obtained pKas and Ems of the key ionizable and redox-active groups at the different stages of the O→E transition are consistent with available experimental data. The PT step from <b>E</b> <b>242</b> to H 291 is examined in detail for various redox states of the hemes and various conformations of <b>E</b> <b>242</b> side-chain. Redox potential calculations of the successive steps in the reaction cycle during the O→E transition are able to explain a cascade of equilibria between the different intermediate states and electron redistribution between the metal centers {{during the course of}} the catalytic activity. All four electrometric phases are discussed in the light of the obtained results, providing a robust support for the His 291 model of proton pumping in CcO.

Its catalytic properties are closely related with unique posttranslational modifications of its prosthetic group. In MPO, modified heme b is covalently bound to the protein via two ester linkages and one sulfonium ion linkage with a strong impact on its(electronic) structure and biophysical and chemical properties. Here, the thermodynamics of the one-electron reduction of the ferric heme in wild-type recombinant MPO and variants withdisrupted heme−protein bonds (M 243 V, <b>E</b> <b>242</b> Q, and D 94 V) have been investigated by thin-layer spectroelectrochemistry. Itturns out that neither the oligomeric structure nor the N-terminal extension in recombinant MPO modifies the peculiar positivereduction potential (E°′ = 0. 001 V at 25 °C and pH 7. 0) or the enthalpy or entropy of the Fe(III) to Fe(II) reduction. Bycontrast, upon disruption of the MPO−typical sulfonium ion linkage, the reduction potential is significantly lower (− 0. 182 V). The M 243 V mutant has an enthalpically stabilized ferric state, whereas its ferrous form is entropically favored because {{of the loss of}} rigidity of the distal H-bonding network. Exchange of an adjacent ester bond (<b>E</b> <b>242</b> Q) induced similar but less pronouncedeffects (E°′ = − 0. 094 V), whereas in the D 94 V variant (E°′ = − 0. 060 V), formation of the ferrous state is entropically disfavored.

In addition, the stability and solubility of a passenger protein can often be improved by fusing it to MBP. In a previous comparison with two other highly soluble fusion partners, MBP was decidedly superior at promoting the solubility {{of a range of}} aggregation-prone proteins. To explain this observation, we proposed that MBP could function as a general molecular chaperone {{in the context of a}} fusion protein by binding to aggregation-prone folding intermediates of passenger proteins and preventing their self-association. The ligand-binding cleft in MBP was considered a likely site for peptide binding because of its hydrophobic nature. We tested this hypothesis by systematically replacing hydrophobic amino acid side chains in and around the cleft with glutamic acid. None of these mutations affected the yield or solubility of MBP in its unfused state. Each MBP was then tested for its ability to promote solubility when fused to three passenger proteins: green fluorescent protein, p 16, and E 6. Mutations within the maltose-binding cleft (W 62 E, A 63 E, Y 155 E, W 230 E, and W 340 E) had little or no effect on the solubility of the fusion proteins.

Mathematical models can represent {{our knowledge of the}} underlying mechanisms, and numerical methods can then facilitate analysis, which forms the foundation for a more integrated understanding as well as for design and intervention. Here, the intracellular molecular network responsible for the mammalian circadian clock system was studied. A new formulation of detailed sensitivity analysis is introduced and applied to elucidate the influence of individual rate processes, represented through their parameters, on network functional characteristics. One of four negative feedback loops in the model, the Per 2 loop, was uniquely identified as most responsible for setting the period of oscillation; none of the other feedback loops were found to play as substantial a role. The analysis further suggested that the activity of the kinases CK 1 d and CK 1 e were well placed within the network such that they could be instrumental in implementing short-term adjustments to the period in the circadian clock system.

40|$|AbstractIdentification of the {{locations}} of protonatable sites in cytochrome c oxidase that are influenced by reactions in the binuclear centre is critical to assessment of proposed coupling mechanisms, and to controversies on where the pumping steps occur. One such protonation site is that which governs interconversion of the isoelectronic 607 nm ‘PM’ and 580 nm ‘F⋅’ forms of the two-electron-reduced oxygen intermediate. Low pH favours protonation of a site that is close to an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) -silent radical species in PM, and this induces a partial electronic redistribution to form an EPR-detectable tryptophan radical in F⋅. A further protonatable group that must {{be close to the}} binuclear centre has been detected in bacterial oxidases by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy from pH-dependent changes in the haem-bound CO vibration frequency at low temperatures. However, in bovine cytochrome c oxidase under similar conditions of measurement, haem-bound CO remains predominantly in a single 1963 cm− 1 form between pH 6. 5 and 8. 5, indicating that this group is not present. Lack of pH dependence extends to the protein region of the CO photolysis spectra and suggests that both the reduced and the reduced/CO states do not have titratable groups that affect the binuclear centre strongly in the pH range 6. 5 – 8. 5.

In developing countries like India, the obesity and underweight are very important risk factors for maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of maternal BMI on the pregnancy outcome and perinatal outcome. Methods: our study included 504 antenatal cases attending OPD in Sultania Zanana hospital, Bhopal, India in their first trimester in their first visit, from the period of July 2014 to June 2015. BMI of the cases calculated and categorized the women in five groups as per WHO and National Institute of Health guidelines 1 - 2 and they were followed up in their subsequent visits in relation to any pregnancy complication and perinatal outcome. Results: It was observed that majority of women 402 (79. 7 %) were between the age group of 20 - 25 years.

The three active Cry 1 Aa mutants at pH 10. 5, as well as D 222 A at pH 7. 5, demonstrated a faster rate of pore formation than Cry 1 Aa, suggesting that increases in molecular flexibility due to the removal of a salt bridge facilitated toxin insertion into the membrane.

CcO is found to be capable of holding plenty of water, which in subunit I alone amounts to about 165 molecules. The dynamic characterization of these water molecules is carried out. The nascent water molecules produced in the redox reaction at the heme a 3 –CuB binuclear site form an intriguing chain structure. The chain begins at the position of Glu 242 {{at the end of the}} D channel, and has a fork structure, one branch of which leads to the binuclear center, and the other to the propionate d of heme a 3. The branch that leads to the binuclear center has dynamic access both to the site where the formation of water occurs, and to delta-nitrogen of His 291. From the binuclear center, the chain continues to run into the K channel. The stability of this hydrogen bond network is examined dynamically. The catalytic site is located at the hydrophobic region, and the nascent water molecules are produced at the top of the energy hill. The energy gradient is utilized as the mechanism of water removal from the protein. The water exit channels are explored using high-temperature dynamics simulations. Two putative channels for water exit from the catalytic site have been identified. One is leading directly toward Mg 2 + site. However, this channel is only open when His 291 is dissociated from CuB.

This indicates that in MV-CO there is a group proximal to heme a that deprotonates with a pKa of about 8. 3, but that remains protonated over the entire pH* range 6 – 9. 3 in FR-CO. The pKa of this group is therefore strongly coupled to the redox state of heme a. Following photodissociation of CO from heme a 3 in MV oxidases, the extent of electron transfer from heme a 3 to heme a shows a pH-dependent phase between pH 7 and 9, and a pH-independent phase at all pH's. The FTIR difference spectrum resulting from photolysis of MV-CO exhibits vibrational features of the protein backbone and side chains associated with (1) the loss of CO by the a 3 heme in the absence of electron transfer, (2) the pH-independent phase of the electron transfer, and (3) the pH-dependent phase of the electron transfer. Many infrared features change intensity or frequency during both electron transfer phases and thus appear as positive or negative features in the difference spectra. In particular, a negative band at 1735 cm− 1 and a positive band at 1412 cm− 1 are consistent with the deprotonation of the acidic residue <b>E</b> <b>242.</b> Positive features at 1552 and 1661 cm− 1 are due to amide backbone modes. Other positive and negative features between 1600 and 1700 cm− 1 are consistent with redox-induced shifts in heme formyl vibrations, and the redox-linked protonation of an arginine residue, accompanying electron transfer from heme a 3 to heme a. An arginine could be the residue responsible for the pH-dependent shift in the carbonyl frequency of MV-CO. Specific possibilities as to the functional significance of these observations are discussed...|$|E

O ciclo biológico dessas espécies é conhecido em condições de laboratório, sendo poucos estudos em ecótopos silvestres. Para analisar a infestação e estrutura de populações de Rn e Pt em ninhos de aves presentes na palmeira Mauritia flexuosa Linnaeus, em duas estações climáticas do Brasil Central, foram amostradas 41 palmeiras com evidências de nidificação de Phacellodomus ruber Vieillot, 1817 (22 na estação chuvosa e 19 na estação seca) em quatro áreas do Distrito Federal. Os insetos foram capturados usando-se coleta manual na copa da palmeira, identificados morfologicamente, separados por sexo e estádio ninfal. Fezes e glândulas salivares de Rn foram examinadas para verificar infecção por Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas, 1909 e/ou T. rangeli Tejera, 1920. Trinta e cinco palmeiras com ninhos de P. ruber estavam infestadas por Rn (85 %) e 22 por Pt (53 %). 442 indivíduos foram coletados na estação seca (200 Rn <b>e</b> <b>242</b> Pt) e 267 na estação chuvosa (136 Rn e 131 Pt). O único fator relacionado significativamente com a densidade de triatomíneos nas palmeiras foi a área. A estrutura etária das populações mostrou: a) maior abundância de adultos nas populações de Pt, b) maior abundância de machos em ambas as espécies e c) presença de fêmeas ovipondo em ambas as estações. Nenhum dos 177 triatomíneos examinados estava infectado por T. cruzi ou T. rangeli. A estrutura etária das populações de Rn e Pt não diferiu significativamente entre as estações amostradas, indicando ausência de marcada sazonalidade para essas espécies.

The insects were collected by manual capture in the crown of palms, identified, separated by sex and immature stages. Faeces and salivary glands of Rn were examined to verify Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas, 1909 and/or T. rangeli Tejera, 1920 infection. Thirty five palm trees with P. ruber nests were infested by Rn (85 %) and 22 by Pt (53 %). 442 insects were collected in the dry season (200 Rn and 242 Pt) and 267 in the wet season (136 Rn and 131 Pt). The area was the only factor related with triatomine density in palm trees. The population structure showed: a) higher abundance of adults in Pt populations, b) higher abundance of males in both species and, c) females laying eggs in both seasons.

Os suplementos foram balanceados para atingirem 20 % PB, com base na matéria natural. Avaliaram-se, no primeiro experimento, as variáveis ganho médio diário (GMD - kg/dia), rendimento de carcaça quente (RC - %) e peso de carcaça (PC - kg). Foram utilizados 12 novilhos mestiços Holandês-Zebu, com idade e peso médios iniciais de 24 meses e 361 kg, manejados em três piquetes (3 ha) de Brachiaria decumbens, recebendo 4 kg/cab/dia de suplemento.

Empregaram-se os suplementos descritos inicialmente, acrescentando-se tratamento englobando a fonte protéica grão de soja moído (GSOM). Foram utilizados cinco novilhos mestiços, fistulados no rúmen, mantidos em piquete (3 ha) de Brachiaria decumbens, os quais receberam 4 kg/cab/dia de suplemento. As mensurações foram {{realizadas}} 0, 2, 4 e 6 horas após a suplementação. O pH ruminal foi afetado por suplementos, sendo observadas quedas significativas somente em FSOJA, não ocorrendo, contudo, níveis danosos à microbiota ruminal. Os níveis amoniacais médios para ALG, GSOI e GSOM foram de 7, 23; 6, 91; e 6, 74 mg/dL, respectivamente, não diferindo entre si, sendo inferiores ao FSOJA (9, 51 mg/dL). Two {{experiments were}} conducted to evaluate multiple supplements containing whole soybean (GSOI) and cottonseed (ALG) in relation to standard supplement of corn grain plus soybean meal (FSOJA) in crossbred steers finished at pasture, in the dry season. The supplements were balanced to reach the level of 20 % CP, as fed basis. In the first experiment, average daily gain (ADG - kg/day), hot carcass dressing (CD -%) and carcass weight (CW - kg) were evaluated. Twelve Holstein-Zebu crossbred steers, averaging 24 months old and initial weight of 361 kg, were used and managed in three paddocks (3 ha each) of Brachiaria decumbens pasture, daily fed 4 kg of supplement per animal. The observed values of ADG, CD and CW were: 1. 056, 52. 21 and 241. 20; 1. 016, 53. 04 and 242. 55; and 1. 137, 53. 61 and 247. 65, respectively, for the supplements GSOI, ALG and FSOJA, that showed to be equivalent. The objective of the second experiment was to evaluate {{the influence of the}} supplements on the behavior of ruminal pH and ammonia concentration. The supplements were those initially described, adding a treatment that included as protein source grinded soybean (GSOM). Five crossbred steers, fistulated in the rumen, grazing Brachiaria decumbens pasture and daily fed 4 kg of supplement, were used. The measures were performed at 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours after supplementation. The ruminal pH was affected by the supplements, and significant reductions were observed only for FSOJA, however, no harmful levels to the ruminal microbes were observed. The average ammonia levels for ALG, GSOI and GSOM were of 7. 23, 6. 91 and 6. 74 mg/dL, respectively, and did not differ from each other, but were inferior than FSOJA (9. 51 mg/dL) ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is part of}} a wider {{monitoring}} {{project of}} the agricultural soils in Lombardia, which aims to build a database of topsoil properties and the potentially toxic elements, organic pollutants and gamma emitting radionuclides that the topsoils contain. A total of 156 agricultural soils were sampled according to the LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey) standard procedure. The aim was to provide a baseline to document the conditions present at the time of sampling. The results of the project con- cerning soil radioactivity are presented here. The aim was to assess the content of 238 U, 232 Th, 137 Cs and 40 K by measuring soil samples by gamma spectrometry. 238 U, 232 Th and 40 K activities range 24 e 231, 20 <b>e</b> 70, and <b>242</b> <b>e</b> 1434 Bq kg! 1 respectively. The geographic distribution of 238 U reflects the geophysical framework of the Lombardia region: the soils with high content of uranium are distributed for the most part in the South Alpine belt, where the presence of magmatic rocks is widespread. These soils show an higher activity of 238 U than of 232 Th. The 238 U activities become lower than 232 Th when soils are located in the plain, originating from basic sedimentary rocks. 137 Cs activity ranges 0. 4 e 86. 8 kBq m! 2. The lowest activity of 137 Cs is in the plain, whereas the highest is in the North on soils kept as lawn or pasture. The 137 Cs activity of some samples suggests the presence of accumulation processes that lead to 137 Cs enriched soils. This is the first survey of gamma emitting radionuclides in Lombardia that is based on the LUCAS standard sampling. The results from this monitoring campaign are important for the human radiation exposure and provide the zero point, which will be useful for assessing future effects due to external factors such as human activities...|$|R

After CoNS isolation was confirmed by microbiological culture for both samples, all CoNS isolates (n = 108) were genotypically differentiated by PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of a partial groEL gene sequence and subjected to the MALDI-TOF MS identification procedure. MALDI-TOF MS correctly identified 103 (95. 4 %) of the CoNS isolates identified by PCR-RFLP at the species level. Eleven CoNS species isolated from bovine IMI were identified by PCR-RFLP, and the most prevalent species was Staphylococcus chromogenes (n = 80; 74. 1 %).

Leptospirosis is en {{endemic disease}} in Northeast of Brazil, which is {{characterized}} by potential fatal complications such as acute kidney injury (AKI). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the clinical manifestations, the AKI classification and the risk factors for death in patients with the severe form of leptospirosis. Methods. A retrospective study was conducted in patients with severe form of leptospirosis admitted to tertiary hospitals in Fortaleza city, Northeast of Brazil. The clinical manifestations, laboratory tests at admission and during hospital stay, as well as treatment, were evaluated. AKI was defined according to the RIFLE and AKIN classifications, and the patients in each category were compared. Patients who used and who did not use penicillin, as well as survivors and non-survivors, were compared. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to investigate the risk factors for death. Statistical analysis was done with SPSS program version 10. 0. Results. A total of 287 patients were included, with a mean age of 36. 8 Â 15. 6 years, and 80. 8 % were male. The main signs and symptoms at admission were fever (96. 2 %), myalgia (90. 6 %), jaundice (85. 7 %), headache (74. 2 %), vomiting (70. 7 %), dehydration (54 %) and chills (53. 7 %). AKI was observed in 237 patients (82 %) according to the RIFLE criteria and 242 (84 %) according to AKIN. General mortality was 13 %. Mortality was similar in patients who used and who did not use penicillin (11. 6 % vs. 13. 7 %, p= 0. 60). An increase in mortality was observed according to the worst classifications of RIFLE and AKIN: RIFLE-R (2 %), RIFLE-I (8 %) e RIFLE-F (23 %), AKIN 1 (2 %), AKIN 2 (8 %) e AKIN 3 (23 %), p< 0. 0001. Patients with oliguria had a higher mortality (20 %), when compared to those without oliguria (5 %), p= 0. 02. Independent risk factors for death were: RIFLE-F (OR= 10. 5, 95 % CI= 1. 3 - 80. 8, p< 0. 001), AKIN 3 (OR= 7. 5, 95 % CI= 2. 2 - 25. 2 p< 0. 001) and need of dialysis (OR= 3. 5, 95 % CI= 1. 1 - 11. 01, p= 0. 01). Conclusions. AKI is a frequent complication in leptospirosis, with significant mortality. There was association between RIFLE and AKIN classifications with mortality.

Consumption of bacteria by protozoa was measured by monitoring the disappearance of H- 3 -thymidine-labelled bacteria. Metazooplankton bacterivory was assessed using 0. 5 -mu m fluorescent microparticles (FMPs), and predation of metazooplankton on ciliates was measured using natural ciliate assemblages labelled with FMPs as tracer food. Grazing of metazooplanklon on flagellates was determined through in situ incubations with manipulated metazooplankton densities. Protozooplankton bacterivory varied between 6. 08 and 53. 90 mg C m(- 3) day(- 1) (i. e. from 0. 12 to 0. 86 g C- 1 bacteria g C- 1 protozoa day(- 1)). Metazooplankton, essentially rotfiers, grazing on bacteria was negligible compared with grazing by protozoa (similar to 1000 times lower). Predation of rotfiers on heterotrophic flagellates (HFs) was generally low (on average 1. 77 mg C m(- 3) day(- 1), i. e. 0. 084 g C- 1 flagellates g C- 1 rotfiers day(- 1)), the higher contribution of HF in the diet of rotfiers being observed when Keratella cochlearis was the dominant metazooplankter. Predation of rotfiers on ciliates was low in spring samples (0. 56 mg C m(- 3) day(- 1), i. e. 0. 014 g C- 1 ciliates g C- 1 rotfiers day(- 1)) in contrast to measurements performed in July (8. 72 mg C m(- 3) day(- 1), i. <b>e.</b> 0. <b>242</b> g C- 1 ciliates g C- 1 rotfiers day(- 1)).

30|$|This {{diversity}} is irreducible on two accounts. First, because every “human” soul has by nature, that is, by {{definition of what}} it is to be human, perceived real beings (249 e); and secondly, but more significantly, because no God can be treated truthfully as an evil (<b>242</b> <b>e).</b> Thus Socrates demands as an inflexible criterion of interpretation that every God be conceived as “the best and most beautiful thing possible” (Republic 381 c), which demands a polycentric interpretation of myth recognizing that conflict among Gods can only be understood as involving conflicting goods. It is this, and nothing like the “boorish wisdom” of the demythologizing sophists (Phaedrus 229 e), that leads Socrates to question a literal interpretation of theomachy in the Euthyphro (6 a–c). This irreducible diversity, in turn, because it is not unlimited diversity, prevents the existential privilege afforded every soul qua human from provoking a collapse into relativism. The principle embodied in the polytheistic and polycentric formation of this theophanic plane not only preserves the Gods, with each a unique and distinctive truth-preserving total perspective, from being written out of the text in favor of some singular totalizing perspective; it also urges, albeit with less force, a generalized hermeneutic of charity, such that “the word which the wise speak not be rejected, but we must see if they are right” (Phaedrus 260 a, quoting Iliad 2.361; trans.

In previous work, we {{have shown that the}} dominant contribution to catalysis comes from the monoprotonated form of oxalate binding to a form of the enzyme in which an active site carboxylic acid residue must be unprotonated. CsOxOx shares greatest sequence homology with bicupin microbial oxalate decarboxylases (OxDC) and the 241 - 244 DASN region of the N-terminal Mn binding domain of CsOxOx is analogous to the lid region of OxDC that has been shown to determine reaction specificity. We have prepared a series of CsOxOx mutants to probe this region and to identify the carboxylate residue implicated in catalysis. The pH profile of the D 241 A CsOxOx mutant suggests that the protonation state of aspartic acid 241 is mechanistically significant and that catalysis takes place at the N-terminal Mn binding site. The observation that the D 241 S CsOxOx mutation eliminates Mn binding to both the N- and C- terminal Mn binding sites suggests that both sites must be intact for Mn incorporation into either site.

Here we use a mutagenic approach to investigate the potential role of three of these threonine residues. Phosphomimetic mutations of two of these (T <b>242</b> <b>E</b> and T 244 E) resulted in significant reductions in virus genome replication and the production of infectious virus, suggesting that the phosphorylation of these residues negatively regulated virus RNA synthesis.

Effects of the mutations on the ratio of basally/hyperphosphorylated NS 5 A, together with the apparent molecular weight of the basally phosphorylated species were also observed. Lastly, two of the mutations (T 245 A and TripleE) resulted in a perinuclear restricted localization of NS 5 A.
