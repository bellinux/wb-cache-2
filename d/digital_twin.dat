In the IoT, physical objects are accompanied by Digital Twins: virtual, digital equivalents to physical objects. The interaction between real/physical and digital/virtual objects (<b>digital</b> <b>twins)</b> is an essential concept behind this vision. <b>Digital</b> <b>twins</b> can act as a central means to manage farms and has the potential to revolutionize agriculture. It removes fundamental constraints concerning place, time, and human observation. Farming operations would no longer require physical proximity, which allows for remote monitoring, control and coordination of farm operations. Moreover, <b>Digital</b> <b>Twins</b> can be enriched with information that cannot be observed (or not accurately) by the human senses, e. g. sensor and satellite data. A final interesting angle is that <b>Digital</b> <b>Twins</b> do not only represent actual states, but can also reproduce historical states and simulate future states.

30|$|We {{motivated}} that {{in order}} to handle adaptive open systems of systems, it is necessary to shift parts of the development activities from design time to runtime. Models at runtime provide the basic core concepts for doing so. And indeed, many approaches recently emerging for handling such systems hidden behind buzzwords such as Internet of Things, Cyber-Physical Systems, or Industry 4.0 actually rely on ideas similar to those of models at runtime. For example, the idea of Administration Shells and <b>Digital</b> <b>Twins</b> or <b>Digital</b> Shadows has emerged as one core concept for managing open systems of systems – particularly in the context of Industry 4.0. In principle, <b>digital</b> <b>twins</b> are model-based representations of entities of the real world such as machines, cars, or persons. So, in fact, <b>digital</b> <b>twins</b> are model-based representations reflecting the associated systems / things from a problem space perspective.

These important attributes are now optimized {{by trial and error}} because the essential process variables cannot currently be selected from scientific principles. A recourse is to build and rigorously validate a <b>digital</b> <b>twin</b> of the additive manufacturing process that can provide accurate predictions of the spatial and temporal variations of metallurgical parameters that affect the structure and properties of components. Key building blocks of a computationally efficient first-generation <b>digital</b> <b>twin</b> of laser-based directed energy deposition additive manufacturing utilize a transient, three-dimensional model that calculates temperature and velocity fields, cooling rates, solidification parameters and deposit geometry.

40|$|Fracture {{is largely}} a microstructure-based phenomenon, but for experimentalists, {{computational}} mechanicians, and fleet managers operating at the macroscale, this fact might seem inexplicable, inapplicable, or even inconsequential. The latter response is what the three chapters of this dissertation address. Together, they attempt to dispel the notion that microstructural effects do not translate in any useful way to the structural scale. They also present models which are verified and validated herein to ease this disconnect. These three chapters are individual papers submitted to refereed journals for publication. The paper in the first chapter appears in Engineering Fracture Mechanics (DOI: [URL] It generalizes the Park-PaulinoRoesler potential-based cohesive zone model to three-dimensions, a means to model fracture even under {{a high degree of}} mode-mixity at both the macro- and micro-scales. The generalization is validated against several material tests at the macroscale: T-Peel, MMB, ECT, and BDWT. Its ability to model intergranular fracture at the microscale is also explored. The paper in the second chapter fills a void in the <b>Digital</b> <b>Twin</b> community- it presents {{for the first time a}} straight-forward use case which both clarifies and motivates this new paradigm in fleet management. Specifically, ductile fracture is modeled in a non-standardized specimen which fails along one of two likely crack paths. This crack path ambiguity, the result of grain-size deviations in specimen geometry, underpins the importance of considering as-manufactured component geometry in the design, assessment, and certification of structural systems, a cornerstone of <b>Digital</b> <b>Twin.</b> It also highlights the limitations of a continuum plasticity damage model in resolving accurately this ambiguity particularly close to the bifurcation, on the order of a few grain sizes, and motivates the need to consider crack nucleation at the microscale. The paper in the third chapter demonstrates <b>Digital</b> <b>Twin</b> at the microscale. It details the implementation, verification, and validation of a microstructure-based, <b>Digital</b> <b>Twin</b> framework which accounts for the predominant microcrack nucleation mechanism in the nickel-based superalloy LSHR.

Rappel  Multi-scale {{methods for}} fracture: model {{learning}} across scales, <b>digital</b> <b>twinning</b> and factors of safety Fracture and material instabilities originate at spatial scales {{much smaller than}} that of the structure of interest: delamination, debonding, fibre breakage, cell-wall buckling, are examples of nano/micro or meso-scale mechanisms which can lead to global failure of the material and structure. Such mechanisms cannot, for computational and practical reasons, be accounted at structural scale, so that acceleration methods are necessary.   We review in this presentation recently proposed approaches to reduce the computational expense associated with multi-scale modelling of fracture. In light of two particular examples, we show connections between algebraic reduction (model order reduction and quasi-continuum methods) and homogenisation-based reduction. We open the discussion towards suitable approaches for machine-learning and Bayesian statistical based multi-scale model selection. Such approaches could fuel a digital-twin concept enabling models to learn from real-time data acquired during the life of the structure, accounting for “real” environmental conditions during predictions, and, eventually, moving beyond the “factors of safety” era...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{digitalization}} {{of manufacturing}} fuels {{the application of}} sophisticated virtual product models, which {{are referred to as}} digital twins, throughout all stages of product realization. Particularly, more realistic virtual models of manufactured products are essential {{to bridge the gap between}} design and manufacturing and to mirror the real and virtual worlds. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive reference model based on the concept of Skin Model Shapes, which serves as a <b>digital</b> <b>twin</b> of the physical product in design and manufacturing. In this regard, model conceptualization, representation, and implementation as well as applications along the product life-cycle are addressed. In today's highly competitive markets, the ambitions for shortening the time to market and for increasing the product development performance fuel the application of sophisticated virtual product models, which are frequently referred to as digital twins. Enabled by the digitalization of manufacturing, cyber-physical production systems, model-based system engineering, and a growing endeavour for data gathering and processing, these models are increasingly enriched with production and operation data. Moreover, they allow the efficient prediction of the effects of product and process development as well as operating and servicing decisions on the product behaviour without the need for costly and time-expensive physical mock-ups [1 - 3]. Particularly in design, such realistic product models are essential to allow the early and efficient assessment of the consequences of design decisions on the quality and function of mechanical products. However, current approaches to the implementation of digital twins lack of a conceptual basis, which hinders the applicability of the <b>digital</b> <b>twin</b> vision to various activities in design and production engineering. Motivated by this need, this paper proposes a comprehensive reference model, which serves as a <b>digital</b> <b>twin</b> of the physical product in design and production engineering. In this regard, important model properties, such as scalability, interoperability, expansibility, and fidelity, as well as different operations on this reference model along the product life-cycle, such as composition, decomposition, conversion, and evaluation are addressed. Moreover, the application of this reference model to geometrical variations management is highlighted. The paper is structured as follows. In the next section, the vision of the <b>digital</b> <b>twin</b> and its evolution is reviewed. After that, a comprehensive reference model for the <b>digital</b> <b>twin</b> is introduced, which is then applied to geometrical variations management.

40|$|Faster {{optimization}} algorithms, increased computer {{power and}} amount of available data, can leverage the area of simulation towards real-time control and optimization of products and production systems. This concept — {{often referred to as}} <b>Digital</b> <b>Twin</b> — enables real-time geometry assurance and allows moving from mass production to more individualized production. To master the challenges of a <b>Digital</b> <b>Twin</b> for Geometry Assurance the project Smart Assembly 4. 0 gathers Swedish researchers within product development, automation, virtual manufacturing, control theory, data analysis and machine learning. The vision of Smart Assembly 4. 0 is the autonomous, self-optimizing robotized assembly factory, which maximizes quality and throughput, while keeping flexibility and reducing cost, by a sensing, thinking and acting strategy. The concept is based on active part matching and self-adjusting equipment which improves geometric quality without tightening the tolerances of incoming parts. The goal is to assemble products with higher quality than the incoming parts. The concept utilizes information about individual parts to be joined (sensing), selects the best combination of parts (thinking) and adjust locator positions, clamps, weld/rivet positions and sequences (acting). The project is ongoing, and this paper specifies and highlights the infrastructure, components and data flows necessary in the <b>Digital</b> <b>Twin</b> in order to realize Smart Assembly 4. 0.

30|$|Moreover, <b>digital</b> <b>twins</b> or <b>digital</b> shadows {{are often}} used in a very static way for service {{brokerage}} or for simulations. In fact, {{it is necessary to}} use them in the sense of models at runtime, however. This means {{that it is necessary to}} use models at runtime to enable constituent systems, as well as the open adaptive system of systems, to reflect their current status and the status of its context. In other words, it is necessary to create a kind of self-awareness, which is in turn the basis for reasoning about and assuring relevant system properties and qualities at runtime. Again, this monitoring and assurance process must be enabled at different levels. At the constituent system’s level, for example, the models monitor the status of a single car and ensure its quality within the given runtime context. At the system of systems’ level, for example, models reflect all cars participating in an autonomous platoon, including the platooning process, in order to monitor and assure the quality of the platoon as a whole. Potentially, it is also reasonable to have models at a global level, for example, to reflect information gathered from as many autonomous cars around the world as possible in order to improve functionality and quality in the long run based on field data systematically fed back into the models.|$|R

40|$|The elusive {{quest for}} {{intelligence}} in artificial intelligence prompts {{us to consider}} that instituting human-level intelligence in systems may be (still) {{in the realm of}} utopia. In about a quarter century, we have witnessed the winter of AI (1990) being transformed and transported to the zenith of tabloid fodder about AI (2015). The discussion at hand is about the elements that constitute the canonical idea of intelligence. The delivery of intelligence as a pay-per-use-service, popping out of an app or from a shrink-wrapped software defined point solution, is in contrast to the bio-inspired view of intelligence as an outcome, perhaps formed from a tapestry of events, cross-pollinated by instances, each with its own microcosm of experiences and learning, which may not be discrete all-or-none functions but continuous, over space and time.
