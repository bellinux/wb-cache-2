25|$|In {{computer}} sciences, {{and more}} particularly in artificial intelligence these mean <b>field</b> <b>type</b> genetic algorithms {{are used as}} random search heuristics that mimic {{the process of evolution}} to generate useful solutions to complex optimization problems. These stochastic search algorithms belongs to the class of Evolutionary models. The idea is to propagate a population of feasible candidate solutions using mutation and selection mechanisms. The mean field interaction between the individuals is encapsulated in the selection and the cross-over mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} more {{sophisticated}} mean <b>field</b> <b>type</b> particle Monte Carlo methods had certainly {{started by the}} mid-1960s, {{with the work of}} Henry P. McKean Jr. on Markov interpretations of a class of nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations arising in fluid mechanics. We also quote an earlier pioneering article by Theodore E. Harris and Herman Kahn, published in 1951, using mean field genetic-type Monte Carlo methods for estimating particle transmission energies. Mean field genetic type Monte Carlo methodologies are also used as heuristic natural search algorithms (a.k.a. Metaheuristic) in evolutionary computing. The origins of these mean field computational techniques can be traced to 1950 and 1954 with the work of Alan Turing on genetic type mutation-selection learning machines and the articles by Nils Aall Barricelli at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.|$|E

2500|$|The new {{howitzer}} was a road-mobile weapon {{mounted on}} a two-wheeled <b>field</b> <b>type</b> carriage of conventional, if massive, construction. It was a completely different weapon from the Gamma-Gerät. The barrel was shorter than Gamma's by four calibres length, and reverted to the conventional Krupp sliding-wedge breech. With thinner walls, the barrel was of generally lighter construction than Gamma's and fired lighter shells of around 830kg. Fully assembled it weighed 43 tons, much less than Gamma, {{and did not have}} to be emplaced in concrete. Special steel [...] "mats" [...] were developed, onto which the wheels were driven, with a steel aiming arc at the rear of the carriage that allowed limited traverse. This aiming arc was fitted with a massive [...] "spade" [...] that was buried in the ground and which helped anchor the weapon. To prevent the weapon bogging down in muddy roads the guns were equipped with Radgürteln, feet attached to the rim of the wheels to reduce ground pressure. Krupp and Daimler developed a tractor for the Bertha, though Podeus motorploughs were also used to tow the guns, which were broken down into five loads when on the road.|$|E
