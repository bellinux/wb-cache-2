25|$|An {{advantage}} of parabolic antennas {{is that most}} of the structure of the antenna (all of it except the feed antenna) is nonresonant, so it can function over a wide range of frequencies, that is a wide bandwidth. All that is necessary to change the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> is to replace the feed antenna with one that works at the new frequency. Some parabolic antennas transmit or receive at multiple frequencies by having several feed antennas mounted at the focal point, close together.|$|E
500|$|The {{technology}} used for constructing filters is chosen {{to a large}} extent by the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> that is expected, although there is a large amount of overlap. [...] Low frequency applications such as audio electronics use filters composed of discrete capacitors and inductors. [...] Somewhere in the very high frequency band, designers switch to using components made of pieces of transmission line. [...] These kinds of designs are called distributed element filters. [...] Filters made from discrete components are sometimes called lumped element filters to distinguish them. [...] At still higher frequencies, the microwave bands, the design switches to waveguide filters, or sometimes a combination of waveguides and transmission lines.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rated voltage}} of {{different}} film materials depends on {{factors such as}} the thickness of the film, the quality of the material (freedom from physical defects and chemical impurities), the ambient temperature, and <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> plus a safety margin against the breakdown voltage (dielectric strength). But to a first approximation, the voltage rating of a film capacitor depends primarily on the thickness of the plastic film. For example, with the minimum available film thickness of polyester film capacitors (about 0.7Âµm), it is possible to produce capacitors with a rated voltage of 400VDC. If higher voltages are needed, typically a thicker plastic film will be used. [...] But the breakdown voltage for dielectric films is usually nonlinear. For thicknesses greater than about 5 mils, the breakdown voltage only increases approximately with the square-root of the film thickness. On the other hand, the capacitance decreases linearly with increased film thickness. [...] For reasons of availability, storage and existing processing capabilities, it is desirable to achieve higher breakdown voltages while using existing available film materials. This can be achieved by a one-sided partial metallization of the insulating films in such a manner that an internal series connection of capacitors is produced. By using this series connection technique, the total breakdown voltage of the capacitor can be multiplied by an arbitrary factor, but the total capacitance is also reduced by the same factor.|$|E
