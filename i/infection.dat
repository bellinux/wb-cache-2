5|$|A {{urinary tract}} <b>infection</b> (UTI) is an <b>infection</b> that affects {{part of the}} urinary tract. When it affects the lower urinary tract it {{is known as a}} bladder <b>infection</b> (cystitis) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as kidney <b>infection</b> (pyelonephritis). Symptoms from a lower urinary tract include pain with urination, {{frequent}} urination, and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder. Symptoms of a kidney <b>infection</b> include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In the very old and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific.|$|E
5|$|About 150 {{million people}} {{developed}} a urinary tract <b>infection</b> each year. They {{are more common}} in women than men. In women, {{they are the most}} common form of bacterial <b>infection.</b> Up to 10% of women have a urinary tract <b>infection</b> in a given year and half of women having at least one <b>infection</b> at some point in their lives. They occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35years. Recurrences are common. Urinary tract infections have been described since ancient times with the first documented description in the Ebers Papyrus dated to c. 1550 BC.|$|E
5|$|Children {{are less}} likely than adults to clear the <b>infection.</b> More than 95% of people who become {{infected}} as adults or older children will stage a full recovery and develop protective immunity to the virus. However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the <b>infection</b> from their mother at birth will clear the <b>infection.</b> This population has a 40% lifetime risk of death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Of those infected between the age of one to six, 70% will clear the <b>infection.</b>|$|E

5|$|Croup {{is usually}} {{deemed to be}} due to a viral <b>infection.</b> Others use the term more broadly, to include acute laryngotracheitis, spasmodic croup, {{laryngeal}} diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. The first two conditions involve a viral <b>infection</b> and are generally milder with respect to symptomatology; the last four are due to bacterial <b>infection</b> and are usually of greater severity.|$|E
5|$|During HBV <b>infection,</b> {{the host}} immune {{response}} causes both hepatocellular damage and viral clearance. Although the innate immune response does {{not play a}} significant role in these processes, the adaptive immune response, in particular virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTLs), contributes to most of the liver injury associated with HBV <b>infection.</b> CTLs eliminate HBV <b>infection</b> by killing infected cells and producing antiviral cytokines, which are then used to purge HBV from viable hepatocytes. Although liver damage is initiated and mediated by the CTLs, antigen-nonspecific inflammatory cells can worsen CTL-induced immunopathology, and platelets activated at the site of <b>infection</b> may facilitate the accumulation of CTLs in the liver.|$|E
5|$|Factors that {{increase}} the risk of polio <b>infection</b> or affect the severity of the disease include immune deficiency, malnutrition, physical activity immediately following the onset of paralysis, skeletal muscle injury due to injection of vaccines or therapeutic agents, and pregnancy. Although the virus can cross the maternal-fetal barrier during pregnancy, the fetus {{does not appear to be}} affected by either maternal <b>infection</b> or polio vaccination. Maternal antibodies also cross the placenta, providing passive immunity that protects the infant from polio <b>infection</b> during the first few months of life.|$|E

5|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus <b>infection</b> and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is {{a spectrum of}} conditions caused by <b>infection</b> with the human {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV). Following initial <b>infection,</b> a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience {{a brief period of}} influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the <b>infection</b> progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of <b>infection</b> are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This stage is often also associated with weight loss.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011, Mandela {{was briefly}} hospitalised with a {{respiratory}} <b>infection,</b> attracting international attention, before being re-admitted for a lung <b>infection</b> and gallstone removal in December 2012. After a successful medical procedure in early March 2013, his lung <b>infection</b> recurred {{and he was}} briefly hospitalised in Pretoria. In June 2013, his lung <b>infection</b> worsened and he was readmitted to a Pretoria hospital in serious condition. The Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba visited Mandela {{at the hospital and}} prayed with Machel, while Zuma cancelled a trip to Mozambique to visit him the following day. In September 2013, Mandela was discharged from hospital, although his condition remained unstable.|$|E

5|$|<b>Infection,</b> {{bacterial}} or viral, {{particularly from}} Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococcus and Pseudomonas spp. Reports at the 16th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in 2006 indicated that bacterial infections are seldom serious, but that ten to {{twenty percent of}} piercings result in local benign bacterial <b>infection.</b> The Mayo Clinic estimates 30%. Risk of <b>infection</b> is greatest among those with congenital heart disease, who have a much higher chance of developing life-threatening infective endocarditis, hemophiliacs and diabetics, {{as well as those}} taking corticosteroids. In 2006, a diabetic woman in Indiana lost a breast due to an <b>infection</b> from a nipple piercing. Viral infections may include hepatitis B, hepatitis C and, potentially, HIV, although as of 2009 there had been no documented cases of HIV caused by piercing. While rare, <b>infection</b> due to piercing of the tongue can be fatal. Higher prevalence of colonization of Candida albicans was reported in young individuals with tongue piercing, in comparison to non-tongue-pierced matched individuals.|$|E

50|$|Our {{respiratory}} system is very prone to developing <b>infections</b> in the lungs.

5|$|Progression from TB <b>infection</b> to overt TB disease {{occurs when}} the bacilli {{overcome}} the immune system defenses and begin to multiply.

30|$|Multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative <b>infections</b> are {{frequently}} encountered in clinical practice [1].

Gram-negative organisms have been implicated in 10 – 20  % of implant-associated orthopaedic <b>infections</b> [5, 6].
