25|$|Dialogue journal {{writing has}} become an {{important}} component of professional development for teachers in both pre-service teacher training programs at universities and in in-service workshops and coaching. It might take place between the professor and a class of prospective teachers in a teacher preparation program; between prospective or new teachers and <b>experienced</b> <b>teachers</b> they are working with, as a mentoring and coaching opportunity; or between prospective and practicing teachers. Those who use and study these approaches have found that these professional conversations promote reflection on oneself as a teacher and between teachers as they reflect on their practice. Some research focuses on the types of responses and interactions that are effective for promoting teacher learning. With use of the Internet, these interactions can take place among educators around the world.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, all {{academic}} staff were poorly paid {{and there were}} no incentives for good work or penalties for poor practice. At AAU, {{academic staff}} could increase their income with additional work outside the university. This was not stopped because it would result in loss of <b>experienced</b> <b>teachers.</b> There was resentment that Indian professors were paid {{more than twice as much}} as Ethiopian professors. MU had the potential for improvement but, given low pay and possible opportunities for work in new private colleges, they could soon resemble AAU. JU, being in a remote area, had no opportunities for outside work, so staff were fully engaged with their work but they would leave if given the opportunity. Staff thought teaching was not up-to-date or based on practice because research was not being done. Staff were relying on foreign teaching materials and textbooks which might not relate to the Ethiopian situation. Class sizes and resource shortages meant that laboratory work, practical work, field work, essays and projects were gradually being phased out. Courses were reduced to theory without practice thus encouraging rote learning to pass exams.|$|E

3000|$|Search {{probability}} [...] (γ _j,k^o^k) uniformly shifts toward bad schools. This {{is especially}} pronounced for low <b>experience</b> <b>teachers</b> from good schools, who shift search by 10 percentage points. From the school-side, {{a reduction in}} the number of vacancies from good schools means lower competition for highly desirable teachers for good schools that are still in the market. As such, their strategy of search shifts to searching more heavily for mid and high <b>experience</b> <b>teachers</b> from good schools. Low <b>experience</b> <b>teachers</b> from good schools who are in the search market respond to this by shifting search to the bad school market, where they are most likely to find a match.|$|R

500|$|In the 19th century, {{religious}} denominations made a {{major contribution}} to education at all levels before this {{was taken over by}} the state. From its beginnings, St James' was involved in education for both children and adults. Richard Hill, the first minister, [...] "began Australia's first kindergarten and William Cape managed a school based on new educational principles". Hill worked with the Benevolent Society, the Bible Society, Aboriginals, the Hospital, [...] "various convict establishments and a range of schools," [...] including Industrial Schools. By 1823 Greenway's school building had been erected in Elizabeth Street and the principal St James' School was situated there until 1882, becoming the Anglican [...] "normal" [...] school with more than 600 students and a range of <b>experienced</b> <b>teachers.</b> In secondary education, a Sydney branch of the King's School operated briefly in the Greenway building and Bishop Broughton operated the St James' Grammar School in a building erected in Phillip Street. The Grammar School, presided over by the Revd C. Kemp was described as [...] "of inestimable value to the then youth of the colony". Bishop Broughton also set up St James' College to provide tertiary education for secular students as well as to prepare students for ordination. The St James' School closed in 1882 and the government resumed the Greenway building. Tuition for the students of St Paul's College, University of Sydney was originally provided in the vestry of St James'.|$|E
30|$|Table 4 {{shows the}} utility {{parameters}} of teachers matching {{with a particular}} school type and of schools matching with a particular teacher type. The top-third of Table 4 contains parameters for teacher utility. The parameter on low experience for matching with a bad school type is 0.3224. That is, compared to the base case of a <b>teacher</b> with high <b>experience</b> originating from a good school, a low <b>experience</b> <b>teacher</b> is happier matching with a bad school. The negative parameter on mid experience {{can be interpreted as}} the significant disutility felt by a mid <b>experience</b> <b>teacher</b> when matching with a bad school, compared to a highly <b>experienced</b> <b>teacher.</b> This {{may be due to the}} fact that a mid-career teacher regards a transfer as a chance to move into a more desirable school, while a highly <b>experienced</b> <b>teacher</b> moving may be driven by life-style concerns unrelated to school quality. The parameter on originating from a bad school is 1.4381. That is, a teacher from a bad school will be significantly happier to match with a bad school compared to a teacher from a good school.|$|R

30|$|This large {{increase}} in search {{in the bad}} school market predictably leads to lower match probabilities for low and mid <b>experience</b> <b>teachers</b> in these markets.

60|$|This book is {{intended}} to detail, in a familiar and practical manner, a system of arrangements for the organization and management of a school, based on the employment, so far as is practicable, of Moral Influences, {{as a means of}} effecting the objects in view. Its design is, not to bring forward new theories or new plans, but to develope and explain, and to carry out to their practical applications, such principles as, among all skilful and <b>experienced</b> <b>teachers,</b> are generally admitted and acted upon. Of course it is not designed for the skilful and the experienced themselves; but it {{is intended}} to embody what they already know, and to present it in a practical form, for the use of those who are beginning the work and who wish to avail themselves of the experience which others have acquired.|$|E
60|$|From {{the very}} nature of our employment, and of the {{circumstances}} under which the preparation for it must be made, it is plain that, of the many thousands who are, in the United States, annually entering the work, a very large majority must depend for all their knowledge of the art except what they acquire from their own observation and experience, on what they can obtain from books. It is desirable that the class of works from which such knowledge can be obtained should be increased. Some excellent and highly useful specimens have already appeared, and very many more would be eagerly read by teachers, if properly prepared. It is essential however that they should be written by <b>experienced</b> <b>teachers,</b> who have for some years been actively engaged, and specially interested in the work;--that they should be written in a very practical and familiar style,--and that they should exhibit principles which are unquestionably true, and generally admitted by good teachers, and not the new theories peculiar to the writer himself. In a word, utility, and practical effect, should be the only aim.|$|E
6000|$|Those {{who knew}} him will {{recognize}} in my third act the allusion to the patent Shorthand in which he used to write postcards, and which may be acquired from a four and six-penny manual published by the Clarendon Press. The postcards which Mrs. Higgins describes are such as I have received from Sweet. I would decipher a sound which a cockney would represent by zerr, and a Frenchman by seu, and then write demanding with some heat what on earth it meant. Sweet, with boundless contempt for my stupidity, would reply that it not only meant but obviously was the word Result, as no other Word containing that sound, and capable of making sense with the context, existed in any language spoken on earth. That less expert mortals should require fuller indications was beyond Sweet's patience. Therefore, though {{the whole point of}} his [...] "Current Shorthand" [...] is that it can express every sound in the language perfectly, vowels as well as consonants, and that your hand has to make no stroke except the easy and current ones with which you write m, n, and u, l, p, and q, scribbling them at whatever angle comes easiest to you, his unfortunate determination to make this remarkable and quite legible script serve also as a Shorthand reduced it in his own practice to the most inscrutable of cryptograms. His true objective was the provision of a full, accurate, legible script for our noble but ill-dressed language; but he was led past that by his contempt for the popular Pitman system of Shorthand, which he called the Pitfall system. The triumph of Pitman was a triumph of business organization: there was a weekly paper to persuade you to learn Pitman: there were cheap textbooks and exercise books and transcripts of speeches for you to copy, and schools where <b>experienced</b> <b>teachers</b> coached you up to the necessary proficiency. Sweet could not organize his market in that fashion. He {{might as well have been}} the Sybil who tore up the leaves of prophecy that nobody would attend to. The four and six-penny manual, mostly in his lithographed handwriting, that was never vulgarly advertized, may perhaps some day be taken up by a syndicate and pushed upon the public as The Times pushed the Encyclopaedia Britannica; but until then it will certainly not prevail against Pitman. I have bought three copies of it during my lifetime; and I am informed by the publishers that its cloistered existence is still a steady and healthy one. I actually learned the system two several times; and yet the shorthand in which I am writing these lines is Pitman's. And the reason is, that my secretary cannot transcribe Sweet, having been perforce taught in the schools of Pitman. Therefore, Sweet railed at Pitman as vainly as Thersites railed at Ajax: his raillery, however it may have eased his soul, gave no popular vogue to Current Shorthand. Pygmalion Higgins is not a portrait of Sweet, to whom the adventure of Eliza Doolittle would have been impossible; still, as will be seen, there are touches of Sweet in the play. With Higgins's physique and temperament Sweet might have set the Thames on fire. As it was, he impressed himself professionally on Europe to an extent that made his comparative personal obscurity, and the failure of Oxford to do justice to his eminence, a puzzle to foreign specialists in his subject. I do not blame Oxford, because I think Oxford is quite right in demanding a certain social amenity from its nurslings (heaven knows it is not exorbitant in its requirements!); for although I well know how hard it is for a man of genius with a seriously underrated subject to maintain serene and kindly relations with the men who underrate it, and who keep all the best places for less important subjects which they profess without originality and sometimes without much capacity for them, still, if he overwhelms them with wrath and disdain, he cannot expect them to heap honors on him.|$|E
