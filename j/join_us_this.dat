2500|$|With {{the backing}} of AMC, a fourth series of Hustle was {{virtually}} guaranteed, and by late 2006 {{it was clear that}} the cable network was taking a commanding role in the show's development. Despite the increased funding AMC provided, which allowed the writers to set episodes in Las Vegas and Los Angeles, the series was quickly mired in casting concerns. It was first rumoured in April 2006 that Adrian Lester might not return as Mickey Bricks in the fourth series; the BBC confirmed his departure in September that year, elevating Marc Warren's character to the lead role and casting Ashley Walters as a new member of the group. The BBC was quick to dispel any suggestion that Lester's resignation was connected to the shift in production focus, stating [...] "it is a shame that, due to his current filming commitments, Adrian cannot <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>this</b> time round...", while Lester explained his action as [...] "need to do something else, be associated with something else". However, Lester also admitted that he felt that the series [...] "just got a little bit too 'light'".|$|E
2500|$|Su Ze {{called for}} a meeting with Hao Zhao, Wei Ping, his {{subordinates}} and his Qiang allies to discuss {{how to deal with the}} rebellions. He told them: [...] "Although the rebels have superiority in numbers, they are nothing more than a motley crowd. As some of them have been forced to join the rebellion, they aren't necessarily as united as they seem. We should exploit their differences and make them split into 'good' and 'bad' camps. We shall then induce those in the 'good' camp to <b>join</b> <b>us.</b> <b>This</b> will boost our numbers and reduce theirs. Once we have increased our numbers, our morale will increase as well. By then, we should be able to defeat the rebels easily. If we do nothing now and wait for reinforcements to arrive, by then it'll be much more difficult to separate the rebels into 'good' and 'bad' camps and turn those in the 'good' camp to our side. Although we have no authorisation from the imperial court, given the current circumstances, I don't think it's unreasonable for us to exercise our own judgment and act accordingly." ...|$|E

An inspired English Cabinet Minister, travel-stained and dusty, arrives with his valet and a black dispatch-box, to foil our schemes. Send him along, my friend. We {{are not at all}} afraid of Mr. Simpson. Perhaps we may even ask him to <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>this</b> evening." ...|$|E

As yet it is {{possible}} to get on without more help, but I do not for a moment doubt that should God really grant not only a wide field of labour, but some such hope of cultivating it, He will send forth plenty of men to share in this work. Men who have some means of their own--£100 a year is enough, or even less--or some aptitude for languages, surely will feel drawn in this direction. It is the happiest life a man can lead, full of enjoyment, physical and mental, exquisite scenery, famous warm climate, lots of bathing, yams and taro and cocoa-nut enough to make an alderman's mouth water, and such loving, gentle people. But of course something depends on the way in which a man looks at these things, and a fine gentleman who can't get on without his servant, and can't put his luggage for four months into a compass of six feet by one-and-a-half, won't like it....|$|E
