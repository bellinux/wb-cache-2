40|$|The Netherlands {{has a long}} {{tradition}} of flood risk management, due to its special physical location in the delta of four major river systems. This low-lying country is historically characterised by a ‘fight against water’. The <b>Flood</b> Risk Governance <b>Arrangement</b> of the Netherlands is characterised by a strong focus on reducing flood probability and governmental responsibility. A key characteristic is the statutory right to flood protection from the state. The arrangement of actors, rules, resources and discourses is focused on probability-reduction by administrative organisations. Nevertheless, in recent years a number of changes towards a broader number of Flood Risk Management Strategies (FRMSs) can be observed and different modes of governance are starting to emerge. This report provides insights into the ways in which flood risk governance is changing in the Netherlands, as well as into {{the extent to which the}} system enables or constrains societal resilience to flooding. This report is a deliverable of the EU 7 th Framework Project STAR-FLOOD (www. starflood. eu). STAR-FLOOD focuses on Flood Risk Governance. The project investigates strategies for dealing with flood risks in 18 vulnerable urban regions in six European countries: England in the UK, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden.

40|$|Similar {{to several}} other {{countries}} in Europe, a policy debate has emerged in Flanders (Belgium) arguing that flood risks should no longer be tackled by water managers alone but should become a shared responsibility between water managers, other governmental actors and citizens. Hence, a form of ‘co-production’ is advocated, whereby both governmental and non-governmental actors participate in bringing flood risk management into practice. This new approach represents a remarkable break with the past, since flood management in Flanders is traditionally based on flood probability reduction through engineering practices. The intended shift in private-public responsibilities can thus be expected to challenge the existing <b>flood</b> policy <b>arrangement.</b> Based on quantitative and qualitative research, this paper compares the attitudes towards individual responsibilities in flood protection among public officials and residents of flood-affected areas in the flood-prone basin of the river Dender. We find that whereas most public officials are in favour of sharing flood risk responsibilities between authorities and citizens, the majority of residents consider flood protection as an almost exclusive government responsibility. We discuss the challenges this discourse gap presents for {{the pursuit of a}} co-produced flood risk management and how these can be addressed.

40|$|About 95 - 97 % of all {{deaths and}} a {{significant}} part of the economic losses caused by floods occur in developing countries. Despite the resources spent on different measures, <b>flood</b> management <b>arrangements</b> in developing countries are still unable to deliver satisfactory results. The objective of this thesis is ‘to maximize land-use benefits and minimize flood damage with available resources in a floodplain’. A risk-based flood management framework is proposed, which provides the logical grounds for the selection and (optimal) design of the structural and non-structural measures. In the framework of this research, risk is the result of the combination of ‘hazard’ and ‘vulnerability’. The Expected Annual Damage (EAD) is an important part of the basis of the risk analysis. Flood damage curves and EAD distribution maps provide detailed risk information. The concept of the Optimal Risk Point (ORP) is introduced to achieve the objective of this research. ORP is the state of flood management in a floodplain where ‘flood deductions’ are at the minimum. Dikes, dredging, flood zoning, and flood insurance are evaluated through a risk-based assessment in the Pakistani setting. The ORP concept helps in developing risk-based safety standards for flood management. In addition, it is concluded that flood management must be an integral part of the land-use development. Flood risk management should follow the local context and must address socio-economic issues accordingly. The individual choice to accept risk may be covered by introducing complementary insurance or flood taxes. WatermanagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Floods are {{challenging}} {{the resilience of}} societies all over the world. In many countries there are discussions on diversifying the strategies for flood risk management, which implies some sort of policy change. To understand the possibilities of such change, {{a thorough understanding of}} the forces of stability and change of underlying governance arrangements is required. It follows from the path dependency literature that countries which rely strongly on flood infrastructures, as part of flood defense strategies, would be more path dependent. Consequently there is a higher chance to find more incremental change in these countries than in countries that have a more diversified set of strategies. However, comparative and detailed empirical studies that may help scrutinize this assumption are lacking. To address this knowledge gap, this paper investigates how six European countries (Belgium, England, France, The Netherlands, Poland and Sweden) essentially differ with regard to their governance of flood risks. To analyze stability and change, we focus on how countries are responding to certain societal and ecological driving forces (ecological turn; climate change discourses; European policies; and the increasing prevalence of economic rationalizations) that potentially affect the institutional <b>arrangements</b> for <b>flood</b> risk governance. Taking both the variety of flood risk governance in countries and their responses to driving forces into account, we can clarify the conditions of stability or change of <b>flood</b> risk governance <b>arrangements</b> more generally. The analysis shows that the national-level impact of driving forces is strongly influenced by the <b>flood</b> risk governance <b>arrangements</b> in the six countries. Path dependencies are indeed visible in countries with high investments in flood infrastructure accompanied by strongly institutionalized governance arrangements (Poland, the Netherlands) but not only there. Also more diversified countries that are less dependent on flood infrastructure and flood defense only (England) show path dependencies and mostly incremental change. More substantial changes are visible in countries that show moderate diversification of strategies (Belgium, France) or countries that ‘have no strong path yet’ in comprehensive flood risk governance (Sweden). This suggests that policy change can be expected when there is both the internal need and will to change and a barrage of (external) driving forces pushing for change...|$|R
40|$|Floods are {{the most}} {{frequent}} and damaging {{of all types of}} natural disasters and annually affect the lives of millions all over the globe. Against this background, enhanced climate variability and climate change are expected to increase the frequency and intensity of floods. The situation is further complicated by the Transboundary nature of water, making Transboundary cooperation on integrated flood risk management not only necessary, but highly beneficial as well. Unfortunately, numerous challenges hamper effective Transboundary cooperation in general and cooperation on Transboundary flood management in particular, thereby increasing vulnerability to floods. Flood Risk Management Strategies (FRMSs) are designed to make vulnerable urban regions more resilient to flooding. This likely requires changes in their institutional embedding. Insights into this institutional embedding of FRMSs so far is, however, rather limited and fragmented. In this paper we argue that such insights can be created by drawing upon and combining public administration and legal expertise. To make a start with the latter, we introduce the Transboundary <b>Flood</b> Risks Governance <b>Arrangements</b> (TFRGAs) approach. In the EU-funded STARFLOOD-project we will use this approach to carry out comparative research to further elaborate the approach...|$|R
40|$|Bridge scour, {{which is}} the removal of bed {{materials}} from near the bridge foundations, is observed {{to be the most}} predominant cause of bridge failures in the United States. Scour in cohesive soils is greatly different from scour in cohesionless soils owing to the differences in critical shear stresses, scour extents and the time taken to reach the maximum scour depth in the scour process. The present solutions available for the cohesionless soils cannot be applied to cohesive soils because of the above crucial reasons. Also, a compound channel model with main channel and <b>flood</b> plain <b>arrangement</b> represents more closely the field stream conditions rather than a simple rectangular prismatic model. In this study, a systematic investigation of the scour process due to flow contractions in a compound channel with cohesive soil bed is made by conducting a series of flume tests representing typical field conditions. The effect of the most crucial factors causing contraction scour namely flow velocity, depth of flow and the shape of the abutment is examined. Correction factors are developed for changes in flow geometries incorporating simulation results from the one dimensional flow simulation model HEC RAS. Most importantly, a methodology to predict the depth of the deepest scour hole and its location {{in the vicinity of the}} contraction structure is developed for compound channels through an extension of the presently available methodology to predict maximum scour depths in simple rectangular channels. A prediction method to identify the extent of the uniform scour depth is also developed. Finally, an investigation of precision of the proposed methodology has been carried out on the field data from a number of real life contraction scour cases. The results obtained from this study indicate that depth of flow and geometry of the contraction section significantly influence final scour depth in cohesive soils with deeper flows and harsh contractions resulting in increased scour depths. However, corrections for different contraction inlet skew angles and long contractions need to be further explored in future studies...|$|R
40|$|It has {{recently}} been recommended that a shift from traditional flood prevention to more adaptive strategies is made, focusing on the reduction in and recovery from flood impacts {{as a means to}} improve resilience to climate impacts. This shift has had implications for the public–private divide in adaptive flood risk governance. In an urban context, it means that private actors such as developers and residents come into play, necessitating governance arrangements which cross the public–private divide. The division of responsibilities for water safety between {{the public and private sectors}} affects the way legitimacy is gained for these arrangements and raises new legitimacy issues. The paper offers an analysis of public and private responsibilities in adaptive <b>flood</b> risk governance <b>arrangements,</b> as well as of the legitimacy of the arrangements in the light of the public–private divide. A comparative case study is presented for three urban regeneration projects in un-embanked areas in Hamburg, Germany, Helsinki, Finland, and Rotterdam, the Netherlands, where adaptive strategies have been applied. The results show that network arrangements with joint public– private responsibilities use direct forms of participation and deliberation, but that these do not necessarily lead to more legitimate arrangements in the eyes of stakeholders as is often suggested in the literature. Both network and more public hierarchical arrangements can be perceived as quite legitimate under certain conditions...|$|R
40|$|Greening flood {{protection}} (GFP) is increasingly {{recognized as an}} adaptive and flexible approach to water management that is well suited to addressing uncertain futures associated with climate change. In the last decade, GFP knowledge and policies have developed rapidly, but implementation has been less successful and has run into numerous barriers. In this paper, we address the challenge of realizing green {{flood protection}} goals by specifically considering knowledge in the decision-making of a Dutch flood protection project in Lake Markermeer. In this project, an ecological knowledge arrangement and a traditional <b>flood</b> protection knowledge <b>arrangement</b> are compared and their interactions analysed. The analysis provides insight into the specific difficulties of implementing GFP measures and identifies ways to realize GFP goals. The primary challenge is twofold: First, a self-reinforcing cycle of knowledge production and decision-making in the flood protection domain inhibits the introduction of innovative and multifunctional approaches such as GFP; second, the distribution of power is severely unbalanced in terms of ecological enhancement and flood protection, favouring the latter. Implementation of GFP requires structural change and the integration of ecological and flood protection knowledge and policy. Potentially rewarding routes towards this integration are the exploration of shared interests in GFP {{and the creation of}} mutual dependency between knowledge arrangements. The case study and the insights it provides show that GFP is far from mainstream practice and that implementation requires serious effort and courage to break with historical practices...|$|R
40|$|European countries, {{especially}} urban areas, face increasing flood risks due to urbanization, {{increase of}} exposure and damage potential, {{and the effects}} of climate change. In literature and in practice, it is argued that a diversification of Flood Risk Management Strategies (FRMSs) makes countries more flood resilient. The latter requires innovations in existing <b>Flood</b> Risk Governance <b>Arrangements,</b> development of new arrangements and the coordination of these arrangements, but it also requires these arrangements to be tailored to their physical and institutional context. Within the EU FP 7 project STAR-FLOOD (2012 - 2016), a comparative analysis and evaluation of flood risk governance in Belgium, England, France, The Netherlands, Poland and Sweden has been conducted. The project identified at least seven key issues that are relevant for all researched countries (and probably also beyond). These key issues deal with the topics of (i) diversifying Flood Risk Management Strategies (ii) establishing connectivity between actors, levels and sectors through what we coin “bridging mechanisms” (iii) achieving coproduction between public and private actors; (iv) improving fragmented and often non-enforceable rule systems; (v) optimising available resources for FRM; (vi) operationalising the notion of “diversification of FRM strategies” in a country-specific way; (vii) follow general design principles for improving FRM that are sufficiently tailored to local circumstances.

40|$|Across Europe, {{citizens}} are increasingly expected {{to participate in}} the implementation of flood risk management (FRM), by engaging in voluntary-based activities to enhance preparedness, implementing property-level measures, and so forth. Although citizen participation in FRM decision making is widely addressed in academic literature, citizens' involvement in the delivery of FRM measures is comparatively understudied. Drawing from public administration literature, we adopted the notion of "coproduction" as an analytical framework for studying the interaction between citizens and public authorities, from the decision-making process through to the implementation of FRM in practice. We considered to what extent coproduction is evident in selected European Union (EU) member states, drawing from research conducted within the EU project STAR-FLOOD (Strengthening and Redesigning European Flood Risk Practices towards Appropriate and Resilient <b>Flood</b> Risk Governance <b>Arrangements).</b> On the basis of a cross-country comparison between Flanders (Belgium), England (United Kingdom), France, the Netherlands, and Poland, we have highlighted the varied forms of coproduction and reflected on how these have been established within divergent settings. Coproduction is most prominent in discourse and practice in England and is emergent in France and Flanders. By contrast, FRM in the Netherlands and Poland remains almost exclusively reliant on governmental protection measures and thereby consultation-based forms of coproduction. Analysis revealed how these actions are motivated by different underlying rationales, which in turn shape the type of approaches and degree of institutionalization of coproduction. In the Netherlands, coproduction is primarily encouraged to increase societal resilience, whereas public authorities in the other countries also use it to improve cost-efficiency and redistribute responsibilities to its beneficiaries...|$|R

In line with previous research, our analysis revealed that shock events test the capacity to resist and bounce back and provide opportunities for adapting and learning. They "open up" institutional arrangements and make them more susceptible to change, increasing the opportunity for adaptation. In this way they can facilitate a shift toward different degrees of resilience, i. e., by adjusting the current strategic approach or by moving toward another strategic approach. The direction of change is influenced by the actors and the frames they introduce, and their ability to increase the resonance of the frame. The persistence of change seems to be influenced by the evolution of the initial management approach, the availability of resources, or the willingness to allocate resources...|$|R
40|$|Countries {{all over}} the world face {{increasing}} flood risks because of urbanization and the effects of climate change. In Europe, flooding is the most common of all natural disasters and accounts for the largest number of casualties and highest amount of economic damage. The current scientific debate on how urban agglomerations can be made more resilient to these flood risks includes a discussion on how a diversification, coordination, and alignment of flood risk management strategies (FRMSs), including flood risk prevention through proactive spatial planning, flood defense, flood risk mitigation, flood preparation, and flood recovery, can contribute to flood resilience. Although effective implementation of FRMSs can be considered a necessary precondition for resilience, efficient and legitimate flood risk governance can enhance this societal resilience to flooding. Governance and legal research has the potential to provide crucial insights into the debate on how to improve resilience. Yet the social sciences have only looked into this issue in a fragmented manner, often without a comparative scope. This special feature addresses this knowledge gap by focusing on the scope and workings of FRMSs, but also on cross-cutting topics such as uncertainties, distributional effects, solidarity, knowledge management, and citizen participation. The papers included in this feature are written by both policy analysts and legal scholars. The above-mentioned issues are thus approached via a multidisciplinary perspective. All papers convincingly show that one-size-fits-all solutions for appropriate and resilient <b>flood</b> risk governance <b>arrangements</b> do not exist.

40|$|Flood risk is {{a growing}} concern in Canada’s cities. Residents of these cities have {{differential}} risk according to their unique vulnerability and exposure to flood hazards. Factors related to societal structural forces, human agency, and place interact to produce vulnerability to hazards. Analysis of the factors that influence vulnerability will lead {{to a better understanding of}} how unequal vulnerability to hazards is produced among residents of a city. This dissertation investigates the factors that influence vulnerability to flood hazards in a Canadian coastal urban region, Metro Vancouver. It develops and applies a conceptual framework for looking across scales and across actors to identify and situate the factors that influence vulnerability. The study uses multiple research methods to investigate these factors, including statistical analysis of population data, focus groups with municipal practitioners, a practitioner survey, a residential survey, and informal interviews with residents. The investigation centres on what I refer to as indicators and determinants of vulnerability, and how they interact to produce vulnerability. Social vulnerability is identified as an important determinant of vulnerability, and indicators of social vulnerability are tested with an index of population data at the neighbourhood scale. A participatory process illustrates that the input of municipal flood managers can be used to make a quantitative assessment of social vulnerability more meaningful to those working in local policy and reveals findings about how practitioners view vulnerability in their community. Institutional arrangements such as development regulations and property insurance are found to be another key determinant that influences vulnerability. The availability of overland flood insurance, as an institutional arrangement were it to be introduced in Canada, would have implications for residential vulnerability and the current regime of public <b>flood</b> management. Institutional <b>arrangements</b> appear to interact with social vulnerability and other determinants to allow some groups of people to live in hazardous places without taking on the full associated risk. The findings of the study offer insights to what produces vulnerability and how, or whether, policy measures can address these factors to equitably reduce risk...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. European {{countries}} face increasing flood risks {{because of}} urbanization, increase of exposure and damage potential, {{and the effects}} of climate change. In literature and in practice, it is argued that a diversification of strategies for flood risk management (FRM), including flood risk prevention (through proactive spatial planning), flood defense, flood risk mitigation, flood preparation, and flood recovery, makes countries more flood resilient. Although this thesis is plausible, it should still be empirically scrutinized. We aim to do this. Drawing on existing literature we operationalize the notion of “flood resilience” into three capacities: capacity to resist; capacity to absorb and recover; and capacity to transform and adapt. Based on findings from the EU FP 7 project STAR-FLOOD, we explore the degree of diversification of FRM strategies and related <b>flood</b> risk governance <b>arrangements</b> at the national level in Belgium, England, France, the Netherlands, Poland, and Sweden, as well as these countries’ achievement in terms of the three capacities. We found that the Netherlands {{and to a lesser extent}} Belgium have a strong capacity to resist, France a strong capacity to absorb and recover, and especially England a high capacity to transform and adapt. Having a diverse portfolio of FRM strategies in place may be conducive to high achievements related to the capacities to absorb/recover and to transform and adapt. Hence, we conclude that diversification of FRM strategies contributes to resilience. However, the diversification thesis should be nuanced in the sense that there are different ways to be resilient. First, the three capacities imply different rationales and normative starting points for flood risk governance, the choice between which is inherently political. Second, we found trade-offs between the three capacities, e. g., being resistant seems to lower the possibility to be absorbent. Third, to explain countries’ achievements in terms of resilience, the strategies’ feasibility in specific physical circumstances and their fit in existing institutional contexts (appropriateness), as well as the establishment of links between strategies, through bridging mechanisms, have also been shown to be crucial factors. We provide much needed reflection on the implications of this diagnosis for governments, private parties, and citizens who want to increase flood resilience...|$|R

A comparison of the ratios of seedlings, saplings and adults in different riparian zones for the years, 2004, 2011 and 2013, was carried out. The results suggest that in general seeds are deposited randomly on the banks, where they germinate and become seedlings. Seedlings that become established at locations unsuitable for their persistence into adulthood are removed either by high flows or perish during dry conditions. Thus, lateral zonation eventually develops due to species differences in tolerance to conditions at different positions on the banks. The second objective was to explore the effects of the reduction in dry season low flows on the recruitment success of riparian species at sites upstream and downstream of abstraction points. At most sites plants were arranged into different lateral zones and the numbers of species between upstream and downstream sites were not significantly different. There were significant differences in the abundances between up- and downstream sites, with the loss of herbaceous plants and sedges at downstream sites, both of which favour moist conditions. Also, in the absence of dry season flows, the seedlings of dry bank tree species recruited closer to the channel than those at the sites with summer flows. The shifting of the dry bank into the channel narrows the channel, which may affect the hydraulic pressures exerted during <b>floods.</b> The spatial <b>arrangement</b> in the riparian zone has as much to do with flow conditions post recruitment as it does with conditions during recruitment. This shows that the structure of riparian plants is determined not only by whether or not the minimum flows are met, this points to the need to reinstate the naturally variable flow and adopting a holistic approach for the understanding and management of aquatic systems...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} make European regions more {{resilient}} to flood risks a broadening of Flood Risk Management strategies (FRMSs) might be necessary. The {{development and implementation of}} FRMSs like risk prevention, flood defence, mitigation, preparation and recovery is a matter of governance, a process of more or less institutionalized interaction between public and/or private entities ultimately aiming at the realization of collective goals. Such processes are institutionally embedded in <b>Flood</b> Risk Governance <b>Arrangements</b> (FRGAs), which can be defined as “the constellation resulting from a dynamic interplay between actors and actor coalitions involved in all policy domains relevant for Flood Risk Management – including water management, spatial planning and disaster management; their dominant discourses; formal and informal rules of the game; and the power and resource base of the actors involved”. This definition stresses that FRGAs have an actor dimension, a rule dimension, a power and resource dimension and a discursive dimension. By focussing on FRGAs we hope to get a better insight into the societal aspects of FRMSs and the way they are institutionally embedded in a broad sense. The concept allows us to combine insights from policy scientists as well as legal scholars and urges researchers to focus on FRMSs using combined perspectives. The aim of this report is twofold. First we want to explore the governance challenges a shift in FRMSs may pose to society and second we will identify questions for further research. The report is based on a first exploration of relevant scientific articles and reports. Governance challenges are found within each of the four dimensions of the FRGAs. We therefore discuss these dimensions in separate chapters. Major challenges in the actor dimension are the necessity to organise joint working between relevant actors in an effective way, to adequately involve stakeholders and to optimise the science-policy interface. In the rule dimension we have found that the major challenge concerns the translation of general Flood Risk Management principles into a set of more specific organisational, substantive and procedural provisions. Efficient and joint use of resources is the major challenge addressed under the power and resources dimension. The overarching discourse-related governance challenge is the realisation of a discursive shift. Overall, our exploration indicates that FRGAs tend to be highly fragmented. The overall challenge flood risk governance has to face is {{the development and implementation of}} inspiring bridging concepts which change agents may use to create synergies between key actors involved in flood risk governance. Concepts like Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) or climate proofing are examples of this. Empirical research is needed to further elaborate on this...|$|R
40|$|The Early Cretaceous, Barremian – Aptian Helvetiafjellet Formation {{is a well}} exposed paralic {{succession}} deposited at ramp-type {{shelf of}} the Borealic sea in the Svalbard region. The Ullaberget section in the Van Keulenfjorden area is an important reference section for the formation, due to excellent exposures and great variation in facies associations. The formation is in this locality subdivided in a lower, middle and upper portion. The lower boundary of the Helvetiafjellet Formation is a subaerial erosional unconformity, cut into the open-marine black shale of the Late-Jurassic – Early-Barremian Janusfjellet Subgroup. The erosional boundary {{is marked by a}} thin, discontinuous lag of fluvial channel conglomerate with extrabasinal clasts {{at the base of the}} Ullaberget Member. The Ullaberget Member is here suggested to be a tidally influenced delta introducing the Helvetiafjellet Formation, and not representing the top unit of the Rurikfjellet Formation in the Janusfjellet Subgroup, as previously published. The erosional unconformity represents a regional sequence boundary. The “Ullaberget delta” is a small delta, 11 - 18 m thick with an internal clinoform set, possibly formed as a bay-head delta during early sea level rise. The delta top facies is marked by a slight erosion which represents a bay or lacustrine ravinement surface which is succeeded by lacustrine or brackish-water mudstone, thin coal beds and thin crevasse or interdistributary bay sandstone units, overlain by thin fluvial channel sandstone beds. Crevasse and interdistributary bay sandstones have dinosaur foot imprints. The middle portion of the Helvetiafjellet Formation is up to 50 m thick and comprises the major part of the Helvetiafjellet Formation. The lower boundary is a transgressive ravinement surface capped by up to 12 m thick lentoid sandstone bodies with large sets of planar cross-stratification showing tidal influence. These bodies are interpreted as formed as tidal sand ridges of a local estuary. The ridges are overlain by heterolithic mudstone and thin sandstone bed facies association, interpreted to have formed in small tidal channels within an intertidal mudflat and in a lower coastal plain environment. Some shale beds are supposed to be of marine bay origin, thus representing intermittent events of marine <b>flooding.</b> The facies <b>arrangement</b> within the middle portion reveals a vertically stacked pattern of parasequences, balanced by a rather constant A/S ratio. The upper portion of the formation is characterized by a more complex retrogradational parasequence set. Its lower boundary is put at the first marine flooding surface below fully marine strata. The parasequences include lagoonal mudstone, marine embayment mudstone, tidal channel infill and marine sandstone beds. The marine sandstone beds, up to about 1 m thick, are characterized by large Diplocraterion burrows, probably formed during storm events, also being supported by hummocky stratification in some of the sandstone beds. The upper boundary of the Helvetiafjellet Formation is put at the onset of fully marine conditions without any further paralic facies interruptions. These facies associations characterize the Aptian – Albian Carolinefjellet Formation. As an analog to paralic sandstone reservoirs, The Helvetiafjellet Formation in the Ullaberget section gives an interesting insight into rapid lateral and vertical variability and complexity of sandstone body geometries in such a marginal marine environment...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{planning}} is increasingly being considered {{as an important}} mechanism in coping with flood risk due to climate change. One {{of the reasons for}} this is that engineering approaches are increasingly expensive and cannot provide complete certainty of protection against climate-related floods. The thesis examines whether and how spatial {{planning is}} used in urban areas to promote resilience to flood risk and climate change. In this study, planning is considered as the regulation of physical implementation as well as the process of policy-making that guides spatial development. This process mainly involves the interaction and collaboration between actors (both public and private). The notion of resilience is being used more and more in discussions of complex issues like the impact of climate-related flood risks on spatial development. The interpretations of resilience can vary significantly depending on the local context, the focus of spatial development and the interests of the actors involved in decision- making. The study proposes six characteristics of planning decision-making that can help to promote the resilience of cities. These comprise: (i) considering the current situation, (ii) examining trends and future threats, (iii) learning from previous experience, (iv) setting goals, (v) initiating actions, and (vi) involving the public. The importance of these characteristics over time for policy and practice is examined according to empirical evidence from detailed case study analysis. Six case studies are presented, four in Taiwan and two in the Netherlands. In all of the case studies, the issue of flood risk and spatial development is considered important by policy- makers, but the planning strategies used to tackle climate-related flood risks are often different, as are the experiences of <b>flooding</b> and governance <b>arrangements.</b> The information gathered is primarily based on interviews and the review of planning policies, government reports and research documents. Comparative analysis is a central focus of the study. The analysis has both a national and international perspective, comparing cases within Taiwan and between Taiwan and the Netherlands. The national comparison examines the way in which local planning governance is addressed in shaping decisions to deal with flood risks. This can vary among cases which share similar spatial development objectives and national institutional framework. The international comparison between Taiwan and the Netherlands examines the roles of planning to promote urban resilience in the context of flood risk and climate change. Three conclusions can be drawn. First, the interpretation of resilience is dependent on the views and interests of the actors involved. These change over time and can be seen in different episodes of policy-making. Second, the importance of the different assessment characteristics varies from one case to another. The interests of the leading actors, the interpretations of flood risks and the framework of local collaboration are all major factors that shape these differences. These factors are often associated with planning traditions and relatively stable in resistant to change. Third, when there is a collaborative framework for planning involving multiple actors, the result is a more comprehensive set of strategies in dealing with flood risk.

40|$|This {{report has}} been {{compiled}} {{as part of}} the STAR-FLOOD project, a European FP 7 project focused on flood risk governance. The project investigates strategies for dealing with flood risks in 18 vulnerable urban regions in six European countries: Belgium, The UK (more precisely: England and Scotland), France, The Netherlands, Poland and Sweden. The report highlights the main similarities and differences between the six STAR-FLOOD consortium countries, complemented with some interesting examples from other European countries. Amongst other things, the report discusses the Flood Risk Management Strategies and <b>Flood</b> Risk Governance <b>Arrangements</b> that are in place. The report intends to contribute to an extended problem analysis of flood risk governance in Europe. STAR-FLOOD researchers in each country wrote a text on the situation in their country (included in the annex). Based on this input, eight salient themes have been identified according to which the countries seem to differ: i) The countries’ baseline situation in terms of their actual flood experiences (chapter 2); ii) Designated competent authorities and the actual competences that actors have for implementing Flood Risk Management Strategies (chapter 3); iii) Resources for flood risk governance: the financing arrangements that are in place (chapter 4); iv) The degree and ways in which integration between water management and spatial planning is taking place (chapter 5); v) The extent to which stakeholder involvement takes place {{and the ways in which}} it is done (chapter 6); vi) The substantive and procedural norms and goals that are in place (chapter 7); vii) The way in which discourses on flood management have evolved in each of the consortium countries and how this relates to discourses on flood management more generally (chapter 8). viii) The Flood Risk Management Strategies that are actually in place (chapter 9); The findings suggest mutual influences (but not necessarily causal relations) between experiences with floods (item i), the institutional organisation of water governance (item ii-vii) and the types of Flood Risk Management Strategies actually applied (item viii). Notwithstanding the differences, similarities between The Netherlands, France, the UK and Belgium have been identified. All these countries went through some similar stages from a dominant civil engineering paradigm, via a shift towards ‘non-structural measures’ and a wish to accommodate water, towards an acknowledgement of the need to take consequences of climate change into account. In Sweden, on the contrary, the significance of floods has been relatively low until recently (but its importance is expected to increase due to the expected consequences of climate change). On the other extreme, Poland is known to be short on resources for dealing with flood risks. Together with the findings of the other three reports produced within Work Package 1 of STARFLOOD, this report will serve as input for the development of an assessment framework for flood risk governance (WP 2) and as a reference for the case study research (WP 3). The report provides interesting conclusions, assumptions and questions to be taken up. In particular, policymakers, practitioners and the STAR-FLOOD consortium can derive the following lessons from this report:  Every Flood Risk Management Strategy is not feasible everywhere. The report has identified differences in the appropriateness of flood risk management strategies in specific contexts;  Item i-vii above constitute an initial check list of potential factors explaining stability and dynamics in flood risk governance;  A detailed list of practical questions has been derived, which researchers studying flood risk governance in the six STAR-FLOOD consortium countries are invited to consider...|$|R
