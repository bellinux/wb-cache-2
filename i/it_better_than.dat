McVicar tested a new patent compass in July and wrote a testimonial letter on 13 June. Vice-Admiral Robert Otway had ordered him to test the compass belonging to Mr. Alexander, of Leith, and McVicar used it for some nine weeks, finding <b>it</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the other compasses on Apelles.

When Doniger calls Marek and asks him to pick his three best people to return to New Mexico, Marek chooses Stern {{to be part of the}} team. When the science behind the ability to transmit people to other universes is discussed, Stern probably understands <b>it</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> anyone else. Stern is also the only one who recognizes that it is dangerous and chooses not to go. However, by not going, Stern becomes a key part of the team by assuring their survival in his innovations to rebuild the water walls that provide buffer for the re-building team.

500|$|Jean and Reiss {{served as}} show runners {{until the end}} of the fourth season in 1993. Since the show had already {{established}} itself in the first two seasons, they were able to give it more depth during their tenure. Jean believes this is one of the reasons that many fans and critics regard season three and four as the best seasons of The Simpsons. Bill Oakley, another writer on The Simpsons, has commented that [...] "Mike and Al are responsible for the best thing that ever appeared on television, which was the third season of The Simpsons."

[...] Max stated that [...] "Inflikted" [...] {{was supposed to go}} towards Soulfly's sixth studio album Conquer, but he wanted to do the song with Igor. For legal reasons, they could not use Inflikted as the band name. According to Max, [...] "A lot of people had used it before, so he {{had to come up with}} something else."

500|$|The episode {{as a whole}} {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Rae Votta of Billboard wrote that it [...] "stumbles {{as much as it}} shines, with two plot lines-worth of structure that make sense, and two that fall completely flat". Rolling Stone Erica Futterman stated that [...] "while there were undeniably significant plot moments, the emotional depth was lacking", and Robert Canning of IGN said it was [...] "kind of boring" [...] and nothing happened to [...] "make <b>it</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> bland". AOLTV Crystal Bell found it frustrating, and said that the [...] "worst part" [...] was that it [...] "made me stop caring about these characters". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgenstern similarly described Gandolfini's performance as [...] "marvelous" [...] and [...] "grounded in genial humanity", and found Louis-Dreyfus to be [...] "equally endearing". Ty Burr of The Boston Globe wrote that Gandolfini gave [...] "a performance of immense tenderness and charm", [...] "as endearing as it is heartbreaking", and said of Louis-Dreyfus, [...] "Holofcener brings out a vulnerability you may have forgotten was in this actress."

[...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote [...] "While Season 13 doesn’t threaten to approach the high standards of the series’ strongest years, episodes like “Shut” help make <b>it</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> expected.

Scott Heisel of Alternative Press {{referred to it}} one of the best songs on Paramore, saying [...] "There's no question that this is still Paramore, only it's better.

[...] Maura Johnston from Popdust gave the song a 5 out of 5, declaring [...] "If there’s any justice in the world this’ll be a song of the summer, or at least of the late spring". Joseph R.

[...] Writing in The Guardians sister paper, The Observer, Maurice Richardson thought that [...] "our Casanovaesque cad-clubman secret agent is mellowing a bit now"; Richardson liked the format, saying that [...] "the short form suits him quite well" [...] although the downside is that [...] "if it checks the wilder fantasies it cuts short the love-affairs". Writing in The Spectator, Cyril Ray (under the pseudonym Christopher Pym) wrote that [...] "each episode of the Bond novels meant the adventure was less probable and more preposterous than the last, and now our hero seems to have lost, as well as any claims to plausibility, the know-how, the know-who, know-what and sheer zing that used to carry the unlikely plots along.
