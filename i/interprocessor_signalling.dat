40|$|This paper {{shows how}} {{adoption}} of the UNIX* STREAMS framework permits convenient design of the protocols that the communications subsystem must provide within the HM-Nucleus. The subsystem uses the available resources (shared memory, <b>interprocessor</b> <b>signalling,</b> fast network) to provide an efficient and orderly data-transfer facility among the component processors. It is efficient enough to accommodate the requirements of time-dependent applications (such as real-time processing of speech or image data), yet flexible enough to allow implementation of the high-level protocols needed to support various distributed applications. The treatment of the communications needs of the various subsystems of the HM-Nucleus as protocols, and the incorporation of mechanisms to support these needs into {{the framework of the}} communications subsystem, are novel aspects of the work. Another novel aspect is that the software is written in a modular systems programming language called Turing Plu...|$|E
