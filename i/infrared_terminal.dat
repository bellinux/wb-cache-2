50|$|The LMMs in {{the initial}} batch use laser beam riding with <b>infrared</b> <b>terminal</b> homing and a laser {{proximity}} sensor, although a semi-active laser version is under development for precision surface attack roles.|$|E
50|$|Both naval {{versions}} {{are believed to}} include a secondary <b>infrared</b> <b>terminal</b> seeker, similar to the newer US Standard missile system, probably to reduce the system's vulnerability to saturation. This also allows the missile to engage contacts over the radar horizon, such as warships or sea-skimming anti-ship missiles.|$|E
50|$|The Hughes/Raytheon {{design was}} {{largely based on}} the ACIMD missile, with a hybrid ramjet/solid rocket engine which offered high speeds. The missile would use an {{inertial}} guidance system with terminal guidance provided by active radar homing - a mode of flight that would later be employed in the AIM-120 AMRAAM. An <b>infrared</b> <b>terminal</b> homing seeker was also planned, which would allow the missile to engage without any emissions which would alert the target.|$|E

50|$|The AGM-154C uses an Imaging <b>Infrared</b> (IIR) <b>terminal</b> seeker with {{autonomous}} guidance. The AGM-154C {{carries the}} BROACH warhead. This two stage warhead {{is made up}} from a WDU-44 shaped augmenting warhead and a WDU-45 follow through bomb. The weapon is designed to attack hardened targets. It entered service with the US Navy in February 2005.|$|R
50|$|The Standard {{can also}} be used against ships, either at {{line-of-sight}} range using its semi-active homing mode, or over the horizon using inertial guidance and <b>terminal</b> <b>infrared</b> homing.|$|R
50|$|All {{versions}} of the missile would use inertial navigation aided by Global Positioning System (GPS). The Navy and one Air Force version were to use an imaging <b>infrared</b> homing <b>terminal</b> sensor to recognize the target and terminal homing, and would be fitted with a unitary warhead. A second version Army missile would be launched by two booster rockets and carry the Combined Effects Bomblet (CEB) submunition against land targets.|$|R
50|$|The Seekbat {{was based}} on the AGM-78 Standard ARM. It had a larger {{propulsion}} unit and used semi-active radar homing with an <b>infrared</b> seeker for <b>terminal</b> guidance of the missile. The operational ceiling was 80000 ft.|$|R
50|$|Except for new {{technologies}} in the guidance and seeker sections, {{which included a}} Global Positioning System receiver, a Walleye optical guidance system, and a newly developed Maverick missile datalink, all of the missile hardware came directly from the Harpoon missile. The SLAM is also equipped with a Tomahawk missile warhead for better destructive force. SLAM missile uses an inertial navigation system, which is supplemented by Global Positioning System (GPS) input, and it also uses <b>Infrared</b> homing <b>terminal</b> guidance.|$|R
50|$|The Northrop Grumman Brilliant Anti-Tank (BAT) is a United States {{submunition}} round dispensed from a missile. It {{is capable}} of independently identifying and attacking armored vehicles. The BAT uses acoustic sensors to identify its intended targets, and an <b>infrared</b> homing (IR) <b>terminal</b> seeker to image and aim at the attack target.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of the Sky Bow 1 (Tien Kung 1) missile system was started in 1981 by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (CSIST). Firing trials started in 1986, using a semi-active radar homing seeker. A passive <b>infrared</b> homing <b>terminal</b> seeker was also developed as a secondary seeker for the TK-1, this was successfully tested against a HAWK missile target but never put in the production missile. CSIST also developed a large multifunction, phased-array radar known as Chang Bai (long white) for use with the Tien Kung (Sky Bow) series surface-to-air missile systems with 120 degree coverage and a maximum range of 450 km. Two versions of the phased array radar exist, a towed trailer radar and fixed [...] "hardened" [...] radar sites.|$|R
50|$|China {{reportedly}} {{received a}} small number of the Russian Smerch 9K58 300 mm, 12-tube multiple launch rocket system and its ammunition in 1997. The Smerch 9K58 system is capable of firing a ‘smart’ submunition that has a dual-colour <b>infrared</b> sensors for <b>terminal</b> guidance, which enables the rocket to achieve accuracies previously difficult to achieve with unguided rockets of that range. The submunition is fitted with kinetic energy fragment warheads which are said to be able to penetrate 70mm of armour at an angle of 30° to the normal.|$|R
5000|$|The Arrow 1 was {{reportedly}} a two-stage solid propellant missile, {{with an overall}} length of 7.5 m, a body diameter of 1200 mm, and a launch weight of around 2000 kg. It was estimated that the second stage had a length of 2.5 m, {{and that it had}} inertial and command update mid-course guidance, with a <b>terminal</b> <b>infrared</b> focal plane array. The missile was described as being relatively high-speed and maneuverable, with thrust vectoring in the both stages. The range capability has been described as around 50 km. On the other hand, the Arrow 1 could be a single stage missile. Development of the [...] "big and cumbersome" [...] Arrow 1 then ceased and further research continued with the [...] "smaller, faster and more lethal" [...] Arrow 2.|$|R
5000|$|The Low-Cost Guided Imaging Rocket was {{a weapons}} system under {{development}} for the US Navy as part of ONR's Low-Cost Imaging Terminal Seeker FNC. It transitioned as the weapon used in the Medusa Joint Capability Technology Demonstration with South Korea. [...] The program provided a precision guided 2.75 inch (70 mm) rocket for use with existing Hydra 70 systems in service, as such it has many similarities with the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System program. The principal difference between the systems is that while APKWS uses terminal laser homing, requiring the target to be 'painted' until impact, LOGIR would guide to a position supplied by the launching aircraft, using imaging <b>infrared</b> in the <b>terminal</b> phase making it a true fire-and-forget weapon. Another advantage of LOGIR {{was that it was}} [...] "especially effective against swarm attacks by enemies like small boats, as there’s no need for ongoing guidance." ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are other}} {{variants}} under development. One has an upgraded motor to boost range at high altitudes {{to as much}} as 120-160 km; it is known as the RVV-AE-PD. The 'PD' stands for Povyshenoy Dalnosti, which in Russian means [...] "improved range". This variant has been test-fired and uses a solid-fuel ramjet engine. Its range puts it in the long-range class and is equivalent in range to the AIM-54 Phoenix. In another version of the R-77, a <b>terminal</b> <b>infrared</b> homing seeker is offered. This is in line with the Russian practice of attacking targets by firing pairs of missiles with different homing systems. This complicates end-game defensive actions for the target aircraft, as it needs to successfully defeat two homing systems. This method of attack may not always be available as IR seekers typically have less range and less resistance to poor weather than radar seekers, which may limit the successful use of mixed seeker attacks unless the IR missile is initially directed by radar or some other means.|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} for a sterically encumbered, strong-field tris(diisopropylphosphino) borate ligand, [PhBP i Pr 3] ([PhBP i Pr 3] = [PhB(CH 2 P i Pr 2) 3] -), {{is reported}} to probe aspects of its conformational and electronic characteristics within a host of complexes. To this end, the Tl(I) complex, [PhBP i Pr 3]Tl, was synthesized, characterized, and used to install the [PhBP i Pr 3] ligand onto complexes of Fe, Co, and Ru. The spectroscopic, electrochemical, magnetic, and structural features of these complexes are compared with similar examples. Trigonally coordinated "[PhBP i Pr 3]M" platforms (M = Fe, Co) support both pi-acidic (N 2) and pi-basic (NR 2 -) ligands at a fourth binding site. Methylation of monomeric [M 0 (N 2) -] species successfully derivatizes the beta-N atom of the N 2 ligand and affords the diazenido product [M II (N 2 Me) ]. Addition of RN 3 to M I (N 2) M I results in oxidative nitrene transfer to generate [PhBP i Pr 3]M≡NR with concomitant N 2 release. A tetrahedrally coordinated L 3 Fe-N x platform that accommodates both terminal nitride (L 3 Fe IV ≡N) and dinitrogen (L 3 Fe I -N 2 -Fe I L 3) functionalities is described. The diamagnetic L 3 Fe IV ≡N species featured has been characterized in solution under ambient conditions by multinuclear NMR (1 H, 31 P, and 15 N) and <b>infrared</b> spectroscopy. The <b>terminal</b> nitride complex oxidatively couples to generate the previously reported L 3 Fe I -N 2 -Fe I L 3 species. The [PhBP i Pr 3] ligand can support a single iron or cobalt center in a pseudo-tetrahedral environment in which dinitrogen is bound in the fourth coordination site. Zero-valent metal-dinitrogen complexes have the general formula, [[PhBP i Pr 3]M(mu-N 2) ] 2 [Mg 2 +], while bridging structures can also be obtained as neutral [M I]—N 2 —[M I] or as anionic [(M) 2 (N 2) ] - species. The nature of the structural distortions observed in both [M(mu-N 2) ] 2 [Mg 2 +] and [M n]—N 2 —[M n] complexes are described. Magnetic characterization of the neutral and mixed-valence dimeric complexes reveal the complexes remain ferromagnetically coupled over all temperatures investigated. The coordination chemistry of group VIII metals featuring the bis(8 -quinolinyl) amine (HBQA) ligand is presented. The electrochemical behavior of Fe, Ru, and Os complexes bearing the BQA ligand is reported and compared to related ligand platforms. Halide and phosphine ligand exchange reactions are examined from complexes of the type (BQA) MX(PR 3) 2 (M = Ru, Os). Carbonyl and dinitrogen complexes of Ru and Os are prepared from halide abstraction from divalent Ru and Os precursors. The spectroscopic and structural features of these complexes are compared with similar examples. ...|$|R
