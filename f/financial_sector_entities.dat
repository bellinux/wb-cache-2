40|$|The {{turmoil in}} the {{international}} financial markets of advanced economies, that started around mid- 2007, has exacerbated substantially since August 2008. The financial market crisis {{has led to the}} collapse of major financial institutions and is now beginning to impact the real economy in the advanced economies. As this crisis is unfolding, credit markets appear to be drying up in the developed world. With the substantive increase in financial globalisation, how much will these developments affect India and other Asian emerging market economies (EMEs) ? India, like most other emerging market economies, has so far, not been seriously affected by the recent financial turmoil in developed economies. In my remarks today, I will, first, briefly set out reasons for the relative resilience shown by the Indian economy to the ongoing international financial markets ’ crisis. This will be followed by some discussion of the impact till date on the Indian economy and the likely implications in the near future. I then outline our approach to the management of the exposures of the Indian <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> <b>entities</b> to the collapse of major financial institutions in the US. Orderly conditions have been maintained in the domestic financial markets, which is attributable to a range of instruments available with the monetary authority to manage a variety of situations. Finally, I would briefly set out my thinking on the extent of vulnerability of the Asian economies, in general, to the global financial market crisis...|$|E

Major changes {{took place in}} the functioning of banks in India only after liberalization, globalization and privatization (LPG). It had become mandatory to study about them and to make a comparative analysis of services of private sector banks (Pvt. SBs) and Public Sector Banks (PSBs). Intense competition due to new information technology adopted by banks and thereby declining processing costs, the erosion of product and geographic boundaries, and less restrictive governmental regulations have all played a big role on Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) in India to forcefully compete with private and foreign banks.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{challenge}} conventional wisdom suggesting that public <b>sector</b> <b>entities</b> should learn from the private sector, and to state some potential lessons for business based on case study research in leading edge public <b>sector</b> <b>entities.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The approach is longitudinal case study research using the interview method and a literature search on public sector management. Findings – Business organizations can learn valuable lessons from leading edge public <b>sector</b> <b>entities,</b> such as the need to employ technology to reinvent themselves or to support unconventional strategies rather than just support existing processes; to change proactively rather than wait for a crisis; to strive for strategic innovation rather than simply incremental improvements; and to develop a heightened sense of competition to fight inertia and groupthink.

Further research can include a larger sample, to explore the validity of the lessons stated here, and to derive additional lessons from leading public <b>sector</b> <b>entities.</b> Practical implications – Business managers should take seriously the potential to learn from leading public <b>sector</b> <b>entities.</b> Originality/value – The paper provides a challenge to conventional wisdom that public <b>sector</b> <b>entities</b> should learn from business, rather than the other way round, by examining two leading edge public sector entities; Singapore Airlines and the National Library Board of Singapore...|$|R

This study attempts to answer the following research question: how to gain full benefit from accounting information in public <b>sector</b> <b>entities.</b> As to general scientific research methods, mainly comparative analysis and description were used. This study reveals as follows. Firstly, approach to accrual accounting leads to financial information that fulfils needs for true and fair accounting data for decision making purposes.

The simple dynamic ordinary least squares regression was used to analyze how <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> development in Ghana contributes in attracting FDI to promote economic growth. It was found out that improvement in <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> in Ghana leads to more inflows of foreign direct investment. The FDI with the interaction term and <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> development has a significant positive impact on current real gross domestic product. This implied that FDI works through the domestic <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> to affect the economic performance of the Ghanaian economy positively. Thus, the <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> development is a key for FDI inflows to impact positively on the economic performance of the Ghanaian economy. The Granger causality test also showed that there is unidirectional causality from real gross domestic product to FDI, <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> development to FDI.
