5|$|Knowing that Cleomenes <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> {{to pay for}} his mercenaries from Ptolemy, Antigonus, {{according}} to Peter Green, seems to have ceded some territory in Asia Minor to Ptolemy in return for Ptolemy withdrawing his financial support of Sparta. Whether this assumption is accurate or not, Ptolemy certainly withdrew his support, which left Cleomenes without money {{to pay for his}} mercenaries. Desperate, Cleomenes freed all helots able to pay five Attic minae; in this way he accumulated 500 talents of silver. He also armed 2,000 of the ex-helots in Macedonian style to counter the White Shields, the Macedonian crack troops, before planning a major initiative.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, an American {{company had}} gained a {{concession}} for a railroad between Hankow and Szechuan, but the Chinese revoked the agreement in 1904 {{after the company}} (which was indemnified for the revocation) breached the agreement by selling a majority stake outside the United States. The Chinese imperial government <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> for the indemnity from the British Hong Kong government, on condition British subjects would be favored if foreign capital was needed to build the railroad line, and in 1909, a British-led consortium began negotiations. This came to Knox's attention in May of that year, and he demanded that U.S. banks be allowed to participate. Taft appealed personally to the Prince Regent, Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and was successful in gaining U.S. participation, though agreements were not signed until May 1911. However, the Chinese decree authorizing the agreement also required the nationalization of local railroad companies in the affected provinces. Inadequate compensation was paid to the shareholders, and these grievances were among those which touched off the Chinese Revolution of 1911.|$|E

However, McKenzie's appearance was overshadowed by stories relating to £1 million winner Nathan Hageman, as {{it was revealed that}} he had a criminal background; it was initially reported that he had served a five-year sentence for breaking into a man's house and assaulting him, but it was later revealed by The Sun that he had in fact been convicted of attacking an ex–girlfriend. This led to the newspaper and Labour MP Hazel Blears calling for Hageman to be stripped of his prize money. ITV had conducted a CRB check on each finalist towards the end of July, over a month prior to the first live show. When later discussing the incident, Simon Cowell said, [...] "I'm {{not in a position to}} force anyone to do anything.

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1977, Nelson {{discovered}} that Reshen had been filing tax extensions and not paying the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) since he took over as his manager. In June, a package containing cocaine was sent from Reshen's office in New York to Jennings in Nashville. The package {{was followed by the}} DEA, and Jennings was arrested. The charges were later dropped, since Reshen's assistant, Mark Rothbaum stepped in and took the charges. Rothbaum was sentenced to serve time in jail. Impressed by his attitude, Nelson fired Reshen and hired Rothbaum as his manager. In 1978, Nelson released two more platinum albums. One, Waylon & Willie, was a collaboration with Jennings that included [...] "Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys", a hit single written and performed by Ed Bruce. Though observers predicted that Stardust would ruin his career, it went platinum the same year. Nelson continued to top the charts with hit songs during the late 1970s, including [...] "Good Hearted Woman", [...] "Remember Me", [...] "If You've <b>Got</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money</b> I've Got the Time", and [...] "Uncloudy Day".|$|E

As a child, Dougan would usually spend between four and eight hours a day playing football in the street. His family were poor, and later in life Dougan joked that [...] "on the street where I lived, if you paid your rent three weeks on the trot, the police used to come and see where you <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> from". As a teenager he spent 18 months working at a toy factory whilst playing amateur football for Cregagh Boys. He also trained with Linfield, but could not break into any of their junior teams. He instead joined Distillery in 1953. Manager Jimmy McIntosh handed him his first team debut on 5 February 1955, in a 0–0 Irish Cup first [...] round draw with Glentoran. Maurice Tadman, who succeeded McIntosh as the club's manager in the summer of 1955, preferred to use Dougan as a target man centre-forward, as Dougan's height made him adept at winning and flicking on headers in the opposition penalty area.|$|E

As part of the government's Multi-Million Dollar Award Programme (MAP), she received S$23,750 for winning three individual titles and one team gold at the 2007 SEA Games. She was therefore [...] "taxed" [...] S$3,562.50, with S$1,425 going to youth development.

[...] She itereited that it [...] been her school and not the SSA which had borne the expense of her overseas training. The SSA said it was [...] "very disappointed" [...] with her comments, and pointed out that the association had spent [...] "easily in excess of $20,000" [...] in sending her for competitions abroad such as the World Championships, Hong Kong Open and Japan International, and a stint at the Australian Institute of Sport.

500|$|Edgar Poe {{was unable}} to {{complete}} studies at the University of Virginia due to gambling debts. He left the university in March 1827 and the already-strained relationship with his foster father, John Allan, grew worse. Poe determined to go to Boston, where he was born.

[...] John Allan, a merchant in Richmond, Virginia, refused to give his foster son the $12 for the trip, though it is likely Poe <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> from his foster mother Frances Allan. John Allan was not aware of Poe's decision or whereabouts and, not concerned, wrote [...] "I'm thinking Edgar has gone to Sea to seek his own fortunes". After arriving in Boston in April 1827, Poe served briefly as clerk for a wholesale merchandise warehouse on the waterfront, then as an office clerk and reporter for an obscure newspaper, the Weekly Report. After several weeks, in desperation, he enlisted in the United States Army for a five-year term under the pseudonym [...] "Edgar A. Perry"; he gave his age as 22, though he was only 18, likely because he would have needed parental consent if under 21.

2500|$|While Paths of Glory {{did not do}} well at the box office, it {{has since}} {{become one of the}} great anti-war films, and one of early films by {{director}} Stanley Kubrick. Douglas, a fluent French speaker, plays a sympathetic French officer during World War I who tries to save three soldiers from the firing squad. Biographer Vincent LoBrutto describes Douglas's [...] "seething but controlled portrayal exploding with the passion of his convictions at the injustice leveled at his men." [...] The film was banned in France until 1976. Before production of the film began, however, Douglas and Kubrick had to work out some major issues, one of which was Kubrick's rewriting the screenplay without informing Douglas first. It led to their first major argument: [...] "I called Stanley to my room... I hit the ceiling. I called him every four-letter word I could think of... 'I <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> based on that [...] script. Not this shit!' I threw the script across the room. 'We're going back to the original script, or we're not making the picture.'
