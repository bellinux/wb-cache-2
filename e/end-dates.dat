40|$|In {{the present}} study, the phenological and {{quantitative}} {{changes in the}} pollen seasons between 1973 and 2013 in the Stockholm region of Sweden were studied for nine types of pollen (hazel, alder, elm, birch, oak, grass, mugwort, willow and pine). Linear regression models were used to estimate the long term trends in duration, start- and <b>end-dates,</b> peak-values and the yearly accumulated pollen sums of the pollen seasons. The pollen seasons of several arboreal plant species (e. g. birch, oak and pine) were found to start significantly earlier today compared to 41 years earlier, and have an earlier peak-date, while the season of other species seemed largely unaffected. However, the long term trends in the <b>end-dates</b> of pollen seasons differed between arboreal and herbaceous species. For herbaceous species (grass and mugwort), a significant change towards later <b>end-dates</b> was observed and the duration of season {{was found to have}} increased. A significant trend towards an earlier end-date was found in the majority of the arboreal plant species (i. e. elm, oak, pine and birch), but the length of the season seemed unaffected. A trend towards an increase in yearly concentrations of pollen was observed for several species; however the reasons for this phenomenon cannot be explained unambiguously by the present study design. The trend of increasing yearly mean air temperatures in the Stockholm area may be the reason to changed phenological patterns of pollen seasons...|$|E

40|$|Researchers {{have been}} {{investigating}} the sigmoid relationship between progressive time and cash flow for many years. Recent attention has turned toward forecasting {{the outcome of}} the project while the project is in progress. In a recent work, Kaka (1999) developed a nomothetic method for assessing the probability of a project suffering a project time over-run, using a stochastic analysis of past project data. This paper further develops this model, providing an idiographic tool for forecasting the completion date of fixed lump sum projects progressively during the project. The original project forecast cash flow is used as the seed for the analysis, as an alternative to Kaka's historic data model, to determine the success of that profile in forecasting the final end date. The results indicate the potential for great accuracy, but only where the forecast profile approximates the actual project profile. In turn this highlights the need for relevant profiles to be used and the data suggests that insufficient attention may be devoted to this takes prior to contract commencement. The paper concludes that a melding of Kaka's stochastic modelling of past projects with this new method of forecasting <b>end-dates</b> should form the basis of further research...|$|E
40|$|Pastoralist {{households}} across East Africa face major livestock losses during drought periods {{that can}} cause persistent poverty. For Kenya and southern Ethiopia, an existing index insurance scheme aims to reduce the adverse effects of such losses. The scheme insures individual households through an area-aggregated seasonal forage scarcity index derived from remotely-sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. Until recently, insurance contracts covered animal losses and indemnity payouts were consequently made late in the season, based on a forage scarcity index incorporating both wet and dry season NDVI data. Season timing and duration were fixed for the whole area (March–September for long rains, October–February for short rains). Due to demand for asset protection insurance (pre-loss intervention) {{our aim was to}} identify earlier payout options by shortening the temporal integration period of the index. We used 250 m-resolution 10 -day NDVI composites for 2001 – 2014 from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). To better describe the period during which forage develops, we first retrieved per-pixel average season start- and <b>end-dates</b> using a phenological model. These dates were averaged per insurance unit to obtain unit-specific growing period definitions. With these definitions a new forage scarcity index was calculated. We then examined if shortening the temporal period further could effectively predict most (> 90 %) of the interannual variability of the new index, and assessed the effects of shortening the period on indemnity payouts. Our analysis shows that insurance payouts could be made one to three months earlier as compared to the current index definition, depending on the insurance unit. This would allow pastoralists to use indemnity payments to protect their livestock through purchase of forage, water, or medicines. Peer Revie...|$|E
40|$|In the rapidly-changing {{environment}} {{of a college}} campus, administrators seeking to lead routine, incremental changes are often {{left to their own}} devices, confronting resistance whose origins may be difficult to gauge. The individual manager may learn from the experience, but is often simply too busy to analyze the lessons learned to put them into practice in the next planned change. It is even harder for the manager to share lessons learned with others in the institution in any organized way; instead, the same problems with implementation are experienced repeatedly. ^ This dissertation is a qualitative study using the case study method of inquiry designed to better understand the influences of organizational culture and subcultures on incremental change strategies in higher education. The study examined two incremental change initiatives that were implemented over several years at Yale University, to determine how certain factors within the organizational culture or subcultures may have influenced implementation of the planned changes. ^ Using Bergquist 2 ̆ 7 s cultural model of the academy as a basis for understanding different cultures that are manifest in higher education, the study researched how the planned changes were initiated, and how faculty and staff perceived the changes based upon their affiliation with occupational or organizational subcultures. The results suggest that those leading incremental change in higher education should consider factors including the need for thoughtful planning and articulating desired outcomes at the onset of change, the need for organized training and communication efforts, the importance of working towards clear, measurable results and project <b>end-dates,</b> and the critical need for a culturally-sensitive approach to planned change. ...|$|E

40|$|Ph. D. This thesis {{investigates the}} impact of {{domestic}} and foreign financial crises on volatility dynamics in South Africa. In a sample ranging from January 1994 to March 2009, Chapter 2 provides empirical support for the theory that domestic currency crises are associated with significant structural changes in daily exchange rate volatility. Speciacally, crisis periods coincide with large positive shifts in unconditional variance. Using this fact, we propose a new method - the structural change generalised conditional heteroskedasticity, or SC-GARCH, model - for identifying precise start- and <b>end-dates</b> for crises. Chapter 3 studies volatility transmission within SA from October 1996 to June 2010. Using a generalised version of the vector autoregressive (VAR) approach, time-varying and bidirectional volatility spillover indices are esti- mated for domestic currency, bond and equity markets. The results identify equities as {{the primary source of}} volatility transfer to other asset classes. At di erent points in time, spillovers are responsible for anywhere between 7. 5 and 65 percent of system-wide volatility. Local maxima in spillover magni- tudes are estimated during domestic, as well as foreign crisis periods. Chapter 4 estimates time-varying comovement between SA and world volatilities during the period from 1994 to 2008. A dynamic factor model (FM) is used to extract three latent global volatility factors from a data panel which is representative of the world equity market portfolio. Relative to most other emerging markets, the global factors are poor predictors of volatility in SA. However, SA's comovement with global volatility increases sharply in response to emerging market crises in Asia (1997 - 8) and Russia (1998). The global factors are also important determinants of domestic volatility during the latter stages of the US subprime crisis (2007 - 8). Chapter 5 proposes the factor-augmented VAR as a parsimonious model for the transmission of foreign volatility shocks to SA equities. We compare international volatility transmission resulting from crises in Asia (1997 - 8) and the US (2007 - 8). Although the US crisis has a larger impact on the world equity market, the Asian shock leads to more dramatic increases in volatility in emerging economies, including SA...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This article {{reports on}} 12 new {{accelerator}} mass spectrometry (AMS) {{dates from the}} latest phases of the Chalcolithic period occupation (late 5 th millennium cal BC) at Teleilat Ghassul, type site for the south Levantine Ghassulian Chalcolithic culture. The new AMS dates from Teleilat Ghassul favor an amendment to a previous suggestion (Bourke et al. 2001), that all significant occupation at the site had ceased by 4000 / 3900 cal BC. This <b>end-date</b> should now be amended to 3900 / 3800 cal BC. Follow-up statistical modelling sourced to published 14 C data drawn from {{a wide selection of}} south Levantine Chalcolithic period sites (Bourke 2001; Burton and Levy 2001) raises the possibility that Chalcolithic period occupation had ceased at virtually all major centers by 3800 / 3700 cal BC.
