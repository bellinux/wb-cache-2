50|$|First of all, {{to analyze}} what an {{economic}} crisis <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know what the symptoms of a healthy economy are. There should be progressive increase in the sustainable growth in behalf of the government, the economy and society as a whole. Something crucial for the country is the trade balance, which should mediate the amount of importations with the exportations. Also, the currency has to be revalued {{in order to have}} a controlled inflation within all the areas. The government also has to be very careful in the amount of money that runs among the pockets of the people, because that’s what determines product prices and inflation. Unemployment rates also have to be no more than a digit to be considered a country with healthy economic symptoms in relation to all the population, not a few favored. Now knowing the symptoms of a healthy economy we can take into account what {{an economic crisis}} is and how does it become global.|$|E

It’s a very honest record, but I'm really happy with it.".
