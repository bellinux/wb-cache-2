Then he became aware of a very strange sensation. He felt as though something were flowing from that woman to him, some strange and concentrated power of thought which was changing into a kind of agony of joy. The woman above him began to breathe quickly, in sighs as it were, and he knew that she was stirred; he knew that she was wondering.|$|E

An Incident.--In one of the rights before Atlanta, a rebel soldier, of large size, evidently a young man, was mortally wounded top of the head, so that the brains partially exuded.

It is only by using Major Vernons lower jaw bone, that Riley digs himself up from the grave, which takes him thirteen hours. After a quick rest, he makes for the border, and within days, is struck by dehydration and delirium. He has vague memories of people helping him, {{but by the time he}} makes it across the border, about a month later, he has badly infected cuts, sores and wounds, is badly dehydrated and delirious. He collapses in the sand and <b>just</b> <b>lays</b> <b>there</b> to die. He is later found by a Texas sheriff who takes him to a hospital. The story then jumps to December 18, 2010 (four months and a few weeks later); Riley is being debriefed about his experience to his superiors. Physically Riley is fine, but his superiors fear that his mental state is still in question. Riley has nightmares, with Roba haunting and taunting him. After one of his nightmares, his mother and he have a small talk, and he learns a few things about his father that are both disturbing, but meaningful to the plot as well.|$|R

6000|$|... "Hardly was {{the thought}} {{out of my}} head when I caught sight in the {{moonlight}} of the lioness bounding along through the long grass, and after her a couple of cubs about the size of mastiffs. She stopped within a few feet of my head, and stood, waved her tail, and fixed me with her glowing yellow eyes; but just as I thought that it was all over she turned and began to feed on Kaptein, and so did the cubs. There were four of them within eight feet of me, growling and quarrelling, rending and tearing, and crunching poor Kaptein's bones; and there I lay shaking with terror, and the cold perspiration pouring out of me, feeling like another Daniel come to judgment in a new sense of the phrase. Presently the cubs had eaten their fill, and began to get restless. One went round {{to the back of the}} waggon and pulled at the Impala buck that hung there, and the other came round my way and commenced the sniffing game at my leg. Indeed, he did more than that, for my trouser being hitched up a little, he began to lick the bare skin with his rough tongue. The more he licked the more he liked it, to judge from his increased vigour and the loud purring noise he made. Then I knew that the end had come, for in another second his file-like tongue would have rasped through the skin of my leg--which was luckily pretty tough--and have tasted the blood, and then there would be no chance for me. So I <b>just</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> and thought of my sins, and prayed to the Almighty, and reflected that after all life was a very enjoyable thing.|$|E
6000|$|... 'His debilitated body {{shook with}} an exultation so vehement, so assured, and so {{malicious}} {{that it seemed}} to have driven off the death waiting for him in that hut. The corpse of his mad self-love uprose from rags and destitution as from the dark horrors of a tomb. It is impossible to say how much he lied to Jim then, how much he lied to me now--and to himself always. Vanity plays lurid tricks with our memory, and the truth of every passion wants some pretence to make it live. Standing at the gate of the other world {{in the guise of a}} beggar, he had slapped this world's face, he had spat on it, he had thrown upon it an immensity of scorn and revolt at the bottom of his misdeeds. He had overcome them all--men, women, savages, traders, ruffians, missionaries--and Jim--"that beefy-faced beggar." [...] I did not begrudge him this triumph in articulo mortis, this almost posthumous illusion of having trampled all the earth under his feet. While he was boasting to me, in his sordid and repulsive agony, I couldn't help thinking of the chuckling talk relating to the time of his greatest splendour when, during a year or more, Gentleman Brown's ship was to be seen, for many days on end, hovering off an islet befringed with green upon azure, with the dark dot of the mission-house on a white beach; while Gentleman Brown, ashore, was casting his spells over a romantic girl for whom Melanesia had been too much, and giving hopes of a remarkable conversion to her husband. The poor man, some time or other, had been heard to express the intention of winning [...] "Captain Brown to a better way of life." [...] "Bag Gentleman Brown for Glory"--as a leery-eyed loafer expressed it once--"just to let them see up above what a Western Pacific trading skipper looks like." [...] And this was the man, too, who had run off with a dying woman, and had shed tears over her body. [...] "Carried on like a big baby," [...] his then mate was never tired of telling, [...] "and where the fun came in may I be kicked to death by diseased Kanakas if I know. Why, gents! she was too far gone when he brought her aboard to know him; she <b>just</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> on her back in his bunk staring at the beam with awful shining eyes--and then she died. Dam' bad sort of fever, I guess. [...] ." [...] I remembered all these stories while, wiping his matted lump of a beard with a livid hand, he was telling me from his noisome couch how he got round, got in, got home, on that confounded, immaculate, don't-you-touch-me sort of fellow. He admitted that he couldn't be scared, but there was a way, [...] "as broad as a turnpike, to get in and shake his twopenny soul around and inside out and upside down--by God!"' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Meanwhile {{he wandered}} about the courtyard, shunned by some, glared at by others, but watched by all, and {{practically}} {{at the mercy}} of the first casual ragamuffin with a chopper, in there. He took possession of a small tumble-down shed to sleep in; the effluvia of filth and rotten matter incommoded him greatly: it seems he had not lost his appetite though, because--he told me--he had been hungry all the blessed time. Now and again [...] "some fussy ass" [...] deputed from the council-room would come out running to him, and in honeyed tones would administer amazing interrogatories: [...] "Were the Dutch coming to take the country? Would the white man like to go back down the river? What was the object of coming to such a miserable country? The Rajah wanted to know whether the white man could repair a watch?" [...] They did actually bring out to him a nickel clock of New England make, and out of sheer unbearable boredom he busied himself in trying to get the alarum to work. It was apparently when thus occupied in his shed that the true perception of his extreme peril dawned upon him. He dropped the thing--he says--"like a hot potato," [...] and walked out hastily, without the slightest idea of what he would, or indeed could, do. He only knew that the position was intolerable. He strolled aimlessly beyond a sort of ramshackle little granary on posts, and his eyes fell on the broken stakes of the palisade; and then--he says--at once, without any mental process as it were, without any stir of emotion, he set about his escape as if executing a plan matured for a month. He walked off carelessly to give himself a good run, and when he faced about there was some dignitary, with two spearmen in attendance, close at his elbow ready with a question. He started off [...] "from under his very nose," [...] went over [...] "like a bird," [...] and landed on the other side with a fall that jarred all his bones and seemed to split his head. He picked himself up instantly. He never thought of anything at the time; all he could remember--he said--was a great yell; the first houses of Patusan were before him four hundred yards away; he saw the creek, and as it were mechanically put on more pace. The earth seemed fairly to fly backwards under his feet. He took off from the last dry spot, felt himself flying through the air, felt himself, without any shock, planted upright in an extremely soft and sticky mudbank. It was only when he tried to move his legs and found he couldn't that, in his own words, [...] "he came to himself." [...] He began to think of the [...] "bally long spears." [...] As a matter of fact, considering that the people inside the stockade had to run to the gate, then get down to the landing-place, get into boats, and pull round a point of land, he had more advance than he imagined. Besides, it being low water, the creek was without water--you couldn't call it dry--and practically he was safe for a time from everything but a very long shot perhaps. The higher firm ground was about six feet in front of him. [...] "I thought I would have to die there all the same," [...] he said. He reached and grabbed desperately with his hands, and only succeeded in gathering a horrible cold shiny heap of slime against his breast--up to his very chin. It seemed to him he was burying himself alive, and then he struck out madly, scattering the mud with his fists. It fell on his head, on his face, over his eyes, into his mouth. He told me that he remembered suddenly the courtyard, as you remember a place where you had been very happy years ago. He longed--so he said--to be back there again, mending the clock. Mending the clock--that was the idea. He made efforts, tremendous sobbing, gasping efforts, efforts that seemed to burst his eyeballs in their sockets and make him blind, and culminating into one mighty supreme effort in the darkness to crack the earth asunder, to throw it off his limbs--and he felt himself creeping feebly up the bank. He lay full length on the firm ground and saw the light, the sky. Then as a sort of happy thought the notion came to him that he would go to sleep. He will have it that he did actually go to sleep; that he slept--perhaps for a minute, perhaps for twenty seconds, or only for one second, but he recollects distinctly the violent convulsive start of awakening. He remained lying still for a while, and then he arose muddy from head to foot and stood there, thinking he was alone of his kind for hundreds of miles, alone, with no help, no sympathy, no pity to expect from any one, like a hunted animal. The first houses were not more than twenty yards from him; and it was the desperate screaming of a frightened woman trying to carry off a child that started him again. He pelted straight on in his socks, beplastered with filth out of all semblance to a human being. He traversed more than half the length of the settlement. The nimbler women fled right and left, the slower men just dropped whatever they had in their hands, and remained petrified with dropping jaws. He was a flying terror. He says he noticed the little children trying to run for life, falling on their little stomachs and kicking. He swerved between two houses up a slope, clambered in desperation over a barricade of felled trees (there wasn't a week without some fight in Patusan at that time), burst through a fence into a maize-patch, where a scared boy flung a stick at him, blundered upon a path, and ran all at once into the arms of several startled men. He just had breath enough to gasp out, [...] "Doramin! Doramin!" [...] He remembers being half-carried, half-rushed to the top of the slope, and in a vast enclosure with palms and fruit trees being run up to a large man sitting massively in a chair in the midst of the greatest possible commotion and excitement. He fumbled in mud and clothes to produce the ring, and, finding himself suddenly on his back, wondered who had knocked him down. They had simply let him go--don't you know?--but he couldn't stand. At the foot of the slope random shots were fired, and above the roofs of the settlement there rose a dull roar of amazement. But he was safe. Doramin's people were barricading the gate and pouring water down his throat; Doramin's old wife, full of business and commiseration, was issuing shrill orders to her girls. [...] "The old woman," [...] he said softly, [...] "made a to-do over me as if I had been her own son. They put me into an immense bed--her state bed--and she ran in and out wiping her eyes to give me pats on the back. I must have been a pitiful object. I <b>just</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> like a log for I don't know how long." ...|$|E

5000|$|Its {{emphasis}} on transgressive themes made The Downward Spirals lyrics vulnerable to criticism from American social conservatives. Senator Bob Dole, then {{the head of}} the Republican Party, sharply denounced Time Warner, the former owner of Interscope's former parent company Warner Music Group, after a meeting between Michael J. Fuchs (head of WMG), William Bennett, and C. Delores Tucker. Tucker and Bennett demanded Fuchs to recite lyrics from [...] "Big Man with a Gun", because they thought the song was an attack on American conservatives by metaphorically claiming within the lyrics they had a jingoistic agenda. Interscope had previously been blamed for releasing gangsta rap albums by rappers such as Dr. Dre, Tupac Shakur, and Snoop Dogg that were deemed objectionable. Reznor called Tucker (who erroneously referred to Nine Inch Nails as a gangsta rap act) [...] "such a fucking idiot", and claimed that the song was actually a satire of the gangsta rap genre as a whole and was originally about madness. Reznor conceded The Downward Spiral could be [...] "harmful, through implying and subliminally suggesting things", whereas hardcore hip hop could be [...] "cartoonish". Robert Bork also repeatedly referenced [...] "Big Man with a Gun" [...] in his book Slouching Toward Gomorrah as evidence of a cultural decline. The book also incorrectly states that it is a rap song. Another form of the Downward Spiral ... deeper & deeper it goes. to cuddle w. her, to be one w. her, to love; <b>just</b> <b>laying</b> <b>there.</b> I need a gun. This is a weird entry ...

On May 4, 1999, a hearing on the marketing and distribution practices of violent content to minors by the television, music, film, and video game industries was conducted before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The committee heard testimony from cultural observers, professors, and mental health professionals, that included conservative William Bennett and the Archbishop of Denver, Reverend Charles J. Chaput. Participants criticized the album, Nine Inch Nails' label-mate Marilyn Manson, and the 1999 film The Matrix for their alleged contribution to the environment that made tragedies like Columbine possible. The committee requested that the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice investigate the entertainment industry's marketing practices to minors.|$|R

5000|$|A {{recurring}} theme in Selvon's character development addresses upward social mobility. This mobility, however, is clouded by the character's designation as the [...] "other". Selvon's characters are offered the worst jobs, they are exploited by housing landlords, and romance for these character oftentimes only includes sex. Their accents and skin colour mark them as outsiders and {{force them to}} form a group identity {{based on the principle}} of congregation via segregation. This analysis allows the reader to better understand the self-hate, disappointment, and struggle that haunts Selvon's characters.

5000|$|Berlander has {{described}} his influences {{of music as}} generally [...] "left-field". He and his sister first listened to nu metal bands like Slipknot and Korn since he was {{eight or nine years}} old. He then got into electronic music and was producing psychedelic trance since he was twelve, which the genre has always been an influence for his works along with other styles of music involving ambient. However, he said in a 2014 interview that he didn't start listening to hip hop until a couple of years before. He first used a Sony Ericsson music application, and once he was bought an expensive computer by his mother, he started [...] "really making shit" [...] with the program GarageBand before moving on to Fruity Loops and other programs, and now uses Ableton Live. He has stated Lil Wayne, Young Thug, Andre 3000, Nas and Lil Ugly Mane to be his favorite rappers, and hopes to collaborate with Drake, PartyNextDoor, or FKA twigs in the future. Clams Casino has been a common comparison with Yung Gud's works, which he addressed in that, like Yung Lean's frequent juxtaposition with Lil B, [...] "It's their only reference because everything else they listen to is straight hip hop. They don't know all the shit that I hear in Clams Casino. They don't hear what he's influenced by. For me, it's like he's just one of them all." [...] He has explained how often he makes his music: [...] "Sometimes I don't do it for months; sometimes I do it all day every day. But it's been the only thing I can think about for six years. I don't care about anything else. ... I care about a lot of things, but I wouldn't care about all of the other things if I didn't make music. All of the other things are based on me doing music in some shape or form. Everything else in life becomes okay or fun if I can do this. If I couldn't do this I’d lay down forever, put a pillow over my head and <b>just</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there.</b> I'd eat and shower maybe once a week, but I'd be posted in one spot forever." ...|$|E
5000|$|Newsweek {{magazine}} {{reported in}} January 1974 that [...] "The dance floor is a dizzy kaleidoscope of lamè hotpants, sequined halters, rhinestone-studded cheeks, thrift-store anythings and see-through everythings. During the breaks, 14-year-old girls on 6-inch platforms teeter {{into the back}} bathrooms to grope with their partners of the moment. Most of the sex is as mixed as the drinks and the drugs the kids bring with them. Twenty years later, author Pleasant Gehman recalled, [...] "I was in {{the age group of}} people who were sophisticated enough to be experimenting with drugs and sex, but way below the age to legally be participating in any of this debauchery. Not only that, it being the Swingin' '70s and all, our very sexuality was one big, fat gray area. Most of us couldn’t decide if we were gay, straight, or bi - and nobody was really keeping tabs, either. Our adventurous spirit actually fit in with the prevalent freewheeling attitude of the time, and mixed with the handfuls of pills we were taking, as well as the Olde English 800s we guzzled in back alleys, it made sexual classifications totally irrelevant. A Newsweek reporter wrote, [...] "Young men who dress like transvestites but almost invariably maintain that they are straight. 'I may dress flash, but I’m no faggot,' sniffs 18-year-old Kenny (Doll) Malloy, sporting a Lurex halter and tight satin pants. 'I do, however, think you’re simply stunning,' he added to Newsweek’s Peter S. Greenberg. Adds Chuck Starr, a 17-year-old prep-school student: 'I'm the No. 1 male groupie in the United States. Last year I had a thing with Mick Jagger. But it wasn’t a physical thing—it was all mental. Me and Mick <b>just</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> and talked all night. 'I'm not gay or bisexual. I’m just glamorous.'" [...] Cromelin also noted at the time, [...] "There are two distinct modes operating at Rodney’s. The more obvious is the extreme narcissism. The kids dress up so painstakingly not to be admired by their friends, but so they may admire themselves. Even if they ostensibly have a partner on the dance floor, each glistening form is alone, drinking {{in his or her own}} image that fades to faceted infinity in the three mirrored walls that surround the floor, fading like the British single whose last distant note will be instantly overwhelmed by the opening bass of the next song before silence is allowed to. At this first level there’s no interest in hustling or in picking up, but there’s plenty of that coexisting. After all, this is Hollywood, where self-furtherance permeates the air like the smog.|$|E
