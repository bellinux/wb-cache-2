5|$|These ancient traditions have modern, reduced versions. Modern houses {{usually have}} no ognji≈°te {{on which to}} burn a badnjak, {{but it may be}} symbolically {{represented}} by several oak twigs, some of which are burnt in a wood-burning kitchen stove and the others placed beside it. Some people chop the badnjak into shorter logs {{so that they can be}} put into the hearth and burnt. The most prevalent custom, however, is to place a cluster of oak twigs, with their brown leaves still attached, in whichever location in the home the family <b>feels</b> <b>is</b> appropriate. This cluster is also called the badnjak, and it is usually kept in the home until next Christmas Eve. For the convenience of those living in towns and cities, such little badnjaks can be bought at marketplaces or distributed in churches. In a common arrangement, the cluster of oak twigs is bound together with twigs of European Cornel and several stalks of straw.|$|E
5|$|Glee club {{director}} Will Schuester {{is informed}} that the school budget will not cover a handicap-accessible bus to transport the glee club to sectionals, which means that Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) will have to travel separately {{from the rest of}} the club. Will encourages the other club members to support Artie, not only by holding a bake sale to raise funds for a handicap bus, but also by spending time in wheelchairs to experience what life is like for him. Meanwhile, Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) is struggling to cover the medical expenses of her pregnancy, and threatens to break up with Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) if he cannot pay her ultrasound bill. Puck (Mark Salling) fights with Finn, whom he <b>feels</b> <b>is</b> not doing enough to support Quinn. By including cannabis in the cupcakes, Puck ensures the bake sale is a success and offers Quinn the money raised. She apologizes for previously calling him a loser, but refuses to accept the money, and is relieved when Finn is able to find a job.|$|E

25|$|In 1997, Trumpets Inc., a Filipino Christian theatre {{and musical}} {{production}} company, produced a musical rendition that Douglas Gresham, Lewis's stepson (and co-producer of the Walden Media film adaptations), has openly {{declared that he}} <b>feels</b> <b>is</b> the closest to Lewis's intention. It starred among others popular young Filipino singer Sam Concepcion as Edmund Pevensie. The book and lyrics were written by Jaime del Mundo and Luna Inocian, while music was composed by Lito Villareal.|$|E
25|$|Roth has her {{doubts and}} fears {{she is being}} asked to become an {{instrument}} of government propaganda. Near {{the end of the}} film, she informs her commercially-minded boss of her plans to call out the senator's new strategy for what she <b>feels</b> <b>is</b> a ploy, but is shot down. Ultimately, Irving's version of the story is run without the critical interaction. Whether Roth gave in and toed the company line or quit her job is not clear.|$|E
2500|$|Another way of {{defining}} qualia is as [...] "raw feels". A raw <b>feel</b> <b>is</b> a perception {{in and of}} itself, considered entirely in isolation from any effect it might have on behavior and behavioral disposition. In contrast, a cooked <b>feel</b> <b>is</b> that perception seen as existing {{in terms of its}} effects. For example, the perception of the taste of wine is an ineffable, raw feel, while the experience of warmth or bitterness caused by that taste of wine would <b>be</b> a cooked <b>feel.</b> [...] Cooked <b>feels</b> <b>are</b> not qualia.|$|R

25|$|The patient being {{examined}} or treated is usually awake during catheterization, ideally with only local anaesthesia such as lidocaine and minimal general sedation, throughout the procedure. Performing the procedure {{with the patient}} awake is safer as the patient can immediately report any discomfort or problems and thereby facilitate rapid correction of any undesirable events. Medical monitors fail to give a comprehensive view of the patient's immediate well-being; how the patient <b>feels</b> <b>is</b> often a most reliable indicator of procedural safety.|$|E
25|$|Wyden is {{critical}} of the estate tax, which he <b>feels</b> <b>is</b> inefficient, and has voted repeatedly to abolish it. He co-authored the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act, which bans internet taxes in the United States. He has also voted with Republicans to lower the capital gains tax, to encourage {{the study of the}} flat tax, and to require a 3/5 majority to raise taxes. However, Wyden voted against the Bush tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003. He has also voted against the balanced budget amendment.|$|E
25|$|Taxpayer {{standing}} is {{the concept}} that any person who pays taxes should have standing to file {{a lawsuit against the}} taxing body if that body allocates funds {{in a way that the}} taxpayer <b>feels</b> <b>is</b> improper. The United States Supreme Court has held that taxpayer standing is not by itself a sufficient basis for standing against the United States government, unless the narrower Flast test is met. The Court has consistently found that the conduct of the federal government is too far removed from individual taxpayer returns for any injury to the taxpayer to be traced to the use of tax revenues, e.g., United States v. Richardson.|$|E

25|$|DuBois {{refers to}} herself as a medium and profiler, rather than a psychic, because of the {{negative}} connotation she <b>feels</b> <b>is</b> associated with the term psychic. She claims that she became aware {{that she had the}} ability to communicate with departed souls when she was 6 years old. DuBois claims she uses this ability to connect deceased loved ones to the living, and also to help law enforcement agencies solve crimes, such as the Texas Rangers and the Glendale, Arizona police department, and that she used these abilities as a jury consultant. These law enforcement agencies have since either denied any such cooperation happened or stated the tips provided by DuBois were not helpful.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{parliament}} {{passed the}} government's {{bill that would}} set election dates on the third Monday in October of the fourth calendar year following polling day for the last general election, thereby reducing the maximum life of a parliament from the time set by the Constitution Act, 1867. The amendment to the Canada Elections Act, however, did not touch the governor general's prerogative to dissolve parliament or call elections, as such is a constitutional matter. Thus, the prime minister may advise such a move whenever he or she <b>feels</b> <b>is</b> prudent. The first election after the amendment was implemented occurred earlier than the date prescribed by the act; Harper argued {{that he had to}} advise an election be called because the minority parliament had become dysfunctional.|$|E
25|$|In a magician's {{house on}} another island, Lucy {{attempts}} {{to perform a}} spell {{that would make her}} tragically beautiful, despite being warned of negative consequences. Just as she is about to say the words, however, she sees an image of Aslan snarling at her, frightening her from reading the spell (in the 2010 film, she reads the spell and turns into a version of Susan and finds her brothers have not heard of Lucy or Narnia). Aslan also reprimands her for using another spell to see what her friends say about her. She encounters a story-spell that she <b>feels</b> <b>is</b> the best story ever that disappears after she reads it, and Aslan reassures her that she will be able to read it again.|$|E

I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that.

25|$|The text, in Book 7, {{describes}} {{the legend of}} a bhagavata (devotee) named Prahlada. He {{is described as a}} boy full of virtues, but who is born to a demon king who is persecuting people for their independent and different religious beliefs in favor of Vishnu. Prahlada disagrees with his father, resists him, and pursues what he <b>feels</b> <b>is</b> right. In this legend, and many others, the text challenges presumption and stereotypes about a person based on birth and heredity, as well as encourages the readers through the character of Prahlada to resist threats, harassment and indoctrination from anyone. The Purana, state Gupta and Valpey, implies that virtues and vices are an individual's attribute and a person must be seen for who he is, rather than assumed to be following his parents because of hereditary circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The Three Book Dunciad has an {{extensive}} inversion of Virgil's Aeneid, {{but it also}} structures itself heavily around a Christological theme. To some degree, this imagery of unholy consecration had been present in Dryden's MacFlecknoe, but Pope's King of Dunces is much more menacing than Thomas Shadwell could ever have been in Dryden's poem. It is {{not a case of}} an unworthy man getting praised that spurs the poem, but rather a force of degradation and decadence that motivates it. Pope is not targeting one man, but rather a social decline that he <b>feels</b> <b>is</b> all but irrevocable. Nevertheless, the poem is still a satire and not a lamentation. The top of society (the kings) may be dulled by spectacle and freak shows, but Dulness is only one force. She is at war with the men of wit, and she can be opposed. In the Four Book Dunciad (or Dunciad B), any hope of redemption or reversal is gone, and the poem is even more nihilistic.|$|E

50|$|Game <b>feel</b> <b>is</b> usually {{attributed}} to spatial games whose mechanics involve controlling {{the movement of}} objects or characters. Since the majority of games are spatial, studies involving game feel mainly focus on the movement and physical interactions between objects in games. The goal of good game <b>feel</b> <b>is</b> to immerse the player in an engaging and rewarding experience. A way to test game <b>feel</b> <b>is</b> to see if interacting with a game's most basic mechanics feels satisfying. At minimum, the game should feel engaging to play even after the plot, points, level design, music, and graphics are removed; if it is not, then the game may suffer from poor game feel.|$|R

25|$|Throughout the process, the {{candidates}} are given around 10 business-themed tasks (11 for the seventh and eighth series), which are designed to test their skills in notable areas - salesmanship, negotiation, requisitioning, leadership, teamwork, and organisation - with each episode covering a single task. Both teams are briefed by Lord Sugar over what the task involves, which also includes the rules they must adhere to (i.e. what they are restricted from doing or using in the task), and the condition for winning the task, with the most common being making the most profit, achieving high sales figures, or {{coming up with a}} concept that Lord Sugar <b>feels</b> <b>is</b> the best (such as branding). Both teams often appoint someone in their team as the project manager (PM), who acts as the team's leader and deals with important key decisions, with the choice usually derived from either a candidate's background, or the amount of confidence the team has in their choice, although Sugar himself can either suggest who the team should pick as their PM, or nominate a candidate into the role, based upon his opinion of their performance in the process, their background, or, since the seventh series, from what he has seen of their business plan. As candidate numbers are whittled down during the process, the team are periodically rearranged, primarily in the task's briefing, either to balance out the number, ensure a fair distribution of skills for a specific task, or to give less vocal candidates a chance to demonstrate their abilities.|$|E
