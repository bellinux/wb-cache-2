This study, therefore, examined the perception of academics on availability of <b>information</b> <b>resources</b> for research productivity in federal universities in Nigeria. Descriptive survey research design was adopted. The Multistage sampling technique was used to select 1, 057 academic staff members from twelve federal universities in the six geo-political zones of Nigeria. The categories of academic staff covered {{in the study were}} from professorial cadre to graduate assistant. The instruments used for data collection were: Availability of <b>Information</b> <b>Resources</b> (r = 0. 69) and Research Productivity of Academics (r= 0. 91). Eight hundred and seventy-three copies of the questionnaire were used for analysis. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient. There was no significant relationship between availability of <b>information</b> <b>resources</b> and academics research productivity. The mean score of <b>information</b> <b>resources</b> availability was adequate in Nigerian federal universities libraries (= 2. 41; SD = 0. 90) which means that <b>information</b> <b>resources</b> were readily available to academics for research productivity.

ABSTRACT: The paper discusses electronic <b>information</b> <b>resources</b> as library materials use for information works in contemporary information age by library staff. The paper purposely identified the available electronic <b>information</b> <b>resources</b> and their extent of use by library staff. The study employed a descriptive survey design. The instrument of data collection is questionnaire while, population of the study comprises 19 library staff who work in Kogi State University Library, Anyigba. Data gathered by use of questionnaire were analyzed by simple percentage to determine availability of electronic <b>information</b> <b>resources</b> (table, 1) and use of available electronic <b>information</b> <b>resources</b> by library staff (table, 2); while mean {{were used to determine}} the extent of use of available electronic <b>information</b> <b>resources</b> (table, 3). The findings shows that out of 20 itemized electronic <b>information</b> <b>resources</b> 8 (40. 0 %) were considered available while 12 (60. 0 %) were considered not available. More to this, out of population of 19 library staff 6 (31. 6 %) know how to use available electronic <b>information</b> <b>resources</b> while, 13 (68. 4 %) do not know how to use them. Furthermore, out of 8 available electronic <b>information</b> <b>resources</b> 5 were used to great extent while, 3 to low extent. Hence, data analyzed in (table 1, 2 & 3) are presented in charts.
