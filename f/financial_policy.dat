5|$|Domitian's {{tendency}} towards micromanagement {{was nowhere}} {{more evident than}} in his <b>financial</b> <b>policy.</b> The question of whether Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus {{at the time of his}} death has been fiercely debated. The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign. Upon his accession he revalued the Roman currency dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the denarius from 90% to 98% — the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87grams to 3.26grams. A financial crisis in 85 forced a devaluation of the silver purity and weight to 93.5% and 3.04grams respectively.|$|E

Overall, Portugal's financial system is sound, well managed and competitive, with shorter-term risks and vulnerabilities quite well contained, and with the system buttressed by a strong <b>financial</b> <b>policy</b> framework. Despite being relatively small and concentrated, Portugal's banking system generally compares well with other European Union (EU) countries in terms of efficiency, profitability, and asset quality, with solvency also close to European levels.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{relationship}} between ownership differences and small firms' <b>financial</b> <b>policies</b> using a survey of U. S. companies. The study finds that <b>financial</b> <b>policies</b> differ according to the type of ownership (private versus public) and by the ownership differences (family-owned, closely-held, or widely-held) within the private firms. The differences are in the ownership concentration, relative importance of various sources of capital, debt characteristics (sources of debt financing, debt maturity, and debt cost). A multiple regression equation estimated in the paper provides evidence relating to cross-sectional variations in debt ratios of small firms. The paper offers information asymmetry, illiquidity, and agency cost explanations for the observed differences in ownership and <b>financial</b> <b>policies</b> of small firms...|$|R

The Committee of Supply debates usually last between seven and ten days, and upon their conclusion a Supply Bill is passed. The enacted law is called a Supply Act.|$|E

In {{that period of}} crisis, there were two great changes in American <b>financial</b> <b>policy,</b> the {{establishment}} of a national banking system and the issue of paper currency. The former was Chase's own particular measure. He suggested the idea, worked out the important principles and many of the details, and induced the Congress to approve them. It not only secured an immediate market for government bonds, but also provided a permanent, uniform and stable national currency. Chase ensured that the Union could sell debt to pay for the war effort. He worked with Jay Cooke& Company to successfully manage the sale of $500 million in government war bonds (known as 5/20s) in 1862.|$|E
