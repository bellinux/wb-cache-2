40|$|It {{was shown}} {{previously}} that CsI sensitivity can be substantially reduced by intense UV irradiation. In {{the present study}} we measure the influence of negative and positive electric fields {{on the degradation of}} CsI photocathode sensitivity when it is subject to a large dose UV irradiation. The UV sensitivity of positively biased CsI photocathodes did not decay as fast as in case of negatively biased films. Thus we found that negative (photoelectron-extracting) electric field not only increases quantum efficiency of CsI photocathodes (as reported previously by Buzulutskov et. al., J. Appl. Phys. 77 (1995) 2138), especially at long wavelengths, but also substantially reduces the long term performance of the photocathode under intense UV irradiation. <b>Electron-repelling</b> electric field (generally used in MCP detectors with opaque photocathodes), on the other hand, significantly reduces aging of the photocathode under UV irradiation...|$|E
40|$|The {{trapping}} {{of electrons}} at surfaces of nanocrystalline titanium dioxide can be decisive in controlling performance for diverse applications in photocatalysis, energy storage, and solar energy generation. Here, we employ first-principles calculations to elucidate the factors which influence electron trapping for all low index surfaces of rutile TiO 2. We show that different surface orientations exhibit markedly different electron affinities: some preferring to trap electrons with others repelling electrons. We demonstrate that local variations in trapping energy {{are linked to}} variations in electrostatic potential and ion coordination providing atomistic insight into this effect. The equilibrium nanocrystal morphology exposes both electron-trapping and <b>electron-repelling</b> facets and therefore is predicted to possess highly anisotropic electron-trapping properties. We discuss how knowledge of surface-specific trapping properties can be utilized to design a number of nanocrystal morphologies which may offer improved performance for applications.

40|$|Novel {{series of}} niacin esters of chalcones 2, 4 and 6 were {{designed}} as antineoplastic agents {{that have the}} potential to release the chemoprotectant niacin. These enones are cytotoxic to human CD 4 (+[*]) T-lymphocyte Molt 4 /C 8 and CEM and murine leukemia L 1210 cells. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies of the biodata in series 4 revealed that cytotoxic potency was enhanced by placing <b>electron-repelling</b> groups in one of the aryl rings. The compounds are lethal to HL- 60, HSC- 2, HSC- 3 and HSC- 4 neoplasms but less toxic to nonmalignant hepatocyte growth factor, hematopoietic progenitor cell and human periodontal ligament fibroblast cells. Hence, the compounds display tumor-selective toxicity. These chalcones are well tolerated in mice and no overt toxicity was noted. The results establish that in general the compounds in series 2, 4 and 6 have positive characteristics which warrant further studies. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Both <b>electron-repelling</b> and electron-attracting anode sheaths in a Hall {{thruster}} {{were characterized}} by measuring the plasma potential with biased and emissive probes [L. Dorf, Y. Raitses, V. Semenov, and N. J. Fisch, Appl. Phys. Let. 84 (2004) 1070]. In the present work, two-dimensional structures of the plasma potential, electron temperature, and plasma density in the near-anode region of a Hall thruster with clean and dielectrically coated anodes are identified. Possible mechanisms of anode sheath formation in a Hall thruster are analyzed. The path for current closure to the anode {{appears to be the}} determining factor in the anode sheath formation process. The main conclusion of this work is that the anode sheath formation in Hall thrusters differs essentially from that in the other gas discharge devices, like a glow discharge or a hollow anode, because the Hall thruster utilizes long electron residence times to ionize rather than high neutral pressures...|$|E
40|$|As was {{reported}} in our previous work, accurate, non-disturbing near-anode measurements of the plasma density, electron temperature, and plasma potential performed with biased and emissive probes allowed the first experimental identification of both <b>electron-repelling</b> (negative anode fall) and electron-attracting (positive anode fall) anode sheaths in Hall thrusters. An interesting new phenomenon revealed by the probe measurements is that the anode fall changes from positive to negative upon removal of the dielectric coating, which appears on the anode surface {{during the course of}} Hall thruster operation. As reported in the present work, EDS analysis of the chemical composition of the anode dielectric coating indicates that the coating layer consists essentially of an oxide of the anode material (stainless steel). However, it is still unclear how oxygen gets into the thruster channel. Most importantly, possible mechanisms of anode fall formation in a Hall thruster with a clean and a coated anodes are analyzed in this work; practical implication of understanding the general structure of the electron-attracting anode sheath {{in the case of a}} coated anode is also discussed.

40|$|The {{alkaline}} hydrolysis of amides follows a simple two stage mechanism, {{the first stage}} being addition of a hydroxyl ion and the second being addition of a hydroxyl ion and the second being decomposition to form the reaction products. The mechanism may be represented wither as a addition and retrogression reaction or as a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The addition reaction requires an intermediate with definite independent existence while the substitution reaction requires a transition complex with no finite period of existence. Ingold has discussed this question and has concluded that the position actually assumed is probably between the two extremes with an intermediate stabilised by mesomerism. The existence of an intermediate with a finite life has been experimentally established {{in the case of}} ester hydrolysis which is in many ways a similar reaction. The status of the intermediate in the amide reaction, as a molecule, can be assumed by analogy. The reaction is thus not a simple substitution reaction {{but on the other hand}} it is not necessarily an addition reaction as normally understood. The most acceptable interpretation of experimental results appears to be given by assuming a resonant intermediate of the dual reaction mechanism as suggested by Ingold. The rate-controlling step in the reaction mechanism is the addition of the hydroxyl ion and it is thus found that electron-attracting substituent groups on the amide accelerate, and <b>electron-repelling</b> groups retard, the reaction. Bevan, Hughes and Ingold have found that in some nucleophilic substitution reactions the loss of the displaced group constitutes the rate-controlling step in the reaction but experimental evidence shows that this is not so for the base-catalysed hydrolysis of amides. Alkyl-groups are <b>electron-repelling</b> in nature and, as expected, are found to reduce the rate of hydrolysis when compared with the unsubstituted amide. The electronic properties of alkyl groups are the sum of two different effects brought about in different ways, an inductive effect and a hyperconjugative effect. In the series methyl, ethyl, iso-propyl and tert-butyl, the inductive effect increases while the hyperconjugative effect decreases through the series. Published data on similar compounds suggests that, in the simple aliphatic amides where the alkyl groups are directly bonded to the reacting group, the order of reactivity should be dictated almost entirely by the inductive effects of the alkyl groups. In the para-substituted benzamides on the other hand, where the amide group is separated from the substituent by the conjugated unsaturated system of the benzene ring, the conditions for hyperconjugation are comparatively much more favourable. The reactivity order may then be either inductive, hyperconjugative, or a mixture of both. All three of these reactivity series have been observed experimentally for different compounds which were not greatly different structurally from the p-alkylbenzamides. The actual reactivity order existing in these amides under a give set of experimental conditions cannot be forecast in any way. In p-alkyl-aromatic compounds, the order or reactivity as well as being considerably effected by minor structural changes may also be altered by changing experimental conditions. This has been observed in ethyl p-alkylbenzoates when the solvent was changed from aqueous ethanol to aqueous acetone. In the work here reported, as study of the kinetics of hydrolysis, in excess of sodium hydroxide in water, of alkyl-substituted acetamides and of p-alkylbenzamides has been carried out. The significance of the experimental results so obtained is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Ion-exchange {{reactions}} are naturally occurring at soil and sediment/water interphases, determining soil fertility and water quality. These ion-exchange reactions with inorganic and organic exchangers {{are applied to}} chemical analysis, recovery of useful ions from low-grade ores (potentially from sea water), water purification including the preparation of “ultrapure” water, production of foods and medicines, therapy, and other uses. It is important to theorize about or to model ion-exchange reactions for quantitative explanations of ion-exchange phenomena and for efficient operation of ion-exchange processes. This paper describes the modeling of ion-exchange equilibria for hydroxyl sites on metal oxides and carboxyl sites in resins with monovalent cations (alkali metal ions), a monovalent anion (nitrate ion), and divalent heavy metal ions. The procedure of modeling is as follows: the stoichiometry and material balance equations of the respective ion-exchange reactions were established based on findings here and by others. The equilibrium conditions were given by the Frumkin equation, where the mass-action relation is modified with lateral interactions between species at the interphase. The model equations were fitted to the measured data and model parameter values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis. The formation of bonds between ions and exchanger sites was evaluated by the equilibrium constant and the suppression of bond formation by electrostatic, geometric, and other lateral interactions was evaluated by the interaction constant. It was established that the properties of ions {{are determined by the}} valence, size, and hydration state of the ions. Monovalent ions (anions and cations) react with oxide surface hydroxyl and resin carboxyl sites as hydrated ions and form loose ion-site pairs by a weak electrostatic bond (nonspecific adsorption). However, the lateral interactions are large because of a large polarization of the ion-site pairs. When the monovalent cations are dehydrated to react with carboxyl sites in narrow resin nanopores, the bond formation is difficult because energy for dehydration is necessary. The suppressive lateral interactions here are small because of a small polarization of the dehydrated ion-site pairs that are in direct contact. Divalent heavy metal ions react with oxide hydroxyl sites by replacing their hydrated water molecules and form ion-site pairs in direct strong contact (specific adsorption). The bond formation becomes easier with increasing charge density of the ions evaluated by the charge/radius ratio, agreeing with the order of these ions to form hydroxo complexes in solution. The suppressive lateral interaction is, however, small for ions with large charge densities, because a strong contact bond reduces the polarization of ion-site pairs by neutralization. The properties of exchangers are functions of the molecular and pore environments around the functional groups. The acid–base nature of oxide surface-hydroxyl groups is determined by the electronegativity of surrounding lattice metal ions, and that of resin carboxyl groups by the <b>electron-repelling</b> effect of adjacent methyl groups. Pores in oxides have diameters sufficient to accommodate hydrated ions, and the suppression is large because of repulsion from ions adsorbed on opposite pore walls (across-pore interaction). Pores in resins differentiate ions that can access or not access sites on the internal surfaces of the pores. Narrow nanopores with diameters less than those of the hydrated ions require ions to dehydrate before they can enter. The ion-exchange reactivity here is small, as described above for dehydrated monovalent ions. In wide nanopores where hydrated ions can enter, bond formation is easier, but suppression is greater because of a larger polarization of hydrated ion-site pairs and also of the across-pore interaction. Macropores have diameters much larger than those of the hydrated ions and the bond formation is the same as that in wide nanopores, but the suppression is smaller because of the absence of the across-pore interaction. Finally, this paper attempts a formulation of activity coefficients of exchanging sites and adsorbed ion-site pairs and compares the proposed activity coefficients of interphase species with that of solution species given by the Debye–Hückel equation...|$|E
