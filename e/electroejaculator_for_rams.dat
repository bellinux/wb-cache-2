40|$|A soil {{grading curve}} {{is one of}} the most useful tools to assess the {{suitability}} of material <b>for</b> <b>rammed</b> earth construction. Different and sometimes contradictory proportions of clay, silt, sand and gravel are proposed <b>for</b> <b>rammed</b> earth soils. This paper investigates the reliability of current guideline values through comparative performance testing of rammed earth specimens. Ten artificial soil batches (five of them stabilised with cement and/or lime) deemed suitable <b>for</b> <b>rammed</b> earth according to the current guidelines were tested in terms of compressive strength, shrinkage and erosion. The investigation shows that complying with soil particle size distribution criteria does not alone necessarily mean suitability of a soil <b>for</b> <b>rammed</b> earth. Based on these results, this paper proposes recommendations and criteria to be implemented in the assessment of soil <b>for</b> <b>rammed</b> earth...|$|R
