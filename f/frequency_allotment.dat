5000|$|WGTV's {{analog signal}} {{was the strongest}} of the GPB TV network, {{covering}} most of {{the northern part of}} Georgia, extending in about a 75-mile (120 km) radius from the transmitter site. WGTV's digital/HDTV facility started broadcasting on December 20, 2007 on channel 12. However, it was at very low power, unable to be received through much (if not most) of metro Atlanta. It moved from channel 12 to full power on channel 8 after the analog shutdown in February 2009, using the same digital transmitter re-tuned to use the channel 8 antenna. This selection, made without conflict in the first-round digital channel election, is due to WDEF-TV in Chattanooga opting to stay digital on channel 12. WGTV was originally assigned channel 22 for DTV operations, but requested the <b>frequency</b> <b>allotment</b> change to channel 12 by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), also allowing a change to 22 (from 59) by WSKC-CD.

40|$|Introduction. The {{prevalence}} of polymorphism - 1486 T/C of TLR- 9 gene in 52 patients with infectious mononucleosis (IM) {{caused by the}} Epstein-Barr virus was studied. Based on the results obtained, three main genotypes - 1486 T/C of the gene TLR- 9 -TT, TC, CC, were identified. The study of the frequency of occurrence of individual genotypes in patients with IV revealed dominance of CC and TT genotypes {{in comparison with the}} control group. The study of the frequency distribution of the - 1486 T/C polymorphism of the TLR- 9 gene for different genotypes showed the specificity of the changes for the CC genotype in patients with IM and the absence of such changes for the TT and TC genotypes. Aim of research. To establish the frequency of the polymorphism - 1486 T/C of the TLR- 9 gene in patients with IM caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. Materials and methods. A study to determine the polymorphism - 1486 T/C of the TLR- 9 gene was conducted in 52 patients with IM. Among them, women - 31 (59, 6 %), men - 21 (40, 4 %) at the age of 18 to 34 years. The control group for studying the {{prevalence of}} the polymorphism - 1486 T/C of the TLR- 9 gene was 40 healthy donors. The mean age was 24, 2 ± 2, 4 years, with a range from 18 to 44 years. To detect DNA VEB using the reverse transcription PCR method with hybridization-fluorescent detection of amplification products, Amplisens (Russia) reagent kits were used. The polymorphic region - 1486 T/ C, rs 187084 of the TLR 9 gene was studied by real-time PCR amplification by determining the length of the restriction fragments-PCR using Ncol restriction enzyme and oligonucleotide primers. Results. An analysis of the results of polymorphism - 1486 T/C of the TLR- 9 gene made it possible to identify three main genotypes - TT, TC, CC. The <b>allotment</b> <b>frequency</b> of the discovered - 1486 Т/С SNP genotypes of the gene TLR- 9 in patients with ІМ was the following: ТТ genotype – 17 % (9 patients), ТС – 46 % (24 patients) and СС – 37 % (19 patients). In patients of the control group wild type of TT genotype was found in 40, 0 % (16 patients), heterozygous ТС genotype - in 45, 7 % (18 patients), while homozygous СС genotype was found in 14, 3 % (6 patients). An investigation of the frequency of occurrence of individual genotypes revealed the dominance of CC and TT genotypes in comparison with the heterozygous genotype of the TC. The study of the frequency distribution of the - 1486 T/C polymorphism of the TLR- 9 gene for different genotypes showed the specificity of the changes for the CC genotype in patients with IM and the absence of such changes for the TT and TC genotypes. Analyzing the occurrence <b>frequencies</b> <b>allotment</b> of - 1486 Т/С genotypes of the gene TLR- 9 in patients with ІМ statistically significant differences of the level р 0, 1). According to the calculated index of the odds ratio presence of homozygous CC genotype in the genome of the patients with IM is specific for the patients with IM (CI: 1, 16 - 9, 2 і OR= 3, 26, consequently) allowing to estimate it as a positive association in comparison with the received indices for homozygous TT genotype (CI: 0, 12 - 0, 82 і OR= 0, 31, consequently) and heterozygous ТС genotype (CI: 0, 46 - 2, 4 і OR= 1, 05), which are estimated as a negative TT genotype association with IM and absence of associations with IM for TC genotype. Our study on polymorphism - 1486 TLR- 9 C/C revealed a correlation with the disease of IM, which confirms the important role of TLR-mediated signaling in the pathogenesis of EBV infection. Investigation of polymorphism among the receptors involved in virus recognition is necessary to determine the genetic background associated with the risk of infection, the course of the disease and the possible consequences of MI. This will allow to identify risk groups among patients and to conduct timely therapy. Conclusions. 1. It was proved that in patients with IM, the polymorphism - 1486 T/C of the gene TLR- 9 was detected more reliably than in the control group. 2. Distribution of frequency of occurrence of polymorphism- 1486 Т/С of gene TLR- 9 allowed to reveal association of genotype СС with manifest forms of IM...|$|R
50|$|These {{changes were}} the first two steps of a three-step process {{designed}} to maximize {{the value of the}} licenses for 94.5 and 97.5. The reallocation of the 97.5 frequency from Trenton to Burlington moved it into the far larger Philadelphia market and made it possible to move the 97.5 transmitter to a site much closer to Philadelphia. This made 97.5 a much more valuable property—one ripe for sale to a major-market broadcast company regardless of what format it might be running. The object of the frequency swap was to allow WPST to continue to operate as a highly popular and profitable Trenton-market station on 94.5, a <b>frequency</b> <b>allotment</b> not suitable for relocation to a larger market. The lower-rated WTHK format was deemed expendable. Nassau chose to leave the final necessary step—the actual relocation of the 97.5 transmitter—to the eventual buyer, which {{would turn out to be}} Greater Media. Since Greater Media already had a Philadelphia classic rock station in WMGK, it was almost certain that a format change would be in order; Clear Channel's decision to drop smooth jazz from 106.1 left a format hole in the market, and Greater Media decided to fill it with a new version of WJJZ on 97.5.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} add more non-attended field {{stations}} to the long range tele-recording seismograph system for local shock observations, two sets of UHF multi-channel radio tele-recording seismographs were designed and constructed. As the allotment of radio frequencies {{in this country is}} now very rigid, we cannot easily increase the number of stations equipped with radio tele-recording seismographs (RTS), assigning many separate frequencies to them all, as was done in Johannesbourg, South Africa. And, accordingly, we must devise the means to set up the RTS equipments, without increasing the frequencies used for transmission. In the new equipment, RTS-II, we adopted 419. 8 MHz P. M. radio waves for both sets, and separate receiving at base was executed by way of radio wave polarization, which was accomplished by using horizontal and vertical YAGI antennae for transmitters and receivers. The directional character of the aerials is also to be utilized to diminish the <b>frequency</b> <b>allotment,</b> setting the field stations in azimuthal positions from the receiving base...|$|E

Thus to affect the wavelengths means finding a coloring of the graph, but because the network is not stable and the topology is dynamic, we need a method which maintains the initial allocation of the frequencies or to look for a new allocation to maintain the stability of the network.
