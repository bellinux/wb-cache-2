They would have increased the desire of others to be buried there, which would have benefited the community by the donations that would have <b>flowed</b> <b>from</b> those wishing to secure their burial. The Liber stresses the burials of Æthelstan, a Bishop of Elmham, that of Ælfwine, another Bishop of Elmham, and Wulfstan II, an Archbishop of York.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, streams <b>flowed</b> <b>from</b> {{highlands}} in central Arizona north and across what is today the western Grand Canyon, possibly feeding a larger river. The {{mechanism by which}} the ancestral Lower Colorado River captured this drainage and the drainage from {{much of the rest}} of the Colorado Plateau is not known. Possible explanations include headward erosion or a broken natural dam of a lake or river. Whatever the cause, the Lower Colorado probably captured the landlocked Upper Colorado somewhere west of the Kaibab Uplift. The much larger drainage area and yet steeper stream gradient helped to further accelerate downcutting.|$|E
5|$|The Castaing {{machine is}} a device used to add {{lettering}} and decoration {{to the edge}} of a coin. Such lettering was necessitated by counterfeiting and edge clipping, which was a common problem resulting from the uneven and irregular hammered coinage. When Aubin Olivier introduced milled coinage to France, he also developed a method of marking the edges with lettering which would make it possible to detect if metal had been shaved from the edge. This method involved using a collar, into which the metal <b>flowed</b> <b>from</b> the pressure of the press. This technique was slower and more costly than later methods. France abandoned milled coinage in favour of hammering in 1585.|$|E

5|$|The 10th-century Persian {{geographer}} Ibn al-Faqih {{wrote of}} a local legend related {{by the people of}} Lajjun regarding the source of the abundant spring used as the town's primary water source over the ages: there is just outside al-Lajjun a large stone of round form, over which is built a dome, which they call the Mosque of Abraham. A copious stream of water flows from under the stone and it is reported that Abraham struck the stone with his staff, and there immediately <b>flowed</b> <b>from</b> it water enough to suffice for the supply {{of the people of the}} town, and also to water their lands. The spring continues to flow down to the present day.|$|E
5|$|This 150-year period next saw the {{eruption}} of less silica-rich lava {{in the form of}} andesitic ash that formed at least eight alternating light- and dark-colored layers. Blocky andesite lava then <b>flowed</b> <b>from</b> St. Helens' summit crater down the volcano's southeast flank. Later, pyroclastic flows raced down over the andesite lava and into the Kalama River valley. It ended with the emplacement of a dacite dome several hundred feet (~200 m) high at the volcano's summit, which filled and overtopped an explosion crater already at the summit. Large parts of the dome's sides broke away and mantled parts of the volcano's cone with talus. Lateral explosions excavated a notch in the southeast crater wall. St. Helens reached its greatest height and achieved its highly symmetrical form by the time the Kalama eruptive cycle ended, about 1647. The volcano remained quiet for the next 150 years.|$|E
5|$|Increased {{precipitation}} {{during the}} Tauca phase was probably {{triggered by the}} southern movement of the ITCZ and the strengthening of the South America monsoon, possibly caused by chilling in the northern hemisphere. Combined with a southern shift of high pressure zones, increased moisture during late glacial times would have <b>flowed</b> <b>from</b> the Amazon. This change, which occurred from 17,400–12,400 years or 18,000–11,000 BP, is recorded in Bolivian Chaco and Brazilian cave records. The Tauca phase may have been triggered by the southern shift of tropical atmospheric circulation. Although another theory posits that vegetation changes and lake development would have decreased the albedo of the Altiplano, resulting in warming and moisture advection of moisture towards the Altiplano, but such positive feedback mechanisms were considered questionable in a 1998 study. Persistent La Niña climatic conditions {{may have contributed to}} the lake's filling. Conversely, a global climatic warming and a northward shift of the monsoon occurred around 14,500 years ago. The ideal conditions for the development of paleolakes in the Altiplano do not appear to exist during maximum glaciation or warm interglacial periods.|$|E

60|$|So {{then the}} Meaning of this Axiom is, that if Rays fall upon any Plane or Spherical Surface or Lens, and before their Incidence <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> or towards any Point Q, they shall after Reflexion or Refraction <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> or towards the Point q {{found by the}} {{foregoing}} Rules. And if the incident Rays <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> or towards several points Q, the reflected or refracted Rays shall <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> or towards so many other Points q found by the same Rules. Whether the reflected and refracted Rays <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> or towards the Point q is easily known by the situation of that Point. For if that Point {{be on the same}} side of the reflecting or refracting Surface or Lens with the Point Q, and the incident Rays <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> the Point Q, the reflected flow towards the Point q and the refracted from it; and if the incident Rays flow towards Q, the reflected <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> q, and the refracted towards it.

25|$|Ulla {{taught that}} the Rabbis ruled {{the skin of}} dead people contaminating so as to prevent people from {{fashioning}} their parents' skin into keepsakes. Similarly, the Mishnah taught that the Sadducees mocked the Pharisees, because the Pharisees taught that the Holy Scrolls rendered unclean the hands that touched them, but the books of Homer did not. In response, Rabban Johanan ben Zakkai noted that both the Pharisees and the Sadducees taught that a donkey's bones were clean, yet the bones of Johanan the High Priest were unclean. The Sadducees replied to Rabban Johanan that the uncleanness of human bones <b>flowed</b> <b>from</b> the love for them, so that people should not make keepsakes out of their parents' bones. Rabban Johanan replied that {{the same was true}} of the Holy Scriptures, for their uncleanness <b>flowed</b> <b>from</b> the love for them. Homer's books, which were not as precious, thus did not render unclean the hands that touched them.|$|E

25|$|In the {{language}} of the Ancient Britons, which survives today as Welsh, Cornish and Breton, the neighbouring rivers, the Glen and the Welland seem to have been given contrasting names. The Welland <b>flowed</b> <b>from</b> the area underlain by the Northampton Sands which in many places are bound together by iron oxide to form ironstone. In the Roman period, the sands were easily worked as arable land and the ironstone was dug for smelting. In both cases, the ground was exposed to erosion which meant that silt was carried down to The Fens by the river. In modern Welsh, gwaelod (from Late Proto-British *Woelǫd-) means bottom and its plural, gwaelodion means sediment. Among the medieval forms of the name 'Welland' is Weolod; the river could have thus been named from its silty nature. In contrast, the Glen <b>flowed</b> <b>from</b> clays and limestone. Areas with clay-based soils tended to remain as woodland whilst the limestone areas provided grassland for pasture. Consequently, the River Glen did not carry much sediment. The modern Welsh for clean is glân. The relative amounts of silt deposited in the fens around Maxey and around Thurlby respectively, by the two rivers, support this view.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a {{framework}} which {{is appropriate for}} the systematic investigation {{of the relationship between}} net (and gross) flows between different labour market states and movements in the unemployment rate. We use that framework to investigate the behaviour of net flows of persons between employment, unemployment and not in the labour force in Australia between 1979 - 2003 and the relationship of these flows to changes in the unemployment rate over that period. We find that: <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> unemployment to employment exceed <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> employment to unemployment and that this is the case even in recessions; <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> employment to not in the labour force exceed <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> not in the labour force to employment and that this is the case even in booms, and; <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> not in the labour force to unemployment exceed <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> unemployment to not in the labour force even in recessions.
