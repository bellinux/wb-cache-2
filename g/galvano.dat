5|$|For Mint Chief Engraver Frank Gasparro, the {{opportunity}} to put Eisenhower on a coin was the fulfillment of a longtime dream. On June 19, 1945, Gasparro {{had been one of}} more than 4 million people who gathered in New York to watch a parade celebrating the Allied victory in Europe. Although Gasparro, then an assistant engraver at the Mint, only saw a glimpse of General Eisenhower, he stepped back from the crowd and drew the general's features. That sketch served as the basis of his design for the obverse. Gasparro consulted with the late president's widow, Mamie Eisenhower, as to the designs of both sides of the coin; the former First Lady was presented with a <b>galvano</b> (a metallic model used in the coin design process) by Brooks and Gasparro on January 1, 1971. Gasparro wrote in 1991 that he had six weeks to complete the work beginning in mid-November 1970, that his extensive research into eagles over the years was a great help in creating the reverse, and that his sketches were adopted without change. The chief engraver was not given full freedom of design; he was instructed to have the layout of the obverse resemble that of the Washington quarter.|$|E

500|$|As Longacre {{worked on}} the double eagle design, {{according}} to numismatist Walter Breen, [...] "Peale, with Patterson's tacit approval, began harassment." [...] Longacre prepared a large model of the new coin in wax, and was instructed {{to give it to}} Peale for use in preparing a metal <b>galvano,</b> which could be used in the lathe. The operation failed, and Longacre's model was destroyed. Longacre had, however, made a cast of his model in plaster, and was able to use it in the machine. [...] The resulting steel die had to be hardened in Peale's department; as Longacre put it, [...] "it unluckily split in the process". According to numismatic historian Don Taxay, [...] "Peale's adoption of a process not normally used at the Mint, together with its catastrophic failures, seems more than coincidental".|$|E

50|$|In 1848, he {{was chosen}} {{to make the first}} postage stamps of France, to be issued on 1 January 1849. From 1848 to 1851, the {{entrepreneur}} Hulot worked in a régie: the French postal administration was responsible for the financial risks and paid for all necessary expenses which Hulot must prove (Barre's drawings and engravings, manufacturing of the printing material, the printer and his workers, paper, ink and gum). A decree transformed the régie into a firm on 7 April 1851. Hulot was then the owner responsible for all risks and benefits, but the <b>galvanos</b> and matrix remain State property. He was paid 1.50 franc for each thousand stamps ordered and delivered to the postal administration.|$|R
6000|$|At first, indeed, his Spanish {{pride and}} stateliness, and Amyas's English taciturnity, kept the two apart somewhat; but they soon began, {{if not to}} trust, at least to like each other; and Don Guzman told Amyas, bit by bit, who he was, of what an ancient house, and of what a poor one; and laughed over the very small chance of his ransom being raised, and the {{certainty}} that, at least, it could not come {{for a couple of}} years, seeing that the only De Soto who had a penny to spare was a fat old dean at St. Yago de Leon, in the Caracas, at which place Don Guzman had been born. This of course led to much talk about the West Indies, and the Don was as much interested to find that Amyas had been one of Drake's world-famous crew, as Amyas was to find that his captive was the grandson of none other than that most terrible of man-hunters, Don Ferdinando de Soto, the conqueror of Florida, of whom Amyas had read many a time in Las Casas, [...] "as the captain of tyrants, the notoriousest and most experimented amongst them that have done the most hurts, mischiefs, and destructions in many realms." [...] And often enough his blood boiled, and he had much ado to recollect that the speaker was his guest, as Don Guzman chatted away about his grandfather's hunts of innocent women and children, murders of caciques and burnings alive of guides, [...] "pour encourager les autres," [...] without, seemingly, the least feeling that the victims were human beings or subjects for human pity; anything, in short, but heathen dogs, enemies of God, servants of the devil, to be used by the Christian when he needed, and when not needed killed down as cumberers of the ground. But Don Guzman was a most finished gentleman nevertheless; and told many a good story of the Indies, and told it well; and over and above his stories, he had among his baggage two books,--the one Antonio <b>Galvano's</b> [...] "Discoveries of the World," [...] a mine of winter evening amusement to Amyas; and the other, a manuscript book, which, perhaps, it had been well for Amyas had he never seen. For it was none other than a sort of rough journal which Don Guzman had kept as a lad, when he went down with the Adelantado Gonzales Ximenes de Casada, from Peru to the River of Amazons, to look for the golden country of El Dorado, and the city of Manoa, which stands {{in the midst of the}} White Lake, and equals or surpasses in glory even the palace of the Inca Huaynacapac; [...] "all the vessels of whose house and kitchen are of gold and silver, and in his wardrobe statues of gold which seemed giants, and figures in proportion and bigness of all the beasts, birds, trees, and herbs of the earth, and the fishes of the water; and ropes, budgets, chests, and troughs of gold: yea, and a garden of pleasure in an Island near Puna, where they went to recreate themselves when they would take the air of the sea, which had all kind of garden herbs, flowers, and trees of gold and silver of an invention and magnificence till then never seen." ...|$|R
500|$|In June 2009 the CFA {{met again}} {{and this time}} {{selected}} a design featuring a modern rendition of the American flag. As {{a part of the}} release ceremony for the last of the 2009 cents on , 2009, the design for the 2010 cent was announced. The design chosen was the Union shield, that was selected by the CCAC. According to the Mint, the 13 stripes on the shield [...] "represent the states joined in one compact union to support the Federal government, represented by the horizontal bar above." [...] The new reverse was designed by artist Lyndall Bass and sculpted by US Mint sculptor-engraver Joseph Menna. In , the coins were released early in Puerto Rico; this was prompted by a shortage of cents on the island. [...] The Mint re-engraved the obverse, returning to the original 1909 <b>galvano</b> in preparing new dies. However, the Mint did not return to striking the pieces in the higher relief of 1909—the piece has long been struck in a much lower relief than the original pieces. [...] Coins of the new design were officially released at a ceremony at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, Illinois, on , 2010.|$|E

[...] He ended up defeating House by a solid margin, winning his first term in the Senate with 59% of the vote to her 41%. He was re-elected to his second term in 2014 without opposition, and was named the Senate Majority Leader for the 2014-2016 Senate term.

He faced Brian Murphy, an optometrist; Benjamin Milks, a Cedar Hammock Fire Control District Commissioner; and David Miner, an attorney, in the Republican primary. <b>Galvano</b> campaigned on his support for providing a clean-up fund {{to deal with the}} fallout from phosphate mining operations attracting more federal dollars to the state, reforming the state's charter school program by requiring a [...] "parental contribution" [...] for families who use vouchers, strengthening corporate fraud laws, enacting a clear air policy statewide, and providing [...] "community-based care" [...] for children in foster care.

[...] Ultimately, however, <b>Galvano</b> defeated his opponents by a fairly wide margin, winning 46% of the vote to Murphy's 31%, Milks' 13%, and Miner's 10%.

During the general election, he attacked Sweeting's platform, noting, [...] "She wants {{to do a lot of}} things for everybody. The question is: Where will the money come from?" [...] He called for the implementation of zero-based budgeting in light of the state's revenue shortfalls. The Herald-Tribune endorsed <b>Galvano</b> in the general election, noting that, despite the fact that both candidates are [...] "thoughtful, well-versed on the issues, and deeply involved in their community," [...] Galvano's [...] "more practical, fiscally conservative approach" [...] would help create a [...] "moderate, bipartisan consensus in Tallahassee."
