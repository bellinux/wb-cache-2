40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} examination of the causes and mechanisms underlying the widespread contamination of a shallow groundwater aquifer by fecal bacteria. The context for this study is a field site located in a rural area of Bangladesh that represents a microcosm for the many challenges facing the approximately 2 billion people worldwide who rely upon groundwater for their daily needs. The unique contributions of this work include an improved numerical model for fitting column test results, a conceptual model to explain seasonal patterns of well contamination based on the hydraulic interaction of ponds and irrigation/drainage canals and a new understanding of the important role that such canals might play in predicting the microbial contamination of shallow aquifers in <b>flood-protected</b> <b>areas.</b> The mechanisms responsible for filtration of the fecal indicator bacteria, Escherichia coli, during passage through the fine sand aquifer were first investigated through laboratory column experiments using intact sediment cores from the field site as well as repacked sediment that had been dried and, in some experiments, chemically cleaned. To fit the hyper-exponential spatial profiles of attached bacteria in one third of the experiments, a finite difference two-population model with reversible and irreversible attachment modes incorporating bacterial die-off was developed. Where the two-population phenomenon was observed, one population typically was highly irreversible while the other was reversible with a smaller irreversible attachment rate. When applied to transport in the field, this model predicted only a two-fold reduction in bacterial concentrations over a distance of 10 m and transport was limited mainly by the bacterial die-off rate, which was also measured using microcosm experiments. The occurrence of the second population was associated with larger grain size and lower percentage of fine particles and the attachment rates in general increased linearly with increasing percentage of fines. Transport from contaminated surface water to nearby tubewells was studied in the field through measurements of bacterial infiltration below canals and ponds both inside and outside of the flood control embankment. A two-dimensional finite element model of the field-pond-canal system was built and fitted to heads measured at three monitoring wells and 2 surface water bodies. Using parameters from the field measurements, the model was not able to explain the seasonal pattern of E. coli concentrations in tubewells, even when reversible attachment assumptions from the column test results were applied. An alternative conceptual model that incorporates the seasonal shift in flow direction caused by the canal network was developed using the fitted finite element model and could explain the observed pattern of well contamination. The importance of the irrigation/drainage canals in determining the frequency of tubewell contamination by E. coli at the site was further demonstrated by applying a logistic regression model using the intensity of latrines, canals and ponds as predictors, after applying spatial decay rates drawn from the infiltration literature. The resulting Intensity Model found that population density, unsanitary latrines and canals together could explain 48 % of the variation in the frequency of E. coli detection in tubewells, but these parameters were only significant at a low spatial decay rate (0. 01 m- 1). A less complex Proximity Model provides nearly the same explanatory power but only required population with 25 m and the distance to the nearest canal as predictors. These models could be useful in predicting water-related health risks, evaluating contamination risk for groundwater sources based on the sanitary environment around the well or estimating the potential benefits from improvements to sanitation infrastructure in a given region...|$|R
40|$|According to legend, a {{very severe}} storm in November 1421 caused catastrophic {{flooding}} and overnight {{loss of the}} larger part of “De Groote Waard”, a prosperous polder area in medieval The Netherlands. Allegedly, more than 25 villages were lost {{and thousands of people}} were killed. But what had really happened? De Groote Waard had become a <b>flood-protected</b> polder <b>area</b> after construction of dikes and damming of smaller rivers was completed in 1283. By 1421, the land surface of most of this area had lowered to below Mean Sea Level, owing to subsidence due to ditch-drainage for agriculture and peat digging for fuel. In November 1421 a severe storm surge struck the area, the St. Elisabeth flood proper. Dikes along the southwestern side of the polder broke and subsided land was flooded. In February 1422, dikes along the tidal river Merwede (lowermost river Rhine) along the north of the polder gave way as well, due to flooding and presence of ice jams in the river bed. River discharge routed through the flooded polder had a gradient advantage relative to the old route. Half-hearted attempts to repair the dikes followed, but regional discord severely hampered adequate repair (“Hoeksche en Kabeljauwsche twisten”). In the autumn of 1424, both the dikes in the southwest (storm surge) and in the northeast (Rhine peak discharge) broke again. In 1425, the larger part of the 1421 - 1424 inundated land was given up. There is evidence for careful dismantling of stone buildings in the now deserted villages. The area (“Biesbosch”) was a large, shallow, fresh-water mesotidal basin, with river sediment entering through the dike breach channel in the northeast. Palaeogeographical reconstructions from old maps shows the formation of a river delta between 1460 and 1680 (Zonneveld, 1960). Both geological reconstruction and sedimentary modelling results suggest that for some twohundred years, the equivalent of the full Rhine river bed load sand was trapped in the area (550, 000 to 900, 000 m 3 / year; Kleinhans et al., 2010). Only centuries later, after natural river sedimentation had healed this man+sea+river created scar in the delta, could the Biesbosch lost medieval polder be partially reclaimed for agriculture once again. So what had really happened? Not so much the severity of a single storm surge, but the combination of land subsidence and socio-economic forces and several flood events were fatal to the prosperous polder. The 1421 – 1424 floods were catastrophic only because of the preceding sinking of the land. Peat digging had been declared illegal, but there was no control on it. Dike maintenance was inadequate, and initial dike repairs failed, probably because of absence / weakness of a central organising power. Zonneveld, I., 1960.
