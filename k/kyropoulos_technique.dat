40|$|We {{report on}} the growth and {{characterization}} of sapphire single crystals for X-ray optics applications. Structural defects were studied by means of laboratory double-crystal X-ray diffractometry and white-beam synchrotron-radiation topography. The investigations confirmed that the main defect types are dislocations. The best quality crystal was grown using the <b>Kyropoulos</b> <b>technique.</b> Therein the dislocation density was 10 $^ 2 $– 10 $^ 3 $ cm$^{- 2 }$ and a small area with approximately 2 * 2 mm$^ 2 $ did not show dislocation contrast in many reflections. This crystal has suitable quality for application as a backscattering monochromator. A clear correlation between growth rate and dislocation density is observed, though growth rate {{is not the only}} parameter impacting the quality...|$|E

These microwave resonators are intended to constitute the frequency reference of ultra-stable Cryogenic Sapphire Oscillators. We conducted systematic tests near 4 K to determine the unloaded Q-factor and the turnover temperature for whispering gallery modes in the 8 – 12 GHz frequency range.

40|$|Nuclear {{resonance}} scattering of synchrotron radiation enables probing hyperfine interactions and element specific vibrational modes of nuclei that exhibit a Mössbauer transition. A prerequisite for {{this method is}} a monochromator with narrow bandwidth. Silicon, as {{the most commonly used}} crystal in monochromators, is not suitable for experiments above 30 keV photon energy. Using a sapphire single crystal in backscattering geometry is an alternative. An x-ray beam with narrow bandwidth can be obtained from a back-reflection with a Bragg angle of a few arcsec to a few arcmin smaller than = 2. The development of a sapphire backscattering monochromator with high energy resolution, better than 1 meV, would permit detailed lattice dynamics characterization of novel functional materials. Sapphire is a very rigid material with desirable optical properties, high chemical resistance, and high heat conduction. Crystals of large size with high quality are of interest for many industrial applications, and suited for optics and optoelectronics operating under ambient condition or extreme conditions. The purpose of the work in this dissertation is twofold. First, study the quality of sapphire single crystals by modern high-resolution characterization techniques in order to acquire microstructural information and thereby {{a better understanding of the}} origin of lattice defects. The second goal is the study of the lattice dynamics in materials based on tellurium and antimony with Mössbauer energies of 35. 49 keV and 37. 13 keV using nuclear {{resonance scattering}} with energy resolution given by one of the highest quality sapphires. White beam topography of more than thirty crystals, grown at the Shubnikov Institute of Crystallography in Moscow, revealed qualitative information about the distribution of lattice defects of which linear defects, i. e. dislocations, are the majority type. The lowest dislocation density of 10 ^ 2 - 10 ^ 5 cm^- 2 was found in C-plane crystals grown by the <b>Kyropoulos</b> and Bridgman <b>techniques.</b> We carried out rocking curve imaging in backscattering geometry to estimate the lattice parameter variation and energy resolution from back-reflections. Minimum variations of the lattice parameters on the order of 10 ^- 8 were observed from spots with an edge length of 0. 2 - 0. 5 mm. There are a few spots with such a quality in one crystal which makes it suitable as backscattering monochromator in nuclear resonance scattering or as analyzer in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. The use of very high energy resolution nuclear inelastic scattering with 0. 7 meV at the energy of the nuclear transition in 121 Sb and 125 Te enables valuable insight into the phonon scattering of thermoelectric materials, that convert heat to prvide electricity and vice versa, composed of Sb and Te. A careful study is done on heat carrying acoustic modes in the partial density of states of (PbTe) mAgSbTe 2, so called LAST-m alloys. An impressive mismatch in the phonon group velocities in the 2 - 5 meV range and di erence in the force constants for the Sb and Te density of phonon states is observed, a phonon mismatch predicted to be responsible for low lattice thermal conductivity in LAST-m. An in-depth understanding of the element-specific dynamic properties of cubic and orthorhombic antimony trioxides was achieved using nuclear resonance scattering with an energy resolution of 1 meV at the nuclear transition energy of 121 Sb. A softening of the Sb bonds upon transformation from cubic molecular structured in alpha-Sb 2 O 3 to chain structured orthorhombic in beta-Sb 2 O 3 is observed. Furthermore, results on the lattice dynamics on alpha-TeO 2, with quasi molecular structure, demonstrate strong interatomic Te bonds, comparable with the strong bonds in molecular structured alpha-Sb 2 O 3. The nuclear resonance data is complemented with inelastic neutron scattering data that reveals the oxygen vibrational modes. In addition, the experimental results validate the calculations of the vibrational modes in these types of materials and serve as benchmark for the calculation...|$|R

We have demonstrated that large Ti(0. 25 atom %) -doped Al(2) O(3) crystals show high chemical homogeneities and good optical properties and amplify the energy without any special annealing.

40|$|Large size {{semiconductor}} crystals {{are being}} requested in several device-oriented technologies. These crystals exhibit various defects (point and extended defects). Indeed, it is well-known {{in the case}} of GaAs that the presence of dislocations strongly decreases the life-time of Ga 1 -xAlxAs/ GaAs lasers. Moreover, it appears now, that the dislocations have a detrimental effect on GaAs integrated circuits. Their presence in LEC (Liquid Encapsulated Czochralski) crystals are mainly due to the thermal stresses occurring during the growth. We present in this paper some experimental results showing {{that it is possible to}} strongly reduce (by a factor 10, at least) the dislocation density either by decreasing the thermal stresses level (Liquid Encapsulated <b>Kyropoulos</b> <b>Technique)</b> or by adding an isoelectronic impurity (indium to the melt) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} was {{the study of the}} influence of crystal fine structure on conductivity and cation self diffusion in single crystals of sodium chloride. Crystals were grown by the <b>Kyropoulos</b> <b>technique</b> and subjected to thermal treatment likely to alter the crystal fine structure. Both annealing and chilling of single crystals produced changes in the crystals conductivity and in sodium- 22 self-diffusion rate at temperatures below 520 ºC. In {{the investigation}} of conductivity a study was made of electrode materials and for the diffusion measurements a sensitive absorption method was used. The changes in diffusion rates and conductivity might have been the result of changes in internal surfaces and grain boundaries. The possibility of ion movement in grain boundaries was investigated by autoradiography of sections of crystal into which sodium- 22 had penetrated. The rte of movement of sodium- 22 on the surface of sodium chloride was also investigate and a limit set for the surface diffusion coefficient. It was concluded that cation movement in sodium chloride single crystals does not take place more rapidly in the grain boundaries or on internal surfaces than it does through the bulk of the crystal. An explanation of the changes in diffusion rates and conductivity on thermal treatment of the crystal is offered in terms of vacancies, rain boundaries and impurity ions...|$|E
