5|$|The {{trial at}} the upper {{regional}} court in Dresden began on 26 October 2009. It took place under strict security precautions due to alleged death threats to Wiens. All concurrent trials were transferred to other local venues, due to the security concerns, the great interest by the national and international media, and the public. El-Sherbini's widower, brother and parents acted {{in the role of}} 'co-claimant' and were represented by eight lawyers. On {{the first day of the}} trial, the entire prosecution counsel constituted of eight lawyers from Germany, France and Egypt was present in court; the defendant arrived in court shrouded behind a mask, sunglasses, hat and a hood. The judge asked the defendant to remove his head attire and to confirm his name and date of birth. The defendant complied, except for removing <b>his</b> <b>sunglasses,</b> for which he was fined for contempt of court. The defence counsel motioned for the judges to be removed from the trial on the grounds of bias as they were colleagues of witnesses and worked near the crime scene. This was denied by a separate panel that had ruled on this motion.|$|E
500|$|For The King of Fighters XIII, K's {{design was}} crafted {{so that he}} had a [...] "cool" [...] appearance. Developers liked the result as his moves, such as putting on <b>his</b> <b>sunglasses,</b> were {{carefully}} detailed. His gameplay mechanics were developed so that gamers who had used him before would not find his new gameplay mechanics strange. In contrast to Kyo's flames, K's were designed with intention of making them look more violent. As a result of various The King of Fighters endings showing K' removing his red glove, a special move was required to show him doing the same thing. After thinking of several methods that would show this, the staff was inspired by The King of Fighters HK Comics printed adaptations in which the character's glove once broke after defeating his opponent, leading to his winpose that happens only after he has used his strongest technique. Following various revisions of K's [...] technique, in order to better follow the material that inspired the move, the staff decided to make K' fight while wearing <b>his</b> <b>sunglasses.</b>|$|E

2500|$|However, {{this is part}} of an {{even bigger}} plan. In the special {{giveaway}} fictional documentary titled Wesker's Report (rewritten in 2003 to include details from Resident Evil 0 and the Resident Evil remake), Wesker reveals that he planned to sell the Tyrant to Umbrella's rival company in the B.O.W. field as a means to buy his way into a high position, and he deployed the elite S.T.A.R.S. against it in order to obtain combat data to prove the Tyrant's effectiveness to the company. However, his plan was ruined after the Tyrant was destroyed by his former subordinates, and he survived his apparent death in the first game by injecting himself beforehand with an experimental variant of the t-virus, provided by his former Umbrella colleague William Birkin, that revived and augmented him with superhuman strength, speed and regeneration, but at the expense of his humanity. Wesker returned in , augmented with superhuman powers and working as an agent for [...] "H.C.F." [...] (Hive/Host Capture Force), a Special Forces unit of the rival company opposed to Umbrella.
