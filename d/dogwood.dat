Atamasco lily, periwinkle, buttercup, Jack-in-the-pulpit, maypops, and jewelweed are sometimes {{found on the}} banks and in the shallows of Lake Phelps. The Scuppernong River provides a habitat for swamp <b>dogwood,</b> evening primrose, blue flag iris and cardinal flowers. The roughleaf <b>dogwood</b> is also found near the river. This particular <b>dogwood</b> is rare in North Carolina and the type along the Scuppernong is rarer still.|$|E
5|$|Five {{species of}} shrubs {{grow in the}} {{vicinity}} of Mahoning Creek, its floodplain, and the nearby slopes: smooth alder, silky <b>dogwood,</b> gray <b>dogwood,</b> spicebush, and American elderberry. 11 herb species also grow in this location. These include skunk cabbage, bloodroot, sensitive fern, sedge, wood anemone, woolgrass, and others. There are also invasive plants such as multiflora rose, Japanese knotweed, and garlic mustard in the area.|$|E

5|$|In January 2008, city {{officials}} {{announced that the}} Peachtree Road Race, Atlanta Pride Festival, the Atlanta Jazz Festival, and the <b>Dogwood</b> Festival would not {{be held in the}} park due to extreme drought. Some festivals which don't make use of green space were still allowed in the park. The Atlanta Arts Festival ran from September 12–14, 2008, and utilized only paved areas. Other festivals were temporarily moved to alternate venues, such as Centennial Olympic Park. The drought in Atlanta ended by late 2009. In 2010, several events returned to Piedmont Park, including the <b>Dogwood</b> Festival, the Jazz Festival, and Screen on the Green.|$|E

New plantings include native shrubs and trees such as red-osier <b>dogwood,</b> elderberry, Indian plum, and willow. City parks adjacent to Johnson Creek have areas devoted to marsh with shrubs, cattails, and smartweed, forested wetland, riparian woodland, open meadow, and orchard trees.|$|E

However, the Mahoning Creek floodplain and {{the nearby}} slopes are listed as a Locally Significant site on the Montour County Natural Areas Inventory. Eastern hemlock trees inhabit the slopes and river birch, silver maple, and silky <b>dogwood</b> inhabit the floodplain itself. American basswood also grows {{in the vicinity of}} the creek here. Additionally, spring wildflowers grow in this area. The site has a high level of plant biodiversity. However, many trees in the area are affected by an aphid species known as the hemlock wooly adelgid.|$|E
5|$|In the Caucasus and Transcaucasia, golden jackals {{primarily}} hunt hares and mouse-like rodents, {{and also}} pheasants, francolins, ducks, coots, moorhens, and passerines. Vegetable matter eaten by jackals {{in these areas}} includes fruits, such as pears, hawthorn, <b>dogwood,</b> and the cones of common medlars. The jackal is implicated {{in the destruction of}} grape, watermelon, muskmelon, and nut crops. Near the Vakhsh River, their spring diet consists almost exclusively of plant bulbs and the roots of wild sugar cane, while during winter they feed on wild stony olives. Around the edges of the Karakum Desert, jackals feed on gerbils, lizards, snakes, fish, muskrats, the fruits of wild stony olives, mulberry, dried apricots, watermelons, muskmelons, tomatoes, and grapes.|$|E
5|$|The capitol grounds cover three {{city blocks}} and include Willson and Capitol parks. Near the west {{entrance}} of the capitol is a replica of Philadelphia's Liberty Bell. This bell is one of 53 full-sized replicas made in France and donated by the United States government to each state. Oregon received its copy on July 4, 1950. Throughout the grounds are native trees and shrubs, including blue spruce, Oregon-grape (the state flower), giant sequoia, coast redwood, Japanese maple, <b>dogwood</b> species, Bradford pear, cherry tree species, English holly, rhododendron, and magnolia tree species. One Douglas-fir tree was grown using a seed that rode aboard Apollo 14 to the Moon in 1971 and was transplanted to the capitol in 1976 from Oregon State University.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dogwoods</b> {{consist of}} morphologically diverse plants, and taxonomic {{circumscription}} and phylogenetic relationships of <b>dogwoods</b> {{have long been}} controversial. My dissertation study has two major goals: 1) elucidate phylogenetic relationships in the <b>dogwoods</b> group using nuclear DNA sequences, and 2) investigate the sequence evolution and its morphological link of the myc-like anthocyanin regulatory gene and explore the phylogenetic utility of the gene in <b>dogwoods.</b> Phylogenetic relationships within Cornus and Cornales (Cornus and related genera and families) were previously investigated using chloroplast DNA sequence data in several studies, but these still remained incompletely resolved. I used nuclear 26 S rDNA sequences to further elucidate relationships within the group and to corroborate previously published phylogenetic hypotheses based on cpDNA and morphological data. Phylogenetic analyses of 26 S rDNA sequence data (~ 3. 4 kb) in combination with sequences of chloroplast genes rbcL and matK, suggest that the aquatic enigmatic genus, Hydrostachys from southern Africa, is sister to the remainder of Cornales among which Cornus and Alangium are sisters, nyssoids (Nyssa, Camptotheca, and Davidia) and mastixioid...|$|R

5|$|The route {{continues}} north, {{serving as}} the boundary between Searingtown and Albertson as it proceeds past side streets lined by homes. At I.U. Willets Road, CR101 serves Henry Wiscardi School and enters Searingtown. Just inside of the community, CR101 intersects Hilldale Drive and <b>Dogwood</b> Road, two local streets connecting to Herricks Middle School. The route continues on through Searingtown into the village of North Hills, where the homes give way to trees as it turns to the northeast and passes under the Northern State Parkway. A short distance after the Northern Parkway overpass, CR101 meets the Long Island Expressway (Interstate495) by way of Nassau Boulevard—the southern service road—and North Service Road.|$|E
5|$|The site of {{the fort}} and warren is now grassy slopes which attract {{a wide range of}} wild flowers and butterflies. The differing soil types provide {{suitable}} habitats for both acid- and lime-loving plants. Kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), harebell (Campanula rotundifolia) and woolly thistle (Cirsium eriophorum) thrive on the dry stony soils. Heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile) and wood sage (Teucrium scorodonia) are found in more acidic areas. The higher areas support bell heather (Erica cinerea), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and common heather (Calluna vulgaris). Trees and shrubs include the wayfaring tree (Viburnum lantana), guelder rose (Viburnum opulus), whitebeam (Sorbus aria), privet (Ligustrum vulgare) and <b>dogwood</b> (Cornus sanguinea).|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{tree species}} have been {{observed}} near Lake Chillisquaque. These include two oak species, two maple spaces, red elm, boxelder, shagbark hickory, black tupelo, American basswood, eastern hop-hornbeam, black ash, and musclewood. Ten shrub species also grow near the lake. These include three <b>dogwood</b> species, two holly species, multiflora rose, Morrow's honeysuckle, speckled alder, spicebush, and mayberry. Eighteen species of herbs live on the lake, as well. Five of these species are sedges. Cattails and beds of grass grow along the shores of Lake Chillisquaque. Additionally, a sizable population of Rotala ramosior grows on the lake.|$|E
