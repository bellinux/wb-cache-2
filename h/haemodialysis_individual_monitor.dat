40|$|Once the EC Directive 96 / 29 {{has been}} {{implemented}} into national regulation across Europe, {{the coordination of}} dosimetry laboratories for the monitoring of occupational exposures becomes the principal aim to achieve. Within this framework the European Radiation Dosimetry Group, EURADOS, carried out an Action on ‘Harmonisation of Individual Monitoring' (2000 - 2004) to promote coordination {{in the field of}} <b>individual</b> <b>monitoring</b> of occupational exposures throughout Europe. With reference to internal exposures, the main aims were the completion of a catalogue of internal dosimetry services and an inventory of methods and techniques used for <b>individual</b> <b>monitoring</b> at European internal dosimetry facilities. At the end of this EURADOS Action, a report was published in Radiation Protection Dosimetry in 2004. The information collected related to various topics: the equipments used for the measurement of internal exposures, calibration and sensitivity data, the methods applied for the assessment of internal doses, Quality Control procedures, Quality Assurance Programmes in the facilities and legal requirements. The information to be presented here will give a general overview of the actual status of <b>individual</b> <b>monitoring</b> for internal exposures in Europ...|$|R

40|$|The European Radiation Dosimetry Group (EURADOS) IC 2012 n intercomparison for neutron dosemeters {{intended}} to measure personal dose equivalent, Hp(10), {{was performed in}} 2012. A total of 31 participants (27 <b>individual</b> <b>monitoring</b> services from Europe, 2 from Japan, 1 from Israel and 1 from USA) registered with 34 dosimetry systems. Participation was restricted to passive or active neutron dosemeters routinely used in <b>individual</b> <b>monitoring</b> of radiation workers. The dosimetry systems were based on thermoluminescence, polyallyldiglycol carbonate, optically stimulated luminescence, fission track detection and silicon diodes (electronic devices). The irradiation tests were chosen to provide the participants with useful information on their dosimetry systems, i. e. linearity, reproducibility, responses for different energies and angles and to simulated workplace fields.

40|$|The {{demography}} of vertebrate populations {{is governed}} {{in part by}} processes operating at large spatial scales that have synchronizing effects on demographic parameters over large geographic areas, and in part, by local processes that generate fluctuations that are independent across populations. We describe a statistical model {{for the analysis of}} <b>individual</b> <b>monitoring</b> data at the multi-population scale that allows us to (1) split up temporal variation in survival into two components that account for these two types of processes and (2) evaluate the role of environmental factors in generating these two components. We derive from this model an index of synchrony among populations in the pattern of temporal variation in survival, and we evaluate the extent to which environmental factors contribute to synchronize or desynchronize survival variation among populations.

40|$|The {{design and}} use of {{standard}} processes are foundational recommendations in many operations practices. Yet, given the demonstrated performance benefits of standardized processes, {{it is surprising that}} they are often not followed consistently. One way to ensure greater compliance is by electronically monitoring the activities of individuals, although such aggressive monitoring poses the risk of inducing backlash. In the setting of hand hygiene in healthcare, a context where compliance with standard processes is frequently less than 50 % and where this lack of compliance can result in negative consequences, we investigated the effectiveness of electronic monitoring. We did so using a unique, radio frequency identification (RFID) -based system deployed in 71 hospital units. We found that electronically <b>monitoring</b> <b>individual</b> compliance resulted in a large, positive increase in compliance. We also found that there was substantial variability in the effect across units and that units with higher levels of preactivation compliance experienced increased benefits from monitoring relative to units with lower levels of prepreactivation compliance. By observing compliance rates over three and a half years, we investigated the persistent effects of <b>individual</b> <b>monitoring</b> and found that compliance rates initially increased before they gradually declined. Additionally, in multiple units, <b>individual</b> <b>monitoring</b> was discontinued, allowing for an investigation of the impact of removing the intervention on compliance. Surprisingly, we found that, after removal, compliance rates declined to below prepreactivation levels. Our findings suggest that, although <b>individual</b> electronic <b>monitoring</b> can dramatically improve process compliance, it requires sustained managerial commitment...|$|R

40|$|Vote buying has and {{continues}} to be pervasive in many electoral regimes. Yet the relationship between vote buying and voting behavior, particularly {{in the context of the}} secret ballot, remains largely unknown. In this paper I study the effect of vote buying on voter turnout in Kenya, using a nationally representative survey that includes questions about the country's 2002 presidential and parliamentary elections. Estimating the causal effect of vote buying on voter turnout is complicated by its strategic nature, and so this study also examines the strategic logic of vote buying in Kenya. The results suggest that poor individuals and “swing ” voters in the country's most electorally competitive districts are vote buyers most likely targets. Using these results, I use matching to estimate that individuals who were approached by a vote buyer were about 14 percentage points more likely to vote than those who were not, while the least educated individuals were the most highly influenced by vote-buying. These results present a puzzle. If voting is secret and voluntary, why does vote buying have this impact?
