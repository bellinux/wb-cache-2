50|$|Made between 1932 and 1936, the {{original}} Contax, known as Contax I after later models were introduced, was markedly {{different from the}} corresponding Leica. Using a die-cast alloy body it housed a vertically travelling metal focal-plane shutter reminiscent of the one used in Contessa-Nettel cameras, made out of interlocking blackened brass slats somewhat like a roll-up garage door. This complex shutter became the characteristic of the Contax camera and its Super-Nettel derivative. By contrast, the competitive Leica followed the established design of using rubberized fabric shutter curtains wound around rollers, moving horizontally. The Contax design allowed a higher maximum shutter speed: the top speed was 1/1000s, then increased to 1/1250s in the Contax II. The fact the shutter ran across the shorter dimension of the <b>format</b> <b>area</b> was a significant factor for achieving this technical feat. The interlocking slats were aligned by specially woven silk ribbons, which were very strong but subject to wear. Replacing these ribbons was difficult but, contrary to modern cameras, made for a 400,000-cycle life.Zeiss also invented the System Camera, {{with all sorts of}} near-photo, wide-angle, mirror-house, long-focal-length lenses for specific situations. However Zeiss called it Universalkamera.One of the key design features was a coupled rangefinder with a very long baseline, with its own eyepiece next to that of the viewfinder. To enhance accuracy, a novel rotating wedge system was employed in lieu of the common swinging mirror mechanism. Other main features included focusing drive built into the camera body for use with standard lens, removable back, shutter-speed knob integral with film-wind knob placed {{at the front of the}} camera body, and black-enamelled finish.|$|E

This paper state the issues related to Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing protocol, currently that supports routing of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv 4) and 6 (IPv 6) and study both the strong and weak points of IS-IS routing protocol. This paper illustrate the working of IS-IS and issues (Routing, addressing, packet <b>format,</b> <b>area</b> and domain) related to IS-IS {{because it will be}} helpful for understanding the key things related to IS-IS. There are various intra routing protocols among which OSPF is very popular but IS-IS is more flexible than OSPF. This paper also gives some prospective ideas that why we can’t ignore IS-IS.

40|$|This is {{a content}} {{analysis}} on {{the coverage of the}} ethnic Chinese community by The Toronto Star and The Vancouver Sun from 1970 to 1990. 783 news items were analyzed, representing all of 1990 and half of 1980 and 1970 reportage in both papers. Sampling differences were weighted for real numbers. Over time, coverage showed substantial increase in story number, length, layout, <b>format,</b> <b>areas</b> of interest and themes. Coverage growth in the 1980 s far surpassed ethnic Chinese population growth, implying the new image of ethnic Chinese did not merely result from demographic expansion. This was made clearer by a sharp rise in economic and crime stories which broke a previous dominance of 2 ̆ 7 soft, 2 ̆ 7 cultural stories. Such increases confirmed that the recent thriving of the Chinese community, especially economically, received more attention from the Canadian press and public opinion.
