2500|$|On one account, {{moments before}} his death, Beethoven was laying upon bed, pale and suffering, {{when a man}} entered. It was fellow {{composer}} Johann Nepomuk Hummel, who was Beethoven's old and only friend, {{and one of his}} contemporaries. Hummel, who had heard of Beethoven's illness, came to him with succor and money. But it was too late; Beethoven was speechless, and a grateful smile was all that he had to bestow upon his friend. Hummel bent toward him, and, by the aid of an acoustic instrument, enabled Beethoven to hear a few words of his compassion and regret. Beethoven seemed reanimated, his eyes shone, he struggled for utterance, and gasped, [...] "Is it not true, Hummel, that I have some talent after all?". After these words, his <b>eyes</b> <b>grew</b> fixed, his mouth fell open, and he passed away.|$|E

2500|$|Myopia {{has been}} {{increasing}} rapidly throughout the developed world, suggesting environmental factors must be important. [...] Quite similarly, the mechanisms of emmetropization are still unclear. [...] Emmetropization is {{the process by which}} a child's <b>eye</b> <b>grows</b> and changes to become less hyperopic.
