50|$|This {{documentary}} about the teachers and students of The American Ballet Theatre School focuses primarily on three aspiring dancers: Teenaged Janis Roswick, Daniel Giagni, who adores her and the irresponsible David Prince. Throughout the film, Janis reads aloud from her diary, disclosing her intention to add beauty {{to the world and}} become a better person through dance, and describes her preparation to lose her innocence. Janis is frequently seen walking with Daniel and another dancer, Andrei Kulyk, who flirts with her. When Daniel confides in Andrei about the shyness which keeps him from declaring his feelings for Janis, Andrei advises him to sublimate his feelings to his art. Daniel’s life outside of school, as he drills and trains to be a typist with the New York National Guard, is contrasted with his rehearsals of a scene from Petrouchka, in which he evokes unrequited love as Janis watches. Daniel comes close to initiating a romantic moment with Janis in her apartment when he tries to take her hand, but when she is not responsive, he soon leaves. David is first seen in his apartment, telling fellow student Marlese Rockey of his ambivalence about becoming a dancer and complaining that Leon Danielian, the school’s director, characterizes him as conniving. Following this, David is seen in Danielian’s office, where the director remarks on the boy’s improved attitude and cautions him that it must continue or he will be dismissed from school. David is later seen during a visit with his mother, who tries to convince him to return home to Florida. In a segment titled, “acceptance,” after having sex with Marlese, David announces that he might soon leave New York and later, in a segment called “betrayal,” Marlese characterizes her affair with him as “time wasted on something that didn’t exist.” <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>segment,</b> David is seen back on a Florida beach, discussing Marlese, his feelings about his lost dance career and his current employment as a supermarket bagger. In segments throughout the film, costumed dancers perform excerpts from the ballet Petrouchka. Teachers Valentina Pereyaslavec and Michael Maule are seen instructing classes as is Danielian. Confined to a wheelchair throughout most of the film, Danielian discusses his ongoing treatments for arthritis, and sepia-toned footage of a young Danielian dancing in Paris is shown. Later, after an operation restores his mobility, Danielian walks into class where he is applauded by his students. Rudolph Nureyev is seen briefly in practice at the studio and Julie Newmar discusses the life of a dancer and talks to Maule about his short film career. The film ends with a long session in which Janis and Daniel perform a romantic, tender dance together, followed by still photographs of students as Pereyaslavec’s voice is heard instructing a class.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and {{validate}} an endoscopic index for assessing the severity of Crohn's disease. Endoscopic findings were prospectively collected by a multicentre group in 75 patients with Crohn's colitis according to a previously validated procedure. The presence of nine preselected lesions was recorded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>segments</b> (1) rectum, (2) sigmoid and left colon, (3) transverse colon, (4) right colon, and (5) ileum. <b>In</b> addition <b>the</b> extent of the diseased and ulcerated areas were estimated in each segment. These segmental data were recorded on a standard form, together with the endoscopist's global estimate of lesion severity. A stepwise multiple regression was used to derive an index which was correlated with the endoscopist's global evaluation of lesion severity. Four mucosal lesions: deep and superficial ulcerations, ulcerated and non-ulcerated stenosis, and both estimates of extent involved were selected and weighted to obtain a Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity which correlated with the endoscopist's global appraisal of lesion severity (r = 0. 83). This index was then prospectively shown to be valid in a further series of 113 colonoscopies (r = 0. 81). The index was calculated in 54 patients with active Crohn's disease, before and at the end of a course of corticosteroids: index variations correctly reflected changes in colitis severity as evaluated by the endoscopists (r = 0. 72).

40|$|I {{investigate}} the phonetic realization of syllable structure in Chicano English (=ChE) to characterize {{its status as}} a language contact dialect, its relation to the target language, and the changes it undergoes. I study two simplification processes, one consonantal and one vocalic, in the vernacular of a balanced sample of forty-five adult Chicanos (=Mexican-Americans), non-native and native speakers, across five generations using methods of empirical linguistics. A well-studied sociolinguistic variable, /-t,d/ deletion, serves to linguistically situate ChE {{in the absence of a}} description of the matrix dialect. When compared to a cross-dialectal characterization of the variable, I find differences in ChE. I discover no cross-generational changes, or convergence in the constraints of /-t,d/ deletion (including non-native speaking immigrants); although one morphological change is attributed to differences in language use of two age-groups. Increased deletion is correlated both with: greater sonority in the preceding segment; and lower sonority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>segment.</b> I attribute the latter findings to specific aspects of English syllable structure. The less-studied variable, in sociolinguistic terms, is unstressed vowel reduction. Spanish, the substrate, has no vowel reduction while English does, so I investigate how ChE develops vowel reduction. Formant frequency measurements are made of stressed and unstressed vowels for four speakers. I find that Euro-American vowel reduction is not 2 ̆ 7 acquired 2 ̆ 7 by ChE native speakers. Neither generation, language use at home, bilingualism versus monolingualism, or any linguistic factor plays a developmental role. Rather, a distinctive ChE pattern is found: mid vowels reduce while mid vowels do not reduce. When a fifth speaker is considered, a regular progression is tentatively suggested: vowel reduction develops in proportion to the amount of exposure to matrix dialect speakers. ^ I did not consistently find native speaker resolution of interference-type confusions in speech of the non-native speaker. The dialect 2 ̆ 7 s distinctive constraints on the simplification processes are shared by non-native and monolingual native speakers alike; generation is not significant. In a sense, the contact dialect establishes its characteristics before it has native speakers.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Gamma-glutamyl {{transpeptidase}} (GGT) is {{an enzyme}} believed {{to play a}} role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> protection of maturing spermatozoa <b>in</b> <b>the</b> epididymis. Our previous studies have shown that four GGT mRNA 5 (l-IV) transcribed from the single-copy rat GGT gene are differentially expressed and regulated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rat epididymis. <b>In</b> particular, <b>the</b> normal expression of GGT mRNA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> epididymal initial segment is dependent upon the presence of testicular factors. The objective {{of this study was to}} test the hypothesis that the decreased expression of GOT mRNA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>segment</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>in</b> vivo removal of testicular factors by efferent duct ligation (EDL) is due to a decrease in stability and/or transcription rate. The stability of the GGT mRNA 5 was evaluated by measuring the rate of mRNA decay. These stability studies showed that GGT mRNA exhibited a rapid initial decay that slowed at later times to a decay rate similar to that of GGT m-RNAs. The decay rates were not different following sham-operation or EDL, and thus the stability of GOT mRNA 5 were not influenced by <b>the</b> <b>in</b> vivo loss of testicular factors. Results of transcription analysis revealed that the transcription rate of GGT mRNA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initial segment fell by approximately 68 % following a 12 -hour EDL. Additionally, secondary-structure models indicate two families of folding patterns for GGT mRNA, which could be the reason for the two decay regimes detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stability study. Thus, the decreased expression level of GGT mRNA 1 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>segment</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>in</b> vivo loss of testicular factors is a function of a decreased transcription rate and intricate decay kinetics.

This programmable optic device has the properties of high packing density, low loss, easy fabrication, and virtually infinite bandwidth. The device is inherently two dimensional and has a packing density exceeding 25 lines/cm 2. The delay resolution of the device is on the order of a femtosecond (one micron <b>in</b> space) and <b>the</b> total delay exceeds 10 nanosecond. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> delay is reversible so that the same delay device can be used for both antenna transmitting and receiving...|$|R
5000|$|WTWO aired a one-minute promo on 2006 that criticized WTHI's weather coverage, {{claiming}} that WTHI's Doppler radar system was inferior to WTWO's {{because it was}} located within downtown Terre Haute, resulting in a [...] "dead zone" [...] - the area within the radius of the radar dome where reflectivity cannot be detected - over the city proper, stating that the WTWO radar's [...] "dead zone" [...] was positioned over a corn field and claimed that the combined experience of WTWO's weather staff {{was more than that}} of WTHI's staff; it also stated that WTHI's power had multiple points of failure in contrast to WTWO's.

Despite years of record-breaking economic growth that have made China the second or third largest economy on earth, the impact of what He Qinglian describes as the "marketization of power" and unbridled rent seeking by power holders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state apparatus has created one of the most economically divided societies on earth. With a Gini coefficient that measures the {{gap between rich and poor}} as high as perhaps 0. 59 (in most industrial countries it ranges between 0. 3 and 0. 4), China is rapidly becoming a society riven by class divisions, with consequences for social stability that only Karl Marx (and perhaps Mao Zedong) could appreciate. >sup> 1 >/sup> As <b>the</b> nouveau riche <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coastal areas while away their time, playing cards, engaging prostitutes, and purchasing mansions stocked with gold-plated furnishings, China's growing numbers of urban poor are finding it increasingly difficult to sustain even the most basic living standard. Laid off by bankrupt state-run enterprises that can afford to pay neither salaries nor health and pension benefits, China's new poor confront a desperate situation. This is especially true in interior cities, such as Shenyang, Liaoning province, where the benefits of "opening up to the outside world" are few and far between. Although the Chinese government has responded to the new phenomenon of un- and underemployment by experimenting with systems of social security and unemployment insurance common in advanced industrial nations, the impact of these rudimentary efforts, the author argues, has been marginal at best. Only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> relatively wealthy coastal areas, such as the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, can the local government afford such endeavors. ...|$|R

Sestava cikloheksana iz procesa, namenjenega za regeneracijo, je cca 80 % cikloheksana, 19 % THF, ostanejo še metanol, toluen in aceton. Pri prvi stopnji regeneracije povratnega cikloheksana dobimo 1000 L predtoka in cca 1500 - 2000 L regeneriranega povratnega cikloheksana. Sestava: predtok: cikloheksan, THF, metanol, aceton. (45, 15 % cikloheksan, 53, 07 % THF, 0, 89 % metanol, 0, 89 % aceton) regeneriran povratni cikloheksan: (99 % cikloheksana, ostalo THF in nekaj malega toluena) Cilj načrtovanih raziskav je bila eksperimentalna določitev procesnih parametrov, s katerimi bi iz predtoka s pomočjo rektifikacije pridobili še preostali cikloheksan. Topilo bi vračali nazaj v sintezo zdravila kot povratni cikloheksan skupaj s povratnim cikloheksanom iz prve stopnje regeneracije. V sklopu diplomskega dela smo podrobno raziskali sledeče segmente: •	Določili smo procesne parametre šaržne rektifikacije predtoka. •	Določili smo procesne parametre kontinuirne rektifikacije predtoka. •	Na podlagi rezultatov obeh rektifikacij smo preučili možnost za celotno regeneracijo povratnega cikloheksana s pomočjo kontinuirne rektifikacije. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{synthesis}} of medicines cyclohexane {{is used as}} a solvent.

The project foundation {{was laid out}} at the Visual Arts Program at MIT, employing Wavefront's Advanced Visualizer on a Silicon Graphics personal IRIS. The VR work was done at the Hitlab (University of Washington) using VPL's Virtualization interface and its Body Electric software running on the IRIS. Angels is a real-time interactive immersive movie, a kind of travel in a virtual paradise. The participant uses a VPL Dataglove and high-resolution HRX goggles developed by Jaron Lanier. Following Tom Furness' theory, the artwork was developed for the three senses: vision, audio and touch, though the technological restraints at the time could only implement vision, audio, and a non tactile data glove. Each user starts his/her experience {{in front of an}} odd carousel that is a passage to more VR worlds. Touching one of the three angels’ hearts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> carousel, defines <b>the</b> range <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>following</b> three <b>segments</b> will appear. The duration of the sections varies from just about 30" [...] to 2'30". The brilliantly colourful environments are a gateway to more scenes. The angels' voices ask the users to interact with them, causing a story to open. The music was composed by Diane Thome.While at MIT, Stenger also contributed to the seminal Cyberspace First Steps edited by Michael L. Benedikt with the now famous essay [...] "Mind is a Leaking Rainbow".|$|R
40|$|As a {{non-hazardous}} and non-invasive {{approach to}} medical diagnostic imaging, ultrasound {{serves as an}} ideal candidate for tracking and monitoring pregnancy development. One critical assessment during the first trimester of the pregnancy is the size measurements of the Gestation Sac (GS) and the Yolk Sac (YS) from ultrasound images. Such measurements tend to give a strong indication on {{the viability of the}} pregnancy. This paper proposes a novel multi-level trainable segmentation method to achieve three objectives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> order: (1) <b>segmenting</b> and measuring the GS, (2) automatically identifying the stage of pregnancy, and (3) segmenting and measuring the YS. The first level segmentation employs a trainable segmentation technique based on the histogram of oriented gradients to segment the GS and estimate its size. This is then followed by an automatic identification of the pregnancy stage based on histogram analysis of the content of the segmented GS. The second level segmentation is used after that to detect the YS and extract its relevant size measurements. A trained neural network classifier is employed to perform the segmentation at both levels. The effectiveness of the proposed solution has been evaluated by comparing the automatic size measurements of the GS and YS against the ones obtained gynaecologist. Experimental results on 199 ultrasound images demonstrate the effectiveness of <b>the</b> proposal <b>in</b> producing accurate measurements as well as identifying the correct stage of pregnancy...|$|R
