In 2010 Hyderabadi haleem was awarded <b>Geographical</b> <b>Indication</b> status by the Indian GI registry office.

Though Hyderabadi haleem is the traditional hors d'oeuvre at weddings, celebrations and other social occasions, it is particularly consumed in the Islamic month of Ramadan during Iftar (the evening meal that breaks the day-long fast) as it provides instant energy and is high in calories. This has made the dish synonymous with Ramadan. In recognition of its cultural significance and popularity, in 2010, it was granted <b>Geographical</b> <b>Indication</b> status (GIS) by the Indian GIS registry office, making it the first non-vegetarian dish in India to get this status.|$|E

5|$|Arbroath smokies, {{for which}} Arbroath is {{well-known}} nationally and internationally, are made solely in Arbroath following the award of Protected <b>Geographical</b> <b>Indication</b> in 2004, which limits Arbroath smokie production to within 4km of Arbroath. Smokies {{are made from}} haddock using traditional methods {{dating back to the}} late 19th century where the fish are first salted overnight to preserve them, before being left tied in pairs to dry. Next, the dried fish are hung in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire and covered with a lid. After around an hour of smoking, the fish are golden brown and ready to eat. The preparation of smokies remains a cottage industry in Arbroath, centred almost exclusively at the harbour area. However, one larger processor, RR Spink, supplied Arbroath smokies to several UK supermarket chains. It appears that, nowadays, the firm concentrates on smoking other fish such as salmon or trout and no longer supplies the Arbroath Smokie. The company holds the Royal Warrant as a fishmonger to the Queen.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this thesis is to determine how Uganda can optimally benefit from <b>geographical</b> <b>indications.</b> This objective is achieved {{by focusing on the}} current negotiations at the World Trade Organization concerning <b>geographical</b> <b>indications.</b> The main issues in contention are the extension of a higher level of protection to other products, besides wines and spirits, and the establishment of a multilateral register for wines and spirits. In the discussion of these issues, each proposal is examined in light of Uganda's interests. The thesis also focuses on how <b>geographical</b> <b>indications</b> can be turned into development tools at the national level. It considers Uganda's legislation, the <b>Geographical</b> <b>Indications</b> Act 8 of 2013, and highlights the provisions that might deter the establishment of a successful <b>geographical</b> <b>indications</b> system in the country. The thesis then identifies other factors that Uganda must address in order for <b>geographical</b> <b>indications</b> to become development tools. It is concluded that in order to establish a successful <b>geographical</b> <b>indications</b> system, Uganda needs to continue its support for the Modalities Proposal in the international negotiations. Furthermore, at the national level, there are various factors that must be addressed, beyond the law, before <b>geographical</b> <b>indications</b> can become development tools, and these include the formation of producer organisations, marketing strategies and the sensitisation of stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|Both {{trademarks}} and <b>geographical</b> <b>indications</b> {{are legal}} devices which regulate communication to markets about a product. Trademarks indicate the commercial origin {{of a good}} or service while <b>geographical</b> <b>indications</b> signal the geographic origin. Both tools also legally grant exclusive rights to certain uses of a word or symbol. Tension arises when the tools overlap on the same subject matter. The thesis asks: is coexistence between the devices in the TRIPS Agreement possible? Are the concepts of trademarks and <b>geographical</b> <b>indications</b> related? If so, how? If not, how? Does the marketing literature of business recognize both registered trademarks and <b>geographical</b> <b>indications</b> as aspects of the same branding exercise? The thesis finds that as trademarks and <b>geographical</b> <b>indications</b> are unique devices that are not interchangeable {{and it is possible}} for legislation to simultaneously protect both, trademarks and <b>geographical</b> <b>indications</b> are therefore not in conflict and can instead be viewed as harmonious tools...|$|R
40|$|<b>Geographical</b> <b>indications</b> {{designate}} products {{which have}} a specific geographical origin, which can either be national, regional or local. The subject is complicated since <b>geographical</b> <b>indications</b> arises {{a large number of}} questions There are EC regulations which regulate the protection of <b>geographical</b> <b>indications,</b> but since the field has not yet been exhaustively harmonized, the existence of national rules of protection is therefore still possible, which can lead to trade barriers between the member states. Consequently, one problem consists in whether it may be legitimate to restrict the free movement of goods by article 28 in the EC Treaty by referring to national rules of protection and to what extent such measures may be justified by article 30 or by the Cassis doctrine. An additional question consists in how the line between <b>geographical</b> <b>indications</b> and generic terms is to be established appropriately. Further, <b>geographical</b> <b>indications</b> are exposed to improper use by other dishonest commercial operators and therefore the possibilities of protection against unfair competition and misleading are also discussed in the thesis. Since there are several questions which are unanswered regarding <b>geographical</b> <b>indications,</b> the purpose of this essay is to analyze what kind of intellectual property right <b>geographical</b> <b>indications</b> constitute and how they are protected...|$|R
