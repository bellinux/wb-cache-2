40|$|In {{a series}} of papers {{researchers}} at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) have reported measurements of the time to <b>explosion</b> in <b>spheres</b> of various high explosives following a rapid, uniform increase in the surface temperature of the sphere. Due to the spherical symmetry, the time-dependent properties of the explosive (temperature, chemical composition, etc.) are functions of the radial spatial coordinate only; thus the name one-dimensional time-to-explosion (ODTX). The LLNL researchers also report an evolving series of computational modeling results for the ODTX experiments, culminating in those obtained using a sophisticated heat transfer code incorporating accurate descriptions of chemical reaction. Although the chemical reaction mechanism used to describe HMX decomposition is quite simple, the computational results agree very well with the experimental data. In addition to reproducing the magnitude and temperature dependence of the measured times to explosion, the computational results also agree {{with the results of}} post reaction visual inspection. The ODTX experiments offer a near-ideal example of a transport process (heat transfer in this case) tightly coupled with chemical reaction. The LLNL computational model clearly captures the important features of the ODTX experiments. An obvious question of interest is to what extent the model and/or its individual components (specifically the chemical reaction mechanism) are applicable to other experimental scenarios. Valid exploration of this question requires accurate understanding of (1) the experimental scenario addressed by the LLNL model and (2) details of the application of the model.

40|$|AbstractThe {{parameters}} of explosive {{characteristics of the}} coal-dust are assessed systematically with the test device of minimum ignition temperature of dust clouds and 20 L <b>sphere</b> <b>explosion</b> test units. The minimum ignition temperature of dust is a main safety index when handling combustible dusts in industrial production, and while hazard evaluation, the maximum explosion pressure and the explosion index are key parameters. Five kinds of coal-dust with different particle diameters were tested {{in order to determine}} the temperature sensitivity and the ferocity under the given conditions, which can be used as the criteria to classify dust explosion hazards. The experiment results indicate that the minimum ignition temperature of coal-dust cloud reduces with the decrease of particle diameter under temperature of (293 ± 5) K and powder spraying pressure of 0. 08 MPa, and when the particle size reduces to (25 - 48) μm, the minimum ignition temperature is between (793 - 803) K; Besides that, the results can also show that minimum explosive concentration of coal-dust cloud is between 20 gám- 3 and 30 gám- 3 under temperature of (293 ± 5) K, powder spraying pressure of 2 MPa and ignition energy of 10 kJ, the maximum explosion pressure is 0. 45 MPa and the maximum explosion index is 11. 14 MPaámás- 1, which classifies coal-dust explosion hazards to Level I. The conclusions drawn from the experimental results are of great significance to the safe application of these combustible substances...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to {{demonstrate}} the particular aspects of the explosion of hybrid mixtures with respect to either vapour or dust explosions. This work is focused on pharmaceutical products from excipients to active drug substances and their associated solvents. Experiments with an <b>explosion</b> <b>sphere</b> {{has been used to}} determined the influence of dusts and vapours concentrations on the severity of explosions (maximum pressure Pmax and maximum rate of pressure rise (dP/dt) max). Results clearly show that the explosion behaviour of such hybrid mixtures reveals significant differences with respect to either vapour or dust explosions; especially a promotion effect on the combustion kinetics and on the rate of pressure rise for poor mixtures. The influences of the introduction of small amount of vapour on the minimum explosible dust concentration (MEC) and of dust addition on the lower explosion limit (LEL) are noteworthy...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out on the influences of dust concentration, particle size distribution and humidity on aluminum dust explosion. Tests were mainly conducted thanks to a 20 L <b>explosion</b> <b>sphere.</b> The effect of humidity was studied by storing the aluminum particles at constant relative humidity until the sorption equilibrium or by introducing water vapour in the explosion vessel. The tested particles sizes ranged from a volume median diameter of 7 to 42 μm and the dust concentrations were up to 3000 g m− 3. Among other results, the strong influence of the particle size was pointed out, especially when the Sauter mean diameter is considered. These results stressed the predominance of the specific surface area on the mass median particle diameter. The effect of water on aluminum dust explosion was decoupled: on the one hand, when water adsorption occurs, hydrogen generation leads to an increase of the explosion severity; on the other hand, when the explosion of dried aluminum powder occurs in a humid atmosphere, the inhibiting effect of humidity is put forward. A model based on mass and heat balances, assuming a shrinking core model with chemical reaction limitation, leads to a satisfactory representation of the pressure evolution during the dust explosion...|$|E

50|$|Blast {{injuries}} {{can result}} from various types of incidents ranging from industrial accidents to terrorist attacks. High-order explosives produce a supersonic overpressure shock wave, while low order explosives deflagrate and do not produce an overpressure wave. A blast wave generated by an explosion starts with a single pulse of increased air pressure, lasting a few milliseconds. The negative pressure (suction) of the blast wave follows immediately after the positive wave. The duration of the blast wave depends {{on the type of}} explosive material and the distance from the point of detonation. The blast wave progresses from the source of <b>explosion</b> as a <b>sphere</b> of compressed and rapidly expanding gases, which displaces an equal volume of air at a very high velocity. The velocity of the blast wave in air may be extremely high, depending on the type and amount of the explosive used. An individual in the path of an explosion will be subjected not only to excess barometric pressure, but to pressure from the high-velocity wind traveling directly behind the shock front of the blast wave. The magnitude of damage due to the blast wave is dependent on the peak of the initial positive pressure wave, the duration of the overpressure, the medium in which it explodes, the distance from the incident blast wave, and the degree of focusing due to a confined area or walls. For example, explosions near or within hard solid surfaces become amplified two to nine times due to shock wave reflection. As a result, individuals between the blast and a building generally suffer two to three times the degree of injury compared to those in open spaces.|$|R

40|$|Because of {{concerns}} for the effect that chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) fluids currently in use as refrigerants have on the environment, the refrigeration industry is considering the use of natural refrigerants, {{many of which are}} potentially flammable. In some cases, these flammable fluids may result in the least environmental damage when considering ozone depletion, global warming, efficiency, and photochemical reactivity. Many potentially flammable fluids have been proven to be effective when used either by themselves or {{as a part of a}} binary or ternary mixture. However, despite favorable initial test results, these fluids may not be acceptable to the general public if questions of safety cannot be adequately addressed. Significant research is being conducted to investigate the flammability of these materials. The purpose of this project is to experimentally determine the impact and variability of eleven different parameters which may affect flammability and/or combustibility of refrigerants and refrigerant blends, as a function of composition and test conditions, and to develop a better understanding of methods and conditions to measure the flammability of refrigerants. The refrigerants used in this study are being considered as new refrigerants and reviewed published data on these materials is scarce. The data contained herein should not be considered complete and should be used only to make relative comparisons of the impacts of the test parameters, not to represent the flammability characteristics of the materials. This report documents Task 3 of the test program. During Task 1, technical literature was thoroughly reviewed and a database of available documents was constructed. During Task 2, the test plan for this task was written. The goals of Task 3 are to investigate the flammability characteristics of selected blends of refrigerants R 32, R 134 a, and R 125 using an existing <b>explosion</b> <b>sphere</b> and a newly-constructed ASTM E 681 apparatus...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIgnition and {{explosion}} {{characteristics of}} combustible dusts are mainly under {{the dependence of}} two kind of parameters: the physico-chemical properties of the powder and the parameters affecting the process. Within these latest parameters, turbulence has {{a great impact on}} both dispersion level of the dust and flame propagation. In addition, turbulence end to affect agglomeration level of the dust, which have both an impact on the dispersion level and on the ignition and explosion characteristics which are measured in standard apparatus such as the Modified Hartmann tube (MikeIII) for ignition sensitivity or 20 L sphere for explosion severity. Until recently, based on previous studies carried out in the 70 's, it was thought that flammability risks were decreasing as the agglomerates sizes were lowered. If this observation seemed available for microsized powders, it was however shown by Trunov, in the case of aluminum nanoparticles that agglomeration could make ignition easier than for deagglomerated nanoparticles. This effect seems to be mainly due to local self-heating of the agglomerates. Agglomeration plays then a major role on the reliability of safety characteristics measurements and its impacts on ignition and explosion severity needs therefore to be thoroughly understood. In that context, we carried out a CFD study in order to better assess phenomena pertaining to the agglomeration and fragmentation of particles dispersed by a standard apparatus in a Mike II apparatus. This preliminary analysis was focused on the characterization of biphasic turbulent flows within a modified Hartmann tube (Mike III) in order to study the interdependence between agglomerate and flow conditions. Due to the apparent worsening effects of nanoagglomerates, this study focused mainly on sub-micronic particles in order to catch relevant phenomena from an industrial safety perspective. In the near future, the relevance of the dispersion system of the 20 L <b>explosion</b> <b>sphere</b> will be assessed as well following a similar methodology in order to analyze the level of confidence of explosion characteristics measurements of agglomerated nanopowders...|$|E
