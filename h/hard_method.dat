50|$|The <b>hard</b> <b>method</b> is {{characterized}} by the direct application of counter-force to an opposing force. In practice, this may be a direct attack, consisting of movement directly towards the opponent, coinciding with a strike towards the opponent. A defensive technique where the defender stands their ground to block or parry (directly opposing the attack by stopping it or knocking it aside) would be an example of a <b>hard</b> <b>method</b> of defense. <b>Hard</b> <b>method</b> techniques are generally conceptualized as being linear.|$|E

50|$|The {{shooting}} {{percentage is}} lower in fadeway (because {{of the difficulty}} of the shot) and the shooter cannot get his own rebound. This leads many coaches and players to believe {{it is one of the}} worst shots in the game to take. However, once mastered, it is one of the <b>hardest</b> <b>methods</b> of shooting for defenders to block. The threat of a fadeaway forces a defender to jump into the shooter, and with a pump fake, the shooter can easily get a foul on the defender.|$|R

Soft and <b>hard</b> <b>methods</b> for interference cance-lation are presented, which play a critical role for all MIMO relays whether they are full-duplex or half-duplex, regenera-tive or non-regenerative, one-way relay or two-way relay. A perspective of MIMO relays in a network of many hops is illustrated. A distinction is made between feedback loop of energy and feedback loop of noise. Subspace computation and a generalized water-filling (GWF) algorithm are shown as important building blocks for the design. 1...|$|R

The case study puts stress not only on <b>hard</b> <b>methods</b> (such as ex ante conditionality), but also on soft forms of influence (e. g. socialisation or persuasion). The Commission's tools were sorted according to Frank Schimmelfennig and Ulrich Sedelmeier's typology: 1) External-Incentive-Model; 2) Social-Learning- Model and 3) Lesson-Drawing-Model. The thesis combines two methodological approaches - process tracing and discursive analysis of relevant Czech actors.

Study wavelet’s new theory, new method and new application have important theoretical significance and practical value.

Simulation experiments show that the proposed soft, hard threshold tradeoff based signal threshold improved deniosing method shows a strong effect of the practical signal denoising, the obtained reconstructed signal SNR has been tremendously improved than the traditional denoising method...|$|R

40|$|This work {{modelled}} {{the spatial}} distribution of the rodent species that act as hosts in the transmission cycle of the parasitic tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. The rodent distribution was modelled in relation to landscape characteristics in four ways, using (1) a Landsat ETM+ derived hard classification, (2) single-image Landsat ETM+ derived NDVI, (3) single-image MODIS 16 -day composite NDVI, and (4) time-series MODIS 16 -day composite NDVI imagery. The MODIS time-series imagery produced the strongest relationships and explained the highest percentage deviance of the relationships present (up to 41. 4 %), whereas the <b>hard</b> classification <b>method</b> only explained up to 21. 2 % of deviance. Single-image NDVI datasets produced poor results, with Landsat ETM+ derived NDVI explaining only up to 11. 9 % of deviance, and MODIS derived NDVI up to only 8. 78 %. These results confirm that using time-series NDVI data to model rodent distributions is a valid method, and can offer improved results over single date NDVI and <b>hard</b> classification <b>methods.</b> 1...|$|R
