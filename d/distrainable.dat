The cloak was a more important piece of clothing used both for warmth during the day and as a blanket during the night. In the sometimes quite cold climate of the region, a cloak was a necessity for survival. Jewish law thus states that one's cloak is not <b>distrainable,</b> it cannot be lost in a lawsuit or seized to pay debts because of its importance. This rule is laid out in Exodus 22:25-26. Nolland notes that the end result of such a policy would be nudity, which Jesus never condemns, but which was also something unacceptable to the society of the time.|$|E

To solve this problem, we propose to substitute visual words by visual phrases in this article. Visual phrases built according to spatial relations between words are semantic <b>distrainable,</b> and they can improve the accuracy of Bag of Words model. Considering the traditional classification method based on Bag of Words model is vulnerable to the background, block and scalar variance of an image, we propose in this article a multiple visual words learning method for image classification, {{which is based on}} the concept of visual phrases combined with Multiple Instance Learning. The final classification model is able to show the spatial features of image classes. Experiments performed on standard image testing sets, Caltech 101 and Scene 15, show the satisfying performance of this algorithm...|$|E
