25|$|Potassium–argon dating, {{abbreviated}} K–Ar dating, is a radiometric dating {{method used}} in geochronology and archaeology. It {{is based on}} measurement of {{the product of the}} radioactive decay of an isotope of potassium (K) into argon (Ar). Potassium is a common element found in many materials, such as micas, clay minerals, tephra, and evaporites. In these materials, the decay product 40Ar is able to escape the liquid (molten) rock, but starts to accumulate when the rock solidifies (recrystallizes). The amount of Argon sublimation that occurs {{is a function of the}} purity of the sample, the composition of the mother material, and a number of other factors. These factors introduce error limits on the upper and lower bounds of dating, so that final <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> is reliant on the environmental factors during formation, melting, and exposure to decreased pressure and/or open-air. Time since recrystallization is calculated by measuring the ratio of the amount of 40Ar accumulated to the amount of 40K remaining. The long half-life of 40K allows the method to be used to calculate the absolute age of samples older than a few thousand years.|$|E

50|$|As stars grow older, their {{luminosity}} increases at an appreciable rate. Given {{the mass}} of the star, one can use this rate of increase in luminosity {{in order to determine the}} age of the star. This method only works for calculating stellar age on the main sequence, because in advanced evolutionary stages of the star, such as the red giant stage, the standard relationship for the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> no longer holds. However, when one can observe a red giant star with a known mass, one can calculate the main-sequence lifetime, and thus the minimum age of star is known given that it is in an advanced stage of its evolution. As the star spends only about 1% of its total lifetime as a red giant, this is an accurate method of determining age.|$|E

50|$|The <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> in {{this species}} has proved {{difficult}} {{because there are}} small rings present on the scales called annuli.

The spaces between striae are often lighter in color especially in comparison to the rest of the striated region of the scale. In comparison, salmon and trout form much more distinct annuli according to rings forming closer to one another during different seasons of the year. In essence, the debate is whether these annuli are spawning rings or whether they develop as a result of some unknown cause and unknown time frame.

40|$|ABSTRACT.

Radiocarbon is a powerful tool that can potentially help the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>ages</b> and growth rates of these plants. However, the application of 14 C analyses has one important problem for trees without annual rings and palms: the calibration of 14 C measurements with common programs such as CALIBomb or OxCal gives erroneous determinations for wood formed between AD 1954 and 1964. This problem is illustrated here using samples from a tropical tree (Otoba gracilipes) and a tropical palm (Oenocarpus bataua).

5000|$|During the 1960s Kerley {{developed}} what is {{now known}} {{in the field of}} Foresic anthropology as the [...] "Kerley Method". This method examines thin cross sections of human remains, specifically long bones such as the femur and humerus and investigates areas of altered bone. As a human skeleton grows and matures during a lifetime, a condition similar to osteoporosis occurs naturally. Cells replacing decaying bone matter actually eat away at existing bone, creating fragments which increase with age. Counting the number of these fragments in a cross section shows a corresponding increase of the fragments with an increase {{in the age of the}} person. The bone replacement ceases upon a persons death. Kerley's published work on the matter in 1965, was based on the study of 126 specimens whose ages were already known by the Smithsonian Institution. In all but 11 specimens, the Kerley Method identified the remains within a margin of plus or minus 4.6 years. The subjects studied by Kerley ranged in age from 5 to 95. By the 1970s, the method was considered a standard in the field of Forensic anthropology for <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> and over 40 age determinations had been made, to even badly burned and disfigured remains with similar results.|$|E
