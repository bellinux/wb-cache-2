5|$|The duty officer, Captain Thomas Selvester, began {{a routine}} interrogation. Himmler {{admitted}} who he was, and Selvester had the prisoner searched. Himmler {{was taken to}} the headquarters of the Second British Army in Lüneburg, where Doctor Wells conducted a medical exam on him. The doctor attempted to examine the inside of Himmler's mouth, but the prisoner was reluctant to open it and <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> head away. Himmler then bit into a hidden cyanide pill and collapsed onto the floor. He was dead within 15 minutes. Shortly afterward, Himmler's body was buried in an unmarked grave near Lüneburg. The grave's location remains unknown.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} {{around this time}} in Forth Worth when Short did one of his amazing acts of marksmanship.

25|$|Reid {{grabbed the}} rifle barrel {{with his left}} hand and pressed it down, and with his right he drew his {{revolver}} (if not already drawn) and pointed it at Smith.

Reid tried to shoot again as Smith <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> rifle from Reid’s desperate grasp and quickly moved it in the direction of Reid.|$|E

500|$|Coleridge's barrister, John Lawson Walton, called Lind af Hageby and Schartau. They {{repeated}} {{they had}} been the first students to arrive and had been left alone with the dog for about two minutes. They had observed scars from the previous operations and an incision in the neck where two tubes had been placed. They had not smelled the anaesthetic and had not seen any apparatus delivering it. They said, Mason wrote, that the dog had arched his back and <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> legs in what they regarded as an effort to escape. When the experiment began the dog continued to [...] "upheave its abdomen" [...] and tremble, they said, movements they regarded as [...] "violent and purposeful".|$|E
500|$|At 3:20p.m., the {{screwdriver}} {{slipped and}} the upper beryllium hemisphere fell, causing a [...] "prompt critical" [...] reaction and a burst of hard radiation. At the time, the scientists in the room observed the blue glow of air ionization and felt a heat wave. Slotin experienced a sour taste {{in his mouth and}} an intense burning sensation in his left hand. He <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> left hand upward, lifting the upper beryllium hemisphere and dropping it to the floor, ending the reaction. However, he had already been exposed to a lethal dose of neutron radiation. At the time of the accident, dosimetry badges were in a locked box about [...] from the accident. Realizing {{that no one in the}} room had their film badges on, [...] "immediately after the accident Dr. Slotin asked to have the badges taken from the lead box and placed on the critical assembly". This peculiar response was attributed to [...] "vertigo" [...] and was of no value for determining the actual doses received by the men in the room.|$|E
