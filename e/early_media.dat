Although these claims were later proven to be false, speculation in national media and among the public continued to blame Manson's music and imagery for inciting Harris and Klebold. Later reports revealed that the two were not fans—and, in fact, had disliked the band's music. Despite this, Marilyn Manson (as well as other bands and forms of entertainment, such as movies and video games) were widely criticized by religious, political, and entertainment-industry figures.|$|E

500|$|Oasis {{spent the}} end of 1996 and {{the first quarter of}} 1997 at Abbey Road Studios in London and Ridge Farm Studios in Surrey {{recording}} their third album. Quarrels between the Gallagher brothers plagued the recording sessions. Be Here Now was released in August 1997.

By {{the end of}} the first day of release, Be Here Now sold 424,000 units and by the end of business on Saturday of that week sales had reached 696,000, making it the fastest-selling album in British history. The album debuted at numbertwo on the Billboard 200 in the US, but its first week sales of 152,000—below expected sales of 400,000 copies—were considered a disappointment. Although <b>early</b> <b>media</b> reviews were positive, once the hype had died down, the album was criticised for being bloated and derivative with most of the critics focused on the extensive length of several songs, the heavier sound, and overproduction.|$|E

Finally, Spears addressed the situation according to BBC Online. She was quoted as saying, [...] "I hear {{there is a lot of}} controversy in the media about my show. Some reporters have said they love it and some don't. I came to Australia for my fans".

500|$|As the {{nominations}} for the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards approached, <b>early</b> <b>media</b> reports named True Detective among several potential miniseries candidates, {{due to a}} revision made by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences that recognized film and miniseries content as distinct categories. By March 2014, HBO had submitted True Detective as a drama series contender, an unconventional move given the show's anthology format and fierce competition {{from the likes of}} Breaking Bad and House of Cards. HBO's decision was censured by FX president John Landgraf, who remarked to reporters at a press event: [...] "My own personal point of view is that a miniseries is a story that ends, a series is a story that continues. To tell you the truth, I think it’s actually unfair for HBO to put True Detective in the drama series category because essentially you can get certain actors to do a closed-ended series – a la Billy Bob Thornton in Fargo or Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson in True Detective – who you can’t get to sign on for a seven-year [...] deal." [...] Nevertheless, True Detective emerged as a frontrunner heading into the Primetime Emmy season, and in July 2014, was nominated for twelve awards; its closest rival, Breaking Bad, received sixteen nominations. The series ultimately won five Emmy awards: Outstanding Directing (Fukunaga), Outstanding Casting, Outstanding Main Title Design, Outstanding Make-Up, and Outstanding Cinematography.|$|E
