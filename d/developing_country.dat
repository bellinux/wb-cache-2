5|$|Evaluating Mountfort's works today, one has {{to avoid}} judging them against a {{background}} of similar designs in Europe. In the 1860s, New Zealand was a <b>developing</b> <b>country,</b> where materials and resources freely available in Europe were conspicuous by their absence. When available they were often of inferior quality, as Mountfort discovered with the unseasoned wood in his first disastrous project. His first buildings in his new homeland were often too tall, or steeply pitched, failing to take account of the non-European climate and landscape. However, he soon adapted, and developed his skill in working with crude and unrefined materials.|$|E

5|$|Malaysia's {{unprecedented}} {{and recent}} rapid development has attracted millions of migrant workers from across Asia {{in the recent}} years. The majority of whom are undocumented, which the Malaysian government is struggling to combat. Its treatment and crackdown on migrant workers has often been criticised by international human rights watchdogs. Today, Malaysia has a newly industrialised market economy, ranked 4th largest in Southeast Asia and 38th largest in the world. With a GDP per capita of $9,766 and an HDI of 0.78 currently, Malaysia is classified as an emerging economy by the World Bank. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also classifies Malaysia as an emerging and <b>developing</b> <b>country.</b> It is {{a founding member of}} the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the East Asia Summit, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Malaysia is also a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the Non-Aligned Movement. In 2017, Malaysian citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 164 countries and territories, ranking the Malaysian passport 5th most powerful in the world.|$|E

However, the recent declining trend from <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> {{and the emergence of}} FDI from <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> at a huge amount have triggered our interest on the issue whether (or not) FDI from <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> are more risk averse than FDI from <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> This could imply that FDI from <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> could be contributing more towards economic development in host <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> Focusing on Malaysian manufacturing sector, this study attempts to identify the risk averseness of FDI from <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> against FDI from <b>developing</b> <b>countries...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) {{recommended}} that rotavirus vaccine {{be included in}} all national immunisation programmes. The incidence and severity of rotavirus infections has declined significantly in countries that have acted on this recommendation. A 2014 review of available clinical trial data from countries routinely using rotavirus vaccines in their national immunisation programs found that rotavirus vaccines have reduced rotavirus hospitalisations by 49-92 percent and all cause diarrhoea hospitalisations by 17-55 percent. In Mexico, which in 2006 {{was among the first}} countries in the world to introduce rotavirus vaccine, diarrhoeal disease death rates dropped during the 2009 rotavirus season by more than 65 percent among children age two and under. In Nicaragua, which in 2006 became the first <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> to introduce a rotavirus vaccine, severe rotavirus infections were reduced by 40 percent and emergency room visits by a half. In the United States, rotavirus vaccination since 2006 has led to drops in rotavirus-related hospitalisations by as much as 86 percent. The vaccines may also have prevented illness in non-vaccinated children by limiting the number of circulating infections. In developing countries in Africa and Asia, where the majority of rotavirus deaths occur, a large number of safety and efficacy trials as well as recent post-introduction impact and effectiveness studies of Rotarix and RotaTeq have found that vaccines dramatically reduced severe disease among infants. In September 2013, the vaccine was offered to all children in the UK, aged between two and three months, and it is expected to halve the cases of severe infection and reduce the number of children admitted to hospital because of the infection by 70 percent. In Europe, hospitalisation rates following infection by rotavirus have decreased by 65% to 84% following the introduction of the vaccine.|$|E

25|$|Under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) a {{developed}} country can 'sponsor' a greenhouse gas reduction project in a <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> where {{the cost of}} greenhouse gas reduction project activities is usually much lower, but the atmospheric effect is globally equivalent. The {{developed country}} would be given credits for meeting its emission reduction targets, while the <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> would receive the capital investment and clean technology or beneficial change in land use.|$|E
50|$|The {{economic}} {{basis for}} including <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> {{in efforts to}} reduce emissions is that emission cuts {{are thought to be}} less expensive in <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> than <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> (Goldemberg et al., 1996, p. 30; Grubb, 2003, p. 159). For example, in <b>developing</b> <b>countries,</b> environmental regulation is generally weaker than it is in <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> (Sathaye et al., 2001, p. 387-389). Thus, it is widely thought that there is greater potential for <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> to reduce their emissions than <b>developed</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|R

50|$|Usually <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> have a {{positive}} or high natural increase rate. <b>Developed</b> <b>countries</b> have a negative/neutral or low natural increase rate, but many <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> have their population increasing due to immigration despite their negative RNI. These countries also have the lower rate of death. This is because <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> and <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> are in different stages of the demographic transition. <b>Developing</b> <b>countries</b> are generally in the earlier stages of the transition meaning they have high fertility, which would show an increase in crude birth rates. <b>Developed</b> <b>countries</b> usually have lower or more stable fertility rates so they don't show as high rates in natural increase. This {{can be applied to}} mortality rates as well, because <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> generally have higher mortality rates than <b>developed</b> <b>countries.</b> High mortality rates are due to differences in deaths from chronic and acute diseases.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{estimates of}} both national and global welfare costs of bilateral quotas on textiles and apparel using an applied {{general equilibrium model}} which covers bilateral quotas on exports of textiles and apparel negotiated between three major <b>developed</b> importing <b>countries</b> (the US, Canada and the EEC) and 34 supplying <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> under {{the provisions of the}} Multifibre Arrangement applying in mid- 1980 s (MFA 111).

This suggests that despite foregone rent transfers, <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> would receive gains by eliminating the MFA. In the central variant analysis, all <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> gain by eliminating tariff and MFA restrictions because, contrary to popular belief, the <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> (including Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan) are relatively small compared to <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> even in apparel production.
