5|$|Dubstep is a {{genre of}} {{electronic}} dance music that originated in South London, England. It {{emerged in the}} late 1990s as a development within a lineage of related styles such as 2-step garage, dub, techno, <b>drum</b> <b>and</b> bass, broken beat, jungle, and reggae. In the United Kingdom {{the origins of the}} genre {{can be traced back to}} the growth of the Jamaican sound system party scene in the early 1980s. The music generally features sparse, syncopated <b>drum</b> <b>and</b> percussion patterns with bass lines that contain prominent sub bass frequencies.|$|E

5|$|Originally, dubstep {{releases}} {{had some}} structural {{similarities to other}} genres like <b>drum</b> <b>and</b> bass and UK garage. Typically this would comprise an intro, a main section (often incorporating a bass drop), a midsection, a second main section similar to the first (often with another drop), and an outro.|$|E

5|$|A distant, mournful fanfare (A), {{played on}} a cornet {{representing}} a bugle, {{is followed by a}} brisk military march initiated by a duet for side <b>drum</b> <b>and</b> piccolo (B). A passage for brass precedes the introduction of a theme or leitmotif associated with the phantom Kijé which, after a reprise of the march and a C major crescendo, is repeated on tenor saxophone, an instrument relatively new to the orchestra at that time. The cornet fanfare then returns to close the movement.|$|E
5|$|A non-safety fougasse {{could be}} built by simply burying the {{propelling}} charge behind the fuel <b>drum</b> <b>and</b> running leads through the soil. Instructions for several variants of this design were published but this construction increases the hazard because the leads {{would have to be}} left exposed on the surface and any electrical current applied could, theoretically, ignite the charge. Also, underground moisture could also easily ruin the charge {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E

5|$|Dominica's folk musical {{heritage}} includes work songs, storytelling, children's {{music and}} masquerade songs. Dominican work songs {{are accompanied by}} the tambou twavay <b>drum,</b> <b>and</b> are performed by workers while gathering fruit, building roads, fishing, moving a house or sawing wood. Many are responsorial, and are generally short and simple, with the lyrical text and rhythm tying into the work to be accompanied. On modern Dominica, work songs are rarely performed.|$|E
5|$|Jack White's {{voice is}} a singular, evocative {{combination}} of punk, metal, blues, and backwoods while his guitar work is grand and banging with just enough lyrical touches of slide and subtle solo work... Meg White balances out the fretwork and the fretting with methodical, spare, and booming cymbal, bass <b>drum,</b> <b>and</b> snare... All D.I.Y. punk-country-blues-metal singer-songwriting duos should sound this good.|$|E

A dam was built on Coire Dubh burn for hydroelectric purposes; the house was the first private home in Scotland, outside of Glasgow, to have an electricity supply.|$|E

5|$|London was {{instrumental}} in the development of punk music, with figures such as the Sex Pistols, The Clash, and Vivienne Westwood all based in the city. More recent artists to emerge from the London music scene include George Michael's Wham!, Kate Bush, Seal, the Pet Shop Boys, Bananarama, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bush, the Spice Girls, Jamiroquai, Blur, McFly, The Prodigy, Gorillaz, Bloc Party, Mumford & Sons, Coldplay, Amy Winehouse, Adele, Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran, Paloma Faith, Ellie Goulding, One Direction and Florence and the Machine.

Music station BBC Radio 1Xtra was set up to support the rise of local urban contemporary music both in London and {{in the rest of the}} United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Much like <b>drum</b> <b>and</b> bass before it, dubstep {{started to}} become {{incorporated}} into other media.

5|$|On Christmas Day 1957, Graves gave Starkey a {{second-hand}} drum kit {{consisting of}} a snare drum, bass <b>drum</b> <b>and</b> a makeshift cymbal fashioned from a rubbish bin lid.

5|$|The {{competition}} {{mission was}} then toughened {{and made a}} bit less abstract by requiring teams {{to search for a}} toxic waste dump, map the location of partially buried randomly oriented toxic waste drums, identify the contents of each drum from the hazard labels found somewhere on the outside of each <b>drum,</b> <b>and</b> bring a sample back from one of the drums—all without any human intervention whatsoever.|$|E
