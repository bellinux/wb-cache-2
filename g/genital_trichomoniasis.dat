40|$|The need {{to intensify}} {{knowledge}} of the pathogenesis of bovine <b>genital</b> <b>trichomoniasis</b> (BGT) led {{to the use of}} alternative animal models such as the mouse. Nevertheless, it is necessary to elucidate the dynamics of the infection in this animal species, evaluating different stages of the colonization and evolution of the pathological alterations. The immunohistochemistry (IHC) offers advantages over the routine histopathological staining techniques for the detection of the protozoan in tissues, cellular detritus and inside the macrophages. The goal {{of the present study was}} to demonstrate the presence of Tritrichomonas foetus in the reproductive tract of infected mice using an IHC technique. Female BALB/c mice were infected with a suspension of T. foetus by intravaginal route, in the estrum phase, detected by exfoliative vaginal cytology. After 10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed; uterus and vagina were fixed and histologically processed. Some slides were stained with HE. The rest of the slides were processed for IHC. An immunoadsorbed polyclonal serum against T. foetus was used. The avidine-biotine technique (HistoMouse, Zymed&# 153;) was employed. The histopathological studies showed a dilation of the uterine glands, presence of macrophages in the lumen of the organ and inner part of the endometrial glands. No T. foetus was identified using this method. The IHQ allowed additionally the identification of the protozoan in the endometrium, endometrial glands, uterine lumen and inside neutrophils and macrophages. The cytological studies stained with IHC showed either isolated T. foetus adhered to epithelial cells or inside macrophages.

40|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty-six beef bulls on southwestern Louisiana coastal range were {{evaluated}} for breeding soundness. Samples {{were taken to}} determine the incidence of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection, and the prepuce was cultured for potential pathogens. A high incidence (47. 6 %) of questionable and unsatisfactory potential breeders resulted mainly from 37. 0 % of the bulls exhibiting high numbers of abnormal sperm cells in the semen. Only bulls in the 4 -to 5 -yr age group exhibited the expected incidence of normal spermiograms. Genital campylobacteriosis was not diagnosed but there was <b>genital</b> <b>trichomoniasis</b> {{in three of the}} seven herds. Hemophilus somnus, mycoplasma and ureaplasma were isolated from the prepuce of 13. 3, 48. 8 and 36. 7 % of the bulls, respectively. Isolation of these organisms from the prepuce {{did not appear to be}} associated with abnormal spermiograms. Of the bulls studied, 34. 4 % had positive AGID reactions for BLV. Bulls seropositive to BLV had an increased incidence of leukocyte counts that were above the normal range. There was no apparent relationship between BLV infection and abnormal spermiograms...|$|E

Title of thesis: Evaluation of {{miconazole}} and metronidazole in {{the preparation}} using HPLC The subject of this work is the development and validation of a method for the simultaneous analysis of metronidazole and miconazole {{in the preparation}} using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A sample of the Klion D- 100 drug (vaginal tablets) containing 100 mg of metronidazole and 100 mg of miconazole-nitrate was analyzed.

As a stationary phase for the HPLC analysis a MERCK- LiChrosper 60 RP- select B 5 µm, 4 x 125 mm sorbent was used. A mixture of methanole and potassium carbonate buffer solution in ratios 80 : 20 a 20 : 80 (v/v) was selected as a mobile phase with the use of gradient elution. The flow-rate was set to 1 ml/min. The sample was injected in 10 µl batches with the temperature set to 25 žC. The detection of samples was undertaken with the wavelength fixed at 235 nm.

40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{variation in the}} quarterly incidence of some sexually transmitted diseases and other conditions in Scotland is {{compared with that of}} gonorrhoea and of conceptions leading to live births or abortions. The seasonal incidence for non-specific genital infections and for other conditions not requiring treatment in both men and women was similar to that of gonorrhoea, thus indicating an association with promiscuity, whereas the {{seasonal variation}} for candidosis in men and women-an infection not usually associated with promiscuity-was similar to that of conceptions. Differences between the sexes occurred, however, in the seasonal incidences of scabies, pubic lice, <b>genital</b> herpes, <b>trichomoniasis,</b> and other conditions requiring treatment; thus men with these conditions appeared to be more promiscuous than women. The seasonal variations in incidence of genital scabies and pubic lice indicate that these infestations are more easily transmitted by close bodily contact indoors during cold weather than in the open air...|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} infections, {{diseases}} and disorders {{that can affect}} the vagina, including candidal vulvovaginitis, vaginitis, vaginismus, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or cancer. Vaginitis is an inflammation of the vagina, and is attributed to several vaginal diseases, while vaginismus is an involuntary tightening of the vagina muscles caused by a conditioned reflex, or disease, during vaginal penetration. HIV/AIDS, human papillomavirus (HPV), <b>genital</b> herpes and <b>trichomoniasis</b> {{are some of the}} STIs that may affect the vagina, and health sources recommend safe sex (or barrier method) practices to prevent the transmission of these and other STIs.|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{the last}} two decades the {{incidence}} of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are dramatically increased and remain a major public health problem in developing countries. Trichomoniasis is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection caused by Trichomonas vaginalis which is a flagellated protozoon associated with vaginitis, cervicitis and urethritis. Researchers believed that pregnancy is one of the influencing factors of the <b>genital</b> <b>trichomoniasis</b> in women. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of trichomoniasis in pregnant women in Zanjan, Iran. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 1000 pregnant women were examined for diagnosis of trichomoniasis based on direct microscopic examination and culture method. They referred to the treatment and health centers of Zanjan, Northwest Iran, Demographic and personal information of the subjects were collected and evaluated with questionnaires. Results: Thirty-three out of one thousand examined individuals (3. 3 %) presented vaginal infection with T. vaginalis. Infection in women with lower gestational age, higher mothers’ age, higher parity and living in city were significantly associated with increased risk of vaginal trichomoniasis (P < 0. 05). Other variables were not significantly associated with parasite infection. Conclusions: The present study found that the infection with T. vaginalis is a health problem in pregnant women correlated with some epidemiological variables and can be considered with microbiological screening tests during pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|Tritrichomonas foetus is a {{flagellate}} protozoan and the etiological {{agent of}} bovine genital tri-chomoniasis [1], {{which is an}} infectious vene- real disease. This parasite is usually found as- sociated with the mucosal surface of the uro- genital tract in females or the male preputial and penile membranes. In females, the clinical ma-nifestations may include abortion, with repe- tition of estrus at irregular intervals, vaginitis, cervicitis, endometritis, and pyometra. Parasi- tized males may have a discharge with small nodules in the preputial membrane. After that, the bulls have no clinical symptoms, and are thus an asymptomatic carrier that may spread the infection. Considering that a bull could cover up to twenty females [2], bovine <b>genital</b> <b>trichomoniasis</b> is a serious medical and veteri- nary problem, with economical repercussion for beef and milk production. As T. foetus is an amitochondrial and aerotolerant organism, en- ergy production under low O 2 tension in the protozoan is done via hydrogenosome, which, as the name suggests, is the organelle where H 2 is generated [3, 4, 5]. The molecular machinery of mitochondrial cell death is, therefore, absent in this parasite and the mechanism that activates of cell death program is not clear. This review seeks to understand {{the characteristics of the}} protozoan parasite T. foetus in order to propose new therapies for animals suffering from this infectious and contagious agent...|$|E

A necessidade de aumentar o conhecimento da patogenia da tricomoníase genital bovina (BGT) conduziu ao uso de modelos experimentais alternativos como o camundongo. Não obstante, é necessário elucidar a dinâmica da infecção nesta espécie e avaliar as diferentes fases da colonização e evolução das alterações patológicas. A imunohistoquímica (IHQ) oferece vantagens sobre as técnicas histoquímicas de rotina para a observação do protozoário em tecidos, detritos celulares e dentro de macrófagos. O objetivo do presente trabalho foi demonstrar pelo uso de uma técnica de IHQ a presença de Tritrichomonas foetus no sistema reprodutivo de camundongos infectados. Camundongos BALB/c fêmeas foram infectados pela via intravaginal, com uma suspensão de T. foetus, na fase de estro, detectado com citologia exfoliativa vaginal. Depois de 10 semanas, os animais foram sacrificados; útero e vagina forma fixados e processados para histologia. Alguns cortes foram corados com HE. O restante dos cortes foi processado para IHQ. Foi usado um soro policlonal imunoadsorvido anti-T. foetus. A técnica de avidina-biotina (HistoMouse, Zymed&# 153;) foi empregada. Os estudos histopatológicos mostraram uma dilatação das glândulas uterinas, presença de macrófagos no lúmen do órgão e parte interna das glândulas endometriais. T. foetus não foi identificado por esse método. A IHQ permitiu identificar as mesmas lesões observadas e a presença do protozoário no endométrio, nas glândulas endometriais, no lúmen uterino e dentro de neutrófilos e macrófagos. O estudo citológico em lâminas coradas por IHQ, mostrou T. foetus aderido a células epiteliais, ou dentro de macrófagos.

40|$|The {{practice}} guideline on STD consultations {{from the}} Dutch College of General Practitioners sets out {{guidelines for the}} {{diagnosis and treatment of}} Chlamydia-infection, gonorrhoea, syphilis, <b>trichomoniasis,</b> <b>genital</b> herpes condylomata acuminata, hepatitis B, HIV-infection and pubic lice. Testing for Chlamydia-infection is always indicated if an STD is suspected but the necessity of also testing for gonorrhoea, syphilis, hepatitis B or HIV-infection depends on the likely risk. For the diagnosis of Chlamydia in a symptomatic woman it advises taking material from the cervix and urethra. In an asymptomatic woman Chlamydia infection is excluded by means of a urine test. In men a urethral swab of {{the first part of the}} urinary stream can be used for diagnosis. The first choice of treatment for gonorrhoea is a single 1 g intramuscular dose ofcefotaxime.

40|$|Recently, the US Department ofHealth and Human Services(DHHS) {{issued a}} report on a work-shop that {{synthesised}} evidence regard-ing the effectiveness of latex condoms {{for the prevention of}} sexually transmit-ted infections (STIs). 1 The report cited evidence that condoms are effective in preventing HIV transmission and female to male transmission of gonorrhoea, but stated that empirical evidence was insuf-ficient to evaluate the degree of risk reduction provided by condoms with regard to chlamydia, syphilis, chancroid, <b>trichomoniasis,</b> <b>genital</b> herpes, and human papillomavirus. One important implication of the report {{is that there is a}} need for further research on condom effectiveness. As the report noted, “to definitively answer the remaining ques-tions about condom effectiveness for preventing STD infections will require well designed and ethically sound clini-cal studies. ” 1 Besides the research perspective, from an applied public health perspective, intensified efforts to test condom effec-tiveness are urgently needed.

40|$|Not {{the final}} {{published}} versionOBJECTIVE: To examine whether commercial sex transactions were more common and/or transmission between sex workers and clients more efficient in two African cities with high HIV prevalence (Kisumu, Kenya and Ndola, Zambia) compared with two with relatively low HIV prevalence (Cotonou, Benin and Yaoundé, Cameroon). METHODS: Data on sexual behaviour, HIV and sexually transmitted infections {{were collected from}} representative samples of around 300 female sex workers in each city. Sexual behaviour data from a population-based study of around 1000 men aged 15 - 49 in each city were used to estimate the extent of contact with sex workers. RESULTS: The number of sex workers per 1000 males was highest in Kisumu and Ndola, but other estimates of the extent or characteristics of sex work contact showed no consistent differences between high or low prevalence cities. HIV prevalence among sex workers was 75 % in Kisumu, 69 % in Ndola, 55 % in Cotonou and 34 % in Yaoundé. The prevalence of <b>genital</b> ulceration and <b>trichomoniasis</b> was higher among sex workers in Kisumu and Ndola but no clear pattern was seen for the other sexually transmitted infections. Around 70 % of sex workers in Cotonou reported use of a condom with the last client, markedly {{higher than in the}} other cities. CONCLUSIONS: Although sex work is likely to have {{played an important role in}} the spread of HIV in all four cities, differences in present patterns of sex work do not appear to explain the differential spread of HIV. However, high levels of condom use among sex workers may have slowed the spread from sex workers to the general population in Cotonou, highlighting the importance of interventions among sex workers and their clients...|$|R
40|$|O presente trabalho aborda duas das mais importantes doenças sexualmente transmitidas de bovinos, a campilobacteriose genital bovina e a tricomonose genital bovina causadas pelo Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis e pelo Tritrichomonas foetus, respectivamente. O primeiro capítulo contém uma revisão de {{literatura}} sobre as duas enfermidades na qual são abordados aspectos relacionados à epidemiologia, diagnóstico, medidas de controle, distribuição, fatores de risco e imunidade. Estudos {{in vitro}} sobre a interação entre C. fetussubsp. venerealis e T. foetus com células epiteliais são apresentados no segundo e terceiro capítulos, respectivamente,. A cinética de transcrição de CXCL 8 pelos microrganismos foram avaliadas usando as linhagens epiteliais HeLa, MDBK, HEK 293, HEK 293 -TLR 2, HEK 293 -TLR 4 /MD- 2 por qRT-PCR após realização de cinética de infecção com os iniciadores específicos para CXCL 8, TLR 2, TLR 4, MD- 2. Neste estudo, a amostra de C. fetus subsp. venerealis NCTC 10354 T, previamente ativada por três passagens em novilhas virgens, foicapaz de induzir a transcrição de CXCL 8 via TLR 2 após 6 h em células epiteliais indicando a participação desta quimiocina na resposta imune inicial contra o microrganismo. A amostra de T. foetus isolada de trato genital de fêmea bovina foi capaz de induzir a expressão de CXCL 8 via TLR 4 /MD- 2 após 18 h de infecção. Em ambas as enfermidades a resposta humoral está bem definida, entretanto, é necessário a compressão da resposta imune inata á essas infecções, o que poderá propiciar um avanço no conhecimento da imunidade de mucosas notrato genital e contribuir para o maior conhecimento das patogenias. The {{present study is}} about {{two of the most}} important sexually transmitted diseases in cattle, bovine genital campylobacteriosis and bovine <b>genital</b> <b>trichomoniasis</b> caused by Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis and by Tritrichomonas foetus respectively. In the first chapter, there is a literature review of the two diseases, focusing on aspects related to epidemiology, diagnosis, control measures, distribution, risk factors and immunity. In the second and third chapters, we studied the interaction of C. fetus subsp. venerealis and T. foetus with epithelial cells in vitro respectively. The kinetics of CXCL 8 transcription in microorganisms were evaluated by RT-PCR using epithelial cells: HeLa, MDBK, HEK 293, HEK 293 -TLR 2, HEK 293 -TLR 4 /MD- 2, after infection kinetics, with the use of specific primers for CXCL 8, TLR 2, TLR 4, MD- 2. In this study, the C. fetus subsp. venerealis NCTC 10354 T strain, previously activated by three passages in virgin heifers, was able to induce the expression of CXCL 8 via TLR 2 in epithelial cells after 6 h indicating the involvement of this chemokine in the initial immune response against theorganism. T. foetus isolated from bovine female genital tract was able to induce the transcription of CXCL 8 via TLR 4 /MD- 2 18 h after infection. In both diseases the humoral response is well defined, however, is needed to compress the innate immune response, which will provide abetter understanding of the mucosal immunity in the genital tract, contributing to a greater knowledge of the pathogenesis...|$|E
