25|$|Such was the {{impression}} of Lever’s demeanour and testimony on the defence team that, {{as soon as the}} court was assembled on the following day, they capitulated completely. They also stated that, on behalf of their clients that they wished to retract completely “every imputation made upon Mr Lever's honour and integrity” and express their deepest regrets for having made such malicious attacks upon him. There followed a scene on the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> wherein the legal teams literally haggled over the size of the financial settlement. In the end, the sum agreed to was fifty-thousand pounds, plus around forty-thousand which was eventually awarded from individual newspapers. This victory was celebrated with a day’s holiday at Port Sunlight, where Lever blithely addressed the employees and other spectators who cheered and applauded their hero.|$|E

60|$|The {{judge had}} no sooner taken his seat, than the {{officer on the}} <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> called out 'Silence!' in a {{commanding}} tone, upon which another officer in the gallery cried 'Silence!' in an angry manner, whereupon three or four more ushers shouted 'Silence!' in a voice of indignant remonstrance. This being done, a gentleman in black, who sat below the judge, proceeded to call over {{the names of the}} jury; and after a great deal of bawling, it was discovered that only ten special jurymen were present. Upon this, Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz prayed a TALES; the gentleman in black then proceeded to press into the special jury, two of the common jurymen; and a greengrocer and a chemist were caught directly.|$|E
60|$|As Perker spoke, Mrs. Bardell {{began to}} recover by slow degrees, while Mrs. Cluppins, after a careful survey of Master Bardell's buttons and the button-holes {{to which they}} {{severally}} belonged, placed him on the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> {{in front of his}} mother--a commanding position in which he could not fail to awaken the full commiseration and sympathy of both judge and jury. This was not done without considerable opposition, and many tears, {{on the part of the}} young gentleman himself, who had certain inward misgivings that the placing him within the full glare of the judge's eye was only a formal prelude to his being immediately ordered away for instant execution, or for transportation beyond the seas, during the whole term of his natural life, at the very least.|$|E
60|$|Everybody present, {{except the}} one wigged gentleman {{who looked at}} the ceiling, stared at him. All the human breath in the place, rolled at him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire.

Conspicuous among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall of Newgate, Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a whet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with the waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not, that flowed at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him in an impure mist and rain.|$|E

5000|$|A judge's {{chambers}} is <b>the</b> office <b>of</b> a judge, where {{certain types}} of matters can be heard [...] "in chambers", also known as In camera, rather than in open court.

Judge's chambers are often located on upper <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> house, away from <b>the</b> <b>court</b> rooms, sometimes in groupings of judge's chambers. In some jurisdictions, a court room, rather than the judge's actual chambers, are used to hear matters [...] "in chambers". Such court rooms may also be called [...] "chambers".|$|R

But no further attempt was made to shoot him in the {{neighbourhood}} of Headford. [...] "Lax finds it too hot," [...] he said, [...] "since that day in the court house, and has gone away for the present. I nearly know where he is; but there is no good catching him till I get some sort of evidence against him, and if I locked him up as a 'suspect,' he would become a martyr and a hero {{in the eyes of the}} whole party. The worst of it is that though twenty men swore that they had seen it, no Galway jury would convict him." [...] But nevertheless he was indefatigable in following up the murderer of poor Florian. [...] "As for the murder in the court house," [...] he said, [...] "I do believe that though it was done in the presence of an immense crowd no one actually saw it. I have the pistol, but what is that? The pistol was dropped on the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> house." ...|$|E

50|$|A Whirlybug {{is similar}} to an {{electric}} bumper car. It is round, with a bumper {{going all the way}} around. Unlike most bumper cars, however, power is not provided by an overhead grid, but rather by alternating conducting plates that make up the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>court.</b> This means that Whirlybugs are more complex than traditional bumper cars, but this is necessary, as an overhead grid would obstruct play. A Whirlybug is steered by a handle that looks like a crank. This handle allows steering not just side to side, but also backwards. In this aspect, it is very different from a traditional bumper car.|$|E
