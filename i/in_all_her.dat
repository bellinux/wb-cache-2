The bridge reveals the king's jealousy, although this may have been justified, as her former lover Durrieux had been caught with her on several occasions. Caroline tried to pass him off as her brother when Leopold caught the two together; one publication reported that she and Durrieux had placed secret electric bells <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>her</b> residences so that servants could warn her when the king was approaching.|$|E

25|$|Horn {{explores the}} mutable nature {{of art and}} {{identity}} through sculptures, works on paper, photography, and books. She describes drawing as the key activity <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>her</b> work because drawing is about composing relationships. Horn’s drawings concentrate on the materiality of the objects depicted. She also uses words {{as the basis for}} drawings and other works. Horn crafts complex relationships between the viewer and her work by installing a single piece on opposing walls, in adjoining rooms, or throughout a series of buildings. She subverts the notion of ‘identical experience’, insisting that one’s sense of self is marked by a place in the here-and-there, and by time in the now-and-then. She describes her artworks as site-dependent, expanding upon the idea of site-specificity associated with Minimalism. Horn’s work also embodies the cyclical relationship between humankind and nature—a mirror-like relationship in which we attempt to remake nature in our own image.|$|E

25|$|Bulgaria: Since {{the start}} of the {{inception}} of rhythmic gymnastics as a World Championship event, Bulgaria was in competition with the USSR, during the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, Bulgaria has won 10 individual World Titles with its star gymnasts Maria Gigova- 3 time World AA Champion, Neshka Robeva and Kristina Guiourova, the 1980s marked the height of Bulgarian success known as the Golden Girls of Bulgaria, with gymnasts Iliana Raeva, Anelia Ralenkova, Lilia Ignatova, Diliana Gueorguieva, Bianka Panova, Adriana Dunavska, Elizabeth Koleva dominating the World Championships. Bianka Panova became the first rhythmic gymnast to make a clean sweep of all five individual events at a World Championship by attaining full marks. She also became the first rhythmic gymnast to get onto the Guinness Book of Records by her perfect performance of full 10 marks <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>her</b> routines (total of 8) at a World Championship and received the trophy personally from the President of the International Olympic Committee at that time, Juan Antonio Samaranch. The early 1990s were marked by the full domination of Maria Petrova- 3 time World AA Champion and 3 time European AA Champion. The early 2000s marked the decline of individual RG of Bulgaria though with still a few notable gymnasts like Simona Peycheva and Sylvia Miteva.

Although a practising Catholic, she instilled <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>her</b> children the importance of spirituality over religion, a trait that was influential in Harrison's embracing of Hinduism in 1966. Louise was also diligent in replying to her son's fan mail and, in the words of music journalist John Harris, she [...] "stood alone among the Beatle parents as an active champion of their talents".|$|E

[...] She also commented on Gaga's fashion sense and style in her costumes by saying, [...] "In an hour, Gaga proved her star power by packing <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>her</b> hits, displaying influences that ranged from Motown to 80s pop, and exhibiting a fearless fashion sense in several costume changes, none of which covered her bum." ...|$|E

500|$|Critic Robert B. Stepto {{states that}} the poem [...] "One More Round", in And Still I Rise is heavily {{influenced}} by the work and protest songs of the past. The even-number stanzas in the eight-stanza poem create a refrain like those found in many work songs and are variations of many protest poems. Stepto is impressed with Angelou's {{creation of a new}} art form out of work and protest forms, but does not feel that she develops it enough. He places Angelou's work in the tradition of other Black poets, and compares the poems in And Still I Rise to the works of Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks, and Sterling Brown. Stepto also praises Angelou for borrowing [...] "various folk rhythms and forms and thereby buttresses her poems by evoking aspects of a culture's written and unwritten heritage". Despite Angelou's strong criticism of racism, she also asserted <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>her</b> writings what Hagen calls a recurring theme, that [...] "we are more alike than unalike".|$|E
500|$|Angelou's {{humor in}} Caged Bird and <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>her</b> autobiographies {{is drawn from}} Black {{folklore}} and is used to demonstrate {{that in spite of}} severe racism and oppression, Black people thrive and are, as Hagen states, [...] "a community of song and laughter and courage". Hagen states that Angelou is able to make an indictment of institutionalized racism as she laughs at her flaws and the flaws of her community and [...] "balances stories of black endurance of oppression against white myths and misperceptions". Hagen also characterize Caged Bird as a [...] "blues genre autobiography" [...] because it uses elements of blues music. These elements include the act of testimony when speaking of one's life and struggles, ironic understatement, and the use of natural metaphors, rhythms, and intonations. Hagen also sees elements of African American sermonizing in Caged Bird. Angelou's use of African-American oral traditions creates a sense of community in her readers, and identifies those who belong to it.|$|E
