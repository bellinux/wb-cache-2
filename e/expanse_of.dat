5|$|Aristarchus {{is located}} on an {{elevated}} rocky rise, known as the Aristarchus Plateau, {{in the midst of}} the Oceanus Procellarum, a large <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> lunar mare. This is a tilted crustal block, about 200km across, that rises to a maximum elevation of 2km above the mare in the southeastern section. Aristarchus is just to the east of the crater Herodotus and the Vallis Schröteri, and south of a system of narrow sinuous rilles named Rimae Aristarchus.|$|E

5|$|Benjamin Ogle Tayloe married Julia Maria Dickinson on November 8, 1824. Although Tayloe {{preferred}} {{to live at}} Windsor, his estate in King George County, Virginia, his wife asked that they move into the city, where she was more comfortable. The house was constructed on Lots 10 and 11 in Square 221. At {{the time of the}} building's construction in 1828, the <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> the city from 15th Street NW (one block east of the home) to 17th Street NW from the White House north to H Street NW was a flat field bare of trees and shrubs.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the river}} {{mouth and the}} River Witham, a large <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> {{saltmarsh}} provides breeding grounds for common redshank, Eurasian oystercatcher and reed bunting in the summer, and Eurasian wigeon, mallard, common shelduck and common teal in the winter. Birds of prey such as hen harrier and merlin feed on the flocks of linnet and twite, while the mudflats support dunlin, whimbrel, and bar-tailed godwit. The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust have a reserve there, which is next to RSPB Frampton Marsh, a reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} week, the Luftwaffe had {{achieved}} air supremacy over the battlefields of all the army groups, but was unable to effect this air dominance over the vast <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> the western Soviet Union.

5|$|Lincolnshire has {{two primary}} bike paths that cover a large <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> the village. One {{runs in a}} north-south {{direction}} alongside Riverwoods Road in {{the eastern half of}} the village, while the other runs in an east-west direction from the eastern half of the village, across the Des Plaines River, and to the village hall in {{the west side of the}} village. Smaller bike paths connect individual neighborhood areas within and around Lincolnshire.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July, Rupert outmanoeuvred the Covenanters and Parliamentarians {{to relieve}} the city. The next day, he sought battle with them {{even though he was}} outnumbered. He was dissuaded from attacking {{immediately}} and during the day both sides gathered their full strength on Marston Moor, an <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> wild meadow west of York. Towards evening, the Covenanters and Parliamentarians themselves launched a surprise attack. After a confused fight lasting two hours, Parliamentarian cavalry under Oliver Cromwell routed the Royalist cavalry from the field and, with Leven's infantry, annihilated the remaining Royalist infantry.|$|E

5|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} place the Acra in the Upper City on Jerusalem's western hill, within the area currently occupied by the Old City's Jewish Quarter. These propositions seek to locate the Acra within Antiochia, the Hellenistic polis established in Jerusalem according to 2 Maccabees. This conjectural new city would have been hippodamic in plan and therefore would have required a flat <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> land which only the western hill could have provided. Furthermore, {{the eastern edge of}} the hill is adjacent to the Temple Mount and higher in altitude—two characteristics attributed to the Seleucid citadel.|$|E
5|$|The bloody Wheatfield {{remained}} {{quiet for}} the rest of the battle. But it took a heavy toll on the men who traded possession back-and-forth. The Confederates had fought six brigades against 13 (somewhat smaller) Federal brigades, and of the 20,444 men engaged, about 30% were casualties. Some of the wounded managed to crawl to Plum Run but could not cross it. The river ran red with their blood. As with the Cornfield at Antietam, this small <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> agricultural ground would be remembered by veterans as a name of unique significance in the history of warfare.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} {{continues}} the Human exploration of interstellar space by {{the crew of}} Enterprise, and further mention is made of the Temporal Cold War. The early encounters and historic culture of familiar Star Trek franchise races, such as the Vulcans, Andorians, Klingons, Romulans, Tholians, Borg, and Tellarites, are also explored further. The season ends with a cliffhanger that sets up the Xindi story arc, set in the Delphic <b>Expanse,</b> <b>of</b> the third season.|$|E

Significant <b>expanses</b> <b>of</b> bay mud are present nearby: in Redwood Creek, Westpoint Slough and especially {{at the mouth of}} Redwood Creek, where bay muds extend almost two kilometers into San Francisco Bay. In fact, the Port of Redwood City {{is the only}} major California port with significant <b>expanses</b> <b>of</b> natural habitat area in its immediate proximity.|$|R
5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> {{partially}} consolidated {{particles in}} a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E
5|$|As English cathedrals {{are often}} {{surrounded}} by an <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> green lawn, the plan is usually clearly visible at ground level, {{which is not the}} case with the many European cathedrals that are closely surrounded by town or monastic buildings. The general impression is that the English cathedral sprawls across its site with many projecting limbs. These horizontal projections are visibly balanced by the strong verticals of the massive towers, which may be one, two or three in number. Many of the cathedrals, particularly those like Winchester, St. Albans and Peterborough where the towers are not particularly high, give an impression of tremendous length and have been described as resembling “aircraft carriers”.|$|E
5|$|During Darwin's lifetime, many {{geographical}} {{features were}} given his name. An <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> water adjoining the Beagle Channel was named Darwin Sound by Robert FitzRoy after Darwin's prompt action, {{along with two}} or three of the men, saved them from being marooned on a nearby shore when a collapsing glacier caused a large wave that would have swept away their boats, and the nearby Mount Darwin in the Andes was named in celebration of Darwin's 25th birthday. When the Beagle was surveying Australia in 1839, Darwin's friend John Lort Stokes sighted a natural harbour which the ship's captain Wickham named Port Darwin: a nearby settlement was renamed Darwin in 1911, and it became the capital city of Australia's Northern Territory.|$|E
50|$|This is a rough generalization, {{as large}} <b>expanses</b> <b>of</b> North America and Asia contain no {{documented}} caves, whereas {{areas such as}} the Madagascar dry deciduous forests and parts of Brazil contain many documented caves. As the world's <b>expanses</b> <b>of</b> soluble bedrock are researched by cavers, the distribution of documented caves is likely to shift. For example, China, despite containing around half the world's exposed limestone—more than 1000000 km2—has relatively few documented caves.|$|R
