40|$|In {{this article}} we {{investigate}} the permeability of a porous medium as given in Darcy's law. The permeability is described by an effective <b>hydraulic</b> pore <b>radius</b> in the porous medium, the fluctuation in local <b>hydraulic</b> pore <b>radii,</b> the length of streamlines, and the fractional volume conducting flow. The effective <b>hydraulic</b> pore <b>radius</b> is related to a characteristic hydraulic length, the fluctuation in local <b>hydraulic</b> <b>radii</b> is related to a constriction factor, the length of streamlines {{is characterized by a}} tortuosity, and the fractional volume conducting flow from inlet to outlet is described by an effective porosity. The characteristic length, the constriction factor, the tortuosity and the effective porosity are thus intrinsic descriptors of the pore structure relative to direction. We show that the combined effect of our pore structure description fully describes the permeability of a porous medium. The theory is applied to idealized porous media, where it reproduces Darcy's law for fluid flow derived from the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. We also apply this theory to full network models of Fontainebleau sandstone, where we show how the pore structure and permeability correlate with porosity for such natural porous media. This work establishes how the permeability can be related to porosity, in the sense of Kozeny-Carman, through fundamental and well-defined pore structure parameters: characteristic length, constriction, and tortuosity.

The applicability of these parameters in reservoir calculations is, in many cases, reservoir specific.

An experimental program has been conducted to determine the electrical and petrophysical parameters of Shu’aiba carbonate reservoir, which is located in southeastern Saudi Arabia. Shu’aiba reservoir is a heterogeneous carbonate formation with various facies due to digenetic alteration of the original rock fabric. The measured electrical and petrophysical properties include formation resistivity factor FRF, cementation exponent m, saturation exponent n, porosity φ, permeability K, capillary pressure Pc, and irreducible water saturation Swir.

The correlation of such properties is an excellent tool for understanding the micro- and mesoscopic fracture networks and their relation to permeability in the Rotokawa Andesite as follows: (1) we have shown that the porosity and crack density are closely linked (Figure  8 A), (2) acoustic velocity and crack density are closely linked (Figure  8 D), and (3) there is a power law correlation of Vp and permeability (Figure  11 F). Thus, there is a direct link of P-wave velocity to permeability that is reliant on the crack densities of the samples. The relationship we present in Figure  11 F shows a power-law fit which would indicate that the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>radii</b> of the pore space (pore and cracks) are similar in size but that the higher the concentration of cracks, the higher the permeability we observe (Bourbie and Zinszner [1985]).|$|R

40|$|For many years, river {{modelling}} {{has been}} a core subject {{in the field of}} hydraulics. Over the past few decades, various {{attempts have been made to}} build models for flow. The distribution of shear stress over the wetted perimeter of a meandering open channel is one of the common river engineering problem. It is a key parameter to determine bank erosion and river migration. The influence of turbulence, the secondary flow, the curvature effect, the shape of the cross-section and the boundary condition are some among many technical hitches that are generally related in one way or another to the boundary shear stress making it difficult to analyse. Although some recent works have shed light on the phenomenon of boundary shear distribution, there are still several unexplored aspects that worth consideration. The research work which is presented in this thesis is an attempt to devise an analytical method, which could compute the average shear stress acting on the bed, inner wall and outer wall of a meandering channel. The attempt relies on splitting the channel cross-section into sub-regions and computing respective <b>hydraulic</b> <b>radii</b> by energy balance method.

The {{technology of}} hydraulic transportation of solid capsules in pipes is advanced {{to the point of}} practical feasibility by the development and successful operation of experimental equipment in the laboratory. This involves the innovation of aspects of the technology concerned, such as novel booster pumps, injectors and metering equipment. The effect of independent variables such as capsule geometry, density, roughness and concentration as well as mean water velocity and pipe inclination are investigated. It is shown to what extent these variables affect the dependent variables. A theoretical analysis is presented for the determination of dependent variables, such as capsule velocity, excess energy and power dissipation. Flow conditions around static capsules are shown to be amenable to analysis, supplemented by experimentally determined coefficients.

The visualization of different instantaneous and periodically two-phase flow is conducted for different experimental conditions. The two-phase flow characterization is obtained using the image processing. Annular, slug bubbly, spherical bubbly, and wavy flows are observed by varying the steam inlet pressure and cooling heat transfer. The {{cycle of the}} periodically flows are compared. It is shown that increasing the cooling heat flow rate reduces {{the number of the}} instabilities and the injected bubbles. The axial vapor velocity decreases during the waves growth. The local distribution of the condensate film thickness is analyzed. It is shown that the liquid film becomes thinner near the meniscus-like interface because of the surface tension effect.

40|$|The {{pore size}} r{sub p} in a gel is {{determined}} by the extent of shrinkage of the gel network during drying. Shrinkage is driven by the collapse of the gel network in response to the capillary pressure P{sub c} exerted by the pore fluid. The extent of shrinkage depends on the balance between the capillary pressure P{sub c} in the pore fluid and the bulk modulus K{sub p} of the gel. The <b>hydraulic</b> pore <b>radius,</b> r{sub H} = 2 V{sub p}/S{sub a}, where V{sub p} is the pore volume and S{sub a} is the apparent N{sub 2 } BET surface area, is often used to characterize the pore size of a gel. A series of acid catalyzed silica gels dried in pore fluids with different {gamma}{sub lv}, showed that {{there is a limit to}} the minimum apparent r{sub H} obtainable in a gel, and when the volume fraction of porosity {phi} {le} 0. 37, r{sub H} becomes constant and {approximately} 0. 8 nm. In contrast, experimental data show that the true pore size r{sub p} of gels continues to decrease when {phi} {le} 0. 37. Analysis of their adsorption isotherms show that while r{sub H} apparently stays constant: (a) the BET C constant continues to increase, (b) the width and average of their pore size distributions continue to decrease, and (c) as shrinkage continues the gels eventually become non-porous to N{sub 2 } at 77 K but are still porous to CO{sub 2 } at 273 K.

40|$|The three {{dimensional}} {{structure of}} paper materials plays {{a critical role in}} the paper manufacturing process especially via its impact on the transport properties for fluids. Dewatering of the wet web, pressing and drying will benefit from knowledge of the relationships between the web structure and its transport coefficients. The structure of the pore space within a paper sheet is imaged in serial sections using x-ray micro computed tomography. The {{three dimensional structure}} is reconstructed from these sections using digital image processing techniques. The structure is then analyzed by measuring traditional descriptors for the pore space such as specific surface area and porosity. A sequence of microtomographs was imaged at approximately 2 m intervals and the three-dimensional pore-fiber structure was reconstructed. The pore size distributions for both in-plane as well as transverse pores were measured. Significant differences in the in-plane (XY) and the transverse directions in pore characteristics are found and may help partly explain the different liquid and vapor transport properties in the in-plane and transverse directions. Results with varying sheet structures compare favorably with conventional mercury intrusion porosimetry data. Interestingly, the transverse pore structure appears to be more open with larger pore size distribution compared to the in plane pore structure. This may help explain the differences in liquid and vapor transport through the in plane and transverse structures during the paper manufacturing process and during end-use application. Comparison of Z-directional structural details of hand sheet and commercially made fine paper samples show a distinct difference in pore size distribution both in the in-plane and transverse direction. Method presented here may provide a useful tool to the papermaker to truly engineer the structure of paper and board tailored to specific end-use applications. The difference in surface structure between the top and bottom sides of the porous material, i. e. "two-sidedness" due to processing and raw material characteristics may lead to differences in end-use performance. The measurements of surface structure characteristics include thickness distribution, surface volume distribution, contact fraction distribution and surface pit distribution. This complements our earlier method to analyze the bulk structure and Z-D structure of porous materials. As one would expect, the surface structure characteristics will be critically dependent on the quality and resolution of the images. This presents a useful tool to characterize and engineer the surface structure of porous materials such as paper and board tailored to specific end-use applications. This will also help troubleshoot problems related to manufacturing and end-use applications. This study attempted to identify the optimal resolution through a comparison between 3 D images obtained by monochromatic synchrotron radiation X-CT in phase contrast mode (resolution  1 m) and polychromatic radiation X-CT in absorption mode (res.  5 m). It was found that both resolutions have the ability to show the expected trends when comparing different paper samples. The low resolution technique shows fewer details resulting in lower specific surface area, larger pore channels, characterized as <b>hydraulic</b> <b>radii,</b> and lower tortuosities, where differences between samples and principal directions are more difficult to detect. The disadvantages of the high resolution images are high cost and limited availability of hard x-ray beam time as well as the small size of the sample volumes imaged. The results show that the low resolution images can be used for comparative studies, whereas the high resolution images may be better suited for fundamental research on the paper structure and its influence on paper properties, as one gets more accurate physical measurements. In addition, pore space diffusion model has been developed to simulate simultaneous diffusion in heterogeneous porous materials such as paper containing cellulose fibers and void spaces. Stochastic dynamic approach along with random walk simulation has been implemented to model simultaneous diffusion in 3 D matrix of cellulose fibers and pores. This model is suitable for simulating simultaneous diffusion in porous materials under variety of conditions including low relative humidity conditions where diffusion occurs predominantly through one medium i. e. pore space and high humidity conditions where both mediums (i. e. fiber and pore spaces) are highly conductive. Both pore as well as effective diffusivity values for paper samples of varying structure were compared with the experimental values and are in fair agreement especially through the thickness direction of samples. In addition to this, intrinsic fiber phase diffusivity has been estimated for the first time using a combination of simulation and experimental data...|$|R
