5|$|NigeriaSat-2, Nigeria's second satellite, {{was built}} as a {{high-resolution}} earth satellite by Surrey Space Technology Limited, a United Kingdom-based satellite technology company.

5|$|Airline EasyJet is {{interested}} in the inspection of aircraft with drones. It made a first inspection in 2015. Equipped with laser sensors and <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> camera, the drone performs autonomous flight around the aeroplane. It generates a three-dimensional image of the aircraft and transmits it to a technician. The operator can then navigate in this representation and zoom to display a high-resolution picture of some parts of the aircraft. The operator must then visually diagnose {{the presence or absence of}} defects. This approach avoids the use of platforms to observe the upper parts of the aeroplane.|$|E
5|$|An ant's head {{contains}} many sensory organs. Like most insects, ants have compound eyes made from numerous tiny lenses attached together. Ant eyes {{are good for}} acute movement detection, but do not offer a <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> image. They also have three small ocelli (simple eyes) {{on the top of}} the head that detect light levels and polarization. Compared to vertebrates, most ants have poor-to-mediocre eyesight and a few subterranean species are completely blind. However, some ants, such as Australia's bulldog ant, have excellent vision and are capable of discriminating the distance and size of objects moving nearly a metre away.|$|E

It was concluded that the jitter in the data was caused by stellar activity and not the presence of other planets.|$|E
5|$|Day of the Tentacle Remastered {{retains its}} {{two-dimensional}} cartoon-style art, redrawn at higher resolution for modern computers. The <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> character art was updated {{by a team}} led by Yujin Keim with consultation of Ahern and Chan. Keim's team used many of the original sketches of characters and assets from the two and emulated their style with improvements for modern graphics systems. Matt Hanson worked on recreating the background assets in <b>high</b> <b>resolution.</b> As with the Grim Fandango remaster, the player can switch {{back and forth between the}} original graphics and the high-resolution version. The game includes a more streamlined interaction menu, a command wheel akin to the approach used in Broken Age, but the player can opt to switch back to the original interface. The game's soundtrack has been redone within MIDI adapted to work with the iMUSE system. There is an option to listen to commentary from the original creators, including Schafer, Grossman, Chan, McConnell, Ahern, and Bajakian. The remaster contains the fully playable version of the original Maniac Mansion, though no enhancements have been made to that game-within-a-game.|$|E
