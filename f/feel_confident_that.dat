5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Montoya clinched his second consecutive pole position and his third of the season with a time of 1:22.216. Although he was happy with the feel of his car, he did not <b>feel</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> he could take pole position. Montoya was joined on the front row by Barrichello who recorded a lap 0.312 seconds slower and also went off into a gravel trap during qualifying. Michael Schumacher qualified third and admitted to making a mistake on his third run which prevented him from setting a quicker time. Ralf Schumacher had balance issues which meant his car alternated between understeer and oversteer en route to fourth position. He also managed three clear runs before his fourth was disrupted by a yellow flag. Trulli qualified fifth and was delighted with his car and tyres. Coulthard qualified in sixth position and felt his car's balance was good although felt it difficult to push hard and achieve ideal grip. Häkkinen took seventh and ran wide at the exit of Curva di Lesmo on his final timed run and crashed heavily into a barrier which resulted in a large amount of damage to the front and left side of his car. Häkkinen was unhurt but the crash caused qualifying to be suspended for thirteen minutes.|$|E
25|$|Forrest's injury issues {{continued}} {{after suffering}} a hamstring injury against Dundee in the first home game of the season. He only returned from injury in November and despite scoring his first goal of the season against St Mirren in December, Forrest {{was in and out}} of the first time throughout the winter as both the play and coaching staff did not <b>feel</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> Forrest's injury problems were over. He featured more often for Celtic in the Spring and came on a substitute in Celtic's 2–0 victory against Dundee United in the Scottish League Cup Final and scored the second goal and missed a penalty. Forrest win his seventh major honour as Celtic won the league for the fourth year in a row.|$|E

[...] Prior to the race, Oxford coach Pat Sweeney criticised Weiss: [...] "Their cox is so useless she might hit us. [...] It's not her fault, but Cambridge should have chosen someone who knows the river." [...] Weiss responded [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> I will make the {{decisions}} to make Cambridge win." ...|$|E

500|$|Music {{journalist}} Sarah Champion {{pointed out}} (prior to the million pound fire) that, [...] "Being 'in the money' doesn't mean they'll ever be rich. [...] always be , but their pranks {{will get more}} extravagant. If they earned £10 million, they'd blow it all by buying Jura or a fleet of K Foundation airships or a Van Gogh to be ceremonially burned." [...] "There are things we'd like to do which we haven't done.", Drummond told a journalist in 1991. [...] "Totally ludicrous things. We want to buy ships, have submarines. They really are stupid things I know, but I <b>feel</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> {{in the event of}} us selling ten million albums we would definitely {{go out and buy a}} submarine....Just to be able to say 'Look we've got a submarine and 808 State haven't'." ...|$|E
500|$|A common {{concern was}} that it was simply too {{vulnerable}} in traffic. Your Computer commented that [...] "a periscope would be handy if you intended driving the C5 on busy roads since your head is only at bonnet level." [...] The Guardian's motoring correspondent wrote of her [...] "grave misgivings about its use in congested traffic... On a sharp turn it too easily lifts a rear wheel, is hazardously silent, and low down. It disappears below a car driver's sight-line when pulling up alongside. The prospect of these vehicles merging into heavy traffic, dwarfed by heavy lorries, buses, and cars, is worrying. Their low speed risks turning them into mobile chicanes for other traffic." [...] Another Guardian writer wrote that he [...] "would not want to drive [...] C5 in any traffic at all. My head was on a level with the top of a juggernaut's tyres, the exhaust fumes blasted into my face. Even with the minuscule front and rear lights on, I could not <b>feel</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> a lorry driver so high above the ground would see me." [...] Sinclair issued a publicity photograph showing the C5's industrial designer, Gus Desbarats, in a C5 alongside a cardboard cutout of an Austin Mini to illustrate that the C5 driver's seated position was actually higher than that of a Mini driver.|$|E
2500|$|Vogt {{responded to}} the latest {{concerns}} by saying, [...] "I am not overly surprised by this as these are very weak signals, and adding 60 points onto 119 does not necessarily translate to big gains in sensitivity." [...] More recently, Vogt added, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> we have accurately and honestly reported our uncertainties and done a thorough and responsible job extracting what information this data set has to offer.

5000|$|Fitzsimmons’ views {{regarding}} ecosystem management, specifically endangered species, {{have created}} some controversy among environmentalists, such as Friends of the Earth. In his 1999 book Defending Illusions: Federal Protection of Ecosystems, he renounces {{the existence of}} ecosystems, claiming they are merely “mental constructs.” [...] Interior Secretary Gale Norton, who appointed Fitzsimmons to the Fuel Coordinator position, <b>feels</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> Fitzsimmons has a “wide range” of experience with environmental issues.|$|R
2500|$|Some Western {{observers}} {{who attended the}} trials {{said that they were}} fair and that the guilt of the accused had been established. They based this assessment on the confessions of the accused, which were freely given in open court, without any apparent evidence that they had been extracted by torture or drugging. The British lawyer and Member of Parliament D. N. Pritt, for example, wrote: [...] "Once again the more faint-hearted socialists are beset with doubts and anxieties", but [...] "once again we can <b>feel</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> when the smoke has rolled away from the battlefield of controversy it will be realized that the charge was true, the confessions correct and the prosecution fairly conducted".|$|E
2500|$|Many of Takahashi's {{works have}} been {{translated}} into English, {{as well as other}} European languages. Takahashi said that she did not know why her works are relatively popular with English speakers. Takahashi said [...] "Sure, there are cultural differences in my work. When I see an American comedy, even though the jokes are translated, there's always a moment when I feel puzzled and think, 'Ah, Americans would probably laugh at this more'. I suppose the same thing must happen with my books. It's inevitable. And yet, that doesn't mean my books can't be enjoyed by English-speaking readers. I <b>feel</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> there's enough substance to them that people from a variety of cultural backgrounds can {{have a lot of fun}} reading them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bonham arrived near Bexar around 11 am on March 3. [...] Wearing a white bandana in his hat {{to notify}} the Texians {{that he was one}} of them, he spurred his horse and rode, unmolested, through the Alamo gate as the ring of Mexican {{soldiers}} looked on in surprise. [...] Bonham's news, that Fannin was not coming after all, reportedly demoralized the Alamo garrison. [...] Travis sent a courier that evening to the Convention with news that the Texians had thus far survived the siege with no losses. [...] He warned, however, that: [...] "I look to the colonies alone for aid; unless it arrives soon, I shall have to fight the enemy on his own terms. I will, however, do the best I can under the circumstances, and I <b>feel</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> the determined valour and desperate courage, heretofore evinced by my men, will not fail them in the last struggle, and although they may be sacrificed to the vengeance of a Gothic enemy, the victory will cost the enemy so dear, that it will be worse for him than a defeat." [...] Travis ended his letter with news that despite the dearth of ammunition, his men would fire the 18-lb cannon three times each day as proof that they still held the fort. [...] Travis then wrote several private letters and entrusted all of the communications to John W. Smith, who volunteered to sneak through the enemy lines.|$|E

2500|$|On {{clinical}} grounds, {{patients who}} choose to use homeopathy in preference to normal medicine risk missing timely diagnosis and effective treatment, thereby worsening the outcomes of serious conditions. Critics of homeopathy have cited individual cases of patients of homeopathy failing to receive proper treatment for diseases {{that could have been}} easily diagnosed and managed with conventional medicine and who have died as a result, and the [...] "marketing practice" [...] of criticizing and downplaying the effectiveness of mainstream medicine. Homeopaths claim that use of conventional medicines will [...] "push the disease deeper" [...] and cause more serious conditions, a process referred to as [...] "suppression". Some homeopaths (particularly those who are non-physicians) advise their patients against immunization. Some homeopaths suggest that vaccines be replaced with homeopathic [...] "nosodes", created from biological materials such as pus, diseased tissue, bacilli from sputum or (in the case of [...] "bowel nosodes") faeces. While Hahnemann was opposed to such preparations, modern homeopaths often use them although {{there is no evidence to}} indicate they have any beneficial effects. Cases of homeopaths advising against the use of anti-malarial drugs have been identified. This puts visitors to the tropics who take this advice in severe danger, since homeopathic preparations are completely ineffective against the malaria parasite. Also, in one case in 2004, a homeopath instructed one of her patients to stop taking conventional medication for a heart condition, advising her on June 22, 2004 to [...] "Stop ALL medications including homeopathic", advising her on or around August 20 that she no longer needed to take her heart medication, and adding on August 23, [...] "She just cannot take ANY drugs – I have suggested some homeopathic remedies ... I <b>feel</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> if she follows the advice she will regain her health." [...] The patient was admitted to hospital the next day, and died eight days later, the final diagnosis being [...] "acute heart failure due to treatment discontinuation".|$|E
