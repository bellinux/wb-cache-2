Note {{that this is the}} only suitable attachment point on any of the drive wheels that is not fouled by the passage of the coupling rod or the connecting rod. The <b>eccentric</b> <b>crank</b> is of a length such that the pin attachment to the eccentric rod (2) is 90 degrees out of phase with the lead motion.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design by}} Borsig, under the {{supervision}} of chief engineer August Meister, was ready in 1919 but, due to material shortages, no locomotives were produced until 1922. They were three-cylinder locomotives, all cylinders driving the second coupled axle. Three sets of Walschaerts valve gear were used, the one for the inside cylinder being mainly located inside the frame, but driven from the same <b>eccentric</b> <b>crank</b> as the valve gear on the left-hand side; two eccentric rods of different lengths being attached to the same crank.|$|E
50|$|All {{the driving}} wheels have an {{out-of-balance}} {{which is caused}} by their off-center crank pins and attached components. The main driving wheels have the greatest unbalance since they have the biggest crankpin {{as well as the}} revolving portion of the main rod. They also have the valve gear <b>eccentric</b> <b>crank</b> and the back end of the eccentric rod. In common with the linked driving wheels they also have their own portion of the side rod weight. The part of the main rod assigned a revolving motion was originally measured by weighing it supported at each end. A more accurate method became necessary which split the revolving and reciprocating parts based on the position of the center of percussion. This position was measured by swinging the rod as a pendulum. The unbalance in the remaining driving wheels is caused by a crankpin and side rod weight. The side rod weights assigned to each crankpin are measured by suspending the rod on as many scales as there are crankpins or by calculation.|$|E

[...] He opposed Jews, foreigners, and 'odd people' [...] - [...] <b>eccentrics,</b> <b>cranks</b> and fanatics [...] - [...] having anything to do with government.|$|R
50|$|In the {{internal}} combustion engine, this task is performed by cams on a camshaft driving poppet valves, but this arrangement is not commonly used with steam engines, partly because achieving variable engine timing using cams is complicated. Instead, {{a system of}} <b>eccentrics,</b> <b>cranks</b> and levers is generally used to control a D slide valve or piston valve from the motion. Generally, two simple harmonic motions with different fixed phase angles are added in varying proportions to provide an output motion that is variable in phase and amplitude. A variety of such mechanisms have been devised over the years, with varying success.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1934 and 1940 {{eight of}} the first fifteen locos had their Gresley gear removed and were {{converted}} to a [...] "double Walschaerts" [...] valve gear which utilized a double <b>eccentric</b> (return) <b>crank</b> and second link {{on the right side}} (similar to the gear Baldwin used on its 3-cylinder experimental compound 4-10-2 #60000), which operated the valve for the inside cylinder. Union Pacific referred to this system as the [...] "third link." [...] The 4-12-2's constructed from 1928 utilized roller bearings in the Gresley lever bearings, thus none of these engines were converted. The pre-1928 engines not converted received the roller bearing levers in 1940, and no further conversions were made.|$|R
5000|$|... "Dawidoff {{has taken}} a mythic {{character}} and exposed him as an <b>eccentric</b> <b>crank</b> whose oversized feet were made almost entirely of clay. Dawidoff has accumulated a vast body of information in a remarkable job of research, especially considering that Berg, who {{died of a heart}} attack at age 70 in 1972, deliberately cloaked the details of his life in mystery. What Dawidoff has failed to do is distill it into a story calculated to hold a reader's interest. Rather, he presents an almost legalistic mass of evidence to prove that Berg followed up a career (1923-39) as a pseudo intellectual, third- string catcher by becoming a mediocre WW II spy, and then spent the last 25 years of his life as an unemployed vagabond, living off his charm and his wit and his vast store of friends. The only mystery left at the end of the book is whether to feel pity for Berg as a tragic, unfulfilled genius or irritation with him as a boor who gets more attention than he deserved. The reader is left knowing immeasurably more about Moe Berg, and caring immeasurably less." ...|$|E

50|$|American {{locomotives}} universally employed inside Stephenson {{valve gear}} placed between the frames until around 1900 when it quickly {{gave way to}} outside Walschaerts motion. In Europe, Stephenson gear could be placed either outside the driving wheels and driven by either <b>eccentrics</b> or return <b>cranks</b> or else between the frames driven from the axle through eccentrics, as was mostly the case in Great Britain.|$|R
50|$|In {{steam engines}} and {{internal}} combustion engines, valves {{are required to}} allow the entry and exit of gases at the correct times in the piston's cycle. These are worked by cams, <b>eccentrics</b> or <b>cranks</b> driven by the shaft of the engine. Early designs used the D slide valve but this has been largely superseded by Piston valve or Poppet valve designs. In steam engines {{the point in the}} piston cycle at which the steam inlet valve closes is called the cutoff and this can often be controlled to adjust the torque supplied by the engine and improve efficiency. In some steam engines, the action of the valves can be replaced by an oscillating cylinder.|$|R
50|$|The {{reciprocating}} action may be produced several ways. A crank or Scotch yoke type drive may be used, {{a swash plate}} type drive, a captive cam or eccentric, barrel cam, or other rotary to linear drive. Modern tools are built with variants {{of all of these}} mechanisms. <b>Eccentric</b> cam, <b>crank</b> and scotch yoke drives need balance weights to reduce vibration in the plane of the rotating element, and may still exhibit vibration that is objectionable to a user of a handheld saw and can lead to difficulty in controlling a cut. The swash plate drive has the advantage that there is little rotational out of balance, so the principal vibration is in line with the blade. This is generally controllable by keeping the foot of a handheld tool against the work.|$|R

40|$|Book synopsis: A {{maverick}} {{in her own}} time, Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle (1623 – 1673) {{was dismissed}} for three centuries as an <b>eccentric</b> <b>crank.</b> Yet {{the past few decades}} have witnessed a true renaissance in Cavendish studies, as scholars from diverse academic disciplines produce books, articles and theses on every aspect of her oeuvre. Cavendish's literary creations hold a wide appeal for modern readers because of her talent for thinking outside the rigid box that delimited the hierarchies of class, race and gender in seventeenth-century Europe. In so doing, she challenged the ultimate building blocks of early modern society, whether the tenets of Christianity, the social and political imperatives of patriarchy, or the arrogant claims of the new Baconian science. At the same time, Cavendish offers keen insights into current social issues. Her works have become a springboard for critical discourse on such topics as the nature of gender difference and the role of science in human life. Sara Mendelson's aim in compiling this volume is to convey to readers some idea of the scope and variety of scholarship on Cavendish, {{not only in terms of}} dominant themes, but of critical controversies and intriguing new pathways for investigation...|$|E
5000|$|Chidley {{was charged}} with {{offensive}} behaviour, deemed insane by the Lunacy Court on 3 August 1912 {{and sent to the}} Callan Park Hospital. His case sparked a lot of public debate about the use of the law to imprison people in asylums and he won a lot of public support, people regarding him as a well meaning <b>eccentric</b> or <b>crank</b> deprived of his liberty and his right to speak freely. In August 1916 Chidley was released from an asylum under conditions that he [...] "not address persons, and particularly women, by circular asking them to grant him interviews, in order that he might explain his theory to them." [...] He was banned from holding meetings in public parks but he was soon addressing Sydney crowds in the The Domain. On 16 February 1916 Chidley was again found insane and committed to Kenmore Mental Hospital at Goulburn.|$|R
50|$|No. 4767, {{built at}} Crewe and {{delivered}} in December 1947, had outside Stephenson valve gear: instead of <b>eccentrics,</b> double return <b>cranks</b> {{were used to}} drive the eccentric rods, and a launch-type expansion link was used. This one cost £13,278, which was about £600 more than those built {{at the same time}} with Walschaerts' valve gear. The aim of the experiment was to find out if a valve gear having variable lead (as opposed to the constant lead of the Walschaerts' motion) would affect performance. On trial, it proved to have no advantage, although in normal service it did gain a reputation as a good performer on banks.|$|R
50|$|It is {{most often}} {{employed}} in steam engines and used to convert rotary into linear reciprocating motion in order to drive a sliding valve or a pump ram. In order to do so an eccentric usually has a groove at its circumference around which is closely fitted a circular collar (eccentric strap) attached to which an eccentric rod is suspended {{in such a way}} that its other end can impart the required reciprocating motion. A return crank fulfils the same function except that it can only work at the end of an axle or on the outside of a wheel whereas an eccentric can also be fitted to the body of the axle between the wheels. Unlike a cam, which also converts rotary into linear motion at almost any rate of acceleration and deceleration, an <b>eccentric</b> or return <b>crank</b> can only impart simple harmonic motion.|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{engineering}} technology {{in recent years}} have brought demands for reliable wind turbine blade which can operate at different climatic condition and speeds. When failures occur they are expensive, {{not only in terms of}} the cost of replacement or repair, but also the costs associated with the down-time of the system of which they are part. Reliability is thus a critical economic factor and for designers to produce wind turbine blade with a high reliability they need to be able to accurately predict the stresses experienced by the different load condition. A wooden 1. 5 m wind turbine blade was tested by means of a mechanically operated test rig for fatigue failure. The rig uses a <b>crank</b> <b>eccentric</b> mechanism by variable load for each load cycle. The stress distribution in fatigue critical areas of the blade during testing was found to be similar to the expected stress distribution under normal operational conditio...|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{locomotives}} having Stephenson {{valve gear}} normally had this mounted {{in between the}} locomotive frames. In 1947, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway built a series of their Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 locomotives, most of which had the Walschaerts' valve gear that was normal for this class, but one of them, no. 4767, had Stephenson valve gear mounted outside the wheels and frames. Instead of <b>eccentrics,</b> double return <b>cranks</b> were used to drive the eccentric rods, and a launch-type expansion link was used.

40|$|A 2. 5 m {{long glass}} fibre {{reinforced}} plastic composite wind turbine blade was fatigue tested by means of a mechanically operated test rig. The rig uses a <b>crank</b> <b>eccentric</b> mechanism to flex the blade by a constant displacement in the flapwise direction for each load cycle. A yearly fatigue-loading spectrum for the blades has been developed from using short-term detailed aeroelastic and wind measurements, results from a detailed finite element model of the blade and averaged long-term wind data form the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. This spectrum contained over 200 load levels covering R ratios from 0 to 0. 9. An equivalent damage spectrum has been formulated to minimise the number of load levels within the spectrum without compromising the amount of damage done to the blade structure. Results of fatigue testing indicate that predictions are close to the measured fatigue life of the blade. The stress distribution in fatigue critical areas of the blade during testing was found to be similar to the expected stress distribution under normal operational condition...|$|R
