5|$|International {{reaction}} to the Dutch actions was negative. Neighbouring Australia and newly independent India were particularly active in supporting the Republic's cause in the UN, as was the Soviet Union and, most significantly, the United States. Dutch ships continued to be boycotted from loading and unloading by Australian waterside workers, a blockade that began in September 1945. The United Nations Security Council became {{directly involved in the}} conflict, establishing a <b>Good</b> <b>Offices</b> Committee to sponsor further negotiations, making the Dutch diplomatic position particularly difficult. A ceasefire, called for by UNSC resolution 27, was ordered by the Dutch and Sukarno on 4 August 1947. During the military action, on 9 December 1947 Dutch troops killed many civilians in the village of Rawagede (now Balongsari in Karawang, West Java).|$|E

This building was also to house the station master, the railway port superintendent, the goods supervisor, and their respective support staff. Renovation of this building for its new function was underway in September 1962, and was expected to be completed {{by the end of the}} year. Following completion of these renovations, and the relocation of the <b>goods</b> <b>office,</b> the old <b>Goods</b> <b>Office</b> building was scheduled for demolition. The demolition was delayed while the power supply for the station was re-routed, as it had been fed through the <b>Goods</b> <b>Office</b> building.

By 1966, when Thant was reappointed, all the big powers, in a unanimous vote of the Security Council, affirmed the importance of the secretary-generalship and his <b>good</b> <b>offices,</b> a clear tribute to Thant's work.|$|E

Intercommunal talks began in June 1968, through the <b>good</b> <b>offices</b> of the secretary-general, as part of the settlement.

Sir Edgar's secretary, told that their action would alienate the European powers and cause a 'fearful massacre of Armenians' but they replied that if they died they would do so as martyrs and patriots. They were assured of a pardon and unhindered departure from the city on board Sir Edgar Vincent's private yacht.|$|E

Although the newly reconstituted TNI was unable to offer significant military resistance, the blatant violation by the Dutch of an internationally brokered agreement outraged world opinion. International pressure forced the Dutch to halt their invasion force in August 1947. Sjahrir, who has been replaced as prime minister by Amir Sjarifuddin, flew to New York City to appeal Indonesian case in front of United Nations. UN Security Council issued a resolution calling for immediate ceasefire, and appointed a <b>Good</b> <b>Offices</b> Committee (GOC) to oversee the ceasefire.

The Italian-language version of the disputed Article 17 of the treaty stated that the Emperor of Ethiopia was obliged to conduct all foreign affairs through Italian authorities. This would in effect make Ethiopia a protectorate of the Kingdom of Italy. The Amharic version of the article however stated that the Emperor could use the <b>good</b> <b>offices</b> of the Kingdom of Italy in his relations with foreign nations if he wished. However, the Italian diplomats claimed that the original Amharic text included the clause and that Menelik II knowingly signed a modified copy of the Treaty.|$|E
