40|$|The immune {{effects of}} fowlpox virus (FPV) field <b>isolates</b> <b>and</b> vaccine strains were {{evaluated}} in chickens infected {{at the age}} of 1 day and 6 weeks. The field <b>isolates</b> <b>and</b> the obsolete vaccine strain (FPV S) contained integrated reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) provirus, while the current vaccine strain (FPVST) carries only REV LTR sequences. An indirect antibody ELISA was used to measure the FPV-specific antibody response. The non-specific humoral response was evaluated by injection of two T-cell-dependent antigens, sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and bovine serum albumin (BSA). There {{was no significant difference in}} the antibody response to FPV between chickens infected with FPV various <b>isolates</b> <b>and</b> strains at either age. In contrast, antibody responses to both SRBC and BSA were significantly lower in 1 -day-old chickens inoculated with field <b>isolates</b> <b>and</b> FPV S at 2 - 3 weeks post-inoculation. Furthermore, cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses measured by in vitro lymphocyte proliferation assay and in vivo using a PHA-P skin test were significantly depressed in chickens inoculated with field <b>isolates</b> <b>and</b> FPV S at the same periods. In addition, thymus and bursal weights were lower in infected chickens. These immunosuppressive effects were not observed in chickens inoculated with the current vaccine strain, FPVST, at any time. The results of this study suggest that virulent field <b>isolates</b> <b>and</b> FPV S have immunosuppressive effects when inoculated into young chickens, which appeared in the first 3 weeks post infection. REV integrated in the FPV field <b>isolates</b> <b>and</b> FPV S may have played a central role in the development of immunosuppression. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
