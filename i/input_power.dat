25|$|In practice, this {{relationship}} {{can be observed}} in bicycles: Bicycles are typically composed of two road wheels, front and rear gears (referred to as sprockets) meshing with a circular chain, and a derailleur mechanism if the bicycle's transmission system allows multiple gear ratios to be used (i.e. multi-speed bicycle), all of which attached to the frame. A cyclist, the person who rides the bicycle, provides the <b>input</b> <b>power</b> by turning pedals, thereby cranking the front sprocket (commonly referred to as chainring). The <b>input</b> <b>power</b> provided by the cyclist is equal to the product of cadence (i.e. the number of pedal revolutions per minute) and the torque on spindle of the bicycle's crankset. The bicycle's drivetrain transmits the <b>input</b> <b>power</b> to the road wheel, which in turn conveys the received power to the road as the output power of the bicycle. Depending on the gear ratio of the bicycle, a (torque, rpm)input pair is converted to a (torque, rpm)output pair. By using a larger rear gear, or by switching to a lower gear in multi-speed bicycles, angular speed of the road wheels is decreased while the torque is increased, product of which (i.e. power) does not change.|$|E
25|$|Factors {{which have}} been shown to affect the {{drive-train}} efficiency include the type of transmission system (chain, shaft, belt), the type of gearing system (fixed, derailleur, hub, infinitely variable), the size of the sprockets used, the magnitude of the <b>input</b> <b>power,</b> the pedalling speed, and how rusty the chain is. For a particular gearing system, different gear ratios generally have different efficiencies.|$|E

This is especially common in powerful lasers.|$|R
25|$|To achieve optimum noise {{performance}} DFAs are {{operated under}} {{a significant amount}} of gain compression (10dB typically), since that reduces the rate of spontaneous emission, thereby reducing ASE. Another advantage of operating the DFA in the gain saturation region is that small fluctuations in the <b>input</b> signal <b>power</b> are reduced in the output amplified signal: smaller <b>input</b> signal <b>powers</b> experience larger (less saturated) gain, while larger <b>input</b> <b>powers</b> see less gain.|$|R

The recessed electrode structure also resulted in lower saturation of output <b>power</b> at higher <b>input</b> <b>powers,</b> enabling it {{to take advantage of}} higher <b>input</b> <b>powers.</b> (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
25|$|In a dual {{resonant}} solid-state Tesla coil (DRSSTC), {{the electronic}} switching of the solid-state Tesla coil {{is combined with}} the resonant primary circuit of a spark-gap Tesla coil. The resonant primary circuit is formed by connecting a capacitor in series with the primary winding of the coil, so that the combination forms a series tank circuit with a resonant frequency near that of the secondary circuit. Because of the additional resonant circuit, one manual and one adaptive tuning adjustment are necessary. Also, an interrupter is usually used to reduce the duty cycle of the switching bridge, to improve peak power capabilities; similarly, IGBTs are more popular in this application than bipolar transistors or MOSFETs, due to their superior power handling characteristics. A current-limiting circuit is usually used to limit maximum primary tank current (which must be switched by the IGBT's) to a safe level. Performance of a DRSSTC can be comparable to a medium-power spark-gap Tesla coil, and efficiency (as measured by spark length versus <b>input</b> <b>power)</b> can be significantly greater than a spark-gap Tesla coil operating at the same <b>input</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E

25|$|In most {{amplifiers}} {{a reduction}} in gain takes place before hard clipping occurs; {{the result is a}} compression effect, which (if the amplifier is an audio amplifier) sounds much less unpleasant to the ear. For these amplifiers, the 1nbsp&dB compression point is defined as the <b>input</b> <b>power</b> (or output power) where the gain is 1nbsp&dB less than the small signal gain. Sometimes this non linearity is deliberately designed in to reduce the audible unpleasantness of hard clipping under overload.|$|E
25|$|Any real {{amplifier}} is {{an imperfect}} realization {{of an ideal}} amplifier. An important limitation of a real amplifier is that the output it generates is ultimately limited by the power available from the power supply. An amplifier saturates and clips the output if the input signal becomes too large for the amplifier to reproduce or exceeds operational limits for the device. The power supply may influence the output, so {{must be considered in}} the design. The power output from an amplifier cannot exceed its <b>input</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
25|$|Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton and Stanley Pons of the University of Utah {{hypothesized}} that the high compression ratio and mobility of deuterium that could be achieved within palladium metal using electrolysis might result in nuclear fusion. To investigate, they conducted electrolysis experiments using a palladium cathode and heavy water within a calorimeter, an insulated vessel designed to measure process heat. Current was applied continuously for many weeks, with the heavy water being renewed at intervals. Some deuterium {{was thought to be}} accumulating within the cathode, but most was allowed to bubble out of the cell, joining oxygen produced at the anode. For most of the time, the power input to the cell was equal to the calculated power leaving the cell within measurement accuracy, and the cell temperature was stable at around 30°C. But then, at some point (in some of the experiments), the temperature rose suddenly to about 50°C without changes in the <b>input</b> <b>power.</b> These high temperature phases would last for two days or more and would repeat several times in any given experiment once they had occurred. The calculated power leaving the cell was significantly higher than the <b>input</b> <b>power</b> during these high temperature phases.

The primary tuned circuit serves as the tank circuit of the oscillator, and the circuit resembles a radio transmitter. Unlike the previous circuits which generate a pulsed output, they generate a continuous sine wave output.

In general, continuous excitation produces lower output voltages from a given <b>input</b> <b>power</b> than pulsed excitation.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} this {{approach}} was producing enough energy in the resonators. As the electron passed the opening in the resonator they deposited some of their energy as radio waves, but only a small amount. To generate useful amounts of radio energy, the electrons either had to pass the resonators multiple times to deposit more energy in total, or huge electron currents had to be used. Single-chamber klystrons, like those being used at the time, had to go the latter route, and were difficult to make in a form with useful output given a reasonable <b>input</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
