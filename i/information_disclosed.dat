25|$|The Twelve Traditions {{encourage}} {{members to}} practice the spiritual principle of anonymity in the public media and members are also asked to respect each others' confidentiality. This is a group norm, however, and not legally mandated; there are no legal consequences to discourage those attending twelve-step groups from revealing <b>information</b> <b>disclosed</b> during meetings. Statutes on group therapy do not encompass those associations that lack a professional therapist or clergyman to whom confidentiality and privilege might apply. Professionals and paraprofessionals who refer patients to these groups, to avoid both civil liability and licensure problems, have been advised that they should alert their patients that, at any time, their statements made in meetings may be disclosed.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop {{a model of}} {{information}} disclosure among banks based on an endogenous interest rate for externally placed debt.

2500|$|Official {{conduct that}} does not invade a {{reasonable}} expectation of privacy is not a [...] "search" [...] under the Fourth Amendment. The possession of contraband is not anything {{in which a person}} can have a legitimate expectation of privacy, since it is by definition illegal to possess contraband. In United States v. Place (1983), the Court had held that a dog sniff is sui generis because it discloses only {{the presence or absence of}} narcotics. By contrast, the <b>information</b> <b>disclosed</b> by the heat sensing device in Kyllo v. United States (2001) disclosed the [...] "intimate details in a home, such as at what hour each night the lady of the house takes her daily sauna and bath." [...] People have a reasonable expectation that such information will be kept private, whereas they have no such expectation in the fact they possessed contraband. Thus, the use of a drug-sniffing dog does not intrude upon any reasonable expectation of privacy, and it was not unreasonable for the Illinois police to use the dog during the time it took them to issue a warning to Caballes.|$|E
