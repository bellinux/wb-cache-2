25|$|The Rosary is a devotion for the {{meditation}} of {{the mysteries}} of Jesus and Mary.“The gentle repetition of its prayers makes it an excellent means to moving into deeper meditation. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> an opportunity to open ourselves to God’s word, to refine our interior gaze by turning our minds {{to the life of}} Christ. The first principle is that meditation is learned through practice. Many people who practice rosary meditation begin very simply and gradually develop a more sophisticated meditation. The meditator learns to hear an interior voice, the voice of God”.|$|E
25|$|In {{modal logic}} (which studies {{theories}} of possibility and necessity), he has argued {{in favour of}} the non-normal system S7, rather than more traditional systems such as S4 or S5. Unlike other systems, S7 allows logicians to choose between competing logics, each of which, if true, would be necessarily true, but none of which are necessarily the correct system of necessary truths. As Irvine puts it, “just as being physically possible means nothing more than being consistent with the laws of physics, being logically possible means nothing more than being consistent with the laws of logic. However, this leaves open the question of which logic and which consistency relation are to be adopted. S7 gives us the language to discuss the possible denial of necessary truths. S7 gives us the language to assert not only that some propositions really are necessary; <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> the language also to note that their denials, although impossible, remain possibly possible.” In other words, there is a mechanism in which even sets of necessary truths {{can be compared to}} their alternatives.|$|E
25|$|Next in {{importance}} is the speech Against Agoratus (388 BC), {{one of our}} chief authorities for the internal history of Athens during the months which immediately followed; the defeat at Aegospotami. The Olympiacus (388 BC) is a brilliant fragment, expressing {{the spirit of the}} festival at Olympia, and exhorting Greeks to unite against their common foes. The Plea for the Constitution (403 BC) is interesting for {{the manner in which it}} argues that the well-being of Athens—now stripped of empire—is bound up with the maintenance of democratic principles. The speech For Mantitheus (392 BC) is a graceful and animated portrait, of a young Athenian hippeus, making a spirited defence of his honor against the charge of disloyalty. The defence For the Invalid is a humorous character-sketch. The speech Against Pancleon illustrates the intimate relations between Athens and Plataea, while <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> some picturesque glimpses of Athenian town life. The defence of the person who had, been charged with destroying a mona, or sacred olive, places us amidst the country life of Attica. And the speech Against Theomnestus deserves attention for its curious evidence of the way in which the ordinary vocabulary of Athens had changed between 600 and 400 BC.|$|E

[...] For the finale, Thomas promised [...] "80 percent total satisfaction. People will know who killed Lilly Kane. And there won't be that twist at the end that 'perhaps they didn't do it.'

Slay said, [...] "By setting the bar so high, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> reason to hope that the entire Gateway Mall will eventually fulfill the dreams that civic planners have had for it {{for the better part of}} a century. The Mall can be a wonderful, multi-faceted cultural and recreational space for our City and the region." ...|$|E
500|$|Wolfenstein: The New Order only {{features}} a single-player mode. The team felt that dividing focus and resources across both a single-player and an online multiplayer mode {{would be less}} efficient. When questioned {{about the lack of}} an online multiplayer mode, Öjerfors explained that the decision was simple. [...] "If we could take every bit of energy and sweat the studio has and pour all that into the single-player campaign, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> the resources to make something very, very cool, compared to if we would also have to divert some of our resources to making multiplayer." [...] Executive producer Jerk Gustafsson attributed the choice to the style of game the team is familiar with, stating that MachineGames is [...] "a single-player studio".|$|E

500|$|Upon {{learning}} about the live telecast, the cast had mixed emotions. Sean Hayes, who plays Jack, was nervous about the episode and hoped there would be cue cards. Debra Messing (Grace) [...] "gasped loudly" [...] when {{it was revealed that}} the technical demands of live television would mean that Burrows would not be directing on the stage floor, but would be up in a booth instead. Messing noted that she had never done live television, but in regards to the live broadcast, said, [...] "It starts out our final season in a real special way." [...] Eric McCormack (Will) was intrigued about the idea and seemed to be ready for whatever happened; [...] "It keeps it interesting for us.

500|$|SFScope {{contributor}} Sarah Stegall {{believed the}} episode [...] "got us quickly {{back on track}} after last week's lackluster tale," [...] and called the killer revelation the greatest shock she has received on the series thus far. She continued {{that one of her}} favorite parts of the Peter-as-a-killer arc is being able to watch the emotional setbacks he is facing as a result of Fauxlivia's betrayal; she called it [...] "good characterization, and excellent acting". However, Stegall questioned why Massive Dynamic would build a machine known to be the destroyer of mankind. IGN columnist Ramsey Isler praised the writing staff because [...] "just when you think they might be stuck in old habits, they come up with new ideas and put a whole new perspective on old storylines and characters." [...] Isler continued that while [...] "'Reciprocity'" [...] isn't the most groundbreaking episode in the series, it does try a number of new ideas, and <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> one big new plot point that could change the tone {{of the rest of the}} season." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{executive}} producer Jeffrey Bell explained how the season would interact with Agent Carter saying, [...] "Agent Carter {{seems to be}} about SSR pre-S.H.I.E.L.D., but about the beginnings of something, and the basic values of that. S.H.I.E.L.D. got blown up last year and what Coulson always wanted was a return to basics, and <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> an opportunity to return {{to some of those}} core values and even physically, some of that SSR stuff has a way of finding its way into our show that could be cool. Anyway we can tie things together, we’re {{going to try to do}} it, but it is hard when the stories are 60 years apart." [...] Ultimately, the opening scene of [...] "Shadows" [...] serves as an introduction to the world of Agent Carter with the inclusion of Atwell as Carter, setting up characters and ideas for that series, including the then unconfirmed involvement of Howard Stark, who is mentioned in the scene, as well as Carter's belief in the need for [...] "a permanent unit during peacetime", which will lead to the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E

[...] Several scenes in [...] "Shadows" [...] and [...] "The Things We Bury" [...] are flashbacks featuring Peggy Carter which serve as an introduction to the world of Agent Carter, setting up characters and ideas for that series, including Carter's belief in the need for [...] "a permanent unit during peacetime", which will lead to the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D. The episode [...] "Making Friends and Influencing People" [...] names Hydra's ability to brainwash people as the Faustus Method, named for the character who appears, as Johann Fennhoff, in Agent Carter, played by Ralph Brown.|$|E

[...] was one that they wanted to answer in the fourth season. Tancharoen called the Inhumans [...] "a permanent part of our universe now", with Whedon adding, [...] "we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explore the metaphors of {{what it is like to}} be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] With the Inhumans film being removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule, the series had [...] "a little more freedom" [...] and were [...] "able to do a little bit more" [...] with the species, including the potential of introducing some of the [...] "classic" [...] Inhumans, though the series would focus less on Inhumans than the third season which saw [...] "a real significant Inhuman agenda story". It was not intended to be a spin-off of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. On the evolution of S.H.I.E.L.D. to featuring so many powered characters, Whedon said [...] "the dynamic in the world has changed. There was one person with powers, and then by The Avengers there were maybe six total ... now they're much more prevalent, so there's reaction from the public based on that." ...|$|E
500|$|The Mets won the National League East by [...] {{games in}} 1986, but the Phillies {{were the only}} team to post a winning record against them, {{including}} winning 7 of 9 at Veterans Stadium. On September 12, up by 22 games, the Mets came to Philadelphia for a three game weekend series needing one win to clinch the division. The Mets brought champagne to Philadelphia. Before the series, Mets manager Davey Johnson told the Associated Press, [...] "It will be nice to clinch in Philadelphia. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> a chance to beat the only team in our way...I have a nice warm feeling about this." [...] He told The Philadelphia Inquirer: [...] "For the fans...it would be nicer to clinch at home. But for the safety...and the livelihood of the players...it's better {{to do it on}} the road." [...] In the series opener, Mike Schmidt hit a three-run homer, Phillies rookie Bruce Ruffin out pitched the Mets' Dwight Gooden, and the Phillies won, 6–3. The Phillies won the second game of the series, 6–5; visiting Mets fans became unruly and damaged seats in the upper deck. One Mets fan was arrested after hitting two Philadelphia police officers. The Phillies completed the sweep by beating the Mets, 6–0, behind a shutout from Kevin Gross, drove in two runs with a fourth-inning triple. The Mets would clinch the division at Shea Stadium on September 17. After the season, the Phils' Schmidt won the National League MVP Award, ahead of the Mets' Gary Carter and Keith Hernandez who finished third and fourth.|$|E

500|$|Discussing {{the season}} finale, Tancharoen stated, [...] "This season, we've {{explored}} {{a lot of}} different themes: There's the notion of purpose.

[...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. This finale feels like the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We wanted to put a close to [...] story. We knew going into this season what our plan was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not just feel like victory—we like to get a victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different.

[...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we still have a lot of plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump lets you do is to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot and pick up a lot of new." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We’ve done it each season, so we just wanted to do it a little early ... we would’ve done [...] in episode 1 next year but what we wanted to do was tease" [...] things to come at the end of this season.|$|E
