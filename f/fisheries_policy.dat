This would be accompanied by a state-owned 'Public British Energy Company', a measure that the party hopes will keep consumer costs affordable. The party would also abandon catch quotas set by the EU's Common <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Policy</b> and establish 'no fishing zones' to ensure plentiful stocks.|$|E
5|$|Sea {{fishing is}} an {{important}} industry for Northern coastal towns. Major fishing ports include Fleetwood, Grimsby, Hull and Whitby. At its height, Grimsby was the largest fishing port in the world, but the Northern fishing industry suffered greatly {{from a series of}} events {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century: the Cod Wars with Iceland and establishment of the exclusive economic zone ended British access to rich North Atlantic fishing grounds, while the North Sea was badly overfished and the European Common <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Policy</b> put strict quotas on catches to protect the almost depleted stocks. Grimsby is now transitioning to the processing of imported seafood and to offshore wind to replace its fishing fleet.|$|E

40|$|The {{failure to}} {{understand}} fundamental economic issues {{lies at the}} core of problems with <b>fishery</b> <b>policy</b> and practice. <b>Fishery</b> <b>policy</b> is high-level strategic direction; fishery practice is the implementation of policy. Economics education and outreach can strengthen <b>fishery</b> <b>policy</b> and practice, but they are underutilized as an avenue of influence. The position of economics in fisheries can be understood as a value chain, in which a sequence of activities gives economic information greater added value than the sum the individual activities. The value chain is weakened by the inadequacy of data and by the delivery of education and outreach at levels insufficient to robustly affect policy and management actions. The three primary reasons for this weakness are inadequate investment, unappealing language, and limited exposure. I give examples of policy areas that would benefit from stronger education and outreach and discuss the benefits and costs of participating in these activities. <b>Fishery</b> <b>policy,</b> <b>fishery</b> management, service, economic education, outreach, value chain, Environmental Economics and Policy, Research Methods/ Statistical Methods, Teaching/Communication/Extension/Profession, Q 2,...|$|R
25|$|The Common <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Policy</b> {{has been}} argued by certain {{commentators}} to have had disastrous consequences for the environment. This view is contradicted by historical evidence revealing that fishing stocks have been in chronic decline {{over the last century}} as a result of intensive trawl fishing. According to scientific research published in 2010, the depletion of fishing stocks is a consequence of mismanagement long before the Common <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Policy</b> came into being, a statement illustrated by the fact that British catches have declined by 94% over the last 118 years. Nonetheless, the Common <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Policy</b> has continued the trend of ineffective fisheries management in European waters. Indeed, the Common <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Policy</b> has done little if anything to reverse the decline of European fish stocks.|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of innovative <b>fishery</b> <b>policies</b> in New Zealand has recently attracted international attention. The {{introduction of}} an ITQ system was {{premised on the}} notion of Crown ownership of fishery resources. Conflict has accompanied these policies as Maori people have challenged the government over ownership of fishery resources and declaimed the skewed impact of the <b>fishery</b> <b>policies.</b> This paper examines the source of these problems focussing particularly on the Treaty of Waitangi negotiated in 1840 between the Crown and heads of Maori tribes. The Treaty guaranteed to Maori the full, exclusive and undisturbed possession of their fisheries and other properties, guarantees which were until recently ignored. The Crown has subsequently ceded some authority over and ownership of fishery resources to Maori.

25|$|When the <b>fisheries</b> <b>policy</b> was {{originally}} {{set up the}} intention {{was to create a}} free trade area in fish and fish products with common rules. It was agreed that fishermen from any state should have access to all waters. An exception was made for the coastal strip, which was reserved for local fishermen who had traditionally fished those areas. A policy was created to assist modernisation of fishing vessels and on-shore installations.|$|E
25|$|EU {{legislation}} currently {{states that}} there are total allowable catches for each species, which are sub-divided between European Union member states, the intention {{of which is to}} conserve fish stocks. The individual countries then use this figure as a basis for quota allocation to individual fishermen or fishermens organisations. The quota rules however require that any fish which is caught outside quota allowances or below minimum landing size be discarded and that it is an offence for a fishing vessel to be carrying on board any fish for which it does not have a valid quota or which is outside regulated size limits. This is an example of discarding practice being driven by political considerations. Years after difficult negotiations between stakeholders and member states, the EU updated the Common <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Policy</b> and included in Article 15 the Landing Obligation (Discard ban). Until 2019 the law will be implemented progressively. The Landing Obligation does not allow the fisher to land bycatches, it is the obligation to do so. All species subject to an regulation like catch quotas or minimum sizes, have to be landed. However, these landings are not feasible for direct human consumption and are therefore expected {{to be used in the}} fishmeal industry. The reform of the Common <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Policy</b> is based on regulation formats in Norway and Iceland.|$|E
25|$|The waters {{surrounding}} Scotland {{are some}} of the richest in Europe. Fishing is an economic mainstay in parts of the North East of Scotland and along the west coast, with important fish markets in places such as Aberdeen and Mallaig. Fish and shellfish such as herring, crab, lobster, haddock and cod are landed at ports such as Peterhead, the biggest white fish port in Europe, Fraserburgh, the biggest shellfish port in Europe, Stornoway, Lerwick and Oban. There has been a large scale decrease in employment in the fishing industry within Scotland, due initially to the sacrifice of national fishing rights to the EEC on the UK's accession to the Common Market in the 1970s, and latterly to the historically low abundances of commercially valuable fish in the North Sea and parts of the North Atlantic. To rebuild stocks the EU's Common <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Policy</b> places restrictions on the total tonnage of catch that can be landed, on the days at sea allowed and on fishing gear that can be deployed. These measures have so far been unsuccessful.|$|E

To find answer to this question, this study analyzed the relationship {{and the role of}} stakeholders in the policy process from the viewpoint of "knowledge-interaction". Three successful cases on Japanese local fishery had been incorporated in this study are: (1) sandfish resource management in Akita Prefecture; (2) local HACCP at Shibetsu-cho in Hokkai-do; and (3) the brand-building of "SEKIAJI SEKISABA" at Saganoseki-cho in Oita Prefecture. Four common grounds for success were found {{in each of the three}} cases: (1) all cases included problem-solving process before to be successful; (2) all cases had the role of bridge persons among stakeholders; (3) prefectural government supported policy positively and devotedly; and (4) policy transcended as result of knowledge-sharing among stakeholders. Theoretical implications of this study are: (1) roles of prefectural government to facilitate knowledge-sharing; (2) concepts of 'knowledge interpretation' to interpret knowledge among stakeholders; and (3) roles of "knowledge interpreter" in policy process. Practical implications of this study are: (1) the effectiveness of the utilization of specific knowledge and (2) the practice of collaborative problem-solving...|$|R

40|$|The {{solution}} to the problem of over-fishing offered by catch-effort models is a reduction in capital invested. <b>Fishery</b> <b>policy,</b> both European and Italian, is constructed entirely on the basis of this idea.

Furthermore, evaluation of the tax burden for Italian sea-fishing firms raises various points on the basis of which present <b>fishery</b> <b>policy</b> is found wanting with respect to its own theoretical apparatus (catch-effort models). Subsidies for definitive withdrawal and equipment renewal are opportune but economic problems regarding the efficiency of equipment will emerge if fiscal pressure is too high: firms will tend to withdraw from the market rather than renew their equipment. Since the Italian fishing sector comes under strong fiscal pressure we conclude that taxes should be effectively reduced and co-ordination with structural aid improved.
