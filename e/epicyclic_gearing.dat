5|$|The bookwheel, in {{its most}} {{commonly}} seen form, was invented by Italian military engineer Agostino Ramelli in 1588, presented {{as one of the}} 195 designs in Le diverse et artificiose machine del Capitano Agostino Ramelli (The various and ingenious machines of Captain Agostino Ramelli). To ensure that the books remained at a constant angle, Ramelli incorporated an <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gearing</b> arrangement, a complex device that had only previously been used in astronomical clocks. Ramelli's design is unnecessarily elaborate, as he likely understood that gravity could have worked just as effectively (as it does with a Ferris wheel, invented centuries later), but the gearing system allowed him to display his mathematical prowess. While other people would go on to build bookwheels based on Ramelli's design, Ramelli did not in fact ever construct his own.|$|E
5|$|The first geared {{clock was}} invented in the 11th century by the Arab {{engineer}} Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia; it was a water clock that employed a complex gear train mechanism, including both segmental and <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gearing,</b> capable of transmitting high torque. The clock was unrivalled in its use of sophisticated complex gearing, until the mechanical clocks of the mid-14th century. Al-Muradi's clock also employed the use of mercury in its hydraulic linkages, which could function mechanical automata. Al-Muradi's work was known to scholars working under Alfonso X of Castile, hence the mechanism {{may have played a}} role in the development of the European mechanical clocks. Other monumental water clocks constructed by medieval Muslim engineers also employed complex gear trains and arrays of automata. Like the earlier Greeks and Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed a liquid-driven escapement mechanism which they employed in some of their water clocks. Heavy floats were used as weights and a constant-head system was used as an escapement mechanism, which was present in the hydraulic controls they used to make heavy floats descend at a slow and steady rate.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} kinematics, the torque distributions, {{and the power}} losses of <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gear</b> mechanisms based upon the concepts of fundamental geared entities and fundamental circuits. The kinematic characteristics of fundamental geared entity are applied to the overall speed ratio analysis of <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gear</b> mechanisms. It is shown that the overall speed ratio of an <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gear</b> mechanism can be symbolically {{expressed in terms of}} the speed ratios of its fundamental geared entities by decomposing an <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gear</b> mechanism into two subsystems and each subsystem into two subsystems until the lowest level subsystem contains only one fundamental geared entity.

The Antikythera mechanism, the first known mechanical computer, and the mechanical inventions of Archimedes are examples of early mechanical engineering. Some of Archimedes' inventions {{as well as the}} Antikythera mechanism required sophisticated knowledge of differential gearing or <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gearing,</b> two key principles in machine theory that helped design the gear trains of the Industrial Revolution, and are still widely used today in diverse fields such as robotics and automotive engineering.|$|E

40|$|To date, {{most of the}} multi-DOF (degree-of-freedom) <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gear</b> trains {{have been}} used as a series of one-DOF devices.

This paper presents a systematic methodology for the identification and enumeration of the kinematic structure of true multiDOF <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gear</b> trains. It has been shown that there exist no true two-DOF <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gear</b> trains with five or less links and, that there exist two nonisomorphic rotation graphs of six vertices and twenty nonisomorphic rotation graphs of seven vertices. An atlas of nonisomorphic displacement graphs which can be used to construct true two-DOF <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gear</b> trains with six and seven links has been developed.

50|$|<b>Epicyclic</b> <b>gears,</b> as in hub gears.|$|R
25|$|Internal gearing is {{so called}} {{because all the}} gears {{involved}} are hidden within a wheel hub. Hub gears work using internal planetary, or <b>epicyclic,</b> <b>gearing</b> which alters {{the speed of the}} hub casing and wheel relative to the speed of the drive sprocket. They have just a single chainring and a single rear sprocket, almost always with a straight chain path between the two. Hub gears are available with between 2 and 14 speeds; weight and price tend to increase with the number of gears. All the advertised speeds are available as distinct gear ratios controlled by a single shifter (except for some early 5-speed models which used two shifters). Hub gearing is often used for bicycles intended for city-riding and commuting.|$|E
25|$|The first water clocks {{to employ}} complex {{segmental}} and <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gearing</b> was invented earlier by the Arab engineer Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia c. 1000. His water clocks were driven by water wheels, as {{was also the}} case for several Chinese water clocks in the 11th century. Comparable water clocks were built in Damascus and Fez. The latter (Dar al-Magana) remains until today and its mechanism has been reconstructed. The first European clock to employ these complex gears was the astronomical clock created by Giovanni de Dondi in c. 1365. Like the Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed an escapement mechanism which they employed in some of their water clocks. The escapement mechanism was {{in the form of}} a constant-head system, while heavy floats were used as weights.|$|E

50|$|Most (if not all) IVTs {{result from}} the {{combination}} of a CVT with an <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gear</b> system with a fixed ratio. The combination of the fixed ratio of the <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gear</b> with a specific matching ratio in the CVT side results in zero output. For instance, consider a transmission with an <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gear</b> set to 1:−1 gear ratio; a 1:1 reverse gear. When the CVT side is set to 1:1 the two ratios add up to zero output. The IVT is always engaged, even during its zero output. When the CVT is set to higher values it operates conventionally, with increasing forward ratios.|$|R
2500|$|Work on {{the first}} Lanchester car had been started in 1895, {{significantly}} designed from first principles as a car, not a horseless carriage, and it ran on the public roads in February or March 1896. It had a single-cylinder 1306cc engine with the piston having two connecting rods to separate crankshafts and flywheels rotating in opposite directions giving very smooth running. A two-cylinder engine was fitted to the same chassis in 1897 and a second complete car was built alongside it. This led on to the first production cars in 1900, when six were made as demonstrators. These had two-cylinder, 4033cc, horizontal air-cooled engines, retaining the twin crankshaft design. Steering was by side lever not wheel. The gearbox used <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gearing.</b> The first cars were sold {{to the public in}} 1901. In 1902 Lanchester became the first company to market disc brakes to the public.

[...] Although probably leaving much to be desired, they completely fit the definition of a disc brake, and beat all others to market by many years.|$|E

The analysis is restricted to the optimization of gear train through load analysis of the gears, pinions and annulus including the sun and plant gears, and finding out the optimal load conditions for the gear train to perform effectively without leading to load failure. <b>Epicyclic</b> <b>Gear</b> Trains have been used in Industry for their many advantages which includes high torque capacity, comparatively smaller size, lower weight, improved efficiency and highly compact package, however there has not been a comprehensive study of its load bearing performance with respect to different parameters such as module, material, and power of the <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gear</b> trains [16] [17].

A simple methodology for the systematic design of the Ravigneaux-type <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gear</b> transmissions needs to be developed. First, fundamentals and gear-shifting of four-speed and six-speed epicyclic-type automatic transmissions are illustrated to establish the design requirements. Second, based on the kinematic nomographs of the corresponding basic gear ratios, a simple clutching-sequence method is proposed and illustrated.
