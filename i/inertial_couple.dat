40|$|A {{vibration}} control method based on energy migration is proposed to decrease vibration {{response of the}} flexible arm undergoing rigid motion. A type of vibration absorber is suggested and {{gives rise to the}} <b>inertial</b> <b>coupling</b> between the modes of the flexible arm and the absorber. By analyzing 1 [*]:[*] 2 internal resonance, it is proved that the internal resonance can be successfully created and the exchange of vibration energy is existent. Due to the <b>inertial</b> <b>coupling,</b> the damping enhancement effect is revealed. Via the <b>inertial</b> <b>coupling,</b> vibration energy of the flexible arm can be dissipated by not only the damping of the vibration absorber but also its own enhanced damping, thereby effectively decreasing vibration.

A torsional motion in a building results from a possible aerodynamic and/or <b>inertial</b> <b>coupling</b> in various degrees of freedom. If the resultant wind forces do not coincide with the centre of mass at each floor level, an eccentric loading pattern can be expected which is responsible for exciting the torsional mode of vibration.

40|$|There is {{relative}} motion and <b>inertial</b> <b>coupling</b> between solids and fluids during seismic and acoustic propagation in rocks with fluids. This <b>inertial</b> <b>coupling</b> is anisotropic {{because of the}} microvelocity anisotropy of the fluid relative to solid in an anisotropic medium. The Biot mechanism and the squirt-flow mechanism {{are the two most}} important mechanisms of solid/fluid interaction in rocks. We extend the Biot/squirt (BISQ) theory to include the solid/fluid coupling anisotropy and develop a general poroelastic wave equation including both mechanisms simultaneously. The new model estimates velocity/frequency dispersion and attenuation of waves propagating in the 2 D PTL (periodic thin layers) +EDA (extensive dilatancy anisotropy) medium with fluids. The attenuation and dispersion of the two quasi-P-waves and the quasi-SV-wave, which are related to the solid/fluid coupling density and the permeability tensors, are anisotropic. The anisotropy are simultaneously affected by the anisotropies of the solid skeleton, the permeability, and the solid/fluid coupling effect of the formation. Numerical modeling suggests that variations of attenuation of both the fast quasi-P-wave and the quasi-SV-wave strongly depend on the permeability anisotropy. In the low-frequency range, the maximum attenuation is {{in the direction of the}} maximum permeability for the fast quasi-P-wave and in the direction of the minimum permeability for the quasi-SV-wave.
