The pilot follows AJ, whose new job {{during the summer}} drives <b>him</b> <b>crazy</b> with power. It is loosely based on Jones' 2006 film, AJ Goes to France. Both the film and the pilot star AJ Thompson as the eponymous character. Jones additionally sought inspiration from his hometown of Fargo, North Dakota, and the comics he drew featuring Thompson and his other friends. The pilot was released on the official website of Cartoon Network on May 16, 2014.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, [...] "Don't Lose My Number", {{a single}} that Collins only {{released}} in the US, peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 charts during late September 1985, and the B-side of the single was [...] "We Said Hello Goodbye". Collins had difficulty conceptualising a plot for the corresponding music video. He decided to create a gag video based on this difficulty. In the video, he talks to clients and directors, all giving <b>him</b> <b>crazy</b> conceptual ideas. Collins parodies several other videos, including those by Michael Jackson, David Lee Roth, Elton John, The Cars, and The Police. The singer also filmed parodies of Mad Max, western films, and samurai movies.|$|E

I said, 'Ah, I love this song,' and Max was like, 'If they would just write a damn pop chorus on it!' It was driving him nuts, because that indie song was sort of on six, going to seven, going to eight, the chorus comes ... and it goes back down to five. It drove <b>him</b> <b>crazy.</b> And when he said that, it was like, light bulb. 'Why don't we do that, but put a big chorus on it?' It worked." ...|$|E

Because he's done that, and it’s not working out for him, it’s driving <b>him</b> <b>crazy.</b> So we really wanted to show that he’s a tragic figure much more than a villainous figure. It’s just a series of unfortunate {{situations}} that have led to him slowly losing himself in this world. Popping back in time and showing his concern for Rick and how he cares for Lori and Carl, I thought {{that would be a good}} thing to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most sources {{question}} whether Crazy Horse was ever photographed. Dr. McGillycuddy doubted any {{photograph of the}} war leader had been taken.

2500|$|Released in July 2008, The Dark Knight broke several {{box office}} records and {{received}} both popular and critical accolades, {{especially with regard}} to Ledger's performance as the Joker. Even film critic David Denby, who does not praise the film overall in his pre-release review in The New Yorker, evaluates Ledger's work highly, describing his performance as both [...] "sinister and frightening" [...] and Ledger as [...] "mesmerising in every scene", concluding: [...] "His performance is a heroic, unsettling final act: this young actor looked into the abyss." [...] Attempting to dispel widespread speculations that Ledger's performance as the Joker had in any way led to his death (as Denby and others suggest), Ledger's co-star and friend Christian Bale, who played opposite him as Batman, has stressed that, as an actor, Ledger greatly enjoyed meeting the challenges of creating that role, an experience that Ledger himself described as [...] "the most fun I've ever had, or probably ever will have, playing a character." [...] Terry Gilliam also refuted the claims that playing the Joker made <b>him</b> <b>crazy,</b> calling it [...] "absolute nonsense" [...] and going on to say, [...] "Heath was so solid. His feet were on the ground and he was the least neurotic person I've ever met." ...|$|E

Little Big Man, standing behind <b>him,</b> seized <b>Crazy</b> Horse by both elbows, pulling his arms up behind <b>him.</b> As <b>Crazy</b> Horse struggled, Little Big Man lost his grip on one elbow, and Crazy Horse drove his own knife deep into his own lower back.
