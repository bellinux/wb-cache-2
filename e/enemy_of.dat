50|$|The Islamic Curriculum draws heavily {{upon the}} Quranic verses {{and traditions of}} the Prophet to expose ISIS and other militant groups who have {{absolutely}} no authority or legitimacy for setting up an Islamic State. According to the curriculum, ISIS and other militant groups {{have nothing to do}} with Islam and Islam also curses those people who kill the innocent with no reason.

50|$|Very few <b>of</b> the <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> the Enlightenment, however, have {{abandoned}} reason entirely. The battle {{has been over}} the scope, meaning and application of reason, not over whether it is good or bad, desirable or undesirable, essential or inessential per se. The conflict between the Enlightenment and the Counter-Enlightenment is not a conflict between friends and <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> reason, {{any more than it}} is between friends and <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> the notion of enlightenment.|$|R

Leopold was an <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> Louis XIV, James and Mary's patron.|$|E

5|$|Although Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, was {{of royal}} blood, he was {{commonly}} {{viewed as a}} criminal, prone to violence and stupidity. A proven <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> the Nevilles, Exeter bore a grudge particularly against Warwick for displacing him from his hereditary role of Lord High Admiral in 1457. Nonetheless, when Warwick joined the Lancastrians, Exeter obeyed Margaret and served under the Earl during the invasion of England. Although he supported the Lancastrian cause, Exeter had family ties to the House of York; he was husband to Anne of York, Edward's sister.|$|E
60|$|Nathan {{the prophet}} said that David's conduct {{would be open}} to this very interpretation, and would give great {{occasion}} to the <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> the Lord to blaspheme. But I trust that none of you wish to be numbered among the <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> the Lord.|$|R

50|$|Podkulachnik is {{considered}} by many to be a Stalinist neologism from the late 1920s. After the Russian Revolution, the Kulaks - relatively affluent and well-endowed peasants - were persecuted by the Soviet Government as class <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> the poor, and hence <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> the Revolution itself.|$|R
5|$|Andrew {{returned}} to Hungary {{at the beginning}} of 1290.

Before Andrew was successful, Arnold Hahót, an <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> the Kőszegis, invited him to the fort of Štrigova and captured him.

5|$|As {{a result}} of this attack, a 4-inch Mark III QF gun was erected on a {{promontory}} overlooking Village Bay, but it never saw action against the <b>enemy.</b> <b>Of</b> greater long-term significance to the islanders were the introduction of regular {{contact with the outside world}} and the slow development of a money-based economy. This made life easier for the St Kildans but also made them less self-reliant. Both were factors in the evacuation of the island little more than a decade later.|$|E
50|$|Gargamel {{has also}} worked with other <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> the Smurfs, {{although}} in many cases these other villains, such as Lord Balthazar, prove {{to be much more}} efficient and focused <b>enemies</b> <b>of</b> the Smurfs, and even so much as to smash their alliance with Gargamel and enslave him.|$|R

5|$|Furthermore, {{after the}} emperor showed Shahrbaraz intercepted letters from Khosrow {{ordering}} the Persian general's death, the latter switched to Heraclius' side. Shahrbaraz then moved his army to northern Syria, {{where he could}} easily decide to support either Khosrow or Heraclius at a moment's notice. Still, with the neutralization of Khosrow's most skilled general, Heraclius deprived his <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> {{some of his best}} and most experienced troops, while securing his flanks prior to his invasion of Persia.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, German anti-Semitic theorist Alfred Rosenberg in {{his primary}} {{contribution}} to Nazi theory on Zionism, Der Staatsfeindliche Zionismus ("Zionism, the <b>Enemy</b> <b>of</b> the State"), accused German Zionists {{of working for}} a German defeat and supporting Britain and {{the implementation of the}} Balfour Declaration, in a version of the stab-in-the-back myth. Adolf Hitler took a similar approach in some of his speeches from 1920 onwards.|$|E
