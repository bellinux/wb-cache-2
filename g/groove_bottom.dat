The initial damages of MDG locate at grating ridges while the damages with micro-holes and cracks appear in the <b>groove</b> <b>bottom.</b> Compared with the melted-hole damages of grating ridges, the <b>groove</b> <b>bottom</b> crack damages indicate they are the major promoting role of causing the catastrophic damage for MDG. The damage mechanism and development were discussed combined with the grating structure and the normalized electric field intensity (NEFI). The profile of <b>groove</b> <b>bottom</b> of MDG was explored by atomic force microscope (AFM) in detail. It is found that the bottom shape is arched with the maximum height of 30 nm. Based on these measuring grating parameters, NEFI of MDG was numerically calculated with finite difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm to explain the damage phenomenon. The arched bottom makes an enhancement of NEFI maximum in <b>groove</b> <b>bottom,</b> thereby increasing the risk of catastrophic damage for MDG.

Surprisingly, spill-out also significantly increases the plasmonic absorption for few-nanometer gaps and lowers the reflectance from arrays of ultrasharp metal grooves.

The research objective is to understand the micro grindability of various hard and brittle materials including quartz glass, silicon, SiC ceramics and WC alloy. First, a CNC mutual-wear truing approach was developed to sharpen the wheel V-tip; then, the wheel V-tip was employed to pattern the micro pyramidal array on workpiece surface along CNC tool paths; finally, the machined micro-structured surface and its form accuracy and aspect ratio were investigated. It is shown that this CNC mutual-wear truing approach can not only produce a V-shaped diamond grinding wheel, but also sharpen the diamond grain edges on the wheel V-tip. This wheel V-tip {{may be used to}} machine the micron-scale pyramid arrays on silicon, SiC ceramics and WC alloy surfaces with CNC level reticulated cross tool paths, the depth of cut of 1 µm and on-machine V-tip form-truing process. Although the average form error of machined micro-structured surface is very small, its pyramidal tops and <b>groove</b> <b>bottoms</b> appear very large form errors, which are dominated by the wheel V-tip sharpness and the grinding conditions, respectively.

In generally the photolithography technology used in semiconductor manufacturing {{is used to}} manufacture micro-channel chip Si-dies. However, this technology requires many processes, such as mask fabrication {{and the application of}} photoresist to a substrate as well as expensive clean room facilities. A micro-channel chip has a micro-groove 30 – 100 µm wide. This study examined how to form a fine groove by cutting with a micro-endmill, with the aim of shortening the window time and reducing the cost. This steel die requires high accuracy, for example, a burr area ratio of not more than 5 % of the <b>groove</b> <b>bottom</b> area, a surface roughness of the side and bottom faces of less than 1 µmRz, and a change in the sectional area of less than 1 %. So, this study examines micro-endmill’s cutting conditions, for example cutting speed, feed per tooth, and axial depth of cut. In MQL (minimum quantity of lubricant) cutting, the early fracture occurs when cutting was began. The cause has bad removing of the chips in MQL cutting, it is considered that the chips of hardened work have been re-cut as the result. Therefore, this study applied ultrasonic cavitation to milling, in order to solve this subject. This report experimentally examined the cutting performance of ultrasonic cavitation-assisted milling. We obtained the following results. In cutting distance of 20 m, the burr of MQL cutting is generated more than 5 %, on the other hand, the burr of ultrasonic cavitation-assisted milling is less than that.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{literature review}} {{on the development}} of AJM technology and the associated sciences has been conducted and presented. Although AJM is a promising technology for micromachining, it has been found that most studies in this field have been oriented towards high-pressure abrasive waterjet (AWJ) cutting, while little {{attention has been paid to}} micromachining using low-pressure jets with air as the jet fluid. The work in this thesis is aimed to address some of the issues identified with a specific objective of gaining a further and deeper understanding of the machining process and process performance and developing machining performance models for micro-grooving with low pressure abrasive air jets. An experimental study on the abrasive jet micromachining process using low-pressure air jets has been carried out to understand the relationship between the process parameters (i. e. nozzle diameter, air pressure, abrasive mass flowrate, jet impact angle, nozzle traverse speed) and major cutting performance measures (i. e. groove depth and width, kerf taper angle and roughness of the <b>groove</b> <b>bottom</b> surface). It has been found that increasing the air pressure increases the groove depth and width and decreases the kerf taper angle, while abrasive mass flowrate does not have a significant effect on the groove depth and width and the surface roughness. In addition, it is revealed that the maximum jet penetration occurs at near orthogonal jet impact angles. The effects of the process parameters on the various major cutting performance measures have thus been amply studied with the significance of each parameter identified by a statistical analysis. Recommendations are then made for the selection of process variables for micromachining of quartz crystals. Predictive models for the major cutting performance measures, which are essential for the optimisation of the micromachining process, are developed based on dimensional and statistical analysis. The developed models relate the major performance measures to the process parameters in abrasive micro-jet grooving, and have been verified by comparing their predictions with the data from a separate experiment. The assessments of the predicted models show that the developed models have been correctly formulated and can give adequate prediction of the cutting performance...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{maximize}} the film stiffness of dry gas seal, and keep a low leakage rate at the same time, {{a great deal of}} numerical and experimental study on groove structure and parameter optimization of DGS under varying operation conditions have been carried out. The effect of geometry parameters of groove, such as spiral angle, groove-dam ratio and groove depth, on the performance of a S-DGS, such as opening force, film stiffness, leakage rate and stiffness-leakage ratio, are numerically analyzed by Zirkelback et al. [8], Liu et al. [9], Peng et al. [10]. The optimum structural parameters of groove with different objective functions in different operating conditions are presented. In recent years, the effect of groove structural optimization on performance improvement of DGS has attracted more and more researchers’ attention because the limitation of performance enhancement by optimum design of groove geometry parameters of S-DGS simply. Recently, a parametric study and performance evaluation of typical bidirectional dry gas seals with modified surface were presented by Su et al. [11, 12] and Blasiaka and Zahorulko [13]. Hashimoto and Ochiai [14 – 16] presented an entirely new optimum design methodology, in which the groove geometry can be flexibly changed by using the spline function, {{to maximize the}} stiffness of gas films for grooved thrust bearings. The film stiffness and load-capacity of the optimized bearing are higher than that of common spiral groove bearing and herringbone bearing, which were both theoretically and experimentally verified. The sealing performance of the spiral groove DGS with an inner annular groove (AS-DGS) [17] was numerically analyzed by Peng et al. [18], which was invented by Flowserve Corporation. The results show that the opening force and film stiffness of AS-DGS is larger than that of the common S-DGS at the condition of low-speed and high-pressure, while the leakage is a little larger. Dresser-Rand Corporation presented a patented pattern of short grooves in combination with the longer grooves to provide excellent lift-off effect and optimum gas film stiffness at low speed as well as high speed. During operation, the short grooves could create obvious high pressure to separate the mating rings at slow speed, while the longer grooves contribute to creating a stable gas film between the two rings at high speed. The uni-directional V groove with the combined radial-circumferential tapered <b>groove</b> <b>bottom</b> [19], which was invented by Burgmann Corporation, causes a reduction in the opening force and leakage rate. Despite that there are only few researchers pay attention to the experiment of the sealing performance test of DGS, most of the researchers only focus on the numerical simulation and analysis of groove structure and geometry parameters optimization as the subject to improve the gas film stiffness and reduce the fluid leakage of DGS.|$|E
40|$|The Genesis spacecraft, {{launched}} in 2001, traveled to a Lagrangian point between the Earth and Sun to collect particles from {{the solar wind}} and return them to Earth. However, during {{the return of the}} spacecraft in 2004, the parachute failed to open during descent, and the Genesis spacecraft crashed into the Utah desert. Many of the solar wind collectors were broken into smaller pieces, and the field team rapidly collected the capsule and collector pieces for later assessment. On each of the next few days, the team discovered that various collectors had survived intact, including three of four concentrator targets. Within a month, the team had imaged more than 10, 000 fragments and packed them for transport to the Astromaterials Acquisition and Curation Office within the ARES Directorate at JSC. Currently, the Genesis samples are curated along with the other extraterrestrial sample collections within ARES. Although they were broken and dirty, the Genesis solar wind collectors still offered the science community the opportunity to better understand our Sun and the solar system as a whole. One of the more highly prized concentrator collectors survived the crash almost completely intact. The Genesis Concentrator was designed to concentrate the solar wind by a factor of at least 20 so that solar oxygen and nitrogen isotopes could be measured. One of these materials was the Diamond-on-Silicon (DoS) concentrator target. Unfortunately, the DoS concentrator broke on impact. Nevertheless, the scientific value of the DoS concentrator target was high. The Genesis Allocation Committee received a request for approximately 1 cm(sup 2) of the DoS specimen taken near {{the focal point of the}} concentrator for the analysis of solar wind nitrogen isotopes. The largest fragment, Genesis sample 60000, was designated for this allocation and needed to be precisely cut. The requirement was to subdivide the designated sample in a manner that prevented contamination of the sample and minimized the risk of losing or breaking the precious requested sample fragment. The Genesis curator determined that the use of laser scribing techniques to "cut" a precise line and subsequently cleave the sample (in a controlled break of the sample along that line) was the best method for accomplishing the sample subdivision. However, there were risks, including excess heating of the sample, that could cause some of the implanted solar wind to be lost via thermal diffusion. Accidentally breaking the sample during the handling and cleaving process was an additional risk. Early in fiscal year 2013, to address this delicate, complicated task, the ARES Directorate assembled its top scientists to develop a cutting plan that would ensure success when applied to the actual concentrator target wafer; i. e., to produce an approximately 1 cm(sup 2) piece from the requested area of the wafer. The team, subsequently referred to as the JSC Genesis Tiger Team, spent months researching and testing parameters and techniques related to scribing, cleaving, transporting, handling, and holding (i. e., mounting) the specimen. The investigation required considerable "thinking outside the box," and many, many trials using nonflight wafer analogs. After all preliminary testing, the following method was adopted as the final cutting plan. It was used in two final end-to-end practice runs before being used on the actual flight target wafer. The wafer was oriented on the laser cutting stage with the 100 and 010 directions of the wafer parallel to the corresponding X and Y directions of the cutting stage. The laser was programed to scribe 31 lines of the appropriate length along the Y stage direction. The programed scribe lines were separated by 5 micron in the X direction. The laser parameters were set as follows: (1) The laser power was 0. 5 watts; (2) each line consisted of 50 passes, with the Z position being advanced 5 micron per pass; and (3) 30 s would elapse before the next line was scribed to allow for wafer cool down from any possible heating via the laser. The ablated material that "stuck" in the "scribe-cut" was removed from the "cut" using an ultrasonic micro-tool. After all the ablated silicon was removed from the wafer, the wafer was repositioned in exactly the same orientation on the laser stage. The laser was focused using the bottom of the wafer channel, and the 31 -line scribing pattern described above was reprogrammed using the Z position of the <b>groove</b> <b>bottom</b> as the starting Z value instead of the top wafer surface, which was used previously. Upon completion of the second set of scribes, the ultrasonic micro-tool was again used to clean out the cut. The wafer was remounted on the stage in exactly the same orientation as before. The laser was again focused on the bottom of the groove. This time, however, the laser was. programed to scribe only one line down the exact center of the channel. The final scribe line consisted of 100 passes with a Z advance of 5 micron per pass and with the laser power set at 0. 5 watts. As mentioned above, the final cutting plan was practiced in two end-to-end trials using non-flight, triangular-shaped silicon wafers similar in size and orientation to the actual DOS 60000 target sample. The actual scribing of the triangular-shaped wafers required scribing two lines and cleaving (i. e. scribe-cleave, then scribe-cleave) to obtain the piece requested for allocation. Early in December 2012, after many months of experiments and practicing and perfecting the techniques and procedures, the team successfully subdivided the Genesis DoS 60000 target sample, one of the most scientifically important samples from the Genesis mission (figure 2). On December 17, 2012, the allocated piece of concentrator target sample was delivered to the requesting principal investigator. The cutting plan developed for the subdivision of this sample will be used as the model for subdividing future requested Genesis flight wafers (appropriately modified for different wafer types) ...|$|E
