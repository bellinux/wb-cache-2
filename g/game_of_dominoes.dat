25|$|Miss Lucilla Edith Cavell Teatime is a ladylike conwoman whose {{occasional}} lapses into verbal vulgarity {{make her}} all the more endearing. She has a liking for whisky, a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>dominoes</b> and all things tasteful. She first steps off the train in Flaxborough (a town once described as having the fictional solidarity of Arnold Bennett's Five Towns) in the fourth mystery set there, Lonelyheart 4122. She likes the town {{so much that she}} settles there, even though her attempt at swindling through a lonely-hearts bureau nearly makes her the third woman killed by another swindler. She appears in all subsequent Flaxborough novels except Blue Murder. By the eleventh volume, Plaster Sinners, she is the proprietress of the 'House of Yesteryear' in Northgate, Flaxborough, and a regular attender at local auctions. Her old talents and sleight of hand remain much in evidence. On one occasion two glass decanters are rendered extremely cheap when she casually transfers the stoppers to a tray of miscellaneous items, which she then bids for as well. Her final appearance is in Whatever's Been Going On At Mumblesby? where we find her with an assistant called Edgar and offering opinions on the marketability of such religious relics as saints' kneecaps. In the 1977 Murder Most English BBC television series, which offered adaptations of four of Colin Watson's Flaxborough novels, Lucy Teatime was portrayed by Brenda Bruce.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we give a {{combinatorial}} formalization {{that describes}} {{a wide range}} of related problems in the theory of tiling derived from the popular <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>dominos.</b> We show that determining if a given finite region of the plane can be tiled with a given set <b>of</b> <b>dominos</b> is NP-Complete. The new graph theoretical methods we introduce allow this result to be easily generalized to a variety of similar tiling problems. Several subproblems of the graph theoretical version of the problem are explored in depth. We then apply these methods to infinite tiling problems t...|$|R
60|$|They {{were all}} sitting round the table: two men intent upon their <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>dominoes,</b> {{the other two}} {{watching}} with equal intentness. Rondeau came shuffling out of the antichambre. His face, by {{the dim light of}} the oil lamp, looked jaundiced with fear.|$|E

40|$|In this contribution, {{we present}} {{the concept of}} Wang Tiles as a {{surrogate}} of the periodic unit cell method (PUC) for modelling of materials with heterogeneous microstructures and for synthesis of micro-mechanical fields. The concept {{is based on a}} set of specifically designed cells that compresses the stochastic microstructure into a small set of statistical volume elements – tiles. Tiles are placed side by side according to matching edges like in a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>domino.</b> Opposite to the repeating pattern of PUC the Wang Tiles method with the stochastic tiling algorithm preserves the randomness for reconstructed microstructures. The same process is applied to obtain the micro-mechanical response of domains where the evaluation as one piece would be time consuming. Therefore the micro-mechanical quantities are evaluated only on tiles (with surrounding layers of tiles of each addressed tile included into the evaluation) and then synthesized to the micro-mechanical field of whole domain...|$|R
60|$|In {{the hall}} some half-dozen men were {{nominally}} on guard--nominally, because discipline was not over strict these days, {{and the men}} sat or lolled about the place; {{two of them were}} intent on a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>dominoes,</b> another was watching them, whilst the other three were settling some sort of quarrel among themselves which necessitated vigorous and emphatic gestures and the copious use of expletives. One man, who appeared to be in command, divided his time impartially between the domino-players and those who were quarrelling.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Jellyband had {{appealed to}} the company in general, who were {{listening}} awe-struck and open-mouthed at the recital of Mr. Peppercorn's defalcations. At one table two customers--gentlemen apparently by their clothes--had pushed aside their half-finished <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>dominoes,</b> and had been listening for some time, and evidently with much amusement at Mr. Jellyband's international opinions. One of them now, with a quiet, sarcastic smile still lurking round {{the corners of his}} mobile mouth, turned towards the centre of the room where Mr. Jellyband was standing.|$|E
60|$|Mary Louise did {{not know}} how to combat this mood. She {{remained}} silent until Josie was dressed and the two went down to dinner. Their visitor was no longer the type of a half ignorant, half shrewd sewing-girl, such as she had appeared to be while in the village. Her auburn hair was now tastefully arranged and her attire modest and neat. She talked entertainingly during dinner, enlivening her companions thereby, and afterward played a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>dominoes</b> with the Colonel in the living-room, permitting him to beat her at this, his favorite diversion.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{the park was}} an empty city lot with many tall trees, very few bushes and shrubbery, and some open semi-grassy areas. Senior {{citizens}} of the area gravitated to the empty lot in the afternoons for its comfortable shade and for the inevitable conversations with other retired neighborhood seniors. With time, the senior {{made their way to}} the park with scrap chairs to make their longer stays more comfortable. It wasn't long before a table or two also found their way there, making it possible for the retired seniors to share in a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>domino.</b> Soon the domino games became a regular feature of the daily gatherings. It was not long before the still-empty government lot had been [...] "appropriated" [...] by the seniors for their daily gatherings and domino games. The daily games gathered popularity and after a few years domino tournaments also took place. At this time the park was locally known as Las Vegas, [...] "for its popular open-air kiosks with 12 game tables".|$|R
25|$|Besides playing <b>games,</b> {{another use}} <b>of</b> <b>dominoes</b> is the domino show, which {{involves}} standing them on end in long lines {{so that when}} the first tile is toppled, it topples the second, which topples the third, etc., resulting in all of the tiles falling. By analogy, the phenomenon of small events causing similar events leading to eventual catastrophe is called the domino effect.|$|R

60|$|There was {{a general}} commotion in the coffee-room. Everyone was curious to see my Lord Antony's swell friends from over the water. Miss Sally cast one or two quick glances at {{the little bit of}} mirror which hung on the wall, and worthy Mr. Jellyband bustled out in order to give the first welcome himself to his {{distinguished}} guests.

"They {{played a}} <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>dominoes</b> together, sitting in chairs {{opposite}} each other, {{and touched the}} dominoes that were wanted; but the man placed them and kept telling how the game went. Lyda was beaten, and hid under the sofa, evidently feeling very badly about it. Blanche was then surrounded with playing-cards, while her master held another pack and told us to choose a card; then he asked her what one had been chosen, and she always took up the right one in her teeth. I was asked to go into another room, put a light {{on the floor with}} cards round it, and leave the doors nearly shut. Then the man begged some one to whisper in the dog's ear what card she was to bring, and she went at once and fetched it, thus showing that she understood their names. Lyda did many tricks with the numbers, so curious that no dog could possibly understand them; yet what the secret sign was I could not discover, but suppose it must have been in the tones of the master's voice, for he certainly made none with either head or hands.|$|E
60|$|Between {{us there}} was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of the sea. Besides holding our hearts {{together}} through {{long periods of}} separation, it {{had the effect of}} making us tolerant of each other's yarns--and even convictions. The Lawyer--the best of old fellows--had, because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck, and was lying on the only rug. The Accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He had sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect, and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an idol. The Director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way aft and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards there was silence on board the yacht. For some reason or other we did not begin that <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>dominoes.</b> We felt meditative, and fit for nothing but placid staring. The day was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very mist on the Essex marshes was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds. Only the gloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more somber every minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun.|$|E

6000|$|At Mudie's {{corner in}} Oxford Street all {{the red and}} blue beads had run {{together}} on the string. The motor omnibuses were locked. Mr. Spalding going to the city looked at Mr. Charles Budgeon bound for Shepherd's Bush. The proximity of the omnibuses gave the outside passengers an opportunity to stare into each other's faces. Yet few took advantage of it. Each had his own business to think of. Each had his past shut in him like the leaves of a book known to him by heart; and his friends could only read the title, James Spalding, or Charles Budgeon, and the passengers going the opposite way could read nothing at all--save [...] "a man with a red moustache," [...] "a young man in grey smoking a pipe." [...] The October sunlight rested upon all {{these men and women}} sitting immobile; and little Johnnie Sturgeon took the chance to swing down the staircase, carrying his large mysterious parcel, and so dodging a zigzag course between the wheels he reached the pavement, started to whistle a tune and was soon out of sight--for ever. The omnibuses jerked on, and every single person felt relief at being a little nearer to his journey's end, though some cajoled themselves past the immediate engagement by promise of indulgence beyond--steak and kidney pudding, drink or a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>dominoes</b> in the smoky corner of a city restaurant. Oh yes, human life is very tolerable on the top of an omnibus in Holborn, when the policeman holds up his arm and the sun beats on your back, and {{if there is such a}} thing as a shell secreted by man to fit man himself here we find it, on the banks of the Thames, where the great streets join and St. Paul's Cathedral, like the volute on the top of the snail shell, finishes it off.

Did Madame ever hear the like of it?' concluded Jeanne, throwing up her hands to heaven. 'I am sorry to say, Jeanne, that I have,' replied my sweet Madame with a sigh, and led the conversation by slow degrees back to the subject of dinner. I turned to her when Jeanne had left the room. I can remember still the burning indignation of my face. I had often spoken to the man myself, and had thought what a delightful husband he was--so kind, so attentive, so proud, seemingly, of his dainty femme. 'Doesn't that prove what I say,' I cried, 'that men are beasts?' 'I am afraid it helps in that direction,' replied my old friend. 'And yet you defend them,' I answered. 'At my age, my dear,' she replied, 'one neither defends nor blames; one tries to understand.' She put her thin white hand upon my head. 'Shall we hear a little more of the story?' she said. 'It is not a pleasant one, but it may be useful to us.' 'I don't want to hear any more of it,' I answered; 'I have heard enough.' 'It is sometimes well,' she persisted, 'to hear the whole of a case before forming our judgment.' And she rang the bell for Jeanne. 'That story about our little grocer friend,' she said--'it is rather interesting to me. Why did he leave her and run away--do you know?' Jeanne shrugged her ample shoulders. 'Oh! the old story, Madame,' she answered, with a short laugh. 'Who was she?' asked my friend. 'The wife of Monsieur Savary, the wheelwright, as good a husband as ever a woman had. It's been going on for months, the hussy!' 'Thank you, that will do, Jeanne.' She turned again to me so soon as Jeanne had left the room. 'My dear,' she said, 'whenever I see a bad man, I peep round the corner for the woman. Whenever I see a bad woman, I follow her eyes; I know she is looking for her mate. Nature never makes odd samples.'" ...|$|E
