40|$|In this paper, a {{mathematical}} model is proposed and analyzed to study the removal by rain of two <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutants</b> and a particulate matter formed by these two reacting gases from the atmosphere. The atmosphere is assumed to consist of six phases i. e. the phase of raindrops, the two phases of <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutants,</b> their corresponding absorbed phases in raindrops and the phase of a particulate matter formed by these two chemically reacting <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutants.</b> The dynamics of these phases {{is assumed to be}} governed by the ordinary differential equations with source, nonlinear interaction, and removal terms. The proposed model is analyzed by using stability theory of differential equations and computer simulation. It is shown that under appropriate conditions, the pollutants can be removed from the atmosphere by rain significantly and the removed amount would depend upon the rates of discharges of <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutants,</b> the rate of formation of particulate matter and the intensity of rain.

40|$|We {{suggest a}} model of rain {{scavenging}} of soluble <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutants</b> in the atmosphere.

Calculations of scavenging coefficient and the rates of precipitation scavenging are performed for wet removal of ammonia (NH 3) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2) from the atmosphere.

40|$|In this paper, we have {{proposed}} a four-dimensional nonlinear mathematical model to see the effect of density of cloud droplets on the removal of <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutants</b> by rain in the atmosphere.

It is further assumed that these phases undergo ecological type growth and nonlinear interactions. The proposed model is analyzed by stability theory of differential equations and computer simulations.

The reason behind this {{is the presence of}} all <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutants</b> like CO, O 3, NO 2 and CH 4 in the atmosphere in varied levels. The rapid industrial and economic activities and the use of poor technologies in the developing countries cause discharge of these gases which lead to air pollution.

The study of the comparative presence of these gases in the three years 2012, 2013 and 2014 infers that CO concentration was higher in the year 2014 (0. 35 ppm), in the other hand O 3 and NO 2 concentration was greater in the year 2013 (55 ppb and 11. 45 ppb) whereas the concentration of CH 4 was higher in the year 2012 (2603 ppb) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We propose three {{estimation}} strategies (local, {{remote and}} mixed) for ultrafine particles (UFP) at three sites {{in an urban}} air pollution monitoring network. Estimates are obtained through Gaussian process regression based on concentrations of <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutants</b> (NOx, O 3, CO) and UFP. As local strategy, we use local measurements of <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutants</b> (local covariates) to estimate UFP at the same site. As remote strategy, we use measurements of <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutants</b> and UFP from two independent sites (remote covariates) to estimate UFP at a third site. As mixed strategy, we use local and remote covariates to estimate UFP. The results suggest: UFP can be estimated with good accuracy based on NOx measurements at the same location; {{it is possible to}} estimate UFP at one location based on measurements of NOx or UFP at two remote locations; the addition of remote UFP to local NOx, O 3 or CO measurements improves models' performance...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt is {{necessary}} to identify a <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutant</b> source rapidly so that prompt actions can be taken, {{but this is one}} of the difficulties in the inverse problem areas. In this paper, an approach to identifying a sudden continuous emission pollutant source based on single sensor information is developed to locate a source in an enclosed space with a steady velocity field. Because the gravity has a very important influence on the <b>gaseous</b> <b>pollutant</b> transport and the source identification, its influence is analyzed theoretically and a conclusion is drawn that the velocity of fluid is a key factor to effectively help weaken the gravitational influence. Further studies for a given 2 -D case by using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method show that when the velocity of inlet is less than one certain value, the influence of gravity on the pollutant transport is very significant, which will change the velocity field obviously. In order to quantitatively judge the practical applicability of identification approach, a synergy degree of the velocity fields before and after a source appearing is proposed as a condition for considering the influence of gravity. An experimental device simulating pollutant transmission was set up and some experiments were conducted to verify the practical application of the above studies in the actual gravitational environment. The results show that the proposed approach can successfully locate the sudden constant source when the experimental situations meet the identified conditions...|$|E
