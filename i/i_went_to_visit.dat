2500|$|Michael Morpurgo, {{the author}} of the book on which the film is based, visited the set several times while filming was being undertaken: [...] "Spielberg’s a {{wonderful}} storyteller and a kid. He adores stories and that’s what he’s best at. It’s extraordinary to meet someone with that kind of enthusiasm, utterly unspoiled ... When <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> him on set, he was clearly enthralled by the countryside. He fell for Devon in a big way. He was warm, kind and open, and utterly without ego ... Spielberg was like a conductor with a very light baton. He hardly had to wave it at all. I was in awe.” Emily Watson also praised Spielberg's approach: [...] "It was intimate, passionate and about the acting. And every single priority that as an actor that you would want to be there was there. It felt very real and focused." [...] On set, he'd come in, in the morning, and say, 'I couldn't sleep last night. I was worrying about this shot!' Which was great! He's human and he's still working in an impassioned way, like a 21-year-old, trying to make the best out of everything." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am a {{lady with}} a weak mind, Mr. Crawley, and always carry things of this sort about with me when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> children; so you must forgive me, and allow your little boy to accept them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Cromwell, [...] "I know thou canst manage such gear well--But, Gilbert, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> the posts, {{and give}} them orders to retire to a safe {{distance}} when the retreat is sounded. You will allow them five minutes for this purpose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I {{never cared}} for her much; and since <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> her father I have seen another girl who is far more beautiful; far more clever; more winning, in every way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Forester, [...] "I {{really went}} away nut of town. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> a sick man {{and help him}} make his will, and I did not return until just before you saw me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Well, one day <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> the [...] "Saint George's Orphanage for Girls," [...] in Capetown. I was {{conducted}} over the dormitories and schools, etcetera, {{and at last}} came to a class-room in which were assembled some hundred or so of black orphans--infants almost, most of them, and irresistibly comic in their little looks and actions.|$|E
60|$|You must know, that, {{some twenty}} years since, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> down <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> {{an old friend}} in Worcestershire, who had served with me in the---- Dragoons.|$|R
60|$|Now, when {{my mother}} got to be eighty-five years old her memory failed her. She forgot little threads that hold life's patches of meaning together. She was living out West then, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> on <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> her.|$|R
60|$|The day {{had become}} very sultry {{by the time}} <b>I</b> <b>went</b> out <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> my patients. The sky was {{overcast}} with dark thunderous clouds, and, as there seemed every chance of a heavy shower, I returned to my lodgings for an umbrella.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was in {{high spirits}} when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> my Amelia that evening, and I told her {{confidently}} that {{before the end of}} the year I expected to gain the gold medal of the Royal Society. The dear girl was pleased at my glowing prospects, and gave me every assurance of the delight with which she hailed the probability of our approaching union.|$|E
6000|$|... "My sister Nelly and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> an aunt of ours, when we {{were little}} girls, {{but we did n't have}} a very good time, for she was {{extremely}} strict. One afternoon, when she had gone out to tea, and old Debby, the maid, was asleep in her room, we sat on the doorstep, feeling homesick, and ready for any thing to amuse us.|$|E
60|$|Before {{nine o'clock}} {{she was in}} Cursitor Street, and once more joyfully bounced into her husband's arms; who woke up yawning and {{swearing}} somewhat, with a severe headache, occasioned by the jollification of the previous night: for, strange though it may seem, there are perhaps no places in Europe where jollity is more practised than in prisons for debt; and I declare for my own part (I mean, of course, that <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> a friend) I have dined at Mr. Aminadab's as sumptuously as at Long's.|$|E
5000|$|Wright, who was Barack Obama's former pastor, gained {{national}} attention {{when he was}} uninvited from giving a public invocation at Obama's February 10th, presidential announcement. Wright {{was still able to}} attend the event. In an interview he stated, [...] "“When his enemies find out that in 1984 <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Tripoli” <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, with Farrakhan, a lot of his Jewish support will dry up quicker than a snowball in hell.” ...|$|R
30|$|I {{was working}} in [names bank, which went bust in the crisis], the salary was good and the work was interesting, but I always knew I could achieve more… London is the closest {{financial}} centre and it’s in Europe, the others are in the US or Asia… I knew {{that in order to}} develop contacts I had to study at the London Business School... it’s expensive but it’s an entrance ticket… you have a network of course-mates and an important line in your CV… London is a very central place globally. My parents live in [names town in a remote region of Latvia], and if <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> them… Honestly, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> a wedding in Delhi recently and it was a faster trip than to [names Latvian town].|$|R
6000|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] I said, [...] "I {{am sorry}} for you. Had you lain still and listened, {{we should all}} have been the better and happier. But what you have done, you cannot undo. Kindly inform the night porter that <b>I</b> am <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> my uncle, the Cardinal Archbishop. Adieu!" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> an {{agreeable}} new acquaintance, Mr. Romayne. His wife {{drove up}} to the house while I was looking out of window. I recognized Stella! After two years, she has made use of the freedom which the law has given to her. I must not complain of that, or of her treating me like a stranger, when her husband innocently introduced us. But when are were afterward left together for a few minutes--no! I cannot write down the merciless words she said to me. Why am I fool enough to be as fond of her as ever? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{one degree}} too thick {{that was for}} me," [...] the young man confided, after he had given mysterious orders to his white-linened friend behind the bar. [...] "I am not putting on frills, mind. I was willing to come in on any scheme to induce you to part with a bit, but I didn't fancy the medieval touch and the black gentleman. Gad, you're a little terror, though, Pratt! I'd have given {{something}} to have seen you knock those two about! <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> Mason in hospital. You couldn't see his face for bandages."...|$|E
6000|$|It {{is not a}} {{very rare}} thing to find a farm-labourer like old Reed of Odstock, with not only a strong {{preference}} for a particular kind of work, but a love of it as compelling as that of an artist for his art. Some friends of mine whom <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> over the border in Dorset told me of an enthusiast of this description who had recently died in the village. [...] "What a pity you did not come sooner," [...] they said. Alas! it is nearly always so; on first coming to stay at a village one is told that it has but just lost its oldest and most interesting inhabitant--a relic of the olden time.|$|E
60|$|Away <b>went</b> Mr. Batterbury <b>to</b> {{finish his}} walk {{for the sake}} of his health, and away <b>went</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> my {{publisher}} {{for the sake of}} my pocket.|$|R
6000|$|She was too languid to be {{more than}} {{indifferent}} when she saw us, and the first sign of warmth that she gave was her kiss, when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> back <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> her after putting her to bed at the hotel. She looked up, put her arms round my neck, and said, [...] "This is like the old days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm glad to {{have such}} a good account of him from one so well able to judge," [...] rejoined her father, [...] "and as <b>I</b> mean <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>visit</b> him without delay I'll be obliged if you'll give me his address." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{weather in}} London was mild and clear. The third evening after I had got settled {{in one of}} those delightfully English hotels {{in the heart of the}} city, yet removed from the traffic, with letter-boxes that still bear the {{initials}} of Victoria, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> some American naval officers in their sitting-room on the ground floor. The cloth had not been removed from the dinner-table, around which we were chatting, when a certain strange sound reached our ears--a sound not to be identified with the distant roar of the motor-busses in Pall Mall, nor with the sharp bark of the taxi-horns, although not unlike them. We sat listening intently, and heard the sound again.|$|E
6000|$|... 182 “Goldsmith {{told us that}} he was now busy {{in writing}} a Natural [...] History; and that he might have full leisure for it, he had taken [...] lodgings at a farmer’s house, near to the six-mile stone in the [...] Edgeware Road, and had carried down his books in two {{returned}} [...] post-chaises.

Mr. Mickle, [...] the translator of the Lusiad, and <b>I,</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> him at this [...] place a few days afterwards.

6000|$|... 31. Dilly and I walked to-day to Kensington to Lady Mountjoy, {{who invited}} us to dinner. He {{returned}} soon, {{to go to a}} play, it being the last that will be acted for some time: he dresses himself like a beau, and no doubt makes a fine figure. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> some people at Kensington: Ophy Butler's wife(9) there lies very ill of an ague, which is a very common disease here, and little known in Ireland. I am apt to think we shall soon have a peace, by the little words I hear thrown out by the Ministry. I have just thought of a project to bite the town. I have told you that it is now known that Mr. Prior has been lately in France. I will make a printer of my own sit by me one day, and I will dictate to him a formal relation of Prior's journey,(10) with several particulars, all pure invention; and I doubt not but it will take.|$|E
5000|$|Meier {{attended}} Bullard High School in Fresno, California {{and then}} <b>went</b> on <b>to</b> attend Stanford University and Fresno City College.

[...] "He was tough, a real disciplinarian," [...] Meier told the Chicago Tribune in 1988. [...] "At that age we probably needed it. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> back <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> {{a few years}} later, and he was real nice. I thought, 'Is this the same guy?'" ...|$|R
60|$|We did {{not give}} {{ourselves}} up to sight-seeing as we had done at Chester, because now {{there was plenty of}} time to see London at our leisure. In the mornings I attended to my business, and in the afternoons Euphemia and <b>I</b> generally <b>went</b> out <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> some of the lions of the grand old city.|$|R
6000|$|We know nothing, to the regret of bibliophiles, of Moliere's {{taste in}} bindings. Did {{he have a}} comic mask stamped on the leather (that device was chased on his plate), or did he display his {{cognizance}} and arms, the two apes that support a shield charged with three mirrors of Truth? It is certain--La Bruyere tells us as much--that the sillier sort of book-lover {{in the seventeenth century}} was much the same sort of person as his successor in our own time. [...] "A man tells me he has a library," [...] says La Bruyere (De la Mode); [...] "I ask permission <b>to</b> see it. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> my friend, and he receives me in a house where, even on the stairs, the smell of the black morocco with which his books are covered is so strong that I nearly faint. He does his best to revive me; shouts in my ear that the volumes 'have gilt edges,' that they are 'elegantly tooled,' that they are 'of the good edition,' [...] . and informs me that 'he never reads,' that 'he never sets foot in this part of his house,' that he 'will come to oblige me!' I thank him for all his kindness, and have no more desire than himself to see the tanner's shop that he calls his library." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 13. I {{have left}} off Lady Kerry's bitter, and got another box of pills. I have no fits of giddiness, but only some little {{disorders}} towards it; and I walk {{as much as}} I can. Lady Kerry is just as I am, only a great deal worse: I dined to-day at Lord Shelburne's, where she is, and we con ailments, which makes us very fond of each other. I have taken Mr. Harley into favour again, and called to see him, {{but he was not}} within; I will use to visit him after dinner, for he dines too late for my head: then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> poor Congreve, who is just getting out of a severe fit of the gout; and I sat with him till near nine o'clock. He gave me a Tatler(9) he had written out, as blind as he is, for little Harrison. It is about a scoundrel that was grown rich, and went and bought a coat of arms at the Herald's, and a set of ancestors at Fleet Ditch; 'tis well enough, and shall be printed in two or three days, and if you read those kind of things, this will divert you. It is now between ten and eleven, and I am going to bed.|$|E
6000|$|... 5. Lady Masham has miscarried; but is well almost again. I {{have many}} visits to-day. I met Blith at the Duke of Ormond's; and he begged me {{to carry him}} to the Duchess of Hamilton, to beg her pardon again. I did on purpose {{to see how the}} blunderbuss behaved himself; but I begged the Duchess to use him mercifully, for she is the devil of a teaser. The good of it is, she ought to beg his pardon, for he meant no harm; yet she would not allow him to put in an {{advertisement}} to clear himself from hers, though hers was all a lie. He appealed to me, and I gravely gave it against him. I was at Court to-day, and the foreign Ministers have got a trick of employing me to speak for them to Lord Treasurer and Lord Bolingbroke; which I do when the case is reasonable. The College(11) need not fear; I will not be their Governor. I dined with Sir Thomas Hanmer and his Duchess.(12) The Duke of Ormond was there, but we parted soon, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> Lord Pembroke for the first time; but it was to see some curious books. Lord Cholmondeley(13) came in; but I would not talk to him, though he made many advances. I hate the scoundrel for all he is your Griffith's friend.--Yes, yes, I am abused enough, if that be all. Nite sollahs.|$|E
6000|$|... 24. This morning I {{recommended}} Newcomb {{again to}} the Duke of Ormond, and left Dick Stewart(4) to do it further. Then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> the Duchess of Hamilton, who was not awake. So I went to the Duchess of Shrewsbury, and sat an hour at her toilet. I talked to her about the Duke's being Lord Lieutenant. She said she knew nothing of it; but I rallied her out of that, and she resolves not to stay behind the Duke. I intend to recommend the Bishop of Clogher to her for an acquaintance. He will like her very well: she is, indeed, a most agreeable woman, and a great favourite of mine. I know not whether the ladies in Ireland will like her. I was at the Court of Requests, to get some lords {{to be at a}} committee to-morrow, about a friend's Bill: and then the Duke of Beaufort gave me a poem, finely bound in folio, printed at Stamford, and writ by a country squire. Lord Exeter(5) desired the Duke to give it the Queen, because the author is his friend; but the Duke desired I would let him know whether it was good for anything. I brought it home, and will return it to-morrow, as the dullest thing I ever read; and advise the Duke not to present it. I dined with Domville at his lodgings, by invitation; for he goes in a few days for Ireland. Nite dee MD.|$|E
5000|$|Coming from a {{small town}} with a {{population}} under 900, Henke admitted that he initially had to overcome a fear of big cities. [...] "I hated going to New York City", he said. [...] "I felt like a fish out of water there. I’d go from the hotel to Yankee Stadium and that's it. It took me two or three years before <b>I</b> <b>went</b> out <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> the Statue of Liberty and I never took the subway." [...] On living in Toronto, Henke said [...] "I rented an apartment downtown {{for two or three years}} and that wasn’t for me. I’m just a guy {{from a small}} town and that's where I’m most comfortable".|$|R
60|$|It chanced that on {{this day}} of Nada's death and at that same hour of dawn I, Mopo, came from my mission back to the kraal of the People of the Axe, having succeeded in my end, for that great chief whom <b>I</b> had <b>gone</b> out <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> had hearkened <b>to</b> my words. As the light broke I reached the town, and lo! it was a {{blackness}} and a desolation.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>gone</b> over <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> Annerly at his rooms. It was Saturday, October 31. I {{remember}} the date so {{precisely because it}} was my pay day, and I had received six sovereigns and ten shillings. I remembered the sum so exactly because I had put the money into my pocket, and I remember into which pocket I had put it because I had no money in any other pocket. My mind is perfectly clear on all these points.|$|R
