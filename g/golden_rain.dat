5|$|The {{golden jackal}} {{is both a}} {{predator}} and a scavenger, and an omnivorous and opportunistic forager with a diet that varies according to its habitat and the season. In Bharatpur, India, over 60% of its diet was measured to consist of rodents, birds, and fruit. In the Kanha Tiger Reserve, 80% of its diet consists of rodents, reptiles and fruit. Vegetable matter forms part of the jackal diet, and in India they feed intensively on the fruits of Buckthorn (Ziziphus), Dogbane (Carissa carvanda), Java plum (Syzygium cumini), and the pods of mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) and the <b>golden</b> <b>rain</b> tree Cassia fistula.|$|E
25|$|In Italy it {{is called}} Calendimaggio or cantar maggio a {{seasonal}} feast held to celebrate the arrival of spring. The event {{takes its name from}} the period in which it takes place, that is, the beginning of May, from the Latin calenda maia. The Calendimaggio is a tradition still alive today in many regions of Italy as an allegory of the return to life and rebirth: among these Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna (for example, is celebrated {{in the area of the}} Quattro Province or Piacenza, Pavia, Alessandria and Genoa), Tuscany and Umbria. This magical-propitiatory ritual is often performed during an almsgiving in which, in exchange for gifts (traditionally eggs, wine, food or sweets), the Maggi (or maggerini) sing auspicious verses to the inhabitants of the houses they visit. Throughout the Italian peninsula these Il Maggio couplets are very diverse—most are love songs with a strong romantic theme, that young people sang to celebrate the arrival of spring. Symbols of spring revival are the trees (alder, <b>golden</b> <b>rain)</b> and flowers (violets, roses), mentioned in the verses of the songs, and with which the maggerini adorn themselves. In particular the plant alder, which grows along the rivers, is considered the symbol of life and that's why it is often present in the ritual.|$|E

5000|$|Writing for Spin Caryn Ganz {{was pleased}} by the video, saying [...] "Madonna's attempt to find a bridge between sports, love, and fame falls a bit flat... but in the end, the {{football}} players and cheerleaders in the video are all literally faceless passersby. They, like the two high-profile MCs, are all here in service of singer." [...] Becky Bain Idolator found a number of topics to discuss about the video, including trick photography, <b>golden</b> <b>rains</b> {{and the appearance of}} the singers as [...] "triple Marilyn or triple Madonna". Though she believed that it was not Madonna's best video, nevertheless it was successful as a release. Christopher Farley from The Washington Post gave another positive review, saying that the singer [...] "appears to be in better shape than many college students, which is crazy" [...] and also complimented her for picking [...] "M.I.A. and Nicki Minaj-and getting them to literally serve as cheerleaders for the Madonna brand." [...] MTV News' Jocelyn Vena described it as [...] "funky, fun and surreal (and almost cartoony)" [...] as well as fun and light-hearted: [...] "Madonna looks like she's having an incredibly fun time throughout the visual, smiling and shimmying her way through this fictional, hyper-fantasy world. Watching the clip, one may wonder what doesn't happen in the video." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Tea at the Palaz of Hoon" [...] is a poem from Wallace Stevens's {{first book}} of poetry, Harmonium. It was first {{published}} in 1921, so it is in the public domain. [...] Not less because in purple I descended The western day through what you called The loneliest air, not less was I myself. What was the ointment sprinkled on my beard? What were the hymns that buzzed beside my ears? What was the sea whose tide swept through me there? Out of my mind the <b>golden</b> ointment <b>rained,</b> And my ears made the blowing hymns they heard. I was myself the compass of that sea: I was the world in which I walked, and what I saw Or heard or felt came not but from myself; And there I found myself more truly and more strange. This poem is central to Harold Bloom's reading of Stevens's Harmonium, as marking the poet's progress over the perspectivism of [...] "The Snow Man" [...] and the pessimism of [...] "The Man whose Pharynx was bad". The reader who masters these poems and their interrelationships has, according to Bloom, [...] "reached the center of Stevens's poetic and human anxieties and of his resources for meeting those anxieties". [...] "Hoon" [...] points the way towards Stevens's future development as a poet, in his view.|$|R

60|$|See how she rushes noiselessly, like a pale meteor, {{along the}} {{passages}} {{and up the}} gallery stairs! Those gleaming eyes, those bloodless lips, that swift silent tread, make her look like the incarnation of a fierce purpose, rather than a woman. The mid-day sun is shining on the armour in the gallery, making mimic suns on bossed sword-hilts and the angles of polished breast-plates. Yes, there are sharp weapons in the gallery. There is a dagger in that cabinet; she knows it well. And as a dragon-fly wheels in its flight to alight for an instant on a leaf, she darts to the cabinet, takes out the dagger, and thrusts it into her pocket. In three minutes more she is out, in hat and cloak, on the gravel-walk, hurrying along towards the thick shades of the distant Rookery. She threads the windings of the plantations, not feeling the <b>golden</b> leaves that <b>rain</b> upon her, not feeling the earth beneath her feet. Her hand is in her pocket, clenching {{the handle of the}} dagger, which she holds half out of its sheath.|$|R

Yet a whisper of the possibility had quickly been magnified to a certainty of such a largesse, and the multitude were thus stimulated to furious exertions to win the most favourable spot for gathering up such a <b>golden</b> <b>rain</b> as even little Prince Henry's counterpoise would afford; and ever as time waxed later, the throng grew denser and more unruly, and the struggle fiercer and more violent.|$|E

60|$|Then {{we come to}} {{the most}} abused {{pictures}} in the whole Exhibition--the 'colour symphonies' of the 'Great Dark Master,' Mr. Whistler, who deserves the name of '[Greek] as much as Heraclitus ever did. Their titles do not convey much information. No. 4 is called Nocturne in Black and Gold, No. 6A Nocturne in Blue and Silver, and so on. The first of these represents a rocket of <b>golden</b> <b>rain,</b> with green and red fires bursting in a perfectly black sky, two large black smudges on the picture standing, I believe, for a tower which is in 'Cremorne Gardens' and for a crowd of lookers-on. The other is rather prettier; a rocket is breaking in a pale blue sky over a large dark blue bridge and a blue and silver river. These pictures are certainly worth looking at for about as long as one looks at a real rocket, that is, for somewhat {{less than a quarter of}} a minute.|$|E

She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very best gunpowder. My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French extraction. He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would never come down again.

To her surprise {{they seemed to be}} returning from the ball, and she had just time to hide from them by bending her knees and holding out her arms and pretending to be a garden chair. There were six horsemen in front and six behind, in the middle walked a prim lady wearing a long train held up by two pages, and on the train, {{as if it were a}} couch, reclined a lovely girl, for in this way do aristocratic fairies travel about. She was dressed in <b>golden</b> <b>rain,</b> but the most enviable part of her was her neck, which was blue in colour and of a velvet texture, and of course showed off her diamond necklace as no white throat could have glorified it. The high-born fairies obtain this admired effect by pricking their skin, which lets the blue blood come through and dye them, and you cannot imagine anything so dazzling unless you have seen the ladies' busts in the jewellers' windows.|$|E
