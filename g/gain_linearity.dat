40|$|Abstract − A 2. 45 GHz double-balanced {{modified}} Gilbert-type CMOS up-conversion mixer {{design is}} introduced, where the PMOS current-reuse bleeding technique is demonstrated to be efficient in improving conversion <b>gain,</b> <b>linearity,</b> and noise performance. An LO buffer {{is included in}} the mixer design to perform single-ended to differential conversion of the LO signal on chip. Simulation results of the design based on careful modeling of all active and passive components are examined to explain in detail about the characteristic improvement and degradation provided by the proposed design. Two kinds of chips were fabricated using a standard 0. 35 µm CMOS process, one of which is the mixer chip without the LO buffer and the other is the one with it. The measured characteristics of the fabricated chips are quite excellent in terms of conversion <b>gain,</b> <b>linearity,</b> and noise, and they are in close match to the simulation results, which demonstrates the adequacy of the modeling approach based on the macro models for all the active and passive devices used in the design. Above all the benefits provided by the current-reuse bleeding technique, the improvement in noise performance seems most valuable...|$|E
