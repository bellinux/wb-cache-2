50|$|Force field {{analysis}} {{provides a framework}} for looking at the factors (forces) that influence a situation, originally social situations. It looks at forces that are either driving movement toward a goal (helping forces) or blocking movement toward a goal (hindering forces). Key to this approach was Lewin's interest in <b>gestaltism,</b> understanding the totality and assessing a situation {{as a whole and}} not focusing only on individual aspects. Further, the totality for an individual (their life space) derives from their perception of their reality not an objective viewpoint. The approach, developed by Kurt Lewin, is a significant contribution to the fields of social science, psychology, social psychology, organizational development, process management, and change management. His theory was expanded by John R. P. French who related it to organizational and industrial settings.|$|E

30|$|Our work {{is based}} on the idea that {{entities}} that have the same orientation form a single unit. This is inspired by <b>gestaltism</b> or Gestalt psychology [2], a theory of mind and brain positing which states in the law of common fate that elements with the same moving direction are perceived as a collective or unit. In this work, we rely mostly on motion orientation as opposed to a semidirectional model [3] because <b>gestaltism</b> does not consider motion speed. In fact, we can see in real life that moving objects that follow the same patterns do not necessarily move at the same speed. For example, in a one-way road, cars move at different speeds while sharing the same motion pattern. In addition, augmenting the direction model with the motion speed information will increase the computation burden which is not desired in real-time systems.|$|E
30|$|The perceptual view {{of visual}} {{psychology}} is mainly based on Gestalt psychological findings [77 – 79]. These {{are related to}} the laws about perceiving meaningfully and generating whole forms by the brain as a global figure rather than recognition of its simpler elements such as lines and points. Therefore, the outlook of <b>Gestaltism</b> in perception is conceptually different from the structuralist view and hence criticized by some scholars from computational neuroscience and cognitive psychology. They claim that Gestalt principles can just provide descriptive laws rather than a perceptual processing model [80]. However, the idea of Gestalt psychology attracted many scholars on relevant areas of vision research, which led to many research findings on object recognition and pattern perception in general [81].|$|E
40|$|Contours are salient {{features}} for image description, but the detection and localization of boundary contours {{is still considered}} a challenging problem. This paper introduces a new tool for edge processing implementing the <b>Gestaltism</b> idea of edge grouping. This tool is a mid-level image operator, called the Torque operator, {{that is designed to}} help detect closed contours in images. The torque operator takes as input the raw image and creates an image map by computing from the image gradients within regions of multiple sizes a measure of how well the edges are aligned to form closed convex contours. Fundamental properties of the torque are explored and illustrated through examples. Then it is applied in pure bottom-up processing in a variety of applications, including edge detection, visual attention and segmentation and experimentally demonstrated a useful tool that can improve existing techniques. Finally, its extension as a more general grouping mechanism and application in object recognition is discussed. Comment: 32 page...|$|E

Para isso, a estrutura psicológica é vista, primeiramente, a partir do gestaltismo psicológico, um estruturalismo sem gênese, e, depois, na teoria piagetiana, que introduz a gênese na estrutura. Na estrutura psicanalítica, a temporalidade é da ordem da atualização, como se pode atestar no conceito de a posteriori (o Nachträglichkeit). The article {{intends to}} {{distinguish}} the way structure is regarded by psychology from {{the way it is}} conceived in psychoanalysis, with the aim of analyzing the specificity of the idea of structure in psychoanalytical theory and its importance in relation to temporality. To this effect, psychological structure is seen firstly {{from the point of view}} of psychological <b>Gestaltism,</b> a structuralism without genesis, and secondly, in Piagetian theory, which introduces genesis into structure. In psychoanalytical structure temporality is of the order of actualization, as it can be seen in the concept of a posteriori (Nachträglichkeit) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this note, {{we propose}} a general {{definition}} of shape {{which is both}} compatible with the one proposed in phenomenology (<b>gestaltism)</b> and with a computer vision implementation. We reverse the usual order in Computer Vision. We do not define “shape recognition ” as a task which requires a “model ” pattern which is searched in all images of a certain kind. We give instead a “blind ” definition of shapes relying only on invariance and repetition arguments. Given a set of images I, wecallshape of this set any spatial pattern {{which can be found}} at several locations of some image, or in several different images of I. (This means that the shapes of a set of images are defined without any apriori assumption or knowledge.) The definition is powerful when it is invariant and we prove that the following invariance requirements can be matched in theory and in practice: local contrast invariance, robustness to blur, noise and sampling, affine deformations. We display experiments with single images and image pairs. In each case, we display the detected shapes. Surprisingly enough, but in accordance with Gestalt theory, the repetition of shapes is so frequent in human environment, that many shapes can even be learned from single images...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comparative analysis of relevant methodological essence of "traditional" and "new" cultural geography. In the introduction is given {{an explanation of}} philosophic concepts of space, environment, place and the region in cultural geography. In second section is analyzed the meaning of civilization and the genesis of geography of civilization (géographie de civilisation). Special attention is on features of geographical posibilism as methodological paradigm, {{and the concept of}} cultural landscape as the essence of classical geography of culture and civilization. After this part are researched specific characteristics of certain academic schools and methodological perspectives in cultural geography. Postmodern paradigm and essence of "new" cultural geography are in the main focus. Postmodernism is changing the meaning of the basic concepts in cultural geography, which are analyzed in the introduction, such as space, culture, cultural region, cultural landscape and others. "New" cultural geography reassessed social and moral issues associated with the characteristics of the postmodern era. In this regard, methodological paradigm must be changed. This ascertainment is based on the interpretation of humanistic geography, where the emphasis is on the interpretation of cultural symbols, causal link and the "spirit of place" (Spiritus Loci). In accordance with modern conceptions of human in psychological notion, {{there are at least three}} theoretical directions, which find resonance in the appropriate cultural geography: behaviorism, psychoanalytic concept and cognitive concept - <b>gestaltism</b> and geography of perception. In conclusion is emphasized the need of finding a dialectical unity in "classical" and "new" cultural geography. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br. 176017...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The article {{reveals the}} {{phenomenon}} of «listening» {{from the standpoint of}} the main psycholinguistic paradigms – <b>gestaltism,</b> behaviorism, generative (generating) grammar, communicativism, connectivity, cognitive psycholinguistics, neuropsycholinguistics, activity psycholinguistics. Based on the analysis of these approaches, the author concluded that the most explanatory power of the multi-faceted phenomenon of «listening» has an activity psycholinguistics. From the position of activity-based psycholinguistics and with the support of the fundamental theoretical propositions of L. S. Vyhotskyi, A. A. Zalevskaya, A. R. Luria, A. A. Leontiev, M. I. Zhynkin, A. N. Sokolov and other scientists, the author’s definition of the term «listening» is presented. In particular: listening is a receptive, internally active kind of speech activity, the process of which consists in organic unity, simultaneous mnemic perceptual-mental interaction and active integrated realization: 1) auditory perception of the values of system of language codes reflecting real reality; 2) recognition, decoding and saving them in short-term memory; and 3) understanding the meaning of the speech message, which is accomplished by implementing the mechanisms of internal speech, in which the values of «surface» linguistic forms are decoded and transformed into «deep» meanings through the comprehension and rethinking of a particular fragment of reality reflected in the utterance. The result of perceptive-cognitive-affective processing is either the exact and complete decoding and reproduction by the recipient of the author’s meaning, the construction and the formation of an individual sense, authentic to the author’s, or inaccurate and incomplete reproduction of the author's sense and the development of the oncoming-own-understanding based on a multi-faceted sensory and rational individual auditive-linguistic experience of the subject of this activity, which was formed under the influence of societ...|$|E
40|$|Many psychophysical {{studies are}} {{dedicated}} to {{the evaluation of the}} human gestalt detection on dot or Gabor patterns, and to model its dependence on the pattern and background parameters. Nevertheless, even for these constrained percepts, psychophysics have not yet reached the challenging prediction stage, where human detection would be quantitatively predicted by a (generic) model. On the other hand, Computer Vision has attempted at defining automatic detection thresholds. This chapter sketches a procedure to confront these two methodologies inspired in <b>gestaltism.</b> Using a computational quantitative version of the non-accidentalness principle, we raise the possibility that the psychophysical and the (older) gestaltist setups, both applicable on dot or Gabor patterns, find a useful complement in a Turing test. In our perceptual Turing test, human performance is compared by the scientist to the detection result given by a computer. This confrontation permits to revive the abandoned method of gestaltic games. We sketch the elaboration of such a game, where the subjects of the experiment are confronted to an alignment detection algorithm, and are invited to draw examples that will fool it. We show that in that way a more precise definition of the alignment gestalt and of its computational formulation seems to emerge. Detection algorithms might also be relevant to more classic psychophysical setups, where they can again play the role of a Turing test. To a visual experiment where subjects were invited to detect alignments in Gabor patterns, we associated a single function measuring the alignment detectability {{in the form of a}} number of false alarms (NFA). The first results indicate that the values of the NFA, as a function of all simulation parameters, are highly correlated to the human detection. This fact, that we intend to support by further experiments, might end up confirming that human alignment detection is the result of a single mechanism...|$|E
