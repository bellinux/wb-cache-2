25|$|In modern (20th century) {{theoretical}} physics, {{angular momentum}} (not including any intrinsic angular momentum – see below) is described {{using a different}} formalism, instead of a classical pseudovector. In this formalism, angular momentum is the 2-form Noether charge associated with rotational invariance. As a result, angular momentum is not conserved for general curved spacetimes, unless <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> asymptotically rotationally invariant.|$|E

25|$|Sir Isaac Newton had {{published}} his Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1687 {{in which he}} gave a derivation of Kepler's laws, which describe {{the motion of the}} planets, from his laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation. However, though Newton had privately developed the methods of calculus, all his published work used cumbersome geometric reasoning, unsuitable to account for the more subtle higher-order effects of interactions between the planets. Newton himself had doubted the possibility of a mathematical solution to the whole, even concluding that periodic divine intervention was necessary to guarantee the stability of the Solar System. Dispensing with the hypothesis of divine intervention would be a major activity of Laplace's scientific life. It is now generally regarded that Laplace's methods on their own, though vital {{to the development of the}} theory, are not sufficiently precise to demonstrate the stability of the Solar System, and indeed, the Solar System is understood to be chaotic, although <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fairly stable.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the play, Walter and Beneatha's father has recently died, and Mama is waiting for a life insurance check for $10,000. Walter has a sense of entitlement to the money, but Mama has religious objections to alcohol and Beneatha has to remind him it is Mama's call how to spend it. Eventually Mama puts some of the money down on a new house, choosing an all-white neighborhood over a black one for the practical reason that <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> much cheaper. Later she relents and gives {{the rest of the money}} to Walter to invest with the provision that he reserve $3,000 for Beneatha's education. Walter passes the money on to Willy's naive sidekick Bobo, who gives it to Willy, who absconds with it, depriving Walter and Beneatha of their dreams, though not the Youngers of their new home. Meanwhile, Karl Lindner, a white representative of the neighborhood they plan to move to, makes a generous offer to buy them out. He wishes to avoid neighborhood tensions over interracial population, which to the three women's horror Walter prepares to accept as a solution to their financial setback. Lena says that while money was something they try to work for, they should never take it if it was a person's way of telling them they weren't fit to walk the same earth as them.|$|E

[...] <b>It</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> located in the Scorpius constellation.

500|$|Exasperated {{with his}} boss's demands and annoyed by SpongeBob's eagerness, Squidward tries to scare SpongeBob into {{being afraid of}} the night shift by telling him a made-up story about the [...] "Hash-Slinging Slasher", a former fry cook at the Krusty Krab who accidentally cut off his own arm and was {{run over by a}} bus during the night shift, causing his death. Squidward {{continues}} by telling SpongeBob that every Tuesday night (the night <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>be)</b> the ghost of the Slasher returns to the Krusty Krab. Squidward says that the Slasher's arrival will be indicated by three warnings: the lights flickering on and off, the phone ringing but nobody being on the other line, and the ghost of the bus that killed the Slasher arriving to deliver him.|$|E
500|$|The film {{takes place}} {{simultaneously}} with {{the events of}} Iron Man 2 and Thor, the former of which is set {{six months after the}} events Iron Man. Downey briefly reprised his role from Iron Man as Tony Stark in a cameo appearance {{at the end of the}} film. Downey said that the filmmakers [...] "were just cross-pollinating our superheroes. <b>It</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a scene where I basically approach , and we may be considering going into some sort of limited partnership together. The great thing is he—and I don't want to give too much away—but he's in disrepair at the time I find him. It was really fun seeing him play this really powerful character who's half in the bag." [...] In addition, Captain America is briefly seen frozen in ice in an alternate opening of the film, included in the DVD release.|$|E

500|$|After Pennant's death, the French {{zoologist}} and naturalist Georges Cuvier {{wrote of}} him [...] "When {{the life of}} a man is entirely devoted to the sciences, it cannot be expected that it will present a variety of incident; it will be found most truly in the analysis of his works." [...] Pennant is cited as an authority by Thomas Bewick throughout his pioneering field guide, A History of British Birds (2 volumes, 1797 and 1804). For example, under [...] "The Golden Eagle", Bewick writes that [...] "Pennant says there are instances, though rare, of their having bred in Snowdon Hills". Bewick cites him for facts about rare species like [...] "The Sclavonian Grebe": [...] "This species is not numerous in the British Isles. Pennant says, they inhabit and breed in the fens near Spalding, in Lincolnshire, and that the female makes a nest not unlike that of the Crested Grebe, and lays four or five white eggs." [...] On occasion, Pennant's knowledge could be highly specific: for [...] "The Great-Crested Grebe", Bewick records that the nest [...] "is made of various kinds of dried fibres, stalks and leaves of water plants, and (Pennant says) of the roots of bugbane, stalks of water-lily, pond-weed and water-violet; when <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> blown from among the reeds, it floats about upon the surface of the water".|$|E

2500|$|Oz {{tends to}} present protagonists in a {{realistic}} light with an ironic touch while {{his treatment of}} the life in the kibbutz {{is accompanied by a}} somewhat critical tone. Oz credits a 1959 translation of American writer Sherwood Anderson's short story collection Winesburg, Ohio with his decision to “write about what was around me.” In A Tale of Love and Darkness, his memoir of coming of age in the midst of Israel's violent birth pangs, Oz credits Anderson's “modest book” with his own realization that [...] "the written world … always revolves around the hand that is writing, wherever <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> writing: where you are is the center of the universe." [...] In his 2004 essay [...] "How to Cure a Fanatic" [...] (later the title essay of a 2006 collection), Oz argues that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not a war of religion or cultures or traditions, but rather a real estate dispute — one that will be resolved not by greater understanding, but by painful compromise.|$|E
