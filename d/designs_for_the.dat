5|$|A {{number of}} <b>designs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> energy being were {{considered}} for this episode; however, {{the final version}} was decided upon due to a desire to keep the design simple.

5|$|A variant, {{in which}} the motif is {{enclosed}} within a relieving blind arch that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though Burlington seems to have assumed it was so, in using a drawing in his possession showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House above right). Modern scholarship attributes the drawing to Scamozzi. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of Tottenham Park in Savernake Forest for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent picked it up in his <b>designs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Houses of Parliament, and it appears in Kent's executed <b>designs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> north front of Holkham Hall.|$|E

5|$|A further {{challenge}} for the dog actor was to lie still in an isolation tank and not move even when petted by Bakula or Billingsley during some long scenes whilst on screen. At times a stunt dog was used, but Breezy was required for any close-ups. A prosthetic Beagle was also created for the scenes in the isolation tank and to be submersed in a super-hydration tank. The prop was created by Joel Harlow, who had also created make-up <b>designs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> television series Carnivàle and the film The Chronicles of Riddick.|$|E

5|$|After {{preparing}} {{its initial}} sketch design, the Navy contracted Yarrow Admiralty Research Division (Y-ARD) in July 1970 to complete preliminary <b>designs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> DDLs. As an initial stage, Y-ARD {{was required to}} develop sketch designs for six different armament configurations using a common hull. Requests for tender for studies on major sub-components were also issued in 1970, and these were completed by mid-1971.|$|E
5|$|All British {{patterns}} were different, first tested on small wooden models viewed through a periscope in a studio. Most {{of the model}} designs were painted by women from London's Royal Academy of Arts. A foreman then scaled up their <b>designs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> real thing. Painters, however, were not alone in the project. Creative people including sculptors, artists, and set designers designed camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Angela Danadjieva, a {{designer}} at Lawrence Halprin & Associates, {{was charged with}} the artistic conception. Danadjieva began her career in design with work on Constructivist set <b>designs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Bulgarian State Film agency. In the early 1960s she defected to Paris and studied at the École des Beaux Arts, and then emigrating to the United States {{towards the end of}} the decade. She took her inspiration from a book on waterfalls of the Columbia River Gorge, which was given to her by Ira Keller at the design studio. It was built by the Schrader Construction Company for $512,000.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1932, {{but due to}} a {{shortage}} of funds, the design was gradually revised and cut back, and only the Senate House and Library were completed in 1937, with the buildings for the Institute of Education and the School of Oriental Studies completed later. The design featured façades of load-bearing brickwork faced with Portland stone. Holden's intention to adorn the building with sculpture was also not fulfilled. As he had with his earlier buildings, Holden also prepared the <b>designs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> individual elements of the interior design. From its completion until 1957, it was the tallest office building in London.|$|E
5|$|Design {{work for}} {{a new class of}} battleships started about two weeks after the {{launching}} of , an , which took place on April 30, 1904. By the end of July 1905, the Austrian Commander in Chief of the Navy, Admiral Monteccuccoli, laid out his vision for an expanded Austro-Hungarian fleet. This included 12 battleships, four armored cruisers, eight scout cruisers, 18 destroyers, 36 large torpedo boats, and six submarines. A navy design board evaluated five <b>designs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> new battleship type between September 25–29, 1905.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, the Bureau of Public Roads {{began the}} process to start the {{construction}} design for the parkway. Federal and state officials commissioned the firm J.E. Greiner to create <b>designs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> parkway, which included a large Y-junction at the southern terminus to connect with New York Avenue and the proposed Anacostia Freeway. Meanwhile, the northern end included a similar wye, with one end running to US 40 (Franklin Street) and the other end crossing the Inner Harbor, but this was modified in 1945 to the current configuration.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, {{before the}} {{founding}} of BuroHappold, Edmund Happold, Ian Liddell, Vera Straka, Peter Rice and Michael Dickson established a lightweight structures research laboratory corresponding to Frei Otto's similar research institute {{at the university of}} Stuttgart. Ted Happold was the first to introduce ethylenetetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) as a cladding material, and the outcomes of the research carried out by the laboratory {{led to the development of}} the <b>designs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Mannheim Multihall gridshell and a number of landmark fabric structures in the Middle East and the UK, allowing the new building forms to become generally accepted by architects and clients.|$|E
5|$|Medieval {{construction}} was seasonal, work on site being undertaken {{only in the}} spring and summer, when the light was good and the weather more reliable. Each autumn, all exposed surfaces were covered and lagged against frost damage. The architects worked over winter in the tracing house (that of York has both a fireplace and a privy) to prepare <b>designs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next season's campaign. They translated the designs into sets of planed oak cross-sectional templates, which were given to the stone-cutters. Construction of cathedrals and major churches almost invariably started at the eastern arm, and then proceeded westwards, with towers erected last.|$|E
5|$|Nash's <b>designs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> house {{included}} a three-storey octagonal tower, with two wings coming off {{it and a}} second square tower above a porte-cochère. Inside the drawing room occupied {{the ground floor of}} the tower, with a sitting room above. The dining room was designed to hold views across the valley, and the asymmetric rooms allowed for a panorama of views. To allow easy access to the gardens, the servant's quarters were moved to a separate wing, but made to be less prominent. A chapel was added in approximately 1862, and the house's loggia was converted into a conservatory.|$|E
