50|$|Cirques form in {{conditions}} which are favorable; {{in the northern}} hemisphere the conditions include the north-east slope where they are protected from {{the majority of the}} sun’s energy and from the prevailing winds. These areas are sheltered from heat, encouraging the accumulation of snow; if the accumulation of snow increases, the snow turns into glacial ice. The process of nivation follows, whereby a hollow in a slope may be enlarged by ice segregation weathering and glacial erosion. Ice segregation erodes the rock vertical rock face and causes it to disintegrate, which may result in an avalanche bringing down more snow and rock to add to the growing glacier. Eventually, this hollow may become large enough that glacial erosion intensifies. The enlarging of this open ended concavity creates a larger leeward <b>deposition</b> <b>zone,</b> furthering the process of glaciation. Debris (or till) in the ice also may abrade (glacial abrasion) the bed surface; should ice move down a slope it would have a ‘sandpaper effect’ on the bedrock beneath, on which it scrapes.|$|E

Different methods, such as mechanical, chemical and thermal, are applied in effort to solve the paraffin deposition problem. Most methods require an accurate determination of that the <b>deposition</b> <b>zone</b> in well. In this paper, experimental and simulation results of the parameter analysis affecting intensity and zone of paraffin deposition in oil wells are presented. The analysis has been done for heavy oil produced from the oil field Turija, Vojvodina region, Serbia. The paraffin deposition curves and paraffin deposition intensity during time are experimentally defined. The influence of temperature gradient, fluid flow rate and gas content in oil changes on the paraffin <b>deposition</b> <b>zone</b> change was analyzed by the computer simulation. It was found that temperature gradient changes can cause paraffin <b>deposition</b> <b>zone</b> to change approx. 22 m, i. e. maximum 43 m. It was also determined that the length of paraffin <b>deposition</b> <b>zone</b> can change up to 140 m due to {{the changes in the}} fluid flow rate or in the gas content in oil. The increase of the flow rate causes paraffin <b>deposition</b> <b>zone</b> to reduce, while increased gas content in oil leads to its increase. On the basis of the obtained results, the optimal working parameters of mechanical method, such as frequency and depth of paraffin scraping as well as temperature and heating cable power of thermal methods can be determined...|$|E

Sampling stations were sited across potential zones of impact classified as high, moderate, and low deposition, depending on their proximity to dredging activities and their position relative to the net sediment transport route. Samples were also taken west of the dredge site outside the zone of likely impact (no deposition). A strong gradient was observed from the sediments dominated by fine sands in the high and moderate <b>deposition</b> <b>zones,</b> through to coarse sands and gravels in the low and no <b>deposition</b> <b>zones.</b> The benthic fauna sampled from the deposits of fine sand in the high and moderate <b>deposition</b> <b>zones</b> were sparse compared with the coarser deposits sampled from the low and no <b>deposition</b> <b>zones.</b> There was a strong correspondence between the distribution of different sediment fractions and the associated benthic fauna, with a weighted Spearman rank correlation of 0. 638, higher than reported in related studies.

40|$|In {{the course}} of the work {{presented}} a deposition system on laboratory scale for the fabrication of amorphous hydrogenated silicon (a-Si:H) solar cells has been designed and constructed. The system consists of seven metal sealed UHV stainless steel chambers which are linked by pressure stages. Thus the single chambers result in a long vacuum deposition system which provides the suitable <b>deposition</b> <b>zones</b> for the processes needed. In the first two zones TCO(Transparent Conductive Oxide) and metal contacts are deposited by rf magnetron sputtering whereas two of the other zones are used for the deposition of the a-Si:H layers. In the fifth zone a laser patterning system can be coupled in. The Nd:YAG laser system is necessary to fabricate integrated series connected solar modules. Intensive investigation with regard to a broad characterization of the vacuum system has been carried out. For the initiation of a prevacuum, one central dry operating pump has been installed. The regulation of the necessary pressures in the sputtering zones and the PECVD (Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor <b>Deposition)</b> <b>zones</b> has been examined successfully. The pressure stages between the <b>deposition</b> <b>zones</b> allow pressure gradients of more than 1 : 1000 between adjacent chambers. For the intended simultaneous processing a critical separation of the chambers under process conditions and without gate valves is indispensable. By means of the specific resistance of the deposited intrinsic layers the cross contamination of the doping gas phosphine as well as diborane, which flow simultaneously in neighboring <b>deposition</b> <b>zones,</b> has been proved in detail. However, the cross contamination has been minimized by appropriate measures. Thus the cross contamination practically lost its influence on the specific resistance of the i-layer. This has been reached without any further chambers or the application of purge gas.

This work delineated sediment <b>deposition</b> <b>zones</b> to streamline sediment sampling {{and to provide a}} tool for estimating sediment volumes and extrapolating contaminant concentrations throughout the system. The Clinch River arm of Watts Bar Reservoir has been accumulating sediment-bound contaminants from three Department of Energy (DOE) facilities on the Oak Ridge Reservation, Tennessee. Public concern regarding human and ecological health resulted in Watts Bar Reservoir being placed on the National Priorities List for SUPERFUND. As a result, DOE initiated and is funding the Clinch River Environmental Restoration Program (CR-ERP) to perform a remedial investigation to determine {{the nature and extent of}} sediment contamination in the Watts Bar Reservoir and the Clinch River and to quantify any human or ecological health risks. The first step in characterizing Clinch River sediments was to determine the locations of <b>deposition</b> <b>zones.</b> It was also important to know the sediment type distribution within <b>deposition</b> <b>zones</b> because most sediment-bound contaminants are preferentially associated to fine particles. A dual-frequency hydro-acoustic survey was performed to determine: (1) depth to the sediment water interface, (2) depth of the sediment layer, and (3) sediment characteristics (density) with depth (approximately 0. 5 -foot intervals).

They include two basic geomorphologic units, erosion depression and sand deposition, and three typical morphological types: saucer type, trough type, and compound type. In this study, the dynamic changes of typical blowouts within the past decade were analyzed via multiperiod high-resolution remote sensing images. RTK was used to repeatedly measure the blowouts to obtain their high-precision 3 D terrain data in 2010, 2011, and 2012. Short-term dynamic changes in 3 D blowout morphology were carefully analyzed to discover the following.

40|$|A {{large part}} of worlds {{remaining}} oil and gas resources is found in harsh environments such as deep water and arctic conditions. The development of such oil and gas fields requires advanced process and transport solutions. Wax is precipitated out of solution as reservoir fluid cools down during transport. Wax precipitation may cause operational problems when unprocessed well streams are transported in undersea pipelines. The goal of this work is to investigate modelling concept for controlled wax deposition and controlled wax loosening that is applicable to subsea flowlines in {{oil and gas production}} systems. An approach to wax control using the annulus pipe in pipe flow concept is modelled and also described. Wax thermodynamic and deposition models is reviewed and evaluated. The review is aimed to provide accurate prediction analysis of wax precipitation and to serve as a reliable knowledge input into wax deposition modelling in oil and gas flow systems. The cold flow concept for wax deposition solution is developed using an annulus pipe in pipe configuration for the cooling of oil below the wax appearance temperature. A wax <b>deposition</b> <b>zone</b> is created, an effect of a large temperature gradient, which is the driving force between cooling water and the flowing oil in the annulus cooling section of the pipeline. Co-current and counter current oil cooling cases is tested. The counter current annulus-cooling case is validated to adequately knock out potential wax from the oil in the wax <b>deposition</b> <b>zone.</b> The annulus cooling approach is considered to provide an efficient and economic wax control strategy for the mechanical removal of wax in a wax control zone when pigging of wax is to be employed in a flowline eliminating excessively long pigging routes and high cost of pigging operation in typical subsea pipelines. A wax-loosening model is further developed to determine potential loosening and potential transport tendencies of stable wax solids liberated from the wall flowline downstream the annulus. Experimental results from the Porsgrunn flow loop of Statoil AS reveals that stable wax solid is released from wax deposits on pipeline walls when the inner wall is heated {{for a short period of}} time such that released stable wax is transported in the cool stream with no or low tendency of re-deposition downstream the flowline. Deposited wax in the wax <b>deposition</b> <b>zone</b> is liberated using hot water sent through the annulus. Model results show re-deposition downstream the flowline. Ability of this wax deposition module to predict wax loosening is criticised. OLGA shows good representation of wax deposition growth in the annulus but incapable to represent expected wax liberation in the flowline at temperatures higher than the wax appearance temperature but below the dissolution temperature. A cold flow wax liberation model using active fluid forces with minimum wall heating for effective stripping of wax from the wax <b>deposition</b> <b>zone</b> is proposed. </p...|$|E

This study provides detailed results on on-site sediment deposition and net soil loss in terraced croplands in a catchment in the sub-humid Ethiopian Highlands. Sediment deposition was measured on horse bean and maize fields during the crop growing seasons of 2014 and 2015. Measurements took place on observation plots on terraced cropland with varying spacing between terraces and varying slope gradients. Net soil loss, in this case the amount leaving the terraced cropland, was calculated by modelling the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) for the whole observation field and subtracting the measured sediment deposition. The study result showed about 8 – 11  t ha− 1 sediment was deposited in the <b>deposition</b> <b>zone</b> of the terraced cropland, with greater sediment deposition on terraces with narrow spacing and steeper slope gradients. Sediment deposition was highest in July and August, and relatively low in September. Annual soil loss ranged from 32 to 37  t ha− 1 in the terraced cropland of the study area. From the total soil loss in the crop growing season, about 54 – 74 % sediment was deposited on the <b>deposition</b> <b>zone</b> of terraced crop fields.

The main source material was the landslide deposits retained in the ravine during the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. This paper describes a two-dimensional hybrid numerical method that simulates the entire process of the debris flow from initiation to transportation and finally to deposition. The study area is discretized into a grid of square zones. A two dimensional finite difference method is then applied to simulate the rainfall-runoff and debris flow runout processes. The analysis {{is divided into three}} steps; namely, rainfall-runoff simulation, mixing water and solid materials, and debris flow runout simulation. The rainfall-runoff simulation is firstly conducted to obtain the cumulative runoff near the location of main source material and at the outlet of the first branch. The water and solid materials are then mixed to create an inflow hydrograph for the debris flow runout simulation. The occurrence time and volume of the debris flow can be estimated in this step. Finally the runout process of the debris flow is simulated.

It strongly indicates that a considerable amount of 137 Cs input was lost prior to incorporation into the ploughing layer from the study field during the nuclear weapons testing period because of 137 Cs surface enrichment. The average erosion rate is estimated to be 4914 t/km 2 yr for a typical cultivated steep slope with an angle of 34 °at the subtropical zone in the Mt Gongga region. It can reach to 22856 t/km 2 yr for a failure slope under cultivation...|$|R
