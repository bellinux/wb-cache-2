25|$|While reincarnation {{has been}} a matter of faith in some {{communities}} from an early date it has also frequently been argued for on principle, as Plato <b>does</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> argues that the number of souls must be finite because souls are indestructible, Benjamin Franklin held a similar view. Sometimes such convictions, as in Socrates' case, arise from a more general personal faith, at other times from anecdotal evidence such as Plato makes Socrates offer in the Myth of Er.|$|E

500|$|Bill Veeck said of Stengel in 1966, {{soon after}} the manager's retirement, [...] "He was never {{necessarily}} the greatest of managers, but any time he had a ball club that {{had a chance to}} win, he'd win." [...] Stengel's American League rival, Al Lopez, once said of him [...] "I swear I don't understand {{some of the things he}} <b>does</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> manages". Though platooning survives, Stengel's intuitive approach to managing is no longer current in baseball, replaced by the use of statistics, and the advent of instant replay makes obsolete Stengel's tendency to charge from the dugout to confront an umpire over a disputed call.|$|E
500|$|Though {{a skilled}} swordsman, Sparrow prefers {{to use his}} {{superior}} intelligence during combat, exploiting his environment to turn the tables on his foes, reasoning [...] "Why fight when you can negotiate?" [...] He uses strategies of non-violent negotiation and turning his enemies against each other. He invokes parleys and tempts his enemies away from their murderous intentions, encouraging them to see the bigger picture, as he <b>does</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> persuades Barbossa to delay returning to mortal form so he can battle the Royal Navy. He often uses complex wordplay and vocabulary to confound his enemies, and {{it is suggested that}} his pacifism may be one reason Barbossa and the crew of the Black Pearl mutinied.|$|E
500|$|The {{nature of}} human evil forms a {{significant}} related theme through A Wizard of Earthsea {{as well as the}} other Earthsea novels. As with other works by Le Guin, evil is shown as a misunderstanding of the balance of life. Ged is born with great power in him, but the pride that he takes in his power leads to his downfall; he tries to demonstrate his strength by bringing a spirit back from the dead, and in performing this act against the laws of nature, releases the shadow that attacks him. Slusser suggests that although he is provoked into performing dangerous spells first by the girl on Gont and then by Jasper, this provocation exists in Ged's mind. He is shown as unwilling to look within himself and see the pride that drives him to do what he <b>does.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> accepts the shadow into himself, he also finally accepts responsibility for his own actions, and by accepting his own mortality he is able to free himself. His companion Vetch describes the moment by saying ...|$|E

500|$|Adams' art {{style is}} {{noted for its}} high level of detail, {{and he has a}} {{reputation}} of being a [...] "tight" [...] penciller. He states that he works at a slow pace, which limits the amount of work he <b>does.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> penciled Fantastic Four #347–349 in 1990 for regular writer/illustrator Walter Simonson, who needed a break in order to catch up on his own work on that title, Adams managed to pencil the first two issues in five weeks and four weeks, respectively, but was considerably late on the third. In 1997 Adams stated that he could produce a page of either pencils or inks in a day. In a 2007 interview, he stated he tends to produce ⅔ to ¾ of a page a day, and can also ink at that rate, but can do up to two pages in a day if he is under pressure, as when he produced Cloak and Dagger #9 (1986) in 22 days, for example. Another example is the 1989 one-shot , which due to changing deadlines, he completed at a quicker pace. Adams singles out one page of that book that he drew a half-hour as his personal record for speed, but decries its poor quality. Adams is also noted for the humor in his work, as with, for example, the extraneous characters he places in cameo appearances in the backgrounds of his comics, as when he drew Gumby in the panels of Longshot, or the forms in which he depicted the shapeshifting alien Warlock in his The New Mutants work.|$|E

2500|$|These monuments, statues, and masonry {{reference}} both Horace's Odes and Ovid's Metamorphoses. Lars Engle {{argues that}} echoing the ancients, as the speaker <b>does</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> says [...] "not marble, nor the gilded monuments / Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;" [...] further solidifies the speaker's claim about {{the longevity of}} the written word. [...] However, while Horace and Ovid claim the immortality for themselves, the speaker in sonnet 55 bestows it on another. [...] Engle also claims {{that this is not}} the first time Shakespeare references the self-aggrandizement of royals and rulers by saying that poetry will outlive them. [...] He frequently mentions his own (political) unimportance, which could lead sonnet 55 to be read as a sort of revenge of the socially humble on their oppressors.|$|E
2500|$|The game on {{the right}} {{is the same as the}} above game except that player 2 does not know what player 1 <b>does</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> comes to play. The first game {{described}} has perfect information; the {{game on the}} right does not. If both players are rational and both know that both players are rational and everything that is known by any player is known to be known by every player (i.e. player 1 knows player 2 knows that player 1 is rational and player 2 knows this, etc. ad infinitum), play in the first game will be as follows: player 1 knows that if he plays U, player 2 will play D' [...] (because for player 2 a payoff of 1 is preferable to a payoff of 0) and so player 1 will receive 2. However, if player 1 plays D, player 2 will play U' [...] (because to player 2 a payoff of 2 is better than a payoff of 1) and player 1 will receive 1.
