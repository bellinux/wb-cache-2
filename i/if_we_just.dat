5|$|Eliot {{began writing}} The Dry Salvages {{at the end}} of 1940 during air-raids on London, and managed to finish the poem quickly. The poem {{included}} many personal images connecting to Eliot's childhood, and emphasised the image of water and sailing as a metaphor for humanity. According to the poem, there is a connection to all of mankind within each man. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{it will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past in order to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation.|$|E
5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} internal aspects. Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution that separate mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man there is a connection to all of mankind. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are able to overcome time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and that we are able to join the eternal.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> {{look at the}} {{short-term}} spectrum of modulation, changing as it would for a human voice for instance, then we can plot the frequency content (horizontal axis) {{as a function of}} time (vertical axis) as in Fig. 3. It can again be seen that as the modulation frequency content varies, at any point in time there is an upper sideband generated according to those frequencies shifted above the carrier frequency, and the same content mirror-imaged in the lower sideband below the carrier frequency. At all times, the carrier itself remains constant, and of greater power than the total sideband power.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Private Plane", after {{receiving}} word that Blackadder and Baldrick {{may have been}} killed when shot down over German lines, Melchett tries to cheer George up by showing him a life-size model (measuring seventeen square feet) of land recaptured by the British, a commentary on the high human cost and small physical gains achieved by attacks in the middle years of the war. Later in the same episode, Blackadder describes the Great War as: [...] "a war {{which would be a}} damn sight simpler <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> stayed in England and shot fifty thousand of our men a week." ...|$|E
500|$|Kahn {{also said}} that instead of taking the song's lyrics and being [...] "pretentious" [...] about it, {{he wanted to show}} the {{audience}} exactly what Brown was singing about, commenting, [...] "What <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> got ambitious and demonstrated the lyrics? The trick is {{to do it in a}} creative way. Let's try to display the lyrics and the feeling of the dance at the same time." [...] On October 2009, Brown released screencaps for the video, coincidentally the same day Rihanna released her video for [...] "Russian Roulette". The photos showed several scenes, including Brown in the middle of a squadron of black storm troopers, Brown in a gray suit, and him giving a karate kick in mid-air. Another was also of Brown, Wayne and Swizz Beatz standing confidently against a white backdrop.|$|E
500|$|Filmed in real time, {{the episode}} is {{designed}} to look like it was recorded in four uninterrupted eleven-minute takes. Carter explained, [...] "I said [...] 'Wouldn't it be great since we have 44 minutes of programming time <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> did an episode where we did four 11-minute takes and put it all together?' And everyone {{looked at me like}} I was nuts." [...] To film the episode, camera operator Dave Luckenbach wore a steadicam. However, the steadicam used could only hold a maximum of four minutes of film, so discreet edits and cuts were necessary. Luckenbach later likened the physical aftermath of filming to playing football, [...] "You'd have a game on Friday, and you'd wake up Saturday and really feel it." [...] The cuts were usually made during whip pans or in scenes when the screen would go dark. With the exception of Mulder jumping off the Queen Anne, the only noticeable editing occurs between scenes, when a side swipe shifts between the two different time periods. Many of the takes needed to be nearly perfect; for example, of the takes made on the eighth day of filming, only two of ten were deemed satisfactory.|$|E

2500|$|When Cixi {{received}} an ultimatum demanding that China surrender total control over all its military and financial affairs to foreigners, she defiantly stated before the Grand Council, [...] "Now they [...] have started the aggression, and {{the extinction of}} our nation is imminent. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> fold our arms and yield to them, I would have no face to see our ancestors after death. If we must perish, why not fight to the death?" [...] It {{was at this point}} that Cixi began to blockade the legations with the armies of the Beijing Field Force, which began the siege.|$|E
2500|$|Chief Executive CY Leung {{said that}} protesters need to {{carefully}} consider {{what sort of}} democracy they are pursuing. He welcomed {{the end of the}} occupation, saying: [...] "Other than economic losses, I believe the greatest loss Hong Kong society has suffered is the damage {{to the rule of law}} by a small group of people... <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> talk about democracy without talking about the rule of law, it's not real democracy but a state of no government". Leung saw his popularity ratings slump to a new low following the occupation protests, down to 39.7 percent, with a net of minus 37%. This was attributed to public perception of Leung's unwillingness to heal the wounds, and his unwarranted shifting of the blame for the wrongs in society onto opponents. Leung also claimed negative effects on the economy without providing evidence, and his assertions were contradicted by official figures. On, 19 December 2014, the eve of the 15th anniversary of Macau's handover, authorities in Macau banned journalists covering the arrival of Chinese president Xi Jinping from holding umbrellas in the rain.|$|E

60|$|He {{tried to}} bring her a little more up into the wind, but she nearly lay over onto her beam-ends, and Jabez let her go ahead again. We saw one more flash, and then a broad faint light. The ship was burning a blue light. She was not a mile ahead now, and we {{could see she was}} a large vessel. I had often been to the Scillys before, and knew them as well as I did our coast, but I could not see the land. It was as Jabez had said--a toss-up. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> missed one of them we might manage to bring up under its lee; but if we ran dead into one or other of them the Jane would break up like an egg-shell.|$|E
