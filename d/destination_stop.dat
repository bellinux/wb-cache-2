To cross the Detroit River, these railroads operated ferries between docks on either side. The ferries lacked the capacity to handle the shipping needs of the railroads, and frequently there were 700-1,000 freight cars waiting to cross the river, with numerous passengers delayed in transit. Warehouses in Chicago were forced to store grain that could not be shipped to eastern markets and foreign goods were stored in eastern warehouses waiting shipment to the western United States. The net effect of these delays increased commodity prices in the country, and both merchants and farmers wanted a solution from the railroads.|$|E

30|$|Step 1 : Two {{assumptions}} {{proposed by}} Barry et al. [38] are used: (1) a passenger will {{start a new}} trip near the destination of the current trip. Therefore, the bus stop which is closest to (and within 2 km of) the boarding stop or station of the next trip is inferred as the <b>destination</b> <b>stop</b> of the current bus trip. Here, 2 km is selected as the maximum radius to search candidate stops, because previous works [38 – 41] suggest that the maximum radius of individual walking activities is 1 – 2 km.

40|$|Service {{reliability}} {{effects on}} passengers Service reliability {{is an important}} quality characteristic in public transport. However, in cost-benefit analyses, this quality aspect is rarely taken into account explicitly, since the interaction between vehicle variability and passenger reliability is complex. In our research [Van Oort 2011], we presented the main impacts on vehicle variability on passengers, being additional waiting time, a distribution of passenger travel time (and thus insecure arrival times) and crowding. In this paper we describe how to calculate these effects quantitavely and how to take them into account in a cost benefit analysis. Figure 1 illustrates the differences and relations between the demand and supply sides. Passenger waiting time is determined by actual headways and departure times next to passenger arrival time at the stop. In addition, passenger in-vehicle time {{is equal to the}} trip time of the vehicle and together with the departure time, the arrival time at the <b>destination</b> <b>stop</b> is set. In this paper, we provide equations to translate vehicle characteristics into passenger effects. This relationship depends on the arrival pattern of passengers at their arrival stop. In a survey we found out that passenger tend to arrive at random if headways are 10 minutes or less. In that case the additional waiting time of passengers is determined by the headway variation...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{contributes to}} a very active body of literature on the application of Automated Data Collection Systems (ADCS) and openly shared data to public transportation planning. It also addresses the interaction between transit demand and land use patterns, {{a key component of}} generating time-varying origin-destination (O-D) matrices at a route level. An origin-destination (O-D) matrix describes the travel demand between two different locations and is indispensable information for most transportation applications, from strategic planning to traffic control and management. A transit passenger's O-D pair at the route level simply indicates the origin and <b>destination</b> <b>stop</b> along the considered route. Observing existing land use types (e. g., residential, commercial, institutional) within the catchment area of each stop can help in identifying existing transit demand at any given time or over time. The proposed research addresses incorporation of an alighting probability matrix (APM) - tabulating the probabilities that a passenger alights at stops downstream of the boarding at a specified stop - into a time-varying O-D estimation process, based on the passenger's trip purpose or activity locations represented by the interactions between transit demand and land use patterns. In order to examine these interactions, this research also uses a much larger dataset that has been automatically collected from various electronic technologies: Automated Fare Collection (AFC) systems and Automated Passenger Counter (APC) systems, in conjunction with other readily available data such as Google's General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) and parcel-level land use data. The large and highly detailed datasets have the capability of rectifying limitations of manual data collection (e. g., on-board survey) as well as enhancing any existing decision-making tools. This research proposes use of Google's GTFS for a bus stop aggregation model (SAM) based on distance between individual stops, textual similarity, and common service areas. By measuring land use types within a specified service area based on SAM, this research helps in advancing our understanding of transit demand in the vicinity of bus stops. In addition, a systematic matching technique for aggregating stops (SAM) allows us to analyze the symmetry of boarding and alightings, which can observe a considerable passenger flow between specific time periods and symmetry by time period pairs (e. g., between AM and PM peaks) on an individual day. This research explores the potential generation of a time-varying O-D matrix from APC data, in conjunction with integrated land use and transportation models. This research aims at incorporating all valuable information - the time-varying alighting probability matrix (TAPM) that represents on-board passengers' trip purpose - into the O-D estimation process. A practical application is based on APC data on a specific transit route in the Minneapolis - St. Paul metropolitan area. This research can also provide other practical implications. It can help transit agencies and policy makers to develop decision-making tools to support transit planning, using improved databases with transit-related ADCS and parcel-level land use data. As a result, this work not only has direct implications for the design and operation of future urban public transport systems (e. g., more precise bus scheduling, improve service to public transport users), but also for urban planning (e. g., for transit oriented urban development) and travel forecasting...|$|E
40|$|The {{last few}} decades have shown a {{substantial}} increase in personal mobility. Urban traffic and transport volumes have been increasing for years. However, the share of public transport in this mobility growth did not change much and still remains rather limited. To ensure the accessibility and liveability of our cities for future generations, however, a substantial quality leap in public transport is necessary. This will facilitate a desired modal shift from car traffic towards public transport, which is safer, cleaner and produces less congestion. In this thesis, we demonstrate that several promising opportunities exist to improve service reliability (i. e. the certainty of service aspects compared to the schedule as perceived by the user), being {{one of the most important}} quality aspects of public transport. Literature shows that in urban public transport substantial attention is given to ways to improve service reliability at the operational level. It is not clear how and to what extent strategic and tactical design decisions in public transport systems might affect service reliability. Only traffic light priority and exclusive lanes are considered during the planning of urban public transport in order to improve the level of service reliability. We expect that more instruments at these planning levels enable high-quality services at the operational level, especially with regard to service reliability. In this thesis, we present several planning instruments that facilitate enhanced service reliability. In addition, we show forecasting tools we developed and we introduce a new indicator that expresses the impacts of service reliability more effectively than traditional indicators, namely the additional travel time per passenger. This way, the assessment of public transport benefits will be substantially improved, thereby enabling cost-effective quality improvements. We show the impacts of unreliable services on passengers, being average travel time extension, increased travel time variability and a lower probability of finding a seat in the vehicle. We demonstrate how actual vehicle trip time variability (i. e. service variability) affects service reliability and passenger travel time. In order to gain insights into the mechanisms between these two aspects, we performed research based on empirical data of the public transport system in The Hague. Furthermore, we conducted an international survey of service reliability. Several traditional quantifications of service reliability are presented, such as punctuality and regularity. We demonstrate the shortcomings of these traditional indicators, namely a lack of attention for passenger impacts. Traditional indicators focus too much on the supply side of public transport, which does not allow a proper analysis of passenger effects. To deal with the shortcomings of traditional indicators, we developed a new indicator, being the average additional travel time per passenger. This indicator translates the supply-side indicators, for instance punctuality, into the additional travel time that a passenger on average needs to travel from the origin to the <b>destination</b> <b>stop</b> due to service variability. The average additional travel time may be calculated per stop or per line and enables explicit consideration of service reliability in cost-benefit calculations, since the level of service reliability may be translated into regular travel time. In our research we demonstrate that our indicator enables optimization of network and timetable planning and that the use of traditional indicators may lead to conflicting conclusions in terms of service reliability. We also demonstrate the benefits of using reliability buffer time (RBT, as described by Furth and Muller 2006) as an indication of the effects of uncertain arrivals for passengers (i. e. the variability of the average additional travel time per passenger). To improve service reliability through enhanced network and timetable design, we selected five planning instruments by analysing the causes of service variability. The main external causes are the weather, other traffic, irregular loads and passengers’ behaviour. Other public transport, driver behaviour, schedule quality and network and vehicle design are the main internal causes of unreliability. Since the arrival pattern of passengers is very important when calculating service reliability effects, we performed a passenger survey in The Hague. It showed that passengers tend to arrive at random at their departure stop if scheduled headways are 10 minutes or less. In the case of longer headways, passengers on average plan their arrival about 2 minutes prior to the scheduled vehicle departure time. Applying instruments during the planning stages will reduce the impacts of these causes. At the strategic level, these instruments are: - Terminal design; The configuration and number of tracks and switches at the terminal determines the expected vehicle delay and thus service reliability. - Line length; The length of a line is often related to the level of service variability and thus service reliability. - Line coordination. Multiple lines on a shared track may offer a higher level of service reliability than one line (assuming equal frequencies). The following instruments may be applied at the tactical level: - Trip time determination; In long-headway services, scheduled vehicle departure times at the stop, derived from scheduled trip times, determine the arrival pattern of passengers at their departure stop. Adjusting the scheduled trip time may affect the level of service reliability and passenger waiting time. - Vehicle holding. Holding early vehicles reduces driving ahead of schedule and increases the level of service reliability. The design of the schedule affects the effectiveness of this instrument. The terminal design instrument relates to (new) rail lines with tail tracks as terminal or short-turning facilities. For high-frequency, distributed lines, we recommend compact tail tracks with double crossovers directly after the stop. Concerning (new) lines with a clear break point in passenger pattern, we recommend to split the line or to apply holding points. For long-headway services we propose to use the 35 -percentile value for scheduled trip time. And if parts of lines are very crowded, we suggest investigating the effects of coordination. A tentative cost-effectiveness assessment showed that the tactical instruments (trip determination and vehicle holding) are cost-effective in almost every case. Their benefits are substantial and the costs are nil. These instruments should be considered in the design of every public transport system. However, the vehicle holding instrument is only beneficial if the passenger pattern has a clear break point and trip time determination only is relevant in long-headway services. It is presented that strategic instruments have considerable benefits as well. Optimized terminal design enables enhanced service reliability. Coordination and shorter lines may result in reduced passenger travel times as well. However, these instruments may look costly due to necessary additional infrastructure and or (occasionally) additional vehicles. We demonstrated that the costs are limited in relation to the potential welfare benefits. We roughly estimated the costs of unreliability at  12 million per year in The Hague and we estimated the potential savings at  8 million per year by applying the five planning instruments we analysed in our research. The estimated costs of these instruments are assessed to be only a part of the benefits with a maximum of  3 million per year, showing the added value of the instruments. The results of our international survey show that similar results are achievable in other cities as well. In this thesis we presented planning instruments that facilitate enhanced service reliability. To achieve a higher level of service reliability in practice, we recommend considering service reliability explicitly in the design of infrastructure networks, service networks and timetables using our developed control framework and tools. Service reliability effects should be incorporated in a sophisticated way into cost-benefit analyses of public transport projects, using the average additional travel time per passenger we introduced. This way, welfare gains and additional revenues may be calculated. Optimized strategic and tactical design improves service reliability and also simplifies the operational process with regard to service reliability. Enhanced service planning will allow passengers to benefit from improved service reliability tomorrow...|$|E
