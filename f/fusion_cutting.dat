40|$|From {{industrial}} electrical machine production {{it is well}} known, that {{processing of}} non-oriented electrical steels causes changes in the lattice and microstructure that also affect the magnetic structure. While applying these manufacturing techniques (punching or laser <b>fusion</b> <b>cutting),</b> mechanical and thermal stresses are induced due to elastic and plastic deformation or temperature gradients within the material. For more than 15 years, <b>fusion</b> <b>cutting</b> with CO 2 -lasers enabled a flexible and wear-free production but mostly for prototypes and small batches. Ten years ago, the development of fraction limited solid-state lasers started and thus enabled laser remote cutting.

40|$|International audienceThe {{understanding}} of melt flow dynamics during <b>fusion</b> laser <b>cutting</b> {{is still a}} topic of great importance because this determines the quality characteristics of the processed workpiece. Despite {{the complexity of the}} experimental study of the physical processes involved in this technique, <b>fusion</b> laser <b>cutting</b> can be visualized during the processing of glass because this material absorbs the laser radiation provided by a CO 2 laser but shows transparency to the visible radiation. Then, we present in this work {{the results of the study}} of the melt flow dynamics during laser cutting of glass. For different experimental conditions, the dynamics of the cutting front and its complete geometry (front wall inclination), and the evolution of the melt along the cut edge have been analysed by using a high speed video camera to study the process. It was found a phenomena no previously reported in the literature concerning to the ability of the plasma plume formed during the process. This can displace the normal shock wave (MSD) commonly formed in the inlet kerf being and can affect to the assist gas flow into the kerf. On the other hand, the analysis of the recorded images allows determining the amount of molten material along the cut edge but also the direction and the velocity of the melt. Relevant processing parameters affecting to the flow of molten material were assessed. These results are used as a basis to explain the different processes involved in the generation of dross, a typical imperfection appeared in laser cutting...|$|R
40|$|This work {{provides}} modeling {{efforts and}} supplemental experimental work performed towards {{the ultimate goal}} of modeling heat transfer, mass transfer, and deformation occurring in biological tissue, in particular during arterial <b>fusion</b> and <b>cutting.</b> Developing accurate models of these processes accomplishes two goals. First, accurate models would enable engineers to design devices to be safer and less expensive. Second, the mechanisms behind tissue <b>fusion</b> and <b>cutting</b> are widely unknown; models with the ability to accurately predict physical phenomena occurring in the tissue will allow for insight into the underlying mechanisms of the processes. This work presents three aims and the efforts in achieving them, leading to an accurate model of tissue fusion and more broadly the thermo-poromechanics (TPM) occurring within biological tissue. Chapters 1 and 2 provide the motivation for developing accurate TPM models of biological tissue and an overview of previous modeling efforts. In Chapter 3, a coupled thermo-structural finite element (FE) model with the ability to predict arterial cutting is offered. From the work presented in Chapter 3, it became obvious a more detailed model was needed. Chapter 4 meets this need by presenting small strain TPM theory and its implementation in an FE code. The model is then used to simulate thermal tissue fusion. These simulations show the model’s promise in predicting the water content and temperature of arterial wall tissue during the fusion process, but it is limited by its small deformation assumptions. Chapters 5 - 7 attempt to address this limitation by developing and implementing a large deformation TPM FE model. Chapters 5, 6, and 7 present a thermodynamically consistent, large deformation TPM FE model and its ability to simulate tissue fusion. Ultimately, this work provides several methods of simulating arterial tissue fusion and the thermo-poromechanics of biological tissue. It is the first work, to the author’s knowledge, to simulate the fully coupled TPM of biological tissue and the first to present a fully coupled large deformation TPM FE model. In doing so, a stepping stone for more advanced modeling of biological tissue has been laid...|$|R

The quality parameters utilised for Acceptable / Not Acceptable process conditions classification were the vibration level during machining {{and the type of}} chip generated ranked between 1 (good) and 5 (bad) on the basis of expert turning operator knowledge.

The obtained results showed that the NN SR (Success Rate) for Acceptable process conditions identification are always significantly higher than for Not Acceptable process conditions. By resorting to sensor fusion of the 3 cutting force components (Fx + Fy + Fz) instead of using single cutting force components (Fx, Fy, Fz), the NN SR tend to increase also for Not Acceptable process conditions identification.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{fundamental}} interaction mechanisms of laser remote <b>fusion</b> <b>cutting,</b> RFC, {{which is based}} on the formation of a quasi-stationary laser-induced boiling front that causes drop ejection, preferably downwards. Laser cutting of metals, invented in 1967, has developed from a niche to a well established high quality cutting technique in the manufacturing industry. Usually a gas jet is employed concentric to the laser beam, to eject the molten metal. One technique option, interesting though hardly applied yet because of usually low quality and speed, is remote laser cutting. Two techniques are distinguished, remote ablation cutting, grooving down through a sheet, layer-by-layer, and the here addressed remote <b>fusion</b> <b>cutting,</b> by a single pass through the sheet. For the latter, the ablation pressure from laser-induced boiling at the cutting front continuously accelerates and ejects the melt downwards. Advantages of remote laser cutting, facilitated by high brilliance lasers during the last decade, are the possibility of a larger working distance along with the avoidance of cutting gas and of a gas jet nozzle.   The review paper of the thesis surveys different laser remote cutting techniques, including their modelling, as well as the transition to keyhole welding, owing to similarities particularly from the boiling front and from root spatter ejection. The six Papers I-VI that compose the thesis address fundamental mechanisms of laser remote <b>fusion</b> <b>cutting,</b> theoretically and experimentally. In Paper I a simplified mathematical model of the RFC cutting front enables to estimate the geometrical and energetic conditions of the process. By evidence and post-modelling from high speed imaging, HSI, the simplified smooth cutting front model is developed further to a wavy topology in Paper III, for more sophisticated absorption analysis. As a systematic support, Paper II categorizes and analyses {{for the first time the}} different wavy topologies observed at the front, from HSI. The melt dynamics induced by a pulsed laser beam was studied in Paper IV, again from HSI. Apart from other interesting transient melt phenomena it was demonstrated that the ablation pressure can push the melt to a certain pending position during the laser pulse while the melt retreats by surface tension during the pulse break. To engage remote <b>fusion</b> <b>cutting</b> with additive manufacturing, Paper V introduces a novel technique where the drops ejected from RFC are transferred to a substrate, about a centimetre underneath, on which a continuous track forms. This technique can even be applied as an efficient recycling approach. In Paper VI a variant of the technique is presented, to develop a boiling front along the edge of a metal sheet from which the drop transfer takes place, in a different manner. This enables to systematically machine-off the entire sheet, which can be converted to a new shape and product.   Summarizing, the thesis provides a variety of analysis of fundamental mechanisms of a laser-induced boiling front that bear a certain simplicity and in turn controllability, of interest for established as well as for new applications, in manufacturing and in other sectors, including remote <b>fusion</b> <b>cutting...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{nature of}} the front surface in laser welding and laser remote <b>fusion</b> <b>cutting</b> is of importance. Both {{processes}} have in common that their front is governed by the ablation pressure from laser-induced surface boiling. The geometry of the front is calculated by a simplified analytical model, through local calculation of an energy balance between the absorbed laser beam and heat losses, neglected multiple beam scattering. From high speed imaging of the front a pattern can be seen, moving downwards. The pattern is interpreted as mass movement of topology along with temperature variations. In combination with modelling of the front shape, applying simplifying assumptions the greyscale variation of the images were converted to a three-dimensional wavy surface of the front in remote <b>fusion</b> <b>cutting.</b> This modelled geometry including the topology enabled sophisticated analysis regarding {{the distribution of the}} angles of beam incidence, absorptivity and absorption in combination with beam projection. The analysis enabled to study sub-trends like roughness sensitivity, shadow regimes, time dependence and separation or combination of peaks and valleys. Statistical analysis by frequency polygons enabled to clearly identify certain trends, despite the very complex front topology and movement. When correlating the angle dependent Fresnel-absorptivity characteristics with the steep main inclination angle of the processing front, conclusions on the sensitivity of the front with respect to a wavy topology can be made. For remote cutting of stainless steel with a fibre laser, in one studied case about 25 % of the surface were shadow domains, 15 % of the surface had so glancing angles of incidence that the absorptivity became strongly modulated between 0 - 35 %, while most of the surface, namely 60 % remained in a narrow absorptivity window of 35 - 43 %. This very robust behaviour is likely to take place for most parameter combinations, demonstrating a very typical and predictable absorption behaviour of lasers with about 1 μm wavelength.
