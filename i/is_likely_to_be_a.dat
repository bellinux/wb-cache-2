5|$|Since 47 Ursae Majoris c was {{detected}} indirectly, properties {{such as its}} radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. Based on its high mass, the planet <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> gas giant with no solid surface.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the planet}} was {{detected}} indirectly through observations of its star, properties {{such as its}} radius, composition, and temperature are unknown.

25|$|Compared with GABAA, GABAC receptors have {{a higher}} {{affinity}} for GABA, they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> longer-lasting in activity, and their responses <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> generated by lower GABA concentrations.|$|R

50|$|Today it {{is pointed}} out the accusations <b>to</b> Ikami and Osada <b>were</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> plotted for depriving her son of the throne, and they <b>were</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> assassinated, by Fujiwara no Momokawa.|$|R
5|$|Based on {{its high}} mass, Gliese 876 c <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> gas giant with no solid surface. Since it was {{detected}} indirectly through its gravitational {{effects on the}} star, properties such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. Assuming a composition similar to Jupiter and an environment close to chemical equilibrium, the planet is predicted to have a cloudless upper atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The Ioviani and Herculiani legions and equites Dalmatae are not {{mentioned}} by the sources as under Julian, but {{as part of}} the Gaul comitatus of usurper Magnentius. They are likely to have been inherited by Julian. If all these units were present at Strasbourg, the infantry total is 1,500 short, or 3,500 if Severus commanded an extra 2,000 men. Probably the names of a number of auxilia regiments (and possibly a legion) are missing in our sources. If so, {{at least one of these}} units <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sagittarii (archer) unit, as a comitatus would be incomplete without archer capacity. Overall, the most likely scenario is that Julian's force at Strasbourg consisted of 5-6 legiones and 10-14 auxilia of infantry and 6 vexillationes of cavalry.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way is a barred {{spiral galaxy}} with a {{diameter}} between 100,000 and 180,000 light-years. The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars. There are probably at least 100 billion planets in the Milky Way. The Solar System is located within the disk, about 26,000 light-years from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge {{of one of the}} spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust called the Orion Arm. The stars in the inner ≈10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge. The very center is marked by an intense radio source, named Sagittarius A*, which <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> supermassive black hole.|$|E
50|$|Mass-{{produced}} cider, such as {{that produced}} by Bulmers, <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pasteurised and force-carbonated.

5|$|The {{final version}} of Youth and Pleasure was painted between 1830 and 1832, but Etty had been contemplating a {{painting}} on the theme since 1818–19. In 1822 he had exhibited an early version at the British Institution titled A Sketch from One of Gray's Odes (Youth on the Prow); in this version the group of figures on the prow is reversed, and the swimmers around the boat are absent. Another rough version of the painting also survives, similar to the 1832 version but again with the figures on the prow reversed. This version was exhibited at a retrospective of Etty's work at the Society of Arts in 1849; it is dated 1848 but this <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> misprint of 1828, making it a preliminary study for the 1832 painting.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of occupation from the Neolithic period in Cheddar. Britain's oldest complete human skeleton, Cheddar Man, estimated to be 9,000 years old, was found in Cheddar Gorge in 1903. Older remains from the Upper Late Palaeolithic era (12,000–13,000 years ago) have been found. There is some evidence of a Bronze Age field system at the Batts Combe quarry site. There is also evidence of Bronze Age barrows at the mound in the Longwood valley, which if man-made it <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> field system. The remains of a Roman villa have been excavated in {{the grounds of the}} current vicarage.|$|E
5|$|Five genetic {{types of}} HHT are recognized. Of these, three {{have been linked}} to {{particular}} genes, while the two remaining have currently only been associated with a particular locus. More than 80% of all cases of HHT are due to mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1. A total of over 600 different mutations is known. There <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> predominance of either type in particular populations, but the data are conflicting. MADH4 mutations, which cause colonic polyposis in addition to HHT, comprise about 2% of disease-causing mutations. Apart from MADH4, {{it is not clear whether}} mutations in ENG and ACVRL1 lead to particular symptoms, although some reports suggest that ENG mutations are more likely to cause lung problems while ACVRL1 mutations may cause more liver problems, and pulmonary hypertension may be a particular problem in people with ACVRL1 mutations. People with exactly the same mutations may have different nature and severity of symptoms, suggesting that additional genes or other risk factors may determine the rate at which lesions develop; these have not yet been identified.|$|E

30|$|Assuming {{traditional}} gender roles, it thus {{follows that}} the combined effect of CLM and education will differ {{for men and}} women. More generally, Predictions 2 and 3 regarding education depend on whether {{men and women are}} predominantly WiHo workers or employers of WiHo. The more they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on the employer side, the more the combined effect of education and CLM on couple formation <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> negative. The more they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> WiHo workers, the less CLM <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> affect couple formation of the college-educated.|$|R

5|$|Roman remains, {{possibly}} a signal station or watchtower, {{have been identified}} on the island by an electrical resistance survey. Accurate exploration and interpretation of the site is difficult as it was reused by builders in both the Victorian era and during World War II. A carved stone head found on the island in 1991 <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Celtic head from the Romano-British era, but may be from the Iron Age. In addition to shards of cooking pots from the Roman era, some luxury items have been identified including Arretine ware, La Tène style brooches, and an amphora dating from between 90 and 140AD which was made in southern Spain. There have also been shards of Castor ware. Fragments of pottery roofing and box flue tiles have been identified signifying {{the presence of a}} heating system and {{possibly a}} bath house. Roman coins from the reigns of Claudius Gothicus (268–270) and Tetricus I (271–273) have also been found.|$|E

25|$|As {{a symbol}} of cowardice, the white feather {{supposedly}} comes from cockfighting {{and the belief that}} a cockerel sporting a white feather in its tail <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> poor fighter. Pure-breed gamecocks do not show white feathers, so its presence indicates that the cockerel is an inferior cross-breed.|$|E
25|$|Tolls: a fee {{charged to}} travel via a road, bridge, tunnel, canal, {{waterway}} or other transportation facilities. Historically tolls {{have been used}} to pay for public bridge, road and tunnel projects. They have also been used in privately constructed transport links. The toll <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fixed charge, possibly graduated for vehicle type, or for distance on long routes.|$|E
3000|$|... ‘Growing space’ was {{selected}} as a ‘tree-level’ variable <b>to</b> <b>be</b> included in the model, as branch diameter <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> larger {{where there is a}} canopy gap (Maclaren 2009), suggesting that on average, branch diameter <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> related <b>to</b> the ‘growing space’ available to the tree.|$|R
50|$|Even at {{this level}} of {{classification}} there <b>are</b> conflicts <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resolved.

25|$|Because it {{is boring}} for games {{to be drawn}} out indefinitely, serious Abalone players tacitly agree to play aggressively. A player who forms a {{defensive}} wedge and makes no attempt to attack <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> novice who might lose anyway. Nevertheless, there remains the possibility of any competent player bringing the game to a standstill and successfully avoiding losing, even to a championship-level player.|$|E
25|$|Electronic analog {{computers}} {{typically have}} front panels with numerous jacks (single-contact sockets) that permit patch cords (flexible wires with plugs at both ends) {{to create the}} interconnections which define the problem setup. In addition, there are precision high-resolution potentiometers (variable resistors) for setting up (and, when needed, varying) scale factors. In addition, there <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> zero-center analog pointer-type meter for modest-accuracy voltage measurement. Stable, accurate voltage sources provide known magnitudes.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} speed U {{is that of}} the annular jet. The characteristic dimension D is {{the cavity}} diameter and it appears that both cavities have similar dimensions. Again, the Rossby number V <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> relevant dynamic number, since the operation of the inner cavity must be similar to that in the police whistle. It is likely that the vortex in the outer cavity is in antiphase with the inner cavity to amplify jet displacement and thus the sound output.|$|E
