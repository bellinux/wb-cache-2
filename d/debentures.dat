5|$|The total {{construction}} cost of {{the stadium}} was £121million, which was funded by private investment and £46million of public funds from the Millennium Commission, the sale of <b>debentures</b> to supporters (which offered guaranteed tickets in exchange for an interest-free loan), and loans. The development left the WRU heavily in debt.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1912, <b>debentures</b> were sold to Wood and Gandy Co. for $17,700, so five new, steel road graders were {{purchased}} from Hamilton Machinery Co....World War II ended...Victory bonds were cashed and a Crawler tractor with a carry-all scraper was purchased. The first motor patrol operator was hired at $125 per month. Snow removal became necessary so a V-plow attachment {{and a set of}} chains were added... Highway #14 had been reconstructed so the R.M. posted new signs for the towns at junctions..|$|E
5|$|The Claimant was now bankrupt. In 1870 his {{new legal}} {{advisers}} launched a novel fundraising scheme: Tichborne Bonds, {{an issue of}} 1,000 <b>debentures</b> of £100 face value, the holders {{of which would be}} repaid with interest when the Claimant obtained his inheritance. About £40,000 was raised, though the bonds quickly traded at a considerable discount and were soon being exchanged for derisory sums. The scheme allowed the Claimant to continue to meet his living and legal expenses for a while. After a delay while the Franco-Prussian War and its aftermath prevented key witnesses from leaving Paris, the civil case that the Claimant hoped would confirm his identity finally came to court in May 1871.|$|E

50|$|The House of Lords {{upheld the}} Court of Appeal. Viscount Maugham gave the leading {{judgment}} holding that the loan was a <b>debenture.</b> He added {{that it could}} be a <b>debenture</b> for this provision of the Act, even if a mortgage might not be a <b>debenture</b> under every provision of the Act.|$|R
50|$|In sport, a <b>debenture</b> {{is defined}} as a {{certificate}} of agreement of loans which is given under the company's stamp and carries an undertaking that the <b>debenture</b> holder will get a fixed return (fixed on the basis of interest rates) and the principal amount whenever the <b>debenture</b> matures. The terms may also include ancillary benefits such as an option to buy tickets at a favourable price, as well as or instead of interest. The term stems from the financial concept of a <b>debenture.</b>|$|R
5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 20,000 tickets, {{out of a}} total capacity of 52,063. The remaining seats are accounted for by Hampden Park debenture holders, hospitality, sponsors, media and segregation areas. In excess of 1,000 unused <b>debentures</b> were distributed to each club. The allocation was enough to provide for the season ticket holders of each club, with Hearts having 10,000 and Hibs 7,500 approximately, although both clubs anticipated that there would be little or no need for a general public sale. Hearts decided to sell tickets using their loyalty points system, while Hibs connected their allocation to sales of season tickets and memberships. Due to high demand, Hearts tightened the criteria needed for a ticket during the sales process. Regular tickets cost £35 or £28 for adults and £10 for children under 15 years old.|$|E
5|$|Currently, Wales {{play all}} their home matches at the 74,500 {{capacity}} Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, {{which is also}} Wales' national stadium. The Millennium Stadium was first conceived in 1994, when a group redevelopment committee was set up. It was decided to replace the National Stadium at Cardiff Arms Park after a review found {{it was out of}} date; new legislation also required stadia to be all seated. Construction began in September 1997, and was completed by June 1999, in time for the Rugby World Cup. The construction cost the WRU £126million, which was funded by private investment, £46million of public funds from the National Lottery, the sale of <b>debentures</b> to supporters (which offered guaranteed tickets in exchange for an interest-free loan), and loans. While the new ground was being built, Wales used the old Wembley Stadium for their home matchesa deal reciprocated during construction of the new Wembley, when FA Cup finals were held at the Millennium Stadium.|$|E
5|$|David Murray {{acquired}} {{control of}} Rangers in November 1988. Argyle House, a £4 million extension behind the Govan Stand, was opened in 1990. This added executive boxes, office space and hospitality suites. A further series of developments {{was started in}} the early 1990s to increase capacity to over 50,000. Murray commissioned architect Gareth Hutchison {{to find a way}} of adding a third tier to the Main Stand. This was a highly complex process, as the Main Stand facade had become a listed building and Murray wanted the existing structure to remain open during construction. The contractors removed the original roof and added a temporary cover while the work carried on above. The Club Deck, which cost approximately £20 million, was opened with a league match against Dundee United in December 1991. The redevelopment of the Main Stand was partially financed by a Football Trust grant of £2 million and a debenture issue that raised £8.5 million. Ordinary fans bought <b>debentures</b> for between £1,000 and £1,650 each, which guaranteed the right to buy season tickets for at least 30 years, along with some other minor benefits.|$|E

Glen Eden issued a third <b>debenture</b> to Downsview and Russell carried on the business, losing a further $500,000. First City claimed that Russell (as receiver) and Downsview Nominees (as prior <b>debenture</b> holder) had violated their duties to First City to: ...|$|R

Pursuant to the <b>debenture</b> the chargee advanced the sume of £200 to the company.|$|R
25|$|The organisers of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, The All England Club, issue their <b>debenture</b> holders {{a ticket}} for {{each day of the}} tournament.

5|$|In 1860 the Clifton Bridge Company {{was set up}} {{to oversee}} the final stages of {{completion}} and manage the operation of the bridge. They paid £50 each year to the trustees who gradually purchased the shares in the company. The revenues from tolls were minimal initially as there was not much traffic; however, this increased after 1920 with greater car ownership. In 1949 the trustees purchased all the outstanding shares and <b>debentures.</b> The bridge is managed by a charitable trust, originally formed by the Society of Merchant Venturers following Vick's bequest. The trust was authorised to manage the bridge and collect tolls by Acts of Parliament in 1952, 1980 and 1986. A toll of £0.50 has been levied on vehicles since 2007, but the £0.05 toll that the Act allows for cyclists or pedestrians is not collected. Human toll collectors were replaced by automated machines in 1975. The tolls are used to pay for the upkeep of the bridge, including the strengthening of the chain anchor points, which was done in 1925 and 1939, and regular painting and maintenance, which is carried out from a motorised cradle slung beneath the deck. By 2008 over 4 million vehicles crossed the bridge each year.|$|E
25|$|Thanks to {{a handful}} of wealthy sympathisers, the sale of <b>debentures</b> was more {{successful}} but the identity of some of the debenture holders suggests that many of these were donations rather than true investments. The first 20 <b>debentures</b> were bought by Edward Martyn, president of Sinn Féin from 1905 to 1908 and patron of many of Griffith's enterprises. John Sweetman, second president of Sinn Féin bought <b>debentures</b> 21 to 70, and the third most important investor, holder of 50 <b>debentures,</b> was Roger Casement, also a patron of many nationalist organisations until his execution {{in the aftermath of the}} 1916 Rising.|$|E
25|$|The All England Club, {{through its}} {{subsidiary}} The All England Lawn Tennis Ground plc, issues <b>Debentures</b> to tennis fans {{every five years}} {{to raise funds for}} capital expenditure. Fans who invest thus in the club receive a pair of tickets for every day of the Wimbledon Championships for the five years the investment lasts. Only debenture holders are permitted to sell on their tickets to third parties and demand for <b>debentures</b> has increased in recent years, {{to such an extent that}} they are even traded on the London Stock Exchange.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the railway}} was {{successful}} in technical and service terms, it is doubtful whether the shareholders got any of their money back and Brogdens had invested a lot. Out of 8,678 shares issued (as of August 1866), Alexander had taken 792. By November 1867 £150,000 had been raised by shares and only £2,600 by <b>debentures.</b> In October 1868, shareholders funds were unchanged but <b>debentures</b> stood at £180,000, loans £17,500 and creditors at £65,000. It follows that Alexander's share investment, now lost, had been about £13,700, plus one share of £1,000 in the Mont Cenis Concessionary Company which had been formed earlier to negotiate concessions from the two governments.|$|E
