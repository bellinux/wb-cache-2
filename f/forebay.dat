40|$|Induction of mild {{turbulence}} {{and increased}} water velocity in slowly moving water in dam <b>forebays</b> is proposed {{as a way}} to attract and guide downstream-migrating juvenile salmonids to dam bypasses. Attraction flows have been used successfully for decades at the downstream ends of fish ladders to attract adult salmonids to fish ladder entrances. Similar hydraulic concepts for simulating a turbulent stream have generally not been implemented to divert juvenile migrants into dam bypasses and away from damaging turbine intakes. Turbulent flow appears to he a normal feature of water movement in natural rivers that guides and assists juvenile salmon migration. It is hypothesized that enhancement of turbulent flow in selected zones of quiescent dam <b>forebays</b> would spatially expand the opportunities for fish to discover entrances to fish bypasses (such as surface-flow bypasses). A 2 ̆ 7 trail of turbulence 2 ̆ 7 could lead fish to surface bypass entrances. Enhanced turbulence at bypass entrances and within bypass channels could also improve the effectiveness of juvenile salmonid guidance and retention in the bypasses. Turbulence could be enhanced by passive (using existing flow momentum or head directed by vanes) and active (pumped water jets or propellers) methods, which can be tailored to specific situations. Initial tests have confirmed the validity of the concept...|$|R

25|$|Because Black Eagle Dam is an {{overflow}} dam, it {{is common}} for debris to jam against the dam or obstruct the penstock intakes. Driftwood and logs are the most common forms of debris, but unusual objects such as boat docks, bowling balls, canoes, hot tubs, and small wooden and steel sheds and buildings also sometimes become lodged against the dam. Removing hollow items can be dangerous, because the water pressure against them can cause them to implode. In addition to large amounts of driftwood, about 100 animal carcasses (cattle, deer, dogs, and various small animals) become lodged against the dam or the penstock intake screens each year. Floating screens {{at the entrance to the}} <b>forebay</b> catch many items, as do the penstock intake screens. Workers use a crane to remove items from these screens, and bury the items retrieved at a landfill. Dam operators also use a yellow civilian version of the Alvis Stalwart amphibious vehicle to remove objects, and to maintain the dam. (This vehicle caused a stir in Great Falls in June 2006, when local residents driving on a nearby road mistook the vehicle for a sport utility vehicle which had fallen into the water.)

40|$|As a river {{flows through}} shallow {{littoral}} regions such as wetlands, <b>forebays,</b> and side arms, {{the temperature of}} the water is modified through atmospheric heat exchange. This process, which we call thermal mediation, can control the initial fate of river-borne nutrient and contaminant fluxes within a lake or reservoir. This paper presents temperature observations that demonstrate the occurrence of thermal mediation and directly support the theoretical results derived by Andradóttir and Nepf [2000]. The measurements show that the wetland warms the river inflow by approximately 1 – 3 [degrees]C during summer and fall nonstorm conditions. Less thermal mediation occurs during storms, both because the residence time is significantly reduced and because the wetland circulation shifts from laterally well mixed (low flows) to short-circuiting (storms). The dead-zone model can simulate both these regimes and the transition between the regimes and is therefore a good choice for wetland modeling.

40|$|Utility {{companies}} and regulatory agencies {{are interested in}} understanding juvenile salmon swimming patterns as they approach hydropower dams because it can allow them to assess fish bypass efficiency and conduct fish survival studies. A model capable of predicting juvenile salmon swim paths can assist {{in the design of}} fish bypasses and diversion structures. This thesis presents a mechanistic model tailored to simulate swimming patterns of juvenile salmon swimming in <b>forebays,</b> tailraces, and free-flowing rivers. The model integrates information on juvenile salmon behavior at both field and laboratory scale and literature on juvenile salmon swimming capabilities. Simulated fish swim paths are determined by solving Newton 2 ̆ 7 s Second Law. Most of the model parameters are represented by probability distributions. Behavioral responses are triggered for the most part by the flow acceleration and pressure. The model uses conditional probability distributions of thrust magnitude and direction, given flow acceleration. Simulated fish select a swimming direction referenced to the flow velocity vector. To consider juvenile salmon 2 ̆ 7 s tendency to coast with the flow, the model intersperses periods of active swimming and gliding. Chinook salmon measured swim paths were analyzed. The flow variables at the fish locations were obtained from CFD simulations. Juvenile salmon mean thrust was determined from solving Newton 2 ̆ 7 s Second Law at every measured location. Results show that as flow acceleration increases, the juvenile salmon average thrust increases and the probability of gliding decreases.

40|$|For {{many fish}} species, powerplants are {{a barrier to}} their natural {{downstream}} migration. Numerical models are developed {{to better understand the}} complex flow field in hydropower <b>forebays</b> and tailraces, and thus reduce the fish stresses associated with the passage through dams. Free surface models can simulate flows including the shape and evolution of the free surface. Improvements in the computer power have recently made it possible to tackle free surface computations of complex geometries with highly 3 D flows. In the field of hydraulic engineering, the free surface models are not yet widely applied but steadily developed ([1], [3], [4], [5], [6]). This paper presents a CFD model developed using the commercial code FLUENT to predict the flow field in hydraulic structures. The model is based on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, with a standard εκ − turbulence model. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is used to predict free surface elevations [2]. A proportional controller is implemented in the model to achieve a target flow rate at the exits. The resulting equation is implemented using User Defined Functions (UDFs). The model is used to predict the flow field inside a fish surface collector at Rocky Reach dam. The model includes two dewatering channels, with side wall fish screens for each channel, and a pump station. The comparison of the numerical model results with depth averaged velocity field data and free surface elevation shows very good agreement. The model was also used to study the forces on a removable spillway weir structure and possible reduction of the spillway capacity during probably maximum flood in Little Goose dam. Free surface computations were also carried out to estimate the spillway jet regime and the free surface shape in tailraces. The model has demonstrated to work very well for flow regime predictions in Wanapum, Little Goose and Wells dams...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the literature on}} fish behavior {{as it relates to}} passage of fish near or through hydropower turbines. Our goal was to foster compatibility of engineered systems with the normal behavior patterns of fish species and life stages such that passage into turbines and injury in passage are minimized. In particular, we focused on aspects of fish behavior {{that could be used for}} computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of fish trajectories through turbine systems. Salmon smolts approaching dams are generally surface oriented and follow flow. They can be diverted from turbines by spills or bypasses, with varying degrees of effectiveness. Smolts typically become disoriented in dam <b>forebays.</b> Those smolts drawn into turbine intakes orient vertically to the ceilings but are horizontally distributed more evenly, except as they are affected by intake-specific turbulence and vortices. Smolts often enter intakes while oriented with their heads upstream, but they may change orientation in the flow fields of the intake. Nonsalmonids most often enter intakes from the vicinities of shorelines, and they do so episodically, which suggests accidental capture of schools (often of juveniles or in cold water) and little behavioral control during turbine passage. Models of fish trajectories should not assume neutral buoyancy throughout the time period during which a fish passes through a turbine, largely because of pressure effects on swim bladders and the resulting compensatory behavior. Fish use their lateral line system to sense obstacles and to change their orientation, but this sensory-response system may not be effective in the rapid passage times and complex pressure regimes of turbine systems. The effects of preexisting stress levels on fish performance in turbine passage (especially as they affect trajectories) are not known but may be important. There are practical limits of observation and measurement of fish and flows in the proximity of turbines that may inhibit the development of much information that is germane to developing a more fish-friendly turbine. We provide recommendations for CFD modelers of fish passage and for additional research...|$|R
40|$|Total {{dissolved}} gas (TDG) supersaturation in waters released at hydropower dams can cause gas bubble trauma in fisheries resulting in physical injuries and eyeball protrusion {{that can lead}} to mortality. Elevated TDG pressures in hydropower releases are generally caused by the entrainment of air in spillway releases and the subsequent exchange of atmospheric gasses into solution during passage through the stilling basin. The network of dams throughout the Columbia River Basin (CRB) are managed for irrigation, hydropower production, flood control, navigation, and fish passage that frequently result in both voluntary and involuntary spillway releases. These dam operations are constrained by state and federal water quality standards for TDG saturation which balance the benefits of spillway operations designed for Endangered Species Act (ESA) -listed fisheries versus the degradation to water quality as defined by TDG saturation. In the 1970 s, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), under the federal Clean Water Act (Section 303 (d)), established a criterion not to exceed the TDG saturation level of 110 % in order to protect freshwater and marine aquatic life. The states of Washington and Oregon have adopted special water quality standards for TDG saturation in the tailrace and <b>forebays</b> of hydropower facilities on the Columbia and Snake Rivers where spillway operations support fish passage objectives. The physical processes that affect TDG exchange at hydropower facilities have been studied throughout the CRB in site-specific studies and routine water quality monitoring programs. These data have been used to quantify the relationship between project operations, structural properties, and TDG exchange. These data have also been used to develop predictive models of TDG exchange to support real-time TDG management decisions. These empirically based predictive models have been developed for specific projects and account for both the fate of spillway and powerhouse flows in the tailrace channel and resultant exchange in route to the next downstream dam. Currently, there exists a need to summarize the general finding from operational and structural TDG abatement programs conducted throughout the CRB and {{for the development of a}} generalized prediction model that pools data collected at multiple projects with similar structural attributes. A generalized TDG exchange model can be tuned to specific projects and coupled with water regulation models to allow the formulation of optimal daily water regulation schedules subject to water quality constraints for TDG supersaturation. A generalized TDG exchange model can also be applied to other hydropower dams that affect TDG pressures in tailraces and can be used to develop alternative operational and structural measures to minimize TDG generation. It is proposed to develop a methodology for predicting TDG levels downstream of hydropower facilities with similar structural properties as a function of a set of variables that affect TDG exchange; such as tailwater depth, spill discharge and pattern, project head, and entrainment of powerhouse releases. TDG data from hydropower facilities located throughout the northwest region of the United States will be used to identify relationships between TDG exchange and relevant dependent variables. Data analysis and regression techniques will be used to develop predictive TDG exchange expressions for various structural categories...|$|R
