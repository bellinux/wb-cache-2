5000|$|The company took a {{lead in the}} {{mechanisation}} {{of printing}} cloth using a process that had been developed by Thomas Bell. [...] In 1783 Bell patented a method of printing on fabric from <b>engraved</b> <b>cylinders,</b> and by 1785 {{he was able to}} print in six colours by this process. [...] Before that time the printing of fabric had been by hand, and the hand printers had been demanding higher wages. [...] During the 1780s the firm was the largest calico printer in Lancashire, and was [...] "one of the largest cotton manufacturing enterprises {{in the early stages of}} the Industrial Revolution". [...] The printing process was carried out at their factories at Bannister Hall and at Mosney, both in Walton-le-Dale, near Preston, Lancashire. The firm also had a large mill at Clitheroe, a factory, warehouse and offices in Manchester, a warehouse in London, and were involved in bleaching cloth at Hoghton. It also owned a coal mine at Standish to provide fuel for its enterprises, and commissioned work from handloom weavers working in their own homes (out-workers).|$|R

5000|$|This is {{the first}} {{cartridge}} revolver made by Allen and Wheelock, {{and one of the}} first cartridge revolvers from any manufacturer (competing with the Smith and Wesson model 1). It is a single-action seven-shot revolver in [...]22 Rimfire (black powder equivalent of the modern [...]22 Short). It features the side-hammer of the early percussion revolvers and a spur trigger. Empty cases were removed by removing the cylinder, and using the cylinder pin to push the case out of the cylinder. There are many variations typically organized into six models, though all share the size and critical design features. Most were made with a 3-inch barrel. The first through fourth models have <b>engraved</b> <b>cylinders,</b> with crossed rifles, a horse and rider, military articles, an Indian with bow and a sailing ship. Allen obtained a patent granted in 1858, and it is likely that production began in 1857. Production continued until 1863, when production of all cartridge revolvers was halted by the lawsuit described previously. Production resumed upon expiry of the Rollin White patent in 1869, though likely from parts manufactured in the earlier period. After Allen's death in 1871, production continued for some period under the new company name Forehand and Wadsworth.|$|R
5000|$|Die {{grinders}} and rotary {{tools are}} handheld power tools used for grinding, sanding, honing, polishing, or machining material (typically metal, but also plastic or wood). All such tools are conceptually similar, with no bright {{dividing line between}} die grinders and rotary tools, although the die grinder name tends {{to be used for}} pneumatically driven heavy-duty versions whereas the rotary tool name tends to be used for electric lighter-duty versions. Flexible shaft drive versions also exist. The die grinder name comes from one of their earliest and archetypal applications, tool and die work, where they were used to create the precise contours of dies or molds. Especially before the advent of widespread CNC usage, they were heavily relied upon for contouring via manual skill comparable to a sculptor's. CNC now provides much of the contouring for die and mold interior surfaces, but die grinders are still very useful for hundreds of cutting needs, from sculpture-like contouring in the absence of CNC, to cut-off of bar stock, to any of the cutting and grinding needs of fabrication, such as in the work of welders, boilermakers, millwrights, ironworkers (steel erectors), sheet metal workers (such as auto body workers and HVAC technicians), to woodworking (especially cabinet making), hacking, and other hobby or business pursuits. Die grinders are often used for <b>engraving,</b> <b>cylinder</b> head porting, and general shaping of a part.|$|R
25|$|The audio {{fidelity}} {{of a sound}} groove is debatably {{better if}} it is <b>engraved</b> on a <b>cylinder</b> due to better linear tracking. This was not resolved until the advent of RIAA standards in the early 1940s—by which time {{it had already been}} rendered academic, as cylinder production stopped with Edison's last efforts in October 1929.|$|R
50|$|While {{the press}} is in operation, the <b>engraved</b> <b>cylinder</b> is {{partially}} immersed in the ink tray, filling the recessed cells. As the cylinder rotates, it draws excess ink onto its surface and into the cells. Acting as a squeegee, the doctor blade scrapes the cylinder before it makes contact with the paper, removing the excess ink from the non-printing (non-recessed) areas and leaving in the cells {{the right amount of}} ink required. The position of the blade relative to the nip is normally variable.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cylinder}} of this revolver is {{engraved with}} {{a scene of}} {{the victory of the}} Second Texas Navy at the Battle of Campeche on May 16, 1843. The Texas Navy had purchased the earlier Colt Paterson Revolver, but this was Colt's first major success in the gun trade; the naval theme of the <b>engraved</b> <b>cylinder</b> of the Colt 1851 Navy revolver was Colt's gesture of appreciation. The engraving was provided by Waterman Ormsby. Despite the [...] "Navy" [...] designation, the revolver was chiefly purchased by civilians and military land forces.|$|E

50|$|Gravure {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} {{made of steel}} and plated with copper, though other materials, e.g. ceramics can also be used. The desired pattern is achieved by engraving with a laser or a diamond tool, or by chemical etching. If the cylinder is chemically etched, a resist (in {{the form of a}} negative image) is transferred to the cylinder before etching. The resist protects the non-image areas of the cylinder from the etchant. After etching, the resist is stripped off. The operation is analogous to the manufacture of printed circuit boards. Following <b>engraving,</b> the <b>cylinder</b> is proofed and tested, reworked if necessary, and then chrome plated.|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that the gravure process {{provides}} the best quality printed materials and the fastest production speed. The gravure process, {{as a matter of}} fact, is the only process which can utilize fully digital imaging technology. For instance, the Helio-Klischograph Model K 201 and K 202 incorporated with the Hell Chromacom System can <b>engrave</b> gravure <b>cylinders</b> directly without using any halftone films or bromides. Hell Co., Ltd., moreover, has been developing the electron beam engraving technique which employs digital imaging technology to <b>engrave</b> gravure <b>cylinders.</b> On the other hand, Crosfield Electronics Co., Ltd. introduced the Lasergravure process which also utilizes digital imaging technology to <b>engrave</b> gravure <b>cylinders.</b> However, these techniques represent very high costs for gravure printers. Only large companies can afford such investments. The gravure process, generally speaking, is the most expensive process, mainly due to the costs of printing cylinder preparation. To compensate for costly prepress, it is therefore used for high production runs. This constraint is the main disadvantage of the gravure process and has caused the gravure market to become smaller than its competitors web offset and flexography. Research in web offset and flexo has been successful in developing higher print quality, faster production speed and lower costs. Therefore, there are some companies which have been developing a method of making photopolymer-coated cylinders for gravure to reduce, not only the costs of the metal cylinders and the sophisticated equipment, but also the production time. The company that provided photopolymer material for this thesis claimed that its products can be commercially made as gravure cylinders. This photopolymer can be imaged by a conventional ultraviolet fluorescent lamp. Both the company and the author agreed that it might be feasible to utilize digital imaging technology to image this photopolymer. The author selected the Hell Chromagraph 399 ER Laser Scanner as a digital imaging source to image onto this photopolymer. After enormous efforts in the experiments, the argon ion laser on the Hell 399 ER was not able to image onto this photopolymer regardless of the laser intensity and the length of the exposure time because the spectral sensitivity of this photopolymer did not match the argon ion laser. The author, however, conducted further experiments to prove that this photopolymer can be imaged by a high-power UV-argon ion laser, but it is, at present, impractical for gravure printers. Some recommendations for further studies in this area are suggested...|$|R
25|$|During the {{preceding}} Uruk period, {{there was a}} wide variety in scenes <b>engraved</b> on <b>cylinder</b> seals. This variety disappeared {{at the start of}} the third millennium, to be replaced by an almost exclusive focus on mythological and cultural scenes in Lower Mesopotamia and the Diyala region. During the ED I period, seal designs included geometric motifs and stylized pictograms. Later on, combat scenes between real and mythological animals became the dominant theme, together with scenes of heroes fighting animals. Their exact meaning is unclear. Common mythological creatures include anthropomorphic bulls and scorpion-men. Real creatures include lions and eagles. Some anthropomorphic creatures are probably deities, as they wear a horned tiara, which was a symbol of divinity.|$|R
40|$|According to the {{previous}} study, the printability of electromechanical <b>engraved</b> <b>cylinder</b> and laser <b>engraved</b> <b>cylinder</b> were different in terms of density, tone reproduction and mottle. In this study, the missing dots of two different engraved cell types were investigated. It showed that different cell structures had strong effect to ink transferring and the characteristics of missing dots. Lasers engraved cells were less affected by ESA (electrostatic assist). When there was no ESA applied, the laser engraved cells showed less missing dot area, which indicated better ink release from spherical shaped cells.

40|$|June 21 - 20, 1987 The {{rotogravure}} {{printing process}} consists of rotating an <b>engraved</b> <b>cylinder</b> in a bath of ink, removing ink from the unengraved {{portions of the}} cylinder with a doctor blade, and then contacting a moving web with the cylinder {{in such a manner}} as to transfer the ink contained in the engravings to the web. The web then passes through a dryer. The arrangement of a typical rotogravure press unit is shown in Figure 1. The cylinders used are engraved either mechanically or by chemical etching. In both cases, tiny discrete pits called "cells " are created in the cylinder. Each cell prints a dot. Typically, there are 20 - 30, 000 cells per square inch of engraved surf ace. The advantages of the rotogravure process include its capability for good quality four color process work and its ability to be operated at high web speeds. Typical web speeds utilize...|$|E
50|$|Rotogravure (roto or gravure for short) {{is a type}} of {{intaglio}} printing process, which involves engraving the image onto an image carrier.

2500|$|Examples of {{contemporary}} uses for engraving include creating text on jewellery, such as pendants {{or on the}} inside of engagement- and wedding rings to include text such as the name of the partner, or adding a winner's name to a sports trophy. [...] Another application of modern engraving is found in the printing industry. There, every day thousands of pages are mechanically <b>engraved</b> onto rotogravure <b>cylinders,</b> typically a steel base with a copper layer of about 0.1mm in which the image is transferred. After engraving the image is protected with an approximately 6µm chrome layer. Using this process the image will survive for over a million copies in high speed printing presses. [...] Engraving machines such as GUN BOW (one of the leading engraving brands) are the best examples of hand engraving tools, although this type of machine is typically not used for fine hand engraving.|$|R
50|$|The Naval Battle of Campeche {{took place}} on April 30, 1843, and May 16, 1843. The battle {{featured}} the most advanced warships of its day, including the Mexican steamer Guadalupe and the equally formidable Moctezuma which engaged a squadron of vessels from the Republic of Yucatan and the Republic of Texas. The latter force consisted of the Texas Navy flagship sloop-of-war Austin, commanded by Commodore Edwin Ward Moore, the brig Wharton, and several schooners and five gunboats from the Republic of Yucatán, commanded by former Texas Navy Captain James D. Boylan. Texas had declared its independence in 1836 but by 1843 Mexico had refused to recognize it. In Yucatán, a similar rebellion had begun and was fought off-and-on from 1836 to 1846.

40|$|The {{printing}} {{industry is a}} growing market for laser applications with {{a wide spectrum of}} different kinds of lasers having been established. This paper focuses on the precise micro structuring of gravure, flexo, and embossing print forms by direct laser ablation. The principle of gravure printing is the direct ink transfer from an ink source to the print substrate by small 3 -dimensional cells engraved into the surface of a <b>cylinder.</b> Direct laser <b>engraving</b> into metallic <b>cylinders</b> is performed with a high power Q-switched Nd:YAG laser system tuned for high reproducibility and stability of the mean pulse energy (σ 2 < 1 %). An exact modulation technique allows fast variation and precise calibration of the energy of each single laser pulse as well as active modulation of the intensity profile of the beam. This method permits to set diameter and depth of each cell independently from pulse to pulse at a rate of 70 kHz. The aspect ratio and the shape of each single cell can therefore be defined freely for each laser pulse controlled by digital image data. Thus the cell shape can be optimized for the best ink transfer characteristic on different print substrates. ...|$|R
40|$|Gravure is {{the major}} {{printing}} process used for publication such as long-run magazine, catalogs, newspaper, and miscellaneous commercial printing. In gravure printing processes, color proofing is {{for the purpose of}} checking the color to ensure that it is as desired, before proceeding to <b>cylinder</b> <b>engraving.</b> Recently, the use of inkjet digital proofing gained popularity due to its benefits of high speed, wider color gamut, and affordable prices for a device. Proofing on the actual production stock more closely predicts print outcome. However, paper properties have significant effect on the image reproduction for proofing processes. Working with different inks and devices, the actual production printing substrate can have a very different color gamut and behave differently in the digital proofing process. The color capability of a digital proofing system influences color gamut and performance, which in turn affects accuracy of color for the press to match. This study discusses the color reproduction of digital proofing {{from the point of view}} paper properties. Publication printing substrates and manufacturer recommend proofing paper were tested on the Epson Stylus Pro 4000 printer and Xerox Phaser 8550 printer.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple alternative {{for the analysis}} and evaluation of ultrasonic scattering from arbitrary formed inclusions in materials. The basis for this are glass samples. Their sound velocity (longitudinal and transversal) can be adjusted by {{the composition of the}} glass so that it will be similar to the sound velocity of e. g. titanium alloy Ti 6246. The propagation of the sound fields in both materials is then comparable. Using laser engraving arbitrary formed three dimensional structures/voids can be built in glass. The surface of these internal structures consists of many micro cracks. By varying the micro crack concentration the sound transmission and reflection can be adjusted. By this means the ultrasonic scattering of impurity inclusions can be simulated. For verification different laser <b>engraved</b> voids (spheres, <b>cylinders</b> and ellipsoids) were built up in glass samples. They were inspected using focused ultrasonic probes. For comparison a titanium sample (Ti 6246) containing carbide and quartz inclusions was produced. Additionally the experimental situations were calculated using numerical simulation. Experimental and simulation results show that the correlation of ultrasonic scattering between laser engravings in glass samples and inclusions in titanium is good. Given that the production of glass samples with laser engravings is inexpensive, fast and reproducible, they offer a practical method to perform POD analysis...|$|R

Stronger to accommodate the more powerful cartridge, the [...]32 caliber followed the design cues of the [...]22 in being a single-action, spur trigger revolver. The cylinder accommodated six cartridges, and barrels could be had in either three, four, or five inch lengths. <b>Engraving</b> on the <b>cylinder</b> was a country scenes with dogs chasing a rabbit. There are three 'models' with detail improvements, though the basic design remained unchanged. Cylinder, and consequently frame, length grew from [...]905 inch to [...]940 inch to 1.2 inches. Production likely began in 1858, and ceased in 1863 per the patent suit described above. Production, or at least assembly, resumed presumably at the expiration of the Rollin White patent as a catalog from 1871 offers them at $9.25. A patent was granted 1860 to reduce drag on the recoil shield applied to this revolver as well as the lipfire revolvers. A later patent with a simplified action was granted in 1861. With the solid frame design, these revolvers were far stronger than the contemporary Smith and Wesson Model 2. In fact, the author would challenge that the design is much more sophisticated than the contemporary Smith & Wesson. Though it cannot be confirmed, it likely beat the Smith & Wesson Model 2 to market.|$|R
40|$|Laser {{processing}} {{is generally}} known for low thermal influence, precise energy processing {{and the possibility}} to ablate every type of material independent on hardness and vaporisation temperature. The use of ultra-short pulsed lasers offers new possibilities in the manufacturing of high end products with extra high processing qualities. For achieving a sufficient and economical processing speed, high average power is needed. To scale the power for industrial uses the picosecond laser system has been developed, which consists of a seeder, a preamplifier and an end amplifier. With the oscillator/amplifier system more than 400 W average power and maximum pulse energy 1 mJ was obtained. For study of high speed processing of large embossing metal roller two different ps laser systems have been integrated into a <b>cylinder</b> <b>engraving</b> machine. One of the ps lasers has an average power of 80 W while the other has 300 W. With this high power ps laser fluencies of up to 30 J/cm 2 at pulse repetition rates in the multi MHz range have been achieved. Different materials (Cu, Ni, Al, steel) have been explored for parameters like ablation rate per pulse, ablation geometry, surface roughness, influence of pulse overlap and number of loops. An enhanced ablation quality and an effective ablation rate of 4 mm 3 /min have been achieved by using different scanning systems and an optimized processing strategy. The max. achieved volume rate is 20 mm 3 /min...|$|R
