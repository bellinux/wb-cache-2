The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine performance within four components of executive function (EF) in contemporaneously recruited samples of girls and boys with ADHD. Fifty-six children with ADHD (26 girls) and 90 controls (42 girls), ages 8 – 13, were administered neuropsychological tests emphasizing response inhibition, response preparation, working memory, and planning/shifting.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dependent cocaine users {{consistently}} display increased trait impulsivity on self-report questionnaires {{and less}} consistently exhibit <b>elevated</b> <b>motor</b> impulsivity in some behavioral tasks. However, trait and behavioral impulsivity measures have rarely been investigated in recreational users. Therefore, we examined self-reported trait and motor impulsivities in recreational and dependent cocaine users {{to clarify the}} role of impulse control in cocaine addiction and non-dependent cocaine use. METHODS: We investigated relatively pure recreational (n= 68) and dependent (n= 30) cocaine users, as well as psychostimulant-naïve controls (n= 68), with self-report questionnaires (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11; Temperament and Character Inventory) and behavioral tasks (Rapid Visual Information Processing Task; Stop-Signal Task). RESULTS: Compared with controls, recreational and dependent cocaine users displayed higher trait impulsivity and novelty seeking scores on self-report questionnaires. Trait impulsivity scores were strongly {{associated with an increased}} number of symptoms of depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and correlated significantly with long-term cocaine intake parameters. By contrast, none of the behavioral motor impulsivity measures showed significant group effects or correlated with cocaine use parameters. The correlations among the self-report measures were high, but self-reports were scarcely correlated with behavioral task measures. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that relatively pure cocaine users already display increased trait impulsivity at a recreational level of use. However, the results do not indicate any cocaine-related elevation of behavioral impulsivity in terms of motor or response inhibition. In summary, our data imply that elevated trait impulsivity is not a specific feature of dependent cocaine use. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

This dissertation investigated characteristics, contributory causes, and factors which increase the injury severity of young driver crashes in Kansas by comparing them with more experienced drivers. Crash data {{were obtained from the}} Kansas Department of Transportation. Young drivers were divided into two groups: 15 - 19 years (teen) and 20 - 24 years (young adult) for a detailed investigation. Using data from 2006 to 2009, frequencies, percentages, and crash rates were calculated for each characteristic and contributory cause. Contingency table analysis and odds ratios (OR) analysis were carried out to identify overly represented factors of young-driver crashes compared to experienced drivers. Young drivers {{were more likely to be}} involved in crashes due to failure to yield-right-of way, disregarding traffic signs/signals, turning, or lane changing, compared to experienced drivers. Ordered logistic regression models were developed to identify severity affecting factors in young driver crashes. According to model results, factors that decreased injury severity of the driver were seat belt use, driving at low speeds, driving newer vehicles, and driving with an adult passenger. The models also showed that alcohol involvement, driving on high-posted-speed-limit roadways, ejection at the time of crash, and trapping at the time of crash can increase young drivers’ injury severity. Based on identified critical factors, countermeasure ideas were suggested to improve the safety of young drivers. It is important for teen drivers and parents/guardians to gain better understanding about these critical factors that are helpful in preventing crashes and minimizing driving risk. Parents/guardians can consider high-risk conditions such as driving during dark, during weekends, on rural roads, on wet road surfaces, and on roadways with high speed limits, for planning teen driving. Protective devices, crash-worthy cars, and safer road infrastructures, such as rumble strips, and forgiving roadsides, will particularly reduce young drivers’ risk. Predictable traffic situations and low complexity resulting from improved road infrastructure are beneficial for young drivers. The effectiveness of Kansas Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) system needs to be investigated in the future...|$|R

Multiple linear regression associated total motor score, motor domains, and individual motor items with estimated diagnosis and striatal volumes. <b>Elevated</b> total <b>motor</b> scores at baseline were associated with higher genetic probability of disease diagnosis {{in the near future}} (partial R(2) 0. 14, P < 0. 0001) and smaller striatal volumes (partial R(2) 0. 15, P < 0. 0001).

40|$|It {{has been}} known for some time that {{eccentric}} exercise produces significant muscle damage resulting in changes in muscle structure and function, leading to a fall in maximal force production, a rise in passive tension, as well as delayed-onset muscle soreness. The majority of studies to date have focussed on examining the structural changes in the muscle, however, little is known about how the nervous system responds to eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. This thesis has investigated for the first time changes at the level of single motor unit activity following eccentric exercise, which provides specific information about the activity of spinal motor neurons that can reveal details {{of the nature of the}} neural adaptations to repeated eccentric contractions. Muscle damage was induced in experiments in Chapters 2 and 3 by controlled lowering of a hand-held load, requiring eccentric contraction of the elbow flexor muscles, and in Chapter 4, by maximal voluntary eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors on an isokinetic dynamometer, to induce a 40 % reduction in MVC force in all subjects. As well as an extended reduction in MVC force, I found consistent with results from previous studies a reduction in relaxed elbow joint angle (indicative of a rise in passive tension) up to 24 -hrs after the exercise and delayed-onset muscle soreness a day later. An increase in sub-maximal biceps brachii EMG activity and increased force fluctuations for up to 24 -hrs after the exercise was also found, along with increased antagonist activity from triceps brachii EMG immediately after eccentric exercise, confirming results from other studies. Following a single bout of eccentric exercise, I found an increase in correlated motor unit activity (motor unit synchronization and coherence; Chapter 2) and a reduction in the force at which motor units were recruited (Chapter 3) that lasted for at least 24 hours after the exercise. Minimum motor unit discharge rates were also influenced by eccentric exercise, but had recovered 24 hours later (Chapter 3). These findings indicate that eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage alters the correlated discharge behaviour and recruitment threshold of human motor units in elbow flexor muscles for ≤ 24 hrs. It was therefore hypothesised in Chapter 4 that a lasting adaptation in correlated motor unit activity and/or motor unit recruitment may contribute to the “repeated bout effect”, which results in reduced muscle damage from a subsequent bout of eccentric exercise. In Chapter 4, a repeated bout of eccentric exercise performed 7 days after the initial bout resulted in reduced symptoms of muscle damage, including a faster recovery of muscle strength, and reduced development of muscle soreness. Motor unit activity measured 7 days after the initial bout of exercise (immediately before the repeated bout) showed <b>elevated</b> <b>motor</b> unit synchronization, but a recovery of motor unit recruitment threshold to pre-exercise levels. These findings are the first to demonstrate a long-term neural adaptation following eccentric exercise, and suggest a potential role for motor unit synchronization in reducing muscle damage after a repeated bout of eccentric exercise.

Yet the role of the dACC in motor control is under-characterized. Here we aimed to characterize the dACC’s role in adolescent brain network interactions during a simple motor control task involving visually coordinated unimanual finger movements. Network interactions were assessed using both undirected and directed functional connectivity analysis of fMRI BOLD signals, comparing the task with a rest condition. The relation between the dACC and Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) was compared to that between the dACC and Primary Motor Cortex (M 1). The directed signal from dACC to SMA was significantly <b>elevated</b> during <b>motor</b> control in the task. By contrast, the directed signal from SMA to dACC, both directed signals between dACC and M 1, and the undirected functional connections of dACC with SMA and M 1, all did not differ between task and rest. Undirected coupling of dACC with both SMA and dACC, and only the dACC-to-SMA directed signal, were significantly greater for a proactive than a reactive task condition, suggesting that dACC plays a role in motor control by maintaining stimulus timing expectancy. Overall, these results suggest that the dACC selectively modulates the SMA during visually coordinated unimanual behavior in adolescence. The role of the dACC as an important brain area for the mediation of task-related motor control may be in place in adolescence, continuing into adulthood. The task and analytic approach described here should be extended to the study of healthy adults to examine network profiles of the dACC during basic motor behavior...|$|R
40|$|Continuous theta burst {{stimulation}} (cTBS) is a repetitive {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} protocol {{that can}} inhibit human motor cortex (M 1) excitability and impair movement for � 1 h. While offering valuable insights into brain function and potential therapeutic benefits, these neuroplastic effects are highly variable between individuals. The source of this variability, and the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying the inhibitory after-effects, are largely unknown. In this regard, oscillatory activity at beta frequency (15 – 35 Hz) {{is of particular interest}} as it is <b>elevated</b> in <b>motor</b> disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and modulated during the generation of movements. Here, we used a source-level magnetoencephalography approach to investigate the hypothesis that the presence of neuroplastic effects following cTBS is associated with concurrent changes in oscillatory M 1 beta activity. M 1 cortices were localized with a synthetic aperture magnetometry beamforming analysis of visually cued index finger movements. Virtual electrode analysis was used to reconstruct the spontaneous and movement-related oscillatory activity in bilateral M 1 cortices, before and from 10 to 45 min after cTBS. We demonstrate that 40 s of cTBS applied over left M 1 reduced corticospinal excitability in the right index finger of 8 / 16 participants. In these responder participants only, cTBS increased the power of the spontaneous beta oscillations in stimulated M 1 and delayed reaction times in the contralateral index finger. No further changes were observed in the latency or power of movement-related beta oscillations. These data provide insights into the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying cTBS-mediated impairment of motor function and demonstrate the association between spontaneous oscillatory beta activity in M 1 and the inhibition of motor function...|$|R
40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is a dreadful, devastating and incurable {{motor neuron}} disease. Aetiologically, it is a multigenic, multifactorial and multiorgan disease. Despite intense research, ALS pathology remains unexplained. Following extensive literature review, this paper posits a new integrative explanation. This framework proposes that ammonia neurotoxicity is a main player in ALS pathogenesis. According to this explanation, {{a combination of}} impaired ammonia removal— mainly because of impaired hepatic urea cycle dysfunction—and increased ammoniagenesis— mainly because of impaired glycolytic metabolism in fast twitch skeletal muscle—causes chronic hyperammonia in ALS. In the absence of neuroprotective calcium binding proteins (calbindin, calreticulin and parvalbumin), <b>elevated</b> ammonia—a neurotoxin—damages <b>motor</b> neurons. Ammonia-induced motor neuron damage occurs through multiple mechanisms such as macroautophagy-endolysosomal impairment, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, CDK 5 activation, oxidative/nitrosative stress, neuronal hyperexcitability and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, the regional pattern of calcium binding proteins’ loss, owing to either ER stress and/or impaired oxidative metabolism, determines clinical variability of ALS.

50|$|The type {{of growth}} factor {{signaling}} can effect {{whether or not}} NSCs differentiate into motor neurons or not. Priming a media with FGF2 lowers {{the activity of the}} PI3K/AKT pathway, which activates GSK3β. This increases expression of HB9. Directly inhibiting PI3K in NSCs leads to a population of cells that are purely HB9+ and differentiate at an <b>elevated</b> efficiency into <b>motor</b> neurons. Grafting these cells into different parts of rats generates motor neurons regardless of the transplanted cells' microenvironment. Following injury, neural stem cells enter a repair phase and express high levels of PI3K to enhance proliferation. This is better for survival of the neurons as a whole but is at the expense of generating motor neurons. Therefore, it can be difficult for injured motor neurons to recover their ability. It is the purpose of modern research to generate neural stem cells that can proliferate but still differentiate into motor neurons. Lowering the effect of the PI3K pathway and increasing the effect of GSK3β and HB9 in NSCs is a potential way of generating these cells.|$|R
40|$|Motor {{proteins}} that translocate on nucleic acids are {{key players in}} gene expression and maintenance. While the function of these proteins is diverse, they are driven by highly conserved core motor domains. In transcription-coupled DNA repair, motor activity serves to remove RNA polymerase stalled on damaged DNA, making the lesion accessible for repair. Structural and biochemical data on the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd suggest that this enzyme undergoes large conformational changes from a dormant state to an active state upon substrate binding. Mfd can be functionally dissected into an N-terminal part instrumental in recruiting DNA repair proteins (domains 1 – 3, MfdN), and a C-terminal part harboring motor activity (domains 4 – 7, MfdC). We show that isolated MfdC has <b>elevated</b> ATPase and <b>motor</b> activities compared to the full length protein. While MfdN has large effects on MfdC activity and thermostability in cis, these effects are not observed in trans. The structure of MfdN is independent of interactions with MfdC, implying that MfdN acts as a clamp that restrains motions of the motor domains in the dormant state. We conclude that releasing MfdN:MfdC interactions serves as a central molecular switch that upregulates Mfd functions during transcription-coupled DNA repair...|$|R

In contrast, we observed significantly reduced SDtc [beside reduced superexcitability, TE, and sub-excitability] indicating reduced membrane excitability. SDtc depends on passive membrane properties, {{as well as on}} voltage-dependent Na+ conductance [17, 18]. Possible explanations for reduced SDtc in motor axons could be structural changes, membrane hyperpolarization, or persistently decreased Na+ conductance [11, 17, 18]. Structural changes of the motor neurons are not likely, since nerve conduction velocity was normal and since {{it has been reported that}} biopsies of sensory nerves obtained from patients with CIP show no structural abnormalities [19]. Membrane hyperpolarization was not evident. We suggest that a decrease in persistent Na+ conductance accounts for the reduction of SDtc in CIP patients. This hypothesis is confirmed by modeling our excitability data for CIP patients. The twofold decrease of Na+ current in CIP patients is in line with a nerve excitability study of patients with puffer fish—TTX [Na+ channel blocker] intoxication [17]—where a decrease of Na+ currents by a factor of two accounted for reduced superexcitability, sub-excitability, and TE and increased SDtc.|$|R

Starting in 1996, states {{have responded to}} these concerns by adopting graduated driver licensing (GDL) policies to reduce traffic hazards for teenagers. Previous literature evaluating the impact of graduated driver licensing (GDL) policies has demonstrated their effectiveness on reducing teenage involved fatal crashes. However, much remains unanswered: Why do they work? How do they work? Will the initial effects erode? How might they be improved? The difficulty in answering questions {{have been due to}} the unavailability of good estimates of how many teenage drivers are on the roads at any given time, and how that varies with the GDL policies. To fill this gap, we assess whether these policies achieve favorable results by improving teenage driving behavior, or by influencing the amount of teenage driving. We estimate a structural model that separately identifies the amount of teenage driving and the riskiness of teenage driving relying on data from two-car crashes and the information contained in the relative numbers of crashes between two teenagers, two adults versus a teenager and an adult.

40|$|Objective: Fragile X {{premutation}} carriers (fXPCs) have {{an expansion}} of 55 - 200 CGG repeats in the FMR 1 gene. Male fXPCs {{are at risk for}} developing a neurodegenerative motor disorder (FXTAS) often accompanied by inhibitory control impairments, even in fXPCs without motor symptoms. Inhibitory control impairments might precede, and thus indicate <b>elevated</b> risk for <b>motor</b> impairment associated with FXTAS. We tested whether inhibitory impairments are observable in fXPCs by assessing oculomotor performance. Method: Participants were males aged 18 - 48 years asymptomatic for FXTAS. FXPCs (n = 21) and healthy age-matched controls (n = 22) performed four oculomotor tasks. In a Fixation task, participants fixated on a central cross and maintained gaze position when a peripheral stimulus appeared. In a Pursuit task, participants maintained gaze on a square moving at constant velocity. In a Prosaccade task, participants fixated on a central cross, then looked at a peripheral stimulus. An Antisaccade task was identical to the Prosaccade task, except participants looked in the direction opposite the stimulus. Inhibitory cost was the difference in saccade latency between the Antisaccade and Prosaccade tasks. Results: Relative to controls, fXPCs had longer saccade latency in the Antisaccade task. In fXPCs, inhibitory cost was positively associated with vermis area in lobules VI-VII. Conclusion: Antisaccades require inhibitory control to inhibit reflexive eye movements. We found that eye movements are sensitive to impaired inhibitory control in fXPCs asymptomatic for FXTAS. Thus, eye movements may be useful in assessing FXTAS risk or disease progression. © 2014 American Psychological Association...|$|R
40|$|Background: Monomelic amyotrophy (MMA) is {{a benign}} motor neuron disorder, which {{particularly}} affects {{young people and}} the etiology is still unknown. Gangliosides are located on the outer surface of motor neurons. Anti-GM 1 antibodies {{have been found to}} be <b>elevated</b> in multi-focal <b>motor</b> neuropathy with conduction block and other neurological diseases, which may have therapeutic implication. Aim: To evaluate IgM anti-GM 1 antibody titers in patients of monomelic amyotrophy. Setting and Design: prospective controlled study. Materials and Methods: Forty-six clinically and electrophysiologically diagnosed cases of MMA were assessed for IgM anti-GM 1 antibody titers by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method and compared with titers in healthy controls, cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP). Titer of 800 units was taken as upper limit of normal (Buhlmann Laboratories AG, Switzerland). Statistical Analysis Used: one-way ANOVA. Results: The mean age of 46 patients with MMA was 24. 5 (&#x 00 B 1; 7. 3) years, with male female ratio of 44 : 2. The mean age of 19 healthy controls was 24. 1 (&#x 00 B 1; 3) years with male: female ratio of 18 : 1. Five (26 &#x 0025;) individuals in the healthy control group, 22 (48 &#x 0025;) patients of MMA, four (30 &#x 0025;) of ALS and five (50 &#x 0025;) of AIDP had high titers of IgM anti-GM 1 antibody (P > 0. 05). Conclusions: Although larger number of patients with MMA had higher IgM anti-GM 1 antibody titers, the difference was not statistically significant from titers of healthy individuals, and of patients in the ALS and AIDP group...|$|R
2500|$|After a {{brief period}} of {{depression}} and drinking as part of an apparent mid-life crisis, the forty-five-year-old Hassam then committed himself to a healthier life style, including swimming. During this time he felt a spiritual and artistic rejuvenation and he painted some Neo-Classical subjects, including nudes in outdoor settings. His urban subjects began to diminish and he confessed that he was tiring of city life, as bustling subways, <b>elevated</b> trains, and <b>motor</b> buses supplanted the graciousness of the horse-drawn scenes which he so enjoyed capturing in earlier times. The architecture of the city changed as well. Stately mansions gave way to skyscrapers, which he admitted had their own artistic appeal: [...] "One must grant of course that if taken individually a skyscraper is not much of a marvel of art as a wildly formed architectural freak. It is when taken in groups with their zig zag outlines towering against the sky and melting tenderly into the distance that the skyscrapers are truly beautiful." [...] Hassam's urban paintings took on a higher perspective and humans shrank in size accordingly, as illustrated in Lower Manhattan (1907). He began to spend only his winters in New York and traveled the balance of the year, calling himself [...] "the Marco Polo of the painters." [...] In 1904 and 1908, he traveled to Oregon and was stimulated by new subjects and diverse views, frequently working out-of-doors with friend, lawyer and amateur painter Colonel C. E. S. Wood. He produced over 100 paintings, pastels, and watercolors of the High Desert, the rugged coast, the Cascades, scenes of Portland, and even nudes in idealized landscapes (a series of bathers comparable to those of Symbolist Pierre Puvis de Chavannes). As usual, he adapted his style and colors to the subject at hand and the mood of place, but always in the Impressionist vein.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Rating scale {{items in}} a 6 -week {{clinical}} trial of olanzapine versus placebo augmentation {{in patients with}} mixed bipolar disorder partially nonresponsive to ≥ 14 days of divalproex monotherapy were analyzed to characterize symptom patterns that could predict remission. At baseline, the two treatment groups were similar. Findings Factor analysis with Varimax rotation was performed post hoc on baseline items of the 21 -Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS- 21) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Backwards-elimination logistic regression ascertained factors predictive of protocol-defined endpoint remission (HDRS- 21 score ≤ 8 and YMRS score ≤ 12) with subsequent determination of optimally predictive factor score cutoffs. Factors for Psychomotor activity (YMRS items for <b>elevated</b> mood, increased <b>motor</b> activity, and increased speech and HDRS- 21 agitation item) and Guilt/Suicidality (HDRS- 21 items for guilt and suicidality) significantly predicted endpoint remission in the divalproex+olanzapine group. No factor predicted remission in the divalproex+placebo group. Patients in the divalproex+olanzapine group with high pre-augmentation psychomotor activity (scores ≥ 10) {{were more likely to}} remit compared to those with lower psychomotor activity (odds ratio [OR] = 3. 09, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 22 - 7. 79), and patients with marginally high Guilt/Suicidality (scores ≥ 2) were less likely to remit than those with lower scores (OR = 0. 37, 95 % CI = 0. 13 - 1. 03). Remission rates for divalproex+placebo vs. divalproex+olanzapine patients with high psychomotor activity scores were 22 % vs. 45 % (p = 0. 08) and 33 % vs. 48 % (p = 0. 29) for patients with low Guilt/Suicidality scores. Conclusions Patients who were partially nonresponsive to divalproex treatment with remaining high vs. low psychomotor activity levels or minimal vs. greater guilt/suicidality symptoms were more likely to remit with olanzapine augmentation.

40|$|Renshaw cells {{receive a}} high density of {{inhibitory}} synapses characterized by large postsynaptic gephyrin clusters and mixed glycinergic/ GABAergic inhibitory currents with large peak amplitudes and long decays. These properties appear adapted to increase inhibitory efficacy over Renshaw cells and mature postnatally by mechanisms that are unknown. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} heterosynaptic influences from excitatory motor axon inputs modulate the development of inhibitory synapses on Renshaw cells. Thus, tetanus (TeNT) and botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT-A) were injected intramuscularly at postnatal day 5 (P 5) to, respectively, <b>elevate</b> or reduce <b>motor</b> axon firing activity for 2 weeks. After TeNT injections, the average gephyrin cluster areas on Renshaw cells increased by 18. 4 % at P 15 and 28. 4 % at P 20 and decreased after BoNT-A injections by 17. 7 % at P 15 and 19. 9 % at P 20. The average size differences resulted from changes in the proportions of small and large gephyrin clusters. Whole-cell recordings in P 9 –P 15 Renshaw cells after P 5 TeNT injections showed increases in the peak amplitude of glycinergic miniature postsynaptic currents (mPSCs) and the fast component of mixed (glycinergic/GABAergic) mPSCs compared with controls (60. 9 % and 78. 9 %, respectively). GABAergic mPSCs increased in peak amplitude to a smaller extent (45. 8 %). However, because of the comparatively longer decays of synaptic GABAergic currents, total current transfer changes after TeNT were similar for synaptic glycine and GABAA receptors (56 vs 48. 9 % increases, respectively). We concluded that motor axon excitatory synaptic activity modulates the development of inhibitory synapse properties on Renshaw cells, influencing recruitment of postsynaptic gephyrin and glycine receptors and, to lesser extent, GABAA receptors...|$|R
