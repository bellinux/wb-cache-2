40|$|The {{production}} of sand particle has become serious problem to {{oil and gas}} well and was subject for study during the past years. Basically, sand production must be {{the results of a}} change in strength of the formation rock due to drilling, perforation and production operation and drag forces of the produced fluids. Therefore, during designing and developing stages, parameters related to sand production need to be examined carefully. This paper presents an experimental study of the effects of wellbore geometry and flow rate to sand production and total oil recovery; to minimize sand production as well as optimize production. The experimental works include of static and dynamic sand production tests, which were carried out on wellbore models with different wellbore angle, perforation shot density; and perforation pattern and flow rate using Servo Control Compression Testing Machine (SCCTM). The results show that oil production is reduced as sand production increases and most of produced sand are large size indicating the dominant effects of the breakage of cementing materials. Sand production increase significantly after effective stress reaches 35 - 60 % of rock compressive strength and followed by the reduction of total oil recovery to 55 - 73 %. In addition, sand production increases as wellbore angle, shot <b>density,</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> increase and as perforation pattern change from spiral to inplane and finally inline, especially for model with more than 10 o well bore angle, inline pattern and 1600 cc/h flow rate. Therefore, in order to optimize production, sand production must be minized by reducing wellbore angle (< 10 o); shot <b>density,</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> (< 1600 cc/h), perforated with spiral pattern and pore pressure should be controlled so that effective stress around a wellbore is not more than 35 % of rock compressive strength...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{investigation}} of mixing phenomena caused by the interaction between a uniform magnetic field and a magnetic fluid in a microfluidic chamber. The flow system consists of a water-based ferrofluid and a mixture of DI water and glycerol. Under a uniform magnetic field, the mismatch in magnetization of the fluids leads to instability at the interface and subsequent rapid mixing. The mismatch of magnetization is determined by concentration of magnetic nanoparticles. Full mixing at a relatively low magnetic flux density up to 10 mT can be achieved. The paper discusses the impact of key parameters such as magnetic flux <b>density,</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> ratio and viscosity ratio on the mixing efficiency. Two main mixing regimes are observed. In the improved diffusive mixing regime under low field strength, magnetic particles of the ferrofluid migrate into the diamagnetic fluid. In the bulk transport regime under high field strength, the fluid system is mixed rapidly by magnetically induced secondary flow in the chamber. The mixing concept potentially provides a wireless solution for a lab-on-a-chip system that is low-cost, robust, free of induced heat and independent of pH level or ion concentration. Full Tex...|$|E

We will present an analysis of detector data collected by more than 3000 loop detectors {{during the past three years}} on the motorway network of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Besides presenting some general aspects of traffic flow, our analysis focuses on the characteristics of so-called high-flow states, i. e. traffic states where the flow rate exceeds 50 vehicles per minute and lane (3000 veh/h/lane). We investigate the duration, frequency and other statistics of such states, the viability of the data and we study the conditions under which they occur. The factors that influence the existence of high-flow states in traffic are, for instance, the fraction of slow vehicles (namely trucks), the motorway's general topology (e. g. number of lanes), the hour of the day and day of the week. This information is directly accessible from the detector data. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures, presented at "Traffic and Granular Flow 2013 " conferenc...|$|E

The study focuses particularly on the fluid and substrate temperature distribution within the PCR chip and the droplet residence times in critical temperature zones.

The simulations demonstrate that the flow rate strongly affects the carrier-fluid's temperature field.

The second part of this study dealt with the effects of the operating conditions on the quality of extracts, and more precisely on their composition in vegetal oil and essential oil. It was observed that the supercritical extraction had no major effect on the fatty acid composition of the vegetal oil compared to classical extraction techniques, while essential oil is enriched in components such as linalool and that a previous drying of the seeds is deleterious.

The effects of current <b>density,</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> of air, electrolysis time, initial pH, and ferrous ion concentration were investigated for real textile wastewater.
