Acute toxicity tests, embryo-larval toxicity tests, and chronic toxicity tests that measure survival, growth, and reproductive effects now provide the most relative utility for evaluation of potential chemical hazards to aquatic life. Physiological, biochemical, and histological measurements have a low relative utility as diagnostc tests in aquatic toxicology because it is not yet possible to relate changes in these sublethal responses to adverse environmental impacts. The problem of interpreting the toxicological significance of dhemial-induced changes in biochemical and physiological mechanisms is twofold: (1) the understandingof physiological and biochemical regulatory mechanisms in fish is limited; and (2) paraliel changes in these meanisms are difficult to correlate with toxicant exposure and impaired ability of fish to survive.

40|$|Abstract: CD 43 is {{the major}} {{leukocyte}} sialoglyco-protein that plays important functional roles in neutrophils and lymphocytes. However, the expres-sion of CD 43 on human natural killer (NK) cells and its participation in the regulation of NK activity has not been studied. We have therefore investi-gated the expression of CD 43 isoforms on human NK cell subpopulations {{as well as the}} role of this molecule in NK cell activation and cytotoxicity. We found that CD 56 bright and CD 56 dim NK cells express different sialylated forms of CD 43, observing that activation of the CD 56 bright NK cells induces the change of tetrasaccharide O-glycans to hexasaccha-ride O-glycans on CD 43. Cross-linking of the mol-ecule with mAbs results in a metalloprotease-dependent loss of CD 43 from the NK cell surface, whereas soluble anti-CD 43 mAbs induce a vigorous NK cell proliferation. This property is distinct from T cells, which proliferate after CD 43 cross-linking only in the presence of monocytes. Occupancy of the CD 43 receptor on NK cells transduces specific signals, leading to enhanced killing activity and tyrosine phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of several substrates. We therefore propose that CD 43 significantly contributes to the regulation of the NK cell function by participating in the control of effector/target interactions and, <b>if</b> <b>pertinent,</b> by transducing activation signals.

40|$|A {{decision}} {{framework is}} introduced to assist municipal engineers and planners to optimise decisions regarding {{the renewal of}} large infrastructure assets, such as water transmission pipes, trunk sewers or other assets with high costs of failure, inspection and condition assessment. The proposed decision framework identifies a need for immediate intervention or alternatively, enables to optimise the scheduling of the next inspection and condition assessment. The deterioration of the asset is modelled as a semi-Markov process, thereby discretised into condition states. The waiting times in each state {{are assumed to be}} random variables with `known' probability distributions. <b>If</b> <b>pertinent</b> data are scarce (as is typical in most municipalities) these probability distributions can be initially derived based on expert opinion. These distributions will then be continually updated as observed deterioration data are collected over time. Monte-Carlo simulation is used to calculate the distributions of the cumulative waiting times. Conditional survival probabilities are used to compile agedependent transition probability matrices in the various states. The expected discounted total cost associated with an asset (including cost of intervention, inspection and failure) is computed as a function of time. The time to schedule the next inspection/condition assessment is when the total expected discounted cost is minimum. Immediate intervention should be planned if the time of minimum cost is less than a threshold period (2 to 3 years) away. A computer program was prepared for demonstration and proof of concept.

Decrease in consumption, improvements in water distribution systems to avoid losses and more efficient water treatment processes are some actions that can be implemented to attack this problem. Membrane technology and biological processes are used in wastewater treatment to achieve high water quality standards. Some other technologies, besides water treatment, attempt to obtain energy from organic wastes present in water. In this study, a proof-of-concept was accomplished demonstrating that a Microbial Electrolysis Cell can be fully integrated with a Membrane Bioreactor to achieve wastewater treatment and harvest energy. Conductive hollow fiber membranes made of nickel functioned as both filter material for treated water reclamation and as a cathode to catalyze hydrogen production reaction. The produced hydrogen was subsequently converted into methane by hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Organic removal was 98. 9 % irrespective of operation mode. Maximum volumetric hydrogen production rate was 0. 2 m 3 /m 3 d, while maximum current density achieved was 6. 1 A/m 2 (based on cathode surface area). Biofouling, an unavoidable phenomenon in traditional MBRs, can be minimized in this system through self-cleaning approach of hybrid membranes by hydrogen production. The increased rate of hydrogen evolution at high applied voltage (0. 9 V) reduces the membrane fouling.

However {{the situation for}} newer antidepressants and atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPs) is different to PPIs, statins and renin-angiotensin drugs with greater tailoring of therapy and no wish to switch products in stable patients. Authorities welcome generics though given high costs particularly of patented AAPs. Objective: Assess (a) changes in utilisation of venlafaxine versus other newer anti-depressants before and after availability of generics, (b) utilisation of generic versus originator venlafaxine, (c) price reductions of venlafaxine over time and influence on total expenditure, (d) utilisation of risperidone versus other AAPs, (e) suggest potential additional reforms that could be introduced <b>if</b> <b>pertinent.</b> Methodology: A quasi-experimental study design with a segmented time series and an observational study. Utilisation measured in defined daily doses (DDDs) and total expenditure per DDD and over time. Results: No appreciable changes in the utilization patterns of venlafaxine and risperidone after generics. The reduction in expenditure/ DDD for venlafaxine decreased overall expenditure on antidepressants by 5 % {{by the end of}} the study versus just before generics despite a 37 % increase in utilization. Expenditure will further decrease if there was reduced prescribing of duloxetine. Conclusion: Depression, schizophrenia and bipolar diseases are complex diseases. As a result, specific measures are needed to encourage prescribing of generic risperidone and venlafaxine when multiple choices are appropriate, and authorities cannot rely on a &# 180;Hawthorne&# 180; effect between classes to enhance use of generics first line. Measures may include prescribing restrictions for duloxetine. No specific measures planned for AAPs with more generics becoming available...|$|E

The present study was undertaken to determine whether this is achieved when T 3 is added to the continuous sc infusion of T 4. Thyroidectomized rats were infused with placebo or T 4 (0. 80 and 0. 90 μg/ 100 g BW · day), alone or in combination with T 3 (0. 10, 0. 15, or 0. 20 μg/ 100 g BW · day). Placebo- infused intact rats served as euthyroid controls. Plasma and 12 tissues were obtained after 12 days of infusion. Plasma TSH and plasma and tissue T 4 and T 3 were determined by RIA. Iodothyronine deiodinase activities were assayed using cerebral cortex, pituitary, brown adipose tissue, liver, and lung. Circulating and tissue T 4 levels were normal in all the groups infused with thyroid hormones. On the contrary, T 3 in plasma and most tissues and plasma TSH only reached normal levels when T 3 was added to the T 4 infusion. The combination of 0. 9 μg T 4 and 0. 15 μg T 3 / 100 g BW-day resulted in normal T 4 and T 3 concentrations in plasma and all tissues as well as normal circulating TSH and normal or near-normal 5 '-deiodinase activities. Combined replacement therapy with T 4 and T 3 (in proportions similar to those secreted by the normal rat thyroid) completely restored euthyroidism in thyroidectomized rats at much lower doses of T 4 than those needed to normalize T 3 in most tissues when T 4 alone was used. <b>If</b> <b>pertinent</b> to man, these results might well justify a change in the current therapy for hypothyroidism.

This process can be considered an alternative that avoids a remediation procedure against the metal presence in industrial wastes. This process was verified in a treatment pilot plant located in Le 6 n, M 6 xico handling 10 m 3 /day of three types of effluents. The effluent streams were separated to facilitate the elimination of pollutants from each one. The process was based on in situ treatment and recycle to reduce problems associated with transportation and confinement of contaminated sludges. Two types of treatment were carried out in the pilot plant: The physical/chemical and biological treatments. Thirty-five experiments were conducted and the studied variables were the pH, type of flocculent, and its dose. The statistical significance of chromium samples was 94. 7 % for its precipitation and 99. 7 % for recovery. The objectives established for this phase of the development were accomplished and the overall efficiencies were measured for each stage in the pilot plant. The results were: a) chromium precipitation 99. 5 % from wastewater stream, b) chromium recovery 99 % for recycling, and c) physical/chemical treatment to eliminate grease and fat at least 85 % and 65 to 70 % for the biological treatment.

40|$|Introduction: Odontogenic infections remain {{predominantly}} localised {{and heal}} without any consequences due to modern diagnostic and therapy. However {{under certain conditions}} dentogenic infections may spread {{and can lead to}} systemic diseases. Especially in immunocompromised patients, fulminant courses continue to be reported that require a complex multidisciplinary management to be controlled. Material and methods: A retrospective analysis was carried out comprising all patients at the Department of Craniomaxillofacial Surgery at the Campus Virchow Klinikum in Berlin who had to undergo inpatient surgical treatment between January 2004 and December 2011 as a consequence of an odontogenic infection. Those patients who required postsurgery intensive care underwent a subsequent more detailed analysis in view of their existing risk profile [4]. Results: During 8 years 814 patients with odontogenic infections were treated on an inpatient basis, corresponding to approximately 4 % of all 18981 patients in the observed period. Severe postoperative complications occurred in 14 patients (1, 7 %), requiring intensive care and even leading to the death of one patient (0, 1 %). All 14 patients suffering from complications showed typical risk factors, either singly or in combination with others, such as immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus, adipositas, or arterial hypertension, including their systemic consequences. Additionally, systemic alcohol and nicotine abuse and poor dental hygiene were found. On the basis of the existing data, it can be concluded that about two patients per week require inpatient surgical treatment and complications may be expected in two cases per year. Discussion: Despite modern diagnostics and therapy, about 2 % of the patients showed life-threatening complications requiring intensive care after surgical therapy of odontogenic infections. All 14 patients with severe conditions after odontogenic infections showed typical predisposing factors. Appropiate treatment of complicated courses following odontogenic infections is based on early diagnosis and a multidisciplinary therapy approach. <b>If</b> <b>pertinent</b> risk factors are present, the possibility of a fulminant infection of dentogenic origin should be taken into consideration to provide early interdisciplinary management. Conclusion: Severe conditions after surgical treatment of odontogenic infections were observed in almost 2 % of the patients who were treated on an inpatient basis. Predisposing comorbidity was present in each case. If typical risk factors exist, early multidisciplinary management must be ensured because severe complications continue to pose a challenge despite modern diagnostics and therapy...|$|E
40|$|With {{the final}} aim to develop novel {{additional}} tools {{for the evaluation}} of exposure to malaria vectors we started an analysis of the human humoral response to recombinant salivary proteins of the major African vector Anopheles gambiae. We started focusing our efforts on gSG 6 (gambiae Salivary Gland protein 6), a small protein specifically expressed in adult female glands where it plays some important role in blood feeding (Lanfrancotti A et al., 2002; Arcà B et al., 2005; Lombardo F et al., 2009). This protein seemed especially suitable because it is relatively abundant in the An. gambiae saliva, is restricted to anopheline species and earlier studies indicated its immunogenicity to humans (Orlandi-Pradines E et al., 2007; Poinsignon A et al., 2008). We optimized conditions for expression and purification of a recombinant version of gSG 6 and we used it to measure by ELISA the anti-gSG 6 IgG response in human sera collected during three consecutive years in a rural malaria hyperendemic area of Burkina Faso. The IgG response in the exposed population varied according to malaria transmission and was short-lived, as indicated by a drop in the IgG levels during the dry low transmission season. The response started very early, with a maximum in one-two years old children, and then decreased according to age; a similar pattern has been previously observed with whole mosquito saliva (Peng Z et al., 2004) and interpreted as possible desensitization to salivary antigens. Interestingly, the response was significantly different in Mossi and Fulani, two sympatric ethnic groups already shown to differentially respond to several Plasmodium falciparum antigens (Modiano D et al., 1996; Torcia MG et al., 2008). An. gambiae, Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus are the three main African malaria vectors and they all carry in their saliva the SG 6 protein. Since the An. arabiensis (aSG 6) and the An. funestus (fSG 6) homologues share 98 % and 80 % identities with gSG 6, it is likely (although verification is needed) that the antibody response to gSG 6 may be used to evaluate exposure to all three main African malaria vectors. In conclusion, our study provides strong support to the idea that anopheline-specific salivary antigens may represent a solid serological marker of exposure to malaria vectors and indicates that a reliable evaluation should also take into consideration the age and, <b>if</b> <b>pertinent,</b> the ethnic group of the populations analyzed. Moreover, comparative analysis of mosquito sialomes also highlights the existence of a relatively large group of culicine-specific salivary proteins suggesting their possible exploitation as indicators of exposure to Aedes and Culex vectors...|$|E
40|$|Lumbar disc {{herniation}} {{has a high}} {{prevalence and}} strong social-medical impact. Patients suffer from lower back pain that radiates from the spine. Loss of sensation or paresis adds to the clinical picture. The diagnosis should be confirmed by imaging in patients considered for surgery. High remission rates initially warrant conservative treatment (adequate analgesia and physiotherapy) in many patients. If this treatment {{does not lead to}} significant alleviation within 5 - 8 weeks, surgery should be performed {{to reduce the risk of}} chronic nerve affection. Posterior interlaminar fenestration is the intervention primarily conducted for this diagnosis.

40|$|The {{unidirectional}} flux of an ionic {{species may}} occur because of several mechanisms such as active transport, passive diffusion, exchange diffusion, etc. The contribution of such mechanisms {{to the total}} unidirectional flux across a membrane cannot be determined by only measuring that flux. It is shown that <b>if</b> the <b>pertinent</b> experimental data (the opposite unidirectional fluxes and the composite phenomenological resistance coefficient of the ionic species for a given electrochemical potential difference) obey a certain inequality, then the parameters of a model consisting of parallel, independent, active transport, and passive processes may be determined. Although the existence of “additional” processes including exchange diffusion, single-file pore diffusion, isotope interaction, etc. is not disproved, their existence is unnecessary if the inequality is satisfied. Two types of violations of the inequality may occur: (a) if the upper limit is disobeyed the presence of another substance contributing to the measured resistance and/or a constant affinity of the active transport process may be indicated; (b) if the lower limit is disobeyed {{it is necessary to}} postulate the existence of an additional process. For the latter type of violation, exchange diffusion is chosen as an example. Methods are given for determining the contribution of exchange diffusion, active transport, and passive diffusion to the unidirectional flux for some special cases...|$|R
