50|$|Tetzel {{was also}} {{condemned}} (though later pardoned) for immorality. When {{he discovered that}} Karl von Miltitz had accused him of perpetrating numerous frauds and <b>embezzlements,</b> he withdrew, broken in spirit, wrecked in health, into the Dominican monastery in Leipzig. Miltitz was later discredited {{to the point where}} his claims carry no historical weight.|$|R
50|$|The {{political}} situation when his reign began was agitated. He {{made it even}} worse by repeating the same mistake as his predecessors: he supported only one political party. <b>Embezzlements,</b> thefts, murders, revenge and political factionalism were common during his reign. The parties accused {{each other through the}} press. In order to make things a little better, he imposed censorship on the press.|$|R
5|$|On December 1, 2015, Menem {{was also}} found guilty of <b>embezzlement,</b> and sentenced four and half years to prison.

5|$|The {{current and}} past highway commissioners were accused of {{incompetence}} and <b>embezzlement</b> and forced to repay money. According to Suetonius, {{in the first year}} of Caligula's reign he squandered 2.7 billion sesterces that Tiberius had amassed. His nephew Nero Caesar both envied and admired the fact that Gaius had run through the vast wealth Tiberius had left him in so short a time.|$|E
5|$|While still {{residing}} in Lawton, Crawford's stepfather {{was accused of}} <b>embezzlement.</b> Although he was acquitted in court, he was blacklisted in Lawton, and {{the family moved to}} Kansas City, Missouri, around 1916.

On the other hand, Sandra (Fran Meric), Daniel (Alberto Casanova) and Andrés (Luis Ernesto Franco), Cecilia's brothers, begin to suspect that their uncle Raul is making <b>embezzlements.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In his {{crusade against}} what he diagnoses as the [...] "Belgian disease" [...] (in this sense the political-administrative tangle facilitating {{inefficiency}} and corruption), he joined several parliamentary commissions for the investigation of scandals and <b>embezzlements.</b> In that capacity, Annemans {{took part in the}} Dutroux commission (1996), the commission investigating the [...] "Brabant massacres" [...] (also 1996), the Dioxin affair commission (1999), the Sabena commission (2001) and the two commissions concerning the Fortis affair (2009).|$|R
5|$|A liberal, Anspach {{feared the}} {{weakness}} and rigidity {{of the government}} and therefore gave the work of covering the river to a private British company, the Belgian Public Works Company (the English name was used), which was created for the task. However, partway through construction, it was forced to relinquish control to the city of Brussels after an <b>embezzlement</b> scandal in which a company director allegedly attempted to steal 2.5 million francs from the company. Anspach only barely kept his office in 1869 by-elections.|$|E
5|$|After Mao Zedong's communists won the Chinese Civil War and {{established}} the People's Republic of China in 1949, Shangguan Yunzhu continued her acting career {{under the new}} government. In 1951 she married her third husband Cheng Shuyao (程述尧), manager of Shanghai's Lyceum Theatre. She {{gave birth to a}} son named Wei Ran (韦然). However, Cheng Shuyao was soon embroiled in the Five-anti Campaign, a political campaign launched by Mao against the capitalist class in 1952. He was accused of <b>embezzlement</b> and confessed to the charges under pressure. Shangguan decided to divorce Cheng; their marriage lasted less than two years. She later had another relationship with the director He Lu (贺路).|$|E
5|$|After Matthias's death, he was {{the only}} bishop to support the bid of Matthias's illegitimate son, John Corvinus, for the throne. After the united armies of Corvinus's {{supporters}} were defeated, he swore fealty to Vladislaus II Jagiellon. The new king made him royal treasurer in 1494, but he was dismissed after being accused of <b>embezzlement</b> at the Diet of Hungary in 1496. Pécs Cathedral and the castle at Pécs were renovated during his tenure. His three retainers strangled him to seize his wealth.|$|E
60|$|The {{rate for}} the {{highways}} is the most arbitrary and unequal tax in the kingdom: in some places two or three rates of sixpence per pound in the year; in others the whole parish cannot raise wherewith to defray the charge, either by the very bad condition of the road or distance of materials; in others the surveyors raise what they never expend; and the abuses, exactions, connivances, frauds, and <b>embezzlements</b> are innumerable.|$|R
50|$|Not {{only did}} Mair spend huge sums on his {{collections}} {{and on his}} projects, {{he also had a}} very expensive lifestyle, frequently hosting receptions for the more important burghers of Augsburg. His own income was not sufficient for this, and during many years, he misappropriated funds from the city treasury, with the supervision of which he had been entrusted since 1541. His <b>embezzlements</b> were discovered in 1579, and Mair was hanged as a thief at the age of 62.|$|R
60|$|Inclosed {{you have}} a {{translation}} of an arzee from the Killidar of Vellore. I have thousands of the same kind; but this, just now received, will serve {{to give you some}} idea of the miseries brought upon this my devoted country, and the wretched inhabitants that remain in it, by the oppressive hand of Lord Macartney's management: nor will the <b>embezzlements</b> of collections thus obtained, when brought before you in proof, appear less extraordinary,--which shall certainly be done in due time.|$|R
5|$|After {{a costly}} legal battle over {{a real estate}} deal with William S. King and the {{financial}} downturn of the Panic of 1893, Menage's real estate empire collapsed and he fled the country to avoid prosecution on charges of <b>embezzlement.</b> The charges against Menage were eventually dropped after several key witnesses had died or become hesitant to testify against him. He spent the later portion of his life working in real estate in the New York City area and never worked in Minnesota again.|$|E
5|$|Bokassa also {{hunted down}} Banza's close associates, such as Joseph Kallot, Faustin Marigot and Polycarpe Gbaguili. Kallot and Marigot died {{in prison in}} June 1969 and April 1971, respectively. With the {{exception}} of Gbaguili, who remained in prison until {{the downfall of the}} Bokassa regime on 20 September 1979, the other associates were released months after their arrest. Gbaguili served as a witness in Bokassa's criminal trials for treason, murder, cannibalism and <b>embezzlement</b> during the 1980s, explaining in detail the numerous crimes and human rights violations the former dictator had completed.|$|E
5|$|Cluj-Napoca and the {{surrounding}} area (Cluj County) had a rate of 268 criminal convictions per 100,000 inhabitants during 2006, just above the national average. After the revolution in 1989, the criminal conviction rate in the county entered a phase of sustained growth, reaching a historic high of 429 in 1998, when it began to fall. Although the overall crime rate is reassuringly low, petty crime can be an irritant for foreigners, as in other large cities of Romania. During the 1990s, two large financial institutions, Banca Dacia Felix and Caritas, went bankrupt due to large-scale fraud and <b>embezzlement.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1913, {{under the}} hotel's then owner Colonel Richard A von Falkenberg it was running under loss, {{and he was}} {{reported}} missing probably to avoid debtors. The Los Angeles Times reported that the hotel owner Falkenberg {{and his wife had}} disappeared due to [...] "a precarious financial position," [...] he explained it as case of nervousness and that he had gone to Ventura for a rest. Also reported from the hotel were several thefts and <b>embezzlements.</b> On 13 February 1913, Mary Jauch, then owner of the hotel, had jewelry stolen worth $8,300.|$|R
500|$|It {{was from}} the alliance's {{treasury}} that Pericles drew the funds necessary to enable his ambitious building plan, centered on the [...] "Periclean Acropolis", which included the Propylaea, the Parthenon and the golden statue of Athena, sculpted by Pericles' friend, Phidias. In 449 BC Pericles proposed a decree allowing the use of 9,000 talents to finance the major rebuilding program of Athenian temples. Angelos Vlachos, a Greek Academician, points out the utilization of the alliance's treasury, initiated and executed by Pericles, {{as one of the}} largest <b>embezzlements</b> in human history; this misappropriation financed, however, some of the most marvellous artistic creations of the ancient world.|$|R
50|$|Late in life Jones's {{grandfather}} had bought an estate at Lisselan, County Cork, adjoining the public road from Clonakilty to Bandon. He never visited it, {{and his son}} did so only once. In 1838, after <b>embezzlements</b> by the agent in charge, Jones took on its management, and lived there, almost entirely, from 1843 to 1880. Bringing knowledge of farming which he had gained in Suffolk, he made improvements on the estate, which consisted of about 4000 acres, and farmed 1000 acres himself. He engaged someobe to teach his tenants how to grow turnips and clover, he improved the roads, reclaimed more than 400 acres, and consolidated the farms. He was unpopular in the district, however.|$|R
5|$|Numerous {{proposals}} {{were made to}} remedy this problem, and in 1865, the mayor of Brussels, Jules Anspach, selected a design by architect Léon Suys to cover the river and build a series of grand boulevards and public buildings. The project faced fierce opposition and controversy, mostly due to its cost {{and the need for}} expropriation and demolition of working-class neighbourhoods. The construction was contracted to a British company, but control was returned to the government following an <b>embezzlement</b> scandal. This delayed the project, but it was still completed in 1871. Its completion allowed the construction of the modern buildings and boulevards which are central to downtown Brussels today.|$|E
5|$|On 24 October, {{it emerged}} that a Norwegian export credit company (Eksportfinans) {{had made a}} {{complaint}} to Norwegian police concerning the alleged <b>embezzlement</b> of 415 million Norwegian kroner (€47 million) by Glitnir since 2006. The Icelandic bank had acted as an agent for Eksportfinans, administering loans to several companies: however Eksportfinans alleges that, when the loans were paid off early by borrowers, Glitnir kept the cash and merely continued with the regular payments to Eksportfinans, effectively taking an unauthorized loan itself.|$|E
5|$|Regarding the {{taxability}} {{of income}} {{in connection with}} events or activities not involving a government privilege or franchise, the United States Supreme Court stated in United States v. Sullivan that gains from illegal traffic in liquor {{are subject to the}} Federal income tax. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Rutkin v. United States that the receipt of money obtained by extortion is taxable as income to the wrongdoer. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in James v. United States that the receipt of money obtained through <b>embezzlement</b> is taxable as income to the wrongdoer, even though the wrongdoer is required to return the money to its owner.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of the ministerial {{reshuffle}} in preparation for the coup of 18 Fructidor year V (4 September 1797), he was replaced by Georges-René Pléville De Pelley, but was instead made France's ambassador to Spain. He was removed from the political scene under the pretext of not having returned to France fast enough {{at the end of his}} duties, though in fact this removal was down to Talleyrand, the minister of the foreign affairs, in revenge for Truguet opposing Talleyrand's <b>embezzlements</b> in Spain. Exiled to Holland, he remained there nine months. On his return from Egypt, Napoléon Bonaparte offered him the navy ministry again, but Truguet refused this, and was instead named conseiller d'État on 20 September 1801.|$|R
50|$|Warne's {{arguments}} swayed Pinkerton, who employed Warne as {{the first}} female detective. Pinkerton soon {{had a chance to}} put Warne to the test. In 1858, Warne was involved in the case of Adams Express Company <b>embezzlements,</b> where she was successfully able to bring herself into the confidence of the wife of the prime suspect, Mr. Maroney. She thereby acquired valuable evidence leading to the husband's conviction. Mr. Maroney was an expressman living in Montgomery, Alabama. The Maroneys stole $50,000 from the Adams Express Company. With Warne’s help, $39,515 was returned. Mr. Maroney was convicted and sentenced to ten years in Montgomery, Alabama. In 1860, Allan Pinkerton, put Warne in charge of his new Female Detective Bureau.|$|R
50|$|When the {{undertaking}} finished in 1675 {{it was not}} renewed, but the Crown was now clear of all debts. Ranelagh ensured regular payments {{were made to the}} English Treasury, some of which paid for troops for Charles and some of which went to the renovation of Windsor Castle. This was largely achieved through short payment of the Irish army which was Ranelagh's training ground for his later <b>embezzlements</b> as Paymaster General to the English army. His skill, however, lay in his efficiency—for all his short payments the Irish army were in fact better paid than in the previous ill-managed regime. He ceased his involvement in Irish affairs in 1681 when the Irish treasury was handed over to a group of treasury commissioners.|$|R
5|$|The {{contract}} was signed on June 15, 1866 and the expropriation {{of the first}} 1,100 houses was completed in a few months. The work began on February 13, 1867. There were several technical difficulties that delayed the covering, {{many of which were}} due to the geology of Brussels, though they were not as bad as some engineers had forecast. The <b>embezzlement</b> scandal also caused a significant delay in construction, largely due to the change in control. The project was completed in 1871, with the municipal council ceremonially opening the reconstructed sluice gates on November 30.|$|E
5|$|The passion {{she showed}} for Abigail, and the {{stubborn}} refusal to dismiss her, angered Sarah {{to the point}} that she implied that a lesbian affair was taking place between the two women. During the mourning period for Anne's husband, Sarah {{was the only one who}} refused to wear suitable mourning clothes. This gave the impression that she did not consider Anne's grief over his death to be genuine. Eventually, because of the mass support for peace in the War of the Spanish Succession, Anne decided she no longer needed the Duke of Marlborough and took the opportunity to dismiss him on trumped-up charges of <b>embezzlement.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{process that}} {{ultimately}} led to Accum's departure from England and return to Germany began {{a few months after}} the publication of his book on the poisoning of foodstuffs. For a long time, many contradictory accounts have been given of the exact circumstances of his exile. Finally in 1951, Cole, in an addendum to the minutes of Royal Institution, proved that the presentation of the events adopted in the article in the Dictionary of National Biography, and also later in the Allgemeinen Deutschen Biographie (according to which Accum was embroiled in charges of <b>embezzlement</b> as librarian of the Royal Institution and escaped to Germany), did not correspond to the facts.|$|E

But Benedetto finds that his files have mysteriously disappeared. In an attempt to get revenge against Ender, he tries to leak what data he still has to the media, but Jane appears on his screen and gives him a choice: [...] "Either say nothing, or tell the whole truth."
