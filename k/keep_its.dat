5|$|A few {{deductions}} can be {{made from}} the satellite communications. The first is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19 MYT—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying burst frequency offset (BFO) values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it can also be deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they were}} not penalized, Nuggets coach George Karl and Knicks coach Isiah Thomas were both {{scrutinized}} for their part in the brawl. Carmelo Anthony was also criticized for harming his image as a star, and several writers said the league had penalized the players excessively because it wanted to <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> image free from violence.|$|E
5|$|Early {{drafts of}} Barret's {{background}} featured subtle differences, such as Marlene intended as Barret's biological daughter, {{and his wife}} executed {{in front of him}} by a then-undecided Shinra executive. The attack on Corel was initially written to be due to the discovery of Mako energy and Shinra's desire to <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> existence a secret. His reunion with Dyne was also different, written to culminate in a duel between the two in Corel's ruins, while Cloud and the others fought investigating Shinra soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Some experts {{also see}} the union {{as a way to}} curtail the loss of Russian {{influence}} in Central Asia. Russian politicians have voiced their concerns over Russia’s long southern borders and the challenges it may pose. By creating a regional trading bloc to <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> neighbours in Central Asia stable, Russia hopes to find securing its own borders easier.|$|E

5|$|Although the Xbox {{version of}} Halo lacks {{official}} support for online multiplayer play, third-party packet tunneling software provide unofficial ways around this limitation. The Windows and Macintosh ports of Halo support online matches involving up to 16 players and include multiplayer maps {{not in the}} original Xbox release. However, co-operative play {{was removed from the}} ports because it would have required large amounts of recoding to implement. In April 2014, it was announced that GameSpy's servers and matchmaking, on which Halo PC relied, would be shut down by May 31 of the same year. A team of fans and Bungie employees announced they would produce a patch for the game to <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> multiplayer servers online. The patch was released on May 16, 2014.|$|E
5|$|As of June 2017, Emirates has 48 orders {{outstanding}} {{but due to}} lack {{of space}} in Dubai Airport, it deferred 12 deliveries by one year and will not take any in 2019-20 before replacing its early airliners from 2021: there are open production slots in 2019 and Airbus reduced its production rate at 12 per year for 2017-18. The real backlog is much smaller than the official 107 with 47 uncertain orders: 20 commitments for the A380-specialized lessor Amedeo which commits to production only once aircraft are placed, eight for Qantas which wants to <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> fleet at 12, six for Virgin Atlantic which does not want them anymore and three ex Transaero for finance vehicle Air Accord.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the tree}} of heaven's weedy habit, landowners and other organisations often resort to various methods of control in order to <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> populations in check. For example, the city of Basel in Switzerland has an {{eradication}} program for the tree. It can {{be very difficult to}} eradicate, however. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical. A combination of several of these can be most effective, though they must of course be compatible. All have some positive and negative aspects, but the most effective regimen is generally a mixture of chemical and physical control. It involves the application of foliar or basal herbicides in order to kill existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to prevent new growth.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Aspmyra Næringseiendom {{converted}} its debt, then NOK20.5 million, to Swiss francs. Because of the transaction, {{within a}} year the company's debt had increased by 10 percent. In 2004, the stadium ownership company {{changed its name to}} Aspmyra Stadion AS. The municipality eliminated the stadium company's debt of NOK5.5 million to the municipality in November 2005. This allowed the club's operating company to have a positive share capital and the club was thus allowed to <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> license. In May 2006, the grass pitch was replaced with artificial pitch, costing NOK3.1 million. The training pitch received new turf in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Innovation Norway criticized Nordland County Municipality, who {{administrated}} the DA-funds, {{stating that}} both the grant and load to Glimt were illegal. Therefore, both were converted to an interest-bearing loan and were issued to Aspmyra Stadion instead of the club. The club is required to have positive equity to <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> license {{to play in the}} top two tiers. Because it was the majority shareholder of the stadium company, it filed consolidated accounts which also include the equity of Aspmyra Stadion AS. Thus, the consequence of Innovation Norway's proceedings was that the club risked ending up with a negative equity and could be relegated to the third tier. To secure it retained a positive equity, Glimt proposed selling the venue to the municipality.|$|E

Two days later, JAL officially announced that they would strengthen their partnership with American, including a joint application for antitrust immunity on transpacific routes. The airline would also fortify its relationship with other partners in the Oneworld alliance.|$|E
5|$|Since Sparta's {{army was}} now weakened, Nabis {{appealed to the}} Aetolians for help. They sent to Sparta 1,000 cavalry {{under the command of}} Alexamenus. The story goes that while Nabis was observing his army's drills, the Aetolian {{commander}} Alexamenus charged at him and killed him with his lance. Afterwards the Aetolian troops seized the palace and set about looting the city but the inhabitants of Sparta were able to rally and rout them out of town. As Sparta was in turmoil Philopoemen entered the city with the Achaean army and made Sparta a member state of the League. The polis of Sparta was allowed to <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> laws and territory, but the exiles, and their rule of the Spartan warrior demos were not restored.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{contend that}} a risk parity portfolio requires strong management and continuous oversight {{to reduce the}} potential for negative consequences {{as a result of}} leverage and allocation building in the form of buying and selling of assets to keep dollar holdings at predetermined and equalized risk levels. For example, if the price of a security goes up or down and risk levels remain the same, the risk parity portfolio will be adjusted to <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> dollar exposure constant. On the other hand, some consider risk parity to be a passive approach, because it does not require the portfolio manager to buy or sell securities on the basis of judgments about future market behavior.|$|E
5|$|The Tsugaru clan {{sided with}} Tokugawa Ieyasu's Eastern Army during the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Its {{immediate}} neighbors also all supported the Eastern Army. After the Tokugawa victory at Sekigahara, the Tsugaru clan was granted {{an increase in}} territory, along with permission to <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> existing domain of Hirosaki (named for the family's castle town). The domain started out small at 45,000 koku, before being increased in size to 100,000 koku. Tamenobu remained politically active {{in the early years}} of the Edo era, mainly in the Kansai area; he died in Kyoto in 1608.|$|E
5|$|The city {{reached its}} peak in the 12th century, with a {{population}} of approximately 200,000.

The remains of the city were eventually absorbed by nearby Cairo, which had been built to the north of Fustat in 969 when the Fatimids conquered the region and created a new city as a royal enclosure for the Caliph. The area fell into disrepair for hundreds of years and was used as a rubbish dump.|$|E
