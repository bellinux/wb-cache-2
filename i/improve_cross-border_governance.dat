40|$|The rise of {{cross-border}} {{relations is}} frequently {{linked to the}} decline of the nation state and the emergence of new forms of European governance. This article challenges some of the assumptions behind the policies stimulating regional cooperation along the national borders within the EU. It questions the assumption that regional <b>cross-border</b> <b>governance</b> is necessary for cross-border relations to develop. The article argues that the institutionalization of different territorial nation states with different social regulations not always hinders, but frequently stimulates cross-border relations. However, the territoriality of the EU planning practice of stimulating regional cross-border cooperation frequently hinders <b>cross-border</b> <b>governance.</b> The territorial administrative logic of cross-border cooperation and its governance drift away from the border, where cross-border behaviour is concentrated. The emergence of <b>cross-border</b> <b>governance</b> is further complicated while cross-border behaviour depends on national and international regulations outside the control of the midsized Euroregions. People living close to the border can sometimes profit from these differences. The fluid and fragmented groups of these border surfers are difficult to incorporate in the governance of territorial Euroregions. This article shows that unintended consequences of the EU planning practice of stimulating cross-border cooperation sometimes hinder the emergence of <b>cross-border</b> <b>governance...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractCross-border {{regions are}} multi-actor and {{multi-level}} spaces. Without any formal competencies they are exclusively based on cooperation between widely self-organized systems (regions). Thus, <b>cross-border</b> <b>governance</b> is facing multiple governance dilemmas. In this respect imperative environmental problems have often served as unifying element, putting diverging forces into the back. But {{just as often}} these issues fell from the agenda when the most important problems seemed to be solved - as they are too likely to cause severe conflicts between the partners.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is funded by}} the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF) Adaptation Research Grants Program (ARGP) 2011 - 2013. The focus is on what can be learnt from existing cross-border regulatory mechanisms {{with a view to}} strengthening and <b>improving</b> <b>cross-border</b> climate change adaptation practices in Australia. There is currently little understanding of the range of cross-border mechanisms and regulatory innovations, the efficacy of how they work, nor the key lessons that could be gleaned and adapted from existing initiatives for the purposes of climate change adaptation. The emphasis of this three-stage project therefore, is on identifying and collating the lessons learnt from existing Australian examples of regulatory reform models, authorities and mechanisms that have emerged to address cross-border issues at the national, state and local level. Using an institutional learning framework, the research offers key insights into the evolution, challenges and potentialities of cross- border governance for Australian-based climate change adaptation. The <b>cross-border</b> <b>governance</b> ‘problematique’ focuses primarily around two key agendas: [i] the novel re-articulations of power that cross-border innovations pose, involving diverse groups of actors and networks; and [ii] the benefits and dis-benefits of informal collaborative transboundary arrangements as compared to more formalised regulatory state mechanisms. To this end, conceptual and practical understandings of <b>cross-border</b> <b>governance</b> and regulation can be seen to converge in their focus on the political and institutional processes of re-territorialisation. This monograph focuses specifically on Stage 1 of the project. This has involved a detailed literature review and desktop analysis of four Australian cross-border cases that operate at different levels of scale and complexity including: the Murray Darling Basin Agreement; the Australian Alps Cooperative Management Agreement; the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales Regional Collaboration; and the Cross Border Sub-Plan 2010 between the Gold Coast City, Queensland, and Tweed Shire, New South Wales. Key findings from Stage 1 include an emphasis on (1) the arrangement, development or formation process which results in (2) the adoption of particular arrangement leading to (3) implementation outcomes and (4) ‘on the ground’ effects. Further to this was the need for cross-border arrangements to re-imagine what was once separate as whole through a re-configuration of geographic (place), administrative (space) and political (territory) fragmentation; that with respect to <b>cross-border</b> <b>governance</b> arrangements there is no ‘one-size fits all’; and the recognition of mutual inter-dependencies and cross-border economies of scale. The implications for climate change adaptation regulatory reform will be further expanded in Stages 2 and 3 of this nationally funded research project.

Although pro-open border organizations in this borderland support secondary foreign policy principles, they collectively need to adjust them, due to the increasing border securitization on the Canada–US border. In other words, the militarization of the border should not affect mutually beneficial cross-border interactions and relations. Using Neil Fligstein and Doug McAdam’s ‘field theory’, this paper analyses how the field of <b>cross-border</b> <b>governance</b> in the Pacific Northwest tends to evolve in a new geopolitical context after 9 / 11, in which free trade and cross-border flows are subjected to growing ‘primary foreign policy’ security imperatives.

40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} {{the role of}} the third sector and social economy in the emergence of <b>cross-border</b> network <b>governance</b> in the Basque border region. Cross-border relations have historically been initiated by movements within civil society, anticipating policy actors in this matter. A policy change occurred in the 1990 s, with the gradual Europeanization of a new policy framework which enabled institutional cross-border cooperation. The current engagement of social economy actors in this kind of cooperation is marked by this double heritage, with contrasting forms of implementations. Initiatives motivated by Basque identity, despite being constructed historically as alternatives, are today spearheading <b>cross-border</b> network <b>governance.</b> In contrast, institutional asymmetries might hinder the emergence of <b>cross-border</b> network <b>governance</b> within sectors (here: social integration through economic activity) with no particular reference to a shared identity...|$|R

The aim {{of this article is to}} address this lack by developing a multidimensional perspective, in order to finally circumvent state-centric thinking on cross-border regions and to offer a more nuanced account of whether and how new imaginaries of spatial governance institutionalize.

40|$|Inner Scandinavia {{is one of}} the Swedish-Norwegian INTERRE G-A three sub-programmes, and {{has been}} working in operationalizing {{cross-border}} projects in the border area since 1994. To date, several cross-border strategies have been implemented, one for each programming period of the INTERRE G-A programme. This article investigates whether these strategies can be regarded as a type of cross-border planning mechanism in promoting territorial development of the border region. It does so by developing a typology, which captures the essentials of spatial planning, against the background of which the article also analyses Inner Scandinavia governance structures, which involves a whole set of interconnected territorial partnerships between five border counties: Hedmark, Østfold, Akershus (Norway), Värmland and Dalarna (Sweden). Here, the main goal is to see if the Inner Scandinavia governance structure, which was recently altered by the inclusion of the Hedmark–Dalarna cross-border committee, also known as TRU ST, is favourable to the implementation of a genuine and long-term cross-border spatial plan, with the ultimate goal of reducing the barrier effect and improving the territorial capital along the cross-border region. Project dokuments and interviews indicate that the existing <b>cross-border</b> <b>governance</b> model in Inner Scandinavia, led by the INTERRE G-A Steering Committee, produced substantial progresses in reducing the barrier effect, in all its dimensions, and in supporting the territorial development across the border area. Consequently, the role of other <b>cross-border</b> <b>governance</b> structures should be confined to promoting the active involvement and mobilization of local and regional actors in the cross-border cooperation process, and in implementing several cross-border projects with local/regional significance. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

Results indicate that non-Anglo-Saxon firms have developed their governance practices towards promoting an independent mechanism of control, namely a mechanism that is more similar to an Anglo-Saxon governance regime. In regard to governance-related disclosure practices, results indicate that for both Anglo-Saxon and non-Anglo-Saxon groups, disclosure practices have been evolving and converging towards more disclosures regarding governance matters...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} distinctive obstacles {{to the establishment}} of tourism destination governance in both transnational and within-country borderlands. Analysis of the German–Czech borderlands, a region also incorporating within-country borders between three German federal states, indicates the multi-scalar and political contestations of cross-border tourism collaboration. Local tourism projects are generally successful, both on a transnational German-Czech level and between the German states of Bavaria, Saxony and Thuringia. However, structural cross-border destination management does not exist because of (transnational) multi-scalar institutional alignment problems and (internal) tourism-specific destination-level power contestations. Understanding destination management processes in borderlands, therefore, requires: (i) explicit multi-scalar analysis; (ii) recognition of both transnational and within-country contexts; (iii) more cross-pollination between tourism planning and <b>cross-border</b> <b>governance</b> research. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse one of the {{inherent}} characteristics of cross-border cooperation: multi-level asymmetries. One of the main difficulties in developing cooperation is to find one's counterpart on both sides of the border. Being from different states, and thus different administrative and legal systems and cultures, the institutions involved in the cooperation work at different scales and are de facto mismatched. Two types of asymmetry are analysed: institutional and territorial. The harmonisation of regulations at European level, the conclusion of interstate agreements or sectoral regulations at regional level all put these findings into perspective. In addition, informal cooperation is essential for the stakeholders. Finally, the European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation (EGTC) could be a useful tool to reduce or minimise the impact of this asymmetries depending on the powers conferred to it. The use of these various tools may point towards the gradual institutionnalisation of a multi-level <b>cross-border</b> <b>governance</b> in some transfrontier areas...|$|R
