5|$|Current eagle feather law {{stipulates}} that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry {{enrolled in a}} federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain or possess bald or <b>golden</b> <b>eagle</b> feathers for religious or spiritual use. The constitutionality of these laws has been questioned by Native American groups {{on the basis that}} it violates the First Amendment by affecting ability to practice their religion freely.|$|E
50|$|Collins was {{succeeded by}} his former {{defensive}} coordinator Jim Carmody, who coached the <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagles</b> for six seasons. Under Carmody's tutelage, Carmody's <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagles</b> compiled {{a record of}} 37-29. Only one of those six seasons did the <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagles</b> finish with a losing record, a 4-7 campaign in 1984.

5000|$|Allegheny Front Hawk Watch in Cairnbrook, Pennsylvania, holds several {{records for}} <b>golden</b> <b>eagles</b> for the Eastern Flyway, including: the one-day record of 74 <b>golden</b> <b>eagles</b> counted on October 24, 2015 (Allegheny Front Hawk Watch held the {{previous}} record with 65 <b>golden</b> <b>eagles</b> set in 2012); the fall seasonal record of 320 golden eagles; and the total year count of 386 <b>golden</b> <b>eagles.</b> The Allegneny Front Hawk Watch is the highest hawkwatch in Pennsylvania.|$|R
5|$|In {{the modern}} era avian life {{includes}} the corncrake, red-throated diver, rock dove, kittiwake, tystie, Atlantic puffin, goldeneye, <b>golden</b> <b>eagle</b> and white-tailed sea eagle. The last named was re-introduced to RÃ¹m in 1975 and has successfully spread to various neighbouring islands, including Mull. There is a small population of red-billed chough concentrated on the islands of Islay and Colonsay.|$|E
5|$|Many {{populations of}} moorland birds, {{including}} {{the black and}} red grouse live here, and the country has internationally significant nesting grounds for seabirds such as the northern gannet. The <b>golden</b> <b>eagle</b> has become a national icon, and white-tailed eagles and ospreys have recently re-colonised the land. The Scottish crossbill is the only endemic vertebrate species in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Over 200 {{species of}} bird have been {{recorded}} in the area including black guillemot, eider, peregrine falcon and the <b>golden</b> <b>eagle.</b> In 1981 there were 28 ptarmigan on Arran, but in 2009 {{it was reported that}} extensive surveys had been unable to record any. Similarly, the red-billed chough no longer breeds on the island.|$|E
5000|$|The 1990 Southern Miss <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagles</b> {{football}} team represented the University of Southern Mississippi in the 1990 NCAA college football season. Led by Brett Favre, the <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagles</b> {{qualified for the}} [...] The <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagles</b> {{had one of the}} biggest upsets of the college football season when they beat the Alabama Crimson Tide by a score of 27-24.

50|$|In Watson's junior season, {{he carried}} the <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagles</b> with 9 points, 5 assists, and 2 steals per game. The <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagles</b> lost the Conference USA {{championship}} to the Memphis Tigers in double overtime. Watson led the <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagles</b> to the NIT quarterfinal, which they lost to the BYU Cougars. Watson had his best season in his senior year and led the <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagles,</b> averaging 11 points, 5 assists, and 2 steals per game. He was also fourth {{in the nation in}} free-throw percentage with 92%. The <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagles</b> made another NIT tournament but lost to the Minnesota Golden Gophers in the quarterfinals. After the loss, Watson was named a starter in the Reese's NCAA Basketball All-Star game.|$|R
50|$|The Southern Miss <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagles</b> {{football}} statistical {{leaders are}} individual statistical {{leaders of the}} Southern Miss <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagles</b> football program in various categories, including passing, rushing, receiving, total offense, defensive stats, and kicking.

5|$|Scotland's {{wildlife}} {{is typical}} of the north-west of Europe, although several of the larger mammals such as the lynx, brown bear, wolf, elk and walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times. There are important populations of seals and internationally significant nesting grounds for a variety of seabirds such as gannets. The <b>golden</b> <b>eagle</b> is something of a national icon.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{protected}} in the U.S. and Canada by the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty, later extended {{to all of}} North America. The Bald and <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagle</b> Protection Act, approved by the U.S. Congress in 1940, protected the bald eagle and the <b>golden</b> <b>eagle,</b> prohibiting commercial trapping and killing of the birds. The bald eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators. Perhaps most significant in the species' recovery, in 1972, DDT was banned from usage in the United States {{due to the fact}} that it inhibited the reproduction of many birds. DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989, though its use had been highly restricted since the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania IBA #33is on the Allegheny Front, {{which is}} along a prime migratory path {{for a variety}} of birds of prey. The <b>golden</b> <b>eagle,</b> bald eagle, osprey, and {{northern}} harrier pass through the area during their annual migration periods. It is possible that the bald eagle may nest within the IBA, but this has not been confirmed. Raptors which do nest in the forests of the IBA include the northern goshawk, red-shouldered, broad-winged, red-tailed, sharp-shinned, and Cooper's hawks.|$|E
5000|$|Carmody {{was hired}} to replace Bobby Collins as the <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagles</b> head {{football}} coach in 1982. Under his tutelage, the <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagles</b> compiled a record of 37-29.|$|R

5|$|Predators of the choughs {{include the}} {{peregrine}} falcon, <b>golden</b> <b>eagle</b> and Eurasian eagle-owl, while the common raven will take nestlings. In northern Spain, red-billed choughs preferentially nest near lesser kestrel colonies; the falcon, which eats only insects, provides {{a degree of}} protection against larger predators, and the chough benefits {{in terms of a}} higher breeding success. The red-billed chough is occasionally parasitised by the great spotted cuckoo, a brood parasite for which the Eurasian magpie is the primary host.|$|E
5|$|Queen Elizabeth II {{has long}} been {{associated}} with corgis. After a visit to Thomas Thynne, 5th Marquess of Bath in 1933, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret made it well known to their family that they liked the Corgis owned by the Marquess. Their father, Prince Albert, Duke of York (later George VI), purchased the Pembroke Corgi Rozavel <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagle,</b> from the Rozavel kennels in Surrey. It was renamed Dookie.|$|E
5|$|SS Mauna Loa was a steam-powered {{cargo ship}} of Matson Navigation Company that was sunk {{in the bombing}} of Darwin in February 1942. She was christened SS West Conob in 1919 and renamed SS <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagle</b> in 1928. At {{the time of her}} {{completion}} in 1919, the ship was inspected by the United States Navy for possible use as USS West Conob (ID-4033) but was neither taken into the Navy nor ever commissioned.|$|E

40|$|<b>Golden</b> <b>eagles</b> are {{distributed}} {{throughout much of}} the northern hemisphere (Kochert et al. 2002). In Washington, <b>golden</b> <b>eagles</b> nest {{throughout much of the}} state, but are most common in the north-central highlands transitional area between montane and shrub-steppe habitats (see Figure 1). Scattered nest sites are found in more arid portions of eastern Washington and west of the Cascades where the species is uncommon (Larrison and Sonnenberg 1968). The migratory status of nesting <b>golden</b> <b>eagles</b> in Washington has not been studied; observations of <b>golden</b> <b>eagles</b> along the upper Columbia River suggest they remain at nest sites throughout the winter (Knight et al. 1979) ...|$|R
50|$|On November 15, 2008, the Yankees sold Rasner to the Tohoku Rakuten <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagles</b> for $1 million. Rasner {{signed a}} two-year {{deal with the}} <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagles.</b> He played with the <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagles</b> for 5 years (2008 - 2013), the last three as a closer and setup man. He won the Japanese series {{championship}} {{as a member of}} the Rakuten <b>Golden</b> <b>Eagles</b> with former Yankees Andruw Jones, Casey McGehee and future Yankee Masahiro Tanaka who would sign with the New York Yankees in the 2013 offseason. After finishing his playing career he would become an international scout for the Eagles.|$|R
5|$|The {{bald eagle}} is the {{national}} bird of the United States of America. The founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the Roman Republic, in which eagle imagery (usually involving the <b>golden</b> <b>eagle)</b> was prominent. On June 20, 1782, the Continental Congress adopted the design for the Great Seal of the United States depicting a bald eagle grasping 13 arrows and an olive branch with its talons.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is hunted by {{birds of prey}} {{including}} the boreal owl, short-eared owl, tawny owl, Ural owl, Eurasian eagle-owl, <b>golden</b> <b>eagle,</b> kestrel, common buzzard, red kite, northern goshawk, peregrine falcon, and sparrowhawk. The eggs and chicks may be targeted by cats and corvids, although the adults are fearless in defence of their nests, occasionally even attacking humans. The mistle thrush is not normally a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough's predators {{include the}} {{peregrine}} falcon, <b>golden</b> <b>eagle</b> and Eurasian eagle-owl, while the common raven will take nestlings. In northern Spain, red-billed choughs preferentially nest near lesser kestrel colonies. This small insectivorous falcon is better at detecting a predator and more vigorous in defence than its corvid neighbours. The breeding {{success of the}} red-billed chough {{in the vicinity of}} the kestrels was found to be much higher than that of birds elsewhere, with a lower percentage of nest failures (16% near the falcon, 65% elsewhere).|$|E

25|$|In the wintertime, between November and February, bald <b>eagles</b> and <b>golden</b> <b>eagles</b> are present. These {{birds are}} less easily seen than many raptors; <b>golden</b> <b>eagles,</b> particularly, fly at high elevations. Mount Diablo {{is part of}} the Altamont Area/Diablo Range, which enjoys the largest {{concentration}} of <b>golden</b> <b>eagles</b> anywhere. In recent years there have been credible sightings of California condors, which have been reintroduced at Pinnacles National Park, located to the south in the Gilroy-Hollister area.|$|R
5|$|There are no snakes in Ireland {{and only}} one species of reptile (the common lizard) is native to the island. Extinct species include the Irish elk, the great auk and the wolf. Some {{previously}} extinct birds, such as the <b>golden</b> <b>eagle,</b> been reintroduced in about the year 2000 after decades of extirpation. Until medieval times Ireland was heavily forested with oak, pine and birch. Forests today cover about 12.6% of Ireland, of which 4,450kmÂ² or one million acres is owned by Coillte, the Republic's forestry service.|$|E
5|$|Effects {{are not all}} negative; for example, {{wind farms}} produce {{renewable}} energy, helping to mitigate the single greatest threat to birds, climate change. But, especially if wind farms are poorly sited, they may affect bird populations through disturbance, direct or indirect habitat loss, and collisions. Well sited wind farms benefit birds; poorly sited ones can kill many birds in collisions. For example, at the Altamont Pass in California, the <b>golden</b> <b>eagle</b> has been reduced by 80%, and nesting has ceased in the area. Thus, there is a trade-off in the siting of any wind farm.|$|E
5|$|Its wild creatures include black bear, bobcat, Mexican wolves, elk, Gila monsters, coyotes, rattlesnakes, cougars, skunks, and red foxes, {{as well as}} cranes, <b>golden</b> <b>eagle,</b> red-tailed hawk, {{and great}} horned owls. In keeping with Navajo tradition, none of the zoo's birds were {{captured}} {{for the purpose of}} being exhibited, but were rather rescued after sustaining injuries from vehicles or electrical lines and are thus unable to fly; the majority of the other specimens are also non-releasable and unable to survive in the wild due to being orphaned or having been confiscated as illegal pets from their former owners.|$|E
