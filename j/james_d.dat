5|$|Advances in {{understanding}} genes and inheritance continued throughout the 20th century. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) {{was shown to}} be the molecular repository of genetic information by experiments in the 1940s to 1950s. The structure of DNA was studied by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins using X-ray crystallography, which led <b>James</b> <b>D.</b> Watson and Francis Crick to publish {{a model of the}} double-stranded DNA molecule whose paired nucleotide bases indicated a compelling hypothesis for the mechanism of genetic replication.|$|E

5|$|In March 1862, a {{contract}} was placed with Laird & Son Co. by Captain <b>James</b> <b>D.</b> Bulloch, a naval {{agent for the}} Confederate States of America, for two double-turreted warships designed for ramming attacks {{at a cost of}} £93,750 each, exclusive of armament and ammunition.

5|$|In mid-July, Colonel Dodge {{learned from}} métis trader Pierre Paquette that the British Band was camped near the Rock River rapids, at present Hustisford, Wisconsin. Dodge and <b>James</b> <b>D.</b> Henry {{set out in}} pursuit from Fort Winnebago on July 15. The British Band, reduced to fewer than 600 people due to death and desertion, headed for the Mississippi River as the militia approached. The Americans pursued them, killing and {{scalping}} several Native stragglers along the way.|$|E
5|$|It was a {{long time}} after the Brooks–Baxter War that people of Arkansas allowed another Republican to become governor. The {{following}} 35 governors of Arkansas, ruling for a total of 90 years, were all Democrats, until Republican Winthrop Rockefeller became governor in 1966 defeating <b>James</b> <b>D.</b> Johnson. Winthrop became governor while his brother Nelson was governor of New York, while the defeat of Johnson in Arkansas and William M. Rainach in Louisiana ended the once mighty hold of segregation over politics.|$|E
5|$|Morrow {{served as}} a {{delegate}} to the Republican National Convention in 1916, 1920, and 1928. In 1919, he was chosen by acclamation as his party's candidate for governor. This time, his opponent was <b>James</b> <b>D.</b> Black. Black was Stanley's lieutenant governor and had ascended to the governorship in May 1919 when Stanley resigned to take {{a seat in the}} U.S. Senate.|$|E

5|$|Territorial Governor William Henry Harrison was {{appointed}} to office at age twenty-seven, making him the youngest executive. James B. Ray, elevated at thirty-one and reelected at thirty-two, was the youngest governor to be elected to office. Evan Bayh, at age thirty-four, is the only other governor {{under the age of}} forty to be elected. <b>James</b> <b>D.</b> Williams, at age sixty-nine, was oldest governor to be elected and died in office at age seventy-two.

5|$|The Human Genome Project—the largest, {{most costly}} single {{biological}} study ever undertaken—began in 1988 {{under the leadership}} of <b>James</b> <b>D.</b> Watson, after preliminary work with genetically simpler model organisms such as E. coli, S. cerevisiae and C. elegans. Shotgun sequencing and gene discovery methods pioneered by Craig Venter—and fueled by the financial promise of gene patents with Celera Genomics— led to a public–private sequencing competition that ended in compromise with the first draft of the human DNA sequence announced in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} of Governor <b>James</b> <b>D.</b> Williams proposed {{the construction of}} the fourth state capitol building in 1878. The third state capitol building was razed and the new one was constructed on the same site. Two million dollars was appropriated for construction and the new building was completed in 1888.

5|$|A made-for-television movie, Farewell to Manzanar, {{directed}} by John Korty, aired on March 11, 1976, on NBC. It {{was based on}} the 1973 memoir of the same name, written by Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston, who was incarcerated at Manzanar as a child, and her husband <b>James</b> <b>D.</b> Houston. The book and the movie {{tell the story of the}} Wakatsuki family and their experiences behind the barbed wire through young Jeanne's eyes. On October 7, 2011, the Japanese American National Museum (JANM) announced that they had negotiated the rights to the movie, and that they would make it available for purchase on DVD.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the 45th Division {{fought in}} 511 days of combat. Nine {{soldiers}} were awarded the Medal of Honor during their service with the 45th Infantry Division: Van T. Barfoot, Ernest Childers, Almond E. Fisher, William J. Johnston, Salvador J. Lara, Jack C. Montgomery, <b>James</b> <b>D.</b> Slaton, Jack Treadwell, and Edward G. Wilkin. Soldiers {{of the division}} also received 61 Distinguished Service Crosses, three Distinguished Service Medals, 1,848 Silver Star Medals, 38 Legion of Merit medals, 59 Soldier's Medals, 5,744 Bronze Star Medals, and 52 Air Medals. The division received seven distinguished unit citations and eight campaign streamers during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, when {{a scandal}} forced the {{original}} Republican nominee, Godlove Stein Orth, {{to drop out}} of the gubernatorial race, Harrison accepted the Republican Party's invitation to take his place on the ticket. Harrison centered his campaign on economic policy and favored deflating the national currency. He was ultimately defeated in a plurality by <b>James</b> <b>D.</b> Williams, losing by 5,084 votes out of a total 434,457 cast, but Harrison was able to build on his new prominence in state politics. When the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 reached Indianapolis, he gathered a citizen militia to make a show of support for owners and management, and helped to mediate an agreement between the workers and management and to prevent the strike from widening.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Sexual Preference {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} the psychologist Clarence Tripp in the Journal of Sex Research and the sociologist Ira Reiss in Contemporary Sociology, mixed reviews from the sociologist John DeLamater in Science and the sex researcher <b>James</b> <b>D.</b> Weinrich in The Quarterly Review of Biology, {{and a positive}} review from J. Kenneth Davidson, Sr. in the Journal of Marriage and Family. Criticisms made of the work included that its authors' conclusions were based on an unrepresentative or dubiously representative sample of homosexuals, and that their reliance on path analysis and adult recall of early childhood feeling was problematic.|$|E
5|$|The {{backward}} {{condition of}} shipyards in the seceding states convinced Mallory {{that he would}} have to look abroad to obtain the vessels that he thought would be able to challenge the U.S. Navy. He selected two men as his primary representatives: <b>James</b> <b>D.</b> Bulloch and Lieutenant James H. North of the Confederate States Navy. North was a disappointment, but Bulloch proved to be one of the most effective agents for the Confederacy in Europe. He sought diligently and discreetly in England to acquire ships for the purposes of his government while working within or around the framework of the neutrality laws of the host nation.|$|E
5|$|Youtsey, who {{received}} a life sentence, did not appeal, but after two years in prison, he turned state's evidence. In Howard's second trial, Youtsey claimed that ex-governor Taylor had discussed an assassination plot with Youtsey and Howard. He backed the prosecution's claims that Taylor and Powers worked out the details, he acted as an intermediary, and Howard fired the shot. On cross examination, the defense pointed out contradictions {{in the details of}} Youtsey's story, but Howard was still convicted. Youtsey was paroled in 1916 and was pardoned in 1919 by Democratic governor <b>James</b> <b>D.</b> Black.|$|E
