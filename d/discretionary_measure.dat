2500|$|The {{establishment}} of a duty of care is usually broken up into a three-step test. The first case to establish a general duty of care was Donoghue v Stevenson. Famously, Mrs Donoghue claimed compensation for illness, after she consumed a ginger beer containing a decomposed snail, in a public house in Paisley, Scotland. The bottle was opaque so Mrs Donoghue, nor the shopkeeper, could see a snail, {{and at the time}} she could not sue the shopkeeper for breach of contract or consumer rights. The House of Lords, by a majority held that the manufacturer, Mr Stevenson, was liable in tort. Lord Atkin held liability was [...] "based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay" [...] and people [...] "must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour." [...] By contrast, Lord Macmillan suggested that the law should protect Mrs Donoghue by incremental analogy to previous cases. Nevertheless, Lord Atkin's speech was widely followed, and understood to contain three main points for establishing a duty of care. Firstly, the concept of reasonable foreseeability of harm; secondly, the claimant and the defendant being in a relationship of proximity; and thirdly, and more loosely, it being fair, just and reasonable to impose liability on the defendant for his careless actions. This three step scheme (also known as the tripartite or threefold test) [...] however, did not crystallise until the case of Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman. A company called Caparo took over another company, by buying up a majority of its shares. It did this because it sneakily obtained word from a company audit that the target was financially sound. The audit was prepared by a group of accountants (Dickman) and was intended for shareholders, not outsiders. Once Caparo owned the company it found that the finances were in fact pretty shoddy, and so it sued the accountants for being negligent in its audit preparation. The House of Lords found against Caparo, and established the current threefold test. Although it was [...] "reasonably foreseeable" [...] that outsiders might learn of the carelessly prepared information, it was not the case that Caparo and Dickman were in a relationship of [...] "proximity". This the court used as a term of art (note, this is different from the American use of the word), to say that it should not be the case that absolutely anyone hearing something said that was stupid and acted on it can sue. The court was reacting to its concern that to allow a claim here might open the floodgates of litigation. The third element, whether liability would be [...] "fair, just and reasonable" [...] was an extra hurdle added, as a catch all <b>discretionary</b> <b>measure</b> for the judiciary to block further claims.|$|E

40|$|Summary for non-specialistsThis paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} governments' <b>discretionary</b> <b>measures</b> on tax revenues and tax elasticity in the European Union during {{the run-up to the}} 2008 / 2009 global financial crisis which was characterised by large swings in tax revenues. Using data collected {{in the context of the}} Output Gap Working Group of the Economic Policy Committee we show that while <b>discretionary</b> <b>measures</b> have had a limited impact on tax yields, they have in some cases significantly affected tax elasticities and thereby altered the relationship between tax revenues and the business cycle which plays a key role in the EU fiscal surveillance framework. Furthermore we provide evidence on the pro-cyclical nature of <b>discretionary</b> <b>measures</b> affecting tax revenues whereby governments tend to implement tax cuts during expansionary phases while resorting to tax increases during slowdowns. More generally our results suggest that the availability of detailed projections on the impact of <b>discretionary</b> <b>measures</b> by broad tax category would be instrumental to a better monitoring of tax revenues developments in the EU in order to better identify the role played by non-policy factors (such as asset prices) in driving tax revenues. Given that the time span covered by this database is in most cases still relatively short (covering on average 7 to 8 years) future updates of the data would allow to further dig into the issue of the influence of <b>discretionary</b> <b>measures</b> on tax elasticities as well as to provide elements for a backward assessment of fiscal plans vs. outcome. financial crisis barrios Taxation <b>discretionary</b> <b>measures</b> fiscal policy financial crisis fiscal stance business cycle Fargnoli...|$|R

40|$|This study proposes an {{alternative}} measure of discretionary accruals {{that can be}} used in testing for intentional earnings management. Prior research has shown the prevalence of measurement error in all models used to estimate discretionary accruals (Healy (1985), DeAngelo (1986), Jones (1991) and modified Jones models (Dechow et al., 1995). The alternative measure proposed relies on the premise that managers use one or more components of accruals (accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, other working capital and depreciation) to manipulate bottom-line income in a given direction, consistent with their incentives. In other words, components of discretionary accruals are expected to be positively correlated. If they are not, this is an indication of high measurement error in the models estimating them. The alternative measure is tested in terms of its power (type II error) and specification (type I error) and compared to the traditional discretionary accruals measure. The power of the tests is measured in random samples with added accrual manipulation as well as a sample of firms targeted by the Securities and Exchange Commission for alleged fraud and a sample of firms that violated their debt covenants. The results indicate that the power of this alternative <b>discretionary</b> <b>measure</b> is higher than that of the traditional discretionary accruals measure. The specification (specificity) is tested in random samples chosen from the full sample as well as random samples chosen from extreme income and cash from operations observations and a sample in which discretionary accruals is a noisy measure of the estimated discretionary accruals. The results indicate that the specification of detecting earnings management behavior is improved by using the alternative discretionary accruals measure...|$|E
30|$|A further {{concern in}} the policy debate put forward by {{supporters}} of large and coordinated <b>discretionary</b> <b>measures</b> was that countries could limit {{the size of their}} programs at the expense of countries with more generous fiscal policy responses. The central factor behind this hypothesis is the degree of openness of an economy. The more open an economy is, i.e. the stronger the economic ties with other countries are, {{the more likely it is}} that a country gains from other countries’ fiscal stimulus packages or, conversely, the more likely it is that own fiscal stimulus measures spill over to other countries. Hence, the idea behind this argument is that some countries might show a free-rider behavior and profit from spill-over effects of <b>discretionary</b> <b>measures</b> 15. We find only weak evidence for this hypothesis. While the correlation between <b>discretionary</b> <b>measures</b> passed in 2008 - 2009 and trade openness is negative which is confirmed when we estimate a univariate regression between these two 16, the coefficient on openness becomes insignificant once our measure for automatic stabilization is included as can be seen in column (6) of Table 1. This is due to the fact that the correlation between openness and automatic stabilization is positive. All in all, our results suggest that policymakers did take into account the forces of automatic stabilizers when designing active fiscal policy measures to tackle the recent economic crisis.|$|R

The key idea behind it is to separate temporary and/or non-discretionary effects on budget deficit from the underlying balance and/or effects of <b>discretionary</b> <b>measures</b> of fiscal policy. The computation of CAB is based on the identification of potential level of economic variables. In this paper we demonstrate, that composition matters both in the case of real and nominal variables. Both European Commission and European Central Bank propose methods for measuring CAB, however, they are not fully capable of satisfying all requirements. Besides, results show that aggregated and disaggregated approaches provide different estimations {{for the benefit of the}} latter. In this paper we present an alternative method, which is able to incorporate the advantages of both approaches. Combining output gap from production function and constrained multivariate HP filter induces theoretically motivated disaggregated approach where we also exploit the implication of production function parameterisation.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} an econometric {{technique that}} deals with shortcomings of existing methods for estimating the tax elasticity and the impact on revenues of <b>discretionary</b> tax <b>measures.</b> This model highlights the roles that <b>discretionary</b> tax <b>measures</b> and economic growth play in effecting the shift from the taxation of international trade to the taxation of domestic transactions. The objective {{of this study is}} twofold: first, to develop an econometric method of estimating built-in tax elasticity, and, hence, isolating the revenue impact of <b>discretionary</b> tax <b>measures</b> from that of economic growth; and second, to apply this model to selected sub-Saharan Africa countries in order to highlight the contribution of discretionary actions taken by fiscal authorities to trends of tax effort and individual tax shares during the past two decades. The structural adjustment programs of developing countries use fiscal deficit reduction as one of the policy tools for achieving real economic growth with price stability and balance of payments viability. In dealing with this deficit within such a framework, projects need to be made of the additional revenues which can be mobilized within the existing tax system as gross domestic product (GDP) grows.

30|$|One general {{conclusion}} {{that can be}} drawn from cross-country comparisons of labor market responses to the economic crisis is that countries with existing policy measures to quickly adjust fare relatively well. In those countries, no imminent need for <b>discretionary</b> <b>measures</b> or extensive reforms emerges. Instead, they can rely on automatic stabilizers that are already in place, for example in the tax and transfer system. Another general lesson is that previous reform efforts pay off, also and maybe in particular during a crisis. The implementation of activation policies has certainly contributed to the relatively comfortable position when the crisis hit Germany. Therefore, “flexicurity” can still be regarded as the (European) role model for institutional reforms. Despite fundamental changes in the economic environment, the model of balancing flexibility in the labor market with generous social protection and active labor market policies does pay off.|$|R

Importantly, the evolving effect of discretionary practices is due not only to increasing use of these practices over time, but apparent changes in implementation of these practices that mean a higher increase in the dumping margin whenever they are applied. While legal changes due to the Uruguay Round are estimated to have reduced the baseline U.
