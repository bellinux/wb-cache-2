Fellow guest Billy Connolly threatened, [...] "If that bird comes anywhere near me, I'll break its neck and your bloody arm!" [...] Hull swiftly got his [...] "pet" [...] back on best behaviour. Parkinson had always lamented the fact that despite all the star guests he had interviewed over the years, he would probably be remembered for [...] "that bloody bird". However, in an appearance on the TV show Room 101, he got his chance of revenge when the host, Paul Merton, unexpectedly brought Emu locked in a guillotine on stage and Parkinson took his chance by beheading the puppet, saying, [...] "Goodbye, you foul beast." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{hand puppet}} {{is a type}} of puppet that is {{controlled}} by the hand or hands that occupies the interior of the <b>puppet.</b> <b>Glove</b> <b>puppets</b> are a variation of hand puppets. Rod puppets require one of the puppeteer's hands inside the <b>puppet</b> <b>glove</b> holding a rod which controls the head, and the puppet's body then hangs over most or all of the forearm of the puppeteer, and possibly extends further. Other parts of the puppet may be controlled by different means, e.g., by rods operated by the puppeteer's free hand, or strings or levers pulled the head or body. A smaller variety, simple hand puppets often have no significant manipulable parts at all. Finger puppets are not hand puppets as they are used only on a finger.|$|R
