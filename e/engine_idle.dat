5000|$|Idle speed (idling, or idle) is the {{rotational}} speed {{the engine runs}} on when the engine is uncoupled to the drivetrain and the throttle pedal isn't depressed (generally measured in revolutions per minute, or rpm, of the crankshaft of a combustion engine). The idle differs in two ways <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> and vehicle idle. At idle speed, the engine generates enough [...] power to run reasonably smoothly and operate its ancillaries (water pump, alternator, and, if equipped, other accessories such as power steering), but usually not enough to perform useful work, such as moving an automobile. For a passenger-car <b>engine,</b> <b>idle</b> speed is customarily between 600 rpm and 1,000 rpm. For buses and trucks it is approximately 540 rpm. In case of many single-cylinder motorcycle engines, idle speed is set between 1200-1500 rpm.|$|E
50|$|The {{system uses}} {{a maze of}} {{emissions}} vacuum hoses. Because of the many vacuum-driven components and electrical connections in the system, CEC-equipped engines have developed a reputation of being hard to tune. American Motors issued a Technical Service Bulletin to diagnose low or inconsistent <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> speeds on 1980 through 1988 AMC Eagle automobile.|$|E

50|$|An {{idle air}} control {{actuator}} or {{idle air control}} valve (IAC actuator/valve) is a device commonly used in fuel-injected vehicles to control the <b>engine's</b> <b>idling</b> RPM. In carburetted vehicles a similar device known as an idle speed control actuator is used.|$|R
50|$|A bad crank {{position}} sensor can worsen {{the way the}} engine idles, or the acceleration behaviour. If the engine is revved up with a bad or faulty sensor, it may cause misfiring, motor vibration or backfires. Acceleration might be hesitant, and abnormal shaking during <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> might occur. In the worst case the car may not start.|$|E
50|$|Bleed screws are {{not common}} on cars today and are only {{necessary}} when {{design of a}} vehicle's cooling system results in areas where air can be trapped in the system. Air in the system can lead to overheating of the engine and in modern cars also to poor vehicle operation (e.g. problems with the AC system or incorrect <b>engine</b> <b>idle).</b>|$|E
50|$|Air {{injection}} {{can also}} be achieved {{by taking advantage of}} the negative pressure pulses in the exhaust system at <b>engine</b> <b>idle.</b> A sensitive reed valve assembly called the aspirator valve is placed in the air injection pumping, which draws its air directly from the clean side of the air filter. During <b>engine</b> <b>idle,</b> brief but periodic negative pressure pulses in the exhaust system draw air through the aspirator valve and into the exhaust stream at the catalytic converter. This system, marketed as Pulse Air, was used by American Motors, Chrysler, and other manufacturers beginning in the 1970s. The aspirator provided advantages in cost, weight, packaging, and simplicity compared to the pump, but the aspirator functions only at idle and so admits significantly less air within a significantly narrower range of engine speeds compared to a pump. This system is still used on modern motorcycle engines, e.g. the Yamaha AIS (Air Injection System).|$|E

The blades had bent backwards. One of the blades had fractured at a location one third from the tip. The blade pitch angle was at the fine pitch stop. The rearward bending of the blades and the fine pitch of the blade angle indicate propeller rotation {{at the time of}} impact, with low or no power. It was learnt that the engine had problems of cutting off at idling speed on several occasions in the past. As the sortie involved an <b>engine</b> <b>idling</b> exercise, it could well be possible that it had cut off...|$|R

50|$|Though {{initially}} {{relatively inexpensive}} mobile radio system components, frequently damaged antennas {{can be costly}} to replace since they are usually not included in maintenance contracts for mobile radio fleets. Some types of vehicles in 24-hour use, with stiff suspensions, tall heights, or rough diesel <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> vibrations may damage antennas quickly. The location and type of antenna can affect system performance drastically. Large fleets usually test a few vehicles before making a commitment to a certain antenna location or type.|$|E
50|$|The {{batteries}} {{were replaced}} with two CNG tanks capable of {{maximum operating pressure}} of 3000 psi. The tanks could be refueled from a single nozzle in only 4 minutes. In-tank solenoids shut off the fuel during refueling and <b>engine</b> <b>idle,</b> and a pressure relief device safeguarded against excessive temperature and pressure.

50|$|While {{a higher}} {{compression}} ratio is helpful in raising efficiency, diesel engines {{are much more}} efficient than gasoline (petrol) engines when at low power and at <b>engine</b> <b>idle.</b> Unlike the petrol engine, diesels lack a butterfly valve (throttle) in the inlet system, which closes at idle. This creates parasitic loss and destruction of availability of the incoming air, reducing the efficiency of petrol engines at idle. In many applications, such as marine, agriculture, and railways, diesels are left idling and unattended for many hours, sometimes even days. These advantages are especially attractive in locomotives (see dieselisation).|$|E
5000|$|To limit power, all forced {{induction}} {{cars were}} {{fitted with a}} 34 mm diameter air restrictor before the turbocharger inlet, limiting the air flow to about 10 cubic meters per minute. The restriction was intended to limit power output to 300 hp although some WRC engines were believed to produce around 330-340 hp. [...] Engine development did not focus on peak power output but towards producing a very wide powerband (or power curve). Typically, power output in excess of 300 hp was available from 3000 rpm to the 7500 rpm maximum, with a peak of 330-340 hp at around 5500 rpm. At 2000 rpm (the <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> speed in [...] "stage" [...] mode) power output was slightly above 200 hp.|$|E

50|$|At 7:09, the airship made a sharp full-speed {{left turn}} to the west around the landing field because the ground crew was not ready. At 7:11, it {{turned back toward the}} landing field and valved gas. All <b>engines</b> <b>idled</b> ahead and the airship began to slow. Captain Pruss ordered aft engines full astern at 7:14 while at an {{altitude}} of 394 ft, to try to brake the airship.|$|R
5000|$|HYBUS {{is powered}} by an H-Series 6-cylinder diesel (BS IV compliant) engine that is not used to drive the vehicle ahead, but to charge the ultra-capacitors that powers the 150 kW {{electric}} motor. Automatic start-stop is used to decrease the overall <b>engine</b> <b>idling</b> time. The bus can restart using the stored energy when the engine is off. The fuel-efficiency of the engine thus increases and NVH (Noise-vibration-harshness) levels decrease.|$|R
500|$|The {{aircraft}} used reheat (afterburners) at take-off and to {{pass through}} the upper transonic regime and to supersonic speeds, between Mach 0.95 and Mach 1.7. The afterburners were switched off at all other times. Due to jet engines being highly inefficient at low speeds, Concorde burned two tonnes of fuel (almost 2% of the maximum fuel load) taxiing to the runway. Fuel used is Jet A-1. Due to the high thrust produced even with the <b>engines</b> at <b>idle,</b> only the two outer engines were run after landing for easier taxiing and less brake pad wear - at low weights after landing, the aircraft would not remain stationary with all four <b>engines</b> <b>idling</b> [...] requiring the brakes to be continuously applied to prevent the aircraft from rolling.|$|R
50|$|Neutral / No gear (N): This {{disengages}} all gear trains {{within the}} transmission, effectively disconnecting the transmission from the driven wheels, allowing {{the vehicle to}} coast freely under its own weight and gain momentum without the motive force from the engine. Coasting in idle down long grades (where law permits) should be avoided, though, with many transmission designs as the transmission's lubrication pump is commonly driven by the input (engine) side, which may not provide sufficient fluid flow at <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> speed for high-speed travel. Similarly, emergency towing (with the driven wheels of the disabled and non-running vehicle on the ground) with an automatic transmission in neutral is not permitted by the manufacturer for many vehicles. Manufacturers understand emergency situations and list limitations of towing a vehicle in neutral (usually not to exceed 55 mph and 50 miles). This is the only other selection in which the vehicle's engine may be started.|$|E
50|$|The T-80 design {{improved}} in several points upon the earlier T-64 design, introducing a {{gas turbine engine}} in the original model (which was denied for many years by western analysts), and incorporating suspension components of the T-72. This gave the tank a high power-to-weight ratio and made it easily the most mobile tank in service, albeit with acute range problems, as the turbine consumed fuel rapidly, even at <b>engine</b> <b>idle.</b> (Morozov's subsequent parallel development of the T-80UD replaced the gas turbine with a commercial turbo-diesel, to decrease fuel consumption and maintenance.) In comparison to its anticipated opponent, the M1 has a larger 1,500 hp (1,120 kW) gas turbine, but weighs 61 tons compared to the T-80s 42.6 tons, so it has a worse hp/t ratio of 24.5 compared to 27.1 and is less maneuverable than the T-80 (with GT). The T-80 can fire the same 9K112 Kobra (AT-8 Songster) anti-tank guided missile through the main gun as the T-64.|$|E
50|$|In June 2009, the New Meadowlands Stadium Corporation and the EPA {{signed a}} {{memorandum}} of understanding that outlines plans to incorporate environmentally-friendly materials and practices into the construction and operation of MetLife Stadium. The agreement includes strategies to reduce air pollution, conserve water and energy, improve waste management, and reduce {{the environmental impact of}} construction. The goal of the agreement is to save the emission of nearly 1.68 million metric tons of carbon dioxide during the stadium's construction and its first year of operation. Under this agreement, the stadium construction must use around 40,000 tons of recycled steel, recycle 20,000 tons of steel from Giants Stadium, install seating made from recycled plastic and scrap iron, and reduce air pollution from construction vehicles by using cleaner diesel fuel, diesel engine filters, and minimizing <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> times. Other goals of this agreement include providing mass transit options for fans and replacing traditional concession plates, cups and carries with compostable alternatives. The New Meadowlands Stadium Corporation is to report the progress on its goals to EPA every six months.
