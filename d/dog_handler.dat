25|$|A <b>dog</b> <b>handler</b> {{unit was}} founded in 1949 in the corps, {{consisting}} of about 50 soldiers and several hundred dogs. Its case was located in Kiryat Haim.

Today, a similar unit is operated by the Israel Border Police.|$|E

25|$|Many Canadian {{municipalities}} use dog squads as a {{means of}} tracking suspects. Most municipalities in Canada employ the bite and hold technique rather than the bark and hold technique meaning once the dog is deployed, it bites the suspect until the <b>dog</b> <b>handler</b> commands it to release. This often results in serious puncture wounds and is traumatic for suspects. A dog has the legal status of property in Canada. As such, developing case law is moving towards absolute liability for the handlers of animals deliberately released to intentionally maim suspects. The dog is effectively a weapon.|$|E

500|$|Ninnis was {{the father}} of Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis, a Lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers and Antarctic explorer. B. E. S. Ninnis {{accompanied}} the 1911–14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, under Douglas Mawson, as a <b>dog</b> <b>handler.</b> Along with Mawson and Xavier Mertz, he formed the Far Eastern Party, using sledge dogs to explore the area around the expedition's base in Adélie Land. On 14 December 1912, B. E. S. Ninnis died when the sledge he was walking beside broke through the snow lid of a crevasse. When news of his death reached Australia in March 1913, several Australian newspapers—including The Advertiser, the Western Argus and The Sydney Morning Herald—ran biographies of Belgrave Ninnis, noting his surveying work in the Northern Territory and Arctic exploration. When Mawson returned to Australia a year later, a telegram was sent on behalf of the Australian people to Ninnis senior, condoling him on his [...] "great loss, but congratulating you on your son's imperishable fame." [...] Ninnis replied the following day, [...] "Grateful thanks to yourself and people of Australia for sympathetic message." ...|$|E

40|$|Human {{hydatidosis}} is {{an important}} public health issue in India and many other developing countries. There is lack of data related to occurrence of this disease in certain risk groups. The present study was therefore designed to assess the seroprevalence of human hydatidosis among occupa-tional risk groups in Punjab (India). One hundred and forty nine human serum samples from <b>dog</b> <b>handlers,</b> veterinarians/ para veterinarians, dairy farmers, patients with liver disorders, HIV positives and control group (visiting hospital for other problems) were collected and analyzed using a commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results revealed that 23 (15. 43 %) subjects were seropositive for human hydatidosis. High seropositivity were recorded in <b>dog</b> <b>handlers</b> (30 %), fol-lowed by the other risk group populations. Relative risk of being infected {{was found to be}} 4. 80 times high in <b>dog</b> <b>handlers</b> when compared to control group population. Future studies must be planned to determine the significance of these findings and the status of human hydatidosis in India...|$|R
500|$|According to legend, Shackleton posted an {{advertisement}} in a London paper, stating: [...] "Men wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, {{long hours of}} complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in event of success." [...] Searches for the original advertisement have proved unsuccessful, and the story is generally regarded as apocryphal. [...] Shackleton received more than 5,000applications for places on the expedition, including a letter from [...] "three sporty girls" [...] who suggested that if their feminine garb was inconvenient they would [...] "just love to don masculine attire." [...] Eventually the crews for the two arms of the expedition were trimmed down to 28 apiece, including William Bakewell, who joined the ship in Buenos Aires, his friend Perce Blackborow who stowed away when his application was turned down, and several last-minute appointments made to the Ross Sea party in Australia. A temporary crewman was Sir Daniel Gooch, grandson of the renowned railway pioneer of the same name, [...] who stepped in to help Shackleton as a <b>dog</b> <b>handler</b> {{at the last moment}} and signed up for an able seaman's pay. Gooch agreed to sail with Endurance as far as South Georgia.|$|E

Atkinson, now the senior officer discovered that the <b>dog</b> <b>handler</b> Cecil Meares had resigned from the expedition and that neither Meares nor anyone else had resupplied dog food to the depots.
