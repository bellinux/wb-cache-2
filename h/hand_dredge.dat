50|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} methods were used on William Salthouse wreck site {{in an attempt to}} reduce the amount of scouring and prevent further damage. The first attempt included the construction of five small fences in 1985. The intention was that these fences, which measured 1 metre long by 0.5 metres high, would trap seaweed and other materials carried through the water and form a barrier which would cause a build-up of sediment. An inspection later that year indicated that this was not effective. A <b>hand</b> <b>dredge</b> was used to pump sand in from another area, but this was also unsuccessful. Bulk dumping was also conducted, but the result was only an ineffective light layer of sand.|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study is to identify potential blood cockle (Anadara granosa) induce spawning ground based on physical intermittency. A total of 132 sampling stations were recorded. A thermal power station situated 2 km away is discharging treated warm water (3 m MSL) which prevents cockle farmers from harvesting due to their maximum of 3 m long <b>hand</b> <b>dredge.</b> Thus, this information could be useful for cockle sustainable management plan in near future...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports the}} benthic megafauna that inhabit {{the coast of}} Huelva where the wedge clam fishery is carried out with hand dredges. Samples were {{collected}} seasonally using a specially designed <b>hand</b> <b>dredge</b> {{similar to that used}} by local fishermen but with a smaller mesh size bag (3 mm x 3 mm). 35 georeferenced transects were performed using a GPS device to standardize data to swept area. A total of 45918 individuals with a biomass of 52799 g were obtained. An inventory of 32 species belonging to 5 phyla was identified from February to November 2014 in these fishing areas. In relation to the number of species and biomass, the Mollusca phylum was the most abundant group followed by Arthropoda. The most dominant bivalve mollusc was Donax trunculus (84 %), followed by Mactra stultorum and M. glauca. The frequency index of D. trunculus was 100 % for each season, and maximum values of abundance and biomass were observed in spring and summer. Versión del edito...|$|E
25|$|Pieces {{of amber}} torn from the {{seafloor}} are cast {{up by the}} waves, and collected by <b>hand,</b> <b>dredging,</b> or diving. Elsewhere, amber is mined, both in open works and underground galleries. Then nodules of blue earth have to be removed and an opaque crust must be cleaned off, which {{can be done in}} revolving barrels containing sand and water. Erosion removes this crust from sea-worn amber.|$|R
2500|$|A narrow {{waterway}} {{known as}} the Split divides the island in two. Some people state that the Split was created by Hurricane Hattie in 1961 which devastated Belize City, however that is a myth. [...] Villagers who actually <b>hand</b> <b>dredged</b> it maintain that it is largely a man-made feature. [...] The Village Council Chairman at the time, Ramon Reyes, recounts that he and others dredged the waterway by hand after Hurricane Hattie opened a passage a few inches deep. This made a practical water way {{between the west and}} east sides of the island, intended at first for dugout canoes. The increased flow of tidal water has naturally dredged the opening to [...] deep until larger boats can now easily pass. The natural erosion continues to this day and threatens the soft sand banks of the waterway.|$|R
60|$|Upon this {{intelligence}} {{we ordered}} all <b>hands</b> to <b>dredging</b> again, {{on the west}} side of the island. This was in a narrow channel, between this island and a little cluster of islands which we found together extended west, the channel where our men fished might be about a league over, or something better, and the water about five or seven fathoms deep.|$|R
40|$|The Marine Extractive Reserve of Pirajubaé (MER) {{is located}} in the urban area of Florianópolis city (capital of Santa Catarina State, Southern Brazil), and has the bivalve known as “berbigão” (Anomalocardia brasiliana) as its main fishing resource. Based on 100 daily surveys carried out during 2005, this paper {{describes}} the berbigão fishery and presents the history of its management. A <b>hand</b> <b>dredge</b> (“gancho”) was used by 22 men and four women to catch the berbigão. The fishery is conducted predominantly in the morning and under water depths between 20 and 50 cm. On average, each fisherman swept 469. 2 m 2 with the dredge and caught 270. 5 kilograms of live clams per fishing day, summing up 888. 6 t landed in the RESEX along 2005. More than 97 % of the individuals in the catch exceeded the minimum legal size (20 mm total length). However, both individual size and total biomass of the stock reduced significantly over time. Most of the catch was processed (i. e. cooked and unshelled) and sold to very few buyers. Current management measures include: a) maximum number of authorized fisherman; b) days of the week and times of the day when the fishery is allowed; c) minimum distance between the iron bars in the ganchos’ basket; d) minimum legal size; e) space-time rotation of fishing areas and, f) reporting of daily production data. In spite of the large volume of scientific and traditional knowledge available and the existence of management rules discussed and approved on a participatory system, both the berbigão sustainability and the RESEX as a whole are threatened by administrative, social, economic, environmental and bureaucratic pressures. Neutralize such threats is a key challenge to be faced in this important federal conservation area of Southern Brazil...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey on}} plant-associated {{invertebrates}} in Lake Fibreno {{was carried out}} for the first time in 2004 with the aim to evaluate the fauna composition, distribution and diversity, and to define the lake ecological status. The basin (surface area: 0. 3 km²; maximum depth: 15 m) is an original example of a lotic-lentic system, located in Central Italy in a Reserve classified as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC, European Union Directive 92 / 43 /EEC). The lake originates from a complex of groundwater and surface karstic springs belonging to the Marsica hydrogeologic system and comprises a wide reed stand crossed by canals and the only floating island of the South Europe (diameter: abount 30 m). High flow and constant temperature (10 - 11 °C) characterize the lake water, which discharges in the Fibreno river at a flow of about 10 m³. sec- 1. Aquatic vegetation and invertebrates were collected bimonthly with an <b>hand</b> <b>dredge</b> in six stations during one year. Ten tipically lotic/lentic plant taxa were collected, which colonized mostly the 0 - 3 m depth range and were distributed according to water flow regimes. High numbers of zoological groups (28) were found, comprising 94 taxa, mostly represented by insects (34) and secondarily by nematodes, oligochaetes, gastropods and crustaceans, thank to the assemblage of invertebrates typical of lentic and lotic waters. The presence of indicator taxa and the measure of some bioindices performed on the invertebrate community have indicated an oligo-mesotrophic condition, with a trophic gradient varying from oligotrophy to mesotrophy according to different plant composition and lake hydrodynamics. Although some signs of eutrophication were revelead by high phosphate contents in the water, high concentration of organic matter in the sediments, disappearance of vegetation with respect to the past years, extensive growth of the sulfumbacterium Thiopedia rosea on the bottom, the plant-associated invertebrate community still showed a good ecological status following the positive effect of dilution-removal of nutrients caused by the continuous water flow of the lake...|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{the species}} and local conditions, bivalve {{molluscs}} are either grown on the beach, on longlines, or suspended from rafts and harvested by <b>hand</b> or by <b>dredging.</b> In May 2017 a Belgian consortium installed {{the first of}} two trial mussel farms on a wind farm in the North Sea.|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} seven {{populations of the}} wedge clam Donax trunculus, {{distributed}} throught the Spanish Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts. A comparative analysis of size and density was performed from a sample obtained from a commercially exploited population from Isla Canela, and from another population which is managed under a strict plan using only artisanal <b>hand</b> <b>dredging</b> from the beach of the Doñana National Park showing that the management {{carried out in the}} Doñana National Park is correct and allows sustainable fisheries. Twenty one microsatellite loci were isolated and characterized in D. trunculus of which 16 were polymorphic and codominant. At least 12 of them have high frequencies of null alleles in all populations, and the rest in most populations. All collected samples were genotyped with these 16 loci and genetic diversity indices, tests of disequiibrium, fixation indices and probabilities of genetic differentiation among localities were determined. The odds of assignment to the sampling location were also determined. Several analyses were conducted to determine the potential causes for the deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium which shown that they were mainly due to the presence of null alleles. Furthermore, using the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer it was determined that the commercially exploited populations of the wedge clam under the specific name Donax trunculus are actually a mixture of a hybrid and non-hybrid species. The analysis of the genetic structure made both to all individuals and separately for hybrid and non-hybrid individuals showed four genetically distinct populations in the Spanish coast. The first in the Cantabric Sea, the second in the Gulf of Cadiz, the third from the Strait of Gibraltar to Cabo de Gata and the last one from the Cabo de Gata to the Gulf of Rosas...|$|R
40|$|Acidic {{pollution}} {{can cause}} severe environmental consequences annually in coastal areas overlain with acid sulfate soils (ASS). A water quality model {{was used as}} an analytical tool for exploring the effects of water management options and other interventions on acidic pollution and salinity in Bac Lieu, a coastal province of the Mekong Delta. Fifty eight percent of the provincial area is covered by ASS, and more than three-fourths (approximately 175, 000 ha) are used for brackish-water shrimp culture. Simulations of acid water propagation in the canal network indicate that the combination of opening the two main sluices along the East Sea of the study area at high tide for one day every week in May and June and widening the canals that connect these sluices to the West Sea allows for adequate saline water intake and minimizes the acidic pollution in the study area. On the other <b>hand,</b> canal <b>dredging</b> in the freshwater ASS area should be done properly as it can create severe acidic pollution...|$|R
30|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{determine}} the mud rheological properties of the Chorfa dam (region of Mascara, Algeria) and to propose a rheological model that describes mud flow behavior. This study helps on one hand to give a better understanding of fine sediment transport dynamics in the dam, as well as contributing to reduce the dredging costs, and on other <b>hand</b> to valorize <b>dredged</b> sediments in road construction. Rheological measurements were conducted using an Engler viscometer and a Haake RS 600 rheometer. Mud samples were prepared with purified water at a range of solids concentration varying between 5.0 and 32.5 %. Besides, the physical, chemical and mineralogical characteristics of the Chorfa dam’s mud and the rheological tests were presented and the effect of solids concentration on mud viscosity was studied. The results indicate that the Chorfa dam’s mud showed a non-Newtonian behavior for solids concentration higher than the critical solids concentration, and the apparent viscosity increases with increasing solid concentration at different shear rates. In addition, for a fixed concentration, the apparent viscosity decreases with increasing shear rates, which approves the shear thinning behavior of the Chorfa dam’s mud. Fitting results of four rheological models (Bingham Plastic Model, Ostwald–de Waele (power law), Herschel–Bulkley and Casson) to the experimental data were presented. Hence, the Ostwald–de Waele model was the best fitting model for mud samples.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, the {{ecological}} effects of dredge plumes are usually managed {{based on the}} precautionary principle. Predictions of suspended sediment levels are made, which have to be compared to thresholds set by the responsible authority. Failing to comply may cause a project to be delayed and thus lead to additional costs. The precautionary principle however is vague and incorrect, since {{it does not take}} into account the benefits of the dredging activity. The proper question to ask is whether the dredging activity should be allowed to harm the ecosystem or the ecosystem should be allowed to harm the dredging activity. To be able to answer this question, ecological risk is required to be assessed in a quantitative manner. A suitable framework to do so is provided by the Ecological Risk Assessment (era), which enables a risk agent to include uncertainties explicitly. An era consists of a description of the system and its components, hazard identification, effects assessment, exposure assessment, risk characterization and an evaluation which provides feedback for a possibly updated system description. The effects assessment relates suspended sediment concentration and exposure duration to the response of a sensitive receiver. A graphical representation of this relationship is a dose-response curve, which represents the resistance of the species, or 'strength'. Field measurements or laboratory experiments are necessary to enable the development of dose-response curves for important sensitive receivers. The exposure assessment starts with the formulation of the dredge plume source term. The complex dynamic phase of the plume is not modelled, but is incorporated in the source term by means of established empirical relations. The passive phase is modelled by a hydrodynamic and transport model, which results in a time series of suspended sediment concentration levels at the location of the sensitive receiver. This is translated into a concentration and an exposure duration, which can be interpreted as the 'load'. When effects and exposure have been estimated, the risk has to be characterized. There are several ways to do this, which depend on the treatment of uncertainty. A probabilistic approach incorporates variability in exposure and effects estimates and a deterministic approach estimates one representative value for exposure and compares this with one representative dose-response relationship. A probabilistic approach enables the determination of a 'failure probability'. This provides confidence levels for the obtained results and points to gaps in knowledge. In general, insight in probabilities is assumed to enable a better risk assessment. When these methods are applied in practice, it depends on the situation at hand which technique is most suitable to estimate risk. In the design and planning phase of dredging works a probabilistic analysis is the preferred option, to identify possible new areas of investigation or research or to support the development of a monitoring strategy. It is however computationally expensive to carry out a Monte Carlo analysis to assess long-term exposure. On the other <b>hand,</b> when <b>dredging</b> works are already in progress, a deterministic analysis satisfies the desire for a quick assessment of the risks. Execution methods can in that stage still be changed and mitigating measures might still be implemented. In conclusion, for a quantitative assessment of ecological risk it is necessary to carry out a probabilistic analysis. Costs and benefits of a dredging project can then be determined, which enables a complete economic analysis and a transparent decision making process.
