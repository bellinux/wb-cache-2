25|$|My son! I {{have always}} been a {{careless}} and injudicious mother to you, and I am about to propose a most imprudent step. You are now of age, and it's high time you began to think of taking a wife. Several old and hideous princesses who are enormously poor have proposed for your <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think it high time you began to think of making one of them unhappy.|$|E
500|$|In {{regards to}} the outcome, Rosolie {{explained}} that the anaconda [...] " [...] my arm into a position where her force was fully on my exposed arm. I started to feel the blood drain out of my <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> felt the bone flex. And when I {{got to the point}} where I felt like it was going to snap, I had to tap out." ...|$|E
500|$|... "get {{it out of}} here, get it {{away from}} the guys and myself. And I reached over, leaned over to the right, grabbed it with my <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> threw it as hard as I could, what I thought was at the time. And as soon as I opened my hand to let it go, it just {{exploded}} instantly. And I came back, and the hand was completely severed off."The detonation amputated his right hand, and sprayed his body with shrapnel. Petry likely saved the two other soldiers from serious injury or death.|$|E
60|$|I fell on {{my knees}} at his feet, <b>and</b> kissed his <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> believe that I wept.|$|R
5000|$|Have pity on me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{will have}} pity on you. Give me my <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{will give you}} peace. The more you honour me, the more I will bless you.|$|R
60|$|The big {{fellow was}} mad as a hornet. When {{he got to}} me he grasped me with his great fence-rail {{splitting}} <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> cried out with pain.|$|R
500|$|Jackson {{also spoke}} about O'Neal in 2001 with Rabbi Shmuley. He {{described}} holding hands with her: [...] "I was, like, in heaven. It {{was the most}} magical thing. It was better than kissing her, {{it was better than}} anything." [...] He recalled one of the times they held hands:I remember we went to this club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called the Roxy. And I was watching the band, I was sitting there, and underneath the table, she was holding my <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off. It was all I needed. But that means nothing to kids today. She grew up too fast. She wasn't into innocence, and I love that.|$|E
500|$|Critics universally acknowledged, {{but gave}} mixed {{opinions}} on, the game's {{high level of}} difficulty. This sentiment was epitomized by Sliva's comment that [...] "Don't Starve will never, ever hold your <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> both love it and hate it for that." [...] For example, he felt some of his deaths were unfairly caused by the game's camera system obscuring needed objects. Meunier stated that [...] "survival doesn't come easy, but there's an undeniable thrill to the challenge," [...] but also placed the high difficulty in his list of the game's cons. Leon Hurley of Official PlayStation Magazine claimed that [...] "learning is half the fun and even the smallest victory {{makes you feel like}} you’re winning with a capital FU." [...] Reviewers also felt that players' levels of satisfaction would depend heavily on their levels of commitment to survival.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} escalated to {{the point}} where death threats were sent to Time-Warner executives, and stockholders threatened {{to pull out of the}} company. Finally, Ice-T decided to remove [...] "Cop Killer" [...] from the album of his own volition, a decision which was met by criticism from other artists who derided Ice-T for [...] "caving in to external pressure." [...] In an interview, Ice-T stated that [...] "I didn't want my band to get pigeon-holed as that's the only reason that record sold. It just got outta <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was just tired of hearing it. I said, 'fuck it,' I mean they're saying we did it for money, and we didn't. I'd gave the record away, ya know, let's move on, let's get back to real issues, not a record, but the cops that are out there killing people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, nay; but join <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{will take}} thee, where thy Past shall be forgotten; where thou wilt soon {{learn to love}} the living, not the dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rise early, and be by {{me all the}} day. There will be {{much work}} on my <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall be hurt between my neck and my shoulder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A sad truth," [...] replied Gurth; [...] "but {{if these}} same thirty zecchins will buy my freedom from you, unloose my <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will pay them to you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Hynek {{reported}} bitter {{exchanges with}} Moody when the latter refused to research UFO sightings thoroughly, describing Moody as “the {{master of the}} possible: possible balloon, possible aircraft, possible birds, which then became, by his own <b>hand</b> (<b>and</b> <b>I</b> argued with him violently at times) the probable.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Rav Huna deduced from Judah's {{commitment}} to Jacob {{with regard to}} Benjamin in [...] "I will be surety for him; of my hand shall you require him," [...] that a guarantor becomes responsible for the debt that he has guaranteed. Rav Hisda, however, demurred, saying that Judah assumed an unconditional obligation to return Benjamin, for in [...] Reuben promised, [...] "Deliver him into my <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will {{bring him back to}} you," [...] and Judah surely promised no less than Reuben.|$|E
2500|$|A further {{significant}} motif is metaphor related to violence; [...] "the world of Titus {{is not simply}} one of meaningless acts of random violence but rather one in which language engenders violence and violence is done to language through the distance between word and thing, between metaphor and what it represents." [...] For example, in 3.1 when Titus asks Aaron to cut off his hand because he believes it will save his sons' lives he says, [...] "Lend me thy <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will give thee mine." [...] Therefore, {{in the language of}} Titus, [...] "to lend one's hand is to risk dismemberment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he said, [...] "I {{only want}} {{something}} to stain my face <b>and</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall {{be able to pass}} anywhere, if it does not come to talking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He does," [...] said Margaret; [...] "he {{has taken}} her {{education}} into his <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> really believe he has taught her to hold up her frock and stick in pins." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hardly think that, Laura. You {{leave it}} in my <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will arrange it all. <b>And</b> now <b>I</b> must get to work, for the light is so very short on these winter days." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{went over}} to Lauren and dragged her down to the water. I held her head under the water. She was {{struggling}} and she knocked me into the water. One of my knees, I think the left went into the water. This pissed me {{off a little bit}} and I opened my knife, it was in my left <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> stabbed Lauren in {{the left side of the}} neck. I said in my interview that it was the right side of the neck with my right hand but I am been thinking since. It wasn't my right thumb which was cut but my left. After a couple of seconds after I stabbed her she stopped moving." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robinson {{walked a}} step ahead of us, but when he noticed me hurrying to catch up, he {{shortened}} his stride to accommodate mine. I kept reaching up for his hand, but he hadn't looked down and seemed unaware. Fannie called his attention to what I was doing, so he stopped short, bent low over me, his eyes wide and rows of brilliant teeth showing in a wide smile. When he took my hand in his, it felt large and cool. For a few moments, we continued walking in silence. [...] "Can I call you Uncle Billy?" [...] I asked. [...] "Why sure you can", he replied... "But then I get to call you darlin.'" [...] It was a deal. From then on, whenever we walked together it was hand in <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was always his [...] "darlin.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Labour MK Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said in May 2013: [...] "whether Assad {{remains in}} power or not, {{is not in}} our hands. We keep hearing {{intelligence}} assessments that {{he is about to}} go down. In my opinion, the current situation is the best one for us. Do the math: the other option is more chaotic, given that those expected to fill the vacuum are al-Qaeda and the Salafist organizations. It is better to face a state, because not having a clear address is much worse for us. There are almost 400 gangs operating in Syria, so with whom do you talk and who do you hold accountable?" [...] Minister for International Affairs, Strategy and Intelligence Yuval Steinitz said on 10 June 2013 that [...] "I always thought that it might be the case {{that at the end of}} the day Assad, with a very strong Iranian and Hezbollah backing, might gain the upper <b>hand.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> think that this is possible and I thought that this is possible already a long time ago. [...] might not just survive but even regain territories." [...] The statement was met with a cool reception by the foreign and defense ministries.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I gave {{my brother}} into your <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{said that if}} he died a brave man's death, I could ask for no more. You told me that such a death was his.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You forget Mr. Hurlstone," [...] said Brace, with ill-concealed bitterness; [...] "he {{seems to}} have time enough on his <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> dare say would sympathize with you. You women like idle men." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was sitting}} on the couch, white-faced, one sea-boot in his <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could have sworn his hands were shaking. That much <b>I</b> saw, <b>and</b> the next moment was out on deck.|$|R
2500|$|Among {{the many}} stunts shot {{there was a}} {{particular}} sequence in which Roshan had to dance using a large transparent ball as a property. The actor {{said that he had}} trained the hardest to practice spin in one of the dance sequence. Roshan said, [...] "I trained for a month. It was not a long piece of dance but there was lot of jazz ballet where I was required to spin as there is a ball in my <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am playing with it as well as dancing. None of my songs up till now have spin because I am very bad at it." [...] The cinematographer of the movie Sudeep Chatterjee was asked to interpret the script completely so that Bhansali could understand his perception too. Praising his director to be very open and cooperative Chatterjee acknowledged in an interview about Bhansali's penchant for closed spaces. He said that his main challenge was to make the scenes look different though the protagonist is locked in a single room. To make these differences the lighting was adjusted such that one sees the room in twilight, at night, during the day, in early morning. The camera was made always mobile to counter Ethan's stillness. Slightly mobile things were deliberately kept always around Ethan like a fluttering curtain, a fish bowl near Ethan's head which according to the cinematographer mocked at his stillness all the time.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{emptied the}} {{stiffened}} mould into my <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> devoured it ravenously.|$|E
60|$|Then Zikali {{waved his}} <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> went, {{wondering}} into what plot I had stumbled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{that is what}} I {{especially}} {{wanted to}} talk with you about. I have decided to ask your daughter to put herself into my <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hope you will give your consent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{early this}} morning, eh?" [...] {{returned}} the broker. [...] "Well, I {{wanted to get}} this correspondence off my <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{seem to be able}} to do better work early in the morning." ...|$|R
5000|$|Keynes's intellect was {{the sharpest}} <b>and</b> clearest that <b>I</b> have ever known. When I argued with him, I felt that I took {{my life in}} my <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> seldom emerged without feeling {{something}} of a fool.|$|R
60|$|Bib. Could you so, {{could you}} so, sir? {{give me your}} <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thank you heartily, Mr Loveby.|$|E
60|$|I {{believed}} her, as I warmly {{shook her}} <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> believe that I shall always {{continue to believe}} her.|$|E
60|$|The last promise, however, {{appeared}} {{fully to}} satisfy her. She kissed my <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> felt hot tears falling on it.|$|E
6000|$|Then said Diabolus, 'Deliver me, then, the {{men that}} have petitioned against me, {{especially}} Captain Credence, that carried it to your Prince; deliver that varlet into my <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will depart from the town.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then do but untie my <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{will fight}} thee and thy men with no weapon but only my naked fists. I crave no weapon, {{but let me}} not be meanly hanged this day." ...|$|R
60|$|She did {{not answer}} me with any word at all, but with a sudden little forward {{movement}} of both her <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw that her eyes were swimming in tears. Yet they shone into mine like stars, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw heaven there.|$|R
