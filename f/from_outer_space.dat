5|$|Jonathan Gems, who had {{previously}} written multiple unproduced screenplays for director Tim Burton, came up with his own idea for a Mars Attacks film in 1993. The writer pitched both concepts of Mars Attacks and Dinosaurs Attack! to Burton, who both decided that Dinosaurs Attack! would be too similar to Jurassic Park (1993). Burton, who was busy preparing Ed Wood (1994), believed that Mars Attacks! would be a perfect opportunity {{to pay homage to}} the films of Edward D. Wood, Jr., especially Plan 9 <b>from</b> <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> (1959), and other 1950s science fiction B movies, such as Invaders from Mars (1953), It Came <b>from</b> <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> (1953), The War of the Worlds (1953), Target Earth (1954), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) and Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956).|$|E

40|$|Tens of {{millions}} of meteoroids, solid bodies <b>from</b> the <b>outer</b> <b>space,</b> enter the Earth's atmosphere each year. They are pieces of stone, iron or stony-iron conglomerates, ranging in mass from fractions of a gram to hundreds of kilograms. Those that survive the passage through the atmosphere and fall to Earth are called meteorites. Meteorites are the most ancient and primitive rocks {{as old as the}} Solar system. The study of these enigmatic objects intrigued scientists since ancient times, not only about their place of origin but also about the conditions that prevailed there and gave rise to their characteristic chemical and mineralogical composition and structures. These primitive rocks are messengers <b>from</b> the <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> that carry with them precious secrets about the formation of the Solar system, depends on us to reveal them.

500|$|The {{film has}} been {{considered}} a cult classic. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an average score of 71%, based on 17 critic reviews. The site's consensus reads: [...] "Killer Klowns <b>from</b> <b>Outer</b> <b>Spaces</b> title promises darkly goofy fun – {{and more often than}} not, the movie delivers." [...] Leonard Klady of The New York Times wrote that the film [...] "demonstrates both above-average technical skill and large dollops of imagination". Film critic Leonard Maltin initially declared the film a BOMB ("Strictly tenth-rate."), but gave the movie a second look after a few years; this time, Maltin awarded the picture two-and-a-half out of a possible four stars. In his second review, Maltin wrote [...] "Routinely plotted, but vividly designed, with cheeky humor...plays its premise to the hilt, all 'circus' bases touched".|$|R

5|$|Wood {{shoots a}} film with Lugosi outside his home. When Wood and company attend the premiere for Bride of the Monster, an angry mob chases {{them out of}} the theater. Lugosi passes away, leaving Wood without a star. Wood convinces his landlord, a church leader named Reynolds, that funding Wood's script for Grave Robbers <b>from</b> <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> would result in a box office success, and {{generate}} enough money for Reynolds' dream project. Dr. Tom Mason, O'Hara's chiropractor, is chosen to be Lugosi's stand-in for resembling Lugosi. Wood and the Baptists have conflicts over the title and content of the script which they want to have changed to Plan 9 <b>from</b> <b>Outer</b> <b>Space,</b> along with Ed's B movie directing style, his casting decisions and his transvestism. Wood leaves the set to go to the nearest bar, where he encounters his idol, Orson Welles. Filming for Plan 9 finishes with Ed taking action against his producers. After attending the premiere of Plan 9, Wood and O'Hara go to Las Vegas to get married.|$|E

Walt Disney Imagineering designed the booths to resemble convertibles of the period, and some servers act as carhops while wearing roller skates.

5|$|Unlike Earth, Venus lacks a {{magnetic}} field. Its ionosphere separates the atmosphere <b>from</b> <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> and the solar wind. This ionised layer excludes the solar magnetic field, giving Venus a distinct magnetic environment. This is considered Venus's induced magnetosphere. Lighter gases, including water vapour, are continuously {{blown away by}} the solar wind through the induced magnetotail. It is speculated that the atmosphere of Venus up to around 4billion years ago was more {{like that of the}} Earth with liquid water on the surface. A runaway greenhouse effect may have been caused by the evaporation of the surface water and subsequent rise of the levels of other greenhouse gases.|$|E
5|$|Hammer quickly {{sought to}} {{capitalise}} on its good fortune with a sequel. Staff member Jimmy Sangster pitched {{a story about}} a monster emerging from the Earth's core. However, when the company asked Nigel Kneale for permission to use the character of Quatermass, he refused, not wanting to lose control of his creation. Nevertheless, the film went ahead, as X the Unknown (1956), again capitalising on the 'X' Certificate in its title and featuring a newly created scientist character, very much in the Quatermass mould, played by Dean Jagger. Quatermass did eventually return to cinema screens in Quatermass 2 (1957) and Quatermass and the Pit (1967), both of which had screenplays written by Nigel Kneale and based on serials originally written by him and presented by BBC Television. Rival British film companies also tried to cash in with science fiction films of their own, including Satellite in the Sky, The Gamma People and Fire Maidens <b>from</b> <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> (all 1956).|$|E
5|$|Ted (Josh Radnor) is at {{the clinic}} to remove his lower-back {{butterfly}} tattoo, where he is attracted to his doctor, Stella (Sarah Chalke).

At the next session, Ted suggests waiting till his ten sessions are over before asking her out, but Stella tells him she will still say no. Ted still feels that over ten weeks, she will start to like him, so decides to keep trying. Even though the first five sessions go well, Stella confirms her answer is still no. Ted decides that being nice to the receptionist, Abby (Britney Spears), would {{be a good way to}} let Stella see his good side, but instead, Abby starts to show interest in him. Upset that this didn't work, Ted tries using a self-help book he saw in Stella's clinic. When he tries talking to her about this, she reveals it isn't her book, and she detests it, while Abby confirms that Ted was reading the book in the reception.|$|E
5000|$|The {{word space}} in space {{architecture}} {{is referring to}} the <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> definition, which is <b>from</b> English <b>outer</b> and <b>space.</b> <b>Outer</b> {{can be defined as}} [...] "situated on or toward the outside; external; exterior" [...] and originated around 1350-1400 in Middle English. [...] Space is [...] "an area, extent, expanse, lapse of time," [...] the aphetic of Old French espace dating to 1300. Espace is from Latin spatium, [...] "room, area, distance, stretch of time," [...] and is of uncertain origin. [...] In space architecture, speaking of <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> usually means the region of the universe outside Earth's atmosphere, as opposed to outside the atmospheres of all terrestrial bodies.
