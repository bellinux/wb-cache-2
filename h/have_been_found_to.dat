5|$|Chemotherapy agents used in {{combination}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be effective against neuroblastoma. Agents {{commonly used in}} induction and for stem cell transplant conditioning are platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin), alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan), topoisomerase II inhibitor (etoposide), anthracycline antibiotics (doxorubicin) and vinca alkaloids (vincristine). Some newer regimens include topoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan and irinotecan) in induction which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be effective against recurrent disease.|$|E
5|$|In coal seams, coal {{balls are}} {{completely}} surrounded by coal. They are often found randomly {{scattered throughout the}} seam in isolated groups, usually in {{the upper half of}} the seam. Their occurrence in coal seams can be either extremely sporadic or regular; many coal seams <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> contain no coal balls, while others <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> contain so many coal balls that miners avoid the area entirely.|$|E
5|$|In {{treating}} In-stent restenosis (ISR) Drug Eluting stents (DES) <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{be superior}} to Intracoronary Brachytherapy (ICBT).|$|E
50|$|Meditation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> lead to high {{activity}} in the brain's left prefrontal cortex, which in turn <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> correlate with happiness.|$|R
50|$|L. rhamnosus <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> reduce {{intestinal}} permeability {{in children who}} suffer from irritable bowel syndrome, and it also <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> counter alcohol-related {{intestinal permeability}}.|$|R
50|$|Cardiovascular system: Social support <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> lower {{cardiovascular}} reactivity <b>to</b> stressors. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{lower blood}} pressure and heart rates, which are known to benefit the cardiovascular system.|$|R
5|$|Common {{locations}} {{for the start}} of seizures and neural networks <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be affected in the majority of epilepsy. Efforts to figure out how epilepsy occurs is working {{to take into account the}} different regions of the brain and the timing of their activity.|$|E
5|$|Females <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{experience}} different {{eating habits}} {{at different stages}} of their menstrual cycle, with food intake being higher during the luteal phase than the follicular phase. Food intake increases by approximately 10% during the luteal phase compared to the follicular phase.|$|E
5|$|Glucocorticoids <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be as {{effective}} as NSAIDs and may be used if contraindications exist for NSAIDs. They also lead to improvement when injected into the joint. A joint infection must be excluded, however, as steroids worsen this condition.|$|E
5000|$|Pregnancy <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} {{levels of}} cortisol in the body. In particular, breast-feeding <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> decrease levels of cortisol {{in the short-term}} even if a mother is exposed to a psychosocial stressor.|$|R
25|$|Modification of {{astrocyte}} coverage at the synapses in {{the hippocampus}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{result from the}} induction of LTP, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> linked {{to the release of}} D-serine, nitric oxide, and the chemokine, s100B by astrocytes.|$|R
25|$|Estrogen <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} the secretion of oxytocin and to {{increase the}} expression of its receptor, the oxytocin receptor, in the brain. In women, a single dose of estradiol <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sufficient to increase circulating oxytocin concentrations.|$|R
5|$|Multiple {{mutations}} in cTnI <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> cause cardiomyopathies. cTnI mutations account for approximately 5% of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cases and to date, more than 20 myopathic mutations of cTnI have been characterized.|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{prevention}} programs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{reduce the cost}} of treating obesity-related disease. However, the longer people live, the more medical costs they incur. Researchers, therefore, conclude that reducing obesity may improve the public's health, but it is unlikely to reduce overall health spending.|$|E
5|$|The {{common toad}} emerges from {{hibernation}} {{in spring and}} there is a mass migration towards the breeding sites. The toads converge on certain ponds that they favour while avoiding other stretches of water that seem eminently suitable. Adults use the same location year after year and over 80% of males marked as juveniles <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> return to the pond at which they were spawned. They find their way to these mainly by using olfactory and magnetic cues. Toads experimentally moved elsewhere and fitted with tracking devices <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be able to locate their chosen breeding pond when the displacement exceeded three kilometres (two miles).|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> possess {{clinically}} significant albeit weak antiandrogen activity at high doses. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> directly and competitively displace testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and antagonize the androgen receptor (AR) in animals. In addition, cimetidine <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> inhibit 2-hydroxylation of estradiol (via inhibition of CYP450 enzymes, which {{are involved in}} the metabolic inactivation of estradiol), resulting in increased levels of estrogen. By increasing estrogen levels, cimetidine can also decrease testosterone and increase prolactin levels.|$|R
5000|$|The only widely studied emotion, {{with respect}} to persuasion, <b>is</b> fear. Fear <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> force {{individuals}} [...] "to break from routine and {{pay close attention to}} the external world," [...] including persuasive messages. Moreover, fear <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> encourage political engagement: ...|$|R
50|$|MK-386 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{significantly}} decrease {{concentrations of}} DHT in sebum, similarly to the selective 5α-reductase type II inhibitor finasteride. However, whereas finasteride results {{in only a}} modest reduction in sebum DHT levels of 15%, MK-386 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> produce a significantly greater reduction of 55%. While finasteride decreases semen DHT levels by approximately 88%, MK-386 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no effect on levels of DHT in semen. These findings are {{in accordance with the}} known tissue distribution of 5α-reductase isoforms.|$|R
5|$|Their limited {{dispersal}} {{makes the}} newts {{especially vulnerable to}} fragmentation, i.e. the loss of connections for exchange between suitable habitats. High concentrations of road salt <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be lethal to crested newts.|$|E
5|$|After a duel, it {{is common}} for two male giraffes to caress and court each other. Such {{interactions}} between males <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be more frequent than heterosexual coupling. In one study, up to 94 percent of observed mounting incidents took place between males. The proportion of same-sex activities varied from 30–75 percent. Only one percent of same-sex mounting incidents occurred between females.|$|E
5|$|All nuthatches {{appear to}} store food, {{especially}} seeds, in tree crevices, in the ground, under small stones, or behind bark flakes, and these caches are remembered {{for as long}} as 30 days. Similarly, the rock nuthatches wedge snails into suitable crevices for consumption in times of need. European nuthatches <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> avoid using their caches during benign conditions in order to save them for harsher times.|$|E
25|$|Triclosan <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a weak {{endocrine}} disruptor, {{though the}} relevance of this to humans is uncertain. The compound <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> bind with low affinity to both the androgen receptor and the estrogen receptor, where both agonistic and antagonistic responses <b>have</b> <b>been</b> observed.|$|R
50|$|Treatment {{for this}} rare genetic {{disorder}} can be physical therapy, there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> antibiotics <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> affective, and surgery <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> another solution.|$|R
5|$|Astemizole <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> anti-prion activity.|$|R
5|$|Although no {{distinguishing}} structural features <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{separate the}} workers and queens, the male is easily identified by its bulging eyes, subquadrate clypeus, and slender antennae. P. exclamans males are also more variable in external morphology compared to females. This is possible given the male’s hemizygosity (females are homozygous).|$|E
5|$|Anteaters, aardvarks, pangolins, {{echidnas}} and numbats {{have special}} adaptations for {{living on a}} diet of ants. These adaptations include long, sticky tongues to capture ants and strong claws to break into ant nests. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> feed on ants. About 12%, 16%, and 4% of their faecal volume in spring, summer, and autumn, respectively, is composed of ants.|$|E
5|$|Autism is a {{disorder}} of neural development characterized by {{impaired social interaction}} and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behaviour. Typically there is particular difficulty acquiring expressive communication skills. People with autism <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> have strong visual processing skills, making them good candidates for an AAC approach.|$|E

5|$|Birth {{control is}} also being {{considered}} {{as an alternative to}} hunting as a means of controlling overpopulation in wild animals. Contraceptive vaccines <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be effective {{in a number of different}} animal populations. Kenyan goat herders fix a skirt, called an olor, to male goats to prevent them from impregnating female goats.|$|E
5|$|Circumstantial {{evidence}} supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> display a preparedness for social interaction. This preparedness {{is expressed in}} ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of socialization or social construction. Rather, newborns most likely inherit to some extent social behavior and identity through genetics.|$|E
5|$|Currently, it {{is unclear}} whether waves are an {{efficient}} heating mechanism. All waves except Alfvén waves <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> dissipate or refract before reaching the corona. In addition, Alfvén waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.|$|E
