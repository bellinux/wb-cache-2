5|$|In 1971, Leicester were {{promoted}} back to Division One, {{and won the}} Charity Shield <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> time. Unusually, due {{to double}} winners Arsenal's commitments in European competition, Division Two winners Leicester were invited to play FA Cup runners-up Liverpool, beating them 1–0 thanks to a goal by Steve Whitworth. Jimmy Bloomfield was appointed for the new season, and his team remained in the First Division for his tenure. No period since Bloomfield has seen the club remain in the top division for so long. Leicester reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1973–74.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1886, Macdonald {{traveled}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> time to western Canada, traveling {{from town to town}} by private railway car, and addressing large crowds.

On 13 August 1886, Macdonald used a silver hammer and pounded a gold spike to complete the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway.|$|E

5|$|After Cochrane, no manager won {{a trophy}} until Bob Stokoe {{led the team}} to their second FA Cup with a 1–0 win over Leeds United in the 1973 FA Cup Final. Stokoe took Sunderland into European {{competition}} {{for the first time}} in their history, but they were knocked out in the second round of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup by Sporting Clube de Portugal. Len Ashurst led Sunderland to their first League Cup final, which they lost 1–0 to Norwich City, but relegation brought him the sack at the end of the season. Under Lawrie McMenemy, Sunderland were relegated to the Third Division <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> time in their history.

5|$|After {{the teams}} traded punts {{to open the}} second half, Derrick Henry made the score 31–24 with his 43-yard {{touchdown}} run <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> points scored in the third quarter. Oklahoma next scored on their opening possession of the fourth quarter on a nine-yard Knight touchdown pass to Shepard that capped an eight-play drive. Later in the quarter, Henry scored his second long touchdown of the game for Alabama on a 61—yard reception from McCarron that cut the Oklahoma lead to 38–31. However, the Sooners closed {{the game with a}} long drive that ran down the clock and in the final minute, an Eric Striker sack of McCarron caused a fumble that Grissom recovered and returned eight-yards for a touchdown and made the final score 45–31. The loss brought Alabama's all-time record against the Sooners 1–3–1.|$|E
5|$|Among {{defensive}} players, Florida State safety Nick Moody had 12tackles, {{the most}} in the game. Virginia Tech's leading defensive player was safety Eddie Whitley, who had ninetackles and two pass breakups. Tech's Davon Morgan and Jeron Gouveia-Winslow were responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> turnovers in the game; each had one interception. Gouveia-Winslow’s 24-yard interception return for a touchdown was the second such score in an ACC Championship Game. On {{the opposite side of the}} ball, Nigel Bradham's defensive two-point conversion was only the fifth in all of college football during the 2010 season. Florida State received no penalties during the game, and Virginia Tech received only four. The fourpenalties were the fewest in an ACC Championship Game.|$|E

5|$|As was {{the case}} in Boston, Lee Smith's first game with St. Louis went poorly as he gave up two runs in his only inning of pitching. He {{recovered}} quickly, registered a 0.00 ERA for the entire month of July, and finished his partial season with St. Louis with a 2.10 ERA and 27 saves. The Cardinals, however, were at a low point in 1990, finishing in last place <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> time since 1918. In 1991, St. Louis righted their ship, and Smith accumulated saves at a record pace. With his salary roughly doubled to nearly $2.8 million, Smith reached 40 saves {{for the first time in}} his career. On September 28, he picked up save number 45 to tie Bruce Sutter's National League record from 1984 (Coincidentally, when Sutter and Smith reached 45 saves in their respective seasons, both were ex-Cubs pitching for St. Louis against the Cubs). Smith claimed the league record for himself three days later and finished the season with a career-high 47 saves. One difference for him in 1991 was walks as he surrendered only 1.60 walks per nine innings, by far the best in his career to that point. Smith won his first Rolaids Relief Award, received the most significant consideration for league MVP in his career, and finished second in Cy Young Award voting behind only Tom Glavine, who had a breakout 20-win season in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Bellerophon rendezvoused with Jervis's fleet in the Bay of Cadiz on 30 May 1797. Three {{days later}} she was visited <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> time by Horatio Nelson, then a rear-admiral and {{in command of the}} inshore {{squadron}} of the blockading fleet. Bellerophon was with the fleet in the Bay of Cadiz until October, when Jervis took it to sea to patrol between Cape Trafalgar and Cape St. Vincent. These duties lasted until late May 1798, when Bellerophon was assigned to a detached squadron under Captain Thomas Troubridge and ordered to rendezvous with and reinforce Nelson's squadron. Nelson was in the Mediterranean hunting for a large French fleet which had sailed from Toulon carrying troops.|$|E
5|$|C.T. Rogerson {{was born}} on October 2, 1918, in Ogden, Utah, to parents Elijah Knapp Rogerson (1899–1956) and Mable Crissie Clarke Rogerson (1897–1987). Upon {{graduating from high school}} in 1936, he {{enrolled}} in Weber Junior College (since renamed to Weber State University) for the following two years. Rogerson then attended Utah State University, where he had hoped to work under the supervision of botanist Bassett Maguire, but settled instead <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> available studentship with plant pathologist B.L. Richards. Rogerson received his bachelor of science from Utah State University in 1940. Soon after, he was drafted into the army, and spent three years (1942–1945) in the Pacific Theater of World War II. He served as a technical sergeant in laboratory and pharmacy at an army evacuation hospital, and cared for internees released in the Philippines near the war's end. During his war years, Rogerson made collections of plants, fungi, slime molds, and butterflies that he sent to Cornell or to the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
