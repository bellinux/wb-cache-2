50|$|The Freedom of the Borough is {{the highest}} honour the council can bestow.

5000|$|A {{fluorescent}} lamp crusher {{consists of a}} [...] vacuum-sealed container, often a 55-gallon steel drum, in which glass fragments collect after passing through an entry tube and crushing mechanism. The mercury content of the lamp is contained by the vacuum and trapped in a filter arrangement, which must be replaced periodically. Spent {{fluorescent lamp}}s are typically hand-fed into the entry tube, rapidly <b>drawn</b> into the <b>drum</b> by the vacuum seal and crushed in the motorized crushing assembly. Once the storage container is full, it is replaced and shipped to a recycling facility for processing. Several companies manufacture fluorescent lamp crushers, including Dextrite, Air Cycle Corporation, and Resource Technologies.|$|R
