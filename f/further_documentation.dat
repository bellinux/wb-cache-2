25|$|Individuals {{and groups}} such as the ones listed above are {{concerned}} that the bills are written to hide welfare and safety violations in the animal agriculture industry from the public view. While laws aimed at restricting documentation or employee applications directly restrict documentation, the third type of law (e.g. Missouri's) is said to be intended to promote the rapid prosecution of any business displaying such practices. However, critics of the bills contend that when all material must be turned over to authorities in such {{a short amount of time}} (generally within twenty-four hours), establishments can easily cover up or change their practices or fire the employee before <b>further</b> <b>documentation</b> can occur, making a thorough investigation of any farm virtually impossible.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1515, Gil {{noted in}} a {{correspondence}} to Hispaniola that a slaving armada under his command had cornered Agüeybana II in the adjacent islands, likely {{as part of the}} local Taíno community that had moved to Guadeloupe. The High Chief disappeared from record shortly afterwards. Two months later, Ponce de León led an incursion on the island, where the Spanish were ambushed by a contingent of natives and retreated. Towards the year' end, Humacao and Daguao led a final offensive, before surrendering in 1516. The Taíno continued exploiting the northeastern coasts to flee the Spanish and go into exile. Despite the advance of the mining operations in the former terrains of Loquillo and Humacao, reports of Spanish casualties continued into 1517, where the conquistadores noted that {{about a third of the}} natives were still belligerent. In 1518, the Spanish made an incursion to capture a high-ranking Taíno identified as [...] "Cristóbal" [...] in the Daguao, which may have been a reference to Agüeybana II himself, who had been known under that name prior to the conflict.
