5|$|The small Asian {{mongoose}} (Herpestus javanicus) {{was introduced}} to Hawaii <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the rat population. However the mongoose was diurnal, and the rats emerged at night; so it preyed on the endemic birds of Hawaii, especially their eggs, more often than it ate the rats, and now both rats and mongooses threaten the birds. This introduction was undertaken without understanding the consequences of such an action. No regulations existed at the time, and more careful evaluation should prevent such releases now.|$|E

Adeka's older brother had been killed in London, ensuring Solomon became chief of the tribe whose lands held massive amounts of oil: as he was an addict, these rights were signed away in favour of Hulbert Linck. Linck was killed by the CIA during the raid on the house.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> which {{genes are}} being transcribed, the cell {{separates}} some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical {{access to the}} DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, {{in the case of}} NF-κB-controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory responses, transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-α, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-κB. A nuclear localisation signal on the NF-κB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Ali's {{successor}} was Hamad bin Thuwaini, {{who became}} sultan in 1893. Hamad maintained {{a close relationship}} with the British, but there was dissent among his subjects over the increasing British control over the country, the British-led army and the abolition of the valuable slave trade. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> this dissent, the British authorities authorised the sultan to raise a Zanzibari palace bodyguard of 1,000 men, but these troops were soon involved in clashes with the British-led police. Complaints about the bodyguards' activities were also received from the European residents in Zanzibar Town.|$|E

They also tried to shut off German wireless communication to and from the US by having the US Marconi Company sue the German radio company Telefunken for patent infringement. Telefunken brought in the physicist Jonathan Zenneck and Karl Ferdinand Braun for their defense and hired Tesla as a witness for two years for $1,000 a month. The case stalled and then went moot when the US entered the war against Germany in 1917.|$|E

The first city to be completely overtaken by the Syndicate was Philadelphia because of the influence of Nixon and Zimmerman.|$|R
5|$|Beetles can be {{beneficial}} to human economics by controlling the populations of pests. The larvae and adults of some species of lady beetles (Coccinellidae) feed on aphids that are pests. Other lady beetles feed on scale insects, whitefly and mealybugs. If normal food sources are scarce, they may feed on small caterpillars, young plant bugs, or honeydew and nectar. Ground beetles (Carabidae) are common predators of many insect pests, including fly eggs, caterpillars, and wireworms. Ground beetles can help to control weeds by eating their seeds in the soil, reducing the need for herbicides to protect crops. The effectiveness of some species in reducing certain plant populations {{has resulted in the}} deliberate introduction of beetles <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> weeds. For example, the genus Zygogramma is native to North America but has been used to control Parthenium hysterophorus in India and Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Russia.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies are {{threatened}} {{in their early}} stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. Braconid and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some {{have been used as}} biological controls of pest butterflies like the large white butterfly. When the small cabbage white was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> it, some pupae that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies lay their eggs on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.|$|E
5|$|Russia's western borders needed support, and fortresses existed or {{were being}} built in Latvia, Ukraine, and Belarus. The concept of {{building}} a fortress in Lithuania was discussed without result in 1796, but became a critical concern after the French invasion of Russia in 1812 led by Napoleon. The Grande Armée managed to cross the Nemunas near Kaunas on its drive towards Moscow without major difficulties. An increasingly unified Germany troubled the Empire {{during the second half}} of the century. A fortress in Kaunas would present an obstacle to attacks from the west, preventing further incursions towards Riga and Vilnius. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the region, attackers would need to first neutralize Kaunas. Facing this possibility and evaluating the natural advantages of the city, Russian officials decided to construct a fortress there. After several delays, on July 7, 1879 Tsar Alexander II issued an edict ordering its construction.|$|E

As the Hero escapes imprisonment, he learns the Dark Lord is seeking {{a key to the}} Mana Sanctuary <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the Mana Tree, an energy source which sustains life. The Hero is befriended by the Heroine (named by the player) who is also seeking Bogard. The two find Bogard who recommends them to meet a man named Cibba. During his journey to meet Cibba, the Heroine gets kidnapped and was rescued by the Hero {{with the aid of a}} mysterious man. When they meet Cibba, he plays a message left by the Heroine's mother who reveals she is a descendant of the guardians of the Mana Tree and that her pendant is the key to it. The mysterious man, after discovering she holds the pendant, reveals himself to be Julius, Dark Lord's advisor, and kidnaps the Heroine. The Hero then attempts to rescue the Heroine but fails and gets knocked out of Julius's airship. The Heroine gives the Hero the pendant just before he falls off the airship.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers chose St. Vincent {{as their}} primary {{shooting}} location, as it contained the quietest beach they could find, and built three piers and a backlot for Port Royal and Tortuga. Of most importance to the film were the three ships: the Black Pearl, the Dauntless, and the Interceptor. For budget reasons, the ships were built on docks, with only six days spent in the open sea for the battle between the Black Pearl and the Interceptor. The Dauntless and the Black Pearl were built on barges, with computer-generated imagery finishing the structures. The Black Pearl was also built on the Spruce Goose stage, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> fog and lighting. The Interceptor was a re-dressed Lady Washington, a full-scale replica sailing ship from Aberdeen, Washington, fully repainted before going on a 40-day voyage beginning December 2, 2002, arriving on location on January 12, 2003. A miniature was also built for the storm sequence.|$|E
5|$|The {{third phase}} of the project {{included}} several elements such as a powerful main engine whose propellant was pressure fed, a computer and a unit to measure inertia <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> maneuvers. In addition, a long and close range radar system was required to guide the satellite (the system {{was taken from the}} Westinghouse radar used in Bomarc surface-to-air missiles), as were lights to illuminate the other satellite, and four cameras for observation. A radiation detector was to be installed to determine if a satellite was carrying either a nuclear weapon or something whose power source involved a radioactive substance. Other sensors included infrared and gravimetric sensors to ascertain the mass of the other satellite, while defensive counter measures would be installed to identify decoys, booby traps, anti-jamming devices, and enemy attack, along with nitrogen cold gas thrusters for orientation.|$|E

5|$|The French and Indian War {{was between}} the nations of Great Britain and France, along with the {{numerous}} Native American Nations allied with both. The French and Indian war was the North American theater of the Seven Years' War being fought in Europe at the time. Growing population in British territory throughout North America forced expansion west; however, this was met with resistance from the French and their Native American allies. French forces began entering British territory, building numerous forts in preparation to defend the newly acquired land. The {{beginning of the war}} favored the French and their Native American allies, who were able to defeat British forces time and again, and it was not until 1756 that the British were able to hold off their opposition. Pittsburgh was a center for fighting during the French and Indian War, namely because of the geographical location at the center where three rivers unite: the Allegheny, the Monongahela and the Ohio. The location of present-day Pittsburgh provided an advantage in naval control. Ownership of this point provided not only naval dominance, but it also expanded economic ventures, enabling shipments to be sent and received with relative ease. French and British forces both claimed ownership to this region; the French installing Fort Duquesne and the British with Fort Pitt. Fort Pitt was established in 1758 after French forces abandoned and destroyed Fort Duquesne. The French and Indian War came to an end in 1763, after British forces were able to secure Quebec and Montreal from the French and on February 10, the Treaty of Paris was signed. The French were forced to surrender their territory in North America, giving England control {{all the way to the}} Mississippi River. The effects of this war were heavily felt in the North American British colonies. England imposed many taxes on colonists <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the newly acquired territory. These tensions would soon culminate into a war for independence as well as a shift in power for dominance in the economic world.|$|E
5|$|The Partition of Bengal in 1905 {{initiated}} the Swadeshi movement, {{which led to}} the boycotting of British goods in India. On 22 July 1908, Lokmanya Tilak, the principal advocate of the Swadeshi movement in Bombay, was sentenced to six years rigorous imprisonment, on the charge of writing inflammatory articles against the Government in his newspaper Kesari. The arrest led to huge scale protests across the city. The Bombay Chronicle started by Pherozeshah Mehta, the leader of the Indian National Congress, in 1910, {{played an important role in}} the national movement until India's Independence. Lord Willingdon convened the Provincial War Conference at Bombay on 10 June 1918, whose objective was to seek the co-operation of the people in the World War I measures which the British Government thought it necessary to take in the Bombay Presidency. The conference was followed by huge rallies across the city. The worldwide influenza epidemic raged through Bombay from September to December 1918, causing hundreds of deaths per day. The Lord Willingdon Memorial incident of December 1918 saw the handicap of Home Rulers in Bombay. The first important strike in the textile industry in Bombay began in January 1919. Bombay was the main centre of the Rowlatt Satyagraha movement started by Mahatma Gandhi from February— April 1919. The movement was started as a result of the Rowlatt Act, which indefinitely extended emergency measures during World War I <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> public unrest.|$|E
