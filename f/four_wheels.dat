5|$|The {{attitude}} was controlled with three hydrazine thrusters. The satellite transmitted data {{back to the}} ground with S-Band and Very High Frequency (VHF) transmitters, at a rate of 15 Mbit/s and 6 bit quantization. The satellite had three-axis fine attitude control with <b>four</b> <b>wheels,</b> which gave it +/- 0.7 degrees of control. The attitude control system also used horizon scanners, sun sensors, and a command antenna. A freon gas propulsion system allowed the satellite to make fine attitude adjustments. Landsat 2 could store 30 minutes worth of data on two wide-band video tape recorders.|$|E
5|$|The 747 has {{redundant}} structures {{along with}} four redundant hydraulic systems and four main landing gears with <b>four</b> <b>wheels</b> each, which {{provide a good}} spread of support {{on the ground and}} safety in case of tire blow-outs. The main gear are redundant so that landing can be performed on two opposing landing gears if the others do not function properly. In addition, the 747 has split control surfaces and was designed with sophisticated triple-slotted flaps that minimize landing speeds and allow the 747 to use standard-length runways. For transportation of spare engines, 747s can accommodate a non-functioning fifth-pod engine under the port wing of the aircraft between the inner functioning engine and the fuselage.|$|E

50|$|Rear <b>wheel</b> {{steering}} (<b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> steering) {{is available}} {{as an option}} on 2000 and 4000 series machines.The electronic system has 5 modes of operation, and only allows <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> steering below 20 km/h.|$|R
5000|$|In some versions, the car {{has three}} drive train options: two <b>wheel</b> drive, <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> drive mode that adapts power, and torque {{distribution}} between axles to improve traction, and a standard <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> drive.|$|R

50|$|Presented in Geneva 1992 (March), {{there was}} {{a version of the}} station wagon which offered the two litre engine, {{combined}} with permanent <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> drive. The <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> drive version had a slight front bias (56/44%).|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} civilian version, {{commonly called}} the [...] "flat fender" [...] Power Wagon or FFPW, {{was based on}} Dodge's 3/4 ton WC series of World War II military trucks. The civilian Power Wagon continued the Dodge lineage of <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> drive trucks from the 1930s, proving basic <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> drive design concepts and representing a significant predecessor to the many <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> drive trucks in modern use today. Updated variants continued in production until 1980.|$|R
50|$|Though over 300 Lohner-Porsche chassis {{were sold}} up to 1906, {{most of them}} were two-wheel drive; either front- or rear-wheel driven trucks, buses and fire-engines. Some <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> drive buses were produced, but no <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> drive automobiles.|$|R
25|$|A {{line lock}} is a {{temporary}} parking brake that makes use of the vehicles standard hydraulic brakes. Often used for off road conditions stopping on steep grades. By trapping hydraulic pressure in the brake lines, all <b>four</b> <b>wheels</b> can be locked.|$|E
25|$|A new front-drive {{platform}} underpinned the car, {{although the}} wheelbase remained unchanged and overall length grew by a lone centimetre. Weight-saving aluminum was {{employed in the}} hood, rear hatch, front axle and brake calipers (disc brakes were finally assigned to all <b>four</b> <b>wheels).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} {{low profile}} of the U. S. military Humvee was designed in part to allow it tilt farther than taller vehicles, without a rollover, because its low center of mass would stay over the space bounded the <b>four</b> <b>wheels</b> even at angles far from the horizontal.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Four</b> <b>Wheel</b> Drive Auto Company, {{more often}} known as <b>Four</b> <b>Wheel</b> Drive (FWD), was a {{pioneering}} American company that developed and produced all-wheel drive vehicles. It {{was founded in}} 1909 in Clintonville, Wisconsin, as the Badger Four-Wheel Drive Auto Company by Otto Zachow and William Besserdich.|$|R
25|$|Each {{carriage}} has <b>four</b> <b>wheels</b> {{on a fixed}} long-wheelbase, {{rather than}} the more usual arrangement of eight wheels attached to bogies. This arrangement has been criticised for causing loud noise and excessive wear to the wheels and track when going around tight curves in the track.|$|E
25|$|The Range Rover {{broke from}} the Land Rovers {{of its time}} by using coil springs instead of the then-common leaf springs. Because of its hefty weight, it also had disc brakes on all <b>four</b> <b>wheels.</b> Originally, it had no power steering, though this was added {{a few years after}} its introduction.|$|E
25|$|The 2CV design predates the {{invention}} of disc brake, so 1948–1981 cars have drum brakes on all <b>four</b> <b>wheels.</b> In October 1981, front disc brakes were fitted. Disc brake cars use green LHM fluid – a mineral oil – which is not compatible with standard glycol brake fluid.|$|E
50|$|The {{truck was}} meant for {{military}} and civil purposes. Krebs designed it in 1911, jointly with the Chatillon Co, the all-terrain truck named Tracteur Chatillon-Panhard, had <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> drive and <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> steering. Many of these trucks were used during World War I as artillery tractors.|$|R
50|$|There are two diesel {{locomotives}} {{of the type}} C-50 and a decommissioned MV Kuli. Three passenger cars have been built on the trucks of <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> goods wagons. In 2006 a larger <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> passenger car was built. In addition there are some well-worn goods wagons.|$|R
50|$|All {{variants}} use {{the same}} <b>four</b> <b>wheeled</b> platform.|$|R
25|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{implies that}} a sleeping driver often does not react {{and begin to}} recover, until all <b>four</b> <b>wheels</b> have struck a rumble strip; if the paved shoulder is narrower than {{the width of the}} vehicle wheel track, a rumble strip may not prevent a sleeping driver from going off the road.|$|E
25|$|As David Anthony {{writes in}} his book The Horse, the Wheel and Language, in Eastern Europe, the {{earliest}} well-dated depiction of a wheeled vehicle (a wagon with two axles and <b>four</b> <b>wheels)</b> is on the Bronocice pot (c. 3500 BCE). It is a clay pot excavated in a Funnelbeaker settlement in Swietokrzyskie Voivodeship in Poland.|$|E
25|$|Modern ABS applies {{individual}} brake pressure to all <b>four</b> <b>wheels</b> through a control system of hub-mounted sensors and a dedicated micro-controller. ABS is offered or comes standard on most road vehicles produced today {{and is the}} foundation for electronic stability control systems, which are rapidly increasing in popularity due to the vast reduction in price of vehicle electronics over the years.|$|E

50|$|Early wagons {{were built}} on <b>four</b> <b>wheeled</b> under frames, but from 1871 bogie {{vehicles}} begun to appear. The last <b>four</b> <b>wheeled</b> open wagons {{were built in}} 1958, but were not scrapped in large numbers until the 1980s when new bogie wagons replaced them, by 1987 the bogie wagon fleet numbered 5000.|$|R

25|$|For simplicity, most mobile robots have <b>four</b> <b>wheels</b> or {{a number}} of {{continuous}} tracks. Some researchers have tried to create more complex wheeled robots with {{only one or two}} wheels. These can have certain advantages such as greater efficiency and reduced parts, as well as allowing a robot to navigate in confined places that a four-wheeled robot would not be able to.|$|E
25|$|These were {{basically}} wooden boxes on <b>four</b> <b>wheels,</b> some with drop sides, and {{were used to}} carry everything from cut flowers in baskets to coal. Tracing of individuals is impossible, but apart from four new ones {{at the start of}} operations they were all second-hand. Numbers started at 15, reached a maximum of 35 in the 1930s, then 29 during the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Driving {{with all}} <b>four</b> <b>wheels</b> on unploughed land is another {{solution}} to the problem of wide tyres. Semi-mounted ploughs can be hitched in are heavier and more expensive than right-handed models, but they have the great advantage of leaving a level surface which makes seedbed preparation and harvesting easier. Very little marking out is necessary before ploughing can start and idle running on the headland is minimal compared with conventional ploughs.|$|E
