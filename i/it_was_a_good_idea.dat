5|$|The first {{attempts}} {{to create a}} breed registry in 1903 and 1904 failed. In 1912, another attempt was made, this time successful, and a stud book was created in Dijon in 1913. With {{the creation of the}} stud book, only purebred Auxois or Ardennais and Trait du Nord crosses could be registered. However, by 1917, the physical characteristics of the breed were still not fixed, and leaders of the equine community were critical, and doubtful of whether the Auxois was a breed in its own right or still merely a subtype of the Ardennais. They were also unsure whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> to accept the recognition of another regional breed, of which France had many.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. VIII Corps {{had arrived}} in the United Kingdom in December 1943, and was {{commanded}} by Major General Emil F. Reinhardt, who Middleton had known for many years. While he was an able commander, his lack of combat experience resulted in his being replaced by Middleton (though Reinhardt would later command a division in the European fighting). Middleton's first stop in Europe before assuming command of VIII Corps was to confer with his friend and commander, Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower had asked Middleton about his views on making Patton the commander of an army. Middleton thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> since Patton was such an able fighter. Eisenhower agreed, but was concerned about Patton's propensity to embarrass the Army by things he said to the press. Following this Patton was given command of the Third Army, which was headquartered north of London during the preparation for the invasion of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} Prison Break—a man deliberately getting himself {{sent to prison}} {{in order to help}} someone escape—was suggested to Paul Scheuring by producer Dawn Parouse, who wanted to produce an action-oriented series. Although Scheuring thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> he was initially stumped as to why someone would embark on such a mission or how he could develop it into a viable television show. He came up with the story of the wrongfully accused brother, and began working on the plot outline and devising the characters. In 2003, he pitched the idea to the Fox Broadcasting Company but was turned down as Fox felt nervous about the long-term possibilities of such a series. He subsequently showed the concept to other channels but was also turned down as it was thought to be more suited for a film project than a television series. Prison Break was later considered as a possible 14-part miniseries, which drew the interest of Steven Spielberg before his departure due to his involvement with War of the Worlds. Thus, the miniseries never materialized. Following the huge popularity of serialized prime time television series such as Lost and 24, Fox decided to back the production in 2004. The pilot episode was filmed a year after Scheuring wrote the script.|$|E

5|$|Robert Wise was in {{post-production}} on West Side Story {{when he read}} {{a review}} in Time magazine of author Shirley Jackson's novel, The Haunting of Hill House. Wise read the book and found it frightening; he passed it to screenwriter friend Nelson Gidding, whom he had worked with on the 1958 film I Want to Live!. Gidding did a full story treatment for Wise before proceeding {{to work on the}} adaptation. As Gidding crafted the screenplay, he came to believe that the novel was not a ghost story at all, but rather a compilation of the insane thoughts of the lead character, Eleanor Vance. He theorised that Vance was having a nervous breakdown, envisaging a scenario in which Hill House is the hospital where she is held, Markway is her psychiatrist, the cold, banging, and violence are the results of shock treatment, and the opening and closing of doors reflected the opening and closing of hospital doors. Wise and Gidding traveled to Bennington, Vermont to meet Shirley Jackson who told them that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> but the novel was definitely about the supernatural. Nonetheless, elements of the insanity concept remained in the script, so that the audience was left wondering whether the supernatural events in the film were in Eleanor's mind or whether they were real. It was also during their visit with Jackson that Wise and Gidding chose the title for the film. As {{they did not want to}} keep the book title, they asked Jackson if she had considered an alternative title. She suggested The Haunting, which Wise and Gidding immediately adopted.|$|E

With relocation looking likely, James Brayshaw began campaigning for the president position with the slogan 'Keep North at North'. On 7 December 2007 the newly appointed Kangaroos chairman James Brayshaw announced the club would not be moving to the Gold Coast and would continue to be based out of Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|The police {{plan was}} to move in at midnight on September 14 and evict the house while the squatters were still in their beds. In past evictions, the police did not assault a house until long after {{the moment of the}} deadline, and the hope was to take the squatters by {{surprise}} and minimize the time available for them to prepare their defense. A couple of days before the eviction was to take place, posters were hung up all over the city. The posters invited people to come to a demonstration in support of the house. The poster showed a large image of a burning car and the text said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> to show up with your face masked. This did raise some eyebrows at police headquarters, but in the end the police estimated that it was just a coincidence and that nothing big was underway. The police also thought that since the demonstration was held at 10:00 pm on a Sunday, not many people would attend.|$|E

5000|$|That {{is often}} omitted when used to {{introduce}} a subordinate clause—"He told me that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> read."

[...] Historically, [...] "that" [...] usually followed a comma: [...] "He told me, that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> read." [...] Middle Modern English grammarian Joseph Robertson recommended in On Punctuation that <b>a</b> comma <b>be</b> used with <b>a</b> conjunction. However, if the subordinate, conjunctional ellipse, null complement, or syntactic pleonasm of [...] "that" [...] <b>is</b> punctuated with <b>a</b> comma, then, in the English grammar, stylistically speaking, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> comma splice, especially in formal writing.

Epstein agonised about the decision, asking The Cavern Club's DJ Bob Wooler if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea.</b> Wooler replied that Best was [...] "very popular with the fans" [...] who would not like it at all. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August, over two and half months after the first recording session at EMI studios. Best was never given an explanation for his dismissal.|$|E

500|$|The {{release of}} the films saw a surge of {{interest}} in The Lord of the Rings and Tolkien's other works, vastly increasing his impact on popular culture. It was rumored that the Tolkien family became split on the series, with Christopher Tolkien and his son Simon Tolkien feuding {{over whether or not}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> to adapt. Christopher has since denied these claims, saying, [...] "My own position is that The Lord of the Rings is peculiarly unsuitable to transformation into visual dramatic form.

Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money. The five clubs decided <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of The Football Association and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not enjoy an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it as a way to weaken the Football League's position.|$|E

After evaluating the American Express and Citibank suggestions regarding a presale, WME decided not to pursue the idea, to which Mars' management agreed upon, a decision which ending up further promoting the Moonshine Jungle Tour. The idea was received with some skepticism within the team; some believed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> but most were reluctant and thought it was an awful idea, as buyers find presale a crucial element of tours. Cameron Duddy was chosen as the music director for the first leg of the North American tour.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{opened to}} mixed feedback, and aired {{back-to-back}} with [...] "Good Mourning", as a two-hour season premiere special. Alan Sepinwall of NJ.com {{commented on the}} two episodes being conjoined into one week: [...] "I keep {{going back and forth}} on whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> to do that, or if we'd have been better off spacing out the tearful speeches over two weeks. That isn't to say that there shouldn't have been tears, or speeches. George's death, no matter how marginal he had become last season, is and should be a huge event in the lives of these characters. Had the show raced through Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's famous five stages of grief, it would have rang false, as if everyone making the show was in a hurry to move past the events of the wildly uneven fifth season. My problem is, when you put two episodes back-to-back, those rhythms - the pace at which the acts build to emotional crescendos and then briefly recede - start to become too predictable, and it sucks some of the life and emotion away." [...] Sepinwall also praised Wilson's, Ramirez's, and Chamber's performances.|$|E

Its chief would be [...] appointed jointly by the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Chief of Naval Operations, along with a deputy from the opposite service. Both would be members of the Military Liaison Committee, because the Atomic Energy Act stipulated that the Military Liaison Committee was the sole military body that dealt with the AEC. In February 1947, Eisenhower and Chief of Naval Operations Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz appointed Groves as head of the AFSWP, with Parsons as his deputy. Accordingly, Groves was appointed to the Military Liaison Committee, although the newly appointed AEC chairman, David E.
