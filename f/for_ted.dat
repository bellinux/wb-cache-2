40|$|IntroductionThis study first {{verified}} the T classification, {{which is}} the major point of the revision regarding the seventh Tumor, Node, and Metastasis classification, from a viewpoint of the clinicopathological findings at the primary tumor site in {{non-small cell lung cancer}}. MethodsThe medical records of 1393 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent a complete resection at this hospital from 1974 to 2003 were thoroughly reviewed for pathologic findings and survival. ResultsAccording to greatest dimension of the primary tumors, the 5 -year postoperative survival was 77. 8 % <b>for</b> <b>T</b> 1 a (≤ 2 cm), 63. 3 % <b>for</b> <b>T</b> 1 b (≤ 3 cm), 46. 4 % <b>for</b> <b>T</b> 2 a (≤ 5 cm), 38. 8 % <b>for</b> <b>T</b> 2 b (7 cm). The differences among those new T categories were all statistically significant. The incidence of lymphatic permeation within the primary tumor was 17. 2 % <b>for</b> <b>T</b> 1 b and 29. 8 % <b>for</b> <b>T</b> 2 a (T 1 b versus T 2 a, p < 0. 05). The incidence of vascular invasion within the primary tumor was 24. 9 % <b>for</b> <b>T</b> 1 b, 35. 3 % <b>for</b> <b>T</b> 2 a, and 54. 2 % <b>for</b> <b>T</b> 2 b (T 1 b versus T 2 a and T 2 a versus T 2 b, p < 0. 05). On the other hand, the incidence of pleural invasion of the primary tumor was 18. 1 % <b>for</b> <b>T</b> 1 a, 29. 4 % <b>for</b> <b>T</b> 1 b, 49. 3 % <b>for</b> <b>T</b> 2 a, 47. 3 % <b>for</b> <b>T</b> 2 b, and 87. 5 % <b>for</b> <b>T</b> 3 (T 1 a versus T 1 b, T 1 b versus T 2 a, T 2 b versus T 3, p < 0. 05). Significant differences were observed among the newly revised T subsets in at least one incidence of lymphatic, vascular, or pleural invasion.
