25|$|The {{aircraft}} was rebuilt, and resumed flight testing on 2 February 1965. On 8 September 1965, the aircraft suffered another fatal crash, once again {{while in a}} low altitude hover. The {{aircraft was}} being evaluated by United States Air Force Major P. E. Neale, {{as part of a}} Franco-American information exchange on VTOL programmes. Major Neale made an unsuccessful ejection outside the ejection seat's <b>escape</b> <b>envelope.</b> The findings of the accident investigation were never made public. It was speculated that hydraulic control difficulties coupled with excessive use of the lift engines resulted in fuel starvation and the flameout of all nine engines. Once again, the damage was not irreparable, but this time the aircraft was not rebuilt, as flight development of the Mirage IIIV prototype was already underway.|$|E

A novel technique was applied using an <b>escape</b> <b>envelope</b> containing a reference drug {{which could be}} taken under controlled conditions if, after 48 hours, the patient experienced no relief. Significantly more patients on placebo opened the envelope than patients taking the active drug.

For the long term, a seated extraction system to expand the <b>escape</b> <b>envelope</b> is being investigated. This paper describes a 1987 study, conducted jointly by NASA/Johnson Space Center and Langley Research Center, to determine the feasibility of modifying the Space Shuttle Orbiters to incorporate the seated extraction system. Results of the study are positive, indicating retrofit opportunity and high probability of escape for early ascent, late entry, and even for uncontrolled flight such as the Challenger breakup. The system, as envisioned, can extract seven crewmembers within two seconds...|$|E
40|$|Through-canopy crew egress, {{such as in}} the Harrier (AV- 8 B) aircraft, expands <b>escape</b> <b>envelopes</b> by {{reducing}} seat ejection delays in waiting for canopy jettison. Adverse aircraft attitude and reduced forward flight speed can further increase the times for canopy jettison. However, the advent of heavy, high-strength polycarbonate canopies for bird-strike resistance has not only increased jettison times, but has made seat penetration impossible. The goal of the effort described in this paper was to demonstrate a method of explosively fracturing the F- 16 polycarbonate canopy to allow through-canopy crew ejection. The objectives of this effort were to: 1. Mount the explosive materials on the exterior of the canopy within the mold line, 2. Minimize visual obstructions, 3. Minimize internal debris on explosive activation, 4. Operate within less than 10 ms, 5. Maintain the shape of the canopy after functioning to prevent major pieces from entering the cockpit, and 6.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{radioactive}} decay of Al- 26 on the circumstellar envelopes of asymptotic giant branch stars are analyzed. The gamma-rays emitted by the product nucleus Mg- 26 <b>escape</b> most <b>envelopes,</b> but the beta-decay positrons are stopped and can ionize and heat the gas. The ionization may produce observable effects in C-rich circumstellar envelopes, particularly if the photospheric Al- 26 abundance is as large as inferred from measurements of live Al- 26 in the primitive solar nebula or the observations of interstellar 1. 8 MeV gamma-rays. For the nearby carbon star IRC + 10216, the measured abundance of the molecular ion HCO(+) provides an upper limit of about 4 x 10 (exp - 3) for the photospheric Al- 26 /Al- 27 ratio, consistent with presolar SiC grains with about the same C- 12 /C- 13 ratio...|$|R

40|$|We present {{scattered}} light images for models of young stellar objects surrounded by dusty envelopes.

We calculate images using the Monte Carlo method to follow the light scattered in the dusty envelope and circumstellar disk, assuming that the photons originate from the central source. Adopting typical interstellar medium dust opacities and expected mass infall rates for protostars of about 10 exp - 6 solar mass/yr, we find that detectable amounts of optical radiation can <b>escape</b> from <b>envelopes</b> falling into a disk as small as about 10 - 100 AU, depending upon the viewing angle {{and the size of}} the bipolar flow cavity. We suggest that the extended optical and near-IR light observed around several young stars is scattered by dusty infalling envelopes rather than disks...|$|R

Early that morning, it was decided to postpone the launch for 24 hours due to cloud cover at high altitude. The following morning an attempt was made to inflate the balloon. At around 6.55 AM with the balloon inflated to a height of 15 metres, helium began to <b>escape</b> from the <b>envelope.</b> An irreparable tear was discovered along one of the seams of the balloon, and all efforts for a flight in 2003 were abandoned.|$|R

Both must be protected; she must get the paper. Its loss would no doubt embarrass the conspirators, and would probably not be discovered for some time, but she must be quick. Their footsteps were almost noiseless, but she heard them go down the steps. Stooping swiftly, she drew her hand across the floor, found the envelope and thrust it inside her kimono.

Some of this salt <b>escaped</b> from the <b>envelope</b> at a postal sorting office, which was closed as a precaution so that tests could be carried out to determine whether the material spilt was dangerous. The Lords accepted that a significant number of people were disadvantaged by the closure of the sorting office and the loss of delivery on that day, but held that the appellant did not have the appropriate mens rea because he did not know or reasonably should have known (because the means of knowledge were available to him) that the salt would escape in the sorting office or in the course of postal delivery.|$|R
40|$|Specific {{neutralizing}} epitope {{changes have}} been observed in a chimpanzee infected naturally with SIVcpz, which differ from HIV- 1 infecting humans. To characterize further these changes, a longitudinal study of env genomic sequence variation of SIVcpz-ant isolates was undertaken in this animal. The V 1 and V 2 regions of the env were determined to arise from specific recombination events. To determine whether recombination of the V 1 and V 2 domains was possibly associated {{with the emergence of}} neutralization <b>escape</b> viruses, <b>envelope</b> sequences and gene length polymorphisms from PBMC and plasma viral variants were studied over a 7 -year period. PBMCs and plasma-associated infectious virus titers as well as plasma RNA viral loads were monitored longitudinally. The first 5 viruses isolated from the plasma were found to be neutralization escape variants. Sequence analysis of their V 1 and the V 2 regions indicated that a 20 amino acid stretch of the V 1 region had undergone recombination and was also associated with the emergence of isolates eliciting strong neutralization responses. These findings support the hypothesis that recombination of the V 1 and V 2 regions of the envelope play a role in neutralization escape of SIVcpz in chimpanzees infected naturally. Furthermore, the data confirm that the neutralizing antibody response {{plays an important role in}} the decline of plasma infectious virus titers in HIV- 1 related SIVcpz nonpathogenic infection...|$|R

40|$|Observations of early-type dwarf {{galaxies in}} {{clusters}} often show that cluster dwarf members have significantly higher velocities and less symmetric distributions than cluster giant ellipticals, suggesting that these dwarfs are recently accreted galaxies, possibly from an infalling group. We use {{a series of}} $N$-body simulations, exploring a parameter space of groups falling into clusters, to study the observed velocity distributions of the infall components along various lines of sight. We show that, as viewed along a line of sight parallel to the group's infall direction, {{there is a significant}} peculiar velocity boost during the pericentric passage of the group, and an increase in velocity dispersion that persists for many Gyr after the merger. The remnants of the infalling group, however, do not form a spatially distinct system [...] consistent with recent observations of dwarf galaxies in the Virgo and Fornax clusters. This velocity signature is completely absent when viewed along a direction perpendicular to the merger. Additionally, the phase-space distribution of radial velocity along the infall direction versus cluster-centric radius reveals the separate dynamical evolution of the group's central core and outer halo, including the presence of infalling remnants outside the <b>escape</b> velocity <b>envelope</b> of the system. The distinct signature in velocity space of an infalling group's galaxies can therefore prove important in understanding the dynamical history of clusters and their dwarfs. Our results suggest that dwarf galaxies, being insensitive to dynamical friction, are excellent probes of their host clusters' dynamical histories.

40|$|Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{belongs to}} Flaviviridae family of viruses. HCV {{represents}} {{a major challenge}} to public health since its estimated global prevalence is 2. 8 % of the world's human population. The design and development of HCV vaccine has been hampered by rapid evolution of viral quasispecies resulting in antibody <b>escape</b> variants. HCV <b>envelope</b> glycoprotein E 1 and E 2 that mediate fusion and entry of the virus into host cells are primary targets of the host immune responses. Results: Structural characterization of E 2 core protein and a broadly neutralizing antibody AR 3 C together with E 1 E 2 sequence information enabled the analysis of B-cell epitope variability. The E 2 binding site by AR 3 C and its surrounding area were identified from the crystal structure of E 2 c-AR 3 C complex. We clustered HCV strains using the concept of 'discontinuous motif/peptide' and classified B-cell epitopes based on their similarity. Conclusions: The assessment of antibody neutralizing coverage provides insights into potential cross-reactivity of the AR 3 C neutralizing antibody across {{a large number of}} HCV variants...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Stars with masses of> ∼ 20 M ⊙ have short Kelvin {{times that}} {{enable them to}} reach the main {{sequence}} while still accreting from their natal clouds. The resulting nuclear burning produces a huge luminosity and a correspondingly large radiation pressure force on dust grains in the accreting gas. This effect may limit the upper mass of stars that can form by accretion. Indeed, simulations and analytic calculations to date have been unable to resolve the mystery of how stars of 50 M ⊙ and up form. We present two new ideas to solve the radiation pressure problem. First, we use three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic adaptive mesh refinement simulations to study the collapse of massive cores. We find that in three dimensions a configuration in which radiation holds up an infalling envelope is Rayleigh-Taylor unstable, leading radiation driven bubbles to collapse and accretion to continue. We also present Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations showing that the cavities created by protostellar winds provides a valve that allow radiation to <b>escape</b> the accreting <b>envelope,</b> further reducing the ability of radiation pressure to inhibit accretion...|$|R
40|$|Long {{duration}} gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) {{have often}} been considered as the natural evolution of some core-collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitors. However, the fraction of CCSNe linked to astrophysical jets and their properties are still poorly constrained. While any successful astrophysical jet harbored in a CCSN should produce high energy neutrinos, photons {{may be able to}} successfully <b>escape</b> the stellar <b>envelope</b> only for a fraction of progenitors, possibly leading to the existence of high-luminosity, low-luminosity and not-electromagnetically bright ("choked") GRBs. By postulating a CCSN-GRB connection, we accurately model the jet physics within the internal-shock GRB model and assume scaling relations for the GRB parameters that depend on the Lorentz boost factor Γ. The IceCube high energy neutrino flux is then employed as an upper limit of the neutrino background from electromagnetically bright and choked GRBs to constrain the jet and the progenitor properties. The current IceCube data set is compatible with up to 1 % of all CCSNe harboring astrophysical jets. Interestingly, those jets are predominantly choked. Our findings suggest that neutrinos can be powerful probes of the burst physics and can provide major insights on the CCSN-GRB connection. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|Emergency crew escape {{capabilities}} {{have been}} less than adequate for fighter aircraft since before WW II. From the over-the-side bailout of those days through the current ejection seat with a rocket catapult, escaping from a disabled aircraft has been risky at best.

However, the advantages available demand that a capsule be developed. This capsule concept will minimize the inherent disavantages and incorporate the benefits while integrating all aspects of crew station design. The resulting design is appropriate for a crew station of the year 2010 and includes improved combat acceleration protection, chemical or biological combat capability, improved aircraft to escape system interaction, and the highest level of escape performance achievable. The capsule is compact, which can allow a reduced aircraft size and weighs only 1200 lb. The escape system weight penalty is only 120 lb higher than that for the next ejection seat and the capsule has a corresponding increase in performance...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a general radiative equilibrium and temperature correction procedure {{for use in}} Monte Carlo radiation transfer codes with sources of temperature-independent opacity, such as astrophysical dust. The technique utilizes the fact that Monte Carlo simulations track individual photon packets, so we may easily determine where their energy is absorbed. When a packet is absorbed, it heats a particular cell within the envelope, raising its temperature. To enforce radiative equilibrium, the absorbed packet is immediately re-emitted. To correct the cell temperature, {{the frequency of the}} re-emitted packet is chosen so that it corrects the temperature of the spectrum previously emitted by the cell. The re-emitted packet then continues being scattered, absorbed, and re-emitted until it finally <b>escapes</b> from the <b>envelope.</b> As the simulation runs, the envelope heats up, and the emergent spectral energy distribution (SED) relaxes to its equilibrium value, without iteration. This implies that the equilibrium temperature calculation requires no more computation time than the SED calculation of an equivalent pure scattering model with fixed temperature. In addition to avoiding iteration, our method conserves energy exactly, because all injected photon packets eventually escape. Furthermore, individual packets transport energy across the entire system because they are never destroyed. This long-range communication, coupled with the lack of iteration, implies that our method does not suffer the convergence problems commonly associated with lambda-iteration. To verify our temperature correction procedure, we compare our results to standard benchmark tests, and finally we present the results of simulations for two-dimensional axisymmetric density structures.

40|$|The HIV- 1 {{envelope}} glycoproteins gp 120 and gp 41 mediate binding and {{fusion of}} the virus to target cells. The envelope glycoproteins are exposed on the surface {{of the virus}} as trimeric spikes and are the major targets for neutralizing antibodies. The design of envelope glycoprotein-based subunit vaccines has been frustrated by many viral immune <b>escape</b> mechanisms. Trimeric <b>envelope</b> glycoprotein formulations hold promise to overcome limitations of monomeric envelope glycoproteins as immunogens. The generation of native, trimeric envelope glycoprotein complexes, however, remains a major challenge. Here, solid-phase proteoliposomes containing native, trimeric HIV- 1 envelope glycoprotein complexes that mimic the trimeric complex as it is found on the viral surface have been designed. In a comparative immunogenicity study, these proteoliposomes were shown to better elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies than gp 120. A second trimeric envelope glycoprotein formulation, soluble YU 2 gp 140 -GCN 4 constructs, were also shown to better elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies in rabbits, extending a previous study in mice. These data support the hypothesis that trimeric envelope glycoprotein formulations are an advance over gp 120 -based immunogens. To date, only four broadly neutralizing antibodies against the HIV- 1 envelope glycoproteins have been identified. Here, three novel Fab antibody fragments binding to the CD 4 binding site of gp 120 have been identified from phage-displayed antibody libraries with proteoliposomes. These Fab antibodies display some breadth and potency in neutralizing HIV- 1. Comparison of the neutralizing activity of Fab antibodies and whole antibodies directed to the CD 4 binding site suggests that these Fab antibodies may significantly gain neutralizing potency as whole antibodies. Many HIV- 1 immune escape mechanisms complicate the elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies. Core gp 120 envelope glycoproteins derived from primary isolate viruses were found to be deficient in T-helper epitopes. This finding is suggestive of yet another HIV- 1 viral immune escape mechanism, the escape from recognition by CD 4 + T-helper cells...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{minority}} of HIV- 1 infected individuals develop broad cross-neutralizing (BCN) plasma antibodies that {{are capable of}} neutralizing a spectrum of virus variants belonging to different HIV- 1 clades. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the targeted epitopes of an individual with BCN plasma antibodies, referred to as ITM 4, using peptide phage display. This study also aimed to use the selected mimotopes as tools to unravel the evolution of the antibody landscape and the viral <b>envelope</b> <b>escape</b> which may provide us with new insights for vaccine design. RESULTS: This study led us to identify ITM 4 plasma antibodies directed to the 4 E 10 epitope located in the gp 41 membrane-proximal external region (MPER). Analysis of antibody specificities revealed unusual immunogenic properties of the ITM 4 viral envelope, as not only the V 3 loop and the gp 41 MPER but also the C 1 and lentivirus lytic peptide 2 (LLP 2) region seem to be targets of the immune system. The 4 E 10 -like antibodies are consistently elicited during the 6 -year follow up period. HIV- 1 ITM 4 pseudoviruses showed an increasing resistance over time to MPER monoclonal antibodies 4 E 10 and 2 F 5, although no changes are found in the critical positions of the epitope. Neutralization of COT 6. 15 (subtype C; 4 E 10 -sensitive) pseudoviruses with alanine substitutions in the MPER region indicated an overlapping specificity of the 4 E 10 monoclonal antibody and the ITM 4 follow up plasma. Moreover the 4 E 10 -like antibodies of ITM 4 contribute to the BCN capacity of the plasma. CONCLUSIONS: Using ITM 4 BCN plasma and peptide phage display technology, we have identified a patient with 4 E 10 -like BCN antibodies. Our results indicate that the elicited 4 E 10 -like antibodies play a role in virus neutralization. The viral RNA was isolated at different time points and the ITM 4 envelope sequence analysis of both early (4 E 10 -sensitive) and late (4 E 10 -resistant) viruses suggest that other regions in the envelope, outside the MPER region, contribute to the accessibility and sensitivity of the 4 E 10 epitope. Including ITM 4 specific HIV- 1 Env properties in vaccine strategies may be a promising approach...|$|R
