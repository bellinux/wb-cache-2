40|$|This article {{seeks to}} {{describe}} and understand relational <b>interaction</b> <b>processes</b> in project networks, and {{suggests that there is}} a connection between the characteristics of a project network and the type of interactions within it. We suggest that time, legitimacy and power structure determine the type of <b>interaction</b> <b>processes</b> that occur. Four case studies of service-producing project networks show that relational <b>interaction</b> <b>processes</b> tend to change over time – shifting between the dimensions of consent and negotiation. Project networks seeking to acquire legitimacy are characterised by consent-based <b>interaction</b> <b>processes</b> such as mapping by rhetoric and maintaining an element of vagueness. Even legitimate project networks are, on the other hand, characterised by negotiation-based <b>interaction</b> <b>processes</b> such as meetings between the representatives of different interests. Thus, actors in different types of project network adopt different interaction strategies in managing project networks with a view to creating legitimacy or mutual commitment...|$|R

40|$|Different from {{previous}} research {{that focused on}} the formation phase of partnering processes in joint ventures, this study focuses on the post-formation phase and argues that partner <b>interaction</b> <b>processes</b> of communication, cooperation, and conflict resolution {{play a key role in}} the implementation and management of joint ventures. We examine how organizational culture differences (OCD) and integration acculturation strategy (IAS) affect international joint venture (IJV) performance through the mediation of partner <b>interaction</b> <b>processes.</b> We develop hypotheses and test them by survey data from 202 executives of IJVs in India. The results suggest that the <b>interaction</b> <b>processes</b> fully mediate the negative effect of OCD but partially mediate the positive effect of IAS on partners’ satisfaction with the joint venture performance. We discuss the implication of these findings for research and practice on post-formation management of IJVs...|$|R

The ability to maintain this rich tradition clashes with the gradual reduction of public funds and static demand. In this context, theatre managers have to activate, develop and manage relationships with the market that can be represented as a network of actors 1 who contribute in different ways to their artistic and economic objectives. Our work aims to analyze a) the constituent actors of the market as a network; b) the <b>interaction</b> <b>processes</b> and their relation to market representation; c) the contribution of <b>interaction</b> <b>processes</b> {{to the creation of}} outcomes (economic, artistic, social) in production theatre organizations.
