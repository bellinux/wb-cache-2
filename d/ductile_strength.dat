50|$|The brittle-ductile {{transition}} zone {{is characterized by}} a change in rock failure mode, at an approximate average depth of 10-15 km (~ 6.2-9.3 miles) in continental crust, below which rock becomes less likely to fracture and more likely to deform ductilely. The zone exists because as depth increases confining pressure increases, and brittle strength increases with confining pressure whilst <b>ductile</b> <b>strength</b> decreases with increasing temperature.

For quartz and feldspar rich rocks in continental crust this occurs at an approximate depth of 13-18 km (roughly equivalent to temperatures in the range 250-400°C). At this depth rock becomes less likely to fracture, {{and more likely to}} deform ductilely by creep. This happens because the brittle strength of a material is increased by the confining pressure, whilst the <b>ductile</b> <b>strength</b> of a material decreases with increasing temperature. The {{transition zone}} occurs at the level in the crust where the downwards increasing brittle strength equals the upwards increasing <b>ductile</b> <b>strength,</b> giving a characteristic [...] "saw-tooth" [...] crustal strength profile. This zone is, therefore, the strongest part of the crust and the depth at which many earthquakes occur. The level of the transition zone depends on both strain rate and temperature gradient, being shallower for slow deformation and/or high heat flow and deeper for fast deformation and/or low heat flow. Crustal composition will also affect the depth at which this zone occurs.|$|E

40|$|The {{properties}} of the subduction interplate domain are likely to affect not only the seismogenic potential of the subduction area but also the overall subduction process, as it influences its viability. Numerical simulations are performed to model the long-term equilibrium state of the subduction interplate when the diving lithosphere interacts with both the overriding plate and the surrounding convective mantle. The thermomechanical model combines a non-Newtonian viscous rheology and a pseudo-brittle rheology. Rock strength here depends on depth, temperature and stress, for both oceanic crust and mantle rocks. I study the evolution through time of, on one hand, the brittle-ductile transition (BDT) depth, zBDT, and, on the other hand, of the kinematic decoupling depth, zdec, simulated along the subduction interplate. The results show that both a high friction and a low <b>ductile</b> <b>strength</b> at the asthenospheric wedge tip shallow zBDT. The influence of the weak material activation energy is of second order but not negligible. zBDT becomes dependent on the <b>ductile</b> <b>strength</b> increase with depth (activation volume) if the BDT occurs at the interplate decoupling depth. Regarding the interplate decoupling depth, it is shallowed (1) significantly if mantle viscosity at asthenospheric wedge tip is low, (2) if the difference in mantle and interplate activation energy is weak, and (3) if the activation volume is increased. Very low friction coefficients and/or low asthenospheric viscosities promote zBDT = zdec. I then present how the subducting lithosphere age affects the brittle-ductile transition depth and the kinematic decoupling depth in this model. Simulations show that a rheological model in which the respective activation energies of mantle and interplate material are too close hinders the mechanical decoupling at the down-dip extent of the interplate, and eventually jams the subduction process during incipient subduction of a young (20 -Myr-old) and soft lithosphere under a thick upper plate. Finally, both the BDT depth and the decoupling depth are {{a function of the}} subducting plate age, but are not influenced in the same fashion: cool and old subducting plates deepen the BDT but shallow the interplate decoupling depth. Even if BDT and kinematic decoupling are intrinsically related to different mechanisms of deformation, this work shows that they are able to interact closely. Comparison between modelling results and observations suggests a minimum friction coefficient of 0. 045 for the interplate plane, even 0. 069 in some cases, to model realistic BDT depths. The modelled zdec is a bit deeper than suggested by geophysical observations. Eventually, the better way to improve the adjustment to observations may rely on a moderate to strong asthenosphere viscosity reduction in the metasomatised mantle wedge...|$|E

50|$|The {{physical}} characteristics of rocks {{that control the}} rate and mode of strain, such as yield strength or viscosity, depend on the thermodynamic state of the rock and composition. The most important thermodynamic variables in this case are temperature and pressure. Both of these increase with depth, so to a first approximation the mode of deformation can {{be understood in terms}} of depth. Within the upper lithosphere, brittle deformation is common because under low pressure rocks have relatively low brittle strength, {{while at the same time}} low temperature reduces the likelihood of ductile flow. After the brittle-ductile transition zone, ductile deformation becomes dominant. Elastic deformation happens when the time scale of stress is shorter than the relaxation time for the material. Seismic waves are a common example of this type of deformation.

These values are much higher than those that were predicted by tidal heating models [2], made for solely conductive ice shell. A possible explanation could appeal to tidal heating in the warm ice from a layer in active convection under the surface. In this way, in [3] an adiabatic temperature de ~ 260 K is calculated for a convective layer that is floating in an internal ocean of liquid water in Europa. With this value, from [2] we can estimate that the average contribution to heat flow, by tidal heating, de an ice layer in adiabatic conditions would be ~ 3 - 10 mW m- 2 per each kilometre of thickness, so, a convective layer should be ~ 10 km deep at least to provide as far as ~ 100 mW m- 2 (independently of dissipation in the core, tidal or radiogenic).

40|$|Plate flexure is a {{phenomenon}} that describes how the lithosphere responds to long-term (> 105 yr) geological loads. By comparing the flexure {{in the vicinity of}} ice, volcano, and sediment loads to predictions based on simple plate models it has been possible to estimate the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere, Te. In the oceans, Te is the range 2 - 50 km and is determined mainly by plate and load age. The continents, in contrast, are characterised by Te values of up to 80 km and greater. Rheological considerations based on data from experimental rock mechanics suggest that Te reflects the integrated brittle, elastic and <b>ductile</b> <b>strength</b> of the lithosphere. Te differs, therefore, from the seismogenic layer thickness, Ts, which is indicative of the depth to which anelastic deformation occurs as unstable frictional sliding. Despite differences in their time scales, Te and Ts are similar in the oceans where loading reduces the initial mechanical thickness to values that generally coincide with the thickness of the brittle layer. They differ, however, in continents, which, unlike oceans, are characterised by a multi-layer rheology. As a result, Te ≫ Ts in cratons, many convergent zones, and some rifts. Most rifts, however, are characterised by a low Te that has been variously attributed to a young thermal age of the rifted lithosphere, thinning and heating at the time of rifting, and yielding due to post-rift sediment loading. Irrespective of their origin, the Wilson cycle makes it possible for low values to be inherited by foreland basins which, in turn, helps explain why similarities between Te and Ts extend beyond rifts into other tectonic regions such as orogenic belts and, occasionally, the cratons themselves. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.

It is found that the ratio of the target strength term to hardness increases as the fracture toughness of the targets increases. The findings on penetration resistance are used together with cavity expansion theory to estimate the relative size of the craters in ceramic targets.

40|$|International audienceThe brittle to ductile {{transition}} (BDT) in rocks may strongly influence their transport properties (i. e., permeability, porosity topology [...] .) and the maximum depth and temperature where hydrothermal fluids may circulate. To examine this transition {{in the context}} of Icelandic crust, we conducted deformation experiments on a glassy basalt (GB) and a glass-free basalt (GFB) under oceanic crust conditions. Mechanical and micro-structural observations at a constant strain rate of 10 (- 5) s(- 1) and at confining pressure of 100 - 300 MPa indicate that the rocks are brittle and dilatant up to 700 - 800 degrees C. At higher temperatures and effective pressures the deformation mode becomes macroscopically ductile, i. e., deformation is distributed throughout the sample and no localized shear rupture plane develops. The presence of glass is a key component reducing the sample strength and lowering the pressure of the BDT. In the brittle field, strength is consistent with a Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion with an internal coefficient of friction of 0. 42 for both samples. In the <b>ductile</b> field, <b>strength</b> is strain rate-and temperature-dependent and both samples were characterized by the same stress exponent in the range 3 < n < 4. 2 but by very different activation energy Q(GB) = 59 +/- 15 KJ/mol and Q(GFB) = 456 +/- 4 KJ/mol. Extrapolation of these results to the Iceland oceanic crust conditions predicts a BDT at similar to 100 degrees C for a glassy basalt, whereas the BDT might occur in non-glassy basalts at deeper conditions, i. e., temperatures higher than 550 +/- 100 degrees C, in agreement with the Icelandic seismogenic zone...|$|R
30|$|Amorphous micro-steel (AMS) fibre made by cooling {{of liquid}} pig iron is flexible, light and durable to corrosion, {{then to be}} {{compatible}} with high flowable and disperable states of mixing as well as high ductile post-cracked performances to apply in fibre-reinforced cementitious composites. In the current research, AMS fibre-reinforced cementitious composites based on cement and alkali-activated ground granulated blast furnace slag mortars were newly manufactured and evaluated for the <b>strength</b> and <b>ductile</b> characteristics mainly by direct tensile and shear transfer tests in the variation in the volume of AMS fibres with two different lengths of 15.0 and 30.0  mm. As a result, {{it was found that}} 1.0 – 1.25 % fibre volume fractions were recommendable for AMS fibre-reinforced cementitious composites to maximize direct tensile <b>strength,</b> <b>ductile</b> tensile strain, and shear strength of the composites. However, a further fraction of AMS fibre lowered these mechanical characteristics. Simultaneously, it could be said that AMS fibre-reinforced cementitious composites exhibited up to about 3.7 times higher in direct tensile strength and up to 2.3 times higher in shear strength, compared to AMS fibre-free specimens.|$|R
40|$|Ductile iron samples alloyed with 2. 5 % Si, 0. 78 % Cu, 0. 421 % Mo and 0. 151 % Ni were {{austempered}} at 345 °C and 380 °C for 150 and 180 mins {{and then}} tested for wear <b>strength.</b> <b>Ductile</b> iron was {{also included in}} the study for comparison purposes. A pin-on-disc machine was employed for wear study. The investigations were carried out for a speed of 3 m/s, under the contact load of 29. 43 N with varying sliding distances ranging from 1000 m to 5000 m. The experimental outcome indicates that ADI austempered at 345 °C is more wear resistant than the one austempered at 380 °C. Also for only a sliding distance of 3000 m, both exhibited almost same wear resistance. SEM analysis indicates running sliding marks more or less parallel to one another. Spalled layers and large voids which resemble delamination were observed on worn surface of ADI 380. This indicated the occurrence of severe wear. Dark patches observed indicate oxidized surface...|$|R
