40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{competition between}} chain-stores and <b>independent</b> <b>retailers</b> in the UK retail opticians' market. We {{demonstrate that the}} pricing policy adopted by chain-stores can determine the impact their entry has on <b>independent</b> <b>retailers.</b> Crucially, in this market the chain-store retailers set an identical national price across all local markets. Our results suggest that this pricing strategy lessens the detrimental effect competition from chain-stores has on <b>independent</b> <b>retailers...</b>|$|R
40|$|So far, the {{literature}} on Internet adoption by retailers has {{paid little attention to}} spatial variables. Using data on approximately 12 � 000 <b>independent</b> <b>retailers,</b> we investigate the geographical diffusion of Internet strategies in the Netherlands. In particular, we examine to what extent Internet adoption differs among shopping centers, cities, and regions, while accounting for organizational variables. Results suggest that <b>independent</b> <b>retailers</b> at city and village centers are more likely to adopt information-only and online sales strategies than independents located at shopping centers {{at the bottom of the}} retail hierarchy. Furthermore, <b>independent</b> <b>retailers</b> in large(r) cities have a higher probability of adopting the Internet than their counterparts in small(er) cities. On the regional level, the likelihood of Internet adoption is higher for <b>independent</b> <b>retailers</b> in core regions than for independents in the periphery. Thus, geography seems to matter for Internet adoption by <b>independent</b> <b>retailers.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Faced with fierce {{competition}} from large format <b>retailers,</b> small <b>independent</b> <b>retailers</b> {{are forced to}} reconsider their strategic approach. Although this sector is mostly characterised by stagnation and decline in activity, small <b>independent</b> <b>retailers</b> should develop and emphasize their distinctive competencies {{in order to survive}} and achieve an appropriate market share. In that context, the focus must be placed on differentiation, specialization, as sociation, finding profitable market niches, personalization and building customer loyalty. The entry of large format retailers into a market has also influenced the consumer behaviour. Small retailers should examine their potentialities and identify the opportunities presented by the market. It mainly refers to customer strategies and creating a more personalized relationship with their buyers. Close contact with the customers allows them to adapt more easily and quickly to their needs in a competitive ret ail environment. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse the present situation of small <b>independent</b> <b>retailers,</b> as well as the future of this retailing format in the face of the evolving retail sector and ever-increasing competition.

40|$|Abstract Increasingly, {{manufacturers}} {{sell their}} products {{in their own}} retail stores, {{and many of these}} stores appear to be in direct competition with independent retailers; i. e., both types of retail stores are physically co-located. We analyze one way this practice affects the retail market. We find that, when <b>independent</b> <b>retailers</b> compete against company stores (instead of just against other <b>independent</b> <b>retailers),</b> they (1) charge higher prices and (2) are more willing to engage in marketing efforts on behalf of the manufacturer’s brand. Furthermore, when company stores and <b>independent</b> <b>retailers</b> compete in the same market, the company store charges higher prices and provides more marketing effort. Anecdotal data are consistent with these model predictions...|$|R
