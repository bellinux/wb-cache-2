The original <b>distribution-free</b> <b>method</b> of Kaplan-Meier is generalized to include partially censored data, i. e. observations that are censored with a certain probability. This is achieved using a composite time headway distribution model that is estimated as well. Using synthetic data, the method is validated. The method is applied using real life data collected at different two-lane rural roads in the Netherlands to establish free speed distributions and the differences between different vehicle-types. ...|$|E

The widely used method of the generalized estimating equations can be "robustified" by replacing the standardized residuals with the M-residuals.

40|$|Background and objective: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to define normal reference values and lower limits of normal (LLN) for single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLco) and DLco per unit of alveolar volume (Kco) for Chinese adults in Hong Kong. Methods: Healthy non-smoking men and women aged 18 - 80 years were recruited by random digit dialling. DLco and Kco were measured according to American Thoracic Society standards. Reference equations were obtained by multiple linear regression; LLN were derived by <b>distribution-free</b> <b>method</b> for estimation of age-related centiles. Results: Tests from 568 subjects (259 men, 309 women) were analysed. DLco declined with age in both genders, and increased with height and the interaction term of height and age in men and women, respectively. Considering Hb values did not improve the reference equations. Kco declined with age and increased with weight in both genders, while height and its interaction term with age were additional determinants in women. The reference DLco was lower than some Caucasian values, and was only explained partially by a smaller body size and alveolar volume in Chinese. The <b>distribution-free</b> <b>method</b> yielded better overall approximation to the fifth percentile compared with the traditional method of determining LLN. Conclusions: The equations for reference values and LLN of diffusing capacity derived in this study are of clinical relevance to Chinese subjects. © 2007 The Authors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|In Phase I analysis, {{data are}} used {{retrospectively}} for checking process stability and defining the incontrol state. Most Phase I control charts {{are based on}} the assumption of normally distributed observations. However, <b>distribution-free</b> <b>methods</b> appear to be ideal candidates for Phase I applications. Indeed, because little information is available, it is difficult to validate a distributional assumption in Phase I or at least at its beginning stage. In addition, as has been noted in the literature, this assumption cannot be checked before process stability is established. In this article, we propose a new distribution-free Phase I procedure for univariate observations. The suggested method, based on recursive segmentation and permutation, detects single or multiple mean and/or scale shifts.

Different landslide hazards and susceptibility mapping methods described by Mantovani et al.

40|$|Biomarker use in {{exposure}} assessment is increasingly common and consideration of related issues is of growing importance. Exposure quantification may be compromised when measurement {{is subject to}} a lower threshold. Statistical modeling of such data requires a decision regarding the handling of such readings. Various authors have considered this problem. In the context of linear regression analysis, Richardson and Ciampi proposed replacement of data below a threshold by a constant equal to the expectation for such data to yield unbiased estimates. Use of such an imputation has some limitations; distributional assumptions are required, and bias reduction in estimation of regression parameters is asymptotic, thereby presenting concerns to small studies. In this paper the authors propose <b>distribution-free</b> <b>methods</b> for managing values below detection limits and evaluate the biases that may result when exposure measurement is constrained by a lower threshold. The authors utilize an analytical approach {{as well as a}} simulation study to assess the effects of the proposed replacement method on estimates.

This simulation may use common random numbers (CRN). From these macroreplications we conclude that the usual plug-in estimator of the variance signicantly underestimates the true variance. Because macroreplications of practical simulation models are computationally expensive, we next formulate two bootstrap methods that use a single macroreplication: (i) a <b>distribution-free</b> <b>method</b> that resamples simulation replications (within the single macroreplication), and (ii) a parametric method that assumes a Gaussian distribution for the SK predictor, and estimates the (hyper) parameters of that distribution from the single macroreplication.

40|$|In this lecture {{the general}} {{statistical}} procedure and the principles underlying {{the application of}} the theory to practical problems were considered critically. After a general discussion of the theory of statistical inference and testing of hypotheses, the conditions underlying the application to practical problems were emphasized. The statician always has to find a compromise between his mathematical and his social conscience, because he hardly ever would be allowed to apply the (mathematical) theory to practical problems if he would consult this mathematical conscience only. The correct application of the theory requires for instance that only one statistical test be applied to each set of observations, whereas practice often requires that more than one (dependent) statistical test be applied to the same set of observations. It is however not justified to test hypotheses suggested by a given set of observations, {{on the basis of these}} observations themselves.

40|$|Costs {{associated}} with the evaluation of biomarkers can restrict the number of relevant biological samples to be measured. This common problem has been dealt with extensively in the epidemiologic and biostatistical literature that proposes to apply different cost-efficient procedures, including pooling and random sampling strategies. The pooling design has been widely addressed as a very efficient sampling method under certain parametric assumptions regarding data distribution. When cost is not a main factor {{in the evaluation of}} biomarkers but measurement is subject to a limit of detection, a common instrument limitation on the measurement process, the pooling design can partially overcome this instrumental limitation. In certain situations, the pooling design can provide data that is less informative than a simple random sample; however this is not always the case.
