5|$|Temnospondyls {{and other}} early {{tetrapods}} have rounded otic notches {{in the back}} of the skull that project into the cheek region. In life, the otic notch would have been covered by a membrane called the tympanum, which is seen as a disk-like area in living frogs. The tympanum is involved in hearing, and is similar to the ear drum of more advanced tetrapods. It was traditionally thought that the tympanum developed very early in tetrapod evolution as a hearing organ and progressed to form the ear drum of amniotes. Thus, temnospondyls possessed a <b>hearing</b> <b>system</b> supposedly ancestral to that of living amphibians and reptiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{tympanum}} and stapes to effectively transmit vibrations is called impedance matching. Early tetrapods like temnospondyls have thick stapes with poor impedance matching, so it is now {{thought that they were}} not used for hearing. Instead, these thick stapes may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the otic notch. Early temnospondyls, like Dendrerpeton, could not hear airborne sound but {{would have been able to}} detect vibration in the ground. Later temnospondyls like Doleserpeton had otic regions adapted to hearing. Doleserpeton has a structure in the inner ear called the perilymphatic duct, which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing. Its stapes is also a better transmitter of sound. The <b>hearing</b> <b>system</b> of Doleserpeton and related temnospondyls was able to detect airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians.|$|E

In the vision community, a sizable group of researchers use both biological and artificial systems as motivations for their research.

2500|$|These early mammals {{developed}} many traits {{which were}} to make them well-suited for a very active lifestyle. They developed four types of teeth (as opposed to the uniform teeth of the reptiles), incisors, canines, premolars and molars, which enabled them to chew and therefore process their food more thoroughly than their reptilian cousins. There {{is evidence that the}} inward-closing movement of the mandible suggests a shearing action to chew food. Their skeletons changed so that their limbs were more flexible (they became less laterally splayed, allowing for faster forward motion) and they developed a shorter ribcage and larger lungs to allow for faster respiration. The structure of their jaw bones changed, the lower jaw becoming a single bone [...] the dentary (as opposed to the seven different bones found in reptilian lower jaws).

40|$|Directivity in <b>hearing</b> aid <b>systems</b> is {{normally}} achieved {{with the use}} of multiple microphones in an array fashion that aims to enhance signal processing capabilities and performance. Despite the use of binaural information (hearing with two ears), natural <b>hearing</b> <b>systems</b> (e. g. human) also rely on movements of the head to retrieve directional information and the origin of sounds [1]. This kind of natural sensing technique, which combines sound with the movements and position of the body (Fig. 1 & 2) has previously been investigated, and showed encouraging results with improved localization performance [2]. However, the concept has not been explored or exploited yet in any standard commercial hearing aid devices.

50|$|The {{principle}} of bone conduction {{has been used}} for many years to treat patients with single-sided deafness and conductive hearing loss. The principle is based on decades of research showing that bone conduction stimulation of the teeth initiates auditory sensations. Evidence shows that teeth vibrations lead to audio-frequency vibration transmissions via soft tissue. Those transmissions then travel through skull foramina into the skull cavity. From there, they channel into the inner ear fluids, stimulating the cochlea.

40|$|In this project, {{the vision}} and <b>hearing</b> <b>systems</b> of an agile human {{symbiotic}} service robot will be designed based on computational intelligence algorithms. The detection of humans and objects is an important and indispensable preprocessing step; and the face detection and recognition are crucial functions for service providing and surveillance applications. With gesture recognition and voice control systems, robots can receive correct instructions in noisy environments. Therefore, they provide robust human machine interface. The major application areas include commercial service (e. g. reception personnel), recreations (e. g. robot caddie), home service, {{and taking care of}} elderly citizens. For the vision system, stereo images based on two cameras will be adopted so that the target detection can be more effective. In the face recognition system, the matching results from the two-dimensional template and the three-dimensional feature points are combined in order to achieve a higher recognition rate. For speech and gesture recognition, feed-forward and recurrent TS-type fuzzy classifiers based on the support vector training algorithm will be developed to improve the accuracy and reduce the computational load. The vision and the <b>hearing</b> <b>systems</b> will be integrated with the systems from other projects on a PC-based platform. 本子計畫主要以計算智慧（computational intelligence）為基礎，設計與人共生半人型機器人之視覺與聽覺系統。其中機器人視覺是機器人對環境的認知以及與人互動中很重要的一環。而人體與目標物的偵測是一重要的前處理步驟，人臉的偵測與辨識則是對於提供服務以及環境監控等應用所必須具備的基本功能。動態手勢辨識與語音控制則著重在噪音環境下的使用者控制命令辨識，可以提供適當的人機溝通介面，使機器人能正確的接受使用者的指令。其主要應用領域有商用服務（如接待與導覽）、休閒娛樂（高爾夫桿弟機器人，餐飲機器人）、居家服務機器人（家務處理，交談）以及老年照護機器人（照護保健，事件提醒）。在視覺系統方面，我們將採用雙攝影機的架構，使得目標物偵測更為有效。在人臉辨識系統中，我們將結合二維樣版與特徵點三維資訊比對的結果，以提高辨識率。在手勢與語音辨識系統中，我們將發展以支持向量所訓練的模糊分類器，來提高運算速度與準確性。最後我們將把所發展的系統與其他子計畫成果整合至以個人電腦為基礎的平台上...|$|R

40|$|Bone-conducted {{speech in}} an {{extremely}} noisy environment {{seems to be more}} advantageous than normal noisy speech (i. e., noisy air-conducted speech) because of its stability against surrounding noise. The sound quality of bone-conducted speech, however, is very low and restoring bone-conducted speech is a challenging new topic in the speech signal-processing field. We describe two types of models for restoration: one based on the modulation transfer function (MTF) and the other based on linear prediction (LP). The MTF-based model is expected to yield a restored signal with higher intelligibility while the LP-based model is expected to yield one that is not only more intelligible to human <b>hearing</b> <b>systems</b> but also enables automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems to achieve better performance. To evaluate the ability of these models to improve voice-quality, we compared them with the other previous two models using one subjective and three objective measurements. The mean opinion score (MOS) and log-spectrum distortion (LSD) were used to evaluate the improvements in intelligibility, which is useful for human <b>hearing</b> <b>systems.</b> The distances based on LP coefficients and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were used to evaluate improvements in cepstral distances which are useful for ASR systems. The results proved that both the MTF-based and LP-based models are better than the other previous models for improving intelligibility. They particularly proved that LP-based models produces the best results for both human <b>hearing</b> and ASR <b>systems...</b>|$|R
