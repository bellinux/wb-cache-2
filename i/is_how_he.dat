5|$|To begin with, {{every one}} must buy this {{book for the}} {{following}} aesthetic reasons: First, because I know where there is the cutest cloth of gold dress for only $300 in a store on Forty-second Street, and, also, if enough people buy it {{where there is a}} platinum ring with a complete circlet, and, also, if loads of people buy it my husband needs a new winter overcoat, although the one he has done well enough for the last three years... It seems to me that on one page I recognized a portion of an old diary of mine which mysteriously disappeared shortly after my marriage, and, also, scraps of letters which, though considerably edited, sound to me vaguely familiar. In fact, Mr. Fitzgerald—I believe that <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> spells his name—seems to believe that plagiarism begins at home.|$|E
5|$|After {{stopping}} one of Fat Tony's operations, Homer practically rids Springfield of crime. However, Fat Tony escapes and vows to kill Homer {{unless he}} leaves town. Homer {{is unable to}} get protection from the citizens he protects (only Ned Flanders volunteers, but Homer ignores his offer) and Lenny and Carl lock themselves in a jail cell. When Homer does not leave, Fat Tony arrives {{with a few of}} his own henchmen (including Johnny Tightlips), as well as mafia muscle—the characters of the Sopranos series. Just before they are about to kill Homer, someone shoots the mobsters and injures them. Safe again, Homer resigns as police chief and offers the job to the first person who comes along, which is Wiggum (who notes that an identical situation <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> became chief in the first place). When Marge thanks him for saving Homer, Wiggum says that he did not shoot anyone, having lost his gun, badge and nearly his squad car. Unbeknownst to them, the person who saved Homer was Maggie, who fires at the mobsters from her window with a scoped sporting rifle.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2005 Barrales {{began looking}} for musicians for the band, asking friends of his {{to see if they}} could {{recommend}} anyone, which <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> heard of guitarist Alex Lee. When Barrales saw Lee play, he dropped the thought of trying to play rhythm guitar himself because he had a fear of not being able to keep up. There were a few years that Lee was playing guitar, but he was already playing along to music by Steve Vai, John Petrucci, Rusty Cooley, Paul Gilbert and Michael Angelo Batio. Lee decided to join Barrales, and together, they went on searching until they found themselves the drummer Carlos Regalado, who was known locally by playing covers of Megadeth and Metallica. With Regalado in the band, he helped to find bassist Ruben Dominguez. The band was impressed with the skills of Dominguez, who soon joined the band completing its line-up. The band then decided to name themselves after Exodus' Bonded by Blood, an album they had in common in their collection, even though their music tastes differed.|$|E

25|$|Betts {{was the son}} of Edward Betts of Preston Hall, Aylesford, a civil {{engineering}} contractor, who married the sister of the railway entrepreneur Samuel Morton Peto, which <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> was given his name.

25|$|In 1989, Prime {{survived a}} gang-related shooting. The artist {{was shot at}} point blank range by two {{different}} assailants with two separate firearms, losing full movement {{of his right hand}} for many years. Prime responded by training himself to write and paint with his left hand, which <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> primarily paints today, although he has developed ambidextrous skills and at times switches hands.|$|E
25|$|In {{discussing}} God's {{relationship to}} His creation, Orthodox theology distinguishes between God's eternal essence, which is totally transcendent, and His uncreated energies, which <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>He</b> reaches us. The God who is transcendent and the God who touches us {{are one and}} the same. That is, these energies are not something that proceed from God or that God produces, but rather they are God himself: distinct, yet inseparable from, God's inner being.|$|E
25|$|Another early {{representation}} is in a mosaic in the Church of San Pietro in Vincoli (Rome, Italy), probably {{made in the}} year 682. It shows a grown, bearded man in court dress but contains no trace of an arrow. The archers and arrows begin to appear by 1000, and ever since have been far more commonly shown than the actual moment of his death by clubbing, {{so that there is}} a popular misperception that this <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> died.|$|E
60|$|Philip was {{restless and}} dissatisfied. Hayward's poetic allusions troubled his imagination, and his soul yearned for romance. At least that <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> {{put it to}} himself.|$|R

25|$|Durousseau {{still managed}} to hold various {{legitimate}} jobs. In 2001, he {{was hired as a}} school bus driver and an animal control worker despite being a convicted felon. In 2003, he worked as a taxi driver and it is now accepted that this <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> first came into contact with some of his victims. It was erroneously reported that Gator City Taxi Company failed to run a background check on Durousseau; the City of Jacksonville was responsible for the background check, and issued Durousseau's taxi driver permit.|$|E
25|$|When he {{was still}} in the Academy of Theatre and Film Arts Stefan Valdobrev was {{assigned}} to compose the music for almost every one of the performances he played in. This <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> gained skills directly in practice. By the end of his acting education he had already written the scores for 10 stage performances. His work garnered attention, providing him a long list of commissions to the professional scene. He then enjoyed a long period of productive years, composing the music for more than 70 theatre plays and 20 feature and documentary films, receiving many plaudits, awards and nominations.|$|E
25|$|Descartes {{explains}} how {{he made a}} mention of the two questions, the existence of God, and the soul, in his Discourse on Method. Following this, he received objections, {{and two of them}} he considers are of importance. The first <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> concludes that the essence of the soul is a thing that thinks, excluding all other nature. To this he says that he has a clear perception that he is a thinking thing, and has no other clear perception, and from this he concludes that there is nothing else in the essence of the self.|$|E

25|$|In 1809, Samuel Thomas von Soemmering {{developed}} the first telegraph. He used a device with 26 wires (1 wire for each {{letter of the}} German alphabet) terminating in a container of acid. At the sending station, a key, which completed a circuit with a battery, was connected as required {{to each of the}} line wires. The passage of current caused the acid to decompose chemically, and the message was read by observing at which of the terminals the bubbles of gas appeared. This <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> was able to send messages, one letter at a time.|$|E
25|$|On the road, Tommy's social {{anxiety and}} {{hyperactivity}} alienate numerous potential buyers. The {{lack of any}} progress leads to tension between Tommy and Richard. Additionally, the duo encounters a variety of incidents {{that lead to the}} near destruction of Richard's car. When all seems lost, Tommy persuades a surly waitress to serve him chicken wings after the kitchen closes. Richard realizes that Tommy has the ability to read people, just like his father, and suggests this <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> should sell. The two mend their friendship and start to sell effectively to numerous automotive plants, eventually putting them over the half million mark.|$|E
500|$|Here Hazlitt {{steps back}} to observe his own character, musing {{that if he}} himself were less [...] "saturnine", he might well like the comedies {{as much as the}} tragedies, or at least that <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> feels, [...] "after reading [...] parts of this play".|$|E

"The name is {{something}} I {{came up with}} when I was watching the {{of the death of}} JFK Jr. They were talking about him and his family and his mom came up, and then Aristotle came up.

And it was interesting to me, about <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>how</b> spiritual <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> just coming up in the game until he mastered his field and became who he became. So I took that name." ...|$|R

500|$|Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002, Mikal Gilmore {{commented that}} [...] "the crises [...] faced {{in the mid-1970s}} changed him", and that {{depression}} was a key factor. Depression permeated many of the songs that Harrison wrote during this period, an issue that was not helped by his continued heavy drinking and cocaine use. While viewing this mindset {{as an extension of}} the artist's [...] "unholy coping mechanisms" [...] over 1973–74, author Robert Rodriguez writes: [...] "What's interesting <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> chose to address what he'd been grappling with, musically. In the end, Extra Texture is unique within the Harrison catalog as essentially an LP-length excursion into soul [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Facing the Yankees in the 1963 World Series, Koufax beat Whitey Ford 5–2 in Game 1 {{and struck}} out 15 batters-including the first 5, {{breaking}} Carl Erskine's decade-old record of 14 (Gibson would break Koufax's record by striking out 17 Detroit Tigers in the 1968 World Series opener). After seeing Koufax's Game 1 performance, Yogi Berra said, [...] "I can see how he won 25 games. What I don't understand <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> lost five," [...] to which Maury Wills responded, [...] "He didn't. We lost them for him." [...] In Game 4, Koufax completed the Dodgers' series sweep with a 2–1 victory over Ford, clinching the Series MVP Award for his performance.|$|E
500|$|During the war, Grant {{studied the}} tactics and {{strategies}} of Scott and Taylor, later writing {{in his memoirs}} that this <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> learned about military leadership. In retrospect, he identified his leadership style with Taylor's. However, Grant also wrote that the Mexican War was wrong and the territorial gains were designed to expand slavery, stating, [...] "I was bitterly opposed to the measure...and to this day, regard the war, which resulted, {{as one of the}} most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation." [...] He opined that the Civil War was punishment on the nation for its aggression in Mexico. During the war, Grant discovered his [...] "moral courage" [...] and began to consider a career in the army.|$|E
