40|$|<b>Joint</b> <b>master</b> {{programmes}} are systems {{which by}} default demand a proper quality system {{in order to}} sustain and improve. Objective of this thesis is analysing and proposing solutions to difficulties associated {{with the implementation of}} a quality management system to <b>joint</b> <b>master</b> programmes, with the focus on international <b>joint</b> <b>master</b> programmes. The application of the analysis to the Erasmus Mundus <b>joint</b> <b>master</b> programme European Master in Quality in Analytical Laboratories (EMQAL) is discussed. QA systems implementation in HEIs in Europe is an ongoing process, and implementation of such systems in JPs is one step further to enhancing quality in higher education in Europe. The issue closely discussed in this thesis is: should QMS be developed independently from the institutions, or should the institutions, when developing their quality management systems, take into account the (future) development of joint courses and prepare their quality procedures accordingly? A quality management system is normally developed for one organization, and different aspects of cooperation are considered within. A <b>joint</b> <b>master</b> programme is a result of successful cooperation of two or more organizations; therefore a development of its quality management system must be approached in a different manner. This thesis proposes a QMS with emphasis both on the HEI and the consortium. Different processes in the QMS can be managed independently {{at the level of the}} HEI or at the level of the consortium. Most processes in <b>joint</b> <b>master</b> programmes should be designed in programmes’ and institutions’ QMSs. Quality of a <b>joint</b> <b>master</b> programme cannot be analyzed separately from the higher education institutions which are organizing it. Comparative analysis of organization of one Erasmus Mundus Master programme to the solutions proposed in discussion showed that from all of the aspects considered, processes in EMQAL are organized in harmony with the proposed delegation of processes of the QMS for a <b>joint</b> <b>master</b> programme. The solutions proposed in the discussion are based on theoretical application of the quality principles and concepts. Comparison to the quality processes and procedures in an existing EM programme showed that analysis is applicable in practice...|$|R
