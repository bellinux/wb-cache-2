Instead, the name appears to be taken from Oatlands Park in England, which was close to the lands of Lord Dundas, for whom the neighbouring suburb was named. In 1840, the land was sold to James Bettington, who used it for sheep farming. Oatlands House is now used as function centre, with the surrounding land forming the Oatlands Golf Course, which was opened in 1931. Oatlands was defined as a new suburb in 1991.

The experiment was conducted under field conditions on an Oxisol (Haplustox), clay texture, in Selvíria, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. The experimental design was a randomized block design with eight replications, two sowing seasons and five coverage treatments.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} sowing date and plant density on yield and yield components of safflower (Carthamus tinctorious) as well as evaluating {{the possibility of the}} second sowing of the plant in Torbat Heidariyeh, a field experiment was conducted in Rokh, Cold Season Cereal Research Station 2005. The experiment was conducted in split plot arrangement in complete randomized block design with four replications. Main plots were sowing date in five levels including 9 April, 10 May, 31 May, 20 June, 11 July and sub plots were plant density in three levels including 300000, 400000, 500000 plants per hectar. Some charactristics such as the number of capitulum per square meter, seed number in capitulum, seed weight, harvest index and seed yeild was evaluated. The highest seed yield was obtained in <b>first</b> <b>sowing</b> date in 3347 kg/ha and a delay in sowing date resulted a decrease in yield. The cold weather in (05 / 11 / 2005) caused flower fertility not accured, consequently, sowing was not successful. Results showed that the effect of sowing date on yield depends on the number of capitulum per unit area and the number of grains per capitulum. These two characteristics in th <b>first</b> <b>sowing</b> date in respect of the other dates were higher. The effect of density on yield was significant resulted on yield increase due to capitulum increase in unit area.

40|$|The present {{research}} {{was done to}} assess the best selection criteria for yield improvement in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) using stepwise regression and principal component analyses at different sowing dates. All the traits except 1000 -seed weight were significantly affected by sowing dates. The results of stepwise regression analysis revealed that seeds per pod had an important role at {{the first and second}} sowing dates, but at the third and fourth sowing dates, pods per plant and days to flowering were more important than other yield components for a seed yield prediction model. On the basis of a cumulative percent of variation, three principal components (PCs) were determined for each sowing date. The cumulative percentages of variation for three PCs at the first to fourth sowing dates were 0. 97, 0. 96, 0. 89 and 0. 95, respectively. At the <b>first</b> <b>sowing</b> date, the first principal component (PC 1) had high positive and negative PC loading values for the studied traits such as days to flowering, days to the end of flowering, duration of flowering, pods per plant and harvest index. Therefore, there was high variation in these traits among the genotypes. PC 2 of the <b>first</b> <b>sowing</b> date had also high PC loadings for pods on the main raceme, seeds per pod, 1000 -seed weight, biological and seed yields, therefore the correlation of these traits with this PC will be high. In PC 3 of the <b>first</b> <b>sowing</b> date, height, pods on the main raceme and pods per plant had the high value of PC loadings. Based on stepwise regression analysis, seeds per pod at the first and second sowing dates and days to flowering and pods per plant at the third and fourth sowing dates had an important role for improving seed yield...|$|E

40|$|Results {{of a trial}} {{carried out}} on {{sunflower}} in order to evaluate the most appropriate sowing date and irrigation regime for a more efficient water use are reported. Sunflower was sown in 1995 - 1996 at the usual date (end of April) and in advance (end of March). It was subjected to three irrigation regimes: full restoration of consumptive water use, supplementary irrigation at the bud stage and flowering and unirrigated control. During the growing cy-cle, the following parameters were measured: water use, the main climatic data that can affect growth and evapo-transpiration, yield and its components. Despite the lower vapor pressure deficit of the air during the cropping cy-cle of the <b>first</b> <b>sowing</b> date caused {{a reduction in the}} average daily evapotranspiration, the colder temperature regime of this period, by making longer the growing cycle, caused almost the same total water use respect to the usual sow-ing dates. However, with early sowing, the crop could benefit from the spring rainfall at the initial stages of its cy-cle that reduced the seasonal irrigation volume, in the case of full irrigation and made available a greater amount of water in the case of unirrigated treatment or with supplementary irrigation. The greater water availability in the stressed treatments also produced higher grain yield in early sowing, so that an interesting interaction between the sowing date and the irrigation regime in terms of water use efficiency was observed. In fact, a significant higher ir-rigation yield water use efficiency and an interesting yield response was measured in the treatment with supple-mentary irrigation of the <b>first</b> <b>sowing</b> date.

Field trials during 1999 were made in order to study establishment, growth and yield of barley on three different kinds of day soils (16 % day, 30 % day and 36 % day respectively) in Uppsala. The Packomat Seeder was used for sowing at three different occasions. The <b>first</b> <b>sowing</b> time was on the 9 th of April, the second on the 21 st of April and the third was on the 3 rd of May. At the 3 rd of May sowing was also done in a conventional way. Half of the plots sown with the Packomat Seeder in April were rolled after sowing. When the crop was established the number of seedlings per square meter was counted. There were significant differences between the plots sown in a conventional manner and the plots sown with the Packomat Seeder. The bulk density was also measured to show differences due to sowing method and the effect of rolling. The result showed that the effect of rolling on the bulk density was significant in two out of three trials. Later on in the season the number of ears per square meter was counted in all experimental plots. The highest number of side shoots was found in the experimental treatment with the earliest sowing time with the Packomat Seeder. Finally the yield from the experimental plots was measured. The all over highest yield was registered in the trial with 16 % day content in the treatment with the earliest sowing time with the Packomat Seeder in combination with rolling.
