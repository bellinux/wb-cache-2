The direct aerosol {{effect is a}} fundamental aspect of every climate and chemical transport model. Aerosol optical properties are incorporated into the Global Environmental Multiscale model with Atmospheric Chemistry (GEM-AC) which is equipped with the M 7 aerosol submodel. With the recent progress in atmospheric and chemical transport modelling, an interactive dust emission scheme and a sea-state <b>dependent</b> <b>sea</b> salt emission scheme are also implemented in GEM-AC. An option between volume fraction mixing and Bruggeman mixing for the mixing state of soluble aerosols is provided. In addition, there is an option to include the aerosol direct effect at all nine longwave spectral bands in GEM-AC. Eight experiments are performed to document the new direct effect of the M 7 aerosols and the effects of:the aerosols in all nine longwave spectral bands, the soluble aerosol mixing state options, the interactive dust scheme, and the sea-state <b>dependent</b> <b>sea</b> salt emission scheme. Aerosol optical properties are compared against three AERONET observation sites. Implementation of the aerosol direct effect and the new aerosol options in GEM-AC maintain the model as a practical tool for climate and chemical transport modelling...|$|E
40|$|Sea level rise due {{to global}} warming is {{predicted}} to have a large impact on human society, especially for populations living in coastal regions and on islands. It is therefore of great importance to monitor the sea level and to increase {{the understanding of the}} local hydrodynamic and meteorological responses to a global sea level rise. The focus of this thesis is to estimate the local sea level using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals reflected off the sea surface. These signals were recorded in two different ways using a GNSS tide gauge at the Onsala Space Observatory, consisting of standard geodetic-type commercially off-the-shelf GNSS equipment. First, the phase-delay of the reflected GNSS signals were recorded directly with a receiver connected to a nadir-looking antenna. Together with the phase-delay of the direct signals, recorded with a receiver connected to a zenith-looking antenna, standard geodetic analysis provided GNSS sea level observations. Second, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) recorded with the receiver connected to the zenith-looking antenna, provided an indirect measurement of the reflected GNSS signals, as the reflected signals interfered with the direct GNSS signals and affected the recorded observables. From analysis of the multipath oscillations, an additional type of sea level observation was possible. Furthermore, the SNR-analysis method allowed other GNSS stations, located close to the ocean, {{in different parts of the}} world to become GNSS tide gauges. The GNSS-derived sea level from the GNSS tide gauge at the observatory was compared with independent observations of sea level from co-located traditional tide gauges, showing a high level of agreement with correlation coefficients of 0. 89 - 0. 99. The sea level results from the phase-delay analysis performed better with respect to the traditional sea level records than the results from the SNR-analysis. As an example, the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) differences from 1 month of observations between the GNSS-derived sea level (using frequency band L 1) and the sea level from the co-located tide gauge were 3. 2 - 3. 5 cm and 4. 0 - 4. 7 cm for the phase-delay analysis and the SNR-analysis, respectively. Sea level results applying the SNR-analysis for data of 5 different GNSS stations around the world were compared to independent co-located traditional tide gauge records. The results showed RMS differences on the order of 6. 2 cm for stations with low tidal ranges (up to 165 cm) and 43 cm for stations with high tidal ranges (up to 772 cm). In this case, an extended SNR-analysis approach was applied, modelling a time <b>dependent</b> <b>sea</b> level. </p...|$|E
40|$|We present {{sea level}} {{observations}} {{derived from the}} analysis of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data recorded by five coastal GPS stations. These stations are located in different regions around the world, both in the northern and in the southern hemisphere, in different multipath environments, from rural coastal areas to busy harbors, and experience different tidal ranges. The recorded SNR data show periodic variations that originate from multipath, i. e. the interference of direct and reflected signals. The general assumption is that for satellite arcs facing the open sea, the rapid SNR variations are due to reflections off the sea surface. The SNR data recorded from these azimuth intervals were analyzed by spectral analysis with two methods: a standard analysis method assuming a static sea level during a satellite arc and an extended analysis method assuming a time <b>dependent</b> <b>sea</b> level during a satellite arc. The GPS-derived sea level results are compared to sea level records from co-located traditional tide gauges, both in the time and in the frequency domain. The sea level time series are highly correlated with correlation coefficients {{to the order of}} 0. 89 – 0. 99. The root-mean-square (RMS) difference is 6. 2 cm for the station with the lowest tidal range of 165 cm and 43 cm for the station with the highest tidal range of 772 cm. The relative accuracy, defined as the ratio of RMS and tidal range, is between 2. 4 % and 10. 0 % for all stations. Comparing the standard analysis method and the extended analysis method, the results based on the extended analysis method agree better with the independent tide gauge records for the stations with a high tidal range. For the station with the highest tidal range (772 cm), the RMS is reduced by 47 % when using the extended analysis method. Furthermore, the results also indicate that the standard analysis method, assuming a static sea level, can be used for stations with a tidal range of up to about 270 cm, without performing significantly worse than the extended analysis method. Tidal amplitudes and phases are derived by harmonic analysis of the sea level records. Again, a high level of agreement is observed between the tide gauge and the GPS-derived results. Comparing the GPS-derived results, the results based on the extended analysis method show a higher degree of agreement with the traditional tide gauge results for stations with larger tidal ranges. Spectral analysis of the residuals after the harmonic analysis reveals remaining signal power at multiples of the draconitic day. This indicates that the observed SNR data are to some level disturbed by additional multipath signals, in particular for GPS stations that are located in harbors. </p...|$|E

40|$|The study about wave-current {{interaction}} is usually carried {{out through the}} use of coupled systems that consider the interaction processes in one way (waves modified by currents). During the PROMISE project, a two-way coupled model was tested and disseminated for the North Sea shelf region. The applicability of such a study was restricted to offshore areas as the used spatial resolution was relatively coarse. In this study, the implementation of an improved version of that system was used in order to reach the coastal area by means of successive nested grids. Attention is focussed on the effect of using a high resolution {{for the study of the}} wave evolution in coastal areas, specifically the Belgian coastal area. A systematic approach is used to take the original coupling system to coastal areas. First, the performance of the coupled system in an ideal basin, whose dimensions resemble the North Sea basin, was assessed. Results of this experiment indicate that tides and surges induce oscillations of Hs and Tm 02 by 5 % and 15 %, respectively, with respect to the typical values computed from an uncoupled version. The modulations of Hs depend on the depth (they increase in shallower areas), while the TM 02 oscillations are more dependent on the sea state and the current field. The spectral shape is also modified. lt was observed that considering a wave <b>dependent</b> <b>sea</b> surface stress in the hydrodynamic model under variable wind conditions increases the computed surge effect. Then, after the implementation of a nesting procedure to the hydrodynamic model, the coupled system was applied to the North Sea region. During the analysis period, an underestimation of wave parameters and surge effect was observed, mainly as a result of the misrepresentation of the wind field. The effect of coupling on Hs and TM 02 is about 3 % and more than 20 %, respectively. The nesting procedure (which is equivalent to increase the spatial resolution of the simulation) tends to improve the qualitative agreement between computed wave parameters and measurements. The same trend is observed for the computed surge effect. Spectral characteristics, like directional spreading and energy distribution, are also improved when nesting is included. In the fine grid, which covers the Belgian coastal area, the radiation stress effect was quantified and was found to be as important as considering the effect of a wave dependent surface stress in the fully coupled system. The order of magnitude of the residual current (with respect the uncoupled version) produced by this latter effect is about 10 cm/s. Concerning the specification of an open boundary conditions in the grid that covers the Belgian coastal region, it is found that the wave evolution in this area is more dependent on the consideration of the coupling between waves and hydrodynamics than on the source of boundary conditions (i. e., either obtained from a coupled or an uncoupled coarser model). Finally, the effect of considering a high spatial and spectral resolution in the wave evolution is studied. This experiment was assessed for the Belgian coastal area implementation. Comparison between measured and computed time series of Hs and TM 02 at two stations indicate that the use of a higher spatial resolution is important to account for the right energy dissipation rate. The spectral energy distribution and directional spreading is clearly improved when a higher spatial resolution is included. Also important is to consider the coupling effect on the spatial distribution of the energy. Difference maps of Hs indicate that the time varying watercolumn induces changes in the order of 10 % compared to the Hs computed from the uncoupled implementation. Most of these variations are found at the sand banks region, and the sign of the differences depend on the phase of the elevation field. The use of a high directional resolution has a comparable effect as considering the coupling. Again, the main effect is observed at the sand banks and at the entrance of the Scheldt river when waves and currents are collinear. The Hs differences pattern is dependent on the wave regime and almost independent on the phase of the hydrodynamic fields...|$|E

40|$|Most marine teleosts have a pelagic phase {{during their}} early life history, but {{few studies have}} {{investigated}} how the timing of events within the planktonic larval fish assemblage is related to environmental variability. We examined this issue using a data series of 534 larval fish samples collected between 1975 and 1987 in the Western English Channel, near Plymouth, UK. Two sets of species were identified: spring spawning (April to July) and summer spawning (July to September). The timing of appearance of the spring-spawning group in the plankton was significantly <b>dependent</b> on <b>sea</b> temperatures the previous November and December, with earlier appearance during cooler years. We suggest {{that this could be}} due to colder years triggering earlier winter migration of adults from cool inshore habitat to warmer offshore overwintering grounds, which in turn results in earlier gonad maturation and spawning. In contrast, the timing of appearance of the summer-spawning group was significantly <b>dependent</b> on <b>sea</b> temperatures the preceding March, with earlier spawning during warmer years. This may be due exclusively to more rapid gonad maturation in offshore waters. These data emphasize that marine fish populations do not always respond uniformly to temperature change. Moreover, since appropriate timing of larval fish appearance in the plankton may be critical for the match or mismatch with essential trophic resources, the thermally induced phenological changes identified have potential to influence annual recruitment success...|$|R
