5|$|The Tennessee Volunteers {{entered the}} 2009 season {{following}} a 2008 campaign {{that ended with}} a bowl-ineligible 5-7 record. After the 2008 season ended, Tennessee fired head coach Phillip Fulmer and replaced him with Lane Kiffin, who promised to turn the program around. Kiffin made an offseason splash by breaking the social norms among SEC head football coaches and violating a handful of NCAA rules. In a season-opening win over Western Kentucky, Kiffin appeared to <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> for Tennessee, as the Volunteers had their largest margin of victory in nine years.|$|E

25|$|Scott {{did take}} the Norwegian pilot and skier Tryggve Gran to the Antarctic on the {{recommendation}} of Nansen to train his expedition to ski, but although a few of his party began to learn, he made no arrangements for compulsory training for the full party.

25|$|A JAG Manual {{investigation}} commenced {{immediately after}} the fire, in accordance with Navy policy. The investigation determined that the initial explosion was caused by overheating of the Zuni rocket by the huffer exhaust. Investigators also determined that although concerns about the exhaust and placement of the huffer were raised by an airman who observed the exhaust, the personnel to whom the concerns were raised were involved in other tasks, and may not have completely understood {{what was being said}} due to the ambient noise on the flight deck; however, the investigators also noted that moving the unit may not <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in whether the initial explosion occurred or not, due to the estimated temperature of the rocket by that time. The investigation also revealed that flight-deck personnel did not have an understanding of ordnance cook-off times, and as a result may not have had an appreciation of the hazards posed by live ordnance on the flight deck. Among the items deemed to have had some sort of impact of firefighting operations were lack of redundancies in communication systems and firefighting system controls and components; lack of communication between the Air Boss, who was responsible for flight and hangar deck firefighting, and the Damage Control Assistant, who was responsible for all other firefighting operations; and overtasking of the fire-main system due to activation of multiple systems at once.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of the appeal, rumours {{surfaced}} that Miller {{was having an affair with}} one of her players. While the allegations were unfounded, their timing resulted in James being falsely accused of being their source. Hockey Canada officials determined that the rumours were started by a third party attempting to create controversy. They also rejected James' appeal, ending her Olympic dream. Neither her teammates nor her opponents could understand how she was left off the team. Canada and the United States met in the final, as expected, but it was the Americans who emerged victorious. [...] Having already defeated Canada 7–4 in the preliminary round, the Americans won the gold medal with a 3–1 victory. Former teammates argued that James could <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> for Canada had she been included.|$|E
500|$|This failure {{had three}} sources. First, {{there were the}} {{political}} constraints imposed by Washington that limited the entire American effort in Southeast Asia (the continued fiction of Laotian and Cambodian [...] "neutrality", failure to disrupt the trail with U.S. ground forces when it would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference,</b> etc.) The second source of the failure was the utilization of what Colonel Charles Morrison has called [...] "over-sophisticated methods" [...] against [...] "elemental systems." [...] The primitive logistical needs of the North Vietnamese (at least until {{the final phase of}} the conflict) allowed them to slip under the radar of their more technologically sophisticated enemy. Finally, all of the above were exacerbated by the communist's enviable ability to adapt their doctrine and tactics and to turn weaknesses into strengths.|$|E
500|$|Luis Moreno Ocampo, who was {{featured}} in the film and was, at the time, the chief Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC), voiced his support of the film and the campaign that had [...] "mobilised the world", {{and said that the}} criticism was [...] "stupid". The Special Representative and head of the newly created United Nations Regional Office for Central Africa (UNOCA), Abou Moussa, said that international interest in Kony was [...] "useful, very important". The White House released a statement of support through Press Secretary Jay Carney, who stated in a news conference, [...] "We congratulate {{the hundreds of thousands of}} Americans who have mobilized to this unique crisis of conscience" [...] and said that the raised awareness from the video is [...] "consistent with the bipartisan legislation passed by our congress in 2010." [...] Cameron Hudson, policy director at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and former Africa director in the National Security Council, also praised Invisible Children for reaching [...] "tens of millions of people who probably never previously heard of Joseph Kony." [...] Anthony Lake, the executive director of UNICEF, was cited as saying that a similar viral video would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> during the Rwandan Genocide in 1994, also suggesting that [...] "this kind of public attention would also have helped save more lives in Darfur and in Congo’s warring east." ...|$|E

Although a cure has now been discovered, he is kept frozen by Homer because it is cheaper than paying for a nursing home and because Grampa has constantly been rude to him. Homer says to the boys that they should give their father another chance, since he knows Bart loves them. At that point, Bart arrives and apologizes to his sons, admitting how much he treasures them. Touched, the two boys forgive him for not having included them [...] in his life much, while an inspired Homer decides to unfreeze Grampa and forgive him as well.

500|$|Another deleted scene {{involved}} Bruce {{waking up}} after being {{shot in the}} head by Two-Face, temporarily forgetting his origin and life as the Dark Knight. Alfred takes him to the Batcave, which has been destroyed by the Riddler. They stand on the platform where the Batmobile was, and Alfred says, [...] "Funny they did not know about the cave beneath the cave." [...] The platform then rotates downward to another level where the sonar-modification equipment is kept, from the special Batsuit to the hi-tech weaponry. Bruce then discovers the cavern where he first saw the giant bat that inspired him to become Batman. Inside he finds his father's red diary which he had dropped when he first fell into the Batcave after his parents death. He reads the entry about him insisting his parents take him to the theater to see a show the same night they were killed. He realizes he had misread it, and his father had written 'even though Bruce insists, we wanted to see Zorro so his show will have to wait until next week'. Bruce realizes his parents death was not his fault after all. The giant bat then appears and Bruce raises his arms to match the wing anatomy of the bat and the shot shows that they are one. Bruce now remembers who he is and goes with Alfred to solve the riddles left throughout the film. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman admitted the scene was very theatrical on the special edition DVD and felt it would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> to the final cut. The bat was designed and created by Rick Baker, {{who was in charge of}} the make-up of Two-Face. This scene appears in a rough form on the special edition DVD and is briefly mentioned in the comic adaptation.|$|E
