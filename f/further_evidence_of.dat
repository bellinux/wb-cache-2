An effort is made to understand the transport mechanism in InMnP using the theoretical models. We find that the valence band of InP does not merge with the impurity band of the heavily doped ferromagnetic InMnP.

40|$|We analyse {{the recent}} hints of Lepton Flavor Universality {{violations}} in semi-leptonic B decays within a general EFT {{based on a}} U(2) ^n flavor symmetry acting on the light generations of SM fermions. We analyse in particular the consistency of these anomalies with the tight constraints on various low-energy observables in B and τ physics. We show that, with a moderate fine-tuning, a consistent picture for all low-energy observables can be obtained under the additional dynamical assumption that the NP sector is coupled preferentially to third generation SM fermions. We discuss how this dynamical assumption can be implemented in general terms within the EFT, and we identify a series of observables in τ decays which could provide <b>further</b> <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> this NP framework.
