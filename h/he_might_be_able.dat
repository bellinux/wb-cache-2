5|$|During {{his rise}} to power, Richard Nixon {{became known as}} a leading anti-communist. After he became {{president}} in 1969, Nixon saw advantages in improving relations with China and the Soviet Union; he hoped that détente would {{put pressure on the}} North Vietnamese to end the Vietnam War, and <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to manipulate the two main communist powers to the benefit of the United States.|$|E

Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, {{which will be the}} number of particles in it.|$|E
5|$|On 23 March 2013, BBC {{released}} a short prequel video to the episode, written by Steven Moffat. In the prequel, the Doctor {{is sitting at}} the swings of a children's playground when he meets a little girl. They talk about losing things, and the Doctor states that he has lost someone twice and he hopes <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to find her again. The girl tells him that, when she loses something, she goes to a quiet place for a think, and then can remember where she put it. As the girl leaves, it is revealed that she is Clara Oswald.|$|E

50|$|The film {{contends that}} Binney's work was thwarted by high {{officials}} of the agency, and that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to prevent the attacks. The film was produced, directed and written by Friedrich Moser.|$|R
5|$|Eddy {{believed}} that with military {{assistance from the}} Thirteen Colonies, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> {{to bring down the}} strongly Loyalist administration of Nova Scotia. Early in 1776, Eddy went to Massachusetts in an attempt to interest political and military leaders there in supporting action in Nova Scotia, while Allan worked to raise interest in Nova Scotia. Allan's work was made more difficult by the arrival of Colonel Goreham and his troops to refortify Fort Cumberland, and by the activities of Michael Francklin, a former Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia and a vocal Loyalist. Eddy returned empty-handed to Nova Scotia in June 1776, only to learn that Goreham had put a price on his head. The activities of Goreham's Fencibles in the Cumberland area were successful enough that Patriot activities there were effectively forced underground; the center of these activities was shifted to Maugerville in part as a consequence of this. Goreham, a veteran of the French and Indian War, was also able to blunt Patriot inroads in the native communities, where the Mi'kmaq refused to take sides, and the Maliseet and Passamaquoddy, at first supportive of the Patriots, ultimately did not turn out in the numbers Eddy had hoped for or been promised.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} the marathon, all the {{entrants}} of {{the race}} except for the Finns, whose positions were known, filed a petition asking Nurmi's entry to be accepted. Edström's right-hand man Bo Ekelund, secretary general of the IAAF and head of the Swedish Athletics Federation, approached the Finnish officials and stated that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to arrange for Nurmi to participate in the marathon outside the competition. However, Finland maintained {{that as long as the}} athlete is not declared a professional, he must have the right to participate in the race officially. Although he had been diagnosed with a pulled Achilles tendon two weeks earlier, Nurmi stated he would have won the event by five minutes. The congress concluded without Nurmi being declared a professional, but the council's authority to disbar an athlete was upheld on a 13–12 vote. However, due to the close vote, the matter was postponed until the 1934 meet in Stockholm. Finns charged that the Swedish officials had used devious tricks in their campaign against Nurmi's amateur status, and ceased all athletic relations with Sweden. A year earlier, controversies on the track and in the press had led Finland to withdraw from the Finland-Sweden athletics international. After Nurmi's suspension, Finland did not agree to return to the event until 1939.|$|E
25|$|Westinghouse {{remained}} {{productive and}} inventive almost all his life. Like Edison, {{he had a}} practical and experimental streak. At one time, Westinghouse began to work on heat pumps that could provide heating and cooling, and believed that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to extract enough power in the process for the system to run itself.|$|E

6000|$|The {{thought was}} checked abruptly, for he {{suddenly}} {{remembered that he}} had a burning-glass in his trousers pocket. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> perhaps <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to roast them with that--in a somewhat underdone fashion, no doubt--still, any sort of cooking would be better than none! ...|$|R

25|$|In December, Yardy was {{excluded}} from the England squad for the Commonwealth Bank one-day series in Australia following a disappointing ICC Champions Trophy performance in India. There was a consolation for the all-rounder early in 2007, however, as he was named captain of the England A squad to tour Bangladesh, indicating that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to revive his England career. On 22 June 2007, Yardy was selected in the 14-man ODI and Twenty20 squad for England against the West Indies.|$|E

25|$|A young singer, Tommy Sands, caught Parker's eye in 1952, and Parker {{immediately}} {{set about}} promoting him. He arranged live appearances and became {{something of a}} father figure to the then-15-year-old Sands. Parker had intended to mold Sands into the next Roy Rogers, but Sands {{had no interest in}} such a plan. Instead, Parker sent demonstration recordings to Steve Sholes at RCA. Scholes showed little interest in Sands, but promised that he would attempt to find songs <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to record.|$|E
25|$|On 13 March 1815, {{six days}} before Napoleon reached Paris, the powers at the Congress of Vienna {{declared}} him an outlaw; four days later, the United Kingdom, Russia, Austria, and Prussia bound themselves to put 150,000 men each {{into the field}} to end his rule. Napoleon knew that, once his attempts at dissuading {{one or more of}} the Seventh Coalition Allies from invading France had failed, his only chance of remaining in power was to attack before the Coalition could put together an overwhelming force. If he could destroy the existing Coalition forces south of Brussels before they were reinforced, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to drive the British back to the sea and knock the Prussians out of the war.|$|E
25|$|Rivers {{had already}} formed {{a career in}} {{physiology}} and psychology. But now he moved more definitively into anthropology. He wanted a demographically small, fairly isolated people, comparable to the island societies of the Torres Strait, where <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to get genealogical data on each and every individual. The Todas in the Nilgiri Hills of Southern India, with their population then about 700 plus, suited Rivers’s criteria. And they had speciﬁc features of social organization, such as polyandrous marriage and a bifurcation of their society into so-called moieties that had interested historical evolutionists. Whether his fieldwork was initially so single-minded is questionable, however, since at first he looked at other local communities and studied their visual perception before fixing all his attention on the Todas.|$|E

25|$|Hood {{began to}} focus his strategy. He needed to prevent Thomas's army from reuniting with Sherman and {{overwhelming}} him, and he calculated that if he moved swiftly into Tennessee, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to defeat Thomas before the Union forces could be reassembled. After Thomas was eliminated, Hood planned to move into central Kentucky and replenish his army with recruits from there and Tennessee. He hoped to accomplish all of this before Sherman could reach him. His plan was that if Sherman followed him, Hood would fight him in Kentucky; from there he planned to move eastward through the Cumberland Gap to aid Robert E. Lee, who was besieged at Petersburg. On October 21, Hood's plan received the reluctant approval of Gen. Beauregard, who {{was concerned about the}} daunting logistical challenges of an invasion. Beauregard insisted that Wheeler's cavalry be detached to monitor Sherman, and assigned Nathan Bedford Forrest's cavalry to Hood's advance. Hood set out toward Decatur, Alabama, with the intention of meeting up with Forrest in the vicinity of Florence, from where they would march north into Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|Haiti was {{the first}} {{government}} of an independent state that recognised the revolution. Jean-Pierre Boyer, President of Haiti, following a Greek request for assistance, addressed a letter on 15 January 1822. In the letter sent to Greek expatriates living in France, Adamantios Korais, Christodoulos Klonaris, Christodoulos Klonaris, Konstantinos Polychroniades and A. Bogorides, who had assembled themselves into a Committee which was seeking international support for the ongoing Greek revolution, expressed {{his support for the}} Greek Revolution and compared the struggle underfoot across the Atlantic to the struggle for independence in his own land. He apologized for being unable to support the Revolution in Greece financially, though he hoped <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to in the future. But he articulated his moral and political support for the revolution, notably by filling his letter with references to classical Greek history, demonstrating a detailed knowledge of this history and powerfully evoking the contemporary revolutionaries as the rightful heirs of their ancestors. Some historians claim that Boyer also sent to the Greeks 25 tons of Haitian coffee that could be sold and the proceeds used to purchase weapons, but not enough evidence exists to support this or the other claim that one hundred Haitian volunteers set off to fight in the Greek Revolution. Allegedly, their ship was boarded by pirates somewhere in the Mediterranean and these fighters purportedly never reached their destination.|$|E

500|$|The {{capture of}} Thessalonica, {{traditionally}} the second {{city of the}} Byzantine Empire after Constantinople, was a major stroke against the Latins and greatly boosted Theodore's standing, {{so much that he}} now regarded himself as superior to Vatatzes, and openly claimed the Byzantine imperial title by putting on the purple boots reserved to the emperor. Indeed, one of his major supporters, the eminent Metropolitan of Naupaktos, John Apokaukos, {{in a letter to the}} Patriarch in 1222 declared that the Epirotes already regarded Theodore as their [...] "God-sent regent and emperor", and later wrote to Theodore's wife expressing the hope that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to assist at their imperial coronation at Thessalonica.|$|E
