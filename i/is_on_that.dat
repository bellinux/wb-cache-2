25|$|On 2 September, Pomone caught Rude, of 12 guns, in Bourneaux Bay {{and burnt}} her. However, there are {{discrepancies}} between the British and French records. French {{records show that}} the crew of Rude, of three guns (not 12), and {{under the command of}} enseigne do vaisseau non entretenu Cheneau, ran her aground on Noirmoutier on 25 September to block the British from capturing her. The records do agree on the approximate location: Bourneaux Bay was a British name for Bourgneuf Bay, and Noirmoutier <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> bay.|$|E

The {{second half of}} the season builds on the complications of Serena's new found relationship with her former teacher Colin, Chuck trying to regain control of Bass Industries from Russell Thorpe (Michael Boatman), and Dan and Blair's growing friendship.

By the end of the season, Blair has ignored Chuck, Dan has told Vanessa they are no longer friends, and Serena <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> single grind.|$|E
25|$|So there’s no real choice this year, {{but what}} the Occupy {{movement}} has done has taken {{us back to the}} era when Martin Luther King was in the Sixties said ‘This is unacceptable!’ We cannot have a situation where everything is owned by the 1% {{in the same way that}} Martin Luther King said in the Riverside Church that we have a government that is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today, we are exploiting the planet, and that is unacceptable. So the memory of Martin Luther King – it’s about dreams, but it’s also about the courage to draw a line right there and say ‘We cannot go on crossing this line. This is a moral line, this is a line concerning power and the world’. And there today America <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> line. And people know that what we got to – these years after Martin Luther King was murdered – is completely unacceptable, and it’s his example that will inspire us as we go forward into this year.|$|E

500|$|During {{the late}} 20th century {{there was a}} gradual [...] "retreat" [...] from this rule; in Sagnata Investments Ltd v Norwich Corporation, the courts allowed Hansard {{material}} to be submitted to determine the purpose of legislation (but not to interpret the statute), and in Pickstone v Freemans plc, it was allowed {{to assist in the}} understanding of delegated legislation. A noted attack on the rule was made by Lord Denning in Davis v Johnson, where he said that asserting that the courts could not use Hansard was similar to saying that the judges [...] "should grope about in the dark for the meaning of an Act without switching on the light. In some cases Parliament is assured in the most explicit terms what the effect of a statute will be. It <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> footing that members assent to the clause being agreed to. It <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> understanding that an amendment is not pressed. In such cases I think the court should {{be able to look at}} the proceedings." [...] Despite these exceptions, the courts regularly maintained that it was not possible to use internal Parliamentary discussions as an aid to legislative interpretation. The result of Pepper was a reversal of that rule; a court could use internal Parliamentary discussions where it was relevant to [...] "the very point in question in the litigation", where a piece of legislation is [...] "ambiguous or obscure, or the literal meaning of which leads to an absurdity", with the intention being to understand [...] "the mischief aimed at or the legislative intention lying behind the ambiguous or obscure words".|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} listed {{as one of the}} best songs of the year by several publications. The New York Times placed the song amongst the best tracks of 2011. Ology's JT Langley placed the song amongst the best of the year, writing [...] "Frank makes a foul mouth sound sweeter than your usual R through his brand of crooning, and Tricky Stewart's {{production}} adds yet another morose element to provide the more macabre side of the drugs-for-love-lost genre." [...] Pitchfork named the song the 41st best song of the year, musing that [...] "he might be fronting like the Drakes and post-"808s" [...] Kanyes of the world, but there's too much self-effacement happening for Ocean not to realize the inherent humor in his own drama. If Ocean really <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> visionary Kubrick shit like he claims, then [...] "Novacane" [...] could very well be his Dr. Strangelove. Zimbio placed the song at number 2 on their best hip-hop songs of the year list, writing [...] "while every track on his mixtape, nostalgia, Ultra, warrants a listen, it's the radio-friendly [...] "Novacane" [...] that stands out as his most mature and enjoyable song to date." [...] Spin named the song the fifth best of the year, describing the track as [...] "a fully evolved Drake song, where you're slyly immersed in youthful, aww-shit decadence, while simultaneously watching your dreams of recreational stripper booty and complimentary cocaine breakfasts get methodically dismantled." ...|$|E

For example, when Austrian-born neurobiologist Eric Kandel won the Nobel Prize in 2000, he [...] "stuck it to the Austrians" [...] by saying it was certainly not an Austrian Nobel, it was a Jewish-American Nobel. After that, he got a call from then Austrian president Thomas Klestil asking him, [...] "How can we make things right?" [...] Kandel said that first, Dr.-Karl-Lueger-Ring should be renamed.

[...] According to The Times, [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> 10 years' {{engagement}} at Daly's, from 1896 to 1905, that the memories of his many devoted admirers most fondly dwell." [...] Wright performed and created characters in many of Edwardes's most famous musical comedies, including: The Geisha (1896, as Wun-Hi), A Greek Slave (1898, as Heliodorus), San Toy (1899, as Li), A Country Girl (1902, as Barry), The Cingalee (1904, as Chambhuddy Ram), The Little Michus (1905, as Bagnolet) and See-See (1906, as Hang-Kee). The Times also said of this period of his career, [...] "those who remember the neat, perky, birdlike little man in these musical comedies, with his precise diction and his finished movements, will quote to each other his drolleries, and hug his memory in unashamed, selfish, and inexhaustible enjoyment." ...|$|E
