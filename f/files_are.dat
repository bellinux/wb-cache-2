5|$|On April 1, 2003, {{the game}} was {{released}} as freeware. The data <b>files</b> <b>are</b> available from the Revolution Software website for download and the game's engine {{has been added to}} ScummVM. This version of Lure of the Temptress was released on GOG.com on December 18, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Several months later, Miles is {{put under}} hypnosis. He recalls {{how he and}} his classmates were {{abducted}} in the forest as they celebrated their graduation; they were subjected to tests by the aliens, and killed when the tests failed. Scully provides Blevins with the metal implant, the only remaining piece of evidence. However, she later learns from Mulder that Miles' case <b>files</b> <b>are</b> missing. Meanwhile, The Smoking Man stores the implant away in a vast evidence room within the Pentagon.|$|E
5|$|Some NTFS {{features}} are not supported in ReFS, including object IDs, short names, file compression, file level encryption (EFS), user data transactions, hard links, extended attributes, and disk quotas. Sparse <b>files</b> <b>are</b> supported. Support for named streams is not implemented in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, {{though it was}} later added in Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2. ReFS does not itself offer data deduplication. Dynamic disks with mirrored or striped volumes are replaced with mirrored or striped storage pools provided by Storage Spaces. In Windows Server 2012, automated error-correction with integrity streams is only supported on mirrored spaces; automatic recovery on parity spaces was added in Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2. Booting from ReFS is not supported either.|$|E
50|$|When a <b>file</b> <b>is</b> {{recovered}} successfully, PhotoRec {{checks the}} previous data blocks {{to see whether}} a <b>file</b> signature <b>was</b> found but the <b>file</b> <b>was</b> not able to be successfully recovered (i.e., the <b>file</b> <b>was</b> too small), and it tries again. This way, some fragmented <b>files</b> can <b>be</b> successfully recovered.|$|R

5|$|There are two {{video games}} {{based on the}} film, one from 1985 for Commodore 64, Sinclair ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC by CRL Group PLC based on the music by Vangelis (due to {{licensing}} issues), and another action adventure PC game from 1997 by Westwood Studios. The 1997 video game featured new characters and branching storylines based on the Blade Runner world. Eldon Tyrell, Gaff, Leon, Rachael, Chew, and J.F. Sebastian appear, and their voice <b>files</b> <b>are</b> recorded by the original actors. The player assumes the role of McCoy, another replicant-hunter working {{at the same time}} as Deckard.|$|E
5|$|Windows 8.1 adds tighter {{integration}} with several Microsoft-owned services. OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) is integrated {{at the system}} level to sync user settings and files. <b>Files</b> <b>are</b> automatically downloaded in the background when they are accessed from the user's OneDrive folder, unless they are marked to be available offline. By default, only file metadata and thumbnails are stored locally, and reparse points are used to {{give the appearance of}} a normal directory structure to provide backwards compatibility. The OneDrive app was updated to include a local file manager. OneDrive use on Windows 8.1 requires that a user's Windows account be linked to a Microsoft account; the previous SkyDrive desktop client (which did not have this requirement) is not supported on Windows 8.1.|$|E
5|$|Before a {{translation}} is greenlit and translators are allocated for each language, the localization, quality assurance (QA) and marketing staff play through a build {{of the game}} and sometimes do a focus group study. The localization team's playthrough can sometimes take over 100 hours of gameplay. Once the company greenlights a localization project, a period of brainstorming starts in which glossary, style, naming schemes and fonts are chosen. During the translation phase, voiced sections are translated first. Text <b>files</b> <b>are</b> cross-checked by multiple translators and editors. The text is then integrated along with any graphic and sound changes, and the game goes to quality assurance. During a period of several weeks to up to three months, Japanese QA teams look for bugs while Western QA teams check linguistic issues. The localization team often re-plays the game during this phase, translates the manuals and help out on the guidebooks if these are made. Finally, the game is sent to the hardware manufacturers to be approved.|$|E
50|$|A single set of <b>files</b> <b>is</b> {{used for}} storing all tables. A {{separate}} set of <b>files</b> <b>is</b> {{used for all}} temporary data. The maximum size of a <b>file</b> set <b>is</b> 32 terabytes, for 4G × 8K pages.|$|R
50|$|The {{assembly}} <b>file</b> <b>is</b> queried using reflection {{to obtain}} the list of classes, methods, etc. The XML <b>file</b> <b>is</b> parsed for the documentation text.|$|R
50|$|The {{download}} of {{the relevant}} <b>files</b> <b>was</b> possible across all protocols and in parallel. The individual <b>file</b> fragments <b>were</b> compiled using a hash sum and an overlapping heuristic, thus ensuring that the downloaded <b>file</b> <b>was</b> complete and correct.|$|R
5|$|The Lone Gunmen contact Mulder and Scully about a {{successful}} attempt {{by a friend}} of theirs to hack the United States Department of Defense computer system. The hacker, Kenneth Soona (Bernie Coulson), is able to give Mulder the downloaded information on a digital cassette. However, Soona is later assassinated, and the downloaded <b>files</b> <b>are</b> found to be written in Navajo. Contacting Albert Hosteen (Floyd Red Crow Westerman)—a Navajo man capable of translating the files—Mulder is shown a box-car full of {{what appear to be}} alien corpses. He is trapped in the box-car by the series' antagonist, The Smoking Man (William B. Davis), and left for dead after it is destroyed. He is later found and nursed back to health by Hosteen. Meanwhile, Scully investigates the possible involvement of the smallpox eradication program in human genetic experimentation, discovering that a Nazi scientist who defected during Operation Paperclip has been conducting human experimentation to create alien-human hybrids. Her sister Melissa (Melinda McGraw), however, is shot by assassins who mistake her for Dana, and dies in hospital that night.|$|E
5|$|To {{reduce the}} storage {{footprint}} {{of the operating}} system, Windows 10 automatically compresses system files. The system can reduce the storage footprint of Windows by approximately 1.5GB for 32-bit systems and 2.6GB for 64-bit systems. The level of compression used is dependent on a performance assessment performed during installations or by OEMs, which tests how much compression can be used without harming operating system performance. Furthermore, the Refresh and Reset functions use runtime system files instead, making a separate recovery partition redundant, allowing patches and updates to remain installed following the operation, and further {{reducing the amount of}} space required for Windows 10 by up to 12GB. These functions replace the WIMBoot mode introduced on Windows 8.1 Update, which allowed OEMs to configure low-capacity devices with flash-based storage to use Windows system files out of the compressed WIM image typically used for installation and recovery. Windows 10 also includes a function in its Settings app that allows users to view a breakdown of how their device's storage capacity is being used by different types of files, and determine whether certain types of <b>files</b> <b>are</b> saved to internal storage or an SD card by default.|$|E

The <b>files</b> <b>are</b> correspondence from the public sent to the British government and officials, such as the MoD and Margaret Thatcher.
