5|$|HST uses {{gyroscopes}} {{to detect}} and measure any rotations so it can stabilize itself in orbit and point accurately and steadily at astronomical targets. Normally, three gyroscopes are required for operation; observations are still possible with two, but the area of sky that can be viewed would be somewhat restricted, and observations requiring very accurate pointing are more difficult. There are further contingency plans for observations with just one gyro, but if all <b>gyros</b> fail, continued scientific observations will not be possible. In 2005, {{it was decided to}} switch to two-gyroscope mode for regular telescope operations as a means of extending the lifetime of the mission. The switch to this mode was made in August 2005, leaving Hubble with two gyroscopes in use, two on backup, and two inoperable. One more gyro failed in 2007. By the time of the final repair mission in May 2009, during which all six <b>gyros</b> were replaced (with two new pairs and one refurbished pair), only three <b>gyros</b> were still working. Engineers determined that the gyro failures were caused by corrosion of electric wires powering the motor that was initiated by oxygen-pressurized air used to deliver the thick suspending fluid. The new gyro models were assembled using pressurized nitrogen and they should be much more reliable.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its scientific results, Hubble has also {{made significant contributions to}} aerospace engineering, in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit. These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth where they can be studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior of graphite composite structures in vacuum, optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing, radiation damage to electronics and sensors, and the long term behavior of multi-layer insulation. One lesson learned was that <b>gyros</b> assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion. <b>Gyros</b> are now assembled using pressurized nitrogen.|$|E

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to analyze the nonstationary <b>gyro</b> signal in detail for the Allan variance (AV) analysis method. A novel approach in the time-frequency domain for <b>gyro</b> signal characteristics analysis is proposed based on the empirical mode decomposition and Allan variance (EMDAV). The output signal of <b>gyro</b> is decomposed by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) first, and then the decomposed signal is analyzed by AV algorithm. Consequently, the <b>gyro</b> noise characteristics are demonstrated in the time-frequency domain with a three-dimensional (3 D) manner. Practical data of fiber optic <b>gyro</b> (FOG) and MEMS <b>gyro</b> are processed by the AV method and the EMDAV algorithm separately. The {{results indicate that the}} details of <b>gyro</b> signal characteristics in different frequency bands can be described with the help of EMDAV, and the analysis dimensions are extended compared with the common AV. The proposed EMDAV, as a complementary tool of the AV, which provides a theoretical reference for the <b>gyro</b> signal preprocessing, is a general approach for the analysis and evaluation of <b>gyro</b> performance...|$|R

25|$|The EDS was {{distributed}} throughout the vehicle and includes some components in the IU. There were nine EDS rate <b>gyros</b> installed at location 15 in the IU. Three <b>gyros</b> monitored {{each of the three}} axes (pitch, roll and yaw), providing triple redundancy. The control signal processor (location 15) provided power to and received inputs from the nine EDS rate <b>gyros.</b> These inputs were processed and sent to the EDS distributor (location 14) and to the flight control computer (location 16). The EDS distributor served as a junction box and switching device to furnish the spacecraft display panels with emergency signals if emergency conditions existed. It also contained relay and diode logic for the automatic abort sequence. An electronic timer (location 17) was activated at liftoff and 30 seconds later energized relays in the EDS distributor which allowed multiple engine shutdown. This function was inhibited during the first 30 seconds of launch, to preclude the vehicle falling back into the launch area. While the automatic abort was inhibited, the flight crew can initiate a manual abort if an angular-overrate or two-engine-out condition arose.|$|E

In practice, English transliterations are also often used, such as <b>gyros</b> instead of gírosz).|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the success, the design also {{demonstrated}} several serious problems. In particular, the gyroscopic platform had to be leveled out before use using several spirit levels, and then checked and repeatedly reset for accuracy. Worse, the <b>gyros</b> had a limited degree of movement, and if the plane banked far enough the gyro would reach its limit {{and have to be}} re-set from scratch - something that could happen even due to strong turbulence. If the <b>gyros</b> were found to be off, the leveling procedure took as long as eight and a half minutes. Other minor problems were the direct current electric motors which drove the gyroscopes, whose brushes wore down quickly and left carbon dust throughout the interior of the device, and the positioning of the control knobs, which meant the bombardier could only adjust side-to-side or up-and-down aim at a time, not both. But in spite of all of these problems, the Mark XV was so superior to any other design that the Navy ordered it into production.|$|E

25|$|Norden's {{first attempt}} at an {{improved}} bombsight was actually an advance in PDI design. His idea was to remove the manual electrical switches used to move the pointer and use the entire bombsight itself as the indicator. He proposed attaching a low-power sighting telescope to a gyro platform that would keep the telescope pointed at the same azimuth, correcting for the aircraft's movements. The bombardier would simply rotate the telescope left or right to follow the target. This motion would cause the <b>gyros</b> to precess, and this signal would drive the PDI automatically.|$|E
25|$|To reduce {{errors in}} sensing {{attitude}} and velocity, designers cut friction {{to a minimum}} in the platform <b>gyros</b> and accelerometers by floating the bearings on a thin film of dry nitrogen.

40|$|Even {{when the}} Global Positioning System (GPS) signal is blocked, a rate {{gyroscope}} (<b>gyro)</b> north finder {{is capable of}} providing the required azimuth reference information to a certain extent. In order to measure the azimuth between the observer and the north direction very accurately, we propose a multi-position non-continuous rotation <b>gyro</b> north finding scheme. Our new generalized mathematical model analyzes the elements that affect the azimuth measurement precision and can thus provide high precision azimuth reference information. Based on the <b>gyro’s</b> principle of detecting a projection of the earth rotation rate on its sensitive axis and the proposed north finding scheme, {{we are able to}} deduct an accurate mathematical model of the <b>gyro</b> outputs against azimuth with the <b>gyro</b> and shaft misalignments. Combining the <b>gyro</b> outputs model and the theory of propagation of uncertainty, some approaches to optimize north finding are provided, including reducing the <b>gyro</b> bias error, constraining the <b>gyro</b> random error, increasing the number of rotation points, improving rotation angle measurement precision, decreasing the <b>gyro</b> and the shaft misalignment angles. According them, a north finder setup is built and the azimuth uncertainty of 18 ” is obtained. This paper provides systematic theory for analyzing the details of the <b>gyro</b> north finder scheme from simulation to implementation. The proposed theory can guide both applied researchers in academia and advanced practitioners in industry for designing high precision robust north finder based on different types of rate gyroscopes...|$|R

They found out how deep the cavern is and pumped up some helium gas into the cavern as the money slowly went back up to the Money Bin. Unfortunately the gas worked too well as it made the Money Bin float into the air. Little Helper used his head to break the plastic cover to let the gas out and The Money Bin wound up on the statue of Cornelius Coot.

500|$|The {{increasing}} {{size and}} power of the armoured cruiser led to suggestions in British naval circles that cruisers should displace battleships entirely. The battleship's main advantage was its 12-inch heavy guns, and heavier armour designed to protect from shells of similar size. However, for a few years after 1900 it seemed that those advantages were of little practical value. The torpedo now had a range of 2,000 yards, and it seemed unlikely that a battleship would engage within torpedo range. However, at ranges of more than 2,000 yards it became increasingly unlikely that the heavy guns of a battleship would score any hits, as the heavy guns relied on primitive aiming techniques. The secondary batteries of 6-inch quick-firing guns, firing more plentiful shells, were more likely to hit the enemy. As naval expert Fred T. Jane wrote in June 1902,Is there anything outside of 2,000 yards that the big gun in its hundreds of tons of medieval castle can effect, that its weight in 6-inch guns without the castle could not effect equally well?

500|$|Still {{very much}} {{interested}} in insects, Edwards spent his spare time at the California Academy of Sciences studying butterflies under Hans Hermann Behr, the academy's curator for Lepidoptera, the scientific order of moths and butterflies. Elected {{a member of the}} academy in 1867, he concentrated on describing the structure and habits of moths and butterflies on the Pacific coast from British Columbia to Baja California. He went to visit John Muir in Yosemite Valley in June 1871, with a letter of introduction from Jeanne Carr, the wife of California's chief geologist Ezra S. Carr. The letter described Edwards as [...] "one of Nature's truest and most devoted disciples", a sojourner who [...] "has the keys to the Kingdom". After the visit, Muir occasionally sent specimens from the Sierras to add to Edwards' collection, carried to San Francisco by men such as geologist and artist Clarence King who were returning from Yosemite field study. Edwards presented a series of papers to the academy entitled Pacific Coast Lepidoptera, and classified two species as new to science. He named one <b>Gyros</b> muiri for Muir, with [...] "Hy. Edw." [...] as the attribution. In 1872, Muir sent Edwards a letter, writing [...] "You are now in constant remembrance, because every flying flower is branded with your name." [...] In 1873, Edwards became the curator of entomology at the academy, and began to serve on the Publications Committee which produced the journal Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences. Beginning early that year, he befriended George Robert Crotch. Although it is sometimes claimed that he accompanied Crotch on his insect collecting tour of California, Oregon and British Columbia, Edwards was only aware of Crotch's travels as a correspondent. [...] Edwards independently visited British Columbia in 1873, missing Crotch by several days at Vancouver Island. [...] In 1874, Edwards began to serve as one of the academy's vice presidents, and for the academy in late 1874 after Crotch's death from tuberculosis, he published a memorial tribute to the man. Edwards also wrote one of many tributes to academician Louis Agassiz at his death in late 1873. At the academy on January 2, 1877, Edwards was elected member for life.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to <b>gyro</b> calibration where, in addition to being used for computing attitude that is needed in the calibration process, the <b>gyro</b> outputs are also used as measurements in a Kalman filter. <b>Gyro</b> calibration as well as calibration of other instruments occurs in two steps. In the first step, the instrument error parameters are estimated. During the second stage, those errors are continuously removed from the <b>gyro</b> readings. In the classical approach to <b>gyro</b> calibration, the <b>gyro</b> outputs are used to maintain or compute body orientation rather than being used as measurements in the context of filtering. In inertial navigation, for example, <b>gyro</b> errors cause erroneous computation of velocity and position, and then when the latter are compared to measured velocity and position, a great portion of the computed velocity and position errors can be determined. The latter errors are then fed into a Kalman filter (KF) that uses the INS error model to infer on the <b>gyro</b> errors. Similarly, when applying the classical approach to spacecraft (SC) altitude determination, the <b>gyro</b> outputs are used to compute the attitude and then attitude measurements are used to determine the attitude errors, which again using a KF, indicates what the <b>gyro</b> errors are. In the approach adopted in this work the <b>gyro</b> outputs are used as angular rate measurements and are compared to estimated angular rate measurements. However, this approach requires the knowledge of the angular rate. In the past, the estimated angular rate was computed in a rather simplistic way assuming that the rate was constant. In the present work, the estimated angular rate is derived using a KF whose input can be any kind of attitude measurement, therefore the angular rate experienced by the SC can be continuously changing, and yet a good estimate of the rate, necessary for calibration, can be obtained...|$|R
