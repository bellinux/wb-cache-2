50|$|Charlton's {{return to}} the second tier of English {{football}} was a disappointment, with their promotion campaign tailing off to an 11th-place finish.

On 10 October 2008 Charlton received an indicative offer for the club from a Dubai-based <b>diversified</b> <b>investment</b> <b>company.</b> However, the deal later fell through. The full significance of this soon became apparent as the club recorded net losses of over £13 million for that financial year. Pardew left on 22 November after a 2-5 home loss to Sheffield United that saw the team fall into the relegation places. Matters did not improve under caretaker manager Phil Parkinson, and the team went a club record 18 games without a win, a new club record, before finally achieving a 1-0 away victory over Norwich City in an FA Cup Third Round replay; Parkinson was hired on a permanent basis. The team were relegated to League One after a 2-2 draw against Blackpool on 18 April 2009.|$|E

40|$|Investors seek to {{maximize}} the overall returns of <b>diversified</b> <b>investment</b> portfolios. That is, ideally investors would like to receive increasing risk-adjusted returns over a given period. In order to achieve this they allocate different percentages in different asset classes to form <b>diversified</b> <b>investment</b> portfolios. One of the asset classes that is considered for asset allocation is property. When allocating the property component, an investor has a choice of investing in either direct-held properties or listed properties. This research report focuses on listed properties, and property unit trusts (PUTs) will be the main focus not property loan stocks (PLSs). The literature (national and international) consensus is that listed property can be equity security, fixed-income security or hybrid security in a <b>diversified</b> <b>investment.</b> However, the dominant school of thought is that listed property funds has similar characteristics supported by empirical studies by Myer and Terris (1995), and Friday and Higgins (2000) and the less dominant school of thought is that listed property has gilts characteristics supported by empirical study by Kuhle (1987). Most of those empirical studies were undertaken in United States of America. At the moment, in South Africa (SA), there hardly any empirical studies comparing listed property funds and other asset classes expect a few real estate analyses by real estate analysts such as Leon Allison from First South Securities (South Africa) which show high positive relationship between listed property funds and bonds. Directly held property is a complex asset due to its physical structure, types of property, and natural forces and factors that affect land. Proper and efficient maintenance contribute to the value appreciation of property. When you diversify through usage of directly held property, {{it is better to}} have a limited the number of properties included in a <b>diversified</b> <b>investment</b> portfolio in ii order for them (physical property) to be manageable. The more physical properties you have in an investment portfolio, the more people needed to manage those physical properties. More importantly, physically help property has direct impact on the listed property fund. Tax changes can either persuade or dissuade people to invest in property market. In attempting to establish whether or not PUTs increase the overall returns of <b>diversified</b> <b>investment</b> portfolio conclusions were drawn from literature survey, research findings and hypothesis testing. There was no conclusive evidence suggesting whether PUTs enhances overall absolute returns; however, listed property funds reduce risk of the <b>diversified</b> <b>investment</b> portfolios. In certain case, as shown by Kuhle (1987), the more assets investors include their investment portfolios, the more risk reduction is prevalent in <b>diversified</b> <b>investment</b> portfolios. Other studies such as Friedman (1971) showed the inclusion of listed property trusts in a <b>diversified</b> <b>investment</b> portfolio minimizes maximum losses and earns reasonable returns. Therefore, listed property is a hybrid security and diversification does not necessarily increase after risk-adjusted returns but does reduce risk. From available data, the hypothesis test confirmed that introduction of PUTs in a <b>diversified</b> <b>investment</b> portfolio does not necessarily increases returns. The research report further confirmed that listed property funds have both characteristics of equities and fixed-income securities. Going forward, having a <b>diversified</b> <b>investment</b> portfolio is an advisable strategy especially in case of unforeseen market conditions. <b>Diversified</b> <b>investment</b> portfolios works more like defensive stocks because investors make minimum losses while making reasonable returns during unforeseen circumstances. Historically the property market has outperformed other markets. Finally, diversification seems not to increase the overall returns of <b>diversified</b> <b>investment</b> despite decreasing the risk of <b>diversified</b> <b>investment</b> portfolio...|$|R
