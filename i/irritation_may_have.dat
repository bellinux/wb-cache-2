Ingres' <b>irritation</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been further exacerbated by the hanging of his work below a painting depicting [...] "four or five life-sized cows returning to their stable". The result was that Ingres resolved never again to exhibit at the Salon or to accept any public commissions. He applied for and received a position as director of the French Academy in Rome, and left Paris in December 1834 to begin a self-imposed exile in Italy. He did not return to France until 1841. In November 1834 The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian was installed in Autun Cathedral.|$|E
40|$|We {{have lived}} {{in an era of}} crusades, {{ideologies}} and causes. We whose lives extend into a second generation look back on causes and leaders of causes which were with us but not with those of the second generation. Such is not the fate of Justice Holmes. He continues, if only a subject of controversy. Two reasons for the continuity are apparent at once. He wrote well: “Worships language and forgives... Everyone by whom it lives,” and he wrote on law and justice—universals which interest everyone and which have inspired teachers from a time extending back through Aristotle and Plato. There is another reason for a continuing interest in Justice Holmes. It is not so apparent in our era. Time may develop it clear and sharp. We are conscious of it, though, through our inability to classify Justice Holmes. Some regarded him as a liberal, others have been sure that the Justice was a radical, and still others treated the Justice as a source of social and political mischief. This <b>irritation</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> found its source in the difficulty that arises when we look for a category that fits. What later generations may see clear and sharp is an objectiveness of mind that became notable in the Northern Securities litigation, and which leaves Justice Holmes in our era as a man without a cause. I propose to develop this thought by comparisons and contrasts with men who were working during that period; then I shall refer to the quality in the Justice’s work...|$|E

Such are, the various adjustments of length and position of the stamens to bring the pollen to the insect and from the insect to the stigma; the various motions of stamens and styles at the right time and the right direction; the physiological adjustments bringing about fertility or sterility in heterostyled plants; the traps, springs, and complex movements of various parts of orchids; and innumerable other remarkable phenomena.|$|R

40|$|What {{is known}} about the topic of this paper • Limited {{information}} as regard to this condition in Rhino’s. What this paper adds to the field of veterinary dermatology • Surgical intervention is currative in some cases. • Contributing to the sparse information on skin tumours in rhino’s. A captive 33 -year-old male white rhinoceros with seasonal dermatitis was diagnosed with a malignant squamous cell carcinoma on the right flank. Staphylo-coccus aureus was cultured from the skin lesions. No fungal or yeast was isolated. The dermatitis was treated with a combination of oral antibiotics (trimethoprim–sulphadiazine) and topically with weekly chlorhexidine washes and a mixture of a zinc oxide, balsam peru and bismuth oxide cream. Under azaperone and butorphanol anaesthesia, the skin tumour was surgically removed. The tumour was excised with wide margins and allowed to heal by secondary intention as primary wound closure was not possible. A post-mortem performed 2 years later for an unrelated condition revealed no metastases or recurrence of the skin tumour. It was presumed that chronic <b>irritation</b> or trauma <b>may</b> <b>have</b> contributed {{to the development of the}} skin tumour. This is the first detailed report of the successful treatment of a squamous cell carcinoma not associated with the horn in a rhinoceros...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{report on}} {{a case of a}} 65 -year-old man with {{pigmented}} clear-cell acanthoma located on the right thigh. Dermoscopy disclosed a peculiar picture consisting of diffuse black pigmentation with a superficial greyish veil in the central portion, dotted-to-globular dark red-black structures mainly located at the periphery with a homogenous regular reticular arrangement; peripheral translucid desquamation. Dermoscopic features are correlated with the histology, where hemosiderin deposits present in a sheet-like arrangement in the perivascular papillary dermis and in a band-like disposition in the reticular dermis {{at the base of the}} lesion can account for the pigmented picture. The lesion arose on a trauma-prone skin site; thus the authors believe that traumatic <b>irritation</b> <b>may</b> be responsible for the clinical and dermoscopic pictures, giving rise to a reaction similar in a way to the Auspitz′s sign provocated by trauma for psoriasis.

40|$|Professor A. Strekalovsky (Irkutsk) {{has made}} me {{aware of the fact}} that in [4], Comtet merely reformulates (with proper credit) the Motzkin/Straus result [7] on the {{connection}} between the Maximum Clique Problem and global solutions to a certain standard quadratic optimization problem (QP), the so-called Motzkin/Straus program. Motivated by an (overly modest?) citation in [5], I erroneously related Comtet to the regularization of the Motzkin/Straus program put forward in my articles [1, 2]. To the best of my current knowledge, however, the first references to which this regular-ization can be related is indeed the 1988 textbook by Hofbauer and Sigmund itself [5] and (independently as it seems) the article by Cannings and Vickers [3] (note that [3] is cited in the follow-up 1998 book by Hofbauer and Sigmund [6]). While Hofbauer and Sigmund explicitly introduce in [5, 6] what I termed Comtet-regularized adjacency matrix ÂG in [1, 2], Cannings and Vickers use in [3] the matrix A = 2 ÂG −E instead, and in a slightly different context (E denotes the suitable all-ones matrix). Obviously the standard QPs based on both 1 matrices, ÂG and 2 ÂG −E, are equivalent (see, e. g. [2]). Also the terminology Comtet class I used in [2] for C(w,G), a class of certain symmetric matrices, can be misleading for the same reason. I apologize for any <b>irritations</b> these mishaps <b>may</b> <b>have</b> caused. Nevertheless, all the results on ÂG and C(w,G) which were claimed to be new in [1, 2], appear to be formulated and proved for the first time there...|$|R
50|$|Overexposure to {{isocyanates}} can sensitize workers, {{making them}} subject to asthma attacks {{if they are}} exposed again. Respiratory <b>irritation</b> <b>may</b> progress to a chemical bronchitis. Additional exposures can make the onset easier with less isocyanate necessary to start the attack. Sporadic cases of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) have also been reported in workers exposed to isocyanates. The symptoms may seem like the flu, with fever, muscle aches, and headaches. Other symptoms may include a dry cough, chest tightness, and difficult breathing. Individuals with chronic HP often experience progressively more difficult breathing, fatigue, and weight loss. Individuals with acute HP typically develop symptoms 4-6 hours after exposure.|$|R

This condition can range from mild irritation to severe irritation.

Symptoms include swelling of the bitten area, erythema, ulcers of the mouth and throat, restlessness, and soreness of the areolae.
