40|$|What is {{the cost}} of {{off-site}} hazardous waste disposal? In addition to paying for disposal fees and shipments costs, generators of hazardous waste can potentially be held liable for the cost of cleanup if the waste disposal site contaminates the environment after closure or abandonment and thus falls under the federal or state Superfund legislation. This paper empirically examines the sensitivity of individual hazardous waste generators to these categories of costs, exploiting the variation across states in factors influencing disposal costs, and {{in the structure of the}} liability imposed on waste generators under certain circumstances by state laws. We fit nested logit models to predict the waste management method (incineration or landfill disposal) and the state of destination for shipments of <b>halogenated</b> <b>solvent</b> waste used for metal cleaning in manufacturing and reported in the Toxic Release Inventory in 1988 – 1990.

Both diastereomers E- 5 and Z- 5 are stereochemically {{stable in}} solid state but show significant photosensibility in solutions of <b>halogenated</b> <b>solvent.</b> The photoisomerization equilibrium of E/Z- 5 is therefore deduced from the H- 1 NMR profile after visible-light irradiation of both E- 5 and Z- 5 samples. The {{results of the}} kinetic study, monitored by UV-HPLC, reveal that the E/Z equilibrium is diastereoselective and photodependent, being the transformation E -> Z proceeding faster than that of Z -> E, and the E/Z ratio at the equilibrium depends on the used solvent, light source, and temperature. Both diastereomers are visible-light photosensitive tending to coexist together in equilibrium solutions at a determined ratio, which is always {{in favor of the}} Z-product assuming a minimum thermodynamic energy and an increased entropy of the system. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations suggest that the photoisomerization mechanism proceeds via a conical intersection involving the first-excited state: Upon irradiation, the E- 5 isomer is excited to the S 1 potential energy surface, where it relaxes through rotation of the C=C bond and reaches a conical intersection with the ground-state potential energy surface, thus yielding the Z- 5 isomer.

Since the rate of metabolism and the stereospecificity of metabolism are dependent on the types and amount of P 450 s available, FN might drastically alter the metabolic activation of a precarcinogen, such as TRI, and its toxicological consequences. Male CD 1 mice were divided into untreated, vehicle control, and experimental groups. Animals of the latter groups were treated ip with 150 mg/kg bw FN in corn oil, 457 mg/kg bw TRI in corn oil, TRI plus FN separated by different time intervals. Bone marrow cells were harvested for determination of micronuclei (MN) frequencies in polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE). The presence of the known metabolite of TRI, trichloroethanol (TCE), was quantitated in collected urine by gas chromatography using an electron-capture detector. Linear regression analysis shows that MN frequency by TRI is correlated with TCE concentration in urine. Observed potentiation of genotoxicity of TRI by FN pretreatment (1 hr before TRI treatment) apparently reflects changes in the spectra of enzymes involved in TRI metabolism, and altered toxicokinetic, as witnessed by the 20 % difference in TCE excretion from combined treated mice. However, no increased genetic or metabolic effects were observed when FN was administered 3 hr before TRI. No significant interactive effects were observed at a genetic level when FN was administered 1 hr and 3 hr after TRI whereas a 33 to 47 % loss in TCE excretion was recorded.
