25|$|As {{the world}} becomes more closely linked through economics, politics, technology, and culture (a process called globalization), cities {{have come to}} play {{a leading role in}} {{transnational}} affairs, exceeding the limitations of international relations conducted by national governments.

500|$|The {{creative}} {{deficit of}} the city-state is evident {{to the author}} also in the Singaporeans' obsession with consumerism as a pastime, the homogeneity of the retailers and their fare, and in what he characterizes as their other passion: dining (although he finds fault with {{the diversity of the}} food, it is, he remarks [...] "something to write home about"). He returns then to the theme of the staid insipidity of the city-state, observing the unsettling cleanliness of the physical environment and the self-policing of the populace.

Given that such games exist in complete <b>information</b> <b>economies,</b> can this gap be filled by games that leak information endogenously without enlarging the equilibrium set? The author adopts two approaches. First, he introduces a theory of "cheap play" as a natural model of such games. The second is an extreme approach that adopts an ex post viewpoint.

40|$|To {{contribute}} to understanding of <b>information</b> <b>economies</b> of daily life, this paper explores {{over the past}} millennium given names {{of a large number}} of persons. Analysts have long both condemned and praised mass media as a source of common culture, national unity, or shared symbolic experiences. Names, however, indicate a large decline in shared symbolic experience over the past two centuries, a decline that the growth of mass media does not appear to have affected significantly. Study of names also shows that action and personal relationships, along with time horizon, are central aspects of effective communication across a large population. The observed preference for personalization over the past two centuries and the importance of action and personal relationships to effective communication are aspects of <b>information</b> <b>economies</b> that are likely to have continuing significance for industry developments, economic statistics, and public policy. 1 The most current version is available fro...|$|R

40|$|The {{rational}} agency assumption limits {{systems to}} domains of application {{that have never}} been observed. Moreover, representing agents as being rational in the sense of maximising utility subject to some well specified constraints renders software systems virtiually unscalable. These properties of the rational agency assumption are shown to be unnecessary in representations or analogies of markets. The demonstration starts with an analysis of how the rational agency assumption limits the applicability and scalability of the IBM <b>information</b> filetering <b>economy.</b> An unrestricted specification of the <b>information</b> filtering <b>economy</b> is developed from an analysis of the properties of markets as systems and the implementation of a model based on intelligent agents.
