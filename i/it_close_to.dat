5|$|In 2006, Marcelo Weksler {{published}} a large-scale cladistic analysis of Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), the group (tribe) to which hammondi {{and the related}} species mentioned above belong. He used both morphological and molecular characters, but had only morphological data for Oryzomys hammondi. The placement of the species in his results was unstable; some trees placed <b>it</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the tree rice rats, Oecomys, within clade B and others placed it as an isolated lineage, basal to all other Oryzomyini.|$|E
5|$|Once {{over the}} eastern Gulf of Mexico, the storm shifted its course to the west-southwest and {{gradually}} recovered its intensity. The {{path of the}} storm brought <b>it</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> {{the mouth of the}} Rio Grande in early August. Few ships encountered the small storm as it regained hurricane status on August4, just aday before striking northern Mexico with winds of 90mph (145km/h)—making <b>it</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> a modern-day Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Striking close to the border between the United States and Mexico, the storm caused extensive damage in both countries. Winds damaged buildings and crops in Tamaulipas and the southern regions of Texas, with heavy losses to citrus production in the Rio Grande Valley. While only oneperson died in the United States, heavy rains led to catastrophic flooding that claimed at least 31lives in northern Mexico; the worst-hit areas were in and near the city of Monterrey. While monetary losses in Mexico were unclear, the storm did at least $3,000,000 in damages in the United States, measured in contemporary U.S. dollars.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 2006, the Nashville Sounds {{had planned to}} leave Herschel Greer Stadium for a new {{ballpark}} to be called First Tennessee Field, but the project was abandoned after the city, developers, and team could not come to terms {{on a plan to}} finance its construction. Instead, Greer was repaired and upgraded to keep <b>it</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Triple-A standards until a new stadium could be built. In late 2013, talks about {{the construction of a new}} ballpark—later called First Tennessee Park—were revived. Three possible sites were identified by the architectural firm Populous as being suitable for a new stadium: the east bank of the Cumberland River, the North Gulch area, and Sulphur Dell. Sulphur Dell, the site of the city's original ballpark from 1870 to 1963, was chosen.|$|E
5|$|Nigersaurus was {{suggested}} by Sereno and colleagues to be a ground-level, non-selective browser. The {{width of the}} muzzle and lateral orientation of the tooth row show that the sauropod could gather much food and crop <b>it</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the ground, within one metre of the surface. This is further supported by facets on the labial (externally facing) side of the upper teeth, similar to Dicraeosaurus and Diplodocus, which are evidence that food or substrate wore the animal's teeth as it fed. Nigersaurus also bears signs of low-angle tooth-to-tooth wear {{on the inside of}} the maxillary crowns, which suggests that jaw movement was limited to precise up-and-down motions. Worn teeth from the lower jaw have not yet been discovered, but they are expected to show opposing tooth-to-tooth wear. The ability to raise their heads well above the ground does not necessarily mean they browsed on items there, and the short neck of Nigersaurus would have restricted the browsing range compared to other diplodocoids.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{the wider}} Operation Barclay, Mincemeat {{was based on the}} 1939 Trout memo, written by Rear Admiral John Godfrey, the Director of the Naval Intelligence Division, and his {{personal}} assistant, Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming. With the approval of the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and the overall military commander in the Mediterranean, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the plan began with transporting the body to the southern coast of Spain by submarine, and releasing <b>it</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> shore. It was picked up the following morning by a Spanish fisherman. The nominally neutral Spanish government shared copies of the documents with the , the German military intelligence organisation, before returning the originals to the British. Forensic examination showed they had been read, and decrypts of German messages showed the Germans fell for the ruse. Reinforcements were shifted to Greece and Sardinia both before and during the invasion of Sicily; Sicily received none.|$|E
5|$|Reid {{considered}} the genus allied to Leucogyrophana, then thought {{to belong to}} the family Coniophoraceae. Marinus Anton Donk, in a monograph published the next year, agreed and placed <b>it</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Serpula and Coniophora; these genera are now known to represent early-diverging lineages in the Boletales order. However, the white spore print and small, smooth, and hyaline spores are not characteristic of species in the Coniophoraceae. In a large-scale phylogenetic analysis published in 2006, Podoserpula nested far from them in the Plicaturopsis clade, an evolutionarily related group of early-diverging members of the Agaricales order. Other taxa in this clade include Plicaturopsis and Sclerotium rolfsii. The entire clade was later separated into three smaller orders, Podoserpula becoming a member of the Amylocorticiales along with mostly corticioid genera such as Amylocorticium and Serpulomyces.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the Borneo shark are uncertain. Jack Garrick, in his 1982 morphological study, did not place <b>it</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> any {{other member of}} the genus. Leonard Compagno in 1988 tentatively grouped it with the smalltail shark (C. porosus), blackspot shark (C. sealei), spottail shark (C. sorrah), creek whaler (C. fitzroyensis), whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri), hardnose shark (C. macloti), and Pondicherry shark (C. hemiodon). The Borneo shark resembles the sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon) in certain traits, for example the enlarged pores by its mouth. Nevertheless, other aspects of its morphology firmly place it within Carcharhinus.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{the only}} other {{scenario}} writer on the project was Yūto Tonokawa of Key, who previously contributed on Key's sixth game Little Busters!. Tanaka was tasked with drawing up the entire scenario framework, and during this time, Takahiro Baba suggested that one more heroine route {{be added to the}} story to bring the total to six, but to do that they had to hire another writer. Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion, the creators of the Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Umineko no Naku Koro ni game franchises, was brought in as the third scenario writer after Baba suggested in late 2007 that Key ask him to join the staff for Rewrite. Ultimately, Tanaka wrote the story leading up to the heroine's routes, Kotori's and Akane's scanarios, the Moon and Terra routes, and the bonus Oppai route. Tonokawa wrote Chihaya's and Sizuru's routes, and Ryukishi07 wrote Lucia's story. Tanaka initially planned on the length of Rewrites story to be on about the same scale as Key's second game Air, but as it increased in size, he later attempted to keep <b>it</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the scale of Little Busters!.|$|E

While its RPG elements were limited, lacking traditional statistical or leveling systems, the game featured real-time combat with a gun, bringing <b>it</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the action RPG formula that Falcom would later be known for. The game's desert island overworld also featured a day-night cycle, non-player characters the player could attack or converse with, and the need to survive by finding and consuming rations to restore hit points lost with each normal action.|$|E
25|$|The Stratford-upon-Avon Canal was {{conceived}} {{as part of}} a network of canals which would allow coal from the Dudley Canal and the Stourbridge Canal to reach Oxford and London, without having to use the Birmingham canals, the management of which was seen as high-handed. An Act was passed on 28 March 1793 {{for the construction of a}} canal from a junction with the Worcester and Birmingham Canal in Kings Norton to Stratford-upon-Avon. The Canal Company was empowered to raise £120,000 by issuing shares and an additional £60,000 if required. The route would take <b>it</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Warwick and Birmingham Canal at Lapworth, but the act did not include any provision for a direct connection with it, or with the River Avon at Stratford. Negotiations started with the Warwick and Birmingham, and to second act was obtained on 19 May 1795, to allow a connecting link to be built, despite rather unfavourable terms imposed on through traffic by the other company.|$|E
