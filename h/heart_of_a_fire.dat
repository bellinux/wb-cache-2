60|$|Getting my {{bearings}} {{again with}} some difficulty, I now made a wide detour to the left, {{in the hope}} of passing around this outpost and striking the river beyond. In this mad attempt I ran upon a more vigilant sentinel, posted in the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thicket, who <b>fired</b> at me without challenge. To a soldier an unexpected shot ringing out at dead of night is fraught with an awful significance. In my circumstances--cut off from my comrades, groping about an unknown country, surrounded by invisible perils which such a signal would call into eager activity--the flash and shock of that firearm were unspeakably dreadful! In any case I should and ought to have fled, and did so; but how much or little of conscious prudence there was in the prompting I do not care to discover by analysis of memory. I went back into the corn, found the river, followed it back a long way and mounted into the fork <b>of</b> <b>a</b> low tree. There I perched until the dawn, a most uncomfortable bird.|$|R
60|$|The {{progress}} of the fight along the beach road was visible from Mulinuu, and Brandeis despatched ten boats of reinforcements. They crossed the harbour, paused for a while beside the Adler--it is supposed for ammunition--and drew near the Matautu shore. The Mataafa men lay close among the shore-side bushes, expecting their arrival; when a silly lad, in mere lightness <b>of</b> <b>heart,</b> <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> shot in the air. My native friend, Mrs. Mary Hamilton, ran {{out of her house}} and gave the culprit a good shaking: an episode in the midst of battle as incongruous as the grazing cow. But his sillier comrades followed his example; a harmless volley warned the boats what they might expect; and they drew back and passed outside the reef for the passage of the Fuisa. Here they came under the fire of {{the right wing of the}} Mataafas on the river-bank. The beach, raked east and west, appeared to them no place to land on. And they hung off in the deep water of the lagoon inside the barrier reef, feebly fusillading the pilot house.|$|R
6000|$|And thither {{came the}} twain, and when Geraint [...] Beheld her first in field, {{awaiting}} him, [...] He felt, were she the prize of bodily force, [...] Himself beyond the rest pushing could move [...] The chair of Idris. Yniol's rusted arms [...] Were on his princely person, but through these [...] Princelike his bearing shone; and errant knights [...] And ladies came, and {{by and by}} the town [...] Flowed in, and settling circled all the lists. [...] And there they fixt the forks into the ground, [...] And over these they placed the silver wand, [...] And over that the golden sparrow-hawk. [...] Then Yniol's nephew, after trumpet blown, [...] Spake to the lady with him and proclaimed, [...] 'Advance and take, as fairest of the fair, [...] What I these two years past have won for thee, [...] The prize of beauty.' Loudly spake the Prince, [...] 'Forbear: there is a worthier,' and the knight [...] With some surprise and thrice as much disdain [...] Turned, and beheld the four, and all his face [...] Glowed like the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> great <b>fire</b> at Yule, [...] So burnt he was with passion, crying out, [...] 'Do battle for it then,' no more; and thrice [...] They clashed together, and thrice they brake their spears. [...] Then each, dishorsed and drawing, lashed at each [...] So often and with such blows, that all the crowd [...] Wondered, and now and then from distant walls [...] There came <b>a</b> clapping as <b>of</b> phantom hands. [...] So twice they fought, and twice they breathed, and still [...] The dew of their great labour, and the blood [...] Of their strong bodies, flowing, drained their force. [...] But either's force was matched till Yniol's cry, [...] 'Remember that great insult done the Queen,' [...] Increased Geraint's, who heaved his blade aloft, [...] And cracked the helmet through, and bit the bone, [...] And felled him, and set foot upon his breast, [...] And said, 'Thy name?' To whom the fallen man [...] Made answer, groaning, 'Edyrn, son of Nudd! [...] Ashamed am I that I should tell it thee. [...] My pride is broken: men have seen my fall.' [...] 'Then, Edyrn, son of Nudd,' replied Geraint, [...] 'These two things shalt thou do, or else thou diest. [...] First, thou thyself, with damsel and with dwarf, [...] Shalt ride to Arthur's court, and coming there, [...] Crave pardon for that insult done the Queen, [...] And shalt abide her judgment on it; next, [...] Thou shalt give back their earldom to thy kin. [...] These two things shalt thou do, or thou shalt die.' [...] And Edyrn answered, 'These things will I do, [...] For I have never yet been overthrown, [...] And thou hast overthrown me, and my pride [...] Is broken down, for Enid sees my fall!' [...] And rising up, he rode to Arthur's court, [...] And there the Queen forgave him easily. [...] And being young, he changed and came to loathe [...] His crime of traitor, slowly drew himself [...] Bright from his old dark life, and fell at last [...] In the great battle fighting for the King.|$|R
40|$|The University of North Dakota Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC), in {{partnership}} with United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) under a U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) contract, has designed, constructed, and operated a 3. 0 -million Btu/hr (3. 2 x 10 {sup 6 } kJ/hr) slagging furnace system (SFS). Successful operation has demonstrated that the SFS meets design objectives and is well suited for testing very high-temperature heat exchanger concepts. Test results have shown that a high-temperature radiant air heater (RAH) panel designed and constructed by UTRC and used in the SFS can produce a 2000 F (1094 C) process air stream. To support the pilot-scale work, the EERC has also constructed laboratory- and bench-scale equipment which {{was used to determine}} the corrosion resistance of refractory and structural materials and develop methods to improve corrosion resistance. DOE projects that from 1995 to 2015, worldwide use of electricity will double to approach 20 trillion kilowatt hours. This growth comes during <b>a</b> time <b>of</b> concern over global warming, thought by many policy makers to be caused primarily by increases from coal-fired boilers in carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) emissions through the use of fossil fuels. Assuming limits on CO{sub 2 } emissions from coal-fired boilers are imposed in the future, the most economical CO{sub 2 } mitigation option may be efficiency improvements. Unless efficiency improvements are made in coal-fired power plants, utilities may be forced to turn to more expensive fuels or buy CO{sub 2 } credits. One way to improve the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>a</b> coal-fired power plant is to use a combined cycle involving a typical steam cycle along with <b>an</b> indirectly <b>fired</b> turbine cycle using very high-temperature but low-pressure air as the working fluid. At the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> indirectly <b>fired</b> turbine combined-cycle power system are very high-temperature heat exchangers that can produce clean air at up to 2600 F (1427 C) and 250 psi (17 bar) to turn an aeroderivative turbine. The overall system design can be very similar to that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> typical pulverized coal-fired boiler system, except that ceramics and alloys are used to carry the very high-temperature air rather than steam. This design makes the combined-cycle system especially suitable as a boiler-repowering technology. With the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gas-fired duct heater, efficiencies of 55 % can be achieved, leading to reductions in CO{sub 2 } emissions of 40 % as compared to today's coal-fired systems. On the basis of work completed to date, the high-temperature advanced furnace (HITAF) concept appears to offer a higher-efficiency technology option for coal-fired power generation systems than conventional pulverized coal firing. Concept analyses have demonstrated the ability to achieve program objectives for emissions (10 % of New Source Performance Standards, i. e., 0. 003 lb/MMBtu of particulate), efficiency (47 %- 55 %), and cost of electricity (10 %- 25 % below today's cost). Higher-efficiency technology options for new plants as well as repowering are important to the power generation industry in order to conserve valuable fossil fuel resources, reduce the quantity of pollutants (air and water) and solid wastes generated per MW, and reduce the cost of power production in a deregulated industry. Possibly more important than their potential application in a new high-temperature power system, the RAH panel and convective air heater tube bank are potential retrofit technology options for existing coal-fired boilers to improve plant efficiencies. Therefore, further development of these process air-based high-temperature heat exchangers and their potential for commercial application is directly applicable to the development of enabling technologies in support of the Vision 21 program objectives. The objective of the work documented in this report was to improve the performance of the UTRC high-temperature heat exchanger, demonstrate the fuel flexibility of the slagging combustor, and test methods for reducing corrosion of brick and castable refractory in such combustion environments. Specific technical issues of interest included measuring the effects of coatings on heat transfer in the RAH, determining the general impact <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> lower-iron bituminous coal on the operation of the RAH panel and SFS, and the development of ways to treat slag and refractories to decrease corrosion rates...|$|R
