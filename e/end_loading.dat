50|$|From 18 June 1965 {{the station}} became the {{terminus}} of a seasonal motorail service from London, the <b>end</b> <b>loading</b> dock behind the former main (Up side) platform {{being used for}} unloading the cars. Early photographs show the station building to be shorter than it is today, with the extension carried out along with refurbishment for motorail traffic. Motorail kept the station in use each summer season until the regular service ended on 19 September 1980 and the occasional peak service on 16 September 1982.|$|E

On {{the opposite side of the}} line a signal box was provided at the east (London) end of the station. The station was also provided with two <b>end</b> <b>loading</b> docks which would have been used for the horse-drawn carriages of the gentry.|$|E
40|$|Righting of two tilted {{white pine}} (Pinus strobus L.) stem leaders by {{compression}} wood formation was followed for 16 weeks.

However, special port facilities were constructed at both Preston and Larne before the new route could be opened - a wartime-built <b>end</b> <b>loading</b> ramp built by engineers during World War II at Preston, and a floating pontoon from a Mulberry harbour connected via a bridge to the quay at Larne.|$|E

50|$|New Romney and Littlestone station, {{which had}} the suffix on-sea added in 1888, was a small two-platformed {{terminus}} equipped with an equally small goods yard. The main station building was located on the down platform, while the goods shed was just to the south-west behind the platform together with coal wharves, an <b>end</b> <b>loading</b> dock, a water tower and other small buildings. In later years the up platform was hardly used other than as a livestock loading dock. In 1927, one of the sidings was extended across the road to deliver coal to the depot of the newly opened Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway (RHDR) which was to open its own New Romney station here.|$|E
50|$|Until 1892, Cowbridge used {{a decidedly}} {{non-standard}} station layout. It comprised a short runaround loop {{from which a}} number of sidings ran off. The first went to the engine turntable. From here, sidings emerged at all angles to {{various parts of the}} site. Two more sidings ran back to the engine shed, with yet more serving facilities around the yard. The main siding, having crossed the turntable, branched into three freight sidings. Three short spurs ran from the loop, serving the carriage shed, the goods shed, the cattle pens and the <b>end</b> <b>loading</b> bay. The running line continued on to terminate at a single platform, which was initially without a shelter. The original building was of red bricks with limestone quoins. Later on, a roof was extended over the platform to form a shelter.|$|E
50|$|Known as Glenelg trams, The Hs {{are a long}} {{rigid body}} tram that is <b>end</b> <b>loading</b> with a full length saloon and were built by Pengelley and Co in 1929 {{specifically}} for the Glenelg line, they commenced operations on 14 December 1929. Incredibly, 4 of the cars remained in limited heritage service on the Glenelg line {{at the start of}} 2009, nearly 80 years after they were introduced. They also saw service on the Henley North, Kensington Gardens and Cheltenham routes until their closure. They were built with Tomlinson automatic couplers and were also fitted with General Electric PC5L2 control gear and could be operated in multiple, either in pairs or until 1937, as triple car sets. After a few years in service, they were also fitted with air horns. Although specifically designed for use on the Glenelg line, the H type trams saw service from 1935 on the Henley North line and then on the Kensington line from 1952.|$|E
