2500|$|McKenna saw the universe, in {{relation}} to Novelty theory, as having a teleological attractor {{at the end of}} time, which increases interconnectedness and would eventually reach a singularity of infinite complexity. He also frequently referred to this as [...] "the transcendental object at the end of time." [...] When describing this model of the universe he stated that: [...] "The universe is not being pushed from behind. The universe is being pulled from the future toward a goal that is as inevitable as a marble reaching the bottom of a bowl when you release it up near the rim. If you do that, you know the marble will roll {{down the side of the}} bowl, down, down, down – until eventually it comes to rest at the lowest energy state, which is the bottom of the bowl. That's precisely my model of human history. I'm suggesting that the universe is pulled toward a complex attractor that exists ahead of us in time, and that our ever-accelerating speed through the phenomenal world of connectivity and novelty is based on the fact that we are now very, very close to the attractor." [...] Therefore, according to McKenna's <b>final</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the data and positioning of the graph, on December 21, 2012 we would have been in the unique position in time where maximum novelty would be experienced. An event he described as a [...] "concrescence", a [...] "tightening 'gyre'" [...] with everything flowing together. Speculating that [...] "when the laws of physics are obviated, the universe disappears, and what is left is the tightly bound plenum, the monad, able to express itself for itself, rather than only able to cast a shadow into physis as its reflection...It will be the entry of our species into 'hyperspace', but it will appear to be the end of physical laws, accompanied by the release of the mind into the imagination." ...|$|E

In contrast to most other OT approaches to language processing, we use constraints from OT semantics rather than OT syntax to address on-line comprehension. We illustrate the workings of our model by investigating the processing of coordinated structures. The psycholinguistic evidence that is currently available suggests that the on-line comprehension of coordination is influenced by constraints from many different information sources: pragmatics, discourse semantics, lexical semantics, and syntax. The model we propose formalizes this cross-modular interaction of constraints, and yields concrete predictions with respect to both intermediate parsing preferences and <b>final</b> <b>interpretations.</b> Our ultimate aim is to develop a model of processing performance {{that at the same time}} is a fully functional model of linguistic competence...|$|R

This is in contrast firstly to state-oriented specification techniques like Z and VDM, which are less mathematically tractable and so obscure the general observations we wish to make here. It is in contrast secondly to behavioural notations like CSP and CCS which, while very tractable, abstract away from issues of value or state and only describe permissible action orderings. The paper presents a generic algebra for direct manipulation interactive systems, and indicates the importance of initial and <b>final</b> <b>interpretations</b> of algebraic specifications in the iterative design process. 1 Introduction We start with the recognition that if we want to describe or specify the functional [...] ...|$|R

The neural classifier is capable of returning 3 -dimensional images outlining regions of extended targets and pinpointing the location of localised targets such as mines and pipes.

The critical items for the comprehension task consisted of object/subject garden paths (e. g. While Anna dressed the baby that was small and cute played in the crib.), and participants answered a comprehension question (e. g. Did Anna dress the baby?) following each one. Previous studies have shown that garden-path misinterpretations tend to persist into <b>final</b> <b>interpretations.</b> Results showed that both intelligence and processing speed interacted with ambiguity. Individuals with higher intelligence and faster processing were more likely to answer the comprehension questions correctly, and specifically, following ambiguous as opposed to unambiguous sentences. Inhibition produced a marginal effect, but the variance in inhibition was largely shared with intelligence. Conclusions focus on the role of individual differences in cognitive ability and their impact on syntactic ambiguity resolution...|$|R
