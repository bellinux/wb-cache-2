6000|$|It {{drew out}} her long look, and he soon enough saw why. A spasm {{came into her}} face, the tears she had already been unable to hide overflowed at first in silence, and then, as the sound {{suddenly}} comes from a child, quickened to gasps, to sobs. She sat and covered {{her face with her}} hands, giving up all attempt at a manner. [...] "It's <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> me, it's <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> me"--she caught her breath with it--"and it's as I AM, and as I must take myself, and of course it's no matter." [...] Her emotion was at first so incoherent that he could only stand there at a loss, stand with his sense of having upset her, though of having done it by the truth. He had to listen to her in a silence that he made no immediate effort to attenuate, feeling her doubly woeful amid all her dim diffused elegance; consenting to it as he had consented to the rest, and even conscious of some vague inward irony in the presence of such a fine free range of bliss and bale. He couldn't say it was NOT no matter; for he was serving her to the end, he now knew, anyway--quite as if what he thought of her {{had nothing to do with}} it. It was actually moreover as if he didn't think of her at all, as if he could think of nothing but the passion, mature, abysmal, pitiful, she represented, and the possibilities she betrayed. She was older for him to-night, visibly less exempt from the touch of time; but she was as much as ever the finest and subtlest creature, the happiest apparition, it had been given him, in all his years, to meet; and yet he could see her there as vulgarly troubled, in very truth, as a maidservant crying for her young man. The only thing was that she judged herself as the maidservant wouldn't; the weakness of which wisdom too, the dishonour of which judgement, seemed but to sink her lower. Her collapse, however, no doubt, was briefer and she had in a manner recovered herself before he intervened. [...] "Of course I'm afraid for my life. But that's nothing. It isn't that." ...|$|E
6000|$|George filled {{himself a}} bumper {{of wine and}} emptied it, and began to speak. [...] "You all of you know <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> me," [...] he said, [...] "a man without a desire to make an advance in the world: {{careless}} about reputation; {{and living in a}} garret and from hand to mouth, though I have friends and a name, and I daresay capabilities of my own, that would serve me if I had a mind. But mind I have none. I shall die in that garret most likely, and alone. I nailed myself to that doom in early life. Shall I tell you what it was that interested me about Arthur years ago, and made me inclined towards him when first I saw him? The men from our college at Oxbridge brought up accounts of that early affair with the Chatteris actress, about whom Pen has talked to me since; and who, but for the Major's generalship, might have been your daughter-in-law, ma'am. I can't see Pen in the dark, but he blushes, I'm sure; and I dare say Miss Bell does; and my friend Major Pendennis, I dare say, laughs as he ought to do--for he won. What would have been Arthur's lot now had he been tied at nineteen to an illiterate woman older than himself, with no qualities in common between them to make one a companion for the other, no equality, no confidence, and no love speedily? What could he have been but most miserable? And when he spoke just now and threatened a similar union, be sure it was but a threat occasioned by anger, which you must give me leave to say, ma'am, was very natural on his part, for after a generous and manly conduct--let me say who know the circumstances well--most generous and manly and self-denying (which is rare with him),--he has met from some friends of his with a most unkind suspicion, and has had to complain of the unfair treatment of another innocent person, towards whom he and you all are under much obligation." ...|$|E

5000|$|Sharon Gannon (born July 4, 1951 in Washington, D.C.) is a yoga teacher, {{animal rights}} advocate, musician, author, dancer/choreographer and painter. Along with David Life, {{she is the}} co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the {{exponential}} rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century. The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species. The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students {{that they must be}} willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy. Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included. Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures. This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it. If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views. When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others. You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances. According to Gannon: [...] "How you treat others will determine how others treat you. How others treat you will determine <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> yourself. <b>How</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> yourself will determine who you are." ...|$|E

[...] When he was twelve years old, his parents split up, an event which he later described as [...] "my whole life falling down in front of me. The relationship between your parents is <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> the world at that age. You learn not to trust anything." [...] Bickers would often cite this event as contributing to his later personal vulnerability and his consequent reactions to both people and to band politics.|$|E

It is dedicated to [...] "[...] [...] {{those of you who}} may assume what is real.", and based on his belief that, [...] "Student knowledge {{is the beginning of the}} worlds wisdom.".In a plea to clarify those issues related to a personal inclusivity of ones own reflective thought, Antón's essay published by the Hispanic Research Center's Latina/o Art Community asserts, [...] "It is crucial to understand that you must add a part of yourself to all that you see for learning to take place. Learning, not in what you see, but in <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>see.</b> Whatever you approach, whatever mysteries there are, all of them will need you as a vital pat of their unfolding.

The film travels {{in and out of}} the lives of a number of different characters as each one connects to the next during their most pivotal moments. It began its festival run in 2016 and was picked up for distribution by Turn Key Films in 2017. During its festival run, the film won multiple Best Film awards as well as awards for Best Screenplay, Audience Award, and various awards for its castmembers. The film also garnered additional nominations for Best Film and a variety of acting roles. The score was written by Steven Grove and the soundtrack consists of songs from Greg Laswell, Cary Brothers, Jack the Radio, Day at the Fair, Buddy (band), Tom Rosenthal (musician), Butterfly Boucher, and other indie artists from around the world. It was released in the United States and the United Kingdom via Flix Premiere in July of 2017.

His dad is {{obviously}} a tyrant and he dictated over his countrymen through fear but Saadi was never like that. He was always friendly and polite. When he bought his house in Hampstead he asked me what I thought of it. He even came to my wedding. Obviously he used to have parties and stuff and he would invite me to Cannes to watch the Grand Prix. For his birthday he would fly me over on his plane. People who don’t know him might say he’s like this or like that or like his dad, but I’ve never seen that. I looked at him like a friend. He wasn't the best footballer but he did it as a hobby. He's a billionaire but it was something he wanted to do. He wanted to play football, to come in every day and train. And he did it, to be fair. He never expected any special treatment. But obviously there were his bodyguards around. It is very strange for me. People will say to me, 'how can you be friends with this guy?' But you can only judge people on <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> them. He was always nice to me. I never met his brothers or his dad, they must be completely different. It has been weird. He paid for my honeymoon. He asked me what we were doing for it and I told him we hadn’t decided yet. So he said he’d sort something out for me. He paid for us to go to LA for a week and then on to Hawaii. All first-class travel and top hotels. It was very generous. That's the side I see of him. I don’t see the other side. I don’t know it. There's always corruption where there's power, so you never know. His country want him back to prosecute him but they want to kill him apparently. It's all politics and I don’t really know about it.
