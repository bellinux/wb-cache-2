The model is useful for mapping industrial activities and comparing them with corresponding systems in industrialised countries. The figures presented in this paper serve as a frame of reference. The main reason for realising clean and sustainable production systems in industrialised countries is the very strict environmental legislation and control systems.

Exergy losses {{can be related to}} the energy flows during dynamic processes, and exergy conversion in these processes provides a meaningful measure of the industrial ecosystem efficiency. The results are expected to help make transportation systems more sustainable. Potentially beneficial directions for future research are highlighted...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{some aspects}} of energy conversion processes during underground electric train operation. Energy conversion processes are explained using exergy, {{in order to support}} transport system sustainability. Loss of exergy reflects a loss of potential of energy to do work. Following the notion that life in Nature demonstrates sustainable energy conversion, we approach the sustainability of urban transportation systems according to the model of an ecosystem. The presentation steps based on an <b>industrial</b> ecosystem <b>metabolism</b> include describing the urban electric railway system as an industrial ecosystem with its limits and components, defining system operation regimes, and assessing the equilibrium points of the system for two reference frames. For an electric train, exergy losses can be related to the energy flows during dynamic processes, and exergy conversion in these processes provides a meaningful measure of the industrial (i. e., transportation) ecosystem efficiency. As a validation of the theoretical results, a case study is analyzed for three underground urban electric train types REU-U, REU-M, REU-G operating in the Bucharest Underground Railway System (METROREX). The main experimental results are presented and processed, and relevant diagrams are constructed. It is determined that there is great potential for improving the performance of rail systems and increasing their sustainability. For instance, power converters and efficient anti-skid systems can ensure optimum traction and minimum electricity use, and the recovered energy in electric braking can be used by other underground trains, increasing exergy efficiency, although caution must be exercised when doing so to avoid reducing the efficiency of the overall system. urban electric transportation; sustainability; electric train; energy conversion; exergy; induction motor; industrial ecology...|$|R

The promotion {{of nuclear energy}} as a clean alternative and the projected increase of electricity demand {{in countries such as}} China and India, have led to a global “uranium rush”, unseen since the peak of the Cold War. This article studies the formation of the expanding nuclear frontier looking at the interaction between the global uranium <b>metabolism,</b> <b>industrial</b> dynamics and local ecologies of resistance using Namibia as a case-study. Namibia, the world´s fourth largest producer of uranium, stands at the frontier of this rush with sixty-six recently granted prospecting licenses that could turn into mines, compared to only three currently operating mines. We focus on three generic attributes that help to explain the emergence and intensity of resistance by local communities to uranium mining: the ecology and geography of the resource; the degree and type of political and economic marginalization of the community; and crucially, the connection and integration of local concerns with broader social movements and political demands. We show with the use of empirical material how these factors play out differently in five Namibian communities that have been, or stand to be, affected by uranium mining, and explain how local ecologies of resistance shape the global uranium rush...|$|R

Food waste related resource use and environmental pollution {{can no longer be}} justified in the context of global warming and increasing pressure on the planet’s limited boundaries. Cities today are acting as laboratories for socio-technological innovations in food waste prevention and valorization, yet coherent concepts and strategies involving the different actors are miss-ing. This work aims to: i) review high potential socio-technological innovations in food waste prevention and valorization ii) extract research questions contributing to fostering and accompanying cities’ breakthrough strategies towards zero waste sustainable food sys-tems, specific to different urban settings worldwide (covering both industrialized and unindustrialized areas). Twenty experts related to disciplines of <b>industrial</b> ecology, urban <b>metabolism,</b> urban farming, aquaculture systems, waste recovery, food science, law, eth-ics, system innovation and foresight studies were organized as a working group follow-ing a foresight study approach. Expert panel and literature review have shown that in-novative approaches in urban food waste prevention and management are abundantly experimented in a lot of cities worldwide (for example in Canada, the USA, UK, France and other European countries). They use manifold tools (regulation, technology, social innovation etc.) both in food waste prevention and valorization. Food system actors involved are as different as business and catering companies, civil society, NGOs and municipalities. Experts have identified 9 main categories for socio-technological innova-tions: 1) Education of public and training of professionals 2) Simplification of supply chain specifications, 3) Collaborative use of data, flow monitoring and smart sensors, 4) Regulation, taxation and financial tools, 5) Gradual withdrawal of food from market, selling off, stock clearance, on-site processing and donations, 6) Breakthrough manufac-turing and packaging technologies, 7) Urban practices such as shared gardens, swapping and food give-and-take, 8) Biomass valorization and biorefinery, 9) Good Samaritan law and distribution of responsibility between stakeholders. 	 These nine innovative approaches are discussed on the base of their expected high im-pact potential and transferability. Most of them are new, tested small-scale and have not yet been subject of in-depth analysis of performances, forces and drawbacks. Techno-logical and cultural challenges remain to be overcome, for example the analysis of “big data” to support alignment of supply and demand, the mutual share of information and joint planning of food supply, and societal acceptance of new technologies. Overall, data on food waste flows in cities are challenging to obtain.

5000|$|Anthropogenic metabolism, also {{referred}} to as 'metabolism of the anthroposphere', is a term used in industrial ecology, material flow analysis, and waste management to describe the material and energy turnover of human society. It emerges from the application of systems thinking to the industrial and other man-made activities and it is a central concept of sustainable development. In modern societies, the bulk of anthropogenic (man-made) material flows is related to one of the following activities: sanitation, transportation, habitation, and communication, which were [...] "of little metabolic significance in prehistoric times". Global man-made stocks of steel in buildings, infrastructure, and vehicles, for example, amount to about 25 Gigatonnes (more than three tonnes per person), a figure that is surpassed only by construction materials such as concrete.Sustainable development is closely linked to the design of a sustainable anthropogenic metabolism, which will entail substantial changes in the energy and material turnover of the different human activities.

This approach is relevant because a multidisciplinary approach is followed in implementing industrial ecology. Because of its multidisciplinary character, the field that is covered by industrial ecology has been gradually extended to domains beyond its original concepts. Therefore, it might be useful to redefine industrial ecology while reconsidering the original definitions of this topic. The essential aspect in which industrial ecology differs from other approaches is in the comparison between the industrial system and the naturaJ ecological system. This comparison is not only of academic interest, but it is considered a tooI for the redesign of the industrial system on various levels of aggregation aimed at achieving i. ncreased sust. linability.

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on {{empirical}} research on a taxonomy of technological environmental innovations. It draws on a databank with over 500 examples of new technologies (materials, products, processes and practices) which come with benign environmental effects. The approaches applied to interpreting the datasets are innovation life cycle analysis, and product chain analysis. Main results include the following: 1. Innovations merely aimed at eco-efficienc y do in most cases not represent significant contributions to improving {{the properties of the}} <b>industrial</b> <b>metabolism.</b> This can better be achieved by technologies that fulfill the criteria of eco-consistency (metabolic consistency), also called eco-effectiveness. 2. Ecological pressure of a technology is basically determined by its conceptual make-up and design. Most promising thus are technologies in earlier rather than later stages of their life cycle (i. e. during R&D and customisation in growing numbers), because it is during the stages before reaching the inflection point and maturity in a learning curve where technological environmental innovations can best contribute to improving ecological consistency of the <b>industrial</b> <b>metabolism</b> {{while at the same time}} delivering their maximum increase in efficiency as well. 3. Moreover, environmental action needs to focus on early steps in the vertical manufacturing chain rather than on those in the end. Most of the ecological pressure of a technology is no rmally not caused end-of-chain in use or consumption, but in the more basic steps of the manufacturing chain (with the exception of products the use of which consumes energy, e. g. vehicles, appliances). There are conclusions to be drawn for refocusing attention from downstream to upstream in life cycles and product chains, and for a shift of emphasis in environmental policy from regulation to innovation. Ambitious environmental standards, though, continue to be an important regulative precondition of ecologically benign technological innovation.

40|$|The {{object of}} this report is to {{demonstrate}} the merit of studies in <b>industrial</b> <b>metabolism</b> as a new analytical tool for assessing the sources and flows of toxic chemicals. The methodology provides a framework for "cradle-to-grave" analysis that traces the movement of chemicals through the industrial economy, identifies the entry points through which they pass from the economy to the environment, and assesses their impact once they have entered the environment. The analysis is guided throughout by the simple constraint imposed by the principle of mass balance, which requires that {{the sum total of}} a chemical remains constant as it moves through a system from production to consumption to disposal, even as the partitioning of the chemical into various economic streams changes. Much of the analysis in this report is focused on the Rhine River Basin. The authors suggest that the spatial unit of large river basins may be ideal for studies in <b>industrial</b> <b>metabolism.</b> By definition, a river basin encompasses the land area that drains into the rivers or its tributaries. Thus, if one accounts for movements of materials into or out of the basin (particularly via atmospheric transport), it may be assumed that emissions generated within the basin can be lost from the basin only by river transport and discharge at its mouth. The remainder of the emissions (equal to total emissions minus the output from the basin) is deposited in and spatially bound by the basin, accumulating in chemical sinks, including agricultural soils, ground waters, sediments of lakes and tributaries, and landfills and toxic waste dumps. Mass balance analysis ensures that these sinks are accounted for and provides boundary conditions for assessing cumulative loads. Moreover, the tracing of chemical flows, both in the economy and environment occurs within the same spatial domain, and linkages between sources and their environmental effects are more easily established...|$|E

Data on specific indicators of environmental pressure (i. e., the throughput of materials, energy and the volume of transport) in 19 countries have been used to investigate patterns of delinking.

40|$|The {{sustainability}} of Western Australia’s economy, society and environment is fundamentally affected by <b>industrial</b> <b>metabolism</b> and associated induced resource flows. Several indicators of Australia’s resource economy suggest that massive dematerialisation, decarbonisation, and detoxification of industrial material flows {{will need to}} begin {{in the near future}} if the resource economy is to become sustainable in the longer term. The paper examines industrial ecology in its potential to inform and deliver the necessary restructuring of Australia’s <b>industrial</b> <b>metabolism</b> along a sustainable trajectory of development. In this sense, the Kwinana industrial area in Western Australia is recognised as an internationally significant example of industrial symbioses. Contributions to industrial efficiency have occurred through the evolutionary development of a complex resource exchange network involving at least 28 heavy industries in the Kwinana industrial strip. The Kwinana resource exchange network is compared with a well documented though smaller example of industrial symbioses involving 8 industries in Kalundborg, Denmark. Industrial ecology in its manifestation as industrial synergy is critiqued in its capacity to provide a platform for sustainable industrial development. The establishment of resource exchange networks among industrial firms has contributed significantly to energy and resource efficiency at the industrial firm or estate level, however the Jevons’ Paradox informs that while component efficiency may be a characteristic of a sustainable materials economy, it does not provide a means to get there. Industrial synergy in this sense may in fact promote unsustainable path dependant development, and is an inadequate vehicle for the delivery of industrial sustainability outcomes at the broader level of <b>industrial</b> <b>metabolism.</b> Demand-side management at various stages of the industrial materials economy is briefly explored as a policy option addressing overall system efficiency while also driving the desirable efficiency of industrial metabolic components such as the industrial firm. In advocating industrial symbioses, the ecological metaphor employed by industrial ecologists is largely informed by a reductionist and mechanistic understanding of isolated components of natural systems. This paper explores a deeper more holistic understanding of the organisation and development of ecological systems, drawing particularly from the self-organising system models described by Gaian ecology. The ecological metaphor in this reviewed and expanded sense is applied to the organisational system dynamics of industrial economics and development institutions, informing a potentially more robust model for the sustainable development of industrial systems. The region of Kwinana -Rockingham is referred to as a significant evolving example of institutional and organisational ecology among industrial development stakeholders. Cooperation, information transfer and capacity building between industry, community, and the public sector represents a more powerful articulation of industrial ecology, and potentially provides a powerful vehicle for the delivery of industrial sustainability outcomes on a regional and regulatory level. A collaborative and ecological industrial development process allowing broad participation and emphasising the development of human capital is suggested as a significant and pragmatic contribution to the broader industrial sustainability agenda...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable {{development}} presents important {{challenges to}} environmental research, such as developing perspectives and methods that clarify {{the links between}} societal activities, resource use, and pollution. With this challenge in mind, this book presents examples of the <b>industrial</b> <b>metabolism</b> approach to analyzing regional environmental change and discusses the problems of combining economic restructuring with environmental cleanup. The book is based on two IIASA projects focused on environmental development in two regions of Central Europe: the Rhine Basin and the Black Triangle-Upper Silesia region. Among the most important contributions from these research efforts are the analysis of flows and pollution from both a historical and geographical perspective, and {{the combination of these}} studies with analyses of the regions' social and institutional development. The <b>industrial</b> <b>metabolism</b> approach is introduced and discussed through different types of studies. Historical studies of heavy metals in Europe are used for illustration and for discussing how spatial patterns of emissions and deposition have changed over time. The development of the Rhine Basin provides an example of the shift in pollution trends that has taken place in many OECD countries during the past few decades. The environmental risk analysis of the Eastern European region focuses in particular on problems of heavy metal pollution of soils. A flow approach has been used to estimate the emissions and deposition of heavy metals (cadmium, lead, zinc) over the past 40 years, and the future risks of accumulated pollution a re analyzed. In combination with flow and scenario studies, studies of social, economic, and political developments relevant to environmental development form the basis of a more general analysis of the problems related to the future development of the environment in Central Europe. This book is written for researchers and students with an interest in regional development, environmental studies, transdisciplinary research, or Central Europe. The many overviews and illustrations are indeed to provoke discussion about social and environmental development, environmental policies, and study methods. This book provides a valuable framework for seminars and courses in various disciplines...|$|E

Both agroecosystems are complementary and representative of a diverse territory. We have applied the methodology of nutrient balances to the first one of these cases {{in order to assess}} its sustainability in the long term regarding the management of soil fertility. Results confirm a similar evolution to other case studies within Europe in terms of soil exhaustion and nutrient imbalances {{towards the end of the}} 19 th century after a long process of agricultural intensification. This metabolic rift has been connected with the general agrarian crisis that affected the continent at this point, and with the process of socioecological transition from an organic into an <b>industrial</b> <b>metabolism...</b>|$|E

Throughput is categorized as stored, transformed, or passive for the major flow modes. The aggregate, fuel, food, water, and air cycles are all examined. Emphasis is placed on atmospheric pathways because the data are abundant. Relevant models of urban energy and material flows, demogra-phy, and atmospheric chemistry are discussed. Earth system–level loops from cities to neighboring ecosystems are identified. Megacities are somewhat independent of their immediate environment for food, fuel, and aggregate inputs, but all are constrained by their regional environment for supplying water and absorbing wastes. We elaborate on analogies with biological metabolism and ecosystem succession as useful concep-tual frameworks for addressing urban ecological problems. We conclude that whereas data are numerous for some individual cities, cross-cutting compilations are lacking in biogeochemical analysis and modeling. Synthesis of the existing information wil...|$|E
