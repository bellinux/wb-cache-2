It is also known in America as the rainbow finch, Gould's finch, or the Lady <b>Gouldian</b> <b>finch</b> (although Mrs. Gould did not hold the title lady). In Australia, it is predominantly called the <b>Gouldian</b> <b>finch.</b> It {{is a member of}} the weaver-finch family Estrildidae, which is sometimes considered a subfamily of Passeridae.|$|E
25|$|Recovery {{plans are}} in place to recover and {{conserve}} its natural habitats, such as building protective fencing to prevent damage by cattle, research on wildfires and their effects on Gouldian population and constructing artificial nest boxes {{in order to provide}} more nesting locations for wild pairs. Attempts at reintroduction have so far proved unsuccessful. It was also suggested to develop management guidelines for land-holders about appropriate land management, promoting the recovery program, and <b>Gouldian</b> <b>finch</b> conservation.|$|E
25|$|Like other finches, the <b>Gouldian</b> <b>finch</b> is a seed eater. During the {{breeding}} season, Gouldian finches feed mostly on ripe or half-ripe grass seeds of sorghum. During the dry season, they forage {{on the ground}} for fallen seed. During the wet season, spinifex grass seed (Triodia sp.) is an important component of their diet. So far Gouldians have been recorded as consuming six different species of grass seed, but during crop analysis, researchers have yet to find evidence of insect consumption.|$|E

2500|$|In the Kimberley District of Western Australia, {{where most}} wild <b>Gouldian</b> <b>finch</b> were trapped for aviculture, {{it was often}} {{reported}} {{as one of the}} more common of the eleven finch species. [...] Until 1977, it was trapped in greater numbers than any other finch. [...] From 1897, when finch trapping started in the Kimberley, it was the most sought after finch by trappers and the most desired by fanciers. [...] Between the years 1934 and 1939, the <b>Gouldian</b> <b>finch</b> was the most exported single finch species. [...] The Perth Zoo exported 22,064 finches of which 12,509 were Gouldian. [...] Private dealers exported 35,315 finches, of which 14,504 [...] were Gouldian. [...] The number of finches taken in the 1958 finch trapping season was the largest for one year, of the 38,649 finches taken, 11,286 were Gouldian. [...] The last licensed trapping of <b>Gouldian</b> <b>finch</b> in Western Australia was on 15 November 1981. [...] In that year's finch trapping season, of the 23,450 finches taken 1,054 were Gouldian.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Gouldian</b> <b>finch</b> (Erythrura gouldiae), {{also known}} as the Lady <b>Gouldian</b> <b>finch,</b> Gould's finch or the rainbow finch, is a {{colourful}} passerine bird endemic to Australia. There is strong evidence of a continuing decline, even at the best-known site near Katherine in the Northern Territory. Large numbers are bred in captivity, particularly in Australia. In the state of South Australia, National Parks & Wildlife Department permit returns in the late 1990s showed that over 13,000 Gouldian finches were being kept by aviculturists. If extrapolated to an Australia-wide figure this would result in a total of over 100,000 birds. In 1992, it was classified as [...] "endangered in the wild" [...] under IUCN's criteria C2ai. This was because the viable population size was estimated to be less than 2,500 mature individuals, no permanent subpopulation was known to contain more than 250 mature individuals, and that a continuing decline was observed in the number of mature individuals. It is currently subject to a conservation program.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} <b>Gouldian</b> <b>finches</b> has {{decreased}} quite dramatically during the 20th century. Their habitat {{has been reduced}} or altered. Early research indicated a parasite called the air sac mite {{was responsible for the}} decline of the species. This is no longer considered to be a major factor. In general, <b>Gouldian</b> <b>finches</b> are susceptible to diseases and viral infections. Their beautiful colours mean that they are easily caught by predators. Fires are listed as the primary threat to the natural populations. The total number of <b>Gouldian</b> <b>finches</b> altogether is not low, however, because they are among the most popular pet birds, and are bred in captivity for the pet trade.|$|R

40|$|Determining the {{relative}} access {{of a species}} to critical limiting resources requires knowledge of the spectrum of their resource utilisation (niche space) and that of potential competitors, and the frequency distribution of resources in the environment. We used this theoretical framework to assess {{the relative}} access to nesting sites {{and the potential for}} interspecific competition between two sympatric cavity-nesting <b>finches.</b> <b>Gouldian</b> (Erythrura gouldiae) and Long-tailed (Poephila acuticauda) Finches are both estrildid finches with similar ecological requirements, gross morphology and geographical ranges. By measuring the characteristics of all tree-cavities in an area of breeding habitat, and identifying those used by each of the two species, we were able to quantify the relationship between total available variation and variation in use by <b>Gouldian</b> and Long-tailed <b>Finches.</b> Using a likelihood-based method, we found that Longtailed Finches exhibited a broader niche than <b>Gouldian</b> <b>Finches</b> with respect to available variation, and that these niches overlapped. Using these data we estimated that the effective availability of suitable nesting sites for Long-tailed Finches was 38 % greater than for <b>Gouldian</b> <b>Finches.</b> Their relatively specialised niche and overlap with a more generalist competitor has the potential to constrain reproduction for <b>Gouldian</b> <b>Finches,</b> and will have implications for the conservation of remaining populations of this endangered species. 8 page(s...|$|R

30|$|Although {{fire effects}} were detected, these were muted within current fire regimes {{experienced}} in the region, and {{it is unlikely that}} appreciable impacts would occur on S. stipoideum seed availability to <b>Gouldian</b> <b>finches</b> while breeding. However, reduced seed density resulting from repeated high intensity fires could lead to exacerbation of food shortages postulated for <b>Gouldian</b> <b>finches</b> in the late dry season, as seeds naturally become scarce at the soil surface where finches forage. Early dry season fires maximize Sorghum spp. seed abundance. These findings support the implementation of low intensity early dry season burning to promote optimal food and breeding resources for threatened finches.|$|R

40|$|Genetic {{compatibility}} may drive individual mate choice decisions {{because of}} predictable fitness effects associated with breeding with incompatible partners. In <b>Gouldian</b> <b>finches</b> (Erythrura gouldiae), females paired with genetically incompatible males of alternative color morphs overproduce sons, presumably to reduce investment in inviable daughters. We also observed a reduced overall investment in clutch size, egg size, and care to offspring resulting from incompatible matings. Within-female experimental pairings demonstrate that female birds {{have the ability}} to adaptively adjust the sex of their eggs and allocate resources on the basis of partner quality. Female <b>Gouldian</b> <b>finches</b> thus make cumulative strategic allocation decisions to minimize the costs of poor-quality pairings when faced with a genetically incompatible partner. 3 page(s...|$|R

25|$|<b>Gouldian</b> <b>finches</b> {{will usually}} make their nests in tree-holes, {{generally}} within a kilometer {{or so of}} water. They usually breed {{in the early part}} of the dry season, when there is plenty of food around. The male courtship dance is a fascinating spectacle. When a male is courting a female, he bobs about ruffling his feathers to show off his colors. He expands his chest and fluffs out his forehead feathers. After mating, a female lays a clutch of about 4–8 eggs. Both parents help brood the eggs during the daytime, and the female stays on the eggs at night. When the eggs hatch, both parents help care for the young. <b>Gouldian</b> <b>finches</b> leave the nest at between 19 and 23 days and are independent at 40 days old.|$|R
