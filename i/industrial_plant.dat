25|$|Population {{decline from}} 1950–1990 {{was due to}} a string of <b>industrial</b> <b>plant</b> closures. Plants such as Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Allegany Munitions and Celanese closed down and {{relocated}} as part of widespread industrial restructuring after WWII. The 1987 closure of the Kelly Springfield Tire Plant marked a turning point, {{as it was the}} last major manufacturing plant in the city limits to close its doors.|$|E
25|$|A similar problem {{occurs as}} BOD {{concentrations}} drop when low flow increases waste residence time within the secondary treatment bioreactor. Secondary treatment ecosystems of college communities acclimated to waste loading fluctuations from student work/sleep cycles {{may have difficulty}} surviving school vacations. Secondary treatment systems accustomed to routine production cycles of industrial facilities may have difficulty surviving <b>industrial</b> <b>plant</b> shutdown. Populations of species feeding on incoming waste initially decline as concentration of those food sources decrease. Population decline continues as ecosystem predator populations compete for a declining population of lower trophic level organisms.|$|E

25|$|The River Rouge Complex of Ford Motor Company was the world’s {{most famous}} <b>industrial</b> <b>plant.</b> As WWII approached, Ford offered its {{training}} capabilities to the Navy, and in January 1941, the Naval Service Training School at the Rouge Complex was opened.

Having a certain mechanical genius, he was able to imagine profitable new technologies. With the growth of the peach orchards, he started the Marvil Package Company, a basket and crate manufacturing business in Laurel. For a time, it was said to have been the largest <b>industrial</b> <b>plant</b> in the area, producing two million fruit baskets and crates annually. He was also the publisher of Laurel's first newspaper, the Gazette, which he started in 1889.|$|E

25|$|The Nixon administration, {{looking for}} a way out, pursued a less {{restrained}} course under the brief but devastating Operation Linebacker and Operation Linebacker II bombing raids. These attacks removed many of the restrictions upon previous American targeting, seeded Northern waters with mines that cut Soviet and Chinese imports to a trickle, exhausted national air-defenses and crippled whatever significant remaining <b>industrial</b> <b>plant</b> and transportation network was left in the North. LINEBACKER caused more damage to Northern lines of communication, than the previous 3 years of ROLLING THUNDER, particularly as the Easter Offensive brought communist forces out into the open.|$|E
25|$|During its {{period as}} part of Brooklyn's Eastern District, the area {{achieved}} remarkable industrial, cultural, and economic growth, and local businesses thrived. Wealthy New Yorkers such as Cornelius Vanderbilt and railroad magnate Jubilee Jim Fisk built shore-side mansions. Charles Pratt and his family founded the Pratt Institute, the great school of art & architecture, and the Astral Oil Works, which later became part of Standard Oil. Corning Glass Works was founded here before moving upstate to Corning, New York. German immigrant, chemist Charles Pfizer founded Pfizer Pharmaceutical in Williamsburg, and the company maintained an <b>industrial</b> <b>plant</b> in the neighborhood through 2007, although its headquarters were moved to Manhattan in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|As an {{alternative}} to TRUEX, an extraction process using a malondiamide has been devised. The DIAMEX (DIAMideEXtraction) process {{has the advantage of}} avoiding the formation of organic waste which contains elements other than carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. Such an organic waste can be burned without the formation of acidic gases which could contribute to acid rain (although the acidic gases could be recovered by a scrubber). The DIAMEX process is being worked on in Europe by the French CEA. The process is sufficiently mature that an <b>industrial</b> <b>plant</b> could be constructed with the existing knowledge of the process. In common with PUREX this process operates by a solvation mechanism.|$|E

25|$|The Illinois Central Railroad began {{construction}} of their largest locomotive workshop at Paducah in 1924. Over {{a period of}} 190 days, a large ravine between Washington and Jones Streets was filled with 44,560 carloads of dirt to enlarge the site to include 23 buildings. The eleven million dollar project was completed in 1927 as the fourth largest <b>industrial</b> <b>plant</b> in Kentucky. It became the largest employer in Paducah with 1,075 employees in 1938. The Paducah shops were converted to maintain diesel locomotives as steam locomotives were replaced through the 1940s and 1950s; and a nationally known rebuilding program for aging diesel locomotives from Illinois Central and other railroads began in 1967. The shops {{became part of the}} Paducah and Louisville Railway in 1986; and are operated by VMV Paducahbilt.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet armies {{were in a}} poor {{state after}} the catastrophes of Uman and Kiev, and could offer only {{sporadic}} resistance, but the German advance was slowed by the autumn rains and the Soviet scorched earth policy, which denied the Germans food and fuel and forced them to rely on overstretched lines of supply. Rundstedt's armies were also weakened by the transfer of units back to Army Group Centre {{to take part in}} the attack on Moscow (Operation Typhoon). Reichenau did not take Kharkov until 24 October. Nevertheless, during October Rundstedt's forces won another great victory when Manstein and Kleist's tanks reached the Sea of Azov, trapping two Soviet Armies around Mariupol and taking over 100,000 prisoners. This victory enabled Manstein to undertake the conquest of the Crimea (apart from the fortress city of Sevastopol) against only weak opposition, while Kleist advanced towards Rostov. Despite these defeats, the Red Army was able to fall back on the Don in reasonably good order, and also to evacuate much of the <b>industrial</b> <b>plant</b> of the Donbass.|$|E
500|$|In 1923, Brundage {{constructed}} a massive assembly plant on Torrence Avenue on Chicago's South Side for the Ford Motor Company. At $4million in cost and bringing [...] under one roof, {{it was the}} largest <b>industrial</b> <b>plant</b> built by Brundage. Constructed in ten months, the new facility helped meet the national demand for ModelT cars in the 1920s, and in 1950, produced 154,244 vehicles. A plant for Hubbard & Co. was erected in 125 days despite an unusually harsh Chicago winter. Despite later statements from Brundage that he avoided public works due to corruption, he built the 23rd Street viaduct as part of the South Shore Development project; Brundage's viaduct extended Chicago's shoreline into Lake Michigan at a cost of two million dollars. By 1925, the Avery Brundage Company was acclaimed for speed, innovation and quality, and had a payroll of $50,000 a week.|$|E
