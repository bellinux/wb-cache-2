5|$|As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> to {{find and}} kill, the quagga was hunted by early Dutch {{settlers}} and later by Afrikaners to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or used locally. The quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its limited distribution, {{and it may have}} competed with domestic livestock for forage. The quagga had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, in the Orange Free State, was extirpated in the late 1870s. The last known wild individual died in 1878.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} there was {{confusion}} between B.verticillata and B.littoralis (swamp banksia).

Thus <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> to perceive B.verticillata as falling {{within the range of}} variation of this broadly defined species. The confusion was largely cleared up once B.seminuda was recognised as a distinct taxon.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{complained of}} the game's high price, which was {{nearly double the}} average. Crash {{wondered}} if the cost might lead to more piracy.

5|$|The idea of {{reforming}} the Commonwealth gained traction from the mid-17th century; it was however viewed with suspicion {{not only by}} its magnates but also by neighboring countries, which had been content with {{the deterioration of the}} Commonwealth and abhorred the thought of a resurgent and democratic power on their borders.

5|$|A {{survey of}} 1000 {{secondary}} school pupils and university students in Tayside conducted in February 2010 found 20% {{of them had}} previously taken mephedrone. Although {{at the time it}} was available legally over the internet, only 10% of users reported purchasing it online, with most purchasing it from street dealers. Of those who had used mephedrone, 97% said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> or very easy to obtain. Around 50% of users reported at least one negative effect associated with the use of mephedrone, of which teeth grinding is the most common. Detailed interviews with users in Northern Ireland similarly found that few purchased mephedrone online, with most interviewees citing concerns that their address would be traced or that family members could intercept the package.|$|E
5|$|Voss {{was one of}} {{the test}} pilots for the F.I triplane {{prototype}} which developed into the Fokker Dr.I. He was summoned to Schwerin, and on 5 July 1917 {{was one of the}} first pilots to test fly Fokker F.I s/n 103/17. Although the Fokker had some drawbacks, such as its low speed and slowness in a dive, Voss loved the new craft. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> to fly with light controls, could out-manoeuvre any previous aircraft, mounted twin machine guns, and had a rapid rate of climb. The same climbing ability that put it at 1,000 meters (3,000 feet) within three minutes of takeoff lent itself to the combat tactic of zooming upwards out of combat to gain the height advantage on opponents. Voss enthusiastically recommended the Fokker's adoption while never progressing to testing the Pfalz Dr.I. He left Schwerin with an assignment for command of another jasta.|$|E
5|$|When first {{described}} by the naturalist George Perry in 1810, the brolga was misclassified as a species of Ardea, the genus that includes the herons and egrets. It {{is in fact a}} member of the Gruiformes—the order that includes the crakes, rails, and cranes, {{and a member of the}} genus Antigone. The ornithologist John Gould used the name Grus australasianus when he wrote about it and noted it to be widespread in the north and east of Australia. He also recorded that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> to tame, and that James Macarthur had kept a pair at his home in Camden. Calling it the Australian Crane, he mentioned that its early colonial name had been Native Companion. The Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union made brolga, a popular name derived from Gamilaraay burralga, the official name for the bird in 1926.|$|E

5|$|The Llanbadarn tithes {{were not}} easy to collect: both the {{fishermen}} and the farmers of north Cardiganshire strongly resented the payments {{they had to make}} in goods, while the goods themselves (fish, corn, farm stock etc.) were {{not easy to}} collect and had to be sold for the money to pass to the Chichesters. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> for agents and collectors to line their own pockets, and {{to take advantage of the}} now-widowed Catherine by withholding their accounts. In 1727, she travelled to Cardiganshire by herself to claim her legal rights and stayed over winter. She then had to do so again in 1730: all her efforts were met with blank refusals and lies. During her long periods of forced residence she witnessed the beaching of ninety porpoises at Aberystwyth which were slaughtered by the local people. Her final journey to Wales in 1734 proved fatal, and she died in the county: a slate memorial to her is still to be seen above the vestry door in Llanbadarn church.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} the final {{production}} and release of the Thanhouser Company and {{it was to be}} released through Pathé. Numerous factors would play into the winding down and eventual closing of the Thanhouser Film Corporation with much advance notice by Edwin Thanhouser. Q. David Bowers writes that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> to understand Thanhouser's decision to retire due to numerous aspects including that releases through Pathé were based on their decision to release or discard the work, the New Rochelle studio was 2,500 miles {{from the center of the}} trade activity and the slump in industry tied to World War I. Weeks before the film was released, Variety told of the winding down of the Thanhouser with the studio's staff consisting of Edwin Thanhouser and the bookkeeper, Jessie B. Bishop. The article concluded with the announcement that Lloyd F. Lonergan, the scenario writer of the company, had retired from the company. As it wound down, the Thanhouser Company was announced to have no liabilities would close with a positive bank balance. Little is known of the production of this final film, but it was directed by Emile Chautard from a scenario written by Lloyd F. Lonergan. The cameraman was Jacques Bizeul.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Robert Wexler of Abbott Laboratories {{developed}} the Analgizer, a disposable inhaler {{that allowed the}} self-administration of methoxyflurane vapor in air for analgesia. The Analgizer consisted of a polyethylene cylinder 5inches long and 1inch in diameter with a 1inch long mouthpiece. The device contained a rolled wick of polypropylene felt which held 15milliliters of methoxyflurane. Because of {{the simplicity of the}} Analgizer and the pharmacological characteristics of methoxyflurane, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of conscious analgesia which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary {{over a period of time}} lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly amnesic to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary. The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with bone fractures and joint dislocations, and for dressing changes on burn patients. When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent adverse effect on Apgar scores. All vital signs remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients. The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and sedation until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today. The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the Penthrox inhaler. Trials of methoxyflurane as an analgesic in emergency medicine are going on in the UK.|$|E
