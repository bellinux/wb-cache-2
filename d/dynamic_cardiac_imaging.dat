40|$|Our goal is {{to develop}} a single-photon {{emission}} computed tomography (SPECT) system for <b>dynamic</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>imaging</b> so that heart disease may be more accurately evaluated. We have developed multiple, stationary, modular scintillation cameras that allow for dynamic imaging because of large detector area, large collection efficiency, high count-rate capability, and no motion of detector, collimator, or aperture. We make use of coded-aperture pinhole arrays because they increase photon-collection efficiency. The coded apertures allow for overlapping projections or multiplexing of an object onto the detector face. We have designed a novel collimation system that allows for an increased number of pinhole projections without substantial multiplexing. This new method is called "subslicing". We verified the subslice concept both in computer simulation and with our 16 -module ring imaging system. Comparison of results with and without subslicing shows that the new approach substantially reduces artifacts in the image reconstruction. (Abstract shortened with permission of author. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackground, Motivation and ObjectiveAchieving a high {{frame rate}} in {{echocardiography}} is highly important for quantifying the short {{phases of the}} cardiac cycle that contain valuable information for medical diagnosis. Additionally, the 3 D quantitative assessment of the heart would significantly improve the current measurements used in daily clinical routine. Nevertheless, obtaining ultrafast imagesremains a challenge due to the trade-off between the image quality and a high frame rate, especially when volumetric data is acquired. Among the current ultrafast imaging methods, multi-line-transmit imaging (MLT) provides an increased frame rate {{but in the same}} time mostly preserves the image quality. However, the current implementation of this methodin 3 D proposed by Ortega et al. [IEEE TUFC 2016] is based on generating the MLT data synthetically by summing up the raw data before beamforming. In this paper we present the first real-time implementation of the MLT in 3 D ultrasound. Statement of Contribution/MethodsMulti-line-transmission was performed by dividing the angular aperture into three regions. Then, due to practical limitations, three equally spaced focused beams were transmitted simultaneously in the first YZ plane of the first region. Once the transmission for a full YZ plane was completed, the process was repeated for the first YZ plane of the second region. The same steps were followed till the full volume was insonified. Data acquisition was performed using four Verasonics systems synchronized to drive a 32 x 32 matrix probe. A transmit frequency of 2. 97 MHz was used and the images were acquired using a sampling frequency of 11. 9 MHz. The focal point was set to 6. 7 cm depth along 27 different angles in elevational direction (YZ) and 30 angles in azimuthal direction (XZ) between - 20 º and 20 º. Results/DiscussionThe contrast and the resolution assessment, performed on a CIRS ultrasound phantom (Figure 1) showed a contrast of 6. 36 dB and a mean axial (lateral) resolution of 0. 9 mm (1. 77 mm) measured for different depths. These values are comparable with those obtained for a 3 D focused sequence obtained by using the same emission parameters. The results indicate the potential of MLT 3 D for achieving high contrast and resolution while increasing the frame rate. This study thus demonstrates the feasibility of 3 D MLT in real-time and extends its possible applications to <b>dynamic</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>imaging...</b>|$|E

In this article, the authors investigate the degree to which perfusion defects can be detected from the dynamic information conveyed by 5 D images, a problem that is particularly challenging in the absence of multiple fast camera rotations. METHODS: The authors first demonstrate the usefulness of dynamic reconstructed images for perfusion detection by using linear discriminant analyses (Fisher linear discriminant analysis and principal component analysis) and a numerical channelized Hotelling observer. The authors then derive three types of discriminant metrics for characterizing the temporal kinetic information in reconstructed dynamic images for differentiating perfusion defects from normal cardiac perfusion, which are the Fisher linear discriminant map, temporal derivative map, and kinetic parametric images. RESULTS: Results are based on the NURBS-based cardiac-torso phantom with simulation of Tc 99 m-teboroxime as the imaging agent. The derived metric maps and quantitative contrast-to-noise ratio results demonstrate that the reconstructed dynamic images could yield higher detectability of the perfusion defect than conventional gated reconstruction while providing wall motion information simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed metrics can be used to produce new types of visualizations, showing wall motion and perfusion information, that may potentially be useful for clinical evaluation. Since 5 D imaging permits wall motion and kinetics to be observed simultaneously, it may ultimately obviate the need for separate stress and rest scans...|$|R

The reduction of the long acquisition times required for cardiovascular applications is crucial to achieve good spatiotemporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Nowadays there are many acceleration techniques which can reduce acquisition time, including compressed sensing technique. Compressed sensing allows image reconstruction from undersampled data, by means of a non linear reconstruction which minimizes the total variation of the image. The recently appeared Split Bregman methodology has proved to be more computationally efficient to solve this problem than classic optimization methods. In the case of dynamic {{magnetic resonance}} imaging, compressed sensing can exploit time sparsity by the minimization of total variation across both space and time. In this work, we propose and validate the Split Bregman method to minimize spatial and time total variation, and apply this method to accelerate cardiac cine acquisitions in rats. We found that applying a quasi-random variable density pattern along the phase-encoding direction, accelerations up to a factor 5 are possible with low error. In the future, we expect to obtain higher accelerations using spatiotemporal undersampling.
