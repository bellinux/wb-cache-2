Since government also controlled materials supplies - notably steel supplies - the Pons Plan could not be ignored. Talbot were not forbidden to build cars, but they, along with Hotchkiss and Delahaye-Delage were restricted to a class entitled by the bureaucrats [...] "véhicules de classe exceptionnelle" [...] - high-class vehicles.

40|$|Executive summary The {{regulatory}} control of nuclear materials (nuclear safeguards) {{is a prerequisite}} for the peaceful use of nuclear energy in Finland. In order to maintain the Finnish part of the international agreements on nuclear non-proliferation – mainly the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) – this {{regulatory control}} is implemented by the Nuclear Materials Section of the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK). The results of STUK's nuclear safeguards inspection activities in 2015 continued to demonstrate that the Finnish licence holders take good care of their nuclear materials. There were no indications of undeclared nuclear materials or activities and the inspected materials and activities were in accordance with the stakeholders' declarations. Safeguards are applied to nuclear materials and activities that can lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. These safeguards include nuclear materials accountancy, control, security and the reporting of nuclear fuel cycle-related activities. The main parties involved in a state nuclear safeguards system are the facilities that use nuclear materials, often referred to as “licence holders” or “operators”– and the state authority. A licence holder shall take good care of its nuclear materials and the state authority shall provide the regulatory control to ensure that the licence holder fulfils the requirements. The control of nuclear expert organisations, technology holders and suppliers, to ensure the non-proliferation of sensitive technology, is also a growing global challenge for all stakeholders. In Finnish legislation, all these stakeholders are dealt with as users of nuclear energy. At the end of 2013, the revised STUK requirements were published as regulatory guides on nuclear safety, security and safeguards, called YVL guides. According to the Guide YVL D. 1 Regulatory Control of Nuclear Safeguards all the stakeholders were requested to prepare their safeguards manuals as a part of their quality managements systems. During 2015, in total 19 draft manuals were submitted to STUK, and 14 of those were approved. Finland has quite significant nuclear power production, but the related nuclear industry is rather limited. Most of the declared nuclear materials (uranium, plutonium and thorium) in Finland reside at the nuclear power plants in Olkiluoto and Loviisa. Additionally, there is the research reactor in Espoo, as well as a dozen minor nuclear material holders in Finland. Nuclear dual-use items and instrumentation for the Olkiluoto 3 reactor under construction are being imported and installed. The import licences are reviewed as applicable to ensure the peaceful use of the technology. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the European Commission made their site visits to the construction site prior to the installation of safeguards instrumentation and fuel delivery. The planning and design of the Olkiluoto 4 reactor and a new nuclear power plant site, Hanhikivi in Pyhäjoki, were authorised in 2010. The safeguards systems for these new reactors shall be designed together with facility design and development. Similarly to the Olkiluoto 3 reactor that is under construction, the import licences for the new facilities are reviewed as applicable to ensure the peaceful use of the technology and sensitive information. The operators submitted the preliminary Basic Technical Characteristics to the European Commission and obtained Material Balance Area codes for the future reactors before the vendor companies were selected. During 2015, the construction licence application for the new Hanhikivi plant was submitted to the <b>Government.</b> The <b>authorisation</b> of the Olkiluoto 4 unit expired as the operator did not apply for the construction licence within the 5 year period of validity of the authorisation, i. e. the Decision-in-Principle by the Government, so the material balance area code was also withdrawn. The research reactor was shut down in 2015 and the preparations for decommissioning continue in Espoo. On the other hand, in order to continue research activities, the new VTT Centre for Nuclear Safety was under construction at the research campus in Espoo. Uranium production as one of the by-products of nickel at the Talvivaara mine was given approval by the Government in accordance with the nuclear energy legislation in March 2012. In 2013, the mining company constructed the uranium extraction plant, but the Supreme Administrative Court rescinded the approval, owing to claims of environmental and economic issues in December 2013 before the commissioning of the plant. The difficulties continued in 2014, and finally in November 2014 Talvivaara Sotkamo Ltd. filed for bankruptcy. During 2015 a new operator, Terrafame Mining Oy took over the mining and milling activities, but no uranium extraction nor safeguards activities took place at Talvivaara. Currently, uranium residuals are extracted from the nickel at Harjavalta Nickel Refinery and at Freeport Cobalt in Kokkola, and reported to STUK and to the European Commission. STUK maintains a national nuclear materials accountancy system and verifies that nuclear activities in Finland are carried out in accordance with the Finnish Nuclear Energy Act and Decree, European Union Safeguards Regulation and international agreements. These tasks are performed to verify that Finland can assure itself and the international community of the absence of undeclared nuclear activities and materials. In addition to this, the IAEA evaluates the success of the state safeguards system, and the European Commission participates in safeguarding the materials under its jurisdiction. The application for the construction licence for the disposal facility, which consists of the encapsulation plant and the geological repository, was submitted to the Government in December 2012. During 2013 and 2014, the IAEA and the Commission defined the requirements for the safeguards equipment for the encapsulation plant in an interactive process with STUK and Posiva. These needs were included in the STUK statement and safety evaluation concerning the construction licence application finalised in February 2015. In November 2015 the Government granted the construction licence. In the meanwhile, the detailed design of the facility was updated resulting in the continuation of the planning of the safeguards system. The number of the routine inspection days of the international inspectorates has been reduced significantly due to the state-level safeguards approach for Finland, which has been in force since 2008. The number of international inspection days per year is approximately 25. Neither the IAEA nor the Commission made any remarks nor did they present any required actions based on their inspections during 2015. By means of their nuclear materials accountancy and control systems, the stakeholders enabled STUK to fulfil its own obligations under the international agreements relevant to nuclear safeguards. In safeguards, STUK continues with 40 annual inspections and 60 inspection days. In 2014, the number of inspection days was significantly higher owing to the extensive survey campaign to verify the design of the planned geological repository, called Onkalo. In 2015 a concise survey campaign was carried out at Onkalo resulting in an increased number of inspection days since 2013. The number of annual inspection days for nuclear material holders has remained at 20 days per international inspectorate. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is one of the elements of the global nuclear non-proliferation effort. STUK has two roles in relation to the CTBT: STUK operates the Finnish National Data Centre (FiNDC) and one of the radionuclide laboratories (RL 07) in the CTBT International Monitoring Network (IMS). The main task of the FiNDC is to inspect data received from the International Monitoring System and to inform the national authority, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, about any indications of a nuclear weapons test. The FiNDC falls under the non-proliferation process in STUK’s organisation, together with the regulatory control of nuclear materials. A major goal of all current CTBT-related activities is the entry into force of the CTBT itself. An important prerequisite for such positive political action is that the verification system of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) is functioning and able to provide assurance to all parties {{that it is impossible to}} make a clandestine nuclear test without detection. The FiNDC is committed to its own role in the common endeavour, so that the verification system of the CTBTO can accomplish its detection task. The human resources development at the Nuclear Materials Section during 2015 was focused on nuclear material control: in particular, information security issues were addressed. This was partly due to the need to regulate the construction of the disposal facility for spent nuclear fuel at the Olkiluoto repository site. In addition, STUK contributed to educational workshops and training courses for authorities who represent nuclear newcomers: countries that aim at uranium production or nuclear power in cooperation with the IAEA. STUK and Finnish Customs continued the joint multi-year border monitoring development project. The project covers customs officers training as well as the updating of technical equipment and of operational procedures. In 2014, the partnerships programme between King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (K. A. CARE), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and STUK began supporting the establishment of the Saudi Arabia’s regulatory authority in relation to its nuclear energy programme. In the field of safeguards and nuclear security, STUK’s safeguards and security experts continued practical cooperation with their colleagues at K. A. CARE...|$|R

6000|$|... 'All {{the events}} of that night have a great importance, since they brought about a {{situation}} which remained unchanged till Jim's return. Jim had been away in the interior for more than a week, and it was Dain Waris who had directed the first repulse. That brave and intelligent youth ("who knew how to fight after the manner of white men") wished to settle the business off-hand, but his people were too much for him. He had not Jim's racial prestige and the reputation of invincible, supernatural power. He was not the visible, tangible incarnation of unfailing truth and of unfailing victory. Beloved, trusted, and admired as he was, he was still one of them, while Jim was one of us. Moreover, the white man, a tower of strength in himself, was invulnerable, while Dain Waris could be killed. Those unexpressed thoughts guided the opinions of the chief men of the town, who elected to assemble in Jim's fort for deliberation upon the emergency, as if expecting to find wisdom and courage in the dwelling of the absent white man. The shooting of Brown's ruffians was so far good, or lucky, that there had been half-a-dozen casualties amongst the defenders. The wounded were lying on the verandah tended by their women-folk. The women and children from {{the lower part of the}} town had been sent into the fort at the first alarm. There Jewel was in command, very efficient and high-spirited, obeyed by Jim's [...] "own people," [...] who, quitting in a body their little settlement under the stockade, had gone in to form the garrison. The refugees crowded round her; and through the whole affair, to the very disastrous last, she showed an extraordinary martial ardour. It was to her that Dain Waris had gone at once at the first intelligence of danger, for you must know that Jim was the only one in Patusan who possessed a store of gunpowder. Stein, with whom he had kept up intimate relations by letters, had obtained from the Dutch <b>Government</b> a special <b>authorisation</b> to export five hundred kegs of it to Patusan. The powder-magazine was a small hut of rough logs covered entirely with earth, and in Jim's absence the girl had the key. In the council, held at eleven o'clock in the evening in Jim's dining-room, she backed up Waris's advice for immediate and vigorous action. I am told that she stood up by the side of Jim's empty chair at the head of the long table and made a warlike impassioned speech, which for the moment extorted murmurs of approbation from the assembled headmen. Old Doramin, who had not showed himself outside his own gate for more than a year, had been brought across with great difficulty. He was, of course, the chief man there. The temper of the council was very unforgiving, and the old man's word would have been decisive; but it is my opinion that, well aware of his son's fiery courage, he dared not pronounce the word. More dilatory counsels prevailed. A certain Haji Saman pointed out at great length that [...] "these tyrannical and ferocious men had delivered themselves to a certain death in any case. They would stand fast on their hill and starve, or they would try to regain their boat and be shot from ambushes across the creek, or they would break and fly into the forest and perish singly there." [...] He argued that by the use of proper stratagems these evil-minded strangers could be destroyed without the risk of a battle, and his words had a great weight, especially with the Patusan men proper. What unsettled the minds of the townsfolk was the failure of the Rajah's boats to act at the decisive moment. It was the diplomatic Kassim who represented the Rajah at the council. He spoke very little, listened smilingly, very friendly and impenetrable. During the sitting messengers kept arriving every few minutes almost, with reports of the invaders' proceedings. Wild and exaggerated rumours were flying: there was a large ship at the mouth of the river with big guns and many more men--some white, others with black skins and of bloodthirsty appearance. They were coming with many more boats to exterminate every living thing. A sense of near, incomprehensible danger affected the common people. At one moment there was a panic in the courtyard amongst the women; shrieking; a rush; children crying--Haji Sunan went out to quiet them. Then a fort sentry fired at something moving on the river, and nearly killed a villager bringing in his women-folk in a canoe together with the best of his domestic utensils and a dozen fowls. This caused more confusion. Meantime the palaver inside Jim's house went on in the presence of the girl. Doramin sat fierce-faced, heavy, looking at the speakers in turn, and breathing slow like a bull. He didn't speak till the last, after Kassim had declared that the Rajah's boats would be called in because the men were required to defend his master's stockade. Dain Waris in his father's presence would offer no opinion, though the girl entreated him in Jim's name to speak out. She offered him Jim's own men in her anxiety to have these intruders driven out at once. He only shook his head, after a glance or two at Doramin. Finally, when the council broke up it had been decided that the houses nearest the creek should be strongly occupied to obtain the command of the enemy's boat. The boat itself was not to be interfered with openly, so that the robbers on the hill should be tempted to embark, when a well-directed fire would kill most of them, no doubt. To cut off the escape of those who might survive, and to prevent more of them coming up, Dain Waris was ordered by Doramin to take an armed party of Bugis down the river to a certain spot ten miles below Patusan, and there form a camp on the shore and blockade the stream with the canoes. I don't believe for a moment that Doramin feared the arrival of fresh forces. My opinion is that his conduct was guided solely by his wish to keep his son out of harm's way. To prevent a rush being made into the town the construction of a stockade was to be commenced at daylight at the end of the street on the left bank. The old nakhoda declared his intention to command there himself. A distribution of powder, bullets, and percussion-caps was made immediately under the girl's supervision. Several messengers were to be dispatched in different directions after Jim, whose exact whereabouts were unknown. These men started at dawn, but before that time Kassim had managed to open communications with the besieged Brown.|$|R
40|$|This {{article will}} explore how voices of dissent are {{articulated}} within a highly marginalised but vibrantly independent Hong Kong documentary film practice. In {{view of the}} city’s almost clichéd East-West hybrid identity, its fluctuating fortunes and its current political transition process, it is unsurprising that Hong Kong documentary makers have made a significant though largely under-estimated contribution to the city’s political, social and cultural discourse. Following recent research on Hong Kong documentary film history, {{it is clear that}} much of the Territory’s documentary history reveals two major stimuli to its documentary film-making: namely <b>government</b> <b>authorisation</b> and patronage and, on the other hand, patriotic concern for the mainland on the part of independent film-makers. As I will argue, the Tiananmen massacre or ‘incident’ that occurred over twenty years ago proved a watershed in Hong Kong’s documentary film-making. In effect it broke the mould, by introducing a strongly dissident and sceptical strain among documentarians vis-à-vis relations with the China Mainland. This dissident strain has generally been neglected in critical discourses on Hong Kong cinema, a neglect that the present article seeks to remed...|$|E
40|$|Although we kill around 3 million {{kangaroos}} annually, {{the current}} widespread commercial and non-commercial killing of kangaroos {{has yet to}} be proven necessary according to this report. Over the last decade in Australia, the Federal and State governments have approved an annual commercial kill of some four to six million kangaroos and wallabies each year. On average three million kangaroos are actually ‘harvested’/killed. 2 Around three hundred thousand young at foot and 800, 000 pouch young are either killed or left to die each year as collateral of the commercial industry. In addition, up to 200, 000 kangaroos and wallabies are killed for non-commercial reasons each year. A further unknown number are killed without <b>government</b> <b>authorisation.</b> This is the largest land-based slaughter of wildlife in the world. This report provides an analysis of the law and policy governing the killing of kangaroos. It provides an historical outline of kangaroo killing in Australia and examines the reasons for and against the kill. The report describes and analyses the legislative and regulatory framework governing the killing of kangaroos, in order to assist policymakers understand an area which is complex and often misunderstood. The conclusion of this report is that the current widespread commercial and non-commercial killing of kangaroos {{has yet to be}} proven necessary. Governments do not provide any clear justification for the killing such as through a proper consideration of the reasons for and against control. State governments once treated kangaroos as agricultural pests yet today they are treated as a resource. These practices result in poor welfare outcomes for many kangaroos and joeys and may pose a risk to Australia’s sustainability...|$|E
