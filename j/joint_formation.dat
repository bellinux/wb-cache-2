Yet, while {{there has been a}} substantial body of work investigating supply chain networks, little research has paid attention to how the network structure affects the power balance between manufacturers and suppliers. This study investigates, from a power perspective, the role that network connectedness plays in new equity based <b>joint</b> venture <b>formations.</b> As such, we further the understanding of supply chain networks by examining network structure as a mechanism from which firms derive power. We articulate several hypotheses rooted in both network and power theories by specifically examining, from a power perspective, factors such as eigenvector centrality, closeness centrality, and weak components centrality. Further, we differentiate between horizontal and vertical joint venture configurations and elucidate the moderating effect it has in engendering new manufacturing <b>joint</b> venture <b>formations.</b> Empirical results show that structural network based power is a significant explanatory mechanism in new <b>joint</b> venture <b>formation,</b> and specifically, that power is, and should be a primary consideration in supply chain partnership decisions...|$|R

50|$|The {{interaction}} between RAD54 and RAD51, {{another member of}} the RAD52 epistasis group, in humans is mediated by the N-terminal domain of the hRAD54 protein. This N-terminal end interacts with both the free and bound ends of the RAD51 protein. RAD54 moves {{along the length of the}} DNA, producing positive supercoils ahead of the replication protein movement and negative supercoils trailing the complex. The interaction with RAD51 enhances the ability of RAD54 to perform this supercoiling and strained opening activity. These proteins also work together to form DNA joints, with RAD54 specifically extending the joints and stabilizing the D-loops formed. An alternative function of RAD54 may be to remove RAD51 proteins after <b>joints</b> <b>formation</b> and recombination initiation has occurred.|$|R

500|$|DMC1 (DNA meiotic {{recombinase}} 1) is a meiosis specific homolog of RAD51 that mediates strand exchange during homologous recombinational repair.

40|$|Abstract: Drawing on {{the real}} options approach, we analyse which factors motivate firms to choose {{technological}} <b>joint</b> venture <b>formation</b> as their technology strategy. Scholars researching joint ventures through the real options lens have usually focused on the ending stage of the alliance rather than on its formation. Using a panel of 29 376 observations from 4050 manufacturing firms operating in Spain between 1998 and 2005, our {{results are consistent with}} real options approach predictions. We find that the greater the firm’s absorptive capacity and the higher the degree of technological risk, the more likely the firm is to form a technological joint venture. Results also suggest that the greater the risk of pre-emption by rivals and the higher the opportunity costs associated with technological <b>joint</b> venture <b>formation,</b> the less likely the firm is to choose such a technology strategy. A further step towards bridging the gap between finance theory and strategic analysis is thus taken...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Guanxi {{and international}} <b>joint</b> venture <b>formation</b> in China from an SME perspective. This {{study is a}} single-case study that focuses on Finetex EnE’s <b>joint</b> venture <b>formation</b> process into the Chinese market. Finetex EnE is a South Korean company that operates in the nanotechnology field. The company specializes in producing nano-scale fibers and structures through their patented electrospinning process. Finetex EnE is headquartered in Seoul, Korea. The company’s Canadian entity is currently {{in the process of}} forming a joint venture with a Chinese partner company in China. This study examines Guanxi from the foreign company’s perspective. The theoretical background of the study includes literature about SMEs and <b>joint</b> venture <b>formation</b> in China, as well as the role of Guanxi in China. The synthesis of international <b>joint</b> venture <b>formation</b> and Guanxi in China is presented in the end of the theory section. The methodology of this study is based on a qualitative case study, and the empirical data was collected through case company interviews and expert interviews. According to the main findings of this study, the role of Guanxi is very significant for SMEs that are forming an international joint venture in China. The SME must select an ideal partner company with connections to the Guanxi insiders. Foreigners can never access the core of the Guanxi inner circle, so it is vital for the partner company to have the optimal connections in China. It is also beneficial if the Chinese partner company has contacts to government officials, business-to-government Guanxi, since the legal system of China is weak. Once the SME has managed to cover all of the stages, the SME will have the pre-requisites to form an ideal joint venture in China. An important finding from the study is the changing nature of the Chinese business culture in entrepreneurship driven companies. Influences from the American business culture {{can be seen in the}} way that entrepreneurship driven companies do business in China. The empirical research reveals that the Chinese want to proceed very fast, which is very different from the Confucian type of old-style negotiation that used to exist in China. Further research could examine this phenomenon in more detail and also research the Chinese company’s viewpoint of Guanxi and business-to-government relations...|$|R

Moreover, <b>joint</b> venture <b>formation</b> usually involves over-monitoring, and ex post could involve cheating by one, or both the firms.

It provides a framework that allows one to analyze issues like both sided moral hazard, as well as monitoring in joint ventures. New insights are that monitoring issues can take several forms including over- and under-monitoring by partner firms, and, there is a linkage between such monitoring problems and joint venture instability.

40|$|The upper Burdigalian Vilobí Gypsum Unit, {{located in}} the Vallès Penedès half-grabben (NE Spain), {{consists}} of a 60 -m thick succession of laminated-to-banded secondary and primary gypsum affected by Neogene extension {{in the western part}} of Mediterranean Sea. This Tertiary extensional event is recorded in the evaporitic unit as six fracture sets (faults and joints), which can be linked with basin-scale deformation stages. All fractures are totally or partially infilled by four types of new gypsum precipitates showing a large variety of textures and microstructures. A structural and petrological study of the unit allows us to establish the following chronology of the fracture formation and infilling processes, from oldest to youngest: (i) S 1 and S 2 normal faults sets formation and precipitation of sigmoidal gypsum fibres; (ii) S 3 <b>joint</b> set <b>formation</b> and growing of perpendicular fibres; (iii) S 4 inverse fault development, infilled by oblique gypsum fibres and deformation of the previous fillings; and (iv) S 5 and S 6 <b>joint</b> <b>formations</b> and later dissolution processes, infilled by macrocrystalline gypsum cements. The fractures provided the pathway for fluid circulation in the Vilobí Unit. The oxygen, sulphur and strontium isotope compositions of the host rocks and the new precipitates in the fractures suggest clear convective recycling processes from the host-sulphates to the fracture infillings, recorded by a general enrichment trend to heavier S-O isotopes, from the oldest precipitates (sigmoidal fibres) to the youngest (macrocrystalline cements) and to the preservation of the strontium signals in the infillings. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.
