50|$|Thermal {{transfer}} printing is a {{very different}} method that uses a heat-sensitive ribbon instead of <b>heat-sensitive</b> <b>paper,</b> but uses similar thermal print heads.|$|R
5000|$|Thermal {{printers}} work by selectively heating {{regions of}} special <b>heat-sensitive</b> <b>paper.</b> Monochrome thermal printers {{are used in}} cash registers, ATMs, gasoline dispensers and some older inexpensive fax machines. Colours can be achieved with special papers and different temperatures and heating rates for different colours; these coloured sheets are not required in black-and-white output. One example is Zink (a portmanteau of [...] "zero ink").|$|R
50|$|Is a {{copying machine}} (in a drawer format) with a lamp as a heat source inside. An {{original}} sheet {{is exposed to}} the before said heat source in conjunction with future copy paper generating a copy on its specially treated surface. Is a kind of photocopy based {{on the effect of}} heat - When the black parts of the <b>heat-sensitive</b> <b>paper</b> generate some type of chemical reaction. The heat lamp makes indirect revealing. After cooling the film or paper, a stable black-and-white image is obtained.|$|R
50|$|The Silent 700 {{was a line}} of {{portable}} computer terminals manufactured by Texas Instruments in the 1970s and 1980s. Silent 700s printed with a dot-matrix heating element onto a roll of <b>heat-sensitive</b> <b>paper.</b> Some models were equipped with an integrated acoustic coupler and modem that could receive data at 30 characters per second. Other models could be directly connected to computers at 300 baud, and were sometimes used as the System console where a hard copy record of the activities would be retained {{for a period of}} time.|$|R
40|$|References to {{previous}} designs {{and other objects}} {{play an important role}} in the synthesis of new design ideas, but object references are used for a wide variety of other purposes in design thinking. This study reports on the roles that object references played in design meetings in projects developing two very different products: a crematorium, and a hand-held device with a thermal print head for drawing on <b>heat-sensitive</b> <b>paper.</b> These roles depended on the moment-to-moment needs of the participants in the meetings, which varied rapidly within meetings, and which were determined largely by the type of product and the state of the project. Almost all the references used were concise identifiers of concepts or features, or exemplars of categories. EPSR...|$|R
50|$|Many {{types of}} chart {{recorders}} use a galvanometer {{to drive the}} marking device. A light coil of wire suspended in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet deflects {{in proportion to the}} current through it; instead of the pointer and scale of a direct-reading meter, the recorder deflects a pen or other marking device. The writing mechanism may be a heated needle writing on <b>heat-sensitive</b> <b>paper</b> or a simple hollow ink-fed pen. If the pen is continuously pressed against the paper, the galvanometer must be strong enough to move the pen against the friction of the paper. To lessen the strain on the galvanometer the pen might instead only intermittently be pressed against the writing medium, to make an impression, and then move while pressure is released.|$|R
40|$|The present work {{describes}} three {{electronic devices}} {{designed for use}} in the Skylab airlock module: the teleprinter system, the quartz crystal microbalance contamination monitor (QCM), and the speaker. Design considerations, operation, characteristics, and system development are described for these systems, with accompanying diagrams, graphs, and photographs. The teleprinter is a thermal dot printer used to produce hard copy messages by electrically heating print elements in contact with <b>heat-sensitive</b> <b>paper.</b> The QCM was designed to estimate contamination buildup on optical surfaces of the earth resources experiment package. A vibrating quartz crystal is used as a microbalance relating deposited mass to shifts in the crystal's resonant frequency. Audio devices provide communication between crew members and between crew and STDN, and also provide audible alarms, via the caution and warning system, of out-of-limit-conditions...|$|R
5000|$|The Game Boy Camera and Game Boy Printer (Pocket Camera and Pocket Printer in Japan) are {{accessories}} for the Game Boy handheld gaming {{system and}} were released in 1998. The camera can take basic, often grainy, black-and-white digital images using the four-color palette of the Game Boy system. The printer utilizes <b>heat-sensitive</b> <b>paper</b> to [...] "burn" [...] saved images, making a hard copy. There are also several minigames {{built into the}} camera itself. A picture of the player's face is used as an avatar in the minigames. Both accessories were marketed by Nintendo as light-hearted entertainment devices in all three major video game regions of the world: Japan, North America, and Europe. The former N64 Magazine {{went so far as}} to dedicate a monthly section to the devices.|$|R
5000|$|Lippold discerned that an 8-12 Hz range {{physiological}} tremor {{was associated}} with the contraction of human muscles indicated a connection between psychological stress and its effect on the human body. On September 5, 1972, three retired U.S. Army officers—Allan D. Bell Jr., Wilson H. Ford, and Charles R. McQuiston—filed a U.S. patent under their corporation name, Dektor Counterintelligence and Security, Inc. for their “physiological response analysis method and apparatus.”. Bell's expertise was in counterintelligence, Ford's was in electronics, and McQuiston's was in polygraphy. Ford had invented an electronic device that utilized the theory of Lippold, Halliday, and Redfearn in which he tape-recorded the human voice, slowed it down to one-third or one-fourth its normal rate, and fed it through several low pass filters which then fed the signal into an EKG strip chart recorder. The strip chart recorder then made chart tracings on <b>heat-sensitive</b> <b>paper.</b> Their Psychological Stress Evaluator (PSE) was the first commercially available VSA. According to Allan Bell Enterprises, [...] "All lie-detection examinations or evaluations are predicated upon the fact that telling a significant lie will produce some degree of psychological stress. Psychological stress, in turn, causes a number of physiological changes.".|$|R
