5|$|In February and March 2009, Morrison {{returned}} to the US for Astral Weeks Live concerts, interviews and TV appearances with concerts at Madison Square Garden and at the Beacon Theatre in New York City. He was interviewed by <b>Don</b> <b>Imus</b> on his Imus in the Morning radio show and put in guest appearances on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and Live with Regis and Kelly. Morrison continued with the Astral Weeks performances with two concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in London in April and then {{returned to}} California in May 2009 performing the Astral Weeks songs at the Hearst Greek Theatre in Berkeley, the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles, California and appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Morrison filmed the concerts at the Orpheum Theatre so they could be viewed by Farrah Fawcett, confined to bed with cancer and thus unable to attend the concerts.|$|E

50|$|The show {{launched}} {{as a long}} anticipated {{successor to}} Imus in the Morning, the television simulcast of <b>Don</b> <b>Imus's</b> popular radio show.|$|R
50|$|He {{stayed there}} until May 2004, {{returning}} to WABC (AM) in 2006 as the sports reporter for Curtis and Kuby, and continuing, with a two-week hiatus, on the Imus in the Morning program following <b>Don</b> <b>Imus's</b> arrival at WABC (AM). He served as Imus's sports contributor until November 3, 2016, when Imus decided to replace Wolf with Sid Rosenberg.|$|R
50|$|After stints as a Hispanic and an {{alternative}} rock station (playing a repeating two-hour tape loop), the Hot Talk format debuted in 2001. KCTE's programming previouslu included <b>Don</b> <b>Imus's</b> morning show and local shows hosted by personalities from KMBC-TV. The station also carried {{a large portion}} of ESPN Radio programming until it moved to sister station KCXM in January 2007. The current lineup includes Dennis Miller, and some local programming.|$|R

25|$|Before Francesa and Russo were paired, Russo was an overnight/weekend and fill-in host. He {{caught the}} {{attention}} of <b>Don</b> <b>Imus,</b> who was impressed with his vibrant personality and brought Russo onto the Imus in the Morning show as its sports reporter.|$|E
50|$|Abboud married Lynn Weinstein on June 6, 1976. They {{have two}} daughters, Lila and Ari, and reside in Bedford, New York. He {{frequently}} appeared on <b>Don</b> <b>Imus's</b> radio show {{and was a}} regular caller to the New York City radio station, WFAN, to discuss his beloved Boston Red Sox, the New York Yankees' rival. In 2002, {{he was the first}} fashion designer to throw out the opening pitch at Boston's Fenway Park for a Red Sox game.|$|R
5000|$|For a time, WGLB-FM carried various satellite-delivered {{syndicated}} formats, but {{in later}} years were mostly live and local. The slogan was [...] "Retro Radio". They briefly carried <b>Don</b> <b>Imus's</b> syndicated morning talk radio show in the late 1990s. The stations languished {{at the bottom of}} the Milwaukee area ratings due to its location and limited signal, which did not penetrate the southern half of Milwaukee County, though it maintained a small and dedicated fanbase in the market for its formats and program choices unique for the market.|$|R
50|$|WWWM-FM {{was first}} {{licensed}} as KOUO on March 26, 1992 to Jack Moore (creator/owner {{of the former}} Twin Cities stations WAYL 93.7 FM and KTWN 107.9 FM), and signed on as KCFE (Cafe 105.7) on March 11, 1993, airing a light jazz/adult album alternative format (which resembled the original format of Cities 97 from the 1980s, which was modeled largely on Moore's KTWN c. late 1970s-early 1980s). The station carried <b>Don</b> <b>Imus's</b> syndicated morning show for a short time. In October 1996, KCFE was sold to Cargill and briefly become REV105's third transmitter, prior to all three stations being sold to ABC Radio the following March.|$|R
25|$|On April 12, 2007, Francesa {{announced}} in the afternoon that <b>Don</b> <b>Imus</b> had been dismissed by CBS Radio, {{the parent company of}} WFAN. This dismissal came {{on the heels of the}} permanent cancellation of Imus's telecast on MSNBC the previous day.|$|E
25|$|On the April 4, 2007 {{broadcast}} of Imus in the Morning, <b>Don</b> <b>Imus</b> made a sexually and racially controversial comment {{in reference to}} the Rutgers University women's basketball team. Imus made the remarks during a conversation with the show's producer, Bernard McGuirk, and Sid Rosenberg (who was on the phone).|$|E
25|$|John Joseph O'Connor, Cardinal Archbishop of the Archdiocese of New York, {{obtained}} a master's degree in Advanced Ethics at Villanova University. John L.

5000|$|This show, {{in its own}} comedic way, {{is helping}} people to educate {{the power of this}} word, and how it can feel to have hate {{language}} directed at you. Kovon and Jill Flowers [...] Parents Television Council founder L. Brent Bozell claimed that {{there was a lack of}} protest against this episode compared to radio host <b>Don</b> <b>Imus's</b> comments about the Rutgers University women's basketball team, even challenging Flowers' comments that the episode's use of nigger was not intended to be racist, but in fact the theme of the episode was to argue against those who support civility. The PTC named this episode, along with the episode of The Sarah Silverman Program that aired right after this episode, the [...] "Worst Cable Content of the Week" [...] in its campaign for cable choice.|$|R
50|$|In {{the wake}} of the shock jock <b>Don</b> <b>Imus's</b> {{controversial}} comments in early 2007, CBS Radio fired the long time radio personality. From that point on, the 6:00 to 10:00 a.m. time slot was filled by various hosts to help fill the void left by the Imus firing. Charles McCord and Chris Carlin remained on all the replacement shows as assistance and staff, in similar roles as they were on Imus's show, and the replacement shows continued to be syndicated via Westwood One. Mike Francesa and Chris Russo were the first to fill the spot, hosting for the two weeks (April 16-27) immediately after Imus' firing. Francesa and Russo also worked the shift separate from each other, as did fellow WFAN staffers Richard Neer, Joe Benigno and Evan Roberts, and Carlin, who worked both alone and with co-hosts, notably Kim Jones and Washington Post sports columnist John Feinstein.|$|R
50|$|On November 29, 2006, WJOX began {{simulcasting}} on the 100.5 FM {{frequency of}} sister station WRAX. On December 1, the AM station changed its call letters to WSPZ, and the WJOX call sign {{moved to the}} FM station. On January 8, 2007, WJOX-FM and WSPZ began separate sports programming schedules. Three of the local call-in shows from the former WJOX moved to FM, and a new morning-drive show was created, reuniting former WJOX morning drive personalities Matt Coulter and Scott Griffin. As {{a result of the}} change, and to differentiate itself from WJOX, an affiliate of ESPN Radio, WSPZ affiliated with Fox Sports Radio. Coulter was let go by WSPZ on January 22, 2008 when his contract was not renewed. Scott Griffin was fired on July 17, 2008 and his show was replaced with syndicated sports talk, then <b>Don</b> <b>Imus's</b> nationally syndicated morning show.|$|R
25|$|<b>Don</b> <b>Imus</b> {{was also}} a part owner of Autobody Express stores with his late brother, Fred (who was a {{frequent}} caller to the radio show, commenting on NASCAR races, the NFL and related pop culture matters). The Autobody Express stores were located in Santa Fe, and inside the Mohegan Sun Native American Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut. In 2003, the company failed and both stores closed.|$|E
25|$|On August 14, 2007, CBS {{announced}} {{a settlement with}} Imus on his $40million contract. On the same day, Rutgers basketball player Kia Vaughn, {{one of the women}} involved in the controversy, filed suit against <b>Don</b> <b>Imus,</b> NBC Universal, CBS Corporation, MSNBC, CBS Radio, Viacom, Westwood One radio, and Bernard McGuirk, citing slander, libel, and defamation of character. Vaughn was the only player to pursue legal damages brought on by the controversy. Vaughn dropped the lawsuit against Imus on September 11, 2007, citing her desire to concentrate on her studies and basketball training.|$|E
25|$|WEAF's call {{letters were}} changed to WNBC in 1946, then to WRCA in 1954, {{and back to}} WNBC in 1960. During the 1960s, WNBC relied less on network {{programming}} and adopted a talk format, followed by a switch to a middle-of-the-road music sound. The station {{spent much of the}} 1970s and early 1980s flipping between the Top 40 and adult contemporary formats, with varying success. By the middle of the 1980s up until its closing, WNBC played less music and relied more on personality-driven talk programs with hosts such as Howard Stern, <b>Don</b> <b>Imus,</b> Joey Reynolds, Alan Colmes, and Soupy Sales.|$|E
5000|$|Mushnick {{frequently}} criticized WFAN's popular Imus in the Morning {{program for}} its off-color humor and shock jock mentality, citing its cast calling Mother Teresa [...] "a no-good bitch" [...] and sportscaster and former WFAN host Len Berman as [...] "Lenny the Jew" [...] among other examples. He accused staff members Bernard McGuirk and Sid Rosenberg in particular of persistently {{crossing the line}} between crude humor and total inappropriateness. He insisted that if Rosenberg—often fired from WFAN for inappropriate remarks, continued absenteeism and bad public behavior—continued on the program, it would ultimately lead to the show's downfall. Prophetically, it was McGuirk and Rosenberg who were the main instigators of <b>Don</b> <b>Imus's</b> remarks about the Rutgers University women's basketball team that eventually resulted in WFAN's parent, CBS Corp, canceling Imus in the Morning. in retrospect, Mushnick wondered rhetorically why people were surprised by Imus' [...] "nappy-headed-ho" [...] comment.|$|R
40|$|Race, as Downing and Husband (2005) remind us, is a ‘social category’ {{without a}} ‘scientific basis’ (p. 2). And yet, {{for better or}} worse, race is a {{fundamental}} dimension of contemporary life, {{one of the few}} master tropes that define identities, elicit solidarities and operate as an instrument of othering. Though ‘more inclusive and less objectifying’ (Spencer, p. 45), ethnicity is a ‘transient concept’ (p. 47) that, perhaps more so than ‘race’, reflects public and scholarly understandings of difference. They can also be burning issues in the life of nations and regions. As I am writing these words, public discourse in the United States has for several weeks been agitated by radio talk-show <b>Don</b> <b>Imus’s</b> racist comments about the Rutgers University women’s basketball team, the French intelligentsia is enjoying a collective sigh of relief at the weaker-than expected performance in the 2007 presidential election of the far-right and xenophobic French politician Jean-Marie Le Pen, and sectarian polarization between Sunnis and Shi’as is gripping the Arab world, fuelled by the botched US–British occupation of Iraq, rhetorical war between the US and Iran and the consequences of the Israel–Hizbullah war in Lebanon in the summer of 2006...|$|R
2500|$|On November 1, Citadel {{announced}} {{they had agreed}} to what was reportedly a multi-year syndication contract with Imus. The new Imus in the Morning program would be distributed nationally by Citadel Media, and would be based at Citadel-owned WABC in New York City, beginning in December. On November 14, the New York Times reported that Imus had agreed to terms with cable network RFD-TV to air a video simulcast of the new radio program. Charles McCord and Bernard McGuirk have joined Imus in the {{new version of the}} show. On December 3, Imus returned to the airwaves on ABC Radio and RFD-TV. When asked about Imus's return to radio, Al Sharpton said in an interview, [...] "We'll monitor him; I'm not saying I'm going to throw a banquet for him and say welcome home. He has the right to make a living, but because he has such a consistent pattern with this we are going to monitor him to make sure he doesn't do it again." [...] On April 4, 2008, Jesse Jackson appeared on [...] "Imus in the Morning" [...] to discuss the 40th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King—a booking that would have seemed impossible nearly a year before, when Jackson joined 50 demonstrators in Chicago demanding that [...] "Imus Must Go." [...] Many media commentators declared <b>Don</b> <b>Imus's</b> rehabilitation complete.|$|R
25|$|Governor Jon Corzine {{was nearly}} {{killed in a}} car wreck on the Garden State Parkway in Galloway Township in 2007, as he was {{traveling}} to a meeting between a Rutgers sports team and radio personality <b>Don</b> <b>Imus.</b> Imus had infamously called the Rutgers University women's basketball team nappy-headed hos, leading to his firing by two communications networks. Imus met with the team at Drumthwacket to apologize, and Governor Corzine attempted to arrive at that meeting from Atlantic City, reaching speeds of at least 91mph (146km/h), without wearing a seatbelt. His chauffeur, a New Jersey State Police officer, lost control of the vehicle, seriously injuring the Governor and leading to a new period of acting governorship by Richard Codey while Corzine recuperated.|$|E
25|$|Francesa and Russo {{opened their}} show on April 10, 2007, by {{weighing}} {{in on the}} controversy involving <b>Don</b> <b>Imus</b> and the disparaging comments he made the previous Wednesday about the Rutgers University women's basketball team. The program began with an airing of statements delivered by team coach C. Vivian Stringer and team captain Essence Carson {{at a news conference}} held two hours prior. Mike followed with a monologue, in which he flatly denied rumors of a gag order in effect at WFAN, and confirmed that the decision to air portions of the Rutgers news conference {{at the top of the}} show had been made in consultation with program director Mark Chernoff. Francesa went on to clarify that while he had spoken with Imus a few days after the incident in question, his discussions with Imus had no bearing on how he reported the matter on Mike and the Mad Dog.|$|E
25|$|WOR {{switched}} to the tighter Drake format where DJ's weren't allowed to pick the music and talk as much, so Murray the K left New York radio to host programs in Toronto—on CHUM—and on WHFS 102.3 FM in Bethesda, Maryland in 1972. He returned to New York after his short stint on WHFS on the weekend show NBC Monitor and as a fill-in morning dj, and then in 1972 moved to a regular evening weekend program on WNBC radio where <b>Don</b> <b>Imus</b> was broadcasting; he was joined there by the legendary Wolfman Jack, a year later. Although it was low-key, Murray's WNBC show featured his own innovative trademark programming style, including telling stories that were illustrated by selected songs, his unique segues, and his pairing cuts by theme or idiosyncratic associations. In early 1975, he was brought on for a brief stint at Long Island alternative rock station WLIR, and his final New York radio show ran later that year on WKTU after which—already in ill health—he moved to Los Angeles. The syndicated show Soundtrack of the '60s mentioned below was heard in New York City on WCBS-FM. Gary Owens succeeded Murray as its host.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, <b>Don</b> and Deirdre <b>Imus</b> {{founded the}} Imus Ranch, a working cattle ranch near Ribera, New Mexico, 50 miles {{southeast}} of Santa Fe. The Imus Ranch is a charitable organization for children with cancer, as well as siblings of SIDS victims. They maintain three residences, one in Manhattan, another in Westport, Connecticut, and one in Ribera, New Mexico.|$|R
25|$|Imus also {{attracted}} public attention due to two lawsuits. On November 29, 2004, a former nanny, Nichole Mallette, sued Imus for wrongful termination and defamation after a Thanksgiving 2003 {{incident in which}} she was allegedly fired and escorted off his property at 4:15AM. <b>Don</b> and Deirdre <b>Imus</b> were allegedly upset over Mallette's possession of a cap-gun and pocket knife on ranch property.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Don</b> and Deirdre <b>Imus</b> {{met with}} the Rutgers team {{on the evening of}} April 12 at the New Jersey Governor's Mansion, {{according}} to a report broadcast by CNN, which characterized the meeting as [...] "emotional". C. Vivian Stringer, coach of the Rutgers team, said the next day that she and her team [...] "still find his statements to be unacceptable," [...] but that they accepted Imus's apology.|$|R
25|$|As <b>Don</b> <b>Imus</b> {{had already}} been the morning show host at WNBC, WFAN left the show in place when they took over the frequency. WFAN's {{original}} morning show on 1050 was hosted by Greg Gumbel. The show was a straightforward sports show, but was not doing well in the ratings. At {{the time of the}} switch, sports talk radio was still an untested format with questionable prospects, and the idea of bringing on board a host that appealed to a broader audience would get more people to try the station out. WFAN also benefitted from the inertia from Imus's fans who were used to tuning into 660kHz on weekday mornings to listen. WFAN instantly took advantage of its Imus inheritance; for example, it featured a special live monologue by Imus character Billy Sol Hargus from Shea Stadium moments after taking over the 660 frequency. Imus slightly altered his show for his new employer, adding sports updates and replays of last night's big plays. Discussions of sports stories that crossed over to general interest were also featured on the program, although Imus also kept many of his regular comedy bits that were not sports-related.|$|E
500|$|Morrison was {{scheduled}} to perform at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 25th anniversary concert on 30 October 2009, but cancelled. In an interview on 26 October, Morrison told his host, <b>Don</b> <b>Imus,</b> {{he had planned to}} play [...] "a couple of songs" [...] with Eric Clapton (who had cancelled on 22 October due to gallstone surgery), and they would do something else together at [...] "some other stage of the game".|$|E
500|$|Biden first {{mentioned}} his intentions {{to run for}} president for 2008 on the <b>Don</b> <b>Imus</b> radio show on December 8, 2004. In the edition of January 23, 2006 of The News Journal, Delaware's largest daily newspaper, columnist Harry F. Themal reported that Biden [...] "occupies the sensible center of the Democratic Party." [...] Themal concludes that this is the position Biden desires, and that in a campaign [...] "he plans to stress the dangers to the security of the average American, not just from the terrorist threat, but from the lack of health assistance, crime, and energy dependence on unstable parts of the world." ...|$|E
5000|$|Morning Joe {{began as}} a fill-in program after <b>Don</b> Imus' <b>Imus</b> in the Morning was canceled. Former Florida Congressman Joe Scarborough, then host of the primetime MSNBC program Scarborough Country, {{suggested}} {{the idea of doing}} a morning show instead. He put together what would become Morning Joe with Scarborough Country executive producer Chris Licht and screenwriter John Ridley. On April 9, 2007, the show debuted as {{one of a series of}} rotating programs auditioning for Imus's former slot, with Scarborough joined by co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Ridley. Scarborough had personally asked Brzezinski to co-host with him the night before the first audition, while she was a [...] "cut-in" [...] presenter during MSNBC's primetime schedule on a freelance basis.|$|R

She was a frequent guest on Fox Business Happy Hour and has appeared as a guest on the Fox News Channel late-night satire program Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld. She also appears on Hannity every Wednesday.|$|R
500|$|Despite the {{consensus}} from experts {{that there is}} no link between thiomersal and autism, many parents continue to hold belive that such a link exists. These parents share the viewpoint that autism is not just treatable, but curable through [...] "biomedical" [...] interventions and have been frustrated by the lack of progress from more [...] "mainline" [...] scientists in finding this cure. Instead, they have supported an alternative community of like-minded parents, physicians and scientists who promote this belief. This mindset has taught these parents to challenge the expertise from the mainstream scientific community. Parents have also been influenced by a large number of online anti-vaccination websites that present themselves as an alternative source for evidence using pseudoscientific claims. These websites use emotional appeals to gather support and frame the controversy as an adversarial dispute between parents and a conspiracy of doctors and scientists. Advocates for a thiomersal-autism link have also relied on celebrities like model Jenny McCarthy and information presented on <b>Don</b> Imus' <b>Imus</b> in the Morning radio show to persuade the public to their cause, instead of relying only on [...] "dry" [...] scientific papers and scientists. McCarthy has published a book describing her personal experience with her autistic son and appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to promote the hypothesis of vaccines causing autism. Bitterness over this issue has led to numerous threats made against the CDC as well as researchers like Offit, with increased security placed by the CDC in response to these threats.|$|R
