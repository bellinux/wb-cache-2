5|$|Dr.Dre {{has stated}} {{that he is a}} perfectionist and is known to {{pressure}} the artists with whom he records to give flawless performances. In 2006, Snoop Dogg told the website Dubcnn.com that Dr.Dre had made new artist Bishop Lamont re-record a single bar of vocals 107times. Dr.Dre has also stated that Eminem is a fellow perfectionist, and attributes his success on Aftermath to his similar work ethic. <b>He</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> lot of input into the delivery of the vocals and will stop an MC during a take if it is not to his liking. However, he gives MCs that he works with room to write lyrics without too much instruction unless it is a specifically conceptual record, as noted by Bishop Lamont in the book How to Rap.|$|E
5|$|Israel is a 58-year-old New Yorker {{who decided}} he couldn't be gay and Orthodox, {{and turned his}} back on his religion, though not before his family forced him into {{electroshock}} therapy to try to cure him. Now a tour guide in the Haredi neighborhoods of New York, the film follows him as <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> tour, psychoanalyzes himself and decides, on the 25th anniversary of being with his life partner, to call his 98-year-old father, a rabbi, whom he has not seen in over twenty years.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Professor Bernard Quatermass (Andrew Keir) is dismayed {{to learn}} that {{his plans for the}} {{colonisation}} of the Moon are to be taken over by the military. <b>He</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> cold reception to Colonel Breen (Julian Glover), who has been assigned to join Quatermass's British Experimental Rocket Group. When the bomb disposal team call for Breen's assistance, Quatermass accompanies him to the site. Breen concludes it is a V-weapon, but Quatermass disagrees. When another skeleton is found in an inner chamber, Quatermass and Roney realise that the object must also be five million years old. Quatermass suspects it is of alien origin, but Roney is certain the apemen are terrestrial.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon becomes {{friends with}} a new student, a Mexican {{immigrant}} named Pedro Sánchez (Efren Ramirez) who rarely conveys emotion or speaks. Pedro runs for class president after seeing a poster at the school dance. On the election day, <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> mediocre speech {{in front of the}} student body. Napoleon does a dance routine as Pedro's skit for the election and receives a standing ovation, saving the campaign and winning Pedro the election. Following the campaign, Kip and Lafawnduh meet each other in real life and are wed. Jared Hess has stated that the series takes place before the marriage, but after Pedro's election, and several new characters are introduced.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, an {{accounting}} teacher arrives, believing demonstrations {{are being held}} to determine which class will be cut, much to the anger of Ron. <b>He</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> very boring accounting lecture, which puts Justin to sleep. The next day, Leslie is before the Pawnee Disciplinary Committee on charges of abuse of power. Leslie calls Justin as a witness and questions him {{as to whether he}} enjoyed the party, to which he answers an emphatic yes. Afterward, the committee rules no further action will be taken, mainly because Leslie turned herself in and paid $1,000 restitution to the recreation center so no classes would be cut. When Ann asks why she did it, Leslie said it was to get an honest answer from Justin about the date, under penalty of perjury. The episode ends with Justin encouraging Tom to ask Wendy out.|$|E
5|$|The FBI {{intends to}} plant a fake {{advertisement}} to replace Lecktor's, but they realize that without the proper book code the Tooth Fairy will know it is fake; therefore, they let the advertisement run as it is, and Graham organizes an interview with Lounds, during which <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> false and derogatory profile of the Tooth Fairy to incite him. After a sting operation fails to catch the killer, Lounds is kidnapped by the Tooth Fairy (Tom Noonan). Waking in the killer's home, he is shown a slideshow of William Blake's The Great Red Dragon paintings, along with the Tooth Fairy's past victims and slides of a family the killer identifies as his next targets. Lounds is forced to tape-record a statement before being set on fire in a wheelchair and killed, his flaming body rolled into the parking garage of the National Tattler as a warning.|$|E

5|$|The {{legend of}} Orion was first told in full in a lost work by Hesiod, {{probably}} the Astronomia; simple references to Hesiod will refer to this, unless otherwise stated. This version is known {{through the work}} of a Hellenistic author on the constellations; <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> fairly long summary of Hesiod's discourse on Orion. According to this version, Orion was likely the son of the sea-god Poseidon and Euryale, daughter of Minos, King of Crete. Orion could walk on the waves because of his father; he walked to the island of Chios where he got drunk and attacked Merope, daughter of Oenopion, the ruler there. In vengeance, Oenopion blinded Orion and drove him away. Orion stumbled to Lemnos where Hephaestus — the lame smith-god — had his forge. Hephaestus told his servant, Cedalion, to guide Orion to the uttermost East where Helios, the Sun, healed him; Orion carried Cedalion around on his shoulders. Orion returned to Chios to punish Oenopion, but the king hid away underground and escaped Orion's wrath. Orion's next journey took him to Crete where he hunted with the goddess Artemis and her mother Leto, {{and in the course of}} the hunt, threatened to kill every beast on Earth. Mother Earth objected and sent a giant scorpion to kill Orion. The creature succeeded, and after his death, the goddesses asked Zeus to place Orion among the constellations. Zeus consented and, as a memorial to the hero's death, added the Scorpion to the heavens as well.|$|E

For instance, in {{a summary of}} the various traditions of the pilgrimage, <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> long outline of all the rituals which should be {{performed}} by the faithful, with very few traditions interrupting his description.

25|$|In the text, Milton conjectures {{about the}} {{formation}} of commonwealths. He {{comes up with a}} kind of constitutionalism but not an outright anti-monarchical argument. <b>He</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> theory of how people come into commonwealths and come to elect kings. He explains what the role of a king should be, and conversely what a tyrant is, and why it is necessary to limit a ruler's power through laws and oaths.|$|E
25|$|Alan Kurdi's father, Abdullah Kurdi, {{has stated}} {{in some of}} his {{interviews}} that the inflatable boat became uncontrollable as its engine had failed, with the 'captain' abandoning it and everyone else. Some Turkish sources claimed that in his first interview with the Doğan News Agency, <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> different account of the event; he also states that following two unsuccessful attempts to cross into the Greek island Kos, his family provided its own boat with its own means. However, Abdullah never confirmed the Doğan News Agency interview.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in the {{eleventh}} canto, Indra arrives as a sage, praises Arjuna's asceticism, but criticises him for seeking victory and wealth instead of liberation — {{the goddess of}} Fortune is fickle and indscriminate. Arjuna stands his ground, explaining his situation and pointing out that conciliation with evil people would lead one into doing wrong actions oneself. <b>He</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> further long speech that forms {{the heart of the}} epic, on right conduct, self-respect, resoluteness, dignity, and wisdom. Pleased, Indra reveals himself to his son, and asks him to worship Shiva.|$|E

25|$|In March 1821, Berlioz left {{high school}} in Grenoble, and in late September, at age 18, {{he was sent to}} Paris to study medicine, a field for which he had no {{interest}} and, later, outright disgust after viewing a human corpse being dissected. (<b>He</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> colorful account in his Mémoires.)

25|$|Magneto {{appears in}} X-Men Legends voiced by Tony Jay. Like the other {{characters}} in the game, he appears in his Ultimate costume, though his personality and his relationship with Xavier is more similar to his 616 incarnation. Mystique frees him from the U.S.S. Arbiter and he escapes to Asteroid M where <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> televised transmission for any mutant who wants {{to get away from}} the Genetic Research and Security Organization (GRSO) to head to the Mount. When confronted by the X-Men, he fights them alongside Mystique and Sabretooth. After the defeat, Magneto and his Brotherhood get away.|$|E
25|$|Before Moses dies <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> {{speech to}} the Israelites where he paraphrases {{a summary of the}} mizwoth given to them by Yahweh, and recites a prophetic song called the Ha'azinu. Moses prophesies that if the Israelites disobey the Torah, Yahweh will cause a global exile in {{addition}} to the minor one prophesied earlier at Mount Sinai, {{but at the end of}} days Yahweh will gather them back to Israel from among the nations when they turn back to the Torah with zeal. The events of the Israelite exodus and their sojourn in the Sinai are memorialized in the Jewish and Samaritan festivals of Passover and Sukkoth, and the giving of the Torah in the Jewish celebration of Shavuoth.|$|E

James' autobiographical Beyond a Boundary, the Trinidadian writer {{writes about}} his visits {{as a young}} man to his friend Learie Constantine, at that time living in Nelson while playing as a {{professional}} for the town Lancashire League team. <b>He</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> vivid sense of what it must have been like for a young West Indian to arrive in the wet and strange East Lancashire. He also describes how his subsequent education at university in Paris is helped by a local baker, and how his gradual politicisation is given a boost by meetings with local socialists, concerned with the harsh treatment and conditions suffered by the local working class millworkers. Although an extreme example, the meetings between other professional cricketers from the British Empire, and the mainly working-class amateurs of the Lancashire League, must have resulted in many other instances of mutual support and understanding.|$|E

500|$|He is {{critical}} of perfumes: [...] "Perfumes are the most pointless of luxuries, for pearls and jewels are at least passed on to one's heirs, and clothes last for a time, but perfumes lose their fragrance and perish {{as soon as they}} are used." [...] <b>He</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> summary of their ingredients, such as attar of roses, which he says is the most widely used base.
