5|$|Some species make a <b>hissing</b> <b>noise</b> {{while other}} {{cockroaches}} make a chirping noise. The Madagascar hissing cockroach produces its sound through the modified spiracles {{on the fourth}} abdominal segment. Several different hisses are produced, including disturbance sounds, produced by adults and larger nymphs, and aggressive, courtship and copulatory sounds produced by adult males.|$|E
5|$|Some species use {{vibrations}} {{for communicating}} within {{members of the}} same species, such as to attract mates as in the songs of the shield bug Nezara viridula. Vibrations {{can also be used to}} communicate between entirely different species; lycaenid (gossamer-winged butterfly) caterpillars, which are myrmecophilous (living in a mutualistic association with ants) communicate with ants in this way. The Madagascar hissing cockroach has the ability to press air through its spiracles to make a <b>hissing</b> <b>noise</b> as a sign of aggression; the death's-head hawkmoth makes a squeaking noise by forcing air out of their pharynx when agitated, which may also reduce aggressive worker honey bee behavior when the two are in close proximity.|$|E
25|$|For seven days, {{when not}} being interrogated, they were kept hooded and handcuffed {{in a cold}} cell and {{subjected}} to a continuous loud <b>hissing</b> <b>noise.</b> Here {{they were forced to}} stand in a stress position for many hours and were repeatedly beaten on all parts of their body. They were deprived of sleep, food and drink. Some of them also reported being kicked in the genitals, having their heads banged against walls, being shot at with blank rounds, and being threatened with injections. The result was severe physical and mental exhaustion, severe anxiety, depression, hallucinations, disorientation and repeated loss of consciousness.|$|E
50|$|Goannas also rear up when threatened, either chased or cornered, {{and also}} inflate flaps of skin around their throats and emit harsh <b>hissing</b> <b>noises.</b>|$|R
50|$|Not a vocal species; {{the male}} at times utters a shrill trill, while the female makes a {{guttural}} ook sound {{as well as}} <b>hissing</b> <b>noises</b> during breeding displays.|$|R
2500|$|Ferrets {{are similar}} to their real-life {{counterparts}} in appearance, but are notedly larger, more intelligent, and have hollow fangs with which to partially exsanguinate their victims. They are nocturnal, and seem to act merely as hunters of escapees rather than also fighting for the Overlords. They are mentioned to have great strength. Ferrets also have an affinity for underground locales, are afraid of heights, and hate water. They operate in [...] "fangs" [...] of five, and make <b>hissing</b> <b>noises</b> to communicate.|$|R
25|$|The {{explosion}} {{punched a}} 50-cm (20-inch) {{hole on the}} left side of the fuselage. Investigators from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) concluded that no emergency procedures had been started in the cockpit. The cockpit voice recorder, located in the tail section of the aircraft, was found in a field by police searchers within 24 hours. There was no evidence of a distress signal; a 180-millisecond <b>hissing</b> <b>noise</b> could be heard as the explosion destroyed the aircraft's communications centre. Although the explosion was in the aircraft hold, the effect was magnified by the large difference in pressure between the aircraft's interior and exterior, i.e., uncontrolled decompression of the fuselage. The steering cables disrupted and the fuselage pitched downwards and to the left.|$|E
500|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} is a {{relatively}} silent species. It {{has been known to}} give a quiet, one to two second long, hissing [...] "wheet" [...] call several times at intervals of about four seconds. To give this call, the rockfowl opens its beak and inflates its throat. When bringing food to their nests, the adults give one or two [...] "peep"s. After reaching the nest, the adult repeatedly makes a low [...] "ga-a-a" [...] sound that has been described as being between a snore and a sigh. It also makes a <b>hissing</b> <b>noise</b> that {{has been described as a}} [...] "shisss".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{users have}} {{reported}} a strange <b>hissing</b> <b>noise</b> during heavy {{usage of the}} phone. CNET reports it as [...] "faint buzzes and hums coming from the backside". The Daily Telegraph speculates that the iPhone 7's new A10 Fusion processor {{is the source of}} the noise, linking to tweets that compare the phone's hissing sound to [...] "hearing the fans spin up loudly whenever your Macâ€™s CPU gets used to its actual potential." [...] The issue has been referred to as Hissgate.|$|E
5000|$|Upon closer inspection, {{the animal}} {{turned out to}} be a rabbit. Not one of your cutesy, Easter Bunny-type rabbits, but one of those big splay-footed things that we called swamp rabbits when I was growing up.The animal was clearly in distress, or perhaps berserk. The President confessed to having had limited {{experience}} with enraged rabbits. He was unable to reach a definite conclusion about its state of mind. What was obvious, however, was that this large, wet animal, making strange <b>hissing</b> <b>noises</b> and gnashing its teeth, was intent upon climbing into the Presidential boat.|$|R
50|$|All audio {{operations}} are performed using frame manipulation so, as such, mp3DirectCut {{is not a}} waveform editor. Audio clean-up such as click, <b>hiss</b> and <b>noise</b> removal is not possible.|$|R
50|$|The common {{spotted cuscus}} is {{typically}} a solitary creature, feeding and nesting alone. Interactions with others, especially between competing males, can be aggressive and confrontational. Male cuscuses scent mark their territory to warn off other males, emitting a penetrating musk odor both from their bodies and scent gland excretions. They distribute saliva on branches and twigs of trees to inform others of their territory and mediate social interactions. If they encounter another male in their area, they make barking, snarling, and <b>hissing</b> <b>noises,</b> and stand upright to defend their territories. They are aggressive, and can scratch, bite, and kick potential predators.|$|R
2500|$|The iPhone 7 {{has been}} the subject of several {{reported}} issues, most notably a <b>hissing</b> <b>noise</b> during heavy usage of the phones and significant differences in performance between device variants. Apple has not released sales numbers for iPhone 7, but multiple U.S. carriers reported that it was in high demand on launch. Subsequent reports at the end of 2016 stated that Apple had reduced production of the models due to [...] "sluggish" [...] sales and decreasing demand, though sales research after the first quarter of 2017 placed the devices as the best-selling smartphones in the world.|$|E
2500|$|Lemon's dog ran ahead out {{of sight}} and {{suddenly}} began barking, and moments later ran back to the group with its tail between its legs. After traveling about [...] the group reached the top of a hill, where they reportedly saw a large pulsating [...] "ball of fire" [...] about [...] to their right. They also detected a pungent mist that made their eyes and noses burn. Lemon then noticed two small lights over {{to the left of the}} object, underneath a nearby oak tree and directed his flashlight towards them, revealing the creature, which May reported as bounding towards them. Other sources describe it as emitting a shrill <b>hissing</b> <b>noise</b> before gliding towards them, changing direction and then heading off towards the red light. At this point the group fled in panic.|$|E
6000|$|But the {{antiquarian}} superstition in Fanshaw {{was still}} quivering, {{and he said}} hastily: [...] "But, Admiral, what's that <b>hissing</b> <b>noise</b> quite near the island? It's very like fire." ...|$|E
500|$|Common {{names such}} as [...] "demon owl", [...] "death owl", or [...] "ghost owl" [...] show that traditionally, rural populations in many places {{considered}} barn owls to be birds of evil omen. For example, the Tzeltal people in Mexico regard them as [...] "disease givers". These owls don't [...] "hoot" [...] but emit raspy screeches and <b>hissing</b> <b>noises</b> or that their white face and underbelly feathers that are visible as they fly overhead make them look [...] "ghostly". Consequently, they were often persecuted by farmers who were unaware of the benefits these birds bring. Negative emotions can also {{be attributed to the}} false belief that they could eat large animals such as chickens and cats.|$|R
50|$|The Great Basin gopher snake {{is a great}} climber, swimmer, and burrower. It is one of {{the most}} {{commonly}} found snakes when people are hiking or driving on the road. They are easily seen in spring when the male snakes are out and about trying to find a mate. The hatchlings are easily found in late August and September when they emerge from their eggs. Like most animals, Great Basin gopher snakes are not dangerous unless provoked. When defending themselves from predators, they will elevate and inflate the body, and flatten the head into a triangular shape. Loud <b>hissing</b> <b>noises</b> will ensue, along with quick shaking of the tail, mimicking the sound of a deadly rattlesnake. Unlike a rattlesnake, however, the Great Basin gopher snake is nonvenomous.|$|R
5000|$|Excessive [...] "Hissing". Some users {{claimed that}} there was {{significant}} audible <b>hissing</b> when the <b>noise</b> cancellation capability was turned on.|$|R
60|$|The <b>hissing</b> <b>noise</b> {{was heard}} again, and, {{as the two}} gazed in the {{direction}} from which it came, the head of Dan, the detective, appeared from behind the barn.|$|E
60|$|Joe, with {{a troubled}} {{eye in the}} {{direction}} of the cabin, murmured that it did him credit, and Mr-Green made a low, <b>hissing</b> <b>noise,</b> intended to signify admiration. Flower, with a cheery smile, looked round the deck.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly a loud <b>hissing</b> <b>noise</b> {{was heard}} over the side. It sounded to those on deck as if the great sea-serpent had put {{his head out of}} the sea close {{alongside}} and sent a violent hiss into the air.|$|E
60|$|When I {{opened my}} own letter, I found sad news of poor Mr. Engelman. Time and change {{had failed to}} improve his spirits. He complained of a feeling of {{fullness}} and oppression in his head, and of <b>hissing</b> <b>noises</b> in his ears, which were an almost constant annoyance to him. On two occasions he had been cupped, and had derived {{no more than a}} temporary benefit from the employment of that remedy. His doctor recommended strict attention to diet, and regular exercise. He submitted willingly to the severest rules at table--but there was no rousing him to exert himself in any way. For hours together, he would sit silent in one place, half sleeping, half waking; noticing no one, and caring for nothing but to get to his bed as soon as possible.|$|R
6000|$|So Jerry {{knew the}} ecstasy of loving and of being loved {{in the arms}} of his love-god, {{although}} little he knew of such phrases as [...] "king's son" [...] and [...] "son of kings," [...] save that they connoted love for him {{in the same way that}} Lerumie's <b>hissing</b> <b>noises</b> connoted hate. One thing Jerry knew without knowing that he knew, namely, that in the few hours he had been with Skipper he loved him more than he had loved Derby and Bob, who, with the exception of Mister Haggin, were the only other white-gods he had ever known. He was not conscious of this. He merely loved, merely acted on the prompting of his heart, or head, or whatever organic or anatomical part of him that developed the mysterious, delicious, and insatiable hunger called [...] "love." ...|$|R
40|$|A new and {{effective}} approach to recognition of noisy speech is introduced. End-Point-Detection algorithm {{is used to}} measure the noise power and to automatically initiate recording of a spoken word. Unvoiced components of the recorded speech, buried under noise, viz. ambient <b>noise</b> or <b>hiss</b> <b>noise</b> or telephone noise, were then optimally minimized by Finite Impulse Response (FIR) band pass Filter. The speech signal was then sampled and speech features were extracted using low-level and customized Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), which were later dynamically time-warped to find the average minimal distance from Euclidean distance matrices to help facilitate the recognition of speech. For generalization, speech data from three speakers, of three different level of pitch, were collected and were compared to a mid-pitch speaker to establish both speaker independent and speaker dependent efficacy and accuracy. Such a speech recognition system can be both fast {{and effective}} even in quite noisy environments...|$|R
60|$|The oil {{poured out}} in torrents with a sharp, <b>hissing</b> <b>noise</b> that told how great was {{the volume of}} gas imprisoned beneath the rock, which was sending this oily deluge out, and the {{question}} {{of the value of the}} well was decided.|$|E
60|$|The sound increased. It {{was like}} a swirling, <b>hissing</b> <b>noise.</b> Soon they could see by the {{increasing}} light that {{the water of the}} river seemed actually to boil. Immediately afterwards, thousands of turtles came tumbling clumsily out of the water, and spread themselves over the flats.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{there was}} a tearing, <b>hissing</b> <b>noise</b> and a smell of gas. Little looked up and turned pale. The balloon, at what I shall call the pointed end of the Bologna sausage, was evidently {{bursting}} from increased pressure. The gas was escaping, and already they were beginning to descend. Little was resigned but firm.|$|E
60|$|Then he felt Kaa's back grow {{bigger and}} broader below {{him as the}} huge python puffed himself out, <b>hissing</b> with the <b>noise</b> of a sword drawn from a steel scabbard.|$|R
60|$|Somerset {{stopped to}} examine it. The castle was not {{exceptionally}} large, {{but it had}} all the characteristics of its most important fellows. Irregular, dilapidated, and muffled in creepers as a great portion of it was, some part--a comparatively modern wing--was inhabited, for a light or two steadily gleamed from some upper windows; in others {{a reflection of the}} moon denoted that unbroken glass yet filled their casements. Over all rose the keep, a square solid tower apparently not much injured by wars or weather, and darkened with ivy on one side, wherein wings could be heard flapping uncertainly, as if they belonged to a bird unable to find a proper perch. <b>Hissing</b> <b>noises</b> supervened, and then a hoot, proclaiming that a brood of young owls were residing there in the company of older ones. In spite of the habitable and more modern wing, neglect and decay had set their mark upon the outworks of the pile, unfitting them for a more positive light than that of the present hour.|$|R
50|$|In audio engineering, noise {{can refer}} to the {{unwanted}} residual electronic noise signal that gives rise to acoustic noise heard as a <b>hiss.</b> This signal <b>noise</b> is commonly measured using A-weighting or ITU-R 468 weighting.|$|R
60|$|Wi' that, {{my father}} readily {{agreed that the}} receipt should be burnt, and the laird threw it into the chimney with his ain hand. Burn it would not for them, though; but away it flew up the lum, wi' a lang train of sparks at its tail, and a <b>hissing</b> <b>noise</b> like a squib.|$|E
60|$|The <b>hissing</b> <b>noise</b> {{which had}} first {{attracted}} my attention was issuing from its throat, {{and seemed to}} be directed at something beyond and below me which I could not see. The ledge upon which I stood terminated abruptly a few paces farther on, and as I reached the end I saw the cause of the reptile's agitation.|$|E
60|$|The {{instant the}} grizzly bear beheld Dick Varley {{standing}} in his path, he rose on his hind-legs, and made a loud <b>hissing</b> <b>noise,</b> like a man breathing quick, but much harsher. To this Crusoe replied by a deep growl, and showing the utmost extent of his teeth, gums and all; and Dick cocked both barrels of his rifle.|$|E
50|$|The primary vocalization of the {{turquoise}} jay is a short, descending whistle {{that is often}} heard in series. The tone of the whistle is loud and slightly hissy. Other sounds {{the turquoise}} jay can make include popping, squeaking, <b>hissing,</b> and static <b>noises.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Audio {{restoration}} is {{a generalized}} {{term for the}} process of removing imperfections (such as <b>hiss,</b> impulse <b>noise,</b> crackle, wow and flutter, background noise, and mains hum) from sound recordings. Audio restoration can be performed directly on the recording medium (for example, washing a gramophone record with a cleansing solution), or on a digital representation of the recording using a computer (such as an AIFF or WAV file). Record restorationis a particular form of audio restoration that seeks to repair the sound of damaged gramophone records.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe general method of amplification by periodically quenching an unstable system {{under the influence}} of an input signal is investigated by the use of mathematical calculation, digital computation and experimental verification. This type of amplification, of which superregeneration is just one specialized form, is specifically analyzed for electrical systems which can be made unstable with time invarient elements. Specific results from the investigation of a system described by a first order differential equation reveals the physical realizability of an amplificatory mode of operation having unusual selectivity responses. The experimental realizability of this system was accomplished by the development of a special form of dynatron using characteristics heretofore not exploited. Specific results from the investigation of the system described by a second order differential equation revealed fundamental selectivity/ gain limitations for the linear system, a limitation which can be overcome by the use of a time varying regenerative cycle. Both systems demonstrated the capability of having a very high voltage and power gain throughout the audio and radio frequency spectrum. Finally a theoretical and experimental study of the characteristics of the superregenerative <b>hiss</b> (<b>noise)</b> is done in sufficient detail permitting two realizable systems to be developed, both which overcome the objectionable features of the superregenerative hiss[URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
