5|$|Although often inconspicuous, fungi {{occur in}} every {{environment}} on Earth and play very {{important roles in}} most ecosystems. Along with bacteria, fungi are the major decomposers in most terrestrial (and some aquatic) ecosystems, and therefore {{play a critical role}} in biogeochemical cycles and in many food webs. As decomposers, they play an <b>essential</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> nutrient cycling, especially as saprotrophs and symbionts, degrading organic matter to inorganic molecules, which can then re-enter anabolic metabolic pathways in plants or other organisms.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, the Brazilian Navy {{found itself}} well behind its Argentine and Chilean rivals in quality and total tonnage; few ships {{had been ordered}} {{since the fall of}} the Brazilian monarchy in 1889, while Argentina and Chile had just {{concluded}} a fifteen-year naval arms race which filled their navies with modern warships. Rising demand for coffee and rubber was fueling a large increase in the Brazilian government's revenue, and the country's legislature voted to devote some of the proceeds to address this naval imbalance. They believed that building a strong navy would play an <b>essential</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> remaking the country into an international power.|$|E

5|$|Alpine {{symbolism}} {{has played}} an <b>essential</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> shaping {{the history of}} the country and the Swiss national identity. Nowadays some concentrated mountain areas have a strong highly energetic ski resort culture in winter, and a hiking (ger: das Wandern) or Mountain biking culture in summer. Other areas throughout the year have a recreational culture that caters to tourism, yet the quieter seasons are spring and autumn when there are fewer visitors. A traditional farmer and herder culture also predominates in many areas and small farms are omnipresent outside the cities. Folk art is kept alive in organisations all over the country. In Switzerland it is mostly expressed in music, dance, poetry, wood carving and embroidery. The alphorn, a trumpet-like musical instrument made of wood, has become alongside yodeling and the accordion an epitome of traditional Swiss music.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{has been}} the largest {{religion}} in the region since the Early Middle Ages; its existence in Britain {{dates back to the}} late Roman era and the arrival of Celtic Christianity. The Holy Island of Lindisfarne played an <b>essential</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the Christianisation of Northumbria, after Aidan from Connacht founded a monastery there as the first Bishop of Lindisfarne at the request of King Oswald. It is known for the creation of the Lindisfarne Gospels and remains a place of pilgrimage. Saint Cuthbert, a monk of Lindisfarne, was venerated from Nottinghamshire to Cumberland, and is today sometimes named the patron saint of Northern England. Paulinus, as part of the Gregorian mission, became the first Bishop of York. The Synod of Whitby saw Northumbria break from Celtic Christianity and return to the Roman Catholic church, as calculations of Easter and tonsure rules were brought into line with those of Rome.|$|E

5|$|Electrons play an <b>essential</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> {{numerous}} physical phenomena, such as electricity, magnetism, {{chemistry and}} thermal conductivity, {{and they also}} participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions. Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding electric field, and if that electron is moving relative to an observer it will generate a magnetic field. Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources (not those self-produced) will affect the motion of an electron according to the Lorentz force law. Electrons radiate or absorb {{energy in the form}} of photons when they are accelerated. Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as electron plasma by the use of electromagnetic fields. Special telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space. Electrons are involved in many applications such as electronics, welding, cathode ray tubes, electron microscopes, radiation therapy, lasers, gaseous ionization detectors and particle accelerators.|$|E
5|$|Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! is {{the debut}} studio album by the American thrash metal band Megadeth {{released}} on June 12, 1985 {{by the independent}} record label Combat Records. At the beginning of 1985, the band was given $8,000 by Combat to record and produce its debut album. After spending half of the album's budget on drugs, alcohol and food, the band was forced to fire their original producer and produce the album themselves. Despite the resulting poor production, the album was a well-received effort that obtained strong reviews in various music publications. Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! played an <b>essential</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> establishing thrash metal as an authentic subgenre of heavy metal music. It explores themes of death, violence, and occultism.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} {{and management of}} the Vikos–Aoös National Park belongs to two district forest offices, supervised by a forest directorate at the prefecture level. Moreover, the office of World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in the village of Papingo plays an <b>essential</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> management issues. Apart from government efforts, incentives have been given to local management organizations and the local population to participate in the protection of the park. In the park's core, according to the law, forestry activities, grazing, hunting, and fishing are prohibited. In the peripheral zone there are no such restrictions, but the Forest Service can take any necessary measure for the realization of the aims of the park. Apart from the above-mentioned activities, dangers to the park include land erosion, landslides, and wildfires which threaten the local flora and fauna. Another issue is the impact of tourism in recent decades. On the other hand, extreme geophysical conditions make the construction and maintenance of the necessary infrastructure network, mainly access routes and telecommunications, difficult.|$|E

40|$|Summary 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine (5 hmC) is a DNA base {{created during}} active DNA {{demethylation}} by the recently discovered TET enzymes. 5 hmC has <b>essential</b> <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> gene expression and differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that 5 hmC also localizes to sites of DNA damage and repair. 5 hmC accumulates at damage foci induced by aphidicolin and microirradiation and colocalizes with major DNA damage response proteins 53 BP 1 and γH 2 AX, revealing 5 hmC as an epigenetic marker of DNA damage. Deficiency for the TET enzymes eliminates damage-induced 5 hmC accumulation and elicits chromosome segregation defects {{in response to}} replication stress. Our {{results indicate that the}} TET enzymes and 5 hmC play <b>essential</b> <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> ensuring genome integrity...|$|R
5|$|Abundant worldwide, most fungi are {{inconspicuous}} {{because of}} the small size of their structures, and their cryptic lifestyles in soil or on dead matter. Fungi include symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi and also parasites. They may become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an <b>essential</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment. They have long been used as a direct source of human food, in the form of mushrooms and truffles; as a leavening agent for bread; and in the fermentation of various food products, such as wine, beer, and soy sauce. Since the 1940s, fungi have been used for the production of antibiotics, and, more recently, various enzymes produced by fungi are used industrially and in detergents. Fungi are also used as biological pesticides to control weeds, plant diseases and insect pests. Many species produce bioactive compounds called mycotoxins, such as alkaloids and polyketides, that are toxic to animals including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain psychotropic compounds and are consumed recreationally or in traditional spiritual ceremonies. Fungi can break down manufactured materials and buildings, and become significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g., rice blast disease) or food spoilage can have a large impact on human food supplies and local economies.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{evidence that the}} cerebellum plays an <b>essential</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> some types of motor learning. The tasks where the cerebellum most clearly comes into play are those {{in which it is}} necessary to make fine adjustments to the way an action is performed. There has, however, been much dispute about whether learning takes place within the cerebellum itself, or whether it merely serves to provide signals that promote learning in other brain structures. Most theories that assign learning to the circuitry of the cerebellum are derived from the ideas of David Marr and James Albus, who postulated that climbing fibers provide a teaching signal that induces synaptic modification in parallel fiber–Purkinje cell synapses. Marr assumed that climbing fiber input would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be strengthened. Most subsequent cerebellar-learning models, however, have followed Albus in assuming that climbing fiber activity would be an error signal, and would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be weakened. Some of these later models, such as the Adaptive Filter model of Fujita made attempts to understand cerebellar function in terms of optimal control theory.|$|E
