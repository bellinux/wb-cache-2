50|$|Miel d'Alsace is a honey from France that is {{protected}} under EU law with PGI status, first published under relevant laws in 2005. The PGI status covers several varieties of honey produced in Alsace, namely silver <b>fir</b> <b>honey,</b> chestnut honey, acacia honey, lime honey, forest honey, and multi-flower honey.|$|E
50|$|Menalou vanilia <b>fir</b> <b>honey</b> (Μέλι Ελάτης Βανίλια Μαινάλου) is a honey {{produced}} in Greece with protected destination of origin status. It contains at least 80% honey of the {{which will be}} from the black pine, and the rest will be flower honey {{produced in}} the region (<20%) with a pleasant taste and a characteristic appearance with a light colour and sheen; moisture content 14-15.5%, sucrose content <10% (8-18%).|$|E
5000|$|The most rare Pine Honey is the <b>Fir</b> <b>Honey</b> of Mainaloy {{known as}} Banilias (vanilla). It {{comes from the}} black fir forest of Mainalo in Arcadia, Greece, and is famed for its flavor and for the small {{concentration}} of sugars. It is a unique honey with a Protected Name of Origin (POP), and it received {{a gold medal in}} Paris in 1996. It is an uncommon category of honey, with fantastic flavor and a perfume suggestive of candy or vanilla. This type of honey has problems with fluctuations in production. It has less moisture than other honeys, and because of its alkalinity,(i.e. high pH), it never crystallizes [...]|$|E
40|$|International audienceAmino acid {{analysis}} of honey by {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) was used first to discriminate different botanical origins and then to combat adulteration. Pure honeys of seven selected floral varieties were examined. A principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out on the results after selection of the most discriminating parameters. Lavender honeys were thus perfectly characterized, but complete satisfaction was not obtained with the six other varieties. This method (analysis by HPLC and statistical processing by PCA) enabled us to detect the addition of sugar syrup to rape and <b>fir</b> <b>honeys...</b>|$|R
40|$|During {{the liquid}} chromatographic {{study of the}} {{phenolic}} fraction of monofloral honeys was detected in the asphodel honey (Asphodelus microcarpus Salzm. et Viv.) chromatogram a distinctive peak not detected in other monofloral honeys such as Arbutus unedo L., Hedysarum coronarium, Eucalyptus spp., and Galactites tomentosa. After thin layer chromatography (TLC) purification and characterization by NMR and LC-MS/MS, the compound was identified as methyl syringate (MSYR) and confirmed against an original standard. Levels of MSYR were measured in honeys of 2005, 2006, and 2007 by HPLC-DAD analysis. Level determination of MSYR was repeated in 2008 for 2006 and 2007 honeys to evaluate chemical stability of this phenolic compound. Levels of MSYR measured 1 year after the sampling did not show significant statistical differences (p < 0. 05). The stability of MSYR was also confirmed by 12 asphodel honey samples collected in 2005 that showed amounts of methyl syringate comparable with those found in fresh honey. For the evaluation of MSYR origin, samples of nectars were collected from flowers {{and the content of}} MSYR was measured. Levels of MSYR in honeys are originated from the nectar with an average contribution of the nectar to the honey of 80 %. Melissopalinological analysis did not allow the attribution of the honey monofloral origin because levels of asphodel pollen were < 6 % for all analyzed samples. Previously reported levels of MSYR for robinia, rape, chestnut, clover, linden blossom, dandelion, sunflower, thyme, manuka, and <b>fir</b> <b>honeys</b> were < 5 mg/kg. For this reason, a minimum level of 122. 6 mg/kg for MSYR in asphodel honeys can be considered as a chemical marker and, unlike the melissopalynological analysis, can be used for the origin attribution and to evaluate the percent of asphodel nectar in the honey...|$|R
40|$|Three nectar honeys (eucalyptus, {{thyme and}} forest) and two {{honeydew}} <b>honeys</b> (<b>fir</b> and Metcalfa) from Italy were tested for their antibacterial activity against pathogens {{commonly associated with}} wound and burn infections, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREF). All honeys showed bactericidal activity against the microorganisms used, with honeydew honeys being the most effective. They also inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, violacein production in Chromobacterium violaceum, thus demonstrating their ability to affect quorum sensing-regulated biofilm formation. Overall, the results obtained suggest that the honeys examined may have potential for developing natural antimicrobial compositions or dressings {{for the treatment of}} infected wounds or burns...|$|R
50|$|To {{be given}} the PGI designation, the hives {{producing}} the honey must be installed in Alsace. In addition, silver <b>fir</b> <b>honey</b> is given a perimeter of the Alsatian slopes of the Vosges and Jura mountain ranges. Chestnut honey must be gathered in the hills south of the Vosges, in the forests of Brumath and Haguenau. Lime honey must come from the forests of Hardt, Upper Rhine. While the honey collection areas are defined, extraction can take place outside of these areas, provided that traceability is ensured. Traceability of the honey is ensured through record keeping of labels, which are then checked against harvest declarations and stocks. Also, 30 percent of all Miel d'Alsace undergoes microscopic analysis to ensure proof of origin.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{control of}} the floral quality of honey has become a {{priority}} issue {{as a result of}} the number of abuses observed and the relative ease of getting around existing control methods. We conducted chromatographic analyses of honey sugars to determine new criteria for authenticating an origin. The work involved creating databases by analysing a large number of authentic honeys from seven monofloral varieties, followed by statistical processing of the results by a principal components analysis. Differences in composition could thus be demonstrated, such as the presence of trisaccharides in <b>fir</b> <b>honey,</b> that provide an additional tool for authenticating unknow commercial honeys...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{analytical}} {{composition and}} botanical origin of honey are basic data {{used to determine}} the quality of this foodstuff. Although proteins are used to characterise the analytical composition of honey, they can be eliminated during its ultrafiltration and, in the case of honeys not saturated with their own pollen, the use of proteins does not work well. As acidity is a well-known characteristic of honey and organic acids are present at around 0. 5 % in honey, we therefore investigated an alternative method to the protein-based White method, using organic acids as new internal standards instead of proteins. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of 14 organic acids were carried out by ion chromatography with an electrochemical detector. The 13 C/ 12 C isotopic ratios of the honeys, and of the organic acids extracted from them with an anion exchange resin, were determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Gluconic acid is the predominant organic acid in honey, at between 1. 8 and 12. 7 g/kg. For <b>fir</b> <b>honey</b> the major acid is galacturonic acid at around 4. 6 g/kg. The isotopic ratios of honeys and of their acids are strongly linked. Correlations between the δ 13 C values of the honey and the acids were significant, and better than those obtained using proteins. This study has provided a method to differentiate honeys from seven botanical origins, based on organic acid analysis. By combining various organic acid contents and isotopic ratio values through statistical processing by Principal Component Analysis it is possible to differentiate honey samples as a function of their botanical origin...|$|E
40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{power of}} honey {{seems to be}} ascribable to several factors, including oxidative and osmotic stress. The {{aim of this study}} was to find genetic determinants involved in the response to honey stress in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, chosen as model micro-organism. A library of transposon mutants of P. aeruginosa PAO 1 was constructed and only four mutants unable to grow in presence of <b>fir</b> honeydew <b>honey</b> were selected. All four mutants were impaired in the major H 2 O 2 -scavenging enzyme catalase A (KatA). The knockout of katA gene caused sensitivity, as expected, not only to hydrogen peroxide but also to different types of honey including Manuka GMO 220 honey. Genetic complementation, as well as the addition of PAO 1 supernatant containing extracellular catalase, restored tolerance to honey stress in all the mutants. As P. aeruginosa PAO 1 catalase KatA copes with H 2 O 2 stress, it is conceivable that the antimicrobial activity of honey is, at least partially, due to the presence of hydrogen peroxide in honey or the ability of honey to induce production of hydrogen peroxide. The katA-deficient mutants could be used as tester micro-organisms to compare the power of different types of natural and curative honeys in eliciting oxidative stress mediated by hydrogen peroxide...|$|R
40|$|Volatile {{profiles}} of lime tree (Tilia sp.), fir honeydew (Abies alba) and sage (Salvia offici- nalis) honey produced in Croatia {{have been studied}} by using headspace solid phase micro- extraction (HS-SPME) followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) anal- ysis. Melissopalynological and sensory characterization have been performed in order to check the reliability of botanical origin of the samples. In case of sage honey, sensory char- acteristics are reported {{for the first time}} and are rather uniform including: colour charac- terized as beige to jade, depending on the consistency; odour characterized as between light and medium intensity, slightly pungent and wooden; taste characterized as low sweet- ness, expressive acidity and apple caramel, with persistent fruity aftertaste. Characteristic volatile {{profiles of}} the analyzed honeys are described. Taking into consideration similari- ties with lime and <b>fir</b> <b>honey</b> volatile profiles reported in literature, characteristic volatile compounds resulting from qualitative data evaluation are proposed. Sage honey volatile profile has been reported {{for the first time and}} it was found quite different compared to the other studied honeys showing the lowest number of peaks among the studied honeys, 34. Several compounds belonging to the sage honey volatile profile have been identified for the first time in honeys. They include tetrahydro- 2, 2, 5, 5 -tetramethylfuran, 3 -hexenyl es- ter of butanoic acid, 2 -methylbenzene, maltol, methyl ester of 3 -furanocarboxylic acid and benzeneacetic acid. Based on the obtained results and with the lack of comparative litera- ture data, they are proposed as characteristic volatiles for the volatile pattern of sage honey...|$|E
