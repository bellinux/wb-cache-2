40|$|Summary: Previous {{preliminary}} data and case reports have suggested {{an association of}} von Willebrandâ€™s dis-ease (vWD) with factor XI deficiency and platelet abnor-malities. We have analyzed the prevalence of factor XI deficiency and thrombocytopathy in a cohort of Israeli patients with vWD. Decreased factor XI levels (< 67 U/dl) were documented in 35 of 63 (36 %) vWD subjects; factor XI levels were < 30 U/dl in five of 60 (8 %). A significant decline in ADP-induced platelet aggregation (< 30 % of control) was found in 48 % of vWD patients. Likewise, epinephrine-induced aggregation was reduced in 41 %, and collagen-induced aggregation was decreased in 7 % of vWD patients. Logistic regression analysis showed that while <b>Ivy</b> <b>bleeding</b> <b>time,</b> ristocetin cofactor, and ristoce-tin-induced platelet aggregation did not predict bleeding...|$|R

40|$|Ten {{patients}} on chronic intermittent hemodialysis treatment received either unfractionated heparin or {{low molecular weight}} (LMW) heparin K 2165 in a single-blinded randomized cross-over study to assess: effects on hemostasis and ex vivo platelet functions, and effectiveness, i. e. prevention of fibrin formation in the extracorporeal circuit. The 20 dialysis treatments were without untoward side effects, for both drugs used. The variation in the plasma anti-Xa activities was significantly less during K 2165 treatment than during heparinization. No differences between the drugs were observed regarding the <b>Ivy</b> <b>bleeding</b> <b>time,</b> platelet count and platelet aggregation (spontaneous, and induced by ADP and collagen). Plasma platelet factor 4 levels did not increase under K 2165 {{to such an extent}} as under heparin. Both drugs did not influence the plasma levels of beta-thromboglobulin, thromboxane B 2 and platelet serotonin content. K 2165 did not affect platelet adhesion to collagen, in contrast to heparin which substantially inhibited platelet adhesion. Under both treatments, 4 minor clots were observed in 4 artificial kidneys, despite plasma anti-Xa levels in between 0. 19 and 0. 46 U/ml. K 2165 may therefore be considered as effective an anticoagulant as heparin, with less effects on ex vivo platelet function...|$|R
40|$|Desmopressin {{is often}} used for haemostatic {{treatment}} in platelet dysfunction, but the effect kinetics of platelet responses and the mechanism of action are poorly known. This study aimed to determine the kinetics of platelet function responses induced by desmopressin in healthy volunteers treated with aspirin or placebo. Another aim was to correlate platelet responses to changes of von Willebrand factor (vWF) in plasma. We measured platelet function with a glass bead retention <b>test,</b> <b>Ivy</b> <b>bleeding</b> <b>time,</b> vWF:Ag and multimeric structure in plasma. Median baseline platelet retention was 12 % (normal reference range 16 - 27 %) during aspirin treatment and 18 % during placebo. Median peak platelet retention after desmopressin was 33 % during aspirin treatment and 34 % during placebo. After about 3 h platelet function had returned to baseline. A second desmopressin dose after 3 h stimulated platelet retention to a similar extent as the first dose. There was no correlation between platelet responses and quantitative or qualitative changes of vWF in plasma. Platelet count did not change significantly. Thus, desmopressin's effect on platelet function lasts for about 3 h, but may be prolonged by a second dose immediately thereafter. These findings may have important clinical implications for patients with aspirin-induced platelet dysfunction undergoing surgery...|$|R

40|$|The Forkhead box G 1 (FOXG 1) gene encodes a {{transcriptional}} repressor {{essential for}} early {{development of the}} telencephalon. Intragenic mutations and gene deletions leading to haploinsufficiency cause the congenital variant of Rett syndrome. We here describe Rett syndrome-like patients, three of them carrying a balanced translocation with breakpoint in the chromosome 14 q 12 region, and one patient having a 14 q 12 microdeletion excluding the FOXG 1 gene. The hypothesis of long-range FOXG 1 -regulatory elements in this region was supported by our finding of reduced FOXG 1 mRNA and protein levels in platelets and skin fibroblasts from these cases. Given that FOXG 1 is not only expressed in brain but also in platelets, we have studied platelet morphology in these patients and two additional patients with FOXG 1 mutations. Electron microscopy of their platelets showed some enlarged, rounder platelets with often abnormal alpha, and fewer dense granules. Platelet function studies were possible in one 14 q 12 translocation patient with a prolonged <b>Ivy</b> <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> and a patient with a heterozygous FOXG 1 c. 1248 C>G mutation (p.

Dense granule ATP secretion was normal for strong agonists but absent for epinephrine. In conclusion, our study shows that by using platelets functional evidence of cis-regulatory elements in the 14 q 12 region result in reduced FOXG 1 levels in patients' platelets having translocations or deletions in that region. These platelet functional abnormalities deserve further investigation regarding a non-transcriptional regulatory role for FOXG 1 in these anucleated cells...|$|R

In this study, the effects of L-ASP on anticoagulant proteins (protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III) and platelet function were assessed. Material and methods: This was a before-after study on 41 patients with ALL who refered to Mahak hospital (Tehran, Iran). Before and after the injection of L.

40|$|Dental {{patients}} often give {{a medical}} history that suggests {{the possibility of}} a coagulopathy from drugs, with a corresponding risk for prolonged bleeding during and following an invasive procedure. Identification of patients who may be prone to oral bleeding requires specific medical history information and the proper use of laboratory tests. Some NSAIDs are reported to cause prolonged oral bleeding, but scientific evidence is lacking. Likewise, the risk of oral bleeding from anticoagulants such as warfarin is often over stated, and unnecessary adjustment of NSAID or warfarin dosage puts patients at risk for significant morbidity and mortality. Some commonly employed laboratory tests such as the prothrombin time provide helpful information when used in the appropriate setting, but others, such as the <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> <b>test,</b> provide little or no predictive value in the determination of patients at risk for oral bleeding. Dental management of patients with potential coagulopathies from medications requires an understanding of basic principles of coagulation.

MethodsThirty-two patients {{were randomly assigned to}} on-pump or off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. Heparin was given at the same dose. Activation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems was evaluated by measurement of several markers. Platelet function was evaluated by in vitro <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> <b>test.</b> Blood samples were collected at 7 different times, up to postoperative day 6. ResultsOverall tissue factor production was similar in the two groups. Thrombin formation was more elevated in the on-pump group (P <. 001), particularly during the operation; prothrombin fragment 1. 2 discharge values were higher than the preoperative ones (P =. 002). Levels of tissue-plasminogen activator showed no difference between the groups (P =. 1). D-dimers release was higher in the on-pump group (P =. 0002). In vitro <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> was longer in the on-pump group (P <. 0001), particularly in the first 24 hours; it was not prolonged in the off-pump group. In both groups, regardless of aspirin treatment, discharge in vitro <b>bleeding</b> <b>times</b> were lower than the preoperative ones (P <. 01). ConclusionAlthough the extrinsic coagulation pathway is similarly activated, thrombin formation is more pronounced in patients having on-pump bypass grafting. Patients subjected to off-pump bypass grafting have normally functioning platelets and a weak {{activation of}} the fibrinolytic system.

Many conventional medical practitioners, however, do not advise its use for the above complaints due to the herbally prepared Arnica montana mother tincture containing coumarin derivatives which {{are said to have}} an anti-coagulant effect and cause a potential risk of bleeding. The aim of this particular study was to investigate the in vivo effect of the complex remedy Arnica montana composing of potencies 6 C, 30 C and 200 C on coagulation and bleeding. This study forms part of a three part in vivo study to determine the effect of homoeopathic Arnica montana in various potencies on blood coagulation.

The accurate measurement of platelet function is critical for not only identifying patients with either platelet dysfunction or hyperfunction, but is becoming increasingly important for the monitoring of modern anti-platelet therapy. The history of platelet function testing really began only 120 years ago when platelets were first identified as distinct cells (and not fragments) in the blood and it was demonstrated that they were vital for both haemostasis and thrombosis in vivo (Bizzozero, 1882).

40|$|The process ofregulated granule {{secretion}} in platelets {{involves a}} complex molecular machinerythat {{for at least}} in some aspects is highly conserved in other specializedsecretory cells such as neurons. In addition, both platelets and neuronsexpress similar neurotransmitter pathway regulators. Based on these cellularsimilarities, my PhD project focused on the study of platelet function andmorphology in different neurological diseases in order to gain novel insightsin their underlying molecular and biological defects. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, thehomozygous AQP 7 -G 264 V defect wasidentified as cause for the hyperglyceroluria that was present in patients fromthree unrelated families with also a variable degree of mental disability. AQP 7 belongs to the aquaglyceroporin family transporting glycerol and water and withhigh expression in adipocytes and renal proximal tubule cells. AQP 7 deficientmice develop obesity, insulin resistance and hyperglyceroluria. The AQP 7 -G 264 V mutation was previously shownto be associated with disturbed permeability of glycerol in Xenopus oocytes but it was not found tobe associated with obesity or type 2 diabetes in humans. This study shows thatindividuals homozygous for the AQP 7 -G 264 Vmutation have a subclinical platelet secretion defect with reduced ATPsecretion and an absent secondary aggregation wave after epinephrinestimulation. Electron microscopy revealed round platelets with centrallylocated granules and the presence of empty vacuoles. Immunostaining showed AQP 7 colocalisation with dense granules, which seems to be released upon strongplatelet activation. The association of urine glycerol loss and a plateletgranule secretion defect is novel and our findings imply for the first time a rolefor AQPs in platelet secretion. The functional significance of the AQP 7 -G 264 V variant in mental disabilitydeserves further studies. In the second and third part of this thesis, platelet studies enabled us to betterunderstand the biological defective pathways in two neurological disorders witha known genetic defect. The congenital variant of Rett syndrome is caused bymutations in the transcription factor FOXG 1. It was recently suggested that this syndrome can also be due to the disruptionof FOXG 1 long-range regulatory elements by 14 q 12 translocations or chromosomalmicrodeletions that do not harbor the FOXG 1 gene itself. This hypothesis was supported by our finding of reduced FOXG 1 mRNA and protein levels in platelets and skin fibroblasts from these cases. Electron microscopy of their plateletsshowed rounder platelets with often abnormal alpha and fewer dense granules. Functional platelet studies were possible in one 14 q 12 translocation patientwith a prolonged <b>Ivy</b> <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> and a patient with a heterozygous FOXG 1 p. Tyr 416 X mutation. Both patients havea prolonged PFA 100 occlusion time after activation with collagen andepinephrine, and aggregations with a low dose of ADP and epinephrine were alsoreduced while ATP secretion was normal. These functional platelet abnormalitiesdeserve further investigation regarding a non-transcriptional regulatory rolefor FOXG 1 in these anucleated cells. In the third part of this thesis the biologicalrole of ATP 1 A 3 and the mechanism for its dysfunction in AHC were investigated. Platelets from 9 AHC patients with ATP 1 A 3 mutations have structural and functional abnormalities related to granulespositive for the lysosomal marker CD 63. Similar structural granuleabnormalities were detected in the patientsÂ’ fibroblasts. We found 93 proteinsthat were differentially expressed in AHC using a proteomic analysis ofplatelets and fibroblasts. These proteins are predicted to be mainly involvedin metabolism. Interestingly, 7 of them were detected in both cell types, includingthe lysosomal protein cathepsin. AHC fibroblasts have significantly increasedlevels of activated cathepsin B that was associated with increased intrinsicapoptosis. This is the first study that links ATP 1 A 3 defects in AHC to a platelet and fibroblast lysosomal defectwith evidence of increased apoptosis. Further studies, however, are needed todefine how this lysosomal defect is related to decreased ATPase activity. nrpages: 154 status: publishe...|$|R

The studies so far available indicate that repeated estrogen administrations are necessary to short <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> in uremia in a dose range of 95 to 325 mg. With the present study we wanted to establish whether single or repeated doses are required to induce a significant shortening of <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> in uremia, and the minimum cumulative dose of conjugated estrogens necessary to control <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> for a prolonged period of time, and to check whether the prolonged effect of estrogens on <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> in uremia is due to an accumulation of the drug or its metabolites in the blood. Fifteen uremics on chronic hemodialysis were studied. A pilot study carried out in five uremic patients indicated that single or repeated estrogen infusions of 0. 3 mg/kg did not significantly influence <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> values. Therefore the subsequent studies {{have been carried out}} using daily infusion of 0. 6 mg/kg. A single estrogen infusion of 0. 6 mg/kg shortened <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> in all patients. The effect was transient and <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> returned to pre-infusion values within 72 hours. A 50 % decrease of <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> or a shortening of <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> more than 30 to 15 minutes or less was obtained in all patients with four or five infusions (0. 6 mg/kg) spaced 24 hours apart. The effect lasted for 14 days. At day 25 from the last infusion all the patients had <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> values comparable with the pre-infusion ones. Pharmacokinetic parameters of both estrone sulfate and equilin sulfate, the major components of the estrogen mixture we used, were comparable in both controls and uremics and can be described assuming a two compartmental model. After repeated administrations of conjugated estrogens no accumulation of estrone sulfate and equilin sulfate or their metabolites was detectable in blood in both uremics and controls...|$|R

Normal ranges of <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> and volume of blood {{used in the}} test have been defined in a population including preterm babies.

40|$|Background: <b>Bleeding</b> <b>time</b> {{has been}} used for a long time as a global test of {{platelet}} function. Due to a number of pitfalls the test has been losing popularity. This study was designed to determine the prevalence of prolonged <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> in Nigerians with chron-ic liver disease in relation to other indices of hemostasis. Methods: <b>Bleeding</b> <b>time,</b> platelet count, prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were determined in patients with chronic liver disease seen over a twenty-eight-month period. Liver disease severity was graded using Childâ€™s score. Results: Only 14 of 164 (8. 5 %) patients with chronic liver disease had prolonged <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> while 60 patients (36. 6 %) had signifi-cantly prolonged PT. Thirty seven patients (22. 6 %) had prolonged aPTT. <b>Bleeding</b> <b>time</b> showed positive correlation with PT and aPTT but negative correlation with platelet count. Conclusions: <b>Bleeding</b> <b>time</b> is not sensitive in detecting disorders of hemostasis in patients with chronic liver disease although it cor-relates significantly with other indices of hemostasis...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{cirrhosis}} {{suffer from}} a complex haemostatic disturbance, due to abnormalities in clotting and fibrinolytic system activation and in primary haemostasis. The latter is indicated by a prolongation of <b>bleeding</b> <b>time,</b> which is a reliable indicator of platelet function in vivo. To further assess the relationship between <b>bleeding</b> <b>time,</b> degree of liver failure and clotting abnormalities in patients with cirrhosis, <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> was investigated in a prospective study of 70 consecutive patients with cirrhosis diagnosed by liver-needle biopsy, of whom 19 belonged to Child-Pugh class A, 29 to B and 22 to C. Among patients with cirrhosis, 40 % had an abnormal <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> (> 10 min), and 42 % had a platelet count < 100, 000 /microliters. Patients with severe liver failure (class C) had a lower platelet count and a more prolonged <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> than patients in classes A and B. <b>Bleeding</b> <b>time</b> was significantly inversely correlated to platelet count, fibrinogen, prothrombin activity and packed cell volume, and directly correlated to serum bilirubin and D-dimer. However, in class C patients, only a significant inverse correlation between <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> and fibrinogen was observed. These findings indicate that in cirrhosis worsening of platelet function {{is closely related to}} the degree of liver failure. The inverse correlation between <b>bleeding</b> <b>time</b> and fibrinogen indicates that a low value of this clotting parameter may account in part for platelet dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{cirrhosis}} {{can have}} abnormalities in laboratory tests reflecting changes in primary haemostasis, including <b>bleeding</b> <b>time,</b> platelet function <b>tests,</b> markers of platelet activation, and platelet count. Such {{changes have been}} considered particularly relevant in the bleeding complications that occur in cirrhosis. However, several {{studies have shown that}} routine diagnostic tests, such as platelet count, <b>bleeding</b> <b>time,</b> PFA- 100, thromboelastography are not clinically useful to stratify bleeding risk in patients with cirrhosis. Moreover, treatments used to increase platelet count or to modulate platelet function could potentially do harm. Consequently the optimal management of bleeding complications is still a matter of discussion. Moreover, {{in the last two decades}} there has been an increased recognition that not only bleeding but also thrombosis complicates the clinical course of cirrhosis. Thus, we performed a literature search looking at publications studying both qualitative and quantitative aspects of platelet function to verify which primary haemostasis defects occur in cirrhosis. In addition, we evaluated the contribution of qualitative and quantitative aspects of platelet function to the clinical outcome in cirrhosis and their therapeutic management according to the data available in the literature. From the detailed analysis of the literature, it appears clear that primary haemostasis may not be defective in cirrhosis, and a low platelet count should not necessarily be considered as an automatic index of an increased risk of bleeding. Conversely, caution should be observed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia where its correction is advised if bleeding occurs and before invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
