50|$|Near {{infrared}} (IR) array <b>flame</b> <b>detectors</b> (0.7 to 1.1 µm), {{also known}} as visual <b>flame</b> <b>detectors,</b> employ flame recognition technology to confirm fire by analyzing near IR radiation using a charge-coupled device (CCD). A near Infrared(IR) sensor is especially able to monitor flame phenomena, without too much hindrance from water and water vapour. Pyroelectric sensors operating at this wavelength can be relatively cheap. Multiple channel or pixel array sensors monitoring flames in the near IR band are arguably the most reliable technologies available for detection of fires. Light emission from a fire forms {{an image of the}} flame at a particular instant. Digital image processing can be utilized to recognize flames through analysis of the video created from the near IR images.|$|E
50|$|Dual IR (IR/IR) <b>flame</b> <b>detectors</b> {{compare the}} {{threshold}} signal in two infrared ranges. Often one sensor {{looks at the}} 4.4 micrometer carbon dioxide (CO2), while the other sensor looks at a reference frequency.

50|$|The {{range of}} a flame {{detector}} is highly determined by the mounting location. In fact, when making a projection, one should imagine in what the flame detector “sees”. A rule of thumb is, that the mounting height of the flame detector is {{twice as high as}} the highest object in the field of view. Also the accessibility of the flame detector must be taken into account, because of maintenance and/or repairs. A rigid light-mast with a pivot point is for this reason recommendable. A “roof” on top of the flame detector (30 x 30 cm, 1 x 1-foot) prevents quick pollution in outdoor applications. Also the shadow effect must be considered. The shadow effect can be minimized by mounting a second flame detector in the opposite of the first detector. A second advantage of this approach is, that the second flame detector is a redundant one, in case the first one is not working or is blinded. In general, when mounting several <b>flame</b> <b>detectors,</b> one should let them “look” to each other not let them look to the walls. Following this procedure blind spots (caused by the shadow effect) can be avoided and a better redundancy can be achieved than if the <b>flame</b> <b>detectors</b> would “look” from the central position into the area to be protected. The range of <b>flame</b> <b>detectors</b> to the 30 x 30 cm, 1 x 1-foot industry standard fire is stated within the manufacturers data sheets and manuals, this range can be affected by the previously stated de-sensitizing effects of sunlight, water, fog, steam and blackbody radiation.|$|E
5000|$|This law {{is equally}} valid for all optical <b>flame</b> <b>detectors,</b> {{including}} video based ones.

50|$|Infrared <b>flame</b> <b>detectors</b> {{suffer from}} Infrared heat {{radiation}} {{which is not}} emitted by the possible fire. One could say that the fire can be masked by other heat sources. All objects which have a temperature higher than the absolute minimum temperature (0 kelvins or −273.15 °C) emit energy and at room temperature (300 K) this heat is already {{a problem for the}} infrared <b>flame</b> <b>detectors</b> with the highest sensitivity. Sometimes a moving hand is sufficient to trigger an IR flame detector. At 700 K a hot object (black body) starts to emit visible light (glow). Dual- or multi-infrared detectors suppress the effects of heat radiation by means of sensors which detect just off the CO2 peak; for example at 4.1 µm. Here it is necessary that there is a large difference in output between the applied sensors (for example sensor S1 and S2 in the picture). A disadvantage is that the radiation energy of a possible fire must be much bigger than the present background heat radiation. In other words, the flame detector becomes less sensitive. Every multi infrared flame detector is negatively influenced by this effect, regardless how expensive it is.|$|E

50|$|A <b>flame</b> <b>detector</b> is {{a sensor}} {{designed}} {{to detect and}} respond to the presence of a flame or fire, allowing flame detection. Responses to a detected flame depend on the installation, but can include sounding an alarm, deactivating a fuel line (such as a propane or a natural gas line), and activating a fire suppression system. When used in applications such as industrial furnaces, their role is to provide confirmation that the furnace is properly lit; in these cases they take no direct action beyond notifying the operator or control system. A <b>flame</b> <b>detector</b> can often respond faster and more accurately than a smoke or heat detector due to the mechanisms it uses to detect the flame.|$|R
5000|$|Alkali <b>Flame</b> <b>Detector,</b> AFD or Alkali <b>Flame</b> Ionization <b>Detector,</b> AFID. AFD {{has high}} {{sensitivity}} to nitrogen and phosphorus, similar to NPD. However, the alkaline metal ions are supplied with the hydrogen gas, {{rather than a}} bead above the flame. For this reason AFD does not suffer the [...] "fatigue" [...] of he NPD, but provides a constant sensitivity over long period of time. In addition, when alkali ions are not added to the flame, AFD operates like a standard FID.|$|R
5000|$|The sun emits an {{enormous}} amount of energy, which would be harmful to human beings if not for the vapours and gases in the atmosphere, like water (clouds), ozone, and others, through which the sunlight is filtered. In the figure it can clearly be seen that [...] "cold" [...] CO2 filters the solar radiation around 4.3 µm. An Infrared detector which uses this frequency is therefore solar blind. Not all manufacturers of <b>flame</b> <b>detectors</b> use sharp filters for the 4.3 µm radiation and thus still pick up quite an amount of sunlight. These cheap <b>flame</b> <b>detectors</b> are hardly usable for outdoor applications. Between 0.7 µm and approx. 3 µm there is relatively large absorption of sunlight. Hence, this frequency range is used for flame detection by a few flame detector manufacturers (in combination with other sensors like ultraviolet, visible light, or near infrared). The big economical advantage is that detector windows can be made of quartz instead of expensive sapphire. These electro-optical sensor combinations also enable the detection of non-hydrocarbons like hydrogen fires without the risk of false alarms caused by artificial light or electrical welding.|$|E
50|$|The cone {{of vision}} of a flame {{detector}} {{is determined by the}} shape and size of the window and the housing and the location of the sensor in the housing. For infrared sensors also the lamination of the sensor material plays a part; it limits the cone of vision of the flame detector. A wide cone of vision does not automatically mean that the flame detector is better. For some applications the flame detector needs to be aligned precisely to take care that it does not detect potential background radiation sources. The cone of vision of the flame detector is three dimensional and is not necessarily perfectly round. The horizontal angle of vision and the vertical angle of vision often differ; this is mostly caused by the shape of the housing and by mirroring parts (meant for the self test). Different combustibles can even have a different angle of vision in the same flame detector. Very important is the sensitivity at angles of 45°. Here at least 50% of the maximum sensitivity at the central axis must be achieved. Some <b>flame</b> <b>detectors</b> here achieve 70% or more. In fact these <b>flame</b> <b>detectors</b> have a total horizontal angle of vision of more than 90°, but most of the manufacturers do not mention this. A high sensitivity on the edges of the angle of vision provides advantages for the projection of a flame detector.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the heat}} sensing {{elements}} {{present in the}} automatic sprinklers have been removed (resulting in open sprinklers), the deluge valve must be opened as signaled by a fire alarm system. The type of fire alarm initiating device is selected mainly based on the hazard (e.g.pilot sprinklers, smoke detectors, heat detectors, or optical <b>flame</b> <b>detectors).</b> The initiation device signals the fire alarm panel, which in turn signals the deluge valve to open. Activation can also be manual, depending on the system goals. Manual activation is usually via an electric or pneumatic fire alarm pull station, which signals the fire alarm panel, which in turn signals the deluge valve to open.|$|E

50|$|Triple-IR <b>flame</b> <b>detectors</b> compare three {{specific}} wavelength bands {{within the}} IR spectral region and their ratio to each other. In this case one sensor {{looks at the}} 4.4 micrometer range while the other sensors look at reference wavelengths both above and below 4.4. This allows the detector to distinguish between non-flame IR sources and actual flames which emit hot CO2 in the combustion process. As a result, both detection range and immunity to false alarms can be significantly increased. IR3 detectors can detect a 0.1m2 (1 ft2) gasoline pan fire at up to 65 m (215 ft) in less than 5 seconds. Triple IRs, like other IR detector types, are susceptible to blinding by a layer {{of water on the}} detector's window.|$|E
5000|$|Hydrogen {{collects}} under {{roofs and}} overhangs, where it forms an explosion hazard; any building {{that contains a}} potential source of hydrogen should have good ventilation, strong ignition suppression systems for all electric devices, and preferably be designed to have a roof that can be safely blown away {{from the rest of}} the structure in an explosion. It also enters pipes and can follow them to their destinations. Hydrogen pipes should be located above other pipes to prevent this occurrence. Hydrogen sensors allow for rapid detection of hydrogen leaks to ensure that the hydrogen can be vented and the source of the leak tracked down. As in natural gas, an odorant can be added to hydrogen sources to enable leaks to be detected by smell. While hydrogen flames can be hard to see with the naked eye, they show up readily on UV/IR <b>flame</b> <b>detectors.</b> Chemo-chromic indicators can be added to silicone tapes for hydrogen detection purposes. http://www.detectape.com/ ...|$|E
50|$|Following a 1999 {{accident}} in the Mont Blanc tunnel, measures were taken {{at the start of}} 2000 to improve safety in the tunnel. A strict 70 km/h speed limit, and a safe distance of 150 m between vehicles was imposed. The tunnel was equipped with the latest smoke and <b>flame</b> <b>detectors,</b> and a system of videocameras in the tunnel to detect the speed of traffic, as well as fire and smoke. Temperature sensors were installed at short distances throughout the tunnel, monitored from a central control post. Fire hydrants were installed every 130 m, fed from large water tanks. There are 11 safety points along the tunnel, equipped with telephones and loud speakers connected to the control room, with a separate ventilation duct to supply fresh air. These are separated from the main tunnel by two fire doors; the outer door closes automatically when the temperature in the tunnel reaches a certain level. Finally there is a ‘thermal gate’ system at each entrance to identify any overheating vehicles.|$|E

5000|$|Infrared (IR) or {{wideband}} infrared (1.1 µm and higher) <b>flame</b> <b>detectors</b> {{monitor the}} infrared spectral band for specific patterns given off by hot gases. These are sensed using a specialized fire-fighting thermal imaging camera (TIC), {{a type of}} thermographic camera. False alarms {{can be caused by}} other hot surfaces and background thermal radiation in the area. Water on the detector's lens will greatly reduce the accuracy of the detector, as will exposure to direct sunlight. A special frequency range is 4.3 to 4.4 µm. This is a resonance frequency of CO2. During burning of a hydrocarbon (for example, wood or fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas) much heat and CO2 is released. The hot CO2 emits much energy at its resonance frequency of 4.3 µm. This causes a peak in the total radiation emission and can be well detected. Moreover, the [...] "cold" [...] CO2 in the air is taking care that the sunlight and other IR radiation is filtered. This makes the sensor in this frequency [...] "Solar blind", however sensitivity is reduced by sunlight. By observing the flicker frequency of a fire (1 to 20 Hz) the detector is made less sensitive to false alarms caused by heat radiation, for example caused by hot machinery. Multi-Infrared detectors make use of algorithms to suppress the effects of background radiation (blackbody radiation), again sensitivity is reduced by this radiation.|$|E
