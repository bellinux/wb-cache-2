50|$|Bio-energy {{with carbon}} capture and storage (BECCS) is a future {{greenhouse}} gas mitigation technology which produces negative {{carbon dioxide emissions}} by combining bioenergy (<b>energy</b> <b>from</b> <b>biomass)</b> use with geologic {{carbon capture and storage}}. The concept of BECCS is drawn from the integration of trees and crops, which extract carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere as they grow, the use of this biomass in processing industries or power plants, and the application of carbon capture and storage via CO2 injection into geological formations. There are other non-BECCS forms of carbon dioxide removal and storage that include technologies such as biochar, carbon dioxide air capture and biomass burial.|$|E

50|$|The New Scientist {{described}} a scenario in a September 2016 article which illustrated why the journal believed bioenergy can be bad: Suppose you cut down a 50-year oak tree {{in your garden}} and use the logs to heat your house instead of coal. Wood emits more carbon dioxide than coal per unit of heat gained and the roots left in the soil emit more carbon dioxide as they rot. If you plant another tree it will soak up that carbon dioxide in about 50 years. But if you had left the original tree in place it would have soaked up the carbon dioxide from the coal and more. It could take centuries before cutting down the tree would give any benefit. But the world needed to cut carbon dioxide {{over the next few}} decades if the global warming was to be kept below 3 degrees C. The journal also concluded that official claimed carbon reductions from renewables had been overstated. The European Union, for example, got more 64% of its renewable <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> <b>biomass</b> (mostly wood) but United Nations and EU rules did not count the carbon emissions from burning biomass.|$|E

Aspects that {{are taken into account}} are costs, macroeconomic effects (i. e. changes in GDP and national employment), energy balance and environmental effects. Several cases are analysed: in all cases the importing country is the Netherlands. Exporting countries are Sweden, Estonia and Ecuador. In each country several biomass sources available for export are considered like forestry residues and energy crops. In addition several transport routes are studied like shipment of unprepared biomass, upgraded biomass or biofuels and international transport of the biomass as electricity. Research so far concerns the import of Swedish <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> <b>biomass</b> by the Netherlands. Five chains that all result in the delivery of electricity to the Netherlands have been analysed. General conclusions are that the total costs are lowest when the biomass is imported as electricity and that for all chains the macro-economic effects are larger in Sweden than in the Netherlands. Compared to the current costs of electricity in the Netherlands, the electricity from biomass imported from Sweden is expensive...|$|E
