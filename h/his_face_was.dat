5|$|Soviet leader Joseph Stalin {{fell ill}} with {{smallpox}} {{at the age}} of seven. <b>His</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> badly scarred by the disease. He later had photographs retouched to make his pockmarks less apparent.|$|E
5|$|He {{suffered}} major {{injuries in}} both of his final two seasons with Vancouver. On November 20, 2014 he tore his groin during {{a game against the}} Anaheim Ducks. On December 9, 2015 during a match against the New York Rangers, <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> struck by a Dan Boyle slapshot, breaking his jaw. Both injuries resulted in him missing two months' worth of games.|$|E
5|$|I {{talked with}} one soldier who lay {{shivering}} in a bunk {{in the hospital}} coach. He had no visible sign of injury but <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> a ghastly green shade. He wanted more blankets and a cigarette, and I gave him both. An hour later, I helped move his body to the other coach.|$|E

[...] "Allemachter! <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> the <b>face</b> of that English lord who visited {{us with the}} lawyer {{more than fifty years}} ago.

5|$|Judy Taylor, {{author of}} several books about Potter and her works, observes that Potter had {{difficulty}} drawing the human form, and, {{as a result of her}} limitations, restricted depictions of Mr. McGregor in The Flopsy Bunnies to his hands and feet. Any awkwardness in their depictions was minimized by presenting his hands and feet in isolation and from the bunnies' point of view. In the few full-length illustrations of Mr. McGregor, the need to depict <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> eliminated by presenting him in the middle or far distance and from the rear.|$|E
5|$|Gardstein's {{body was}} removed {{to a local}} {{mortuary}} where <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> cleaned, his hair brushed, his eyes opened and his photograph taken. The picture, and descriptions {{of those who had}} helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings, were distributed on posters in English and Russian, asking locals for information. About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End, spreading details of those they were looking for. A local landlord, Isaac Gordon, reported one of his lodgers, Nina Vassilleva, after she had told him she {{had been one of the}} people living at Exchange Buildings. Wensley questioned the woman, finding anarchist publications in her rooms, along with a photograph of Gardstein. Information began to come in from the public and the group's associates: on 18 December Federoff was arrested at home, and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, he starred {{alongside}} Melissa Leo in Why Stop Now, a {{drama about}} a drug addict mother (Leo) and her piano prodigy son (Eisenberg), and in the magical realist romantic comedy To Rome with Love, directed by Woody Allen. That same year, he filed a $3million lawsuit against the producers of the 2010 direct-to-DVD film Camp Hell, claiming exploitation. According to the lawsuit, Eisenberg agreed {{to appear in the}} film as a favor to his friends. He was on set for one day of filming in 2007, earned about $3,000, and logged only a few minutes of total screentime. Because of his minimal involvement in the production, he was surprised to see that <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> prominently featured {{on the cover of the}} DVD, implying that he starred in the film. His lawsuit asserts various California law causes of action, including claims for unfair business practices and publicity rights.|$|E

5|$|On 4 October 1943, Smith {{took off}} from Idku at dawn in a Hurricane Mk IIC to escort a {{shipping}} convoy. Light was extremely poor, and Smith's throttle malfunctioned; he failed to take off quickly enough to clear a blast wall {{at the end of}} the runway. The undercarriage of the aircraft scraped against some sandbags on the wall, causing Smith to lose control of the plane and crash. The shoulder straps on his harness, built to withstand stress of up to , snapped, and <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> smashed against the Hurricane's gyrosight. Smith suffered serious facial injuries, and broke his jaw, a leg and a shoulder. Doctors thought at first that his back had also been broken, but it had only been buckled.|$|E
5|$|Elections {{were held}} in May 1963, pitting Kenyatta's KANU against KADU, the Akamba People's Party, and various {{independent}} candidates; the former were victorious with 83 seats out of 124. On 1 June 1963, Kenyatta {{was sworn in as}} prime minister of the autonomous Kenyan government. He was the country's first Prime Minister to come from its indigenous population. Kenya remained a monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state. In November 1963, Kenyatta's government introduced a law making it a criminal offence to disrespect the Prime Minister, with exile as a punishment. Kenyatta's personality became a central aspect of the creation of the new state. In December, Nairobi's Delaware Avenue was renamed Kenyatta Avenue, and a bronze statue of him was erected beside the country's National Assembly. Photographs of Kenyatta were widely displayed in shop windows, and a likeness of <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> also printed on the new currency. In 1964, Oxford University Press published a collection of Kenyatta's speeches under the title of Harambee!.|$|E
5|$|The more skin left {{unarmoured}} and exposed, {{the lower}} a gladiator's {{status and the}} greater his perceived effeminacy. Likewise, the engulfing net may {{have been seen as}} a feminine symbol. The light arms and armour of the retiarius thus established him as the lowliest, most disgraced, and most effeminate of the gladiator types. Helmets allowed both gladiators and spectators to dehumanise the fighters; when an arena combatant had to kill a comrade-at-arms, someone he probably lived and trained with every day, his opponent's helmet added an extra layer of separation. However, the retiarius was allowed no head protection; <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> visible to all. The emperor Claudius had all net-fighters who lost in combat put to death so that spectators could enjoy their expressions of agony. The retiariuss fighting style was another strike against him, as reliance on speed and evasion were viewed as undignified in comparison to the straightforward trading of blows. The retiarii lived in the worst barracks. Some members of the class trained to fight as Samnites, another gladiator type, in order to improve their status.|$|E
60|$|She {{waited for}} him like the glow of light, and as if <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>were</b> covered. And he dared not lift <b>his</b> <b>face</b> to look at her.|$|R

5000|$|Love Thadani (uncredited) as [...] "Bro"/Jesus Christ - Santino's mysterious supernatural friend, {{who is the}} {{supposed}} source of his healing powers. In scenes where He speaks to Santino, <b>His</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> hidden and remains so throughout the series. Camera angles used to obscure <b>His</b> <b>face</b> <b>are</b> from behind Him, hair covering the sides of <b>His</b> <b>face</b> (for side shots), a view of His torso part with the head offscreen (when seated), and other forms. In the [...] "afterlife" [...] scenes in the finale, sunlight obscures <b>His</b> <b>face</b> when cameras <b>are</b> focused on Him and {{before the end of}} the afterlife scenes, He is seen in silhouette.|$|R
25|$|<b>His</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> swarthy, so brown {{that his}} white teeth flashed in startling {{contrast}} to his skin; his eyes—tired, bored, but courteous.|$|E
25|$|Moyles has {{provided}} his voice and/or likeness {{to a number}} of films and games. <b>His</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> used in , and his voice can be heard in the films Wimbledon, War of the Worlds and Robots. In some of these films, his voice was only used for the UK version.|$|E
25|$|During the {{campaign}} of the election of 2003, the DPJ called the election as {{the choice of the}} government between the ruling LDP-bloc and the DPJ, with Kan being presented as the alternative candidate to then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. <b>His</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> used as the trademark of {{the campaign}} against the LDP.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} was portrayed by Sean Connery in the 1989 film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Alex Hyde-White cameoed as the younger Henry in the film's prologue (though <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> not seen, and Connery dubbed his voice). Lloyd Owen played Henry in The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles television series. The character also made appearances in novels and a comic book.|$|E
25|$|He {{was hardly}} more than five feet four inches but carried himself with great dignity. His head was exactly {{the shape of an}} egg, and he always perched it a little on one side. His {{moustache}} was very stiff and military. Even if everything on <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> covered, the tips of moustache and the pink-tipped nose would be visible.|$|E
25|$|On 22 April 2006, in Mannheim, Germany, Klitschko {{defeated}} Chris Byrd for {{a second}} time, this time by technical knockout, in a contest for the IBF and IBO Heavyweight Championships.

25|$|The unknown man had {{a slender}} build, short grey hair, and {{appeared}} to be in his late 50s or early 60s. He stood five feet and ten and a half inches tall with blue eyes and a tan complexion. From witness reports, the man was of Germanic descent and spoke with a thick German accent. He was neatly groomed; <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> shaven and his hair was clean and combed.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} public still didn't know Perret by name, <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> {{starting}} to become familiar. In fact, until 1913, {{the names of}} the director and actors {{were not included in the}} credits due to the studios' near-prohibition. One day, Léonce demanded that Gaumont and Louis Feuillade include the leading actors' names in the credits, a precedent that was soon followed by all the other directors of the time.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} was often bitter and violent. Yushchenko became seriously ill in early September 2004. He was flown to Vienna's Rudolfinerhaus clinic for treatment and diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, accompanied by interstitial edematous changes, {{due to a}} serious viral infection and chemical substances that are not normally found in food products. Yushchenko claimed {{that he had been}} poisoned by government agents. After the illness, <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> greatly disfigured: jaundiced, bloated, and pockmarked.|$|E
