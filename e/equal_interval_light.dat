50|$|The <b>Equal</b> <b>Interval</b> System (EIS) (also {{known as}} the System of Horizontal Composition based on <b>Equal</b> <b>Intervals)</b> is a modern system of music {{composition}} developed by Murphy over a lifetime of research. Several courses based upon the EIS system are taught at Pasadena City College. Many notable composers and arrangers have been students of the <b>Equal</b> <b>Interval</b> System, such as Tom Chase, Gerald Wiggins, Jimmie Haskell, Richard Firth, Mary Ekler, David Blumberg, Steve Marston, Clair Marlo, Dan Sawyer, Don Novello, Don Peake, Danny Pelfrey, Craig Sharmat, Scott Paige, James L. Venable and Oscar Peterson.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This study uses two data sets, Taiwanese {{export values}} as the {{prediction}} varialbe and its foreign exchange spot rates as the auxiliary variable, to discuss two forecasting {{issues in the}} fuzzy time series analysis by using One- and Two-factor models. First, disregarding the length of information period, when window basis is two, a better forecasting result is obtained. Second, the optimum number of partition <b>equal</b> <b>intervals</b> is to select 14 intervals to have the smallest MSE in all models. However, if partitioning the information into more than 14 <b>equal</b> <b>intervals,</b> MSE {{can not be reduced}} but presents a waving pattern...|$|R
40|$|Apparatus for {{doubling}} the data density rate of an {{analog to digital converter}} or {{doubling the}} data density storage {{capacity of a}} memory deviced is discussed. An interstitial data point midway between adjacent data points in a data stream having an even number of <b>equal</b> <b>interval</b> data points is generated by applying a set of predetermined one-dimensional convolute integer coefficients which can include a set of multiplier coefficients and a normalizer coefficient. Interpolator means apply the coefficients to the data points by weighting equally {{on each side of the}} center of the even number of <b>equal</b> <b>interval</b> data points to obtain an interstital point value at the center of the data points. A one-dimensional output data set, which is twice as dense as a one-dimensional <b>equal</b> <b>interval</b> input data set, can be generated where the output data set includes interstitial points interdigitated between adjacent data points in the input data set. The method for generating the set of interstital points is a weighted, nearest-neighbor, non-recursive, moving, smoothing averaging technique, equivalent to applying a polynomial regression calculation to the data set...|$|R

30|$|A few {{classification}} methods, such {{as natural}} breaks, <b>equal</b> <b>intervals</b> and defined interval, {{were used to}} distinguish the susceptibility classes for trial. <b>Equal</b> <b>intervals</b> classification was found not to be useful for its emphasis {{on the amount of}} one class value relative to other classes. Natural breaks are identified that best group similar values and that maximize the differences between classes and not useful for comparing multiple maps built from different underlying information. A series of specified interval sizes can be used to define the classes with different ranges in defined interval methods based on a comprehensive consideration of the data distribution. Moreover, the define interval classification allow comparison of different maps with similar ranges of attribute value.|$|R
