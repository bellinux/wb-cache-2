60|$|It {{was early}} {{next morning when}} Leland {{harnessed}} four horses to the big gang-plough, and, as there was moonlight that night, he still sat behind another four until long after the red sun went down. There were other men he could have bidden {{to do the work}} for him, but he knew the odds against him, and meant to do it himself thoroughly. It was also careful ploughing, and not done in haste, as is most usual in the West, for throughout most of it the clods ran <b>dead</b> <b>smooth</b> and level, without a break to let the grass tussocks through. Their sides, gleaming from contact with the polished steel, were laid towards the prairie, presenting to it a serried phalanx of good, black loam; but where the sod was unusually friable, Leland got down to toil with the spade.|$|E
50|$|The cut of {{the file}} refers to how fine its teeth are. They are defined as (from roughest to smoothest): rough, middle, bastard, second cut, smooth, and <b>dead</b> <b>smooth.</b> A {{single-cut}} file has one set of parallel teeth while a cross-cut or double-cut file has {{a second set of}} cuts forming diamond shaped cutting surfaces. In Swiss-pattern files the teeth are cut at a shallower angle, and are graded by number, with a number 1 file being coarser than a number 2, etc. Most files have teeth on all faces, but some specialty flat files have teeth on only one face or one edge, so that the user can come right up to another edge without damaging the finish on it.|$|E
40|$|BackgroundCell {{transplantation}} improves heart function after myocardial infarction. This {{study investigated}} the survival of implanted cells in normal and infarcted myocardium. MethodsMale rat aortic smooth muscle cells were cultured. For the in vitro study, male smooth muscle cells mixed with female smooth muscle cells or male smooth muscle cells injected into a piece of female rat myocardium were {{used to evaluate the}} accuracy of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to measure Y chromosomes. For the in vivo study, 2 million live or dead male smooth muscle cells were injected into normal or infarcted female myocardium. At 1 hour and 1 and 4 weeks after transplantation, hearts, lungs, and kidneys were harvested for measurement of Y chromosomes. ResultsIn vitro, the accuracy of polymerase chain reaction measurement was excellent in cultured cells (r 2 = 0. 996) and the myocardium (r 2 = 0. 786). In vivo, 1 hour after 2 × 106 cell implantation, live cell numbers decreased to 1. 0 ± 0. 2 × 106 and 1. 1 ± 0. 3 × 106, and dead cell numbers decreased to 0. 9 ± 0. 2 × 106 and 0. 8 ± 0. 2 × 106 in the normal and infarcted myocardium, respectively (P <. 01 for all groups). Lungs and kidneys contained 8. 5 % and 1. 5 % of the implanted cells, but no cells were detected at 1 week. At 1 week, no <b>dead</b> <b>smooth</b> muscle cells were detected in the normal or infarcted myocardium. The numbers of live cells at 1 and 4 weeks were 0. 48 ± 0. 06 × 106 and 0. 27 ± 0. 07 × 106 in normal myocardium and 0. 29 ± 0. 08 × 106 and 0. 18 ± 0. 05 × 106 in infarcted myocardium. ConclusionsOne hour after implantation, only 50 % of smooth muscle cells remained in the implanted area. Some implanted cells deposited in other tissue. Implanted cell survival progressively decreased during the 4 -week study...|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{being used}} in temple events and {{community}} performances, the Electric Flower Car is most {{well known in the}} funereal context. Traditionally, females clad in flamboyant and skimpy underwear would dance, sing and strip {{for the benefit of the}} dead. Statistically, 95.5%n of Taiwanese practice Buddhism, bringing Buddhist burials one of the most widely seen practice across Taiwan, regardless of location, North or South. Traditional Buddhist burial ritual involves an open casket, the sacrifice of pigs, a procession with many people walking a certain distance to [...] "send off" [...] the deceased. In this practice it is believed that the louder and rowdier the procession, the easier it is for the deceased to cross over to the after-life. Rè Naò, meaning [...] "hot and noisy" [...] in the Chinese language is an indispensable element in a funeral. In the Buddhist funereal tradition, it is believed that the quality of the deceased after-life is gauged by the number of people who are present to [...] "send off" [...] the deceased during the funeral. A rowdy procession not only symbolize the status of the deceased as having lived a fulfilling life with an abundance of family and friends, it also creates a celebratory mood that is meant to signify the living's willingness at letting the dead move out of the physical world and thus, ensure the <b>dead's</b> <b>smooth</b> journey into the after-life. It marks a celebration rather than one's mournful passing at a funeral.|$|R
60|$|I {{turned and}} beheld Fujiyama across {{a sea of}} upward-sloping fields and woods. It is about {{fourteen}} thousand feet high--not very much, according to our ideas. But fourteen thousand feet above the sea when one stands {{in the midst of}} sixteen-thousand-foot peaks, is quite another thing from the same height noted at sea-level in a comparatively flat country. The labouring eye crawls up every foot of the <b>dead</b> crater's <b>smooth</b> flank, and at the summit confesses that it has seen nothing in all the Himalayas to match the monster. I was satisfied. Fujiyama was exactly as I had seen it on fans and lacquer boxes; I would not have sold my sight of it for the crest of Kinchinjunga flushed with the morning. Fujiyama is the keynote of Japan. When you understand the one you {{are in a position to}} learn something about the other. I tried to get information from my fellow-traveller.|$|R
40|$|The first {{confirmed}} {{record of}} a smooth hammerhead shark (Sphyrna zygaena) in British waters for 140 years is described. The head section of the specimen was found washed ashore in rela-tively good condition at Portreath, south-west England, in December 2004. Evidence suggests {{it was not a}} fishery discard, and, like most other previous records of this species in British waters, probably came ashore moribund or <b>dead.</b> The <b>smooth</b> hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena) {{is one of the largest}} species of hammerhead shark with a maximum total length of between 3. 7 and 4. 0 m (Compagno, 1984). It has a broad geographical distribution, occupying coastal-pelagic and semi-oceanic habitat of the continental and insular shelves in tropical and warm temperate zones of the Pacific,Atlantic and Indian Oceans. In the eastern north Atlantic it is present in the Mediterranean, extending south to Senegal, and northwards to the British Isles (Compagno, 1984). However, it is consid-ered exceptionally rare in British waters (Gudger, 1947; Wheeler, 1992). This is supported by the very few authenti-cated records of S. zygaena off Britain; 5 records of singl...|$|R

"So {{they came}} up in their joy; and before them the roll of the surges Sank, as the breezes sank <b>dead,</b> into <b>smooth</b> green foam-flecked marble Awed; and the crags of the cliffs, and the pines of the mountains, were silent. So {{they came up}} in their joy, and around them the lamps of the sea- nymphs, Myriad fiery globes, swam heaving and panting, and rainbows, Crimson, and azure, and emerald, were broken in star-showers, lighting, Far in the wine-dark depths of the crystal, the gardens of Nereus, Coral, and sea-fan, and tangle, the blooms and the palms of the ocean. So they went on in their joy, more white than the foam which they scattered, Laughing and singing and tossing and twining; while, eager, the Tritons Blinded with kisses their eyes, unreproved, and above them in worship Fluttered the terns, and the sea-gulls swept past them on silvery pinions, Echoing softly their laughter; around them the wantoning {{dolphins}} Sighed as they plunged, full of love; and the great sea-horses which bore them Curved up their crests in their pride to the delicate arms of their riders, Pawing the spray into gems, till a fiery rainfall, unharming, Sparkled and gleamed on the limbs of the maids, and the coils of the mermen. So they went on in their joy, bathed round with the fiery coolness, Needing nor sun nor moon, self-lighted, immortal: but others, Pitiful, floated in silence apart; on their knees lay the sea-boys Whelmed by the roll of the surge, swept down by the anger of Nereus; Hapless, whom never again upon quay or strand shall their mothers Welcome with garlands and vows to the temples; but, wearily pining, Gaze over island and main for the sails which return not; they, heedless, Sleep in soft bosoms for ever, and dream of the surge and the sea- maids. So they passed by in their joy, like a dream, on the murmuring ripple." ...|$|R
6000|$|Over the sea, past Crete, on the Syrian {{shore to}} the southward, Dwells in the well-tilled lowland a dark-haired AEthiop people, Skilful with needle and loom, {{and the arts}} of the dyer and carver, Skilful, but feeble of heart; for they know not the lords of Olympus, Lovers of men; neither broad-browed Zeus, nor Pallas Athene, Teacher of wisdom to heroes, bestower of might in the battle; Share not the cunning of Hermes, nor list to the songs of Apollo. Fearing {{the stars of the}} sky, and the roll of the blue salt water, Fearing all things that have life in the womb of the seas and the livers, Eating no fish to this day, nor {{ploughing}} the main, like the Phoenics, Manful with black-beaked ships, they abide in a sorrowful region, Vexed with the earthquake, and flame, and the sea-floods, scourge of Poseidon. [...] Whelming the dwellings of men, and the toils of the slow-footed oxen, Drowning the barley and flax, and the hard-earned gold of the harvest, Up to the hillside vines, and the pastures skirting the woodland, Inland the floods came yearly; and after the waters a monster, Bred of the slime, like the worms which are bred from the slime of the Nile- bank, Shapeless, a terror to see; and by night it swam out to the seaward, Daily returning to feed with the dawn, and devoured of the fairest, Cattle, and children, and maids, till the terrified people fled inland. [...] Fasting in sackcloth and ashes they came, both the king and his people, Came to the mountain of oaks, to the house of the terrible sea-gods, Hard by the gulf in the rocks, where of old the world-wide deluge Sank to the inner abyss; and the lake where the fish of the goddess, Holy, undying, abide; whom the priests feed daily with dainties. There to the mystical fish, high-throned in her chamber of cedar, Burnt they the fat of the flock; till the flame shone far to the seaward. Three days fasting they prayed; but the fourth day the priests of the goddess, Cunning in spells, cast lots, to discover the crime of the people. All day long they cast, till the house of the monarch was taken, Cepheus, king of the land; and the faces of all gathered blackness. Then once more they cast; and Cassiopoeia was taken, Deep-bosomed wife of the king, whom oft far-seeing Apollo Watched well-pleased from the welkin, the fairest of AEthiop women: Fairest, save only her daughter; for down to the ankle her tresses Rolled, blue-black as the night, ambrosial, joy to beholders. Awful and fair she arose, most like in her coming to Here, Queen before whom the Immortals arise, as she comes on Olympus, Out of the chamber of gold, which her son Hephaestos has wrought her. Such in her stature and eyes, and the broad white light of her forehead. Stately she came from her place, and she spoke {{in the midst of the}} people. [...] 'Pure are my hands from blood: most pure this heart in my bosom. Yet one fault I remember this day; one word have I spoken; Rashly I spoke on the shore, and I dread lest the sea should have heard it. Watching my child at her bath, as she plunged in the joy of her girlhood, Fairer I called her in pride than Atergati, queen of the ocean. Judge ye if this be my sin, for I know none other.' She ended; Wrapping her head in her mantle she stood, and the people were silent. [...] Answered the dark-browed priests, 'No word, once spoken, returneth, Even if uttered unwitting. Shall gods excuse our rashness? That which is done, that abides; and the wrath of the sea is against us; Hers, and the wrath of her brother, the Sun-god, lord of the sheepfolds. Fairer than her hast thou boasted thy daughter? Ah folly! for hateful, Hateful are they to the gods, whoso, impious, liken a mortal, Fair though he be, to their glory; and hateful is that which is likened, Grieving the eyes of their pride, and abominate, doomed to their anger. What shall be likened to gods? The unknown, who deep in the darkness Ever abide, twyformed, many-handed, terrible, shapeless. Woe to the queen; for the land is defiled, and the people accursed. Take thou her therefore by night, thou ill-starred Cassiopoeia, Take her with us in the night, when the moon sinks low to the westward; Bind her aloft for a victim, a prey for the gorge of the monster, Far on the sea-girt rock, which is washed by the surges for ever; So may the goddess accept her, and so may the land make atonement, Purged by her blood from its sin: so obey thou the doom of the rulers.' [...] Bitter in soul they went out, Cepheus and Cassiopoeia, Bitter in soul; and their hearts whirled round, as the leaves in the eddy. Weak was the queen, and rebelled: but the king, like a shepherd of people, Willed not the land should waste; so he yielded the life of his daughter. [...] Deep in the wane of the night, as the moon sank low to the westward, They by the shade of the cliffs, with the horror of darkness around them, Stole, as ashamed, to a deed which became not the light of the sunshine, Slowly, the priests, and the queen, and the virgin bound in the galley, Slowly they rowed to the rocks: but Cepheus far in the palace Sate in the midst of the hall, on his throne, like a shepherd of people, Choking his woe, dry-eyed, while the slaves wailed loudly around him. They on the sea-girt rock, which is washed by the surges for ever, Set her in silence, the guiltless, aloft with her face to the eastward. Under a crag of the stone, where a ledge sloped down to the water; There they set Andromeden, most beautiful, shaped like a goddess, Lifting her long white arms wide-spread to the walls of the basalt, Chaining them, ruthless, with brass; and they called on the might of the Rulers. [...] 'Mystical fish of the seas, dread Queen whom AEthiops honour, Whelming the land in thy wrath, unavoidable, sharp as the sting-ray, Thou, and thy brother the Sun, brain-smiting, lord of the sheepfold, Scorching the earth all day, and then resting at night in thy bosom, Take ye this one life for many, appeased by the blood of a maiden, Fairest, and born of the fairest, a queen, most priceless of victims.' [...] Thrice they spat as they went by the maid: but her mother delaying Fondled her child to the last, heart-crushed; and the warmth of her weeping Fell on the breast of the maid, as her woe broke forth into wailing. [...] 'Daughter! my daughter! forgive me! Oh curse not the murderess! Curse not! How have I sinned, but in love? Do the gods grudge glory to mothers? Loving I bore thee in vain in the fate-cursed bride-bed of Cepheus, Loving I fed thee and tended, and loving rejoiced in thy beauty, Blessing thy limbs as I bathed them, and blessing thy locks as I combed them; Decking thee, ripening to woman, I blest thee: yet blessing I slew thee! How have I sinned, but in love? Oh swear to me, swear to thy mother, Never to haunt me with curse, as I go to the grave in my sorrow, Childless and lone: may the gods never send me another, to slay it! See, I embrace thy knees--soft knees, where no babe will be fondled-- Swear to me never to curse me, the hapless one, not in the death-pang.' [...] Weeping she clung to the knees of the maid; and the maid low answered-- 'Curse thee! Not in the death-pang!' The heart of the lady was lightened. Slowly she went by the ledge; and the maid was alone in the darkness. [...] Watching the pulse of the oars die down, as her own died with them, Tearless, dumb with amaze she stood, as a storm-stunned nestling Fallen from bough or from eave lies dumb, which the home-going herdsman Fancies a stone, till he catches the light of its terrified eyeball. So through the long long hours the maid stood helpless and hopeless, Wide-eyed, downward gazing in vain at the black blank darkness. Feebly at last she began, while wild thoughts bubbled within her-- 'Guiltless I am: why thus, then? Are gods more ruthless than mortals? Have they no mercy for youth? no love for the souls who have loved them? Even as I loved thee, dread sea, as I played by thy margin, Blessing thy wave as it cooled me, thy wind as it breathed on my forehead, Bowing my head to thy tempest, and opening my heart to thy children, Silvery fish, wreathed shell, and the strange lithe things of the water, Tenderly casting them back, as they gasped on the beach in the sunshine, Home to their mother--in vain! for mine sits childless in anguish! O false sea! false sea! I dreamed what I dreamed of thy goodness; Dreamed of a smile in thy gleam, of a laugh in the plash of thy ripple: False and devouring thou art, and the great world dark and despiteful.' [...] Awed by her own rash words she was still: and her eyes to the seaward Looked for an answer of wrath: far off, in the heart of the darkness, Blight white mists rose slowly; beneath them the wandering ocean Glimmered and glowed to the deepest abyss; and the knees of the maiden Trembled and sunk in her fear, as afar, like a dawn in the midnight, Rose from their seaweed chamber the choir of the mystical sea-maids. Onward toward her they came, and her heart beat loud at their coming, Watching the bliss of the gods, as they wakened the cliffs with their laughter. [...] Onward they came in their joy, and before them the roll of the surges Sank, as the breeze sank <b>dead,</b> into <b>smooth</b> green foam-flecked marble, Awed; and the crags of the cliff, and the pines of the mountain were silent. Onward they came in their joy, and around them the lamps of the sea-nymphs, Myriad fiery globes, swam panting and heaving; and rainbows Crimson and azure and emerald, were broken in star-showers, lighting Far through the wine-dark depths of the crystal, the gardens of Nereus, Coral and sea-fan and tangle, the blooms and the palms of the ocean. [...] Onward they came in their joy, more white than the foam which they scattered, Laughing and singing, and tossing and twining, while eager, the Tritons Blinded with kisses their eyes, unreproved, and above them in worship Hovered the terns, and the seagulls swept past them on silvery pinions Echoing softly their laughter; around them the wantoning dolphins Sighed as they plunged, full of love; and the great sea-horses which bore them Curved up their crests in their pride to the delicate arms of the maidens, Pawing the spray into gems, till a fiery rainfall, unharming, Sparkled and gleamed on the limbs of the nymphs, and the coils of the mermen. [...] Onward they went in their joy, bathed round with the fiery coolness, Needing nor sun nor moon, self-lighted, immortal: but others, Pitiful, floated in silence apart; in their bosoms the sea-boys, Slain by the wrath of the seas, swept down by the anger of Nereus; Hapless, whom never again on strand or on quay shall their mothers Welcome with garlands and vows to the temple, but wearily pining Gaze over island and bay for the sails of the sunken; they heedless Sleep in soft bosoms for ever, and dream of the surge and the sea-maids. [...] Onward they passed in their joy; on their brows neither sorrow nor anger; Self-sufficing, as gods, never heeding the woe of the maiden. She would have shrieked for their mercy: but shame made her dumb; and their eyeballs Stared on her careless and still, like the eyes in the house of the idols. Seeing they saw not, and passed, like a dream, on the murmuring ripple. [...] Stunned by the wonder she gazed, wide-eyed, as the glory departed. 'O fair shapes! far fairer than I! Too fair to be ruthless! Gladden mine eyes once more with your splendour, unlike to my fancies; You, then, smiled in the sea-gleam, and laughed in the plash of the ripple. Awful I deemed you and formless; inhuman, monstrous as idols; Lo, when ye came, ye were women, more loving and lovelier, only; Like in all else; and I blest you: why blest ye not me for my worship? Had you no mercy for me, thus guiltless? Ye pitied the sea-boys: Why not me, then, more hapless by far? Does your sight and your knowledge End with the marge of the waves? Is the world which ye dwell in not our world?' ...|$|R
