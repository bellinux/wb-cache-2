40|$|Short-rib {{polydactyly}} syndromes (SRPS I-V) are a {{group of}} lethal congenital disorders characterized by shortening of the ribs and long bones, polydactyly, {{and a range of}} extraskeletal phenotypes. A number of other disorders in this grouping, including Jeune and <b>Ellis-van</b> <b>Creveld</b> <b>syndromes,</b> have an overlapping but generally milder phenotype. Collectively, these short-rib dysplasias (with or without polydactyly) share a common underlying defect in primary cilium function and form a subset of the ciliopathy disease spectrum. By using whole-exome capture and massive parallel sequencing of DNA from an affected Australian individual with SRPS type III, we detected two novel heterozygous mutations in WDR 60, a relatively uncharacterized gene. These mutations segregated appropriately in the unaffected parents and another affected family member, confirming compound heterozygosity, and both were predicted to have a damaging effect on the protein. Analysis of an additional 54 skeletal ciliopathy exomes identified compound heterozygous mutations in WDR 60 in a Spanish individual with Jeune syndrome of relatively mild presentation. Of note, these two families share one novel WDR 60 missense mutation, although haplotype analysis suggested no shared ancestry. We further show that WDR 60 localizes {{at the base of the}} primary cilium in wild-type human chondrocytes, and analysis of fibroblasts from affected individuals revealed a defect in ciliogenesis and aberrant accumulation of the GLI 2 transcription factor at the centrosome or basal body in the absence of an obvious axoneme. These findings show that WDR 60 mutations can cause skeletal ciliopathies and suggest a role for WDR 60 in ciliogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Ellis-van</b> <b>Creveld</b> (EvC) <b>syndrome</b> is {{characterized}} by short limbs, short ribs, postaxial polydactyly, dysplastic nails and teeth and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. We report a family with complex septal cardiac defects, rhizomelic limb shortening, and polydactyly, without the typical lip, dental, and nail abnormalities of EvC. The phenotype was inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, with one instance of pseudodominant inheritance. Methods Because of the phenotypic overlap with EvC, microsatellite markers were used to test for linkage to the EVC/EVC 2 locus. The results did not exclude linkage, so samples were sequenced for mutations. Results We identified a c. 1868 T>C mutation in EVC, which predicts p. L 623 P, and was homozygous in affected individuals. Conclusion We conclude that this EVC mutation is hypomorphic and that such mutations can cause a phenotype of cardiac and limb defects that is less severe than typical EvC. EVC mutation analysis {{should be considered in}} patients with cardiac and limb malformations, even if they do not manifest typical EvC syndrome. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: <b>Ellis-van</b> <b>Creveld</b> (EVC) <b>syndrome</b> {{is one of}} {{the rarest}} ciliopathy syndromes. It is caused by {{mutations}} of the EVC and EVC 2 genes which encode the EVC proteins present in the basal body of the primary cilium. Presentation of cases: We report on a Saudi family with two affected children. Gene analysis revealed a homozygous c. 2 T >A in exon 1 of the EVC gene. The most interesting finding in our patients was the wide – spread cone-shaped epiphyses in the hands and feet. Discussion: Although cone-shaped epiphyses is a known feature of EVC syndrome, it usually limited to the middle or proximal phalanges. The wide-spread cone-shaped epiphyses seen in our patients have not been previously reported. Conclusion: EVC syndrome is very rare in the Middle East. We report on the first Saudi family with EVC syndrome confirmed by gene analysis. The most unique finding in our patients was the wide-spread cone-shaped epiphyses in the hands and feet. The abnormality is probably related to abnormal Indian hedgehog signaling in the primary cilium...|$|R

50|$|<b>Ellis-van</b> <b>Creveld</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{often is}} the result of founder effects in {{isolated}} human populations, such as the Amish and some small island inhabitants. Although relatively rare, this disorder does occur with higher incidence within founder-effect populations due to lack of genetic variability.

Dandy-Walker malformation is also occasionally seen in <b>Ellis-van</b> <b>Creveld</b> <b>syndrome,</b> which is characterized by heart defects and malformed alveolar ridge. Many disorders include the Dandy-Walker phenotype and thus it is not pathognomonic for 3C syndrome.|$|E

It is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder with variable expressions, due to the mutation of the EVC syndrome 1 and 2 genes, which are located on chromosome 4 p 16. The present case report describes the EVC syndrome in a 14 -year-old girl, who presented with a tetrad of all the cardinal features and other associated features. Additional unusual dental findings such as single-rooted funnel-shaped molars, reduced crown size, enamel hypoplasia, supernumerary teeth, dental fusion, taurodontism, abnormal occlusal anatomy with wide grooves, and atypical cusps have been reported in most previous cases of this syndrome. However, in our patient, surprisingly, the teeth present were relatively non-anomalous, both clinically and radiographically (i. e., with none of the usually found abnormalities mentioned above).

'Six-fingered dwarfism' ('digital integer deficiency') was an {{alternative}} designation {{used for this}} condition when it was being studied in the Amish and may have served a useful function in defining this then little known condition for the medical profession, {{as well as the}} lay public.

During this pregnancy, a prenatal transabdominal ultrasound at 13 + 4 weeks of gestation revealed a nuchal translucency (NT) thickness of 2. 0  mm, an endocardial cushion defect, postaxial polydactyly of bilateral hands, and mesomelic dysplasia of the long bones. Amniocentesis was performed at 13 + 5 weeks of gestation. Results of a cytogenetic analysis revealed a karyotype of 46,XX and that of a molecular analysis revealed compound heterozygous mutations of c. 1195 C>T and c. 871 - 2 _ 894 del 26 in the EVC 2 gene. Prenatal ultrasound at 16 weeks of gestation showed a fetus with short limbs, an endocardial cushion defect, and postaxial polydactyly of bilateral hands. The parents decided to terminate the pregnancy, and a 116 -g female fetus was delivered with a narrow thorax, shortening limbs, and postaxial polydactyly of the hands.
