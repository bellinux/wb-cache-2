The couple moved to Los Angeles, where he became known as Dr. John T. Richter. Shortly afterwards, the couple established a raw vegetarian food restaurant, the Eutropheon (from Greek words meaning [...] "good nourishment"), at 833 South Olive Street. In 1925, Vera Richter published a book, Mrs. Richter’s Cook-less Book, which included many of the food recipes served in the Eutropheon, and received considerable local publicity. The couple favored eating fruit in the morning, green vegetables and nuts for lunch, and root vegetables and nuts in the evening. [...] They were opposed {{to the use of}} coffee, sugar, salt, tobacco, alcohol, meat, dairy products, cooked food, and refrigeration, and promoted massage, <b>heliotherapy,</b> iris diagnosis, sun gazing, barefoot walking, and naturism. [...] They defended the ideals of the Russian Revolution, and supported US socialist leader Eugene Debs. They lectured in the area, promulgated works on health and natural living by German writers such as Arnold Ehret, Louis Kuhne, and Adolf Just, and were regularly patronized and promoted by Los Angeles gymnasium owner, newspaper columnist and radio host Phillip Lovell. The Richters established two further Eutropheon restaurants in southern California, which Lovell described as [...] "the only... restaurants in the country that function without the aid of a cookstove". [...] In 1936, Dr. John T. Richter published Nature the Healer, a book that went through several editions. The widespread use of the term [...] "raw fooder" [...] has been attributed to the Richters.

Especially obstinate are the cases with “late suppuration “, often appearing many years after the active stage of the tuberculosis, when the diseased joint shows no clinical or radiological signs of activity, when the local process is free of symptoms, and the x-ray indicates a consolidation of the tuberculous area.

40|$|Vitamin D {{status in}} {{psoriasis}} patients treated with UVB therapy Amra Osmancevic Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Institute of Clinical Sciences at Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Göteborg, Sweden Abstract The thesis {{deals with the}} effect of ultraviolet B (UVB) 280 - 320 nm on vitamin D production in psoriasis patients during treatment with phototherapy. Background: Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory disease affecting the skin and potentially the joints. Both genetic and environmental factors are important in the aetiology of the disease. Phototherapy (broadband UVB, narrowband UVB (NBUVB) and <b>heliotherapy)</b> is commonly used as treatment of psoriasis. Vitamin D 3, or cholecalciferol, is produced in the basal epidermis by ultraviolet radiation (290 - 315 nm) of 7 -dehydrocholesterol and hydroxylated in the liver to the major circulating metabolite 25 -hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH) D]. Hydroxylation to 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D [1, 25 (OH) 2 D] in the kidneys is stimulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and suppressed by phosphate. Sun exposure is the strongest factor influencing 25 (OH) D. Aims: 1) To study the effect of UVB on vitamin D synthesis in patients with psoriasis. 2) To examine possible differences between NBUVB and broadband UVB on vitamin D production in psoriatic patients. 3) To investigate the effect of UVB induced vitamin D on bone, lipid and carbohydrate status in psoriasis patients. Methods: Serum 25 (OH) D, 1, 25 (OH) 2 D, PTH, calcium and creatinine were measured {{before and after the}} phototherapy in white, Caucasian patients with active plaque psoriasis. Bone mineral density (BMD) was examined using Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) in postmenopausal women with psoriasis. Lipid and carbohydrate status were assessed in patients treated with <b>heliotherapy.</b> Results: Psoriasis improved in all patients, with a 75 % reduction in PASI (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) score on all regimes. Serum 25 (OH) D increased and PTH decreased after phototherapy. The increase in 25 (OH) D was higher in the broadband treated patients compared with NBUVB. There was no correlation between the dose of UVB and the increase of 25 (OH) D. Postmenopausal women with psoriasis had higher BMD both at the hip and at the lumbar spine than age-matched controls. The ratio of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and the levels of glycosylated haemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) decreased during <b>heliotherapy.</b> Conclusion: UVB and <b>heliotherapy</b> increased the serum 25 (OH) D production, reduced the serum PTH concentrations and improved psoriasis, lipid and carbohydrate status in the patients. Vitamin D production in psoriasis patients increased less with NBUVB than with broadband UVB phototherapy. Postmenopausal women with psoriasis had higher BMD than age-matched controls, a finding that could be related to their higher body weight, physical activity and the UVB exposure.
