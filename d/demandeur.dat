40|$|In the 1980 s, {{significant}} differences in the levels of IP protection around the globe triggered unilateral responses of the US as the key <b>demandeur</b> for stronger IP rights. Aspects of this unilateralism in turn served as a trade barrier for the importation of goods from other countries into the US. Some of these US measures were successfully challenged as a breach of international trade rules under GATT. The WTO TRIPS Agreement then created common standards for IP protection and enforcement, including some binding rules on IP as a barrier to trade that were motivated by the pre-TRIPS experiences. Against this background, this contribution questions whether the rules in TRIPS and GATT are still adequate to deal with today’s reality of IP protection and enforcement in and beyond the trade context. This reality is increasingly framed by unilateral, bilateral and regional standards of IP rule-making that go beyond the multilateral norms found in TRIPS and create an increasingly fragmented system of “TRIPS-plus” protection and enforcement of IP rights around the globe. My core argument is that the uncoordinated expansion of TRIPS-plus rules increasingly serves as a barrier to global trade. This in turn begs the question whether the WTO rules on IP (TRIPS) and those on trade in goods (GATT) are—in the words of the overall conceptual framing of this project—“still fit to operate in such a changed environment” and can provide for adequate safeguards against trade barriers. My proposed answer is that for TRIPS and GATT to fulfil this function, they have to be applied in a way which facilitates harmonized, global maximum standards or ceilings for IP protection and enforcement as a necessary counterpart to the familiar minimum standards. These ceilings do exist in GATT and TRIPS, but have been under-used in the first 20 years of the WTO. I suggest that there are indications and good reasons for relying on them more extensively in an effort to mitigate the trade barriers resulting from uncoordinated expansion of TRIPS-plus rules in the last 15 or so years. In addition, in an ideal world, we would be aiming to introduce multilaterally agreed, more specific ceilings ensuring that reasonable limits to IP rights are available on a global scale...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical {{explanations}} for the structuring of transnational commercial law agreements are limited by their focus on the state. Given the dispositive nature of transnational commercial law, this chapter contends that the key actors are private <b>demandeurs,</b> and that agreements are reflective of their preferences and relative power. I have explained {{the limitations of the}} state-centric approach in other works, and do not elaborate on those arguments here. This chapter will limit itself to outlining the central claim, of the demandeur-centric approach for the process of creating transnational commercial law. It demonstrates that agreement design is predicated on two variables - bargaining costs and enforcement costs. The operation of these variables spawns agreements ranging from non-convention agreements, which result when <b>demandeurs</b> possess the ability to strike agreements at low cost and are able to enforce them without much reliance on state actors, to conventions, which result when bargaining and enforcement costs are high...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} the GATS commitments made by WTO {{members on the}} movement of natural persons (mode 4) since {{the completion of the}} Uruguay Round. Two groups of <b>demandeurs</b> exist for liberalisation. The first are developed countries which have sought market access for intra-corporate transferees (ICTs) and professionals. While developing countries were <b>demandeurs</b> during the Uruguay Round negotiations they gained little during the round and have made substantial concessions during the process of WTO accession. These commitments made by developing countries have not only been in the traditional areas such as ICTs but in new areas such as "trading rights", which are GATT commitments with unclear and untested implications for the GATS under mode 3 and mode 4. In the run-up to a new round of negotiations on services, new and very innovative proposals have come from labour-exporting developing countries such as India for the liberalisation of mode 4. The paper considers a wide range of mode 4 proposals made by WTO members, some of which will have profound effects upon global labour markets.

One area of contention is the explicit hierarchy in the level of protection, whereby indications for wines and spirits are offered stronger protection through Article 23 that indications for other products through Article 22. <b>Demandeurs,</b> which include many developing and transition countries, want a removal of this hierarchy with other products being offered protection similar to indications of wines and spirits.

40|$|ABSTRACT. – We present {{models of}} labor-market {{discrimination}} in which identical employers choose among job applicants {{according to a}} continuous characteristic such as skin color or worker height. The characteristic in question {{is assumed to be}} unrelated to worker productivity. Firms are required to announce wage offers that are not conditioned on the characteristic. Workers apply to firms on the basis of those announcements. Firms rank all applicants with respect to the characteristic and select the most desirable one. We show that in equilibrium all firms will offer the same wage, and workers will apply to each firm with equal probability. All employed workers will receive the same wage, but lower ranked workers will have a higher rate of unemployment than higher ranked workers and will thus have a lower expected income. These results differ from those of directed-search models characterized by a finite number of worker types.

40|$|Abstract. Developing {{countries}} did {{not start}} off as <b>demandeurs</b> of global environmental governance. Although they are still rather skeptical about the global environmental enterprise, they {{have come a long}} way from being the vigorous contestants that they were three decades ago. This fascinating evolution has not only changed the views of developing countries but has also transformed the shape of the global environmental discourse, most significantly by turning what used to be global environmental politics into what is now the global politics of sustainable development. This paper charts this evolution by using the twin conceptual lenses of effectiveness and legitimacy and the heuristic markers of the three key global conferences on the global environment (Stockholm 1972; Rio de Janeiro 1992; Johannesburg 2002). The paper argues that the pre-Stockholm era was exemplified by a politics of contestation by the South; the Stockholm-to-Rio period was a period of reluctant participation as a new global compact emerged around the notion of sustainable development; and the post-Rio years have seen the emergence of more meaningful, but still hesitant, engagement by the developing countries in the global environmental project but very much around the promise and potential of actualizing sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|Based on a {{historical}} {{survey of the}} experiences of the USA, the EU member states and the East Asian economies, the paper argues that during their early stages of development, now-developed countries systematically discriminated between domestic and foreign investors in their industrial policy. They have used a range of instruments to build up national industry. They included: limits on ownership; performance requirements on exports, technology transfer or local procurement; insistence on joint ventures with local firms; and barriers to 'brownfield investments' through mergers and acquisitions. On the basis of this, the paper argues that a multilateral investment agreement (MIA) at the WTO, founded on principle of national treatment, is likely to harm the developing countries' prospects for development. Our historical survey shows that, only when domestic industry has reached a certain level of sophistication, complexity, and competitiveness do the benefits of non-discrimination and liberalisation appear to outweigh the costs. As a result, countries generally move towards a greater degree of non-discrimination and liberalisation as they develop. In that sense, contrary to the claims of the <b>demandeurs</b> of the MIA non-discrimination is better seen as an outcome of development, not a causeForeign Investment, Agreements, MIA, Economic History, Competitiveness, Developing Countries...|$|R
40|$|Au Québec, les centres de crise ont été développés dans le contexte de la désinstitutionnalisation, ce qui a mené à une offre de {{services}} devant répondre aux besoins d’une clientèle hétérogène. À ce jour, encore peu d’études ont décrit et comparé les profils cliniques des personnes qui effectuent une demande d’aide à un centre de crise en considérant la présence ou non d’un trouble de santé mentale et {{la nature}} de celui-ci. Les dossiers de 1170 nouveaux <b>demandeurs</b> de services au Centre d’aide 24 / 7 ont été examinés rétrospectivement. Parmi ces <b>demandeurs,</b> 48  % souffraient d’un trouble de santé mentale et, de ceux-ci, 9  % rapportaient un trouble mental grave, soit un trouble psychotique ou bipolaire. Les résultats indiquent que le fait d’avoir un trouble de santé mentale est associé à une probabilité plus élevée de rapporter des événements stressants à caractère interpersonnel, une crise plus intense ainsi que des comportements auto-agressifs. Les personnes ayant un trouble psychotique ou bipolaire sont quant à elles plus fréquemment hébergées et plus susceptibles de recevoir des services intensifs et encadrants. Il semble donc que la présence et le type de troubles de santé mentale des <b>demandeurs</b> d’aide en centre de crise permettent non seulement de mieux anticiper la nature et l’intensité de la crise mais aussi le type de services requis. The mandate of crisis centres varies substantially {{from one country}} to the next according to the government policies in effect. In the United States, crisis centres were developed based on Caplan’s theory, which defines crisis as a psychosocial disorganization following a life event that is resolved with a return to balance. This approach aims at preventing the onset of mental health disorders through short-term intervention. It is different in Quebec, where crisis centres were developed in a deinstitutionalization context and ought to constitute an alternative to hospitalisation. Such mandate of Quebec crisis centres is not necessarily of the preventive nature associated with Caplan’s theory and it has led to services having to be adapted to a heterogeneous clientele {{that may or may not}} suffer from mental health problems. It has implications related to the crisis characteristics such as its nature, intensity, and dangerosity, as well as implications regarding the organization of crisis centre services, which have been the object of few studies so far. Objective: The present study aims at distinguishing clinical profiles of crisis centre callers according to the presence or absence of a mental health disorder and its nature, that is severe and persistent (psychotic or bipolar disorder) or not (mood, anxiety or personality disorder). In order to do so, participants are compared on the characteristics of the crisis and the services they received. Method: In this descriptive study, the files of 1170 new assistance applicants are retrospectively analyzed based on a predetermined grid that was used to collect data according to the main clinical characteristics of persons in distress, as recognized in the literature. The subgroup of persons presenting a psychotic or bipolar disorder was examined separately from the one comprising persons with an anxiety, mood or personality disorder because of its clinical complexity, which generally requires intensive, multidisciplinary follow-up. Results: Among the new applicants, 48 % had a mental health disorder and, of these, 9 % reported a serious mental health disorder, that is, a psychotic or bipolar disorder. The results indicate that having an anxiety-, mood- or personality-type disorder is associated with a higher probability of reporting stressful interpersonal-type events, a more intense crisis, as well as a greater risk of auto-aggressive behaviours. Meanwhile, persons with a psychotic or bipolar disorder are more frequently provided with accommodations and more likely to receive intensive and support services, such as emergency interventions or the use of the Act respecting the protection of persons whose mental state presents a danger to themselves or others (P- 38). Conclusions: This descriptive portrait of the crisis centre clientele contributes to the reflection on differential intervention with persons in a crisis situation. It appears important to take an interest in the presence and type of mental health disorders of crisis centre callers, since these characteristics help to better foresee not only the nature and intensity of the crisis but also the type of services required. However, Quebec crisis centres have to respond to the needs of a heterogeneous clientele without having access to a typology and a theoretical model that consider this clinical diversity. Other studies should be conducted to validate, on the one hand, a crisis typology that would make it easier for caseworkers to collect data for evaluation purposes and, on the other hand, a differential intervention model...|$|R

This trend towards the rise of these services {{can not be understood}} without taking into account the transformations of employment policies and social welfare, and particularly the spreading of the activation doxa. Nowadays, IAG constitutes a professional field which is quite dynamic; new jobs of advisers/counsellors who support job seekers as well as workers in their career choices have been created. While these services are usually described for job seekers, this article sheds light on the similarities (as well as differences) of IAG services for the workforce, assuming that a common rationale underlies their uses. Two types of providers are studied and compared: the 'advisers of occupational mobility' of the Fongecif (a mutual fund for demand-led training) and counsellors form a private-for-profit providers specializing in job seeking. Together, they contribute to implement techniques of controlling people during their transitions on the labour market.

40|$|Over {{the recent}} past, Geographical Indication (GI) {{has emerged as}} one of the most {{contentious}} categories of intellectual property (IP). Two among the three TRIPS issues presently under discussion at the WTO pertain to GIs, the third being the relationship between the TRIPS and the CBD. Interestingly, in sharp contrast to the archetypical North-South divide on IP issues in the realm of the WTO and beyond, in the sphere of GIs one comes across developing countries joining hands with developed countries either as <b>demandeurs</b> or opponents in the ongoing WTO talks, depending on their respective stakes on GIs. The aim of this paper is to provide a concise account of the ongoing WTO discussions on GIs. However, the dynamics of the current negotiations cannot be put into perspective unless judged in the light of the key reasons underlying the discordance between the two sides of this highly contentious area, namely the ‘Old World’ and the ‘New World’. With this aim in view, the paper explores some of the key historical, legal and economic reasons underlying the GI row. Given that the issues presently under discussion have their origin in the Uruguay Round negotiations and the compromise deal on GIs that they culminated into, the paper undertakes a rigorous assessment of the drafting history of the Uruguay Round. It then goes on to track the ongoing negotiations and analyzes various negotiating proposals under consideration on the three GI issues: multilateral register for wines and spirits; extension of the higher level of protection presently available for wines and spirits to all product categories; and the ‘claw-back’ proposal of the European Communities (under the agriculture agenda). The paper argues that the recent emergence of a strategic alliance of more than 100 Member countries in support of a parallelism on the three IP issues may be helpful in pushing the GI agenda forward, including the case of ‘extension’ that has been strongly supported by many developing countries including China, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, among others. However, adequate legal protection at the international level through the ‘extension’ route can at best be regarded as necessary but in no way sufficient for reaping the commercial benefits out of the Southern GIs in the global market. Hence, the developing country proponents of GIs need to weigh the costs and benefits among various issues of interest to them before taking any particular stance at the WTO in the future. Given that the aforesaid strategic alliance was reached at the cost of a significant compromise on the part some of these developing countries on the TRIPS/CBD front, it remains an open question whether such a compromise was worth making for these countries, many of whom could actually have benefited more by getting a better deal on TRIPS/CBD than on GIs!geographical indication, intellectual property, WTO,...|$|R
