25|$|Compared to its {{personal}} computer contemporaries, {{the relatively high}} overall floating point performance of a Cell processor seemingly dwarfs the abilities of the SIMD unit in CPUs like the Pentium 4 and the Athlon 64. However, comparing only floating point abilities of a system is a one-dimensional and application-specific metric. Unlike a Cell processor, such desktop CPUs are more suited to the <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>software</b> usually run on {{personal computer}}s. In addition to executing multiple instructions per clock, processors from Intel and AMD feature branch predictors. The Cell is designed to compensate for this with compiler assistance, in which prepare-to-branch instructions are created. For double-precision floating point operations, as sometimes used in personal computers and often used in scientific computing, Cell performance drops by an order of magnitude, but still reaches 20.8GFLOPS (1.8GFLOPS per SPE, 6.4GFLOPS per PPE). The PowerXCell 8i variant, which was specifically designed for double-precision, reaches 102.4GFLOPS in double-precision calculations.|$|E

[...] Some tools claim to be able to detect 300+ unique problems. Both commercial and free tools exist in various languages. [...] These tools can be extremely useful when checking very large source trees, where it is impractical to do code walkthroughs. [...] A typical example of a problem detected would be a variable dereference that occurs before the variable is assigned a value. [...] As another example, some such tools perform strong type checking when the language does not require it. [...] Thus, they are better at locating likely errors, versus actual errors. [...] As a result, these tools have a reputation of false positives. [...] The old Unix lint program is an early example.|$|E
