40|$|Laminated veneer lumber (LVL) is a {{high-performance}} {{engineered wood product}} made of several wood veneers bound together mostly in grain direction. Veneers are obtained thanks to peeling process. This cutting process induces lathe checks of the veneer with variable depth and spatial frequencies. In this work, we studied the influence of lathe checks on the mechanical properties of LVL thanks to a finite element model of LVL beams made of checked veneers. The checks were modelled as free spaces in the cross-section. Several typical check depths and frequencies were compared, with the beam tested edgewise or flatwise. The {{results show that the}} longitudinal modulus of elasticity and the shear modulus in flatwise bending are marginally affected by checking, while the shear modulus of the LVL beam is significantly reduced in <b>edgewise</b> <b>bending</b> if the check depth is important.

50|$|An {{important}} goal of larger blade systems is to control blade weight. Since blade mass scales as the cube of the turbine radius, loading {{due to gravity}} constrains systems with larger blades. Gravitational loads include axial and tensile/ compressive loads (top/bottom of rotation) as well as bending (lateral positions). The magnitude of these loads fluctuates cyclically and the edgewise moments (see below) are reversed every 180° of rotation.Typical rotor speeds and design life are ~10rpm and 20 years, respectively, {{with the number of}} lifetime revolutions on the order of 10^8. Considering wind, it is expected that turbine blades go through ~10^9 loading cycles.Wind is another source of rotor blade loading. Lift causes bending in the flapwise direction (out of rotor plane) while air flow around the blade cause <b>edgewise</b> <b>bending</b> (in the rotor plane). Flapwise bending involves tension on the pressure (upwind) side and compression on the suction (downwind) side. <b>Edgewise</b> <b>bending</b> involves tension on the leading edge and compression on the trailing edge.|$|R

The test results indicated that regarding the <b>edgewise</b> <b>bending</b> force, the strongest middle joint was the double dowel joint made of beech wood (1896. 9 N), while the respective joint made of poplar marked quite a low value of bending force (937. 2 N). The strength of wooden corner blocks was proved to be quite powerful, made either of beech wood, poplar wood or the combination of the two wood species (beech: 1881. 8 N, poplar: 1237. 6 N, beech-poplar: 1783. 6 N).

40|$|When using timber for {{construction}} purposes {{it is important}} to know its strength. One way to do this is by sorting the boards into strength classes that are defined by European standards.  A commonly used method for strength grading is based on dynamic excitation in the longitudinal direction of the board to obtain an average dynamic longitudinal modulus of elasticity (MOE). This in turn correlates with the bending strength of the board in such a way that it can be used as an indicating property (IP) to bending strength. The use of MOE as an IP has proven to give the highest coefficient of determination (R 2) to both bending and tensile strength in boards. Through the research described in this thesis, one might find that both reducing the length of a board to half its initial length and by removing the part containing the lowest local MOE in <b>edgewise</b> <b>bending</b> provided similar results, the axial dynamic MOE remaining within a 1 % tolerance whereas the lowest IP based on local MOE in <b>edgewise</b> <b>bending</b> increased by 6 – 7 %...|$|R

Ultrasonically rated veneer, which was peeled from low value red maple saw-logs, was fabricated into 1 / 2 -in. - (1. 3 -cm-) and 2 -in. -(5 -cm-) thick LVL billets. The flexural properties of the billets and of corresponding small specimens cut from the billets were determined through flatwise and <b>edgewise</b> static <b>bending</b> tests.

40|$|Many modern {{wind turbine}} blades are {{constructed}} with a load-carrying box girder that supports the outer shell. The purpose of the box girder {{is to give the}} blade sufficient strength and stiffness, both globally and locally. Globally, the blade should be sufficiently stiff in order not to collide with the tower during operational loading. Locally, the box girder, together with the stiffness of the outer shell, ensures that the shape of the aerodynamic profile is maintained. The pressure and gravity load on the blade results in <b>edgewise</b> and flapwise <b>bending,</b> as well as torsional loading of the blade. The box girder primarily carries the flapwise and torsional loads, while the <b>edgewise</b> <b>bending</b> is carried mainly by strengthening the leading and trailing edges of the aerodynamic profile. In flapwise bending, one side of the box girder is in compression and one side in tension. The compressive loading may cause the flange to fail in buckling. It is well known that the boundary conditions have a large influence on the buckling strength of a panel. For the box girder, the transverse properties of the corner and web represent the boundary condition of the flange.

The properties of static bending were analyzed (strength and rigidity) in beams of the LVL, in the flatwise and edgewise positions. The properties of compression parallel to grain and shear parallel in the plans L-X and L-Y and density in this LVL panels were also analyzed according to ASTM-D 5456 / 4761 and ASTM-D 198 codes.

40|$|The {{trailing}} edge of {{wind turbine blades}} are commonly manufactured as an adhesive joint of the pressure-side and suction-side composite panels of the blade. Under some conditions, a lead-to-trailing (LTT) <b>edgewise</b> <b>bending</b> moment can induce buckling at the {{trailing edge}} adhesive joint, which may lead to early failure of the blade due to delamination. As a structural instability, buckling in wind turbines {{has been the focus}} of much research especially in full-scale tests and more recently at the sub-component level. These higher-level tests, however, are done on pre-manufactured wind turbine blades and require extensive preparation in order to adapt the testing rig to each blade section, as well as incurring into elevated costs. An additional test level has been suggested for elements and details of wind turbine blades. It has been suggested that this level can fulfill many purposes: New concepts, modifications, material combinations and orientations can be tested, partial safety factors of larger scale tests can be reduced or even certifying minor details of the blade can be done at the element and detail level. As such, the focus of this project is to develop a testing method for a simplified trailing edge bonded joint with a custom designed hinged clamping system upon which a compressive moment can be imposed to induce buckling. The design of this test will initially be based on a semi-analytical buckling plate model, where in-plane and out-of-plane displacements are coupled through the Von Karman strain-displacement relations. This semi-analytical tool is employed to quickly estimate the buckling loads for plates of varying dimensions. Strain-free imperfections can be included in the model for twisted/pre-bent plates in order to estimate their effect on reducing the load-bearing capacity of the structure. The semi-analytical tool is complemented with FE models for all the design parameters. The semi-analytical and numerical results are compared to demonstrate the agreement of both approaches aimed to provide a sturdy base for the research. Next, the experimental buckling loads and force-displacement curves are shown against the predictions from the previous approaches with good agreement. Nevertheless, the observable discrepancies between the experimental and numerical results showed that the desired joint-fixity at the boundaries was not fully realized, therefore leading to a slightly different post-buckling behavior. In the end, suggestions are given to improve on the experimental clamping system in order to improve and expand the scope of this research. FP 7 -ENERGY- 2013 IRPWIND Projec...|$|R
40|$|Climate change gives {{incentive}} for the transition to sustainable energy sources such as wind energy. To make wind energy cost competitive with fossil fuel sources, wind turbines are commonly placed in groups. As wind turbines extract energy from the wind, a wake occurs behind the turbine characterized by reduced a wind speed and increased turbulence. This wake causes downstream turbines to incur decreased power production and increased loading. Due to this aerodynamic interaction between these turbines, the total energy production is sub-optimal. A control strategy to mitigate these losses is by imposing yaw-misalignment with the incoming wind flow. This induces a lateral force which will cause the wake to deflect, with the goal to avoid downstream turbines. A side effect of wake deflection is partial wake overlap which {{has the potential to}} increase the fatigue loading of wind turbines. One way to decrease the cost of energy, is to increase the power production without significantly affecting the loads. Therefore, this thesis aims to quantify the load variations due to partial wake overlap and evaluate the benefits of a combined optimization of power and loads over traditional control strategies. For this purpose, we design a computational framework which computes the wind farm power production and the wind turbine rotor loads based on the yaw settings. To investigate the influence of partial wake overlap on the rotor fatigue, the differential flapwise and <b>edgewise</b> <b>bending</b> moments at hub height are computed. FLORIS is used to compute the power and CCBlade to determine the loads, supplemented with an algorithm to find the velocity distributions as hub height. The optimal yaw settings are found using an optimizer. The simulation results show that partial wake overlap can significantly increase asymmetric loading of the rotor and that yaw-misalignment is beneficial in situations where the wake can be sufficiently directed away from the downstream turbines. Furthermore, a combined optimization of power and loads in all wind directions has been found to increase the average power production by 1. 53 % and decrease the average differential flapwise and edgwise loads by respectively 42. 67 % and 45. 70 % compared to greedy control settings. Although results are promising, further improvements are required to confirm that mixed-objective optimization of power and loads is beneficial. We recommend the use of dynamic models to allow for more accurate load computations, validation of the results using high-fidelity models and investigating the influence of turbulence and Individual Pitch Control.

40|$|The {{wind turbine}} {{industry}} is rapidly growing, and wind turbines are growing in size accordingly. For the wind turbines {{in the past}} and up to the present commercial size, aerodynamic forces have basically governed all blade designs. However, as the turbines continue to grow in size, the gravity forces should therefore be carefully included in the design process for large wind turbine blades. In the present study, the aerodynamic and gravity forces together with their corresponding stress levels have been simulated for 3 different wind turbine sizes with diameter of 60 m, 90 m and 120 m. Two different upscaling models have been used for this simulation. A simple upscaling model uses analytical functions to obtain first estimates for the forces, bending moments and stresses. An advanced upscaling model couples a blade element momentum theory together with beam considerations. An aerodynamic analysis is performed in the advanced upscaling model within the framework that the structural analysis requires. Analytical functions are used in this analysis to describe the airfoils of the turbine blade. The aerodynamic performance is evaluated with respect to the annual energy production. For both models, a box spar of Glass Reinforced Plastics within the airfoil carries the loads. A sandwich material surrounds the airfoil. In addition, a trailing edge spline is inserted to ensure <b>edgewise</b> <b>bending</b> strength in the advanced upscaling model. Results from the simulations show that wind turbines between 60 m and 90 m in diameter are structurally designed to withstand the aerodynamic flapwise stresses. Simulations of the wind turbine with a diameter of 120 m show that the edgewise gravity stresses become more severe than the aerodynamic flapwise stresses for the inner aerodynamic sections. Hence, a design shift occurs for these inner sections. To reduce the edgewise stresses, a redesign of the blade geometry is therefore needed. Several redesign suggestions are implemented and discussed. Based on the simulation results and the redesign suggestions for wind turbine with a diameter of 120 m, scaling recommendations for the blade geometry are obtained. Scaling recommendations for both the blade planform, included chord and twist, and the blade airfoils presented. The airfoil parameters include relative thickness, position of maximum thickness, camber, positon of maximum camber and nose radius of the airfoil. In addition, the structural geometry within the airfoil, including spar geometry and spar material, are also subjected to scaling guidelines. The scaling recommendations presented in this study apply for wind turbines between 60 m and 120 m in diameter. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

40|$|Small-scale model {{tests in}} wave basins are {{important}} tools for validating numerical tools, evaluating system performance, and studying physical phenomena related to floating wind turbines. Hydrodynamic tests generally follow Froude scaling, but a consistent scaling {{of the wind}} turbine {{will result in a}} reduced Reynolds number compared to the prototype, which leads to generally poor aerodynamic performance. In order to solve such a Froude-Reynolds scaling conflict, a real-time hybrid model(ReaTHM) test was designed and carried out in SINTEF Ocean, illustrated in Figure(1). The aerodynamic loads were calculated numerically in real time based on the measured platform position. Then, the aerodynamic loads were applied to the physical model in the ocean basin through actuators. One disadvantage of the NOWITECH experiments in 2015 is that it used a rigid rotor model for the aerodynamic loads in order to minimize the calculation time. The purpose of this master s thesis project is to develop an efficient flexible structural model of the rotor, including the blade bending and torsion deflections, which is coupled to an aerodynamic code such as AeroDyn. First, a flexible blade model is developed. The blade is assumed to be an Euler-Bernoulli cantilever beam. The stretch, flapwise <b>bending,</b> <b>edgewise</b> <b>bending</b> and torsion deflections are considered. The blade kinetic energy and potential energy are established using a set of hybrid coordinates. The equations of motion are obtained by Hamilton s principle. Finite element analysis is applied to calculate the blade natural frequencies and eigenmodes. Modal analysis is carried out in the time domain, coupled with AeroDyn to simulate the aerodynamic loads. In the thesis, emulated ReaTHM testing is carried out, as shown in Figure(2). The tower, floater and mooring lines are modeled in SIMO-RIFLEX which can interact with the flexible blade model and the AeroDyn code through a dynamic link library(DLL). The computational efficiency of the presented flexible blade model is discussed. The set up of the emulated ReaTHM test is verified by decay tests and tests in irregular wind and wave. hen, the effects of blade flexibility in the ReaTHM test are investigated. ReaTHM testing with rigid blades is more conservative for the considered semi-submersible concept. The effects of blade flexibility on the mean values is limited(1 %). But the effects on the standard deviation(3 - 8 %), especially the standard deviation of tower fore-aft bending moment are large, leading to large fatigue damage. Since 2015 NOWITECH ReaTHM test used a rigid tower model, using flexible blades model will not lead to a significant difference. However, if SINTEF Ocean plans to do the ReaTHM test with tension leg platform(TLP), it is recommended to use the developed methodology to see if flexible blades should be used. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of limited actuations is carried out. In principle, all six components of simulated aerodynamic loads should be applied on the physical model. The sensitivity analysis shows that, for the semi-submersible in question, the aerodynamic heave force can be removed...|$|R

However, tidal sites are highly turbulent {{with a broad}} range of length scales and turbulence intensities that are site specific. In this work we describe an experimental campaign using static grids to generate turbulence and investigate its impact on a model tidal turbine in a circulating water flume. Length scales, energy spectra and turbulence dissipation rates are first considered for centre point measurements before full flow characterisation of the ambient conditions across the turbine rotor area. Six different cases were chosen to observe the performance of a 1 / 20 th scale 0. 8 m diameter turbine subjected to these flows. The rotor thrust and torque, and flapwise and <b>edgewise</b> blade root <b>bending</b> moments were measured. It was found that the thrust and power coefficients were sensitive to the estimate of ambient velocity. In the most extreme case the Betz limit could be ‘exceeded’ depending on which estimate of ambient velocity was used. Overall variations in the peak power coefficient of over 10 % were observed, demonstrating the significance turbulence has on turbine performance. It was also found that there is a strong correlation between fluctuations in blade root bending moments and the rotor loads. As a result we proposed that fatigue loads acting on the blades may be estimated from the fluctuations in power output of the turbine. Therefore maintenance operations maybe optimised from real-time fatigue monitoring of blade loads without the need to install additional instrumentation on the turbine blades. Under this proposed regime the cost of energy will be reduced due to reductions in turbine costs and following optimisation of the maintenance requirements and operational costs. This could also improve turbine reliability which would have significant implications for large multi turbine arrays...|$|R
