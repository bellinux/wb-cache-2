30|$|The study <b>of</b> {{economic}} <b>dispatch</b> <b>dates</b> {{back to the}} 1920 s. The {{spatial and}} temporal distribution variation of load demand is the prime cause <b>of</b> economic <b>dispatch.</b> The goal <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> is the advanced decision-making for base-point generations of units and configuration of spinning reserves based on load forecast. From classical economic dispatch centering on the concepts of incremental cost, incremental loss and hydro-coal conversion equivalent in the mid and late of 1950 s [1], to the optimal power flow considering network security in the 1960 s [2], thence to the theories <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> and control which emphasizing the coordination <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> and automatic generation control (AGC) in the 1980 s [3, 4], the study <b>of</b> economic <b>dispatch</b> has been relatively mature in theory and practice.|$|R

A breakthrough in this area occurred in 1956, when scientists discovered a way to significantly reduce the size of thermonuclear warheads.|$|E

40|$|A {{model has}} been {{developed}} and solved which captures {{the essence of the}} concept <b>of</b> mobile <b>dispatch</b> service. There are two types <b>of</b> users, <b>dispatch</b> and interconnect (calls routed from the public switched telephone network, of much longer holding times). Also, only some of the available repeaters can be used for interconnect traffic, and blocked interconnect calls are cleared. Dispatch calls, however, can access all repeaters, and then are queued if all repeaters are busy. One design decision involves a trade between blocking of interconnect calls and queueing <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> calls. A formula has been derived for both interconnect blocking probability and the mean dispatch queueing time to permit this trade. The results indicate that a good operating point is to have (N - a_d) (rounded down) interconnected repeaters, where there are N total repeaters and a_d Erlangs <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> traffic...|$|R
