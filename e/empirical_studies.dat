5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of scientific jury selection {{has also been}} comparison tested against other methods, such as attorney folklore and intuition. For trial attorneys, justifying the expense of SJS is contingent upon an improvement of their own jury selection abilities. Several <b>empirical</b> <b>studies</b> of traditional jury selection (by attorneys acting alone) have indicated that it and SJS are about equally effective.|$|E
5|$|Food webs exhibit {{principles}} of ecological emergence through {{the nature of}} trophic relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., omnivores) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., primary predators). Theoretical and <b>empirical</b> <b>studies</b> identify non-random emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time. Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions, and the weak interactions occur between these subgroups. This increases food web stability. Step by step lines or relations are drawn until a web of life is illustrated.|$|E

5|$|The seductive details {{effect has}} {{primarily}} been demonstrated {{at the point}} of knowledge acquisition (initial learning); its impact on transfer performance has not been clearly shown. Theory in text comprehension suggests that seductive details might be detrimental for recall but advantageous for transfer performance because of the schematic representation of information that trainees form during instruction. Researchers have described the seductive details effect as having a damaging effect on recall because it distracts trainees from learning and they tend to form inappropriate schemas to organize information. However, when learners are applying knowledge, <b>empirical</b> <b>studies</b> suggest that the distortion of the macro structure or schema of the instructional material is beneficial.|$|E

The focus of this section is recent statutory changes in the area, highlighting some key differences between the former and the current law. In Section II, the focus shifts to a review of the foundations for the <b>empirical</b> <b>study.</b> Section III more specifically addresses the main areas that are explored in the <b>empirical</b> <b>study,</b> including descriptions of case plans, parental compliance with case plans, and the mental status of parents. Section IV describes the <b>empirical</b> <b>study,</b> which addressed whether certain factors contribute to TPRs.
