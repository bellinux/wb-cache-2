40|$|The study {{concentrates}} {{on the effects of}} structural parameters of an electronic fuel injector on its dynamic response (the opening delay and the closing delay). The injector was developed for a marine medium-speed diesel engine. The dynamic response {{from the start of the}} control signal to the end of the needle valve closing were investigated. Firstly, a complete and detailed model of the electronic fuel injector was built and integrated into an optimisation model, where a MOGA was applied. Secondly, the importance and effects of main structural parameters on dynamic response were examined, as were their interactions. Finally, a Pareto optimum was obtained through scattering charts and comparisons were made between the baseline design and the optimal design. Results show that the control piston diameter, <b>fuel</b> oil <b>inlet</b> passage diameter, <b>fuel</b> oil outlet passage diameter and their interactions are influential factors to the opening delay, while the <b>fuel</b> oil <b>inlet</b> passage diameter has the dominant effect on the closing delay. A small control piston diameter together with a small <b>fuel</b> oil <b>inlet</b> passage diameter contribute to a short opening delay, however, they lead to a significant increase in the closing delay. Moreover, a small closing delay prefers a large <b>fuel</b> oil <b>inlet</b> passage diameter. The selected Pareto optimum achieved a significant reduction in both the opening delay and the closing delay under three different rail pressures...|$|R
2500|$|Float type carburetors {{are able}} to {{compensate}} for these unstable conditions through various design features, but only within reason.

The float is [...] lifted upward by inertia, closing the <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> valve as if the fuel bowl was full of fuel. Cutting off the fuel supply causes the fuel-air ratio to become greater than sixteen to one, which is then too lean for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|E
2500|$|By December 1909 Anzani had a [...] 3-cylinder {{air-cooled}} true {{radial engine}} running, {{developed from the}} earlier 3-cylinder fan configuration engines (semi-radials) that had powered Bleriot across the Channel.

[...] The engine therefore had {{a lot in common}} with the early 3-cylinder motors: cylinders were a single iron casting with built-in valve cells and ribs, and pistons were steel with cast-iron rings. [...] The early versions were side-valve engines with automatic (atmospheric pressure opened) inlet valves and exhaust valves mechanically operated via cams in the crankcase. [...] By the end of 1912, as with the smaller engines the exhaust valves were moved to the cylinder heads and operated by push-rods and rockers. [...] The exhaust valves were {{at the front of the}} engine, with the <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> manifold at the rear. [...] A prominent pair of 150° exhaust tubes were fitted.

50|$|Multiple {{crankshaft}} configurations do {{not necessarily}} need a cylinder head at all because they can instead have a piston {{at each end of}} the cylinder called an opposed piston design. Because <b>fuel</b> <b>inlets</b> and outlets are positioned at opposed ends of the cylinder, one can achieve uniflow scavenging, which, as in the four-stroke engine is efficient over a wide range of engine speeds. Thermal efficiency is improved because of a lack of cylinder heads. This design was used in the Junkers Jumo 205 diesel aircraft engine, using two crankshafts at either end of a single bank of cylinders, and most remarkably in the Napier Deltic diesel engines. These used three crankshafts to serve three banks of double-ended cylinders arranged in an equilateral triangle with the crankshafts at the corners. It was also used in single-bank locomotive engines, and is still used in marine propulsion engines and marine auxiliary generators.|$|R

40|$|According to {{the high}} {{operating}} temperature of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) (700 - 1100 ºC), {{it is known that}} some hydrocarbon fuels can be directly used as <b>inlet</b> <b>fuel</b> instead of hydrogen by feeding straight to the anode. This operation is called a direct internal reforming SOFC (DIR-SOFC). However, the major difficulty of this operation is the possible degradation of anode by the carbon deposition, as the carbon species are easily formed. In the present work, the effect of <b>inlet</b> <b>fuel</b> (i. e. H 2, synthesis gas (H 2 +CO), CH 4, CH 4 +H 2 O, CH 3 OH+H 2 O, and C 2 H 5 OH+H 2 O) on the degradation of nickel cermet (Ni/YSZ), which is the most common anode material of SOFC, was studied. It was found from the work that hydrogen and synthesis gas (CO+H 2) are proper to be used as direct <b>inlet</b> <b>fuels</b> for DIR-SOFC with Ni/YSZ anode, since the carbon formation on Ni/YSZ occurred in the small quantity. The mixture of methane and steam (CH 4 +H 2 O) can also be used as the inlet feed, but the H 2 O/CH 4 ratio plays an important role. In contrast, pure methane (CH 4), methanol with steam (CH 3 OH+H 2 O) and ethanol with steam (C 2 H 5 OH+H 2 O) are not suitable for using as direct <b>inlet</b> <b>fuel</b> for DIR-SOFC with Ni/YSZ anode even the higher H 2 O/CH 3 OH and H 2 O/C 2 H 5 OH ratios were applied...|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{investigations}} of Combustion Powered Actuation (COMPACT) have demonstrated its utility for high-speed aerodynamic flow control. In this actuation approach, momentary (pulsed) actuation jets {{are produced by}} the ignition of a mixture of gaseous fuel and oxidizer within a cubic-centimeter scale chamber. The combustion process yields a high pressure burst and the ejection of a high-speed exhaust jet. The present thesis focuses on characterization {{of the effects of}} the internal flow (which is altered through the <b>fuel</b> and oxidizer <b>inlet</b> streams) on mixing and flame propagation within the actuator's combustion chamber, and thereby on actuator operation and performance. A test chamber with a grid of interchangeable air and <b>fuel</b> <b>inlets</b> was used for parametric {{investigations of}} the effects of inlet size and location. Actuator performance is characterized using dynamic pressure measurements and phase-locked Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) of the combustor's internal flow field in the presence and absence of the active combustion process. Over the range tested, increased momentum of the air inlet jet for a given flow rate improves the actuator performance by increasing bulk velocities and small-scale motions within the chamber, thus yielding net higher flame propagation speed and subsequently faster pressure rise and higher pressure peak. Variation in inlet location that results in swirling flow within the chamber yields higher internal pressures while air flow over the spark ignition site yields lower internal pressures and erratic combustion. Improved refill and combustion processes will lead to enhanced performance combustor designs.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the potential benefits}} of hydrogen fuel injection in a three-dimensional scramjet inlet, flow through a Mach 12 rectangular-to-elliptical shape transitioning scramjet inlet was simulated with and without hydrogen fuel injection along its body-side compression surface. The observed flowfields showed that, at an equivalence ratio of 0. 33, the fuel cannot escape the body-side boundary layer, having little effect on macroscopic inlet flow structures. Interaction with the surrounding boundary-layer turbulence causes robust mixing of the <b>fuel</b> in the <b>inlet.</b> <b>Fuel</b> radicals are produced immediately following injection, particularly where the fuel plumes interact with thin, hot hypersonic boundary layers sweeping inward from the inlet side walls. Combustion does not proceed until the inlet compression process is nearly complete due to low static pressures in the inlet. Once the well-mixed fuel is processed by the final inlet compression shock, ignition and combustion occurs rapidly in the nearly constant cross-section region just upstream of the throat. The net drag increase observed was less than 5 %. This modest increase was primarily due to the fuel-injection process, with almost no additional drag due to fuel combustion.
