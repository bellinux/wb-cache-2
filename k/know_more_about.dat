5|$|The {{character}} of Brad Follmer {{was created in}} season nine to provide a love interest for Reyes, as the writers believed the audience needed to <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> her. However, Follmer's unresolved relationship with Reyes also served to heighten the conflict between Doggett and Follmer, as both men had feelings for her. Portraying actress Annabeth Gish was pleased {{that the relationship between}} her character and Scully was similar to that of two sisters, rather than Reyes serving as an antagonist to Scully.|$|E
5|$|During that period, the Batavia Society of Arts and Sciences, {{whose main}} {{interests}} were in archaeological research and conservation, {{became interested in}} the newly invented albumen print medium. The society felt that the world should <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> Javanese culture as expressed in the old inscriptions, statues, customs and temples. The Society arranged an archaeological tour around Java, headed by J.F.G. Brumund, a priest of the Batavian Evangelic Community and a specialist in Javanese. The Society also commissioned van Kinsbergen to accompany Brumund during his tour in order to illustrate Brumund's publication of Javanese culture and antiquities. The government granted permission for this tour, with the restriction that all wet-prints (cliches) would be government property and that extra printing would only be allowed with permission from the government.|$|E
5|$|We <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> Lancaster's {{character}} than {{of most of}} {{his contemporaries}} through his memoirs, the Livre de seyntz medicines (Book of the Holy Doctors). This book is a highly personal treatise on matters of religion and piety, but it also contains details of historical interest. It, among other things, revealed that Lancaster, {{at the age of}} 44 when he wrote the book in 1354, suffered from gout. The book is primarily a devotional work though; it is organised around seven wounds which Henry claims to have, representing the seven sins. Lancaster confesses to his sins, explains various real and mythical medical remedies in terms of their theological symbolism, and exhorts the reader to greater morality.|$|E

5|$|Ben Neal of the Tennessee Librarian {{questioned}} King's {{heavy use}} of Works Progress Administration-collected interview material, {{noting that the}} interviewees were too old to thoughtfully recall and express the complete spectrum of slave childhood. He then absolved King of fault for the otherwise dearth of data. Neal praised the book's accessibility for casual readers and academics alike. In The Journal of American Historys review of the first edition, Loren Schweninger commended King's restrained use of the WPA sources with Neal’s same rationale. Schweninger also sought more comparisons between Southern regions and in interracial relationships. Jane Turner Censer agreed that the book treated the South and century too broadly where it could have noticed specific differences due to migration patterns, regional changes, and time. Richard H. Steckel in The Georgia Historical Quarterly similarly desired comparison between slave and working class children of the era. Yet Roderick A. McDonald appreciated this broader perspective and emphasis on slave resilience and familial love in foil with two more negative and detailed, or narrower, studies (Them Dark Days by William Dusinberre and Life in Black and White by Brenda Stevenson) in his write-up for American Studies. Steckel added {{that he wanted to}} <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the children's nutrition, and Marten felt several of King's smaller points were not fully substantiated.|$|E

25|$|The {{study of}} the Hakka people first drew {{attention}} to Chinese and foreign scholars, missionaries, travellers and writers during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era {{in the middle of}} the nineteen century.

Ernest John Eitel, a prominent German missionary, was one of those who took a great interest in this area.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} of the optimistic bias is that people <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> themselves than they do about others. While individuals know how to think about themselves as a single person, they still think of others as a generalized group, which leads to biased estimates and inabilities to sufficiently understand their target or comparison group. Likewise, when making judgments and comparisons about their risk compared to others, people generally ignore the average person, but primarily focus on their own feelings and experiences.|$|E

It has the ability of a magnetic force; pulling the enemies towards it and get disintegrate by the latter.|$|E

25|$|Feena is {{the princess}} of the Kingdom of Sphere {{on the moon and}} also the main female protagonist. In order to become more {{knowledgeable}} about Earth and be able to follow in her mother's footsteps, she comes to Earth in a homestay with the family of the primary secretary {{to the president of the}} United Nations, Sayaka Hozumi. Since she was very young, she has always wanted to <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the Earth and some day she hopes to surpass her mother in trying to bridge the gap between the Earth and the Kingdom of Sphere. She is well educated in terms of literature and science and has great sword skills. However, she is somewhat naive in matters of the heart and has a tendency to jump into situations without thinking, (such as jumping into a river to save a drowning puppy, without knowing how to swim, and mistaking moths for aliens). Feena once came to Earth when she was a child, and met Tatsuya previously after her mother's death, in which Tatsuya tried to comfort her. She eventually falls in love with him and later marries him to finally bring peace between the Earth and the Moon.|$|E
