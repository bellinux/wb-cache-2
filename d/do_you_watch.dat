500|$|Biden {{declared}} his candidacy for president on January 31, 2007, {{although he had}} discussed running for months prior. It had been speculated that Biden would be offered and accept the position of Secretary of State because of his foreign policy experience and credentials. Biden rejected the notion outright, saying [...] "Under no administration will I accept the job of Secretary of State". He stated that he was focused only on the presidency. At a campaign event, Biden commented, [...] "I {{know a lot of}} my opponents out there say I'd be a great secretary of state. Seriously, every one of them. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> any of the debates? 'Joe's right, Joe's right, Joe's right.'" [...] Other candidates commenting that [...] "Joe is right" [...] in the Democratic debates has been converted into a Biden campaign theme and ad.|$|E
500|$|During his campaign, Biden {{focused on}} the war in Iraq and his support for the {{implementation}} of the Biden-Gelb plan to achieve political success. He touted his record in the Senate as the head of major congressional committees and his experience on foreign policy. Despite speculation to the contrary, Biden rejected the notion of accepting the position of Secretary of State, focusing only on the presidency.

[...] Other candidates' comments that [...] "Joe is right" [...] in the Democratic debates were converted into a Biden campaign theme and ad. In mid-2007, Biden stressed his foreign policy expertise compared to Obama's, saying of the latter, [...] "I think he can be ready, but right now I don't believe he is. The presidency is not something that lends itself to on-the-job training." [...] Biden also said that Obama was copying some of his foreign policy ideas. Biden was noted for his one-liners on the campaign trail, saying of Republican then-frontrunner Rudy Giuliani at the debate on October 30, 2007, in Philadelphia, [...] "There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11." [...] Overall, Biden's debate performances were an effective mixture of humor, and sharp and surprisingly disciplined comments.|$|E

40|$|Mass {{media is}} crucial in forming and {{reflecting}} opinion in society. Newspaper, television, and the internet all {{play a critical role}} in the daily lives of Americans; disseminating information that shapes views of life, culture, and politics. It seems like all forms of media communication, either subliminally or blatantly, reflect the political climate of the day. The news media flood American homes with images, audio, and commentary on political happenings. My questions are as follows: How much basic political knowledge does an average college student possess? Where does the average college student receive his or her political knowledge? Does celebrity endorsement of a political ideology influence college students? If so, then to what extent? My goal is to survey approximately 400 random URI undergraduate students. The survey will ask questions relating to three areas. The first is a political knowledge index- basic information about politics. I want to have a general idea of the student’s depth of basic political fact, i. e., name the Vice President of the United States, how many Senators represent Rhode Island? The second will explore where the student gets political information, i. e., how often <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> network news broadcasts? If so, which ones?” The third section will explore celebrity-endorsed politics. I will write statements said by celebrities or included in musical lyrics. I will then ask whether the student agrees with the statement, to what extent. I will also ask if the student regularly listens to the artist or watches the celebrity’s television programs. In order to better understand their own ideologies, I will also include a brief section on their political behaviors: Did they vote in the last election? If so, for whom did they vote? Do they affiliate with a political party? The results of the survey will be discussed and compared to past research done in this field...|$|E
