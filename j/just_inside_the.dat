However, the point where the Red River crossed this line was not marked until 1823, when Stephen Long conducted a survey expedition.

5|$|The λ {{ring was}} one of two rings {{discovered}} by Voyager 2 in 1986. It is a narrow, faint ring located <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> ε ring, between it and the shepherd moon Cordelia. This moon clears a dark lane <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> λ ring. When viewed in back-scattered light, the λ ring is extremely narrow—about 1–2km—and has the equivalent optical depth 0.1–0.2km at the wavelength 2.2μm. The normal optical depth is 0.1–0.2. The optical depth of the λ ring shows strong wavelength dependence, which is atypical for the Uranian ring system. The equivalent depth is as high as 0.36km in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, which explains why λ ring was initially detected only in UV stellar occultations by Voyager 2. The detection during a stellar occultation at the wavelength 2.2μm was only announced in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Being located <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> Lions' Gate, one of {{the major}} entries to the Old City, the East Jerusalem Development Company {{initially}} intended to excavate the reservoir and build a multi-storey car park at the site. This post-1967 plan was rejected by the waqf authorities who own the plot because they feared that clearance work {{at the base of the}} Temple Mount would endanger the Haram compound. Subsequently, in 1981 a small square equipped with benches was constructed on part of the covered pool.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, when M-40 was extended, M-89 was rerouted out of Allegan to the {{southeast}} along its present-day alignment to terminate at US131 in Plainwell. Just a few years later, the road was extended further to {{the southeast}} to Richland then east along its present-day routing to end at M-96 in Augusta. In 1931, the route was realigned to run east, rather than south into Augusta, where it then met up with M-96 <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> Calhoun County line. The road remained in this fashion for the next 20 years.|$|E

Soon afterwards, NY321 turns to the northeast, heading towards NY5. The highway intersects Forward Road (unsigned NY931F) <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> Camillus town line soon after the turn. Forward Road, a local road that passes through a mixture of open fields and forests, serves as a connector between NY321 and NY174.|$|E
5|$|In May 1861, Isham G. Harris, the {{governor}} of Tennessee, appointed the state's attorney, Daniel S. Donelson, as a brigadier general and directed him to build fortifications on the rivers of Middle Tennessee. Donelson found suitable sites, but they were within the borders of Kentucky, still a neutral state at that time. Moving upriver, <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> Tennessee border, Donelson selected {{the site of the}} fort on the Cumberland River that would bear his name. Colonel Bushrod Johnson of the Tennessee Corps of Engineers approved of the site.|$|E
5|$|Islamic {{reverence for}} the site {{is derived from the}} belief that the prophet Mohammed tied his miraculous steed Buraq nearby during his night journey to Jerusalem.

5|$|Launched in 1983, {{the space}} {{telescope}} IRAS detected infrared emissions from stars near to the Sun, including an excess infrared emission from Epsilon Eridani. The observations indicated a disk of fine-grained cosmic dust was orbiting the star; this debris disk has since been extensively studied. Evidence for a planetary system was discovered in 1998 by the observation of asymmetries in this dust ring. The clumping in the dust distribution {{could be explained by}} gravitational interactions with a planet orbiting <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> dust ring.|$|E
5|$|Past Rye Lake Road, NY120A {{serves the}} Griffith E. Harris Golf Club and several mansions {{on its way}} back to the New York–Connecticut state line. Just north of the airport, NY120A turns westward onto Gateway Lane, a small east–west street leading back into New York and the town of North Castle. Gateway Lane and NY120A both end <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> state line at an {{intersection}} with NY120. Here, NY120 changes names from Purchase Street to King Street as the route continues NY120A's course along the state line.|$|E

5|$|A banqueting {{house was}} built <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> {{south-west}} corner of the moat. Though it was probably built in the 16th century, {{it was in a}} dilapidated state by 1577. A base court (an enclosed area) was added in front of the castle’s gatehouse after the main complex was built, but it unclear when. Wetland areas south and east of the castle may have been used to emulate a mere, a type of broad shallow lake. As well as this, there were two fishponds, but their dating is uncertain. During Wressle Castle’s heyday in the 16th century, the quality of the gardens and ornamental landscape would have paralleled the interior of the renovated buildings, possibly even rivalling gardens at royal properties.|$|E
5|$|In February–March 2007 New Horizons {{spacecraft}} {{conducted a}} deep {{search for new}} small moons inside the main ring. While no satellites larger than 0.5km were found, the cameras of the spacecraft detected seven small clumps of ring particles. They orbit <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> orbit of Adrastea inside a dense ringlet. The conclusion, that they are clumps and not small moons, is based on their azimuthally extended appearance. They subtend 0.1–0.3° along the ring, which correspond to 1000–3000km. The clumps are {{divided into two groups}} of five and two members, respectively. The nature of the clumps is not clear, but their orbits are close to 115:116 and 114:115 resonances with Metis. They may be wavelike structures excited by this interaction.|$|E

5|$|Just {{across the}} county line, I-87 intersects NY9N again at exit34, the southernmost {{junction}} to feature bilingual guide signs in English and French {{due to the}} road's proximity to Quebec. Past NY9N, the Northway curves to the north, running along {{the west side of}} Keeseville before entering another rural but fairly level stretch that follows I-87 out of Adirondack Park. Now outside the park, the highway encounters more frequent pockets of development as it follows NY22 into the town of Plattsburgh. <b>Just</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> town line, the Northway crosses over the Salmon River and intersects NY22 at exit36, a junction serving nearby Plattsburgh International Airport. While NY22 heads northeast into the city of Plattsburgh, I-87 runs north through its western suburbs, passing over the Saranac River and intersecting NY3 at exit37. The Northway and NY22 meet again north of downtown at exit38.|$|E

Here, the route enters a junction with the western terminus of NY172 (South Bedford Road) at the main entrance to Northern Westchester Hospital. The commercial surroundings continue north for another eight blocks to Jeff Feigel Square, where NY117 connects to the east end of NY133. Main Street turns northwest onto NY133 while NY117 splits to the northeast along Bedford Road.|$|E
5|$|Males within Palaeognathae (with the {{exception}} of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with {{the exception}} of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.|$|E
