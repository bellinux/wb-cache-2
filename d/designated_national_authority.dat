40|$|Given {{the lack}} of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) {{activities}} in least developed countries (LDCs), subsidies for CDM projects have been suggested as a remedy. To date, subsidies spent in the CDM context have been limited to capacity building. Donor agencies have provided close to EUR 45 million for awareness raising, institutional capacity building and project development in Africa and LDCs over the last 10 years, which equals about 8 % of the total CDM revenues in these countries. Per registered project, the implicit subsidy reaches almost EUR 1 million. This article assesses these CDM subsidies {{with regard to their}} effectiveness in mobilizing institutional set-up and project development. Targeted capacity building programmes, such as those focused on establishing a <b>Designated</b> <b>National</b> <b>Authority,</b> have been successful, but project development support did not mobilize significant numbers of CDM projects in most LDCs.

40|$|As the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) {{has shown}} its rapidly growing market and we {{approach}} {{the beginning of the}} first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, an increasing number of non-Annex-B countries have recently established their <b>Designated</b> <b>National</b> <b>Authorities</b> (DNAs) to participate in the CDM. Essential questions to enable efficient operation of a non-Annex-B DNA (host country DNA) are i) how to expedite an approval process without losing quality of approved projects, ii) how to attract foreign investors, and iii) how to become financially sustainable. It is concluded that a balance between the level of scrutiny and approval speed and criteria is essential for the first question. A standardized and transparent approval process is of great help. As for the second question, a quick and transparent approval process {{is one of the key}} factors to attract foreign investors. A careful choice of promotional functions should be made striking a balance between a host country's needs and resource availability. A host country DNA at an early stage of development should first focus on operationalization of its approval system and is not recommended to expand its scope to promotional activities.

40|$|The clean {{development}} mechanism (CDM) {{is part of}} {{the global}} carbon market developing rapidly in response to global warming. It has the twin objective to achieve sustainable development (SD) in host countries and assist Annex- 1 countries in achieving their emission reduction targets in a cost-efficient manner. However, research has shown that trade-offs between the two objectives exist in favour of cost-efficient emission reductions and that left to the market forces, the CDM does not significantly contribute to sustainable development. The main argument of the paper is the need for an international standard for sustainability assessment [...] additional to national definitions [...] to counter weaknesses in the existing system of sustainability approval by <b>designated</b> <b>national</b> <b>authorities</b> in host countries. The article develops a new methodology, i. e. a taxonomy for sustainability assessment based on text analysis of the 744 project design documents (PDDs) submitted for validation by 3 May 2006.

40|$|Policy {{documents}} and academic literature suggest that Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) finance could complement traditional ‘energy access’ (EA) funding in developing countries, including the Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Yet these propositions {{have not been}} empirically tested. This study helps fill this gap by examining constraints to CDM project passage through five stages of an idealized project development cycle (PDC) in Tanzania, and their implications for {{the ability of the}} CDM to contribute to financing energy access in LDCs. Twenty-five semi-structured interviews and documentary material were analysed using an analytical framework developed for systematic investigation of constraints. Institutional constraints such as the under-performance of Tanzania's <b>Designated</b> <b>National</b> <b>Authority</b> were the most often mentioned obstacles for project development. Yet non-institutional constraints such as limited energy sector mitigation potential, indigenous skill shortages, and low carbon market prices also hinder project development. Institutional constraints buttress, rather than supersede, pre-existing non-institutional constraints, and together they prevent energy projects from completing the PDC and accessing CDM finance. The number and severity of constraints suggest that the situation is unlikely to change rapidly, and that the CDM sustains and exacerbates existing global inequalities. Since traditional energy access funding is insufficient to address these inequalities, new funding and policy mechanisms are required...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol, industrialised {{countries}} may finance greenhouse gases mitigation projects in developing countries. The Kyoto Pro-tocol explicitly {{requires that the}} CDM shall assist developing countries to achieve sustainable devel-opment. However, a clear definition of sustainability for CDM projects is still debatable. MATA-CDM (Multi-Attributive Assessment of CDM Projects) is an approach that facilitates a quantitative assessment of potential projects regarding their contribution to sustainable development. This paper presents applications of MATA-CDM in two different countries. In South Africa, the application was done mainly for academic and demonstrative purposes, whereas in Uruguay it was implemented together with the responsible <b>Designated</b> <b>National</b> <b>Authority</b> (DNA). The work in both countries included the selection of sustainability criteria and measurable indicators. Experts weighted the criteria using personal interviews and a multi-stakeholder workshop. This method was applied to three potential CDM projects in South Africa and one in Uruguay. Results show that under the conditions of this study, the MATA-CDM approach yet fails to yield a perfect quantitative overall sustainability assessment of CDM projects but that several findings could be useful to further develop the approach with the aim to translate the vague term sustainable development to a mainstream project level. Valuable experience was in particular collected with different stakeholder processes to perform criteria weighting...|$|E

But also Annex I DNA websites can play a useful role, particularly for host country companies who want to assess the attractiveness of countries as buyers of CERs. As per the information available on the internet, only 26 Parties among which are 8 Annex I countries have set up official DNA websites which contain a variety of information related to CDM as well as climate change-related activities. As it has been observed that the organisation of most of the DNA websites and quality of information available can be improved and webmarketing tools seem not to have been used, we suggest a standard model structure of websites separately for DNAs of Non-Annex I and Annex I countries differentiated according to the size and CDM attractiveness of the host country...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: As the 2012 end of {{the first}} {{commitment}} period of the Kyoto Protocol is fast approaching, there is a strong realisation that the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects have no doubt been playing an important role globally, particularly in promoting clean development in China. Consequently, the prospects for the CDM market in the post-Kyoto era are attracting a lot of attention, including from the developing countries. Based on a review of international and domestic sources, the paper analyses the progress in the development of CDM projects both globally and China. As at 2011, China has attracted the lion share of CDM investment with 45 % of the world projects located in this country and they account for 63 % of the global annual certified emission reductions under this mechanism. Due to the relative easiness of implementation, the main area of investment is new and renewable energy (representing 73 % of China’s registered CDM projects). China’s fast economic development, open door investment policy, political stability, high educational and technological standards and reliable infrastructure are all encouraging the interest of foreign investors seeking to reduce their domestic carbon footprint. In order to facilitate the location of CDM projects, the Chinese government formulated a series of policies and regulations as well as establishing national coordinating groups for climate change, CDM <b>Designated</b> <b>National</b> <b>Authorities</b> and projects auditing boards, which are responsible for projects application, auditing and management.

Compliance with all legal requirements is a basic consideration for project approval. The DNA invites other agencies with powers over sector-specific areas to join the DNA’s Advisory Board. Prior to project approval, CDM project submissions are required to be sent to the respective provinces where the project is to be executed for a 10 day comment period. CDM is not expected to be a major driver behind afforestation and reforestation projects. Financial costs of CDM AR are seen as a serious barrier to many potential project proponents, particularly for small-scale initiatives. Major multinational forestry companies have not shown a major interest in the carbon market, focusing their investment either on timber or pulp. However, there is considerable interest in certain provinces in the potential for CDM to leverage projects with additional environmental benefits, such as the prevention of erosion or watershed protection.

In addition, most of the studies and discussions on the DNA structures in Latin America and Caribbean and Indonesia have revealed the DNAs? inability to be financially supported by the developing host countries However, the Marrakech Accords did not specify that the DNA must not be created at national level.

40|$|Purpose - Sustainable {{development}} (SD) {{in developing}} countries is mentioned {{as one of the}} main aims of the Kyoto protocol's clean development mechanism. However, in the present context, uncertainty prevails to whether the (CDM) is actually procuring its aims in terms of achieving SD and to what extent. Chile, which has an open market economy, could risk becoming "locked" into a carbon intensive future, due to the recently discovered coal reserves and plans of large utilities to move to coal technology and not necessarily clean-coal technology. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assist Chile in finding ways of encouraging technology transfer of energy technologies that would contribute to a low-carbon sustainable energy development. Design/methodology/approach - In order to be able to identify potential CDM projects facilitating SD {{in developing countries}}, through technology transfer from developed ones and, thus, to formulate a series of possible investment strategies with a SD component, it is crucial to establish a clear understanding of the host country's needs and priorities and the suitable energy technologies to meet these needs. Findings - This paper presents results obtained from an elaborated stakeholders' assessment on Chile's high priority energy needs, sustainable energy technologies fulfilling these needs and opportunities and barriers related with the implementation of these technologies in the particular market. Originality/value - The paper provides useful results that could facilitate Chile's <b>designated</b> <b>national</b> <b>authority</b> as well as future project investors to put on the map the most suitable sustainable energy technologies, based on the country's SD needs and priorities, to transfer and implement via CDM.

40|$|The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) was {{originally}} {{seen as an}} instrument with a bilateral character where an entity from an industrialised country invests in a project in a developing country (DC). Also, multilateral funds were envisaged that would bundle investments to spread project risks. The sluggish implementation of incentives for industrialised country companies to embark on CDM projects and low carbon prices led to a preference of just buying Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) instead of investing in projects. Thus a third option has gained prominence - the unilateral option where the project development is planned and financed within the DC. We propose that a project should be called "pure unilateral" if it involves no foreign direct investment (FDI), only has {{the approval of the}} <b>Designated</b> <b>National</b> <b>Authority</b> (DNA) of the host country and sells its CERs after certification directly to an industrialised country. Unilateral projects can become attractive if the host country risk premium for foreign investors is high despite a high human, institutional and infrastructure capacity and domestic capital availability. Moreover, transaction costs can be reduced compared to foreign investments that have to overcome bureaucratic hurdles. On the other hand, technology transfer is likely to be lower, capacity building has to be done by the host country and all risks have to be carried by host country entities. The potential to carry out unilateral CDM projects strongly varies among DCs. Whereas several countries from Asia and Latin America might well be able to design projects autonomously, most of the Sub-Saharan countries rely on foreign support. International donors of capacity building grants should increasingly address those DCs that are not in the focus of foreign investors and support them in the design of projects.

Mitigation actions in developing countries need to be prioritized based on least cost actions that maximize developmental benefits. MRV of mitigation co-benefits is important in this regard. This case study considers how to include the MRV of non-GHG impacts of mitigation into the domestic climate change Measurement and Evaluation (M&E) system currently being developed in South Africa. It considers the rationale behind MRV of non-GHG impacts, assesses options for measuring non-GHG impacts and proposes a potential framework for the development of such an approach specifically within the South Africa context. A framework is developed based on a literature review, an assessment of South Africa’s developmental goals and inputs obtained from key stakeholders. Stakeholders interviewed included representatives from national government departments, the private sector, civil society and the South African <b>Designated</b> <b>National</b> <b>Authority.</b> The conceptual approach and preliminary results were presented to the climate change M&E Technical Working Group (a collection of representatives from national government departments, government research institutions, academia, business and NGOs responsible for developing the M&E system in South Africa) for their inputs. The key drivers for measuring non-GHG impacts of mitigation were found to be the alignment of {{mitigation actions}} with national developmental objectives, meeting international requirements under the UNFCCC (or an alternative framework) and requirements or preferences of buyers of carbon credits and funders of mitigation actions. There are two distinct opportunities for MRV of non-GHG impacts in the context of these drivers: MRV in the planning and prioritizing of mitigation actions (projections and benchmarks); and MRV of the impacts that measure effectiveness in achieving objectives and inform future decision-making. Critically, significant resources are required to MRV non-GHG impacts of mitigation.

Furthermore, Regulation (EC) No 689 / 2008 of the European Parliament and the Council of 17 June 2008 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals is the latest in a series of measures over the years that seek to address international trade with dangerous chemicals. This Regulation reaffirms the EU commitment towards ensuring proper control in the trade and use of dangerous chemicals at the global level, based on the principle that it should help to protect human health and the environment beyond its borders as well as within. Two linked processes were identified as characterising the PIC content management activities. They are analysed separately: the export notifications process and the explicit consents process. The export notifications process aims to identify uniquely the single administrative document clearing customs. The explicit consents process aims to explicitly exchange risk management information, between an exporting <b>designated</b> <b>national</b> <b>authority</b> and an importing one, prior to export of chemicals. Each process is first described. The functionalities supporting the process are listed and explained. The specific implication of the administrator in the process is then identified. Finally the liaison between both processes is analysed. Several working documents are annexed in order to transparently manage the hand over of the PIC content management activities to the European Chemicals Agency - ECHA. JRC.

40|$|The twin {{objectives}} of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) are to assist developing country host nations in achieving sustainable development, and to assist developed countries in meeting their greenhouse gases (GHG) emission reduction targets. This is achieved through implementing GHG abatement projects in developing countries. There has been increased attention in the contribution of CDM projects to sustainable development in host nations. Previous research has suggested that, when left to market forces, the CDM does not contribute effectively to sustainable development. One likely reason is that host nations define and evaluate projects contribution to sustainable development. This {{has led to a}} “race to bottom” with regard to setting sustainability standards triggered by a concern that project developers prioritise CDM investments in countries with lower sustainability standards. Researchers have identified the need for an international standard for assessing sustainable development benefits of CDM projects. The main aim of this research was to develop an international level framework for assessing sustainable development benefits of CDM projects with a specific focus on landfill gas (LFG) projects. An in-depth literature review was carried out to establish the link between sustainable development benefits of CDM projects in general, and LFG CDM projects in particular. A case study methodology was used to develop an understanding of landfill management practices at three existing landfill sites both in developed (n= 1) and developing countries (n= 2). The results from the literature review and case studies were utilized to develop the framework for assessing sustainable development benefits of LFG CDM projects. The developed framework comprises three sustainable development dimensions and 12 criteria with 16 matching indicators. Such a project specific assessment framework has not previously been developed. The results from the validation of the framework suggested that technology transfer is the most likely benefit of any LFG CDM project while balance of payments is the least likely benefit. The proposed framework can be utilised at two stages in a CDM project lifecycle. It can be used as: (i) a template to guide host nations’ <b>Designated</b> <b>National</b> <b>Authorities</b> (DNAs) on how to review projects before issuing Letters of Approval (LoA); and (ii) Designated Operating Entities (DOEs) can also use the developed framework to validate and verify that sustainable development benefits stated in project proposals have been realised at the project level...|$|R
30|$|The Fund {{recognises}} {{the need}} to ensure that developing country partners exercise ownership of climate change funding and integrate it within their own national action plans. The Governing Instrument of the Fund makes clear that it will adopt a country-driven approach and strengthen program coherence and stakeholder coordination at the national level. To support this in every developing country there are <b>National</b> <b>Designated</b> <b>Authorities</b> (NDAs) who are the interface between each country and the Fund. These focal points communicate the Country’s strategic priorities for financing low-emission and climate-resilient development across its economy. Over 130 countries have selected NDAs to play this role. They are chosen by Governments to act as the core interface between a developing country and the Fund. The NDAs provide broad strategic oversight of GCF’s activities in a country and serve as the point of communication with the Fund.|$|R
