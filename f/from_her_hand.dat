5|$|The video {{starts with}} {{different}} {{views from the}} city, then shifts to a store where Drake is speaking to the cashier. Rihanna enters, grabbing his attention. She smiles at him and walks towards a fridge and grabs a milk package. Drake follows her and his verse begins. He holds her hand as he raps his verse, the milk package falls <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> as she holds his, thus spilling milk on the floor. When Drake's verse is over, Rihanna pushes him and walks away with a smile.|$|E
25|$|The bandit's {{most famous}} exploit {{occurred}} {{early in his}} career in 1944—the robbery of the Duchess of Pratameno. He and his men sneaked into her estate unnoticed, and Giuliano was in her salon before she knew what was occurring. He kissed her hand and showed respect for her noble status, but then demanded all of her jewelry. When she refused, Giuliano threatened to kidnap her children. After she handed the loot over, he took a diamond ring <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> which he wore {{for the rest of his}} life, and borrowed John Steinbeck's “In Dubious Battle” from her library before leaving (which was returned with a respectful note a week later). By mid-1945, Giuliano's daring, good looks, and theatrical flair were the talk of Sicily, and soon beyond.|$|E
25|$|It {{seems obvious}} that Gerda is the murderer. Henrietta steps forward {{to take the}} {{revolver}} <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> but apparently fumbles and drops it into the swimming pool, destroying the evidence. However, the pistol that Gerda was holding was not the gun used to kill John. None of the witnesses has seen Gerda shoot John. It seems difficult to build a case against {{any of the other}} potential suspects. Lucy was the next suspect, as she kept a pistol concealed in her basket of eggs. However, the pistol was the wrong calibre. Henrietta is the next suspect, having left an unusual doodle in the pavilion around the time John was killed. When the murder weapon turns up in Poirot's hedge, it has fingerprints that match none of the suspects.|$|E

500|$|Sam begs Ruby {{to teach}} him how to use his abilities, but she tells him that it is too late. Dean accepts his fate as the clock strikes midnight, but runs from the {{approaching}} hellhound. The three barricade themselves inside a room, but Dean quickly realizes that Lilith has taken over Ruby's host. Claiming to have sent Ruby [...] "far, far away", Lilith telekinetically pins the brothers down and lets in the hellhound. As Dean is mauled to death, Lilith blasts Sam with white energy <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> Horrified to see that it has no effect, she flees her host before Sam can retaliate. A devastated Sam cradles Dean, whose soul is then shown in Hell hanging from a vast landscape of chains and meathooks while fruitlessly screaming for Sam.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of [...] "Loverboy", Carey {{embarked}} on a short promotional campaign for the song. On July19,2001, Carey made a surprise appearance on the MTV program Total Request Live (TRL). As the show's host Carson Daly began taping following a commercial break, Carey came out onto the filming stage, pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large men's shirt. Seemingly anxious and exhilarated, Carey began giving out individual bars of ice cream to fans and guests on the program, while waving to the crowd down below on Times Square, while diverging into a rambling monologue regarding therapy. Carey then walked to Daly's platform and began a striptease, in which she shed her shirt to reveal a tight yellow and green ensemble, leading him to exclaim [...] "Mariah Carey has lost her mind!". While she later revealed that Daly was aware of her presence in the building prior to her appearance, she admitted that he was meant to act surprised {{in order to provide}} a more dramatic effect for the program. Carey's appearance on TRL garnered strong media attention, with many critics and newspapers citing her behavior as [...] "troubled" [...] and [...] "erratic". In the days following her appearance on TRL, Carey had begun displaying [...] "erratic behavior" [...] during a public record signing for the single at Tower Records in New York. As the appearance was filmed, she began rambling on several points, leading her to discuss radio-host Howard Stern, and how his form of humor on his program bothered her greatly. At that point, Carey's publicist Cindi Berger grabbed the microphone <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> and ordered the cameras to stop filming. Only days later, Carey began posting irregular voice notes and messages on her official website: ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We know Real World is not {{the real}} world. I {{recently}} met a woman named Irene McGee who quit this show and said not even the house was real. The fridges were all filled {{to the brim with}} Vlasic pickles delivered daily by the crate load along with gallons of Nantucket Nectar. If she drank anything else, the crew took it <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and made sure the Nantucket Nectar label was facing the camera instead. When she walked out, another guy in the cast of Real World hit her and the camera guy did nothing ... When she spoke out, MTV sued her. And Entertainment Weekly rated Irene getting smash mouthed the 47th most interesting event on TV that whole year ... Can't you MTV think of a better way to raise audience awareness of domestic violence than to make it look cool?" ...|$|E

2500|$|On one occasion, as Stephen was mopping {{the kitchen}} floor with a cloth, Rose accidentally stepped into the bowl of water he had been using to perform this task. In response, Rose smashed the boy {{over the head with}} the bowl, then {{repeatedly}} kicked him in the head and chest as she shouted: [...] "You did that on purpose, you little swine!" [...] On another occasion, Rose became hysterical at a missing kitchen utensil, then grabbed a knife she had been using to cut a slab of meat, repeatedly inflicting light scour marks to Mae's chest until her rib cage was covered with light knife wounds. All the while, Mae had screamed, [...] "No, Mum! No, Mum!" [...] as Stephen and Heather stood by, helplessly sobbing. Even Fred occasionally became the recipient of Rose's violence. On one occasion in the late 1970s, Rose chased after Fred with a carving knife in her hand, although Fred was able to slam shut the door of the room into which he had run as Rose plunged at him with the knife, resulting in the knife embedding itself in the door, and Rose's fingers sliding down the blade, almost severing them <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> In response, Rose calmly wrapped her hand in a towel and said: [...] "Look what you done, fella. You've got {{to take me to the}} hospital now." ...|$|E
