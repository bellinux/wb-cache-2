5|$|Practically, several {{immunodiagnostic}} methods {{based on}} detection of complex antigen-antibody {{are used to}} diagnose infectious diseases, for example ELISA, <b>immunofluorescence,</b> Western blot, immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, and magnetic immunoassay. Antibodies raised against human chorionic gonadotropin are used in over the counter pregnancy tests.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} {{doubt about the}} cause of the skin lesions, a biopsy of the skin may be {{performed}} to distinguish the purpura from other diseases that cause it, such as vasculitis due to cryoglobulinemia; on microscopy the appearances are of a hypersensitivity vasculitis, and <b>immunofluorescence</b> demonstrates IgA and C3 (a protein of the complement system) in the blood vessel wall. However, overall serum complement levels are normal.|$|E
5|$|Other {{methods for}} elucidating the {{cellular}} location of proteins requires {{the use of}} known compartmental markers for regions such as the ER, the Golgi, lysosomes or vacuoles, mitochondria, chloroplasts, plasma membrane, etc. With the use of fluorescently tagged versions of these markers or of antibodies to known markers, it becomes much simpler to identify the localization of a protein of interest. For example, indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> will allow for fluorescence colocalization and demonstration of location. Fluorescent dyes are used to label cellular compartments for a similar purpose.|$|E
5|$|The exosome {{complex is}} the target of autoantibodies in {{patients}} suffering from various autoimmune diseases. These autoantibodies are mainly found in people that suffer from the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, an autoimmune disease in which patients have symptoms from both scleroderma and either polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Autoantibodies can be detected in the serum of patients {{by a variety of}} assays. In the past, the most commonly used methods were double immunodiffusion using calf thymus extracts, <b>immunofluorescence</b> on HEp-2 cells or immunoprecipitation from human cell extracts. In immunoprecipitation assays with sera from anti-exosome positive sera, a distinctive set of proteins is precipitated. Already years before the exosome complex was identified, this pattern was termed the PM/Scl complex. <b>Immunofluorescence</b> using sera from these patients usually shows a typical staining of the nucleolus of cells, which sparked the suggestion that the antigen recognized by autoantibodies might be important in ribosome synthesis. More recently, recombinant exosome proteins have become available and these have been used to develop line immunoassays (LIAs) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for detecting these antibodies.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 {{testing is}} {{initially}} by an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) to detect antibodies to HIV-1. Specimens with a nonreactive result from the initial ELISA are considered HIV-negative unless new exposure to an infected partner or partner of unknown HIV status has occurred. Specimens with a reactive ELISA result are retested in duplicate. If the result of either duplicate test is reactive, the specimen is reported as repeatedly reactive and undergoes confirmatory testing with a more specific supplemental test (e.g., western blot or, less commonly, an <b>immunofluorescence</b> assay (IFA)). Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or reactive by western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection. Specimens that are repeatedly ELISA-reactive occasionally provide an indeterminate western blot result, which may be either an incomplete antibody response to HIV in an infected person or nonspecific reactions in an uninfected person.|$|E
5|$|In research, {{purified}} antibodies {{are used}} in many applications. Antibodies for research applications can be found directly from antibody suppliers, or through use of a specialist search engine. Research antibodies are most commonly used to identify and locate intracellular and extracellular proteins. Antibodies {{are used in}} flow cytometry to differentiate cell types by the proteins they express; different types of cell express different combinations of cluster of differentiation molecules on their surface, and produce different intracellular and secretable proteins. They are also used in immunoprecipitation to separate proteins and anything bound to them (co-immunoprecipitation) from other molecules in a cell lysate, in Western blot analyses to identify proteins separated by electrophoresis, and in immunohistochemistry or <b>immunofluorescence</b> to examine protein expression in tissue sections or to locate proteins within cells {{with the assistance of}} a microscope. Proteins can also be detected and quantified with antibodies, using ELISA and ELISPOT techniques.|$|E
25|$|DirectHit {{is based}} on {{quantitative}} <b>immunofluorescence</b> technology. According to recent studies, quantitative <b>immunofluorescence</b> (QIF) {{can be applied to}} the standardization of protein analysis, resulting in increased sensitivity and reproducibility. It is important to be able to quantitate the expression of predictive factors in breast cancer, because response to therapy is often dependent upon the concentration of particular proteins within the tissue.|$|E
25|$|SeV induces lesions {{within the}} {{respiratory}} tract, {{usually associated with}} bacterial inflammation of the trachea and lung (tracheitis and bronchopneumonia, respectively). However, the lesions are limited, and aren't indicative solely of SeV infection. Detection, therefore, makes use of SeV-specific antigens in several serological methods, including ELISA, <b>immunofluorescence,</b> and hemagglutination assays, with particular emphasis on use of the ELISA for its high sensitivity (unlike the hemagglutination assay) and its fairly early detection (unlike the <b>immunofluorescence</b> assay).|$|E
25|$|Viral {{culture or}} <b>immunofluorescence</b> {{staining}} {{may be used}} to differentiate herpes simplex from herpes zoster in cases that are difficult to distinguish clinically.|$|E
25|$|Antinuclear {{antibody}} (ANA) {{testing and}} anti-extractable nuclear antigen (anti-ENA) form {{the mainstay of}} serologic testing for SLE. Several techniques are used to detect ANAs. Clinically {{the most widely used}} method is indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> (IF). The pattern of fluorescence suggests the type of antibody present in the people's serum. Direct <b>immunofluorescence</b> can detect deposits of immunoglobulins and complement proteins in the people's skin. When skin not exposed to the sun is tested, a positive direct IF (the so-called lupus band test) is an evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus.|$|E
25|$|Ideally, {{multiple}} core sections are obtained and evaluated for adequacy (presence of glomeruli) intraoperatively. A pathologist/pathology assistant divides the specimen(s) for submission for light microscopy, <b>immunofluorescence</b> microscopy and electron microscopy.|$|E
25|$|The disease derives {{its name}} from {{deposits}} of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in a granular pattern in the mesangium (by <b>immunofluorescence),</b> a region of the renal glomerulus. The mesangium by light microscopy may be hypercellular and show increased deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. In terms of the renal manifestation of Henoch–Schönlein purpura, {{it has been found}} that although it shares the same histological spectrum as IgA nephropathy, a greater frequency of severe lesions such as glomerular necrosis and crescents were observed. Correspondingly, HSP nephritis has a higher frequency of glomerular staining for fibrin compared with IgAN, but with an otherwise similar <b>immunofluorescence</b> profile.|$|E
25|$|A {{flow cytometer}} {{can be used}} for the direct {{analysis}} of cells expressing one or more specific proteins. Cells are immunostained in solution using methods similar to those used for <b>immunofluorescence,</b> and then analysed by flow cytometry.|$|E
25|$|Electron microscopy, enzyme-immunoassay (ELISA), <b>immunofluorescence,</b> and {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} have all been used for detecting virus particle, antigens or viral nucleic acid in the stools of infected people. A method using real-time RT-PCR, which can detect all human astrovirus genotypes, has been reported.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of ANAs in blood {{can be confirmed}} by a screening test. Although there are many tests {{for the detection of}} ANAs, the most common tests used for screening are indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Following detection of ANAs, various subtypes are determined.|$|E

25|$|Anti-dsDNA {{antibodies}} are a {{group of}} anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) the target antigen of which is double stranded DNA. Blood tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and <b>immunofluorescence</b> are routinely performed to detect anti-dsDNA antibodies in diagnostic laboratories. They are highly diagnostic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and are implicated in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis.|$|E
25|$|Molecular methods (PCR) of {{diagnosis}} are possible, but not routinely available for clinical diagnosis. Fluorescence {{in situ hybridisation}} has also been described, but has not been clinically validated, {{and it is not}} commercially available. In Thailand, a latex agglutination assay is widely used, while a rapid <b>immunofluorescence</b> technique is also available in a small number of centres.|$|E
25|$|For diagnosis, the {{erythrocytes}} can {{be isolated}} by injecting {{them into a}} tissue culture and {{checking to see if}} they are infected. Also, the antigen for Colorado tick fever virus can be identified using the <b>immunofluorescence</b> microscopy. In this method, the antigens {{on the surface of the}} erythrocytes are marked with fluorescence and examined under a fluorescence microscope.|$|E
25|$|The ANA test detects the autoantibodies {{present in}} an individual's blood serum. The common tests used for {{detecting}} and quantifying ANAs are indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> and {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA). In <b>immunofluorescence,</b> the level of autoantibodies is reported as a titre. This is the highest dilution of the serum at which autoantibodies are still detectable. Positive autoantibody titres at a dilution {{equal to or greater}} than 1:160 are usually considered as clinically significant. Positive titres of less than 1:160 are present in up to 20% of the healthy population, especially the elderly. Although positive titres of 1:160 or higher are strongly associated with autoimmune disorders, they are also found in 5% of healthy individuals. Autoantibody screening is useful in the diagnosis of autoimmune disorders and monitoring levels helps to predict the progression of disease. A positive ANA test is seldom useful if other clinical or laboratory data supporting a diagnosis are not present.|$|E
25|$|The {{pathologist}} {{will examine}} the specimen using light microscopy with multiple staining techniques (hematoxylin and eosin/H, PAS, trichrome, silver stain) on multiple level sections. Multiple <b>immunofluorescence</b> stains {{are performed to evaluate}} for antibody, protein and complement deposition. Finally, ultra-structural examination is performed with electron microscopy and may reveal the presence of electron-dense deposits or other characteristic abnormalities that may suggest an etiology for the patient's renal disease.|$|E
25|$|Once {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{for a given}} substance {{have been}} produced, {{they can be used}} to detect the presence of this substance. The Western blot test and immuno dot blot tests detect the protein on a membrane. They are also very useful in immunohistochemistry, which detect antigen in fixed tissue sections and <b>immunofluorescence</b> test, which detect the substance in a frozen tissue section or in live cells.|$|E
25|$|Colorado {{tick fever}} virus can be {{detected}} in a patient with a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), where even a single virion and its genetic material {{can be detected}}. The antigens to the virus can also be detected using <b>immunofluorescence.</b> There is currently no known vaccine or treatment available to treat these Coltiviruses, but 3'-fluors-3'-deoxyadanosine, a nucleoside analog, halts replication of Colorado tick fever virus in vitro.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} if the patient is afflicted with paraneoplastic pemphigus, several tests may be performed. Initially, samples are obtained via skin biopsy for routine microscopy and direct <b>immunofluorescence</b> (DIF) testing. The skin sample should be obtained from an unaffected area adjacent to a lesion. Testing in more detail follows depending on the results from the DIF. Prompt diagnosis of PNP is crucial due to the high mortality rate of the disease.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of {{autoimmune}} disorders largely rests on accurate history and physical {{examination of the}} patient, and high index of suspicion {{against a backdrop of}} certain abnormalities in routine laboratory tests (example, elevated C-reactive protein). In several systemic disorders, serological assays which can detect specific autoantibodies can be employed. Localised disorders are best diagnosed by <b>immunofluorescence</b> of biopsy specimens. Autoantibodies are used to diagnose many autoimmune diseases. The levels of autoantibodies are measured to determine the progress of the disease.|$|E
25|$|Crithidia luciliae are haemoflaggelate single celled protists. They {{are used}} as a {{substrate}} in <b>immunofluorescence</b> {{for the detection of}} anti-dsDNA antibodies. They possess an organelle known as the kinetoplast which is a large mitochondrion with a network of interlocking circular dsDNA molecules. After incubation with serum containing anti-dsDNA antibodies and fluorescent-labelled anti-human antibodies, the kinetoplast will fluoresce. The lack of other nuclear antigens in this organelle means that using C.luciliae as a substrate allows for the specific detection of anti-dsDNA antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Renal {{pathology}} is a subspecialty of anatomic pathology {{that deals}} with the diagnosis and characterization of disease of the kidneys. In a medical setting, renal pathologists work closely with nephrologists and transplant surgeons, who typically obtain diagnostic specimens via percutaneous renal biopsy. The renal pathologist must synthesize findings from traditional microscope histology, electron microscopy, and <b>immunofluorescence</b> to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Medical renal diseases may affect the glomerulus, the tubules and interstitium, the vessels, {{or a combination of}} these compartments.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} comes {{mostly from}} the history and examination, but the following special investigations may be involved: blood tests (vitamin deficiency, anemia, leukemia, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV infection, diabetes) microbiological swabs (infection), or urinalysis (diabetes). A biopsy (minor procedure to cut out {{a small sample of}} the ulcer to look at under a microscope) with or without <b>immunofluorescence</b> may be required, to rule out cancer, but also if a systemic disease is suspected. Ulcers caused by local trauma are painful to touch and sore. They usually have an irregular border with erythematous margins and the base is yellow. As healing progresses, a keratotic (thickened, white mucosa) halo may occur.|$|E
25|$|Anti-DFS70 {{antibodies}} {{generate a}} dense fine speckled pattern in indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> and {{are found in}} normals and in various conditions, but are not associated with a systemic autoimmune pathology. Therefore, {{they can be used}} to help to rule out such conditions in ANA positive individuals. A significant number of patients are diagnosed as systemic lupus erythematosus or undifferentiated connective tissue disease largely based on a positive ANA. In case no defined autoantibody can be detected (e.g. anti-ENA antibodies), the testing of anti-DFS70 antibodies is recommended to verify the diagnosis. Anti-DFS70 antibody tests are available as CE-marked tests. Until now, no FDA cleared assay is available.|$|E
25|$|<b>Immunofluorescence</b> (IF) on ethanol-fixed {{neutrophils}} is used {{to detect}} ANCA, although formalin-fixed neutrophils {{may be used to}} help differentiate ANCA patterns. ANCA can be divided into four patterns when visualised by IF; cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA), C-ANCA (atypical), perinuclear ANCA (p-ANCA) and atypical ANCA (a-ANCA), also known as x-ANCA. c-ANCA shows cytoplasmic granular fluorescence with central interlobular accentuation. c-ANCA (atypical) shows cytoplasmic staining that is usually uniform and has no interlobular accentuation. p-ANCA has three subtypes, classical p-ANCA, p-ANCA without nuclear extension and granulocyte specific-antinuclear antibody (GS-ANA). Classical p-ANCA shows perinuclear staining with nuclear extension, p-ANCA without nuclear extension has perinuclear staining without nuclear extension and GS-ANA shows nuclear staining on granulocytes only. a-ANCA often shows combinations of both cytoplasmic and perinuclear staining.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} can {{be confirmed}} by the characteristic appearance of the chest x-ray, which shows widespread pulmonary infiltrates, and an arterial oxygen level (PaO2) that is strikingly lower than would be expected from symptoms. Gallium 67 scans are also useful in the diagnosis. They are abnormal in approximately 90% of cases and are often positive before the chest x-ray becomes abnormal. The diagnosis can be definitively confirmed by histological identification of the causative organism in sputum or bronchio-alveolar lavage (lung rinse). Staining with toluidine blue, silver stain, periodic-acid schiff stain, or an <b>immunofluorescence</b> assay will show the characteristic cysts. The cysts resemble crushed ping-pong balls and are present in aggregates of 2 to 8 (and {{not to be confused}} with Histoplasma or Cryptococcus, which typically do not form aggregates of spores or cells). A lung biopsy would show thickened alveolar septa with fluffy eosinophilic exudate in the alveoli. Both the thickened septa and the fluffy exudate contribute to dysfunctional diffusion capacity which is characteristic of this pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) uses antigen-coated microtitre plates for the {{detection}} of ANAs. Each well of a microtitre plate is coated with either a single antigen or multiple antigens to detect specific antibodies or to screen for ANAs, respectively. The antigens are either from cell extracts or recombinant. Blood serum is incubated in the wells of the plate and is washed out. If antibodies that bind to antigen are present then they will remain after washing. A secondary anti-human antibody conjugated to an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase. The enzyme reaction will produce a change in colour of the solution that is proportional to the amount of antibody bound to the antigen. There are significant differences in {{the detection}} of ANA by <b>immunofluorescence</b> and different ELISA kits and there is only a marginal agreement between these. A clinician must be familiar with the differences in order to evaluate the outcomes of the various assays.|$|E
25|$|For {{an adult}} patient with {{isolated}} hematuria, tests such as ultrasound of the kidney and cystoscopy are usually done first {{to pinpoint the}} source of the bleeding. These tests would rule out kidney stones and bladder cancer, two other common urological causes of hematuria. In children and younger adults, the history and association with respiratory infection can raise the suspicion of IgA nephropathy. A kidney biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy specimen shows proliferation of the mesangium, with IgA deposits on <b>immunofluorescence</b> and electron microscopy. However, patients with isolated microscopic hematuria (i.e. without associated proteinuria and with normal kidney function) are not usually biopsied since this is associated with an excellent prognosis. A urinalysis will show red blood cells, usually as red cell urinary casts. Proteinuria, usually less than 2grams per day, also may be present. Other renal causes of isolated hematuria include thin basement membrane disease and Alport syndrome, the latter being a hereditary disease associated with hearing impairment and eye problems.|$|E
500|$|List of <b>immunofluorescence</b> {{findings}} for autoimmune bullous conditions ...|$|E
500|$|They {{are usually}} not {{produced}} in a natural immune response, but only in diseased states like multiple myeloma, or through specialized laboratory techniques. Because of their specificity, monoclonal antibodies are used in certain applications to quantify or detect the presence of substances (which act as antigen for the monoclonal antibodies), and for targeting individual cells (e.g. cancer cells). [...] Monoclonal antibodies find use in various diagnostic modalities (see: western blot and <b>immunofluorescence)</b> and therapies—particularly of cancer and diseases with autoimmune component. But, since virtually all responses in nature are polyclonal, it makes production of immensely useful monoclonal antibodies less straightforward.|$|E
2500|$|Until around 1975, when HEp-2 {{cells were}} introduced, animal tissue {{was used as}} the {{standard}} substrate for <b>immunofluorescence.</b> HEp-2 cells are currently {{one of the most common}} substrates for ANA detection by <b>immunofluorescence.</b>|$|E
