25|$|Death in Islam is the {{termination}} of worldly life {{and the beginning of}} afterlife. Death is seen as the separation of soul from body, and its transfer from this world to the afterlife. Thus, it is the continuation of life in another form. Death is seen as a painful experience in Islam for <b>kafir.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following {{his claim}} to be the Promised Messiah and Mahdi, one of his adversaries {{prepared}} a Fatwa (decree) of disbelief against Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, declaring him a <b>Kafir</b> (disbeliever), a deceiver, and a liar. The decree permitted killing him and his followers. It was taken all around India and was signed by some two hundred religious scholars.|$|E
25|$|Al-Qaeda {{has carried}} out many attacks on targets it {{considers}} <b>kafir.</b> Al-Qaeda is {{also responsible for}} instigating sectarian violence among Muslims. Al-Qaeda's leaders regard liberal Muslims, Shias, Sufis and other sects as heretical and its members and sympathizers have attacked their mosques and gatherings. Examples of sectarian attacks include the Yazidi community bombings, the Sadr City bombings, the Ashoura massacre and the April 2007 Baghdad bombings.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1895, the <b>Kafirs</b> of Hindukush were {{classified}} {{into two groups}} as (i) Siah-Posh and (ii) Safed-Posh. But the British investigator George Scott Robertson who visited Kafiristan and studied the <b>Kafirs</b> {{for about two years}} (1889-1891) had improved upon the old classification and re-classified the <b>Kafirs</b> more scientifically into (1) Siah-Posh, (2) Waigulis, (3) Presungulis, or Viron people and (4) Ashkuns. The Ashukuns are probably allied to the Waigulis. The later three groups of the <b>Kafirs</b> used to be collectively known as Sped-Posh <b>Kafirs.</b>|$|R

25|$|If {{a person}} {{has never been a}} Muslim, and is a <b>kafir</b> (infidel, unbeliever), sharia demands that he or she should be offered the choice to convert to Islam and become a Muslim; if he or she rejects the offer, he or she may become a dhimmi. Failure to pay the tax may lead the non-Muslim to either be enslaved, killed or ransomed if captured.|$|E
25|$|If {{a person}} {{has never been a}} Muslim, and is not a <b>kafir</b> (infidel, unbeliever), he or she can live in an Islamic state by {{accepting}} to be a dhimmi, or under a special permission called aman. As a dhimmi or under aman, he or she will suffer certain limitations of rights as a subject of an Islamic state, and will not enjoy complete legal equality with Muslims.|$|E
25|$|Hassan {{issued a}} {{religious}} ordinance stipulating that any Somali national {{who did not}} accept the goal of unity of Somalia and would not fight under his leadership would {{be considered to be}} <b>kafir,</b> or gaal. He soon acquired weapons from the Ottoman Empire, Sudan, other Islamic and Arabian countries, and appointed ministers and advisers to administer different areas or sectors of Somalia. In addition, he gave a clarion call for Somali unity and independence, in the process organizing his forces.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{scholars}} have connected the names Katir/Kator/Kata and Kam/Kom with ancient Kambojas and identified the <b>Kafirs,</b> especially the Siah-Posh <b>Kafirs,</b> as having descended from ancient Kambojas.|$|R
50|$|Nicholas Barrington et al. {{report that}} the Sped-Posh <b>Kafirs</b> (Waigulis and Presungulis) refer to all Siah-Posh <b>Kafirs</b> (including the Kamoz) as Katirs and regard them of the same stock linguistically and ethnographically.|$|R
50|$|Siah-Posh (black-Robed) <b>Kafirs</b> used to {{designate}} the major and dominant {{group of the}} Hindu Kush <b>Kafirs</b> inhabiting the Bashgul (Kam) valley of the Kafiristan, now called Nuristan. They were so-called {{because of the color}} of the robes they wore. They were distinguished from the Sped-Posh (white-robed) <b>Kafirs</b> (sometimes also called Lal-Posh or Red-robed) by reason of the color of their dress as also because of their language, customs and other characteristics. The Siah-Posh <b>Kafirs</b> (Nuristanis) have sometimes been erroneously confused with Kalasha people, though they are not directly related to the Kalash of the neighboring Chitral Province in Pakistan.|$|R
25|$|Dalrymple further {{points out}} that as late as 6 September, when calling the {{inhabitants}} of Delhi to rally against the upcoming British assault, Zafar issued a proclamation stating {{that this was a}} religious war being prosecuted on behalf of 'the faith', and that all Muslim and Hindu residents of the imperial city, or of the countryside were encouraged to stay true to their faith and creeds. As further evidence, he observes that the Urdu sources of the pre and post-rebellion periods usually refer to the British not as angrez (the English), goras (whites) or firangis (foreigners), but as <b>kafir</b> (infidels) and nasrani (Christians).|$|E

500|$|The {{family first}} {{appears in the}} northeastern corner of the Byzantine world, the {{province}} of Chaldia, centred on Trebizond. The family's ethnic origin is unknown. Some scholars like Alexander Vasiliev and Alexander Kazhdan suggested an Armenian origin, as with many other aristocratic families of the time, but the surname [...] "Gabras" [...] is neither Armenian nor Greek. Persian and Aramaic origins for the name have been suggested, including a suggestion by Konstantinos Amantos {{that it is a}} corruption of the name [...] "Gabriel". The historian Anthony Bryer, however, considers more likely that the name is a cognate of the Arabic <b>kafir,</b> Persian gabr or Turkish gavur, terms meaning [...] "infidel" [...] or [...] "unbeliever", which is appropriate for the Christian–Muslim borderlands where the Gabrades first appear. It seems that the Gabrades arose from the Inner Pontus, a region with its own distinct identity: a mountainous area, it was scarcely affected by Hellenization and preserved a traditional and archaic societal structure, with tiny lordships centred on mountain strong-holds.|$|E
50|$|The first {{reference}} to Siah-Posh <b>Kafirs</b> occurs in Timur's invasion of Afghanistan in 1398 CE.

2500|$|Some {{scholars}} claim sharia allows {{religious freedom}} because a sharia verse teaches, [...] "there is no compulsion in religion." [...] Other scholars claim sharia recognizes only one proper religion, considers apostasy as sin punishable with death, {{and members of}} other religions as <b>kafir</b> (infidel); or hold that sharia demands that all apostates and <b>kafir</b> must be put to death, enslaved or be ransomed. Yet other scholars suggest that sharia has become a product of human interpretation and inevitably leads to disagreements about the “precise contents of the Shari'a." [...] In the end, then, what is being applied is not sharia, but what a particular group of clerics and government decide is sharia. It is these differing interpretations of sharia that explain why many Islamic countries have laws that restrict and criminalize apostasy, proselytism and their citizens' freedom of conscience and religion.|$|E
