5000|$|American <b>Morse</b> <b>Code</b> — {{also known}} as Railroad Morse—is the latter-day name for the {{original}} version of the <b>Morse</b> <b>Code</b> developed in the mid-1840s, by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail for their electric telegraph. The [...] "American" [...] qualifier was added because, after {{most of the rest}} of the world adopted [...] "International Morse Code," [...] the companies that continued to use the original <b>Morse</b> <b>Code</b> were mainly located in the United States. American Morse is now nearly extinct—it is most frequently seen in American railroad museums and American Civil War reenactments—and [...] "Morse Code" [...] today virtually always means the <b>International</b> <b>Morse</b> which supplanted American Morse.|$|R
50|$|Over time, {{with the}} {{disappearance}} of landline telegraphy, {{and the end of}} commercial radio use of <b>Morse</b> <b>Code,</b> American <b>Morse</b> has become nearly extinct in some states. In the United States, the ranks of amateur radio operators used to include many active and retired commercial landline telegraph operators, who preferred to use American Morse for their amateur radio transmissions, so the CW (continuous wave) amateur bands used to have a mixture of American and <b>International</b> <b>Morse.</b> However, today even U.S. amateurs use <b>International</b> <b>Morse</b> almost exclusively.|$|R

[...] Even after this, the original <b>Morse</b> <b>Code</b> continued to be used throughout much of the United States. American Morse remained the standard for U.S. landline telegraph companies, including the dominant company, Western Union, in part because the original code, with fewer dashes, could be sent about 5% faster than <b>International</b> <b>Morse.</b> American Morse also was commonly used for domestic radio transmissions on the Great Lakes, and along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. However, <b>International</b> <b>Morse</b> predominated for ocean-going vessels, and many U.S. shipboard operators became skilled in transmitting both versions of the Code as needed.|$|R

25|$|Morse code {{has been}} in use for more than 160 yearslonger than any other {{electrical}} coding system. What is called Morse code today is actually somewhat different from what was originally developed by Vail and Morse. The Modern <b>International</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>code,</b> or continental code, was created by Friedrich Clemens Gerke in 1848 and initially used for telegraphy between Hamburg and Cuxhaven in Germany. Gerke changed {{nearly half of the}} alphabet and all of the numerals, providing the foundation for the modern form of the code. After some minor changes, <b>International</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>Code</b> was standardized at the International Telegraphy Congress in 1865 in Paris and was later made the standard by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Morse's original code specification, largely limited to use in the United States and Canada, became known as American Morse code or railroad code. American Morse code is now seldom used except in historical re-enactments.|$|E
25|$|Modern <b>International</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> (generally {{believed}} to have been developed by Alfred Vail based on English-language letter frequencies of the 1830s) encodes the most frequent letters with the shortest symbols; arranging the Morse alphabet into groups of letters that require equal amounts of time to transmit, and then sorting these groups in increasing order, yields e it san hurdm wgvlfbk opxcz jyq. Similar ideas are used in modern data-compression techniques such as Huffman coding.|$|E
25|$|In the 1890s, <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> {{began to}} be used {{extensively}} for early radio communication, before {{it was possible to}} transmit voice. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most high-speed <b>international</b> communication used <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> on telegraph lines, undersea cables and radio circuits. In aviation, <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> in radio systems started to be used on a regular basis in the 1920s. Although previous transmitters were bulky and the spark gap system of transmission was difficult to use, there had been some earlier attempts. In 1910, the US Navy experimented with sending Morse from an airplane. That same year, a radio on the airship America had been instrumental in coordinating the rescue of its crew. Zeppelin airships equipped with radio were used for bombing and naval scouting during World War I, and ground-based radio direction finders were used for airship navigation. Allied airships and military aircraft also made some use of radiotelegraphy. However, there was little aeronautical radio in general use during World War I, and in the 1920s, there was no radio system used by such important flights as that of Charles Lindbergh from New York to Paris in 1927. Once he and the Spirit of St. Louis were off the ground, Lindbergh was truly alone and incommunicado. On the other hand, when the first airplane flight was made from California to Australia in 1928 on the Southern Cross, one of its four crewmen was its radio operator who communicated with ground stations via radio telegraph.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the broadcast, the state of radio {{communications}} had not yet reached the point where vacuum tubes would be used in universal voice transmission; and instead, intelligence was commonly conveyed by dots and dashes using the <b>International</b> <b>Morse</b> radiotelegraph <b>code.</b> Transmissions by code are inherently much slower than by voice and its normal rate of speed is in the vicinity of 20 words or 100 characters per minute. This is too slow to keep up with gridiron activities and therefore, a system of abbreviations had to be devised. It so happened that Harry Saunders (now deceased) had previously worked as an operator with Western Union and was familiar with methods used by commercial telegraph companies in furnishing the play-by-play accounts of football and baseball games to newspapers, private sporting clubs, etc. When it was mentioned on the air to the operators at the University of Texas that such a list of abbreviations was being prepared, numerous requests for a copy of the list were received by radio and by mail from some of the 275 then licensed amateur radio operators in the state. Thus, what had started out to be a point-to-point broadcast, {{turned out to be one}} with many listeners.|$|R
5000|$|In {{both the}} April 1, 1905, German law, and the 1906 International regulations, the {{distress}} signal was specified {{as a continuous}} <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> sequence of three-dots/three-dashes/three-dots, with no mention of any alphabetic equivalents. However, in <b>International</b> <b>Morse,</b> three dots comprise the letter S, and three dashes the letter O. It therefore soon became common {{to refer to the}} distress signal as [...] "SOS". An early report on [...] "The International Radio-Telegraphic Convention" [...] in the January 12, 1907, Electrical World stated that [...] "Vessels in distress use the special signal, SOS, repeated at short intervals." [...] (In American <b>Morse</b> <b>code,</b> which was used by many coastal ships in the United States through {{the first part of the}} twentieth century, three dashes stood for the numeral [...] "5", so in a few cases the distress signal was informally referred to as [...] "S5S".) ...|$|R
25|$|Beginning in 1836, the American artist Samuel F. B. Morse, the American {{physicist}} Joseph Henry, and Alfred Vail {{developed an}} electrical telegraph system. This system sent pulses of electric current along wires which controlled an electromagnet that was {{located at the}} receiving end of the telegraph system. A code was needed to transmit natural language using only these pulses, and the silence between them. Around 1837, Morse, therefore, developed an early forerunner to the modern <b>International</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>code.</b> Around the same time, Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Eduard Weber (1833) as well as Carl August von Steinheil (1837) had already used codes with varying word lengths for their telegraphs.|$|E
2500|$|The Morse code, {{as it is}} used internationally today, {{was derived}} from a much refined {{proposal}} which became known as [...] "Hamburg alphabet" [...] by Friedrich Clemens Gerke in 1848. It {{was adopted by the}} Deutsch-Österreichischer Telegraphenverein (German-Austrian Telegraph Society) in 1851. This finally led to the <b>International</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> in 1865.|$|E
2500|$|<b>International</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> {{today is}} most popular among amateur radio operators, {{in the mode}} {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "continuous wave" [...] or [...] "CW". (This name was chosen to distinguish it from the damped wave emissions from spark transmitters, not because the transmission is continuous.) Other keying methods are available in radio telegraphy, such as frequency shift keying.|$|E

This thesis explored the strategies used to teach and learn <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> in the second World War and investigated the resourceful techniques used by the WRANS in an empirical study. The first study investigated {{the teaching and learning}} strategies of wartime telegraphists to learn <b>Morse</b> <b>code.</b> Five WRANS described a series of techniques to learn <b>Morse</b> <b>code,</b> including rote learning and repetition, visualisation and pattern recognition, intoning and mnemonics, and music. Music provided effective training for the fundamental teaching and learning of <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> by matching the rhythmical properties of <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> to music. Music equipped <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> operators with a unique approach to <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> instruction. Learning <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> with music was described as a way of making sense of the ‘rhythm’ and ‘shape’ of the <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> letters and proved an invaluable aid to learning and teaching <b>Morse</b> <b>code.</b> The second study examined the effectiveness of learning <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> with the aid of music.

2500|$|Morse code is {{a method}} of {{transmitting}} text information {{as a series of}} on-off tones, lights, or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observer without special equipment.

The <b>International</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>Code</b> encodes the ISO basic Latin alphabet, some extra Latin letters, the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns) as standardized sequences of short and long signals called [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes", or [...] "dits" [...] and [...] "dahs", as in amateur radio practice. Because many non-English natural languages use more than the 26 Roman letters, extensions to the Morse alphabet exist for those languages.|$|E

2500|$|There are claims that, as the Kido Butai (the Striking Force) steamed toward Hawaii, {{radio signals}} were {{detected}} that alerted U.S. intelligence to the imminent attack.

Meaningful rag chewing between fluent <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> operators having different native languages is possible because of a common Lingua Franca provided by: the prosigns for <b>Morse</b> <b>code,</b> the <b>International</b> Q code, Z code, RST code, the telegraph era Phillips Code and many well known <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> abbreviations as discussed in this Wikipedia article.

2500|$|Morse code {{is a type}} of {{character}} encoding that transmits telegraphic information using rhythm. Morse code uses a standardized sequence of short and long elements to represent the letters, numerals, punctuation, and special characters of a given message. After many years of development, an electrical telegraph came to exclusively refer to a signaling telegram, as an operator makes and breaks an electrical contact with a telegraph key, resulting in an audible signal at the other end produced by a telegraph sounder which is interpreted and transcribed by an operator. The short and long elements are formed by sounds, marks, or pulses, in on off keying and are commonly known as [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] or [...] "dits" [...] and [...] "dahs". In 1832, Alfred Vail in collaboration with Samuel Morse, began the process of co-inventing the Morse code signalling alphabet. After a few minor changes, including the development of <b>International</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> which is distinct from the original encoding system, American Morse code, Morse code was standardized in 1865 by the International Telegraphy Congress in Paris, France and later made the norm by the International Telecommunication Union. After 160 years of continuous use, international regulations beginning on January 31, 1999, no longer required ships at sea to call for help in an emergency using Morse code or the famous SOS signal.|$|E
2500|$|After World War II, amateur radio {{operators}} in the US started to receive obsolete but usable Teletype Model 26 equipment from commercial operators {{with the understanding}} that this equipment would not be used for or returned to commercial service. [...] "The Amateur Radioteletype and VHF Society" [...] was founded in 1946 in Woodside, NY. This organization soon changed its name to [...] "The VHF Teletype Society" [...] and started US Amateur Radio operations on 2 meters using audio frequency shift keying (AFSK). The first two-way amateur radioteletype QSO of record took place in May 1946 between Dave Winters, W2AUF, Brooklyn, NY and W2BFD, John Evans Williams, Woodside Long Island, NY. On the west coast, amateur RTTY also started on 2 meters. Operation on 80 meters, 40 meters and the other High Frequency (HF) amateur radio bands was initially accomplished using make and break keying since frequency shift keying (FSK) was not yet authorized. In early 1949, the first American transcontinental two-way RTTY QSO was accomplished on 11 meters using AFSK between Tom McMullen (W1QVF) operating at W1AW and Johnny Agalsoff, W6PSW. The stations effected partial contact on January 30, 1949, and repeated more successfully on January 31. On February 1, 1949, the stations exchanged solid print congratulatory message traffic and rag-chewed. Earlier, on January 23, 1949, William T. Knott, W2QGH, Larchmont, NY, had been able to make rough copy of W6PSW's test transmissions. While QSOs could be accomplished, it was quickly realized that FSK was technically superior to make and break keying. Due to the efforts of Merrill Swan, W6AEE, of [...] "The RTTY Society of Southern California" [...] publisher of RTTY and Wayne Green, W2NSD, of CQ Magazine, Amateur Radio operators successfully petitioned the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to amend Part 12 of the Regulations, which was effective on February 20, 1953. The amended Regulations permitted FSK in the non-voice parts of the 80, 40 and 20 meter bands and also specified the use of single channel 60 words-per-minute five unit code corresponding to ITA2. A shift of 850 hertz plus or minus 50 hertz was specified. Amateur Radio operators also had to identify their station callsign at {{the beginning and the end}} of each transmission and at ten-minute intervals using <b>International</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>code.</b> Use of this wide shift proved to be a problem for Amateur Radio operations. Commercial operators had already discovered that narrow shift worked best on the HF bands. After investigation and a petition to the FCC, Part 12 was amended, in March 1956, to allow Amateur Radio Operators to use any shift that was less than 900 hertz.|$|E

5000|$|Although <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> preceded modern coded {{modulation}} techniques by {{more than}} a century, in terms of Claude Shannon's modern Information Theory, <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> may be regarded essentially as an encoded method of signaling that simultaneously comprises both: a source code (data compression code) and a channel code (modulation <b>code).</b> The <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> source code was created by Samuel Morse's assistant Alfred Vail when Vail assigned the shortest <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> symbols to the most often occurring (English language) source symbols (alpha-numeric characters and punctuation marks), in the style of today's modern data compression codes such as the modern Information Theory based: Huffman, Arithmetic, and Lempel-Ziv-Welsh <b>codes.</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> symbols are variable length sequences of: dot signals, dash signals, and dot duration silent periods.
