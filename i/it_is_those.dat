25|$|It follows that, in general, the {{defenders}} of the new calendar hold the view that in localities where the Church's episcopal authority has elected to adopt the new calendar, but where some have broken communion with those implementing this change, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>those</b> who have broken communion who have in fact introduced the disunity, rather than the new calendar itself or those who have adopted it— although most would agree that attempts at various times to mandate {{the use of the}} new calendar through compulsion, have magnified the disunity.|$|E
25|$|In all, ten {{national}} women's {{teams have}} competed in Test cricket. The England team's tour of Australia and New Zealand in the 1934–35 season established {{the first three}} sides, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>those</b> three teams that have competed in Test cricket most frequently; each having played at least 45 matches. South Africa were the next side to play the format, contesting their first match in 1960. However, {{due in part to}} their exclusion from international sport due to the nation's apartheid policy, they have only played in eleven Test matches, less than both India and the West Indies. Four sides—Pakistan, Ireland, the Netherlands and Sri Lanka—have all competed in fewer than five Test matches.|$|E

25|$|Stephen Hawking {{had shown}} earlier {{that the total}} horizon area of a {{collection}} of black holes always increases with time. The horizon is a boundary defined by light-like geodesics; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>those</b> light rays that are just barely unable to escape. If neighboring geodesics start moving toward each other they eventually collide, at which point their extension is inside the black hole. So the geodesics are always moving apart, and the number of geodesics which generate the boundary, the area of the horizon, always increases. Hawking's result was called the second law of black hole thermodynamics, by analogy with the law of entropy increase, but at first, he did not take the analogy too seriously.|$|E
25|$|Rwanda’s {{experiment}} in mass community-based justice {{has been a}} mixed success. Many Rwandans agree that it has shed light on what happened in their local communities during the 100 days of genocide in 1994, even {{if not all of}} the truth was revealed. They say it helped some families find murdered relatives’ bodies which they could finally bury with some dignity. It has also ensured that tens of thousands of perpetrators were brought to justice. Some Rwandans say that it has helped set in motion reconciliation within their communities. The majority of praise for Gacaca has come from Rwanda's government and the Rwandan citizens who have direct experience with the system. Naturally this is a biased source, however {{it is important to note}} that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>those</b> most affected by the Rwandan genocide who are offering praise, citing a sense of closure, acceptance, and forgiveness following Gacaca trials. The Gacaca trials also served to promote reconciliation by providing a means for victims to learn the truth about the death of their family members and relatives. They also gave perpetrators the opportunity to confess their crimes, show remorse and ask for forgiveness in front of their community.|$|E
25|$|Network Externality {{positively}} {{affects the}} cultural commons in many ways. The reward for {{being part of}} a group, society, and even the world through a P2P network {{is one of the greatest}} benefits that a modern common-pool resource can provide.The ability to connect and create with people from different cultures, ethnicities, and beliefs is something thought to be impossible 100 years ago. Without network externality this form of communication would have been impossible. Through P2P sharing the world as a culture are able to learn and teach each other through public forums. In Sugata Mitra’s Ted talk, “The child-driven education” he placed a computer in a third world town and left it there to see what would happen. To his amazement children were able to quickly figure out how to use the computer and educate themselves on its inner workings. This example is a benefit to society for several reasons. The first is the relationship between Sugata Mitra and the P2P network which led him to place the computer in a third world town, along with the ability to present his findings on a public forum. Secondly, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>those</b> who consumed his ted talk and benefited from the knowledge that those in third world countries just need a chance to learn and they will take it. This experiment as a whole brings the culture of the world together and connects us with those we thought impossible due to the P2P network and network externality that led individuals to the Ted talk.|$|E

Initial activity focused on the village of Weissenfels, where the middle Saale emerges from the Buntsandstein of the Thuringian Basin in the Leipzig highlands, not far from the modern-day A9 highway; the locale lies [...] from the town of Saale and [...] southwest of Jena. Parts of the valley between Leipzig and Saale were relatively narrow, cut by the river and its tributaries; the hillsides were steep, and there were limited river crossings; this influenced the troop movements leading to the battle, as the various armies competed for sites to cross the river.|$|E
