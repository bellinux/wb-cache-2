In the US, this has led to the implementation of punitive and adversarial regulation that has sought to improve the quality of prescribing in this healthcare setting. This approach is unique to the US and has not been replicated elsewhere. The literature has revealed that there are limitations as to how much can be achieved with regulation that is externally imposed (an 'external factor'). Other influences, which may be categorised as 'internal factors' operating within the care home (e. g. patient, physician and care-home characteristics), also affect prescribing. However, these internal and external factors do not appear to affect prescribing uniformly, and poor prescribing practices in care homes continue to be observed. One <b>intangible</b> <b>factor</b> that has received little attention in this area of healthcare is that of organisational culture.

The sample was comprised of 2, 027 users of Spanish sports services, of whom 66. 1 % were men and 33. 9 % were women. All users completed a self-administered questionnaire. The psychometric properties of the questionnaire ensured a valid measurement of perceived quality, satisfaction and value. The results obtained revealed that the quality of the sports service received was good, and that the technical factors and service staff received the highest evaluations, however, information provided to users was the weakest point. Customer satisfaction and perceived value were also assessed positively. Significant differences were found in these three constructs depending on the activity group that the users were in. Combat activities scored highest for quality, and lowest for satisfaction, whereas customers of individual land-based sports were the most satisfied and perceived the most value, unlike racquet sports, which obtained the lowest scores in the three constructs.

This was done without changing the basic methodological principle to which the specific ‘LEADER added value’ is attributed: bottom-up approach, territorial and integrated approach to rural development, public-private partnership in local action groups (LAGs), territorial networking and transnational cooperation to stimulate rural innovation processes. In other words, LEADER is a “network policy” {{in the sense that it}} looks at different types of networks with a multi-purpose intent. Firstly, at the ‘social’ network, which addresses the <b>intangible</b> <b>factor</b> of development through reinforcing the sense of local identity of the rural population, as well as the external image of the territory. This boosts marketing of local products (Ray 1998), because in LEADER a thread connects the sociological entity ‘community’ and the geographical entity ‘territory’ “that can be linked with an identifiable cultural heritage and identity” (Lee et al. 2005 : 275), as can the socio-economic entity ‘social capital’. Secondly, the ‘horizontal’ network, as Murdoch (2000) put it, “linked to more general and also non-agricultural processes”, which aims at integrated development of rural economy in a defined area. Thirdly, the ‘vertical’ network, which links actors of a specific area because of their involvement in the agro-food sector (Murdoch 2000).|$|E

40|$|In this article, a {{principal}} place {{is given to}} the question of how the ways we conceptualize the use of our mind influence the generation of social power. We define social power as the potency of socially integrated individuals to accomplish specific predetermined values. These values can be related to anything from concrete material prosperity to abstract social and cultural goals. How are the goals accomplished? Are there principles or laws that govern the process? What is the role of the individual in this process? We argue that the development of social power requires an understanding not only of the heterogeneity of individual and social structure, but also of the subtle phenomena that give dynamism to the structure itself. We assume this <b>intangible</b> <b>factor</b> to be the container of social energy and consider that stimulating unique individual capacities to its maximum expression is crucial for the production of social power. Accordingly, we ask ourselves what progress in the way we think can bring us closer to the maximum expression of individual capacity. Maximum contribution of each individual in diverse aspects of social functioning is an applied form of unity in diversity—diversity referring to a unique capacity of each individual, and unity being a harmonious collective of unique individuals. As a case study, we choose the phenomenon of multicultural environment, as a context in which the highest variety of individual frameworks are brought into relationship with one another...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn recent years, farmers’ {{markets have}} been rapidly {{spreading}} {{due to their}} ability {{to meet the needs of}} consumers who are guided by ethical, responsible and green values. By purchasing fresh, organic and local products at farmers’ markets, consumers satisfy their current concerns for nutrition, health, well-being and a return to a “normal” way of living, while also supporting local farmers. Several studies have investigated this phenomenon from either an economic or from a rural-agricultural point of view. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the first stream of studies, and it particularly aims at analyzing the behavior of shoppers who frequent farmers’ markets. Through an empirical analysis conducted on shoppers at three Italian farmers’ markets, this study identifies the profile of such shoppers and determines the reasons for their satisfaction at farmers’ markets. Using a regression analysis, this study suggests and successfully tests the impact of a factor known as “perceived customer-company-territory interaction” (CCTI) on shoppers’ satisfaction. CCTI registers the perceived (intangible) value created through the social-economic interactions among customers, local companies (farms) and their territory. Thus, we found that the shoppers’ satisfaction was not only influenced by tangible aspects, such as the product quality and the comparative price convenience, but that satisfaction is also influenced by the complementary impact of an <b>intangible</b> <b>factor,</b> CCTI. The findings in this study might assist in the development of useful and strategic insights to manage this “new” phenomenon. In particular, the study offers suggestions to several players, including public policy makers, public organizations, farmers’ markets’ organizers and traditional retailers...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{approaches}} to the study on innovations enhance some similar aspects of the innovation process in knowledge-based economies: (i) the systemic and interrelated nature of innovation and (ii) its geographic and inter-economic activities density of networking. One perspective {{is linked to the}} innovation systems approach at the national, regional and local level. What we know so far is that most specialized forms of knowledge are becoming a short lived resource, in face of the (increasingly) fast changes that are ocurring in the global economy; it's the ability to learn permanently and to adapt to this fast changing scenario that determines the innovative performance of firms, regions and countries. Another approach {{is to be found in}} the research on cluster development, where proximity and interrelated technical/technological linkage are the main features to take under consideration. Althought these two approaches operate at slightly different spatial scale of analysis, they both allow the identification of a set of key factors that contribute to understand the way in which institutions and actors, considering the innovation system or the cluster process, participate in the innovation atmosphere and in the economic growth. Nevertheless, both approaches show the same limitation: they tend to focalise into the descriptive and analytical level, disregarding the explanatory level. Local and regional authorities are, mainly, interested in the process of cluster intensificiation in the local and regional economies context. These features stess out one other controversy level: are the "hard" location factors (the concrete tangible location factors) more important than the "soft" location factors (qualitative, <b>intangible</b> <b>factor)</b> or vice-versa?

40|$|Abstract 	Neither {{technological}} nor numerical superiority {{accounts for}} the outcome of most battles. Instead, some <b>intangible</b> <b>factor</b> has historically mattered more. The political science literature has termed this factor `military effectiveness', yet using this phrase to refer solely to efficiency {{in one of the}} many tasks militaries are asked to perform can be dangerous. Armies which are good at conventional combat may be less effective at internal security, for instance. I therefore propose a new term `destructivity' to refer exclusively to military effectiveness in high intensity, conventional warfare. 	Previous literature has suggested a number of factors which may account for variation between states in their levels of destructivity. Wealth, human capital, regime type, ethnic heterogeneity, culture and the external pressures of the international system have all been suggested by past scholars. Quantitative literature has uncovered many broad level correlations which could map onto numerous plausible causal mechanisms, while the qualitative literature has pointed to numerous theories which have remained untested outside the small number of cases which motivated them. 	My dissertation puts forward a unified theory of destructivity based on the recognition that armies are not unitary actors but must be understood in light of the motivations and interactions of the individual officers and men which comprise them. Borrowing a concept from organizational economics, I suggest that an Army is a large scale `rank order tournament' in which individuals enter in the hope of advancement through mastering military skills and performing well in battle. The broader the funnel of entry into these tournaments, the stiffer is competition for advancement and hence the higher the Army's level of skill. It follows from this that whatever restricts entry into the tournament - low literacy, politically motivated restrictions from coup vulnerable leaders and poor prospects for post service employment - reduces destructivity. 	Motivating troops to fight is a complex undertaking. The broader goals of the war by themselves are insufficient as any given soldier's marginal contribution to the outcome of the war is minute. Regrettable though it is to concede, harsh negative punishments such as the death penalty can be effective in deterring the most obvious and observable forms of military shirking. In situations where soldiers' actions are hard to observe, however, negative sanctions are less effective. Here, the concept of peer monitoring, taken from microfinance, is more important - soldiers are deterred from shirking by the prospect of censure from other members of their small groups. 	I first test my theory on a dataset of battles taken from Biddle and Long, Pilster and Boehmelt and Clodfelter. I then proceed to use four case studies to illustrate my causal mechanisms. Using original archival material and interviews with retired Iraqi military personnel, I show how both low literacy and coup proofing undermined Iraq's destructivity relative to the United States. I then examine the British and German cases to answer the question - what happens when two states of equal literacy, with no history of coups, fight one another? I suggest that market structure, by affecting the relative opportunities for military recruits inside and outside the service, is the key factor in providing a marginal advantage to one side relative to the other.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Quick Response is an {{umbrella}} term for strategies to cut lead times and to eliminate unnecessary production costs from a manufacturing plant to a consumer market. In particular, the textile and apparel industries need strategies to quickly {{respond to a}} changeable market in the international supply chain. As the industry performs these strategies, problems can occur which interfere with implementing efficient Quick Response strategies. Until now, the textile and apparel industries have mainly focused on high technological systems to solve the problems; much development of the high technology has been accomplished in the international supply chain. In addition, the industries should {{recognize the importance of}} <b>intangible</b> <b>factors</b> (e. g., communication among sectors) because they might give rise to diverse problems in their supply chain. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate the <b>intangible</b> <b>factors</b> and to research how they have had an influence on Quick Response strategies in the international supply chain. To investigate these factors, the study employed a case study which involved interviews with people who worked for-AGABANG Co. Six individuals in several positions of AGABANG Co. were represented in the interviews; two supervisors who were in charge of brands for Wal-Mart, a designer who developed and made production samples for Wal-Mart, an export staff member who sourced manufacturing systems and controlled manufacturing schedules, a manufacturer who managed manufacturing operations in China, and a subcontractor who provided cloth. Interviewees had working experiences with foreign buyers and manufacturers, and clearly testified to the <b>intangible</b> <b>factors</b> through their cumulated experiences. Through the interviews, this study identified various <b>intangible</b> <b>factors</b> in the international supply chain. In particular, the research found that one of the most critical the factors was pressure from buyers to reduce production costs.

As companies strive to reduce production costs and therefore move facilities building these relationships become challenging. Many textile and apparel companies hope to efficiently run their systems and strategies as they solve these problems. Therefore, the results of this research will be helpful for the textile and apparel companies that want to improve and develop their Quick Response strategies...|$|R
