50|$|If the inputs are bounded-length {{strings and}} each input may {{independently}} occur with uniform probability (such as telephone numbers, car license plates, <b>invoice</b> <b>numbers,</b> etc.), then a hash function needs to map {{roughly the same}} number of inputs to each hash value. For instance, suppose that each input is an integer z in the range 0 to N−1, and the output must be an integer h in the range 0 to n−1, where N is much larger than n. Then the hash function could be h = z mod n (the remainder of z divided by n), or h = (z × n) ÷ N (the value z scaled down by n/N and truncated to an integer), or many other formulas.|$|E
50|$|A vendor {{adds the}} Creditor Reference to its invoices. When a {{customer}} pays the invoice, the company writes the Creditor Reference {{instead of the}} <b>invoice</b> <b>number</b> in the message section, or places a Creditor Reference field in its payment ledger.|$|R

30|$|Figure  1 {{lists the}} order volumes and also {{distribution}} or {{orders from the}} smallest to the largest. The distribution of orders is relatively normal and the orders are divided rather evenly between the smallest and the largest amounts. The distribution is listed according to <b>invoice</b> <b>numbers</b> during 6 / 2009. Fig. 1 addresses that the orders are rather small in tons: {{over half of the}} deliveries are under 5 tons. The smallest orders were only some hundred kilos and the largest were up to 26 tons. The figure reveals an interesting factor about the business and logistics character of a paper mill: a large unit can manufacture about 500, 000 tons of paper annually. If orders are from 2 to 25 tons, on average, around 5 tons, there can be roughly between 20, 000 and 50, 000 annual international deliveries and between 1500 to 4000 monthly deliveries. This addresses the importance of logistics for bulk industry in getting the products to the customers in good shape and in time.|$|E
40|$|For (forensic) {{auditing}} purposes {{it is useful}} to have a wise view of how pro- cesses are performed in an organisation. Workflow mining can help in creating such a view by mining workflow models that give a visual representation of the processes. But not all organisations use workflow management systems that produce the needed event logs that are used as input for the workflow min- ing techniques. What this research is set to accomplish is to design a stepwise approach that extracts these event logs from corporate network data that is available in any organisation To accomplish this the stepwise approach must extract caseIDs, activities and the order in which the activities occur. The fo- cus of the approach is on the process around invoices. The approach that have been designed has four steps. 1. Indexing of the Corporate Network Data 2. Mining the <b>invoice</b> <b>numbers</b> to be used as caseIDs 3. Document discovery of all the documents that are related to the invoice process. 4. Extracting the activities those documents support. The case study shows that the event logs can indeed be created and a work- flow model is mined from those event logs. Thought the validation {{of the quality of the}} mined workflow model is very difficult. The approach does look promising for extracting event logs.

50|$|A {{degenerate}} {{dimension is}} a key, {{such as a}} transaction <b>number,</b> <b>invoice</b> <b>number,</b> ticket number, or bill-of-lading number, that has no attributes and hence does not join to an actual dimension table. Degenerate dimensions are very common when the grain of a fact table represents a single transaction item or line item because the degenerate dimension represents the unique identifier of the parent. Degenerate dimensions often play an integral role in the fact table's primary key.|$|R

50|$|Hahn Air {{was founded}} as a {{domestic}} German airline in 1994.Its home base was the former Hahn US military air base (now Frankfurt-Hahn Airport), from which the company's name originates. In 1997, Hahn Air joined its first Billing and Settlement Plan (BSP) in Germany. The airline has the 2 letter code HR and the <b>invoice</b> <b>number</b> (IATA prefix code) 169. Hahn Air flights have been sold via the Amadeus computer reservation system since 1999.|$|R
50|$|When {{making a}} direct deposit {{by means of}} {{electronic}} funds transfer, the payer would also normally enter reference information to enable the payee to easily recognise who made the deposit and which account to credit. The reference may be an account <b>number,</b> an <b>invoice</b> <b>number,</b> the payer's name, or some other meaningful identification. To ensure that the payee {{is aware of the}} deposit, the payer would commonly follow up by sending to the payee a remittance advice.|$|R
2500|$|Emperor Maximilian. [...] This {{issue was}} lithographed, rather poorly, and issued imperforate. [...] The regency had {{previously}} changed the official currency under which one peso equaled 8 reales to a decimal {{system in which}} one peso equaled 100 centavos. In making the conversion postal rates were rounded up, for example, the rate of one real being equal to 12.5 centavos was rounded up to 13 centavos. [...] The stamps, as a result, were issued in values of 7c, 13c, 25c, and 50c.

50|$|Each {{input card}} was read at two {{successive}} reading stations. Thus, for example, fields in a card {{could be compared}} with the following card and, should a change be detected, say in <b>invoice</b> <b>number,</b> totals could be printed. Unlike earlier IBM tabulating machines, which had 80 read brushes at each read station, one for each column, the 407 had 960 brushes at each station, one for each possible hole in a punched card. Cards were held in position during each read cycle and the per digit pulses needed were generated using commutators, one for each column. This allowed the card to be read more than once at each station, for greater flexibility.|$|R

30|$|The {{feedback}} on the three closed questions (i.e., task difficulty, explicitness, authenticity) was rather neutral. For anchor task (1.1) ‘processing a customer order’, the mean ‘task difficulty’ was 4.3 on a 7 -point scale (SD =  1.4), the mean ‘explicitness’ was 3.5 (SD =  2.0) and the mean ‘authenticity’ was 3.0 (SD =  1.7). In their open feedback, the apprentices stressed {{that it was an}} exciting simulation. However, they also said that they had never performed such tasks before and considered them more branch-specific for industrial companies and unlike a typical duty, for example, in a bank. The apprentices liked the test format, particularly the video prompts. In their opinion, the simulation’s content and visualization were rather appealing and authentic. However, they reported that some tasks were too complex for the beginning stages of apprenticeship training. Furthermore, they indicated that they had little or no understanding of some of the terms (e.g., ‘CW’ 34 and <b>invoice</b> <b>number).</b>|$|R

The aim of this thesis {{is to find the}} factors that affect the time required for the processing of accounting and taxes. Another goal is to create a multidimensional econometric model that meets the assumptions of the classical regression model. The theoretical part focuses on basic obligations in accounting, taxes and wages under the relevant legislation. A method of regression analysis is also introduced. In the practical part the dependence between the number of hours and selected explanatory variables in chosen companies is examined. The result is an econometric model that is 90 % identical to the original data. The final model contains four explanatory variables. This is the <b>number</b> of received <b>invoices,</b> the <b>number</b> of issued <b>invoices,</b> the <b>number</b> of employees and experience of the accountant. The model will be used as a support tool for decision making about the acceptance a new customer into the accounting office...|$|R
