40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The base Al-Zn {{superplastic alloy}} was {{investigated}} at 250 °C {{to determine the}} effect of small amounts of magnesium on mechanical properties. Six alloys of nominal composition 0. 00, 0. 10, 0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75, and 1. 00 weight percent magnesium, constant 78 weight percent zinc, and variable 21 to 22 weight percent aluminum were each tested in tension at strain rates of 0. 02, 0. 20, and 2. 00 in/min to determine the flow stress and elongation at each strain rate for each composition. Superplastic elongation occurred at all three strain rates in the specimens containing no magnesium. The addition of any magnesium content investigated destroyed any significant superplastic deformation and led to <b>intercrystalline</b> <b>fracture</b> of all other test specimens. The intermetallic compound Mg₂Zn₁₁ was uniformly distributed throughout the microstructure, limiting plastic deformation. In general, the flow stress was found to increase to a maximum as the magnesium content was increased up to about 0. 75 percent, then to start dropping off. At the same time, after the initial drop in elongation due to the change from the superplastic to the <b>intercrystalline</b> <b>fracture</b> mode, the trend in elongation was to decrease slowly with increasing magnesium content.

For the maximum (150 min) test duration the weight loss in tap water (no additive) is the smallest. However, {{this is not the}} case for shorter test times. The biggest difference between weight losses among the various solutions is about 10 % - 30 %, which is somewhat beyond natural data scatter for such vibratory tests. Released gases and also particles may play an important role in the results. There are three easily distinguishable damage regions for all cavitated surfaces, i. e. generally undamaged rim, central heavily damaged region and transition region, as for most vibratory tests. The relative areas of the three regions are about 53. 5 %, 0. 13 % and 46. 4 % respectively for the present tests. The erosion rate and extent of the damaged regions do not depend substantially on the solute tested. The very small area of the heavily damaged central region is presumably due to the relatively low horn amplitude used in these tests. The increase in damage rate with respect to tap water is about 50 % for the maximum test duration. Surface photographs and scanning electron microscopy photomicrographs (for a test duration of 150 min) are presented.

40|$|Due to {{the high}} amount of carbon and diffusible hydrogen, {{high-strength}} wear-resistant steel NM 360, which is widely used on excavating machinery, always tends to develop cold crack after welding. Heat affected zone (HAZ) is the weakest part in a welding joint and is the most probable location for the generation of welding cold crack. In this paper, the effects of preheating temperature and heat input on welding cold crack sensitivity of NM 360 steel have been studied by using implant tests. It is found that the preheating temperature and interlayer temperature during CO 2 arc welding of NM 360 steel should be 100 °C or 125 °C {{to prevent the occurrence}} of welding cold crack. The critical rupture stress and rupture time under high stress can be improved significantly with a high enough preheating temperature. However, heat input increase has little effect on critical rupture stress.

This study {{is aimed at}} evaluating the diagenetic history of the Slave Point carbonates, with particular emphasis on dolomitization and porosity evolution. Carbonates of the Slave Point Formation have undergone a complex diagenetic history, represented mainly by cementation and dolomitization. All lithofacies are fractured and variably dolomitized. Dolomitization ranges from isolated fabric-selective dolomite rhombs, through to pervasive dolomitization. Diagenesis occurred during shallow to deep burial, with a proposed interlude of hydrothermal alteration. Four different types of dolomite have been identified: (1) matrix dolomite, (2) pseudomorphic dolomite, (3) pervasive dolomite, and, (4) saddle dolomite.

Although most of {{the oil and gas}} reserves discovered so far are mainly distributed in Mesozoic, Cenozoic, and upper Paleozoic strata, oil and gas exploration in the Proterozoic–Lower Paleozoic (PLP) strata—the oldest marine strata—has been very limited. To more clearly understand the oil and gas formation conditions and distributions in the PLP marine carbonate strata, we analyzed and characterized the petroleum geological conditions, oil and gas reservoir types, and their distributions in thirteen giant oil and gas fields worldwide. This study reveals the main factors controlling their formation and distribution. Our analyses show that the source rocks for these giant oil and gas fields are mainly shale with a great abundance of type I–II organic matter and a high thermal evolution extent. The reservoirs are mainly gas reservoirs, and the reservoir rocks are dominated by dolomite. The reservoir types are mainly karst and reef–shoal bodies with well-developed dissolved pores and cavities, <b>intercrystalline</b> pores, and <b>fractures.</b> These reservoirs are highly heterogeneous. The burial depth of the reservoirs is highly variable and somewhat negatively correlated to the porosity. The cap rocks are mainly thick evaporites and shales, with the thickness of the cap rocks positively correlated to the oil and gas reserves. The development of high-quality evaporite cap rock is highly favorable for oil and gas preservation. We identified four hydrocarbon generation models, and that the major source rocks have undergone a long period of burial and thermal evolution and are characterized by early and long periods of hydrocarbon generation. These giant oil and gas fields have diverse types of reservoirs and are mainly distributed in paleo-uplifts, slope zones, and platform margin reef-shoal bodies. The main factors that control their formation and distribution were identified, enabling the prediction of new favorable areas for oil and gas exploration.|$|R

Microstructures, microhardness, and fractured surfaces were analyzed for three different rpms and mm·min− 1 with Ti- 6242 SG and Ti- 54 M {{kept on the}} advancing and retreating side, respectively. While constant traverse speed (varying rotation speed) has no significant effect on micrographic patterns in weld nugget, constant rotation speed (with increasing traverse speed) results in {{an increasing number of}} streaks with specified spacing (advances per revolution) (consisting of material migrating from retreating side) on the advancing side. Although, hardness variation within streaks (due to lower values of v ω; where v   and   ω are traverse and rotation speed) were challenging to evaluate, yet hardness maps imitated the micrographic morphology of the weld nugget. For varying rotation (225 – 325 rpm) and traverse speed (100 – 150 mm·min− 1), corresponding microstructure evolutions on the advancing and retreating side were related, with variations in evolving temperatures for corresponding welding parameters. Fractured surfaces revealed an appearance of a combination of transcrystalline and <b>intercrystalline</b> <b>fracture</b> for all the processing parameters.

At room temperature 20 °C, during tensile testing at strain rates in the tested region, the strain is first controlled by work hardening, expressed by the exponent n.

There is a marked decrease of plastic properties for the strain rate ε & = 2. 5 · 10 – 5 s– 1 {{with the growth of}} temperature in the investigated region. It is explained by changes in the micromechanism of deformation and fracture.

40|$|The {{limestone}} of Eocene age Laki Formation of Matyaro Jabal area, Lakhi Range SindhPakistan {{has been}} studied to see different sedimentary features and diagenetic overprinting. The most diagnostic diagenetic feature of the Laki Formation is the formation of strata bound dolostone over extensive area. The dolostone beds which are separated by non-dolomitic limestone have developed at three different stratigraphic levels whose thickness vary from few centimeters to about 5 meters. Interbedded non dolomitic limestone is characterized by highly fossiliferous to less fossiliferous white chalky limestone with significant secondary porosity. The dolostone beds make lower erosional contact with chalky limestone while upper contact is sharp as well as transitional. The dolostone beds are very hard to soft with well developed dissolution cavities and karstification horizons. As a result of dolostone formation, the primary sedimentary features of rock fabrics and bioclasts are poorly preserved. However, few bioclastic grains show partial preservation with enhanced dissolution and biomoldic porosity.

These microfacies are dominated by muddy carbonates, such as skeletal mudstones, wackestones, and packstones with dolomites and anhydrite. Rock textures, faunal assemblages and sedimentary structures suggest shallow, clear, warm waters and low to moderate energy conditions within the depositional shelf environment. The Beda Formation represents a shallowing-upward sequence typical of lagoonal and tidal flat environments marked at the top by sabkha and brackish-water sediments. Microfossils include benthonic foraminifera, such as miliolids, Nummulites, - oerculina and other smaller benthonics, in addition to dasycladacean algae, ostracods, molluscs, echinoderms, bryozoans and charophytes. Fecal pellets and pelloids, along with the biotic allochems, contributed greatly to {{the composition of the}} various microfacies. Dolomite, where present, is finely crystalline and an early replacement product. Anhydrite occurs as nodular, chickenwire and massive textures indicating supratidal sabkha deposition. Compaction, micr it i zat ion, dolomit izat ion, recrystallization, cementation, and dissolution resulted in alteration and obliteration of primary sedimentary structures of the Beda Formation microfacies. The study area is located in the Gerad Trough which developed as a NE-SW trending extensional graben. The Gerad trough was characterized by deep-shallow water conditions throughout the deposition of the Beda Formation sediments.

40|$|The {{crack growth}} {{behaviour}} of materials for application in turbines at temperatures of 500 - 750 C has been investigated. The creep and fatigue service loadings {{of a real}} turbine disc were simulated by introducing hold-times. The materials tested were the superalloy PM N 18, Inconel 617 and the intermetallic phase #beta#-NiAl of nominally stoichiometric composition. The crack growth tests were conducted in air and in vacuum (10 "-" 5 mbar) to assess {{the influence of the}} test atmosphere. One of the main objectives was to develop a marker method and its application, as support for the crack growth tests carried out. The width of the marker required for the marker bands could be chosen through the number of stress cycles or the crack growth increment in the marker-cycle. At 500 C, the crack surfaces of the CT specimens of Inconel 617 and PM N 18 exhibited mixed fractures with trans- and intercrystalline regions. The fracture development could be divided into three, classical parts. At his temperature for both alloys the K_I concept for the evaluation of the crack growth may be used. The RCT specimens of the intermetallic phase #beta#-NiAl fractured in a completely brittle manner with no measurable time to failure. At 500 C, Inconel 617 and especially PM N 18 were well suited {{to the use of the}} marker method. Measurements of the distances between the marker bands gave a good estimate of the crack growth rates. At the higher test temperature of 750 C, the crack growth rates and the proportion of <b>intercrystalline</b> <b>fracture</b> increased for Inconel 617 and PM N 18. In all three materials, the formation of pores and dimpled fracture was observed, especially at high #DELTA#K_I values, and the coarse-grained #beta#-NiAl exhibited higher crack growth rates than the fine-grained material. For this temperature the evaluation of the crack growth experiments should be by the K_I concept for PM N 18 and for Inconel 617 the C"* concept is recommended. At the higher test temperature, the increased plasticity of Inconel 617 and #beta#-NiAl made the application of the marker method difficult. The superalloy PM N 18 was well suited to the marker method even at 750 C. An acceleration of the crack growth in air at 500 C compared to that in vacuum was observed only for Inconel 617. At 750 C, both coarse-grained and fine-grained #beta#- NiAl exhibited higher crack growth rates in air than in vacuum. (orig.) Dissertation submitted by Schwarze, D., 170 refs.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 In {{the world}} of joining, {{riveting}} and additive manufacturing, weight reduction, and omission of defects (at both macro and micro level) remain of paramount. Therefore, {{in the wake of}} ubiquitous fusion welding (FW) and widely accepted approach of riveting using Inconel bolts to resist corrosion at higher temperature, friction stir welding (FSW) has emerged as a novice jewel in friction based additive manufacturing industry. With advancements in automation of welding process and tool material, FSW of materials with higher work hardening such as steel and titanium has also become probable. Process and property relations associated with FSW are inevitable in case of dissimilar titanium alloys, due to presence of heterogeneity (whether atrocious or advantageous) in and around the weld nugget. These process property relationships are needed to be studied and addressed properly in order to optimize the processing window for improved mechanical and metallurgical properties. In this study FSWed similar and dissimilar butt joints of α+β, and near α titanium, alloys have been produced for varying processing conditions in order to study the effect of rotation speed (rpm) and traverse speed (TS; mm-min- 1). The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the effect of tool geometry, tool rpm, TS on microstructure and mechanical properties of most widely used α+β titanium alloy, Ti- 6 Al- 4 V (Ti- 64), standard grain and fine grain in addition to α+β,Ti- 5 Al- 4 V (T- 54 M), standard grain, and near α, Ti- 6 Al- 2 Mo- 4 Zr- 2 Sn (Ti- 6242), standard grain (SG) and fine grain (FG). During FSW, a unique α+β fine-grained microstructure has been formed depending on whether or not the peak temperature in the weld nugget (WN) reached above or below β transus temperature. The resulting microstructure consists of acicular α+β, emanating from the prior β grain boundary as the weld cools off. The changes in the microstructure are observed by optical microscopy (OM). Later, a detailed analysis of material flow has been done by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Hardness profiles on the transverse cross section of the weld have been measured in order to relate the deformation of main constituents, α {hexagonal close packed (hcp) }, and β {body centered cubic (bcc) } that provides a new paradigm into grain refinement mechanism. Material flow and evolving microstructure along with distribution of corresponding elements distribution was characterized by SEM, and EDS respectively. For the case of dissimilar alloys (Ti- 6242 & Ti- 54 M, and Ti- 6242 & Ti- 64) a necklace shaped macrostructure has been observed in the WN consisting of untransformed α migrating from the side of Ti- 6242, and of basket-weave morphology (prior β grains transforming into α+β decorated with grain boundary α) of Ti- 54 M. Microhardness characterization undoubtedly reveals distinct boundaries between weld nugget and parent material. However, to understand the constitutive behavior of the thermo mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) on the advancing side (ADV), or retreating side (RET) and of WN, digital image correlation (DIC) technique has been adapted to develop strain maps in transverse tensile specimens. Improved mechanical properties of TMAZ on the ADV in comparison with RET TMAZ are in accordance with hardness values. Occurrence of fracture on the RET side, and morphology of the fractured surface have also been discussed. Based on the fractured morphology, it can be said that the presence of distinct and clustered island like morphologies in the form of transcrystalline and <b>intercrystalline</b> <b>fracture</b> is a results of microstructure that evolves due to difference in β transus temperature of two alloys. The mechanical properties are analyzed and discussed in that regard. Evolving volume fraction of phases along with their crystallographic orientation has also been elucidated. Evolution of texture has been discussed in terms of (100) _α,(002) _α,(110) _β,(101) _α and (102) _α. Main constituents of texture in friction stir welded dissimilar titanium alloys, (101) _α and (002) _α have been discussed for their strength and orientation at various rotation speed. It has been highlighted that for the FSW of dissimilar titanium alloys (near α,and α+β), center of the WN is stronger in texture in comparison with RET and ADV side. Furthermore, state-of-the-art FSW technique has been used to weld dissimilar titanium alloys for post weld heat treatment (PWHT) studies at 933 °C for 45 minutes. The processing parameters for welding are 225 rpm, and 125 mm-min- 1. In light of recent PWHT, conducted for FSWed Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, in order to achieve super plasticity, our study focuses on dissimilar titanium alloys, Ti- 54 M, and Ti- 6242 FG. A proper understanding of underlying material flow during FSW of dissimilar titanium alloys is essential in designing a monolithic structure operating under varying thermal and mechanical loading. Higher fraction of α with no pre-defined prior β grain boundaries has been observed in PWHTed condition. Uniform, rather lower values of hardness have been achieved in the PWHTed specimen. Furthermore, Spatial arrangement, whether on ADV or RET, can significantly affect the evolution of microstructure, and congruent mechanical properties. In this study, Ti- 54 M and Ti- 6242 FG have been joined by FSW with Ti- 6242 FG being on ADV side. X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique has been utilized for phase evaluation, pole figure analysis, and residual stress measurements. Finally, a wide range of weld surfaces, macrostructures, microstructures, microhardness profiles, phase evolution, pole figures, full field strain maps, material flow patterns, fractographs and development of residual stresses has been presented in corresponding appendices. The morphology of the fractured surfaces along with the residual stress distribution, rendered by different rpm and TS employed on different combination of similar and dissimilar joints of titanium alloys, provided an insight to correlate the material flow, hardness distributions, tensile properties; yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and percentage elongation (% Elong.) ...|$|E
