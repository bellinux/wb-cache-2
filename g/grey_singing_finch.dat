5000|$|There are two {{music videos}} for [...] "Room for Happiness"; both were {{uploaded}} to YouTube by the Ultra Records channel on February 24, 2012. [...] The first video, subtitled [...] "Fire" [...] (as {{it is the}} version from the Fire disc of the album), features both Kaskade and, primarily, Skylar Grey. Kaskade is seen either DJing or watching Skylar Grey in a virtual-reality type room with a bed (alluding to the single's cover art) that he controls. <b>Grey</b> is seen <b>singing</b> in the room while it changes scenery. The scenery changes between a dark forest, a room of fire and a sunny desert (after the room walls break down). The second video, for Kaskade's ICE Mix of the song, has a few differences. This version is over a minute longer and opens with Grey {{lying on the bed}} of the room while in the scenery of a burnt-down forest (not seen in the [...] "Fire" [...] video), and Kaskade opens in a different room instead of a hallway. Other things not seen in the [...] "Fire" [...] video are Grey laying her head {{on the rim of the}} bed (also alluding to the single's cover art) and singing to the camera knowing Kaskade is watching. The video for [...] "Kaskade's ICE Mix", although, does not have the scenes of Kaskade DJing, the room of fire or <b>Grey</b> <b>singing</b> in the sunny desert room (because the [...] "walls" [...] break down at the end of the video instead of the middle).|$|R

40|$|SummarySimilarities between {{speech and}} birdsong make songbirds {{advantageous}} for investigating the neurogenetics of learned vocal communication—a complex phenotype probably supported by ensembles of interacting genes in cortico-basal ganglia pathways of both species. To date, only FoxP 2 {{has been identified}} as critical to both speech and birdsong. We performed weighted gene coexpression network analysis on microarray data from <b>singing</b> zebra <b>finches</b> to discover gene ensembles regulated during vocal behavior. We found ∼ 2, 000 singing-regulated genes comprising three coexpression groups unique to area X, the basal ganglia subregion dedicated to learned vocalizations. These contained known targets of human FOXP 2 and potential avian targets. We validated biological pathways not previously implicated in vocalization. Higher-order gene coexpression patterns, rather than expression levels, molecularly distinguish area X from the ventral striato-pallidum during singing. The previously unknown structure of singing-driven networks enables prioritization of molecular interactors that probably bear on human motor disorders, especially those affecting speech...|$|R
40|$|Background: Birdsong {{and human}} vocal {{communication}} are both complex behaviours which show striking similarities mainly {{thought to be}} present in the area of development and learning. Recent studies, however, suggest that there are also parallels in vocal production mechanisms. While it has been long thought that vocal tract filtering, as it occurs in human speech, only plays a minor role in birdsong there is an increasing number of studies indicating the presence of sound filtering mechanisms in bird vocalizations as well. Methodology/Principal Findings: Correlating high-speed X-ray cinematographic imaging of <b>singing</b> zebra <b>finches</b> (Taeniopygia guttata) to song structures we identified beak gape and the expansion of the oropharyngeal-esophageal cavity (OEC) as potential articulators. We subsequently manipulated both structures in an experiment in which we played sound through the vocal tract of dead birds. Comparing acoustic input with acoustic output showed that OEC expansion causes an energy shift towards lower frequencies and an amplitude increase whereas a wide beak gape emphasizes frequencies around 5 kilohertz and above. Conclusion: These findings confirm that birds can modulate their song by using vocal tract filtering and demonstrate ho...|$|R
40|$|Roadside {{habitats}} {{are important}} {{for a range of}} taxa including plants, insects, mammals, and birds, particularly in developed countries in which large expanses of native vegetation have been cleared for agriculture or urban development. Although roadside vegetation may provide suitable habitat for many species, resident animals can be exposed to high levels of traffic noise, visual disturbance from passing vehicles, and the risk of collision with cars and trucks. Traffic noise can reduce the distance over which acoustic signals such as song can be detected, an effect known as acoustic interference or masking. Studies from the northern hemisphere show that the singing behavior of birds changes in the presence of traffic noise. We investigated the impact of traffic noise and traffic volume on two species of birds, the Grey Shrike-thrush (Colluricincla harmonica) and the Grey Fantail (Rhipidura fuliginosa), at 58 roadside sites on the Mornington Peninsula, southeastern Australia. The lower <b>singing</b> <b>Grey</b> Shrike-thrush <b>sang</b> at a higher frequency in the presence of traffic noise, with a predicted increase in dominant frequency of 5. 8 Hz/dB of traffic noise, and a total effect size of 209 Hz. In contrast, the higher <b>singing</b> <b>Grey</b> Fantail did not appear to change its song in traffic noise. The probability of detecting each species on a visit to a site declined substantially with increasing traffic noise and traffic volume, with several lines of evidence supporting a larger effect of traffic noise. Traffic noise could hamper detection of song by conspecifics, making it more difficult for birds to establish and maintain territories, attract mates and maintain pair bonds, and possibly leading to reduced breeding success in noisy roadside habitats. Closing key roads during the breeding season is a potential, but untested, management strategy to protect threatened bird species from traffic noise and collision with vehicles at {{the time of year when}} they are most vulnerable to their impacts. Other management options include reducing the speed and/or volume of traffic on such roads to an acceptably low level. Ours is the first study to investigate the effect of traffic noise on the singing behavior of birds in the southern hemisphere...|$|R

40|$|Zebra finches {{memorize}} a tutor song as juveniles, {{and then}} faithfully reproduce this {{song for the}} remainder of their lives. This thesis investigates how the intricate and concerted activity of ensembles of neurons in the zebra finch brain gives rise to this complex behavior. The first section of the thesis demonstrates how neurons in RA, a pre-motor song control nucleus, coordinate their activity to generate the instantaneous spectral and temporal structure seen in the song. Similar sounds are produced by entirely different ensembles of RA neurons. Additionally, rapidly changing patterns of RA neural activity are capable of generating constant acoustic outputs. This is a new form of neural coding, previously unobserved in any other system. This unusual neural representation provides a concise account of an unexplained aspect of song learning. The second part of the thesis develops a new, noninvasive method of altering the auditory feedback heard by <b>singing</b> zebra <b>finches.</b> This type of feedback perturbation causes the normally stable songs of adult birds to deteriorate, indicating that auditory feedback is essential to song control throughout life. Restoration of the normal auditory feedback hear...|$|R
40|$|In songbirds, the {{remarkable}} temporal precision of song {{is generated by}} a sparse sequence of bursts in the premotor nucleus HVC. To distinguish between two possible classes of models of neural sequence generation, we carried out intracellular recordings of HVC neurons in <b>singing</b> zebra <b>finches</b> (Taeniopygia guttata). We found that the subthreshold membrane potential {{is characterized by a}} large, rapid depolarization 5 – 10 ms before burst onset, consistent with a synaptically connected chain of neurons in HVC. We found no evidence for the slow membrane potential modulation predicted by models in which burst timing is controlled by subthreshold dynamics. Furthermore, bursts ride on an underlying depolarization of ~ 10 -ms duration, probably the result of a regenerative calcium spike within HVC neurons that could facilitate the propagation of activity through a chain network with high temporal precision. Our results provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms by which neural circuits can generate complex sequential behaviours. National Institutes of Health (U. S.)

40|$|Humans and songbirds {{are among}} the rare animal groups that exhibit {{socially}} learned vocalizations: speech and song, respectively. These vocal-learning capacities share a reliance on audition and cortico-basal ganglia circuitry, as well as neurogenetic mechanisms. Notably, the transcription factors Forkhead box proteins 1 and 2 (FoxP 1, FoxP 2) exhibit similar expression patterns in the cortex and basal ganglia of humans and the zebra finch species of songbird, among other brain regions. Mutations in either gene are associated with language disorders in humans. Experimental knock-down of FoxP 2 in the basal ganglia song control region Area X during song development leads to imprecise copying of tutor songs. Moreover, FoxP 2 levels decrease naturally within Area X when zebra <b>finches</b> <b>sing.</b> Here, we examined neural expression patterns of FoxP 1 and FoxP 2 mRNA in adult Bengalese finches, a songbird species whose songs exhibit greater sequence complexity and increased reliance on audition for maintaining their quality. We found that FoxP 1 and FoxP 2 expression in Bengalese finches {{is similar to that}} in zebra finches, including strong mRNA signals for both factors in multiple song control nuclei and enhancement of FoxP 1 in these regions relative to surrounding brain tissue. As with zebra finches, when Bengalese <b>finches</b> <b>sing,</b> FoxP 2 is behaviorally downregulated within basal ganglia Area X over a similar time course, and expression negatively correlates with the amount of singing. This study confirms that in multiple songbird species, FoxP 1 expression highlights song control regions, and regulation of FoxP 2 is associated with motor control of song. © 2013 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd...|$|R
