25|$|By radiographic, i.e. X-Ray, methods, after arteries have {{developed}} advanced calcified atherosclerotic plaque, IMT {{can also be}} semi-estimated by {{the distance between the}} outer edges of calcification (actually this leaves out most of the media) and the outer edges of an angiographic dye column within the artery lumen.

25|$|The {{mechanism}} for inflation is unclear, it {{is similar in}} effect to dark energy but <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> more energetic and short lived process. As with dark energy the best explanation is some form of vacuum energy arising from quantum fluctuations. It may be that inflation caused baryogenesis, the hypothetical physical processes that produced an asymmetry (imbalance) between baryons and antibaryons produced {{in the very early}} universe, but this is far from certain.|$|E

The sports novel Amazons, a mock memoir of {{the first woman to}} play in the National Hockey League, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> more lighthearted and more evidently commercial novel than his previous and subsequent novels. DeLillo published the novel under the pseudonym Cleo Birdwell, and later requested publishers compiling a bibliography for a reprint of a later novel to expunge the novel from their lists.|$|E

25|$|In adulthood, {{individuals}} do not experience male-pattern baldness. As DHT <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> more potent androgen than testosterone alone, virilization in those lacking DHT may be absent or reduced compared to males with functional 5-AR. It is hypothesized that rising testosterone levels {{at the start}} of puberty are able to generate sufficient levels of DHT either by the action of 5α-reductase type I (active in the adult liver, non-genital skin and some brain areas) or through the expression of low levels of 5α-reductase type II in the testes.|$|E

Why should I join a synagogue? Why should I support Israel? Why should I be Jewish?' We have relied on a singular imperative: 'Thou shalt not give Hitler a posthumous victory.'

25|$|Most {{recreational}} and professional diver training organisations would consider relying on buddy breathing {{from a single}} regulator as an unacceptable risk, {{as the use of}} a secondary demand valve (octopus) or second regulator, either from an alternative scuba cylinder, or from the primary scuba set, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> more reliable and safe method of supplying emergency air to a diver who is part of a planned team or buddy dive, and a solo diver should carry his/her own emergency gas supply. There should never be a situation on a well planned and executed dive where two divers need to share a single demand valve, but the technique is still considered useful by some diving schools as it teaches control and hones skills under difficult circumstances.|$|E

25|$|The {{view that}} occlusal trauma (as may occur during bruxism) is a causative factor in {{gingivitis}} and periodontitis is not widely accepted. It {{is thought that}} the periodontal ligament may respond to increased occlusal (biting) forces by resorbing some of the bone of the alveolar crest, which may result in increased tooth mobility, however these changes are reversible if the occlusal force is reduced. Tooth movement that occurs during occlusal loading is sometimes termed fremitus. It is generally accepted that increased occlusal forces are able to increase the rate of progression of pre-existing periodontal disease (gum disease), however the main stay treatment is plaque control rather than elaborate occlusal adjustments. It is also generally accepted that periodontal disease <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> more common cause of tooth mobility and pathological tooth migration than any influence of bruxism, although bruxism may much less commonly be involved in both.|$|E
25|$|Two {{forms of}} feline {{coronavirus}} {{are found in}} nature: enteric (FECV) and FIP (FIPV). There are also two different serotypes found with different antigens that produce unique antibodies. FCoV serotype I (also called type I) is the most frequent. Type I, that {{can be defined as}} 'FECV that could mutate to FIPV type I', is responsible for 80% of the infections. Typically, serotype I FCoV cultures are difficult to perform, with few resulting studies. FCoV serotype II (also called type II) is less frequent and is described as 'FECV type II that can mutate to FIPV type II.' FCoV type II is a recombinant virus type I with spike genes (S protein) replacement from FCoV by the canine enteric coronavirus (CCOV) spikes. The type II cultures are generally easier to perform, which has resulted in an imbalance of experiments performed with many studies about type II (even though it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> less common form).|$|E
25|$|The {{differences}} between these two copies are ample testament to the distances {{in time and space}} that separate them. Several are relatively superficial, representing different conventions for the spelling of what was in fact the same sound: eg. Leiden's typically early ⟨u⟩, ⟨th⟩ and ⟨b⟩, frequently appearing for Exeter ⟨w⟩ (the Anglo-Saxon letter 'wynn'), ⟨þ⟩ and ⟨f⟩. Reflecting a distinct pronunciation are the Leiden forms ueta (1), herum (4) and auefun (9), whose ⟨e⟩ versus Exeter ⟨æ⟩ represents {{one of the most important}} dialect divisions between West Saxon and Anglian; similarly significant are the vowels in, e.g., Leiden heh (4) rather than heah, uarp (5) as opposed to wearp, biað (5) next to beoð, and so on. In general, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> greater range of unaccented vowels in Leiden, another feature of an early date (before these merged; compare, e.g., innaðae (2) with innaðe, hlimmith (6) with hlimmeð); and some important differences in inflexional endings (viz. Leiden's early preterite plural auefun (9), Exeter's late awæfan).|$|E
