5|$|Campbell Playhouse (CBS Radio, March 31, 1939). Directed and {{introduced}} by Orson Welles. This was a non-musical {{version of the}} story that was based more closely on Edna Ferber's novel than on the musical. From the original stage cast Helen Morgan repeated her portrayal of Julie, here singing one song not from the musical. Welles portrayed Cap'n Andy, Margaret Sullavan was Magnolia, and author Edna Ferber made her acting debut as Parthy. This version made Julie into an <b>illegal</b> <b>alien</b> who must be deported.|$|E

500|$|As Fisher was {{no longer}} {{considered}} an alleged <b>illegal</b> <b>alien,</b> but rather an alleged spy, he was flown from Texas to New York on August 7, 1957, to answer the indictment. Fisher was subsequently indicted to stand trial as a Russian spy. The Brooklyn Bar Association approached several prominent trial lawyers with political ambitions, all of whom declined the case. They then contacted James B. Donovan. Because he {{had served as a}} wartime counsel in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and had years of courtroom experience, the Bar Association believed Donovan was uniquely qualified to act as Fisher's defense lawyer. At Donovan's initial meeting with Fisher, the latter accepted Donovan as his defense counsel. Donovan subsequently brought in attorney Thomas M. Debevoise to assist him; Fisher was tried in Federal Court at New York City during October 1957, on three counts: ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2001, D.C. {{police and}} federal {{prosecutors}} were {{contacted by the}} lawyer of an informant, held in a D.C. jail, {{who claimed to have}} knowledge of Levy's killer. The informant, whose identity was protected for his safety, said that Ingmar Guandique, a 20-year-old <b>illegal</b> <b>alien</b> from El Salvador also being held in the jail, told him that Condit paid him $25,000 to kill Levy. Investigators ruled out the story about Condit, because Guandique had already admitted to assaulting two other women in the same park where Levy's remains were found. Guandique failed to show up for work on the day of Levy's disappearance. His former landlady recalled that his face appeared scratched and bruised at around that time. The investigators on the Levy case did not interview the other Rock Creek Park victims. Police chief Ramsey avoided calling Guandique a suspect and described him as a [...] "person of interest", telling reporters not to make [...] "too big a deal" [...] about him. Assistant chief Terrance W. Gainer said that if Guandique had been considered a suspect, D.C. police would have been after him [...] "like flies on honey".|$|E
500|$|Ramírez {{earned a}} save on April 6, , by {{pitching}} [...] of an inning {{to escape a}} bases-loaded situation in the Giants' 84 win over the Padres.

He allowed a season-high four runs in [...] innings and took the loss on June 30 in an 11-inning, 52 defeat to the Cubs. On August 5, in an eventual 92 loss to Philadelphia, Ramírez hit Shane Victorino with a pitch, and a brawl started. Ramírez was subsequently ejected from the game. Afterwards, Philadelphia talk-show host Tony Bruno sparked controversy by posting on his Twitter account that Ramírez was an <b>illegal</b> <b>alien,</b> although he later removed the post. On September 4, Ramírez struck out four batters but gave up a run in [...] innings in a 41 loss to the Diamondbacks. Two days later, he got his final save {{of the year when}} he threw a scoreless [...] of an inning in a 64 victory over San Diego. In 66 games that season, Ramírez had a 33 record, a 2.62 ERA, four saves, 66 strikeouts, and [...] innings pitched.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court's 1982 Plyler v. Doe decision—in a case {{involving}} <b>illegal</b> <b>alien</b> children (i.e., children born abroad {{who had come to}} the United States illegally along with their parents, and who had no basis for claiming U.S. citizenship)—has also been cited in support of a broad application of Fourteenth Amendment jurisdiction to illegal aliens and their children. [...] A Texas state law had sought to deny such children a public education, and the Texas government had argued that [...] "persons who have entered the United States illegally are not 'within the jurisdiction' of a State even if they are present within a State's boundaries and subject to its laws." [...] A 5–4 majority of the Supreme Court, though, decided that according to Wong Kim Ark, the Fourteenth Amendment's phrases subject to the jurisdiction thereof (in the Citizenship Clause) and within its jurisdiction (in the Equal Protection Clause) were essentially equivalent; that both expressions referred primarily to physical presence and not to political allegiance; [...] and that the Wong Kim Ark decision benefited the children of illegal as well as legal aliens. [...] As a result, the court rejected the claim that Fourteenth Amendment [...] "jurisdiction" [...] depended on whether someone had entered the U.S. legally or not. [...] Although the four dissenting justices disagreed with the opinion of the Court regarding whether the children in question had a right to a public education, the dissenters agreed with the majority regarding the applicability of Fourteenth Amendment jurisdiction to illegal aliens. [...] James Ho considers Plyer v. Doe to have [...] "put to rest" [...] any doubt over whether the sweeping language regarding jurisdiction in Wong Kim Ark applies to all aliens, even illegal aliens.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} <b>illegal</b> <b>aliens</b> in Sweden and the Netherlands {{with the main}} focus on health aspects. The {{three-fold}} aim is to investigate emergence of healthcare wants among <b>illegal</b> <b>aliens,</b> how they satisfy these wants (if they do so at all), and to explore the relation between their healthcare wants and health wants. Extensive fieldwork was conducted in both countries, including 42 interviews with <b>illegal</b> <b>aliens</b> in Sweden – and 38 in the Netherlands. In Sweden, except for a trivial exception, there are no state provisions on subsidized healthcare services to <b>illegal</b> <b>aliens</b> - while in the Netherlands, there is a state fund enabling a reimbursement for certain healthcare providers offering "medically necessary care" to this group. Subsidized care services are not restricted to a state. Activities of six private voluntary health-care initiatives (PVHIs) providing care to <b>illegal</b> <b>aliens</b> were also documented. Access to (subsidized) care actively promoted by the human rights framework (as operationalized by the UN Special Rapporteur on the Highest Attainable Standard of Health) and by the medical establishment, showed to be not necessarily sufficient in either addressing or satisfying health (care) wants of <b>illegal</b> <b>aliens.</b> More consistency is desired from different stakeholders working in this subject...|$|R
50|$|Employer {{sanctions}} {{never became}} the effective tool {{it was expected}} to be by Congress. Illegal immigration continued to swell after the 1986 amnesty despite employer sanctions. By 1993, Californians passed Proposition 187, denying benefits to <b>illegal</b> <b>aliens</b> and criminalizing <b>illegal</b> <b>aliens</b> in possession of forged green cards, identification cards, and Social Security numbers. It also authorized police officers to question non-nationals as to their immigration status and required police and sheriff departments to cooperate and report <b>illegal</b> <b>aliens</b> to the INS. Proposition 187 drew nationwide attention to illegal immigration.|$|R
