5|$|Following his conviction, Brady {{was moved}} to Durham Prison, where he asked to live in solitary confinement. He spent 19 years in {{mainstream}} prisons before being diagnosed as a psychopath in November 1985 {{and sent to the}} high-security Park Lane Hospital, now Ashworth Psychiatric Hospital, in Sefton; {{he made it clear that}} <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be released.|$|E

They prevent her from doing so, and Fiore confesses that he, Felder and Barbala had stolen a large sum of money, {{intending}} to keep it safe for ten years before claiming it. Morris learned of their plan and threatened to report on them, and was consequently killed to silence him. However, Fiore maintains that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see Morris dead and only wanted {{to take care of}} Anita after his death. Michelle uses her powers to destroy the fish-tank, but spares Fiore after hearing pleas from Anita not to hurt him. Later, Fiore pleads guilty to charges of murder and grand larceny, whilst Michelle seemingly recovers and goes on to become a normal little girl.|$|E

An angry Brian agrees to get an apartment with Jillian. Much to his surprise, Brian has a good time living with Jillian, but he comes to the realization {{that there is no way}} he can pay the rent by himself and he decides to allow Stewie to move in with them, who now makes money with his own paper route. When Brian does not tell Jillian that Stewie is helping with the rent, Stewie quickly gets in the way of Brian and Jillian's happiness living together.

After many failed attempts to lift a saddened Brian's spirits, Stewie convinces Brian to try to get Jillian back. Brian goes to her apartment, only to find that she has now moved in with Mayor West.

25|$|With Chelsea in {{the market}} for a midfielder {{following}} a long-term injury to Michael Essien, and an unsuccessful bid to acquire Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur, the former signed Meireles to a four-year deal on 31 August 2011, for an undisclosed fee reported to be in the region of £12 million. He chose the squad number 16, due to the fact he often wore it when on international duty, and later claimed <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> leave Liverpool but that the chance to work with André Villas-Boas, with whom he had spent a short period of time at Porto, was too good an opportunity to turn down.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{graduating from}} the university, Sakuraba had {{initially}} thought to remain with Chuo University as a coach. However, {{at the last minute}} he decided to pursue a career as a professional wrestler. According to Sakuraba, the impetus for this stemmed from a childhood dream of one day emulating Satoru Sayama, a professional wrestler who portrayed in real life the famous Japanese cartoon hero Tiger Mask. He also stated in an interview with Scramble TV that as an amateur wrestler, he weighed 68 kilograms (about 150 pounds.) He was encouraged by his peers to gain weight as {{it would be difficult to}} compete as a smaller fighter in 'puroresu', and after working to gain the weight needed to compete, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> lose it anymore, something that would be reflected in his MMA career.|$|E
25|$|By 1998, Lawler rarely {{wrestled}} in the WWF {{and focused}} on commentary. Despite their feud in the USWA in 1993, by 1998, Vince McMahon had turned heel in the WWF {{for the first time}} and left the announce position, to which Lawler began praising McMahon's name on commentary as part of his own heel persona, much to the chagrin of Jim Ross. It was McMahon's departure from the commentary team which led to the strong on-screen chemistry between Lawler and Ross in subsequent years. This played a key role in a change of Lawler's character; although he still supported the heels, he showed a sense of right and wrong, and would condemn actions of heels when they went too far. He would become a full-time face by 2007. This began when Lawler surprisingly attacked Tazz when he started bullying Ross. At SummerSlam, The King wrestled Tazz in defense of Ross. With the creation of the XFL in 2001, Lawler was given the job as an announcer for the new football league. Lawler claims that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> announce for the XFL (he would admit on-air that he knew and cared almost nothing about the sport), but that he agreed to it after McMahon and Kevin Dunn asked him.|$|E

500|$|Collins {{became public}} {{property}} {{for a long}} while after the match, forever associated with his great score. [...] "Today all men speak of him," [...] wrote one newspaper, [...] "… he has a reputation as great as the most advertised soap: he will be immortalised." [...] After leaving school, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be reminded of his famous innings; nevertheless, he has been remembered well beyond his own lifetime.|$|E
500|$|Alonso {{completed}} his £30million move to Real Madrid on 5 August 2009. It {{has been suggested}} that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> leave the Anfield side, with his contract existing until at least 2012, and that his departure was due to differences with Benítez. Former teammate Steven Gerrard said he was [...] "devastated" [...] by Alonso's decision, and cited his departure as one of the reasons behind Liverpool's poor run of form {{at the start of the}} following season.|$|E
500|$|Several {{commentators}} have rated Kelly the best accompanist in jazz, including critic Ray Comiskey and music educator Mark Levine. Drummer Philly Joe Jones said that, as an accompanist, Kelly [...] "puts down flowers behind a soloist. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> steal in. He just {{put together the}} right things." [...] Pianist Bruce Barth pointed out that part of Kelly's success as an accompanist came from [...] "occasional and compelling use of 'blues licks' and melodic phrases in place of chords." ...|$|E
50|$|Rusty {{is back on}} {{the beach}} with Steve, five years later. Steve asks him if he ever went back home after his brother’s death. Rusty says no. Steve invites him out for dinner and tells him where to meet later.

500|$|Sellers's {{behaviour}} {{towards his}} family worsened in 1962; {{according to his}} son Michael, Sellers asked him and his sister Sarah [...] "who we love more, our mother or him. Sarah, to keep the peace, said, 'I love you both equally'. I said, 'No, I love my mum.'" [...] This prompted Sellers to throw both children out, saying that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see them again. At the end of 1962, his marriage to Anne broke down. In 1963, Sellers starred as gang leader [...] "Pearly Gates" [...] in Cliff Owen's The Wrong Arm of the Law, followed by his portrayal of a vicar in Heavens Above! ...|$|E
500|$|Many of his English contemporaries rated Hobbs {{superior}} to Donald Bradman, often {{regarded as the}} greatest batsman {{in the history of}} cricket, on difficult pitches. In difficult batting conditions Hobbs batted with great success, and several of his most highly regarded innings came in such circumstances. Murphy suggests: [...] "Before Bradman, he was the most consistent run-getter of all time, yet no one worried less about the sheer slog of carving out big scores." [...] Hobbs frequently was out deliberately soon after reaching a century—roughly a quarter of his centuries were scores less than 110—and was not particularly interested in most statistics. An article in Wisden in 2000 stated: [...] "He was never as dominant as Bradman; <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be. But his contemporaries were in awe of his ability to play supremely and at whim, whatever the conditions." ...|$|E
500|$|During the match, to the {{surprise}} of the public, the press and his teammates, Ponsford announced his retirement from first-class cricket at the relatively young age of 34. His announcement remarked upon the changing atmosphere in high level cricket and touched on the effects of Bodyline. [...] Woodfull remarked that Ponsford's retirement was premature, while teammate and journalist Jack Fingleton believed that the task of maintaining such high standards had affected Ponsford's nervous energy: [...] "At the age of 34 he felt that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see a bat or a cricket game again." [...] Arthur Mailey suspected that Ponsford's sensitivity to criticism, especially from the media, was a key factor behind the early retirement. The memory of being omitted from the Australian side twice during the Bodyline series also stung Ponsford sorely. Ponsford continued playing for the Melbourne Cricket Club until 1939, but never represented his state or country again.|$|E
5000|$|Monkey Punch, the {{original}} creator of Lupin III, {{was the director}} of the film. However, he claims it was not something he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do. The production had a short deadline and as there was no director, he accepted the role. He said the experience was too demanding and claimed that it was the other people involved that [...] "saved" [...] the film, and added that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> direct again.|$|R
50|$|The next day, Lori {{notices that}} Josh is hungover, and the {{incident}} helps Josh <b>to</b> realize <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> drink again.

Hilary begins spreading rumors about Kyle, while a rumor that Declan had a date put Lori on edge.|$|R
5|$|Those {{lyrics are}} crazy. I {{listen to that}} like, 'What was she doing?' Pharrell's just so creative, I {{remember}} back then, and he's always kind of been the same. He's always so positive and so sure and <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> repeat himself. Like, 'How can I make something different and new and not like anything else?' I look back at that whole record, and I think, 'Wow I wish there was more time to do more singles.' You only get {{so many things that}} people hear.|$|R
500|$|Cho {{attended}} the Poplar Tree Elementary School in Chantilly, an unincorporated, small community in Virginia's Fairfax County. According to Kim Gyeong-won, who met Cho {{in the fifth}} grade and took classes with him, Cho finished the three-year program at Poplar Tree Elementary School in one and a half years. Cho was noted for being good at mathematics and English, and teachers pointed to him as an example for other students. At that time, according to Kim, nobody disliked Cho and he [...] "was recognized by friends as a boy of knowledge;... a good dresser who was popular with the girls." [...] Kim added that [...] "I only have good memories about him." [...] An acquaintance noted that [...] "Every time he came home from school he would cry and throw tantrums saying <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> return to school" [...] when Cho first came to the U.S. in about the second grade.|$|E

[...] He allowed his younger brother Shuhei to beat him when they fought for {{the leadership of the}} Kitsune Clan, because <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> fight his best friend. [...] He is in love with a human girl named Renko. [...] He and Shuhei have an older brother who is not mentioned by name, nor appears in the manga. [...] After Kyo kills Shuhei, he becomes the head of the Kitsune Clan. [...] Eventually, he is forced to challenge Kyo for Misao, but loses. [...] However, he is allowed to live.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, Carpenter {{decided that the}} Phillies needed a new home. [...] As {{mentioned}} above, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> buy Connie Mack Stadium in the first place, and was now convinced {{there was no way}} he could make money playing there. [...] The stadium didn't have nearly enough parking, and the neighborhood around it had already gone to seed. [...] To that end, he sold the park to Philadelphia Eagles owner Jerry Wolman in 1964, taking a million-dollar loss on his purchase of just 10 years earlier. [...] The Phillies remained at the old stadium until 1970. [...] In the last game played there, the Phillies avoided last place by beating the Expos 2–1.|$|E
50|$|The book {{starts with}} Illidan being {{released}} from his 10,000-year captivity by Tyrande and his first encounter with Malfurion since he was sealed away. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be imprisoned again. The book travels into the future, specifically the point where Illidan defeats Magtheridon and is ordered to destroy the Frozen Throne, where Ner'zhul, the current Lich King, and Arthas, the next one defeat him. Afterwards, the story skips ahead again to about six months before he is slain by the WoW player characters.|$|R

2500|$|Having {{been given}} {{permission}} {{to create his}} own gang, Kamo would test all of his new members {{to make sure that}} they were up to the task. [...] Kamo would test his new recruits by taking the new recruits to a forest clearing and have them be attacked by fake White army members, bound to a tree, and then put through a fake execution to test their courage. Kamo said that with this test [...] "you could be absolutely sure [...] wouldn't let you down." [...] On one occasion, a recruit revealed himself to be a spy when tested by Kamo; he was shot on the spot. Kamo then cut open the man's chest and tore out the man's heart showing it to the other recruits. When Lenin heard about Kamo's test, he was so disturbed that he sent a message stating that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see him again.|$|E
2500|$|Capitalizing on {{the success}} of the 1950s big-money quiz The $64,000 Question on CBS, Barry and Enright {{developed}} their flagship show, Twenty One, a quiz which had a scoring system based loosely on Blackjack. Contestants were placed in twin isolation booths and asked questions ranging in value from one to 11 points — the higher the point value, the more difficult the question. Enright described the initial broadcast of Twenty One as [...] "a dismal failure. It was just plain dull." [...] Contestants repeatedly missed questions and, in Enright's own words, [...] "It lacked all drama; it lacked all suspense. The next morning the sponsor (Geritol) called my partner, Jack Barry, and me and told us in no uncertain terms that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see a repeat of what happened the previous night. And from that moment on, we decided to rig Twenty One." [...] Even with rigging, initial ratings were unimpressive.|$|E
2500|$|In November and December 1943, while Easy Company was at Aldbourne, {{the tension}} that had been brewing between Winters and Sobel came to a head. For some time, Winters had privately held {{concerns}} over Sobel's ability to lead the company in combat. Many of the enlisted men in the company had come to respect Winters for his competence and had also developed their own concerns about Sobel's leadership. Winters later said that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> compete with Sobel for command of Easy Company; still, Sobel attempted to bring Winters up on trumped-up charges for [...] "failure {{to carry out a}} lawful order". Feeling that his punishment was unjust and sensing Sobel's tacticality of the matter, Winters requested that the charge be reviewed by court-martial. After Winters' punishment was set aside by the battalion commander, Major Robert L. Strayer, Sobel brought Winters up on another charge the following day. During the investigation, Winters was transferred to the Headquarters Company and appointed as the battalion mess officer.|$|E
