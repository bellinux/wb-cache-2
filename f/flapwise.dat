50|$|An {{important}} goal of larger blade systems is to control blade weight. Since blade mass scales as the cube of the turbine radius, loading {{due to gravity}} constrains systems with larger blades. Gravitational loads include axial and tensile/ compressive loads (top/bottom of rotation) as well as bending (lateral positions). The magnitude of these loads fluctuates cyclically and the edgewise moments (see below) are reversed every 180° of rotation.Typical rotor speeds and design life are ~10rpm and 20 years, respectively, {{with the number of}} lifetime revolutions on the order of 10^8. Considering wind, it is expected that turbine blades go through ~10^9 loading cycles.Wind is another source of rotor blade loading. Lift causes bending in the <b>flapwise</b> direction (out of rotor plane) while air flow around the blade cause edgewise bending (in the rotor plane). <b>Flapwise</b> bending involves tension on the pressure (upwind) side and compression on the suction (downwind) side. Edgewise bending involves tension on the leading edge and compression on the trailing edge.|$|E

30|$|It is also {{observed}} that the influence of taper ratio on fundamental <b>flapwise</b> bending natural frequency is increasing {{with the increase in}} angular speed and the influence is less on higher modes of vibration. The power law index has negligible influence on the trend of <b>flapwise</b> bending natural frequencies with the increase in angular speed for different taper ratios which is evident from similarity of variation pattern for solid (n[*]=[*] 0) and that for dashed (n[*]=[*] 2.0) and dotted (n[*]=[*] 4.0) lines for all modes of vibration. These trends should be expected that the tapered beams under consideration would behave differently, as the stiffness at the root and load variation {{along the length of the}} beam depend on the taper ratio.|$|E

Detailed wind measurements were acquired at two built environment sites: from the rooftop of a Bunnings Ltd. warehouse at Port Kennedy (PK) (Perth, Australia) and from the small wind turbine site at the University of Newcastle at Callaghan (Newcastle, Australia). For both sites, IEC 61400 - 2 underestimates the turbulence intensity {{for the majority of the}} measured wind speeds. A detailed aeroelastic model was built in FAST using the assumed wind field from IEC 61400 - 2 and the measured wind fields from PK and Callaghan as an input to predict key turbine performance parameters. The results of this analysis show a modest increase in the predicted mean power for the higher turbulence regimes of PK and Callaghan as well as higher variation in output power. Predicted mean rotor thrust and blade <b>flapwise</b> loading showed a minor increase due to higher turbulence, with mean predicted torque almost identical but with increased variations due to higher turbulence. Damage equivalent loading for the blade <b>flapwise</b> moment was predicted to be 58 % and 11 % higher for a turbine operating at Callaghan and PK respectively, when compared with IEC 61400 - 2 wind field.

40|$|Many modern {{wind turbine}} blades are {{constructed}} with a load-carrying box girder that supports the outer shell. The purpose of the box girder {{is to give the}} blade sufficient strength and stiffness, both globally and locally. Globally, the blade should be sufficiently stiff in order not to collide with the tower during operational loading. Locally, the box girder, together with the stiffness of the outer shell, ensures that the shape of the aerodynamic profile is maintained. The pressure and gravity load on the blade results in edgewise and <b>flapwise</b> bending, as well as torsional loading of the blade. The box girder primarily carries the <b>flapwise</b> and torsional loads, while the edgewise bending is carried mainly by strengthening the leading and trailing edges of the aerodynamic profile. In <b>flapwise</b> bending, one side of the box girder is in compression and one side in tension. The compressive loading may cause the flange to fail in buckling. It is well known that the boundary conditions have a large influence on the buckling strength of a panel. For the box girder, the transverse properties of the corner and web represent the boundary condition of the flange. The purpose of the investigations presented here is to measure transverse properties of a box girder experimentally in order to investigate how well different finite element models predict these transverse properties. This is expected to result in recommendations for how buckling of {{wind turbine blades}} ca...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{analytical and}} computational {{predictions of the}} performance of an operating 2. 5 m long composite wind turbine blade and compares these predictions with the results of detailed measurements. Part 1 of this paper describes in detail the important aspects of the 5 kW wind turbine, the experimental equipment and data acquisition procedures and presents and discusses some of the results from the experimental data. Here the analytical methodology of Eggleston and Stoddard (1987) and the solutions from the computational wind turbine software package Bladed, were used to predict the performance of the blade for a particular set of experimental conditions. The solutions of Eggleston and Stoddard, where only the first order dynamic equations of a simplified blade model are solved, underestimate the root <b>flapwise</b> moment, streamwise blade tip deflection and lead-lag tip deflection, but gave fairly accurate predictions for the blade lead lag moment. The turbine's structural dynamics within Bladed used a more accurate model of the blade and solved the structural dynamic equations by implementing modal analysis. The results gave root <b>flapwise</b> moment of the same order as those determined from the measurements, close agreement with the measured lead-lag moment, a slight under-prediction of the <b>flapwise</b> tip deflection and large under prediction of the lead-lag tip deflection. The under prediction of the lead-lag deflection by both methods is likely to be due to the uncoupling of the lead-lag and flapping motions, and the unusual shape of the blade close to its root connection...|$|E
40|$|That {{testing is}} usually {{performed}} about the <b>flapwise</b> and edgewise axes independently {{but a new}} method for resonant fatigue testing has been developed in which the <b>flapwise</b> and edgewise directions are tested simultaneously, thus also allowing the interactions between the two mutually perpendicular loads to be investigated. The method has been evaluated by comparing the Palmgren–Miner damage sum around the cross-section at selected points along the blade length that results from a simulated service life, as specified in the design standards, and testing. Bending moments at each point were generated using wind turbine simulation software and the test loads were designed to cause {{the same amount of}} damage as the true service life. The mode shape of the blade was tuned by optimising the position of the excitation equipment, so that the bending moment distribution was {{as close as possible to}} the target loads. The loads were converted to strain–time histories using strength of materials approach, and fatigue analysis was performed. The results show that if the bending moment distribution is correct along the length of the blade, then dual-axis resonant testing tests the blade much more thoroughly than sequential tests in the <b>flapwise</b> and edgewise directions. This approach is shown to be more representative of the loading seen in service and can thus contribute to a potential reduction in the weight of wind turbine blades and the duration of fatigue tests leading to reduced cost...|$|E

40|$|Flight {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} with a single-rotor helicopter {{to determine the effects}} of partial-power descents with forward speed, high-speed level turns, pull-outs from autorotation, and high-forward-speed high-rotor-speed autorotation on the <b>flapwise</b> bending and torsional moments of the rotor blade. One blade of the helicopter was equipped at 14 percent and 40 percent of the blade radius with strain gages calibrated to measure moments rather than stresses. The results indicate that the maximum moments encountered in partial-power descents with forward speed tend to be generally reduced from the maximum moments encountered during partid-power descents at zero forward speed. High-speed level turns and pull-outs from auto-rotation caused retreating-blade stall which produced torsional moments (values up to 2, 400 inch-pounds). at the 14 -percent-radius station that were as large as those encountered during the previous investigations of retreating-blade stall (values up t o 2, 500 inch-pounds). High-forward- speed high-rotor-speed autorotation produced <b>flapwise</b> bending moments (values up to 7, 200 inch-pounds) at the 40 -percent-radius station which were as large as the <b>flapwise</b> bending moments (values up to 7, 800 inch-pounds) a t the 14 -percent-radius station encountered during partial - power vertical descents. The results of the present investigation (tip-speed ratios up to 0. 325 and an unaccelerated level-flight mean lift coefficient of about 0. 6), in combination with the related results of at zero forward speed produce the largest rotor-blade vibratory moments. However, inasmuch as these large moments occur only during 1 percent of the cycles and 88 percent of the cycles are at moment values less than 70 percent of these maximum values in partial-power descents, other conditions, such as high-speed flight where the large moments are combined with large percentages of time spent,must not be neglected in any rotor-blade service-life assessment...|$|E

40|$|Material bend-twist {{coupling}} {{has been}} widely studied in the research community as a passive control mechanism for a wind turbine. However, {{there is a lack}} of research in incorporating it in the rotor design process, with little research being conducted for its application to small wind turbines. The present study focuses on this issue by including bend-twist coupling in the design of a 500 W wind turbine by using a combination of parametric studies and a multidisciplinary constrained optimisation approach. By doing so, it aims to establish the effectiveness of bend-twist coupling as a tool for passive load alleviation in small wind turbines. The effectiveness is tested through obtaining a significant decrease in the <b>flapwise</b> blade root bending moment accompanied by only a marginal decrease in the AEP, when compared with the baseline uncoupled turbine. The reference blade is designed under limitations imposed by the rules of the Small Wind Turbine Design Contest. Bend-twist coupling is introduced in the blades with a fixed aerodynamic design. The rotor performance is analysed inHAWCStab 2. The internal structure of the blade is created with the intention of producing flexible blades with a single composite material used throughout the blade. Carbon-epoxy and glass-epoxy FRPs are considered as the material to be chosen in the unidirectional laminae. The cross-sectional stiffness analysis is conducted using BECAS for a range of fibre layup angles in both carbon-fibre and glass-fibre blades. Carbon outperformed glass for all fibre angles with regard to the amount of coupling seen in the crosssections. Apart from <b>flapwise</b> bend-twist coupling, other secondary torsion couplings are also present. A load response study is carried out for varying positive fibre layup angles in both carbon-fibre and glass-fibre blades, under steady wind conditions for the operational wind speed range. An increase in the <b>flapwise</b> blade tip displacement and a reduction in the <b>flapwise</b> bending loads with increasing fibrelayup angles is observed for both glass-fibre and carbon-fibre blades. The HAWTOpt 2 aero-structural design tool using OpenMDAO as its core is utilised to implement the optimisation. The spanwise fibre layup angle and laminate thickness distribution are the only design variables that were allowed to be manipulated by the optimiser. The objective function is comprised of two different individual objective functions weighed according to the situation.

40|$|With {{the current}} trend toward larger and larger {{horizontal}} axis wind turbines, classical flutter is becoming a more critical issue. Recent {{studies have indicated that}} for a single blade turning in still air the flutter speed for a modern 35 meter blade occurs at approximately twice its operating speed (2 per rev), whereas for smaller blades (5 - 9 meters), both modern and early designs, the flutter speeds are in the range of 3. 5 - 6 per rev. Scaling studies demonstrate that the per rev flutter speed should not change with scale. Thus design requirements that change with increasing blade size are producing the concurrent reduction in per rev flutter speeds. In comparison with an early small blade design (5 meter blade), flutter computations indicate that the non-rotating modes which combine to create the flutter mode change as the blade becomes larger (i. e. for the larger blade the 2 nd <b>flapwise</b> mode, as opposed to the 1 st <b>flapwise</b> mode for the smaller blade, combines with the 1 st torsional mode to produce the flutter mode). For the more modern smaller blade design (9 meter blade), results show that the non-rotating modes that couple {{are similar to those of}} the larger blade. For the wings of fixed-wing aircraft, it is common knowledge that judicious selection of certain design parameters can increase the airspeed associated with the onset of flutter. Two parameters, the chordwise location of the center of mass and the ratio of the <b>flapwise</b> natural frequency to the torsional natural frequency, are especially significant. In this paper studies are performed to determine the sensitivity of the per rev flutter speed to these parameters for a 35 meter wind turbine blade. Additional studies are performed to determine which structural characteristics of the blade are most significant in explaining the previously mentioned per rev flutter speed differences. As a point of interest, flutter results are also reported for two recently designed 9 meter twist/coupled blades...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} fatigue {{analysis}} {{and testing of}} large, multi MW wind turbine blades. The blades {{are one of the}} most expensive components of a wind turbine, and their mass has cost implications for the hub, nacelle, tower and foundations of the turbine so it is important that they are not unnecessarily strong. Fatigue is often an important design driver, but fatigue of composites is poorly understood and so large safety factors are often applied to the loads. This has implications for the weight of the blade. Full scale fatigue testing of blades is required by the design standards, and provides manufacturers with confidence that the blade will be able to survive its service life. This testing is usually performed by resonating the blade in the <b>flapwise</b> and edgewise directions separately, but in service these two loads occur at the same time. A fatigue testing method developed at Narec (the National Renewable Energy Centre) in the UK in which the <b>flapwise</b> and edgewise directions are excited simultaneously has been evaluated by comparing the Palmgren-Miner damage sum around the blade cross section after testing with the damage distribution caused by the service life. A method to obtain the resonant test configuration that will result in the optimum mode shapes for the <b>flapwise</b> and edgewise directions was then developed, and simulation software was designed to allow the blade test to be simulated so that realistic comparisons between the damage distributions after different test types could be obtained. During the course of this work the shortcomings with conventional fatigue analysis methods became apparent, and a novel method of fatigue analysis based on multi-continuum theory and the kinetic theory of fracture was developed. This method was benchmarked using physical test data from the OPTIDAT database and was applied to the analysis of a complete blade. A full scale fatigue test method based on this new analysis approach is also discussed. ...|$|E
