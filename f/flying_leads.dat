50|$|In reining {{and working}} cow horse <b>flying</b> <b>lead</b> changes are an {{integral}} part of nearly all patterns except for those at the most novice levels. They performed as part of a pattern, usually in a figure eight, and illustrate a high degree of training and responsiveness. A good <b>flying</b> <b>lead</b> change appears effortless both in the horse's actions and in the rider's cues. The horse will not speed up or slow down or display resentment (i.e. by switching its tail excessively) or hesitation.

50|$|Because of {{the high}} {{frequencies}} often involved, oscilloscopes do not normally use simple wires ("flying leads") to connect to the DUT. <b>Flying</b> <b>leads</b> are likely to pick up interference, so they are not suitable for low-level signals. Furthermore, the inductance of <b>flying</b> <b>leads</b> make them unsuitable for high frequency signals. Instead, a specific scope probe is used, which uses a coaxial cable to transmit the signal {{from the tip of}} the probe to the oscilloscope. This cable has two main benefits: it protects the signal from external electromagnetic interference, improving accuracy for low-level signals; and it has a lower inductance than <b>flying</b> <b>leads,</b> making the probe more accurate for high-frequency signals.|$|E

5000|$|By 1982 the {{technology}} was sufficiently advanced for the technique to be called [...] "high-speed" [...] countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC). Peter Carmeci initially commercialized the PC Inc. Ito Multilayer Coil Separator/Extractor which utilized a single bobbin (onto which the coil is wound) and a counterbalance, plus a set of [...] "flying leads" [...] which are tubing that connect the bobbins. Dr. Walter Conway & others later evolved the bobbin design such that multiple coils, even coils of different tubing sizes, could {{be placed on the}} single bobbin. Edward Chou later evolved and commercialized a triple bobbin design as the Pharmatech CCC which had a de-twist mechanism for leads between the three bobbins. The Quattro CCC released in 1993 further evolved the commercially available instruments by utilizing a novel mirror image, twin bobbin design that did not need the de-twist mechanism of the Pharmatech between the multiple bobbins, so could still accommodate multiple bobbins on the same instrument. Hydrodynamic CCC are now available with up to 4 coils per instrument. These coils can be in PTFE, PEEK, PVDF, or stainless steel tubing. The 2, 3 or 4 coils can all be of the same bore to facilitate [...] "2D" [...] CCC (see below). The coils may be connected in series to lengthen the coil and increase the capacity, or the coils may be linked in parallel so that 2, 3, or 4 separations may be done simultaneously. The coils can also be of different sizes, on one instrument, ranging from 1 to 2 to 3.7 to 6 mm on one instrument, thus allowing a single instrument to optimize from mg to kilos per day. More recently instrument derivatives have started to be offered with rotating seals for various hydrodynamic CCC designs, instead of <b>flying</b> <b>leads,</b> either as custom options or as standard.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is an {{increased}} risk of venous thrombosis after air travel, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Our aim was to ascertain whether <b>flying</b> <b>leads</b> to a hypercoagulable state. METHODS: We did a crossover study in 71 healthy volunteers (15 men, 56 women), in whom we measured markers of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis before, during, and after an 8 -h flight. The same individuals participated in two control exposure situations (8 -h movie marathon and daily life) to separate the effect of air travel on the coagulation system from those of immobilisation and circadian rhythm. To study the effect of risk factors for thrombosis, we included participants with the factor V Leiden mutation (n= 11), those who took oral contraceptives (n= 15), or both (n= 15), as well as 30 individuals with no specific risk factors. FINDINGS: After the flight, median concentrations of thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex increased by 30. 1 % (95 % CI 11. 2 - 63. 2), but decreased by 2. 1 % (- 11. 2 to 14) after the cinema and by 7. 9 % (- 16. 2 to - 1. 2) after the daily life situation. We recorded a high response in TAT levels in 17 % (11 of 66) of individuals after air travel (3 % [2 of 68] for movie marathon; 1 % [1 of 70] in daily life). These findings were most evident in the group with the factor V Leiden mutation who used oral contraceptives. We noted a high response in all variables (prothrombin fragment 1 and 2, TAT, and D-dimer) in four of 63 (6. 3 %) volunteers after the flight, but in no-one after either of the control situations. INTERPRETATION: Activation of coagulation occurs in some individuals after an 8 -h flight, indicating an additional mechanism to immobilisation underlying air travel related thrombosi...|$|E
40|$|Formation flying of {{spacecraft}} {{has gained}} {{a lot of interest}} within the engineering and scientific community in recent years. However, formation <b>flying</b> <b>leads</b> to an increased complexity of the guidance and control system, whose complexity grows rapidly with the number of spacecraft in the formation. Moreover, there is an increasing need for autonomy to decrease the cost of ground support since ground support operations are often a non-negligible part of the cost of a mission. Therefore, a formation flying guidance and control system needs to perform autonomous decisions and trade-offs in real-time to decrease the number of tasks that need to be performed by the ground segment and make formation flying affordable. This work presents the development of analytical formation flying guidance and control laws for autonomous on-board applications. Firstly, an analytical model of relative motion for elliptical and perturbed reference orbits is developed. This model is solely based on the initial orbit elements of the reference trajectory and can predict the relative motion of any spacecraft orbiting close to the reference trajectory, taking into account the secular drift caused by the J 2 perturbation. Secondly, a new tool, the Fuel-Equivalent Space, is presented. The Fuel-Equivalent Space theory maps the relative orbit elements into a mathematical space where similar displacements on any axis is similar in terms of maneuvering fuel cost, therefore translating the minimum fuel problem into a simple distance minimization problem. Then, a neighbouring optimum feedback control law is developed. This feedback control law makes use of the optimal control theory to yield a semi-analytical controller that guarantees near-optimal maneuvering for any of the spacecraft orbiting close to the reference trajectory. Finally, it is shown that all these three new developments can be tied in together with simple analytical guidance laws to yield a fully autonomous guidance and control algorithm applicable to formation reconfiguration...|$|E

40|$|With the {{increased}} interest in developing offshore fields by subsea completions, also comes the need for minimizing the non-productive time of these systems caused by unexpected failures and lengthy repairs. Maintenance interventions {{that could be considered}} simple for surface equipment can become expensive and complicated when executed under water due to the difficult accessibility of the equipment. A simple failure of a subsea component can cause shutdown of a well for several days or even weeks until a repair is carried out, thus affecting hydrocarbon production rates significantly. Failure of components is unavoidable, but by introducing condition monitoring to subsea production systems (SPS), operators can diagnose and predict failures early, which allows them to plan maintenance activities in advance and reduce downtime. Most of today’s subsea control systems collect great amount of data about the process and the operational parameters of the equipment, but this information is not used to determine the condition of the asset and predict future failures. The aim of this thesis is to develop a methodology tailored for conventional SPS, for appropriate utilization of available monitoring techniques and identification of additional surveillance methods needed to guarantee high system availability. Furthermore, this methodology describes how to integrate these monitoring methods into a comprehensive condition monitoring program that is able to detect asset state, diagnose faults, predict future failures and provide decision support for maintenance intervention. Considerable research and many standards have been written for condition monitoring of complex machinery, mostly for rotating machinery and some static machines for surface or onshore facilities, but little investigation has been done with respect to subsea equipment. The purpose of this research study is to bridge the gap by creating a set of guidelines for implementation of condition monitoring specifically for SPS, and make recommendations for application of these guidelines for the benefit of both field operators and subsea equipment manufacturers. A methodic process was created to guide the user through the different steps of creating a program for condition monitoring of underwater equipment, with emphasis in the active elements used to measure and control the flow of oil and gas, i. e. control systems (SCM, instruments, sensors, valves, electrical/hydraulic <b>flying</b> <b>leads,</b> etc.) and production equipment (XTs, manifolds and distribution units). Risers, flowlines, umbilicals, structures and subsea processing systems are excluded from this work. The methodology is exemplified with two case studies: First for gate valves with hydraulic actuators and, second for the power supply unit located in the subsea electronic module...|$|E
