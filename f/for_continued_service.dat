5|$|As the RAF {{received}} newer aircraft {{capable of}} supersonic speeds {{to perform the}} air interceptor role, many Hunters were modified and re-equipped for undertaking ground-attack and reconnaissance missions instead. Hunters deemed surplus to the RAF's requirements were also quickly refurbished <b>for</b> <b>continued</b> <b>service</b> abroad. The Hunter would be procured by {{a considerable number of}} foreign nations. In addition to former RAF aircraft, roughly half of the nearly 2,000 Hunters produced had been manufactured specifically for overseas customers. The Hunter would be in operational service with the RAF for over 30 years. As late as 1996, hundreds were still in active service with various operators across the world.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Villeneuve's fugitives, the French Mediterranean Fleet had been annihilated. Nine of eleven ships of the line had been captured or destroyed, {{as well as two}} frigates. French casualties totalled more than 3,000 and possibly as many as 5,000, compared to British losses of 218 killed and 677 wounded. However, many of Nelson's ships were seriously damaged, and urgent repairs were required for both his own ships and the captured prizes before they could begin the long voyage back to Britain. For more than two weeks Nelson remained in Aboukir Bay, effecting repairs, writing despatches and assessing the strategic situation in Egypt. The first ship detached from his squadron was Leander, sent on 5 August to the fleet under Earl St. Vincent off Cadiz with reports of the battle. On 8 August Aboukir Island was stormed and captured, and on 12 August Emerald, Alcmene and Bonne Citoyenne finally caught up with the fleet, followed on 17 August by Seahorse and Terpsichore. Mutine was detached on 13 August with despatches for the Admiralty and on 14 August Nelson sent seven ships with the six seaworthy prizes to the mouth of Aboukir Bay under the command of Saumarez. This convoy sailed for Gibraltar on 15 August and the following day Nelson burnt Heureux, followed on 18 August by Mercure and Guerrier, none of which were fit <b>for</b> <b>continued</b> <b>service.</b> On 19 August Nelson separated his remaining ships, leading three vessels northwards towards Naples and leaving a blockade squadron off Alexandria of Zealous, Goliath, Swiftsure and the frigates, under Captain Samuel Hood.|$|E

25|$|Monarque was towed into Portsmouth and was {{surveyed}} {{there in}} July 1748. The Navy Board authorised her purchase for the navy on 30 September 1748, paying {{the sum of}} £17,555.16.8d, having deducted a sum for repairs. A small repair was carried out and she was fitted for service between December 1748 and March 1749. Monarch commissioned for service in December 1748 {{under the command of}} Captain Robert Harland, and became the guardship at Portsmouth. She passed to Captain John Amherst in 1751, still serving as the Portsmouth guardship, but returned to sea later that year to carry troops to Menorca. She was paid off in November 1752, and fitted <b>for</b> <b>continued</b> <b>service</b> as a guardship the following year. She recommissioned as the Portsmouth guardship in January 1753 under Captain Roger Martin, and was again involved in trooping duties, this time Gibraltar in 1754. She passed under Captain Henry Harrison in 1754, followed by Captain Abraham North in 1755. Monarch became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Savage Mostyn, and sailed for North America in April 1755.|$|E
500|$|When the MBTA {{began to}} subsidise {{commuter}} rail services {{on a line}} (this happened at different times for different lines), service on the line often extended beyond the boundary of the MBTA's service district at the time; communities located outside the district could (if they wished) contract with the MBTA for continued commuter rail service to {{some or all of}} the stations located in the community in question. [...] Most of the following stations were located in out-of-district communities that either did not contract <b>for</b> <b>continued</b> <b>service,</b> or else paid for service to some but not all of their stations; the remainder were stations in in-district communities which the MBTA decided to allow the railroad providing service to abandon. [...] (Stations to which service was later resumed are not included.) ...|$|E
500|$|When Castor {{returned}} to Britain, the frigate was classed by the Admiralty and the Navy Board as [...] "salvage" [...] {{rather than as}} a prize. The laws regarding salvage meant that the proportion of prize money due to be paid to Laforey and his crew was significantly reduced by the declaration. The grounds for this judgement were that after its capture by the French, Castor was not taken into a French harbour and properly condemned by a French prize court and commissioned into the French Navy, the normal legal requirement for what was termed a [...] "complete prize". On behalf of his men Laforey brought a legal challenge against the ruling to the High Court of Admiralty to determine the status of Castor. The judge, Sir James Marriott, heard evidence from a number of parties, including a deposition by Captain L'Huillier that described Admiral Nielly's standing orders to fit out any captured warships at sea <b>for</b> <b>continued</b> <b>service</b> in the campaign. After considering the evidence Marriott ruled that Castor was a legitimate prize [...] "setting forth as a ship of war", and that the normal prize rules should apply to Laforey's case. The prize money for the purchase of the frigate was therefore authorised to be paid at Plymouth on 20 July 1795.|$|E

2500|$|Only his {{activities}} during the three-year span of 1567-70 are documented, but those in some detail. [...] In 1567 he published in Treviso {{a book of}} canzoni, secular songs on his own verse. [...] By early 1568 he was in Munich, {{in the service of}} the House of Wittelsbach, singing in the Bavarian Hofkapelle under the direction of Orlande de Lassus. He traveled between Munich and Venice at least twice, with one extended stay in Venice in 1569, where he waited for the Duke of Bavaria to send him money and an acceptance letter <b>for</b> <b>continued</b> <b>service.</b> [...] He remained in Munich until Easter 1570, when he was accused of murdering one of his musical colleagues, and fled. [...] A warrant was issued for his arrest, but he was never found, and there is no known documentation of his activity after that time.|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately for Bader, fighter aircraft's roles had {{now grown}} {{significantly}} {{and he spent}} most of his time instructing on ground attack and co-operation with ground forces. Also, Bader did not get on with the newer generation of squadron leaders who considered him to be [...] "out of date". In the end, Air Marshal James Robb offered Bader a role commanding the North Weald sector of No. 11 Group RAF, an organisation steeped in Fighter Command and Battle of Britain history. It is likely Bader would have stayed in the RAF for some time had his mentor Leigh-Mallory not been killed in an air crash in November 1944, such was the respect and influence he held over Bader, but Bader's enthusiasm <b>for</b> <b>continued</b> <b>service</b> in the RAF waned. On 21 July 1946, Bader retired from the RAF with the rank of group captain to take a job at Royal Dutch Shell.|$|E

5000|$|One {{reason why}} Islam became more {{favorable}} in India {{was due to}} the establishment of khanqah. A khanqah is commonly defined as a hospice, lodge, community center, or dormitory ran by Sufis. Khanqahs were also known as Jama'at Khana, large gathering halls. Structurally, a khanqah could be one large room or have additional dwelling space. [...] Although some khanqah establishments were independent of royal funding or patronage, many received fiscal grants (waqf) and donations from benefactors <b>for</b> <b>continuing</b> <b>services.</b> Over time, the function of traditional Sufi khanqahs evolved as Sufism solidified in India.|$|R

He had wished with all his might to live, and though he had resigned himself dutifully, it had been with a real struggle, and a longing <b>for</b> <b>continued</b> <b>service</b> rather than rest, a hope that he should more efficiently serve, and much difficulty in refraining from laying all about him under injunctions for the future.|$|E
60|$|There was not, even in {{the array}} of the Earl of Northumberland's men-at-arms, any {{approach}} to the uniformity that now prevails among bodies of soldiers. The helmets, breast and back pieces, were, however, of similar form, as the men engaged <b>for</b> <b>continued</b> <b>service</b> were furnished with armour by the earl; {{but there was a}} great variety in the garments worn under them, these being of all colours, according to the fancy of their wearers. All, however, carried spears of the same length, while some had swords, and others heavy axes at their girdles. The helmets and armour were all brightly polished, and as the lights of the torches flashed from them and from the spearheads; Oswald, for the first time, witnessed something of the pomp of war.|$|E
