500|$|As {{a result}} of the firing on Fort Sumter, President Lincoln sent a {{telegram}} to Governor Magoffin requesting that the Commonwealth supply four regiments as its share of the overall request of 75,000 troops for the war. Magoffin, a Confederate sympathizer, replied, [...] "President Lincoln, Washington, D.C. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>send</b> not a man nor a dollar for the wicked purpose of subduing my sister Southern states. B. Magoffin" [...] Both houses of the General Assembly met on May 7 and passed declarations of neutrality in the war, a position officially declared by Governor Magoffin on May 20.|$|E
500|$|The opening movement, [...] "" [...] (Behold, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>send</b> {{out many}} fishers), {{is given to}} the bass solo, {{possibly}} because Jeremiah has God speak in the first person. The music follows the text in two sections, as in a motet. Probably therefore Bach avoided the title aria and wrote [...] instead. Some cantatas on texts by Christiana Mariana von Ziegler from the second annual cycle begin in a similar way with a bible quotation, of Jesus saying [...] "" [...] (I am a Good Shepherd, BWV 85), [...] "" [...] (It is good for you that I leave, BWV 108), and Jesus saying [...] "" [...] (Until now you have asked for nothing in My name, BWV 87).|$|E

500|$|The two {{sections}} reflect two concepts {{mentioned in the}} text,"" [...] (fishermen) and [...] "" [...] (hunters). The first section paints a seascape in undulating figuration of the strings with the oboes in 6/8 time on a pedal point. Bach [...] "represents the movement of waves and water", which is termed barcarolle by John Eliot Gardiner, the conductor of the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000. The voice presents the text several times in varied declamation. Suddenly the scene changes to a hunting scene, horns join the orchestra, the tempo in common time is marked [...] "". The voice is again set in expressive declamation, saying [...] "And afterwards <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>send</b> out many hunters...".|$|E
500|$|The Morning Advertiser {{thought that}} [...] "There is an evident attempt {{to copy the}} creations of a foreign {{composer}} who is so popular at the present time, and who has written some charming music for the gods and goddesses en bouffes." [...] Others accused Sullivan of blatant copying. The Athenaeum wrote that the music [...] "was arranged and composed by Mr A. S. Sullivan (the first verb {{was not in the}} bills as it ought to have been)". One critic thought that the duet for Sparkeion and Nicemis, [...] "Here far away from all the world", was one of the [...] "single best items of the piece". In 1873, the arranger Joseph Rummell (who had arranged Sullivan's Merchant of Venice score for the piano) wrote to Sullivan, asking about the song, with a view to publication. The composer replied, [...] "Thespis is not published but if you like <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>send</b> you the Full Score of the Duet in question", but nothing came of it.|$|E

2500|$|Academics {{showed little}} {{interest}} in this topic until recently. This was not, however, the case with popular writers from non-conforming backgrounds, who interspersed the text of Revelation with the prophecy they thought was being promised. For example, an anonymous Scottish commentary of 1871 prefaces Revelation 4 with the Little Apocalypse of Mark 13, places Malachi 4:5 ("Behold <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>send</b> you Elijah the prophet before {{the coming of the}} great and dreadful day of the Lord") within Revelation 11 and writes Revelation 12:7 side-by-side with the role of [...] "the Satan" [...] in the Book of Job. The message is that everything in Revelation will happen in its previously appointed time.|$|E
2500|$|On April 15, 1861, President Abraham Lincoln sent a {{telegram}} to Kentucky governor Beriah Magoffin requesting that the Commonwealth supply {{part of the}} initial 75,000 troops {{to put down the}} rebellion. Magoffin, a Southern sympathizer, replied [...] "President Lincoln, Washington, D.C. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>send</b> not a man nor a dollar for the wicked purpose of subduing my sister Southern states. B. Magoffin" [...] Instead, most Kentuckians favored John J. Crittenden's position that the Commonwealth should act as a mediator between the two sides. To that end, both houses of the General Assembly passed declarations of neutrality, a position officially declared by Governor Magoffin on May 20, 1861.|$|E
2500|$|In Augustine's {{time it was}} the {{universal}} belief. , [...] "When he (Malachi) had admonished them to remember the law of Moses, because he foresaw, that they would {{for a long time}} not receive it spiritually, as it ought, he added immediately; [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>send</b> you Elias the Thisbite" [...] etc. That when, through this Elias, the great and wonderful prophet, at the last time before the judgment, the law shall have been expounded to them, the Jews shall believe in the true Christ, i. e., in our Christ, is everywhere in the mouths and hearts of the faithful. For not without reason is it hoped, that he shall come before the Coming of the Saviour, as Judge, because not without reason is it believed that he still lives. For he was carried in a chariot of fire from things below; which Scripture most evidently attests. When he shall come then, by expounding the law spiritually, which the Jews now understand carnally, he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{the final}} mention of Elijah in the Hebrew Bible {{is in the}} Book of Chronicles, the Christian Bible's {{ordering}} of the books of the Septuagint places the Book of Malachi, which prophesies a messiah, before the Gospels [...] and means that Elijah's final Old Testament appearance is in the Book of Malachi, where it is written, [...] "Lo, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>send</b> you the prophet Elijah before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes." [...] That day is described as the burning of a great furnace, [...] "... {{so that it will}} leave them neither root nor branch." [...] In Christianity it is traditionally believed that Elijah's appearance during the transfiguration of Jesus fulfilled this prophecy. Moreover, in the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus identifies John the Baptist as the spiritual successor to Elijah: [...] "and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come." [...] Finally, the verses in Malachi are believed to indicate that Elijah has a role in the end-times, immediately before the second coming of Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|Then , the Sun, {{said that}} it was time for the first four Holy People to depart from the surface of the Fourth World. These four, who had come from the First World, were First Man, , First Woman, , , Great Coyote, and the coyote , First Angry. They {{traveled}} east, beyond the house of the Sun, and took all their powers with them. As they began to travel, First Woman turned and said, [...] "When I wish to do so, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>send</b> back death from disease, and the sign will be the howl of the coyote." [...] Then the four Holy People who had come up from the Third World departed as well. They were , Talking God, , Water Sprinkler, , House God, and , Black God, the god of fire. As they departed, [...] said, [...] "If anyone sees us it will be a sign that an enemy is coming into the country. If he hears us call, that same person will be killed by an enemy before the day is over." [...] And so saying they all returned to their homes and all their powers went with them.|$|E
2500|$|This {{difference}} between following either the Ahl al-Bayt (Muhammad's family and descendants) or Caliph Abu Bakr has shaped Shia and non-Shia views {{on some of}} the Quranic verses, the hadith (narrations from Muhammad) and other areas of Islam. For instance, the collection of hadith venerated by Shia Muslims is centered on narrations by members of the Ahl al-Bayt and their supporters, while some hadith by narrators not belonging to or supporting the Ahl al-Bayt are not included. Those of Abu Hurairah, for example, Ibn Asakir in his Ta'rikh Kabir and Muttaqi in his Kanzu'l-Umma report that Caliph Umar lashed him, rebuked him and forbade him to narrate hadith from Muhammad. Umar said: [...] "Because you narrate hadith in large numbers from the Holy Prophet, you are fit only for attributing lies to him. (That is, one expects a wicked man like you to utter only lies about the Holy Prophet.) So you must stop narrating hadith from the Prophet; otherwise, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>send</b> you to the land of Dus." [...] (A clan in Yemen, to which Abu Huraira belonged.) According to Sunnis, Ali was the fourth successor to Abu Bakr, while the Shia maintain that Ali was the first divinely sanctioned [...] "Imam", or successor of Muhammad. The seminal event in Shia history is the martyrdom in 680 CE at the Battle of Karbala of Ali's son Hussein ibn Ali, who led a non-allegiance movement against the defiant caliph (71 of Hussein's followers were killed as well). Hussein came to symbolize resistance to tyranny.|$|E
