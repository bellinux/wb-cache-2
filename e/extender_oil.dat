30|$|The {{intention}} of the SiS concept is to regulate substances of very high concern as constituents or impurities in substances, mixtures, and in articles. In principle this is already realised in certain entries of Annex XVII. As a first case, Germany is preparing an Annex XV dossier for the PAH benzo[a]pyrene as substance in substance. Benzo[a]pyrene is the most prominent PAH known for CMR and vPvB-properties, and already regulated in mixtures for consumer uses (Annex XVIII), as an impurity in toys and as <b>extender</b> <b>oil</b> {{for the production of}} tyres or parts of tyres (Annex XVII, entry 50).|$|E
40|$|Sub-micrometer (µm) {{thermoplastic}} vulcanizates (TPVs) with cross-linked rubber particles with sizes {{ranging from}} 70 to 400 nm were prepared by reaction-induced phase separation (RIPS) of initially miscible blends of poly(ethylene) (PE), lauryl methacrylate (LMA) and divinylbenzene (DVB). Cross-linking under static conditions led to (partial) connectivity of the rubber particles via chemical bridging of grafted PE chains. Dynamic preparation conditions caused the connected structure to break-up, {{which led to}} a significant enhancement of the mechanical properties and the melt processability. The addition of 25 – 80 wt% <b>extender</b> <b>oil</b> resulted in a reduced complex viscosity and yield stress in the melt, without deteriorating the mechanical properties. The relatively good elastic recovery and excellent ultimate properties of these high hardness TPVs may be explained by the sub-µm rubber dispersions...|$|E
40|$|Gels of polystyrene-block-rubber-block-polystyrene were {{investigated}} by small-angle X-ray (SAXS) and neutron (SANS) scattering. The rubber midblock was either poly(ethylene/propylene) (PS-PEP-PS) or poly(ethylene/butylene) (PS-PEB-PS). The gels of these thermoplasts have similar superstructures consisting of domains of associated polystyrene (PS) blocks, connected by the midblocks which are dissolved in an <b>extender</b> <b>oil.</b> The microphase separation is {{more pronounced in}} the PS-PEP-PS gels and results in clear interdomain scattering maxima and form factor oscillations. The ordering of the PS domains {{is a function of}} block copolymer concentration, molar mass, end block/midblock ratio, deformation, and temperature. Deformations up to 150 % extension are reversible at room temperature. The scattering patterns of the unstretched samples were fitted with two different models: a hard-sphere liquid model and a model of a disordered solid with local coordination. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{criteria}} {{for assessing the}} quality of rubber materials are the polymer or copolymer composition and the additives. These additives include plasticizers, <b>extender</b> <b>oils,</b> carbon black, inorganic fillers, antioxidants, heat and light stabilizers, processing aids, cross-linking agents, accelerators, retarders, adhesives, pigments, smoke and flame retardants, and others. Determination of additives in polymers or copolymers generally requires the extraction of these substances from the matrix as a first step, which can be challenging, and the subsequent analysis of the extracted additives by gas chromatography (GC), GC-mass spectrometry (MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), HPLC-MS, capillary electrophoresis, thin-layer chromatography, and other analytical techniques. In the present work, nitrile rubber materials were studied using direct analytical flash pyrolysis hyphenated to GC and electrospray ionization MS in both scan and selected ion monitoring modes to demonstrate that this technique is a good tool to identify the organic additives in nitrile rubber...|$|R
50|$|Ramtil oil, {{also known}} as Niger Seed Oil is used mainly in cooking but also for lighting. In India it is pressed from the seed of Guizotia oleifera of the family Asteraceae. A very similar oil is made in Africa from G. abyssinica. The oil is used as an <b>extender</b> for sesame <b>oil,</b> which it resembles, {{as well as for}} making soap, in {{addition}} to its role as an illuminant, and many other uses.|$|R
40|$|The oils are {{generally}} {{added in the}} rubber compounds to improve processing properties, low temperature properties, dispersion of fillers, and to reduce cost. The conventionally widely used oils in tire compounds are Distillate Aromatic Extract (DAE) oils, which contain {{a high concentration of}} Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs that can be released from tires by tire wear are harmful to health and environment, so safe process oils are needed to replace aromatic oil in tire compounds. This thesis comparatively studies the influences of PAH-free petroleum based <b>extender</b> <b>oils,</b> i. e. Treated Distillate Aromatic Extract (TDAE) and Mild Extracted Solvate (MES), versus the DAE oil on the properties of NR-based truck tire tread compounds and NR/SBR-based passenger tire tread compounds. Oil characterization data are analyzed, and the influence of the oils on the properties of unfilled compounds is also elucidated. The different chemical structures and compositions of DAE-, TDAE- and MES-oils that affect on their characteristics, have influences on their compatibility with rubbers and the properties of the corresponding rubber compounds. The theoretical predictions based on differences in solubility parameters (Δδ) and the experimental swelling study agree well in that MES is less compatible with NR and SBR compared with TDAE and DAE. The difference of cure characteristics, due to the presence of nitrogen-and sulfur-heterocyclic species in DAE oil, as observed in unfilled compounds, is diminished in the carbon black-filled compounds. The mechanical properties of both unfilled and carbon black filled compounds are little influenced by the change of oil types, but the properties are changed according to the oil loadings, basically due to the dilution effect. The different glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the oils affect the Tg’s of the rubber vulcanizates and hence the viscoelastic-related properties, i. e. abrasion resistance, rebound resilience, heat build-up and loss tangent. The replacement of toxic DAE by safe TDAE and MES enhances the elastic response of the materials. Based on the processing properties of the uncured compounds and mechanical as well as dynamic properties of the vulcanizates, TDAE oil provides better overall properties as replacement for DAE oil than MES...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show how the rheology, the {{performance}} and the storage stability of different bituminous binders, obtained from two bitumens with different asphaltenes content, change their properties when they are modified with recycled tyre crumb rubber. Physical, chemical and performance characterisation followed by rheological and storage stability analyses have been undertaken as the basis for the comparison. The results of the investigation indicate that bitumen with lower asphaltenes content is more influenced by the modification with the rubber. However, the modification of the bitumen with the higher asphaltenes content gives a binder with better performance and storage stability. Moreover, results shows that the addition of a certain amount of <b>oil</b> <b>extender</b> to the bitumens reduces the effect of the modification and has no positive effect on storage stability...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA good {{road network}} is a {{critical}} infrastructure requirement for rapid economic growth. It provides connectivity to remote areas; provides accessibility to markets, schools, and hospitals; and opens up backward regions to trade and investment. Roads {{play an important role}} in inter-modal transport development, through links with airports, railway stations, and ports. Road network in India aggregates to about 4. 2 million kilometers. This extensive road network, the second largest in the world only after US, caters to about 65 per cent of the freight traffic and 87 per cent of the passenger traffic. National Highways (NH) constitute about 70, 934 kilometers which is only 2 percent of the total network. However, it caters to nearly 40 % of the total road traffic. State Highways (SH) and Major District Roads (MDR) together constitute the secondary system of road transportation which contributes significantly to the development of the rural economy and industrial growth of the country. The conventional method of providing bituminous surfacing on flexible pavements require significant amount of energy for production of bituminous binder from crude petroleum, drying aggregates and subsequently production of bituminous mix at hot mix plant (HMP). Hot mix recycling is the process in which reclaimed asphalt pavement materials are combined with new materials, sometimes along with a recycling agent, to produce hot mix asphalt mixtures. When properly designed, recycled mixtures can have better or similar performance to those of new conventional hot mix asphalt mixtures. Recycling or Rejuvenating agents have been defined as organic materials with chemical and physical characteristics selected to restore properties of aged asphalt to desired specifications. In selecting the recycling agent, the viscosity characteristics of the combined aged asphalt binder and the recycling agent are the determining factors. These agents are also known as softening agents, reclaiming agents, modifiers, fluxing <b>oils,</b> <b>extender</b> <b>oils,</b> and aromatic oils. The choice of Recycling Agent (RA) grade will depend on the amount and hardness of the asphalt in the aged pavement. In general, the lower viscosity RA types can be used to restore aged asphalts of high viscosity and vice versa. Laboratory studies have been carried out on asphalt mixes with RAP material and rejuvenating agent and their performance has been compared with virgin asphalt mixes. Various performance tests such as Retained Stability, Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS), Creep test, beam fatigue test, resilient modulus and wheel tracking test has been carried out to compare the performance properties. This paper presents the results of all such performance tests carried out on asphalt mixes with RAP and virgin mixes. The laboratory results indicate that the asphalt mixes with RAP and rejuvenating agent provide better performance compared to virgin mixes. The paper also recommends that the Accelerated Pavement Testing Facility (APTF) should be put to use to evaluate the actual field performance of recycled pavements in a faster and effective manner...|$|R
