Using ANSYS－FLOTRAN CFD program, the temperature field and the stream field in sensing element of three wire structure and two wire structure under {{the effect of the}} different tilt state, has been obtained by a series of procedure, such as model building, meshing, loads applying and equation solving. The results are as follow: In tilt status, the airflow rate difference of three wire structure is nearly five times bigger than two wire structure in the two heat sources. Three wire structure makes heating wire separated from <b>detection</b> <b>wire,</b> solves the contradiction between operating current and output sensitivity, and decrease operating current. The test results show: The compare between three wire {{structure of}} the airflow level posture sensor and two wire {{structure of the}} airflow level posture sensor is that the sensitivity increases from 10 mV / ° to 18 mV/°,response time decreases from 100 mS to 40 mS,operating current decreases from 80 mA to 40 mA, so three wire structure is better than two wire structure...|$|E

40|$|Anomaly <b>Detection</b> in <b>Wire</b> Ropes is an {{important}} problem. Detecting suspicious anomalies in the rope surface is challenging because {{of the variety of}} its visual appearance caused by reflections or mud on the rope surface. This hinders the discrimination between uncritical variations and small defects within the rope surface enormously. The fact that nearly no defective samples are available to train a supervised system relates this problem to the concept of one-class classification (OCC). In this work we show how to utilize one-class classification with Gaussian processes (GP) to detect anomalies in wire ropes. The method allows modeling the distribution of non-defective data in a non-parametric manner. Furthermore, it is really easy to implement (few lines of code), embedded in a Bayesian framework, and can be used with arbitrary kernel functions. Therefore, it is suitable {{for a wide range of}} defect localization applications. Our experiments, performed on two real ropes, demonstrate that the GP framework for OCC clearly outperforms former approaches for anomaly <b>detection</b> in <b>wire</b> ropes. The obtained results are comparable with or even outperform those obtained with the Support Vector Data Description, which is the state of the art reference in the field of one-class classification. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{propose a}} chaos time-domain {{reflectometry}} (CTDR) for locat-ing faults on live wires. This method uses a chaotic output of an improved Colpitts oscillator as probe signal, and detects wire faults by correlating a du-plicate with {{the echo of}} the probe signal. Benefiting from the anti-jamming of the correlation function of the wideband chaos, fault location on live wires can be achieved. We experimentally demonstrate the <b>detection</b> for live <b>wires</b> in a digital communication system, in which a type of digital signal named high density bipolar of order 3 (HDB 3) is transmitted. The effects of the chaotic probe signal on the bit error rate (BER) of the transmitted HDB 3 at different rates are analyzed. Meanwhile, the influences of the backward HDB 3 reflected by wiring faults on the signal-noise-ratio (SNR) of CTDR measurement are examined experimentally. The results show that fault <b>detection</b> on live <b>wires</b> is achieved when {{the power of the}} chaotic probe signal is about from- 24. 8 dB to- 13. 5 dB lower than that of the transmitted digital signal. In this case, the BER is kept less than 3 E- 10, and the SNR of CTDR is higher than 3 dB. Besides, the auto-correlation properties of the improved Colpitts oscillator at different states are investigated experimentally to explore the suitable chaotic states for the CTDR...|$|R

Geometric descriptors of the model are also proposed. The profile model is empirically shown to be effective and easily applicable to certain object recognition and segmentation tasks. Application experiments include modeling thin and thick objects as straight-lines, curves, and blobs using different primitives such as gray-level intensities, RGB, and HSV color. The datasets used for empirical validation are quite challenging. Datasets include images and videos corresponding to outdoor video, most of them with moving cameras. Some of the typical problems faced with the used datasets are: digital scaling, compression artifacts, camera jitter, weather effects, and cluttered backgrounds. We demonstrate the potential of leveraging the context of objects of interest as a part of an online detection process.

40|$|Time-domain and frequency-domain {{reflectometry}} {{have been used}} for about forty years to locate opens and shorts in cables. Interpretation of reflectometry data is as much art as science. Is there information in the data that is being missed? Can the reflectometers be improved to allow us to detect and locate defects in cables that are not outright shorts or opens? The Hybrid Reflectometer Project was begun this year at NASA Ames Research Center, initially to model wire physics, simulating time-domain reflectometry (TDR) signals in those models and validating the models against actual TDR data taken on testbed cables. Theoretical models of reflectometry in wires will give us an understanding of the merits and limits of these techniques and will guide the application of a proposed hybrid reflectometer with the aim of enhancing reflectometer sensitivity to the point that wire defects can be detected. We will point out efforts by some other researchers to apply wire physics models to the problem of defect <b>detection</b> in <b>wires</b> and we will describe our own initial efforts to create wire physics models and report on testbed validation of the TDR simulations...|$|R

40|$|Wire ropes {{are exposed}} to huge {{external}} powers every day. Unfortunately, {{this can lead to}} structural anomalies or even defects in the rope formation. A defective rope bears a high risk for human life. This motivates the strict rules summarized in the European norm [1], which instruct a regular inspection of wire ropes. Recent approaches to defect detection in surfaces or fabrics mostly are lim-ited to texture analysis [2]. Usually not enough defective samples are available in advance. Therefore texture-based approaches are often combined with one-class classification, also called novelty detection [3]. In [4] anomaly <b>detection</b> in <b>wire</b> rope data was performed using linear prediction as feature extraction com-bined with a multi-channel one-class classification strategy. However, all these approaches are not able to detect structural changes in the rope structure. Thus, we propose a new approach for model-based detection of surface defects and structural deviations from the normal rope geometry. A wire rope is composed of strands which itself are composed out of single wires. Every wire can be described by a helix and a mathematical description of the rope geometry can be given by the space curve of the j-th wire in the i-th strand: sWi,j (t, rW, LW, nW) = rW · cos(t 2 p...|$|R
