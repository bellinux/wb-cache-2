5|$|After Saladin conquered {{almost the}} whole Kingdom of Jerusalem {{in the second}} half of 1187, Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem, sought shelter in Tripoli, which became a center of her supporters. The noblemen who {{condemned}} her husband, Guy of Lusignan, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the kingdom, joined Conrad of Montferrat at Tyros. Saladin decided to invade the crusader states in Syria. He started his military campaign against Tripoli in May 1188, but the arrival of the fleet of William II of Sicily saved the town. After Saladin captured Tortosa and Jabala (present-day Tartus and Jableh in Syria) in July, only Tripoli, Krak des Chevaliers, and the citadel at Tortosa remained under Christian rule in the county.|$|E

5|$|On 18 March the PAVN {{had taken}} Phuoc An, {{eliminating}} {{any hope of}} reaching Buôn Ma Thuột. Darlac Province in its entirety then fell under North Vietnamese control.

In the final analysis, the blame <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the highlands lies with General Phú, who refused to act on sound intelligence and when he realized his error, {{it was too late to}} get reinforcements to the scene.|$|E
5|$|The Augustinian theodicy {{supports}} {{the notion of}} original sin. All versions of this theodicy accept the theological implications of the Genesis creation narrative, including the belief that God created human beings without sin or suffering. Evil {{is believed to be}} a just punishment <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of man: when Adam and Eve first disobeyed God and were exiled from the Garden of Eden. The free will of humans is offered by the Augustinian theodicy as the continued reason for moral evil: people commit immoral acts when their will is evil. The evil nature of human will is attributed to original sin; Augustinian theologians argue that the sin of Adam and Eve corrupted the will of human beings, maintaining that God is blameless and good, and not himself responsible for evil.|$|E

5|$|The traffic {{projections}} for the bridge {{at the planning stage}} {{have not been}} achieved. A traffic survey carried out for a week during June 2012 recorded traffic of 29,000 vehicles over the bridge in comparison to a projected 85,000. A survey conducted during the same period in June 2012 indicated a figure of 31,865 vehicles, though it is reported by the concerned traffic and transportation engineer that the rate of increase in traffic has been one percent per year on the basis of traffic surveys carried out from the time of commissioning of the bridge. The reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> in traffic during 2012 is attributed to the peak monsoon effect during the survey period.|$|E
