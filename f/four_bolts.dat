5|$|The A-10 was envisioned to {{fly from}} forward air bases and semi-prepared runways with {{high risk of}} foreign object damage to the engines. The unusual {{location}} of the General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofan engines decreases ingestion risk, and allows the engines to run while the aircraft is serviced and rearmed by ground crews, reducing turn-around time. The wings are also mounted closer to the ground, simplifying servicing and rearming operations. The heavy engines require strong supports: <b>four</b> <b>bolts</b> connect the engine pylons to the airframe. The engines' high 6:1 bypass ratio contributes to a relatively small infrared signature, and their position directs exhaust over the tailplanes further shielding it from detection by infrared homing surface-to-air missiles. The engines and exhausts are angled upward by nine degrees to cancel out the nose-down pitching moment that would otherwise generate from being mounted above the aircraft's center of gravity and avoids the need to trim the control surfaces to prevent pitching.|$|E
25|$|After {{investigators}} recovered all <b>four</b> <b>bolts,</b> sleeves, and pins, {{they found}} that the parts that were not replaced were counterfeit and were incorrectly heat-treated during manufacture. Those bolts each could bear only about 60% of their intended breaking strength, making them less than practical to use on the aircraft. The fake bolts and sleeves wore down excessively, causing the tail to vibrate for 16 completed flights and the accident flight.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 7 astronauts Clay Anderson and Rick Mastracchio {{performed}} {{their second}} spacewalk of the STS-131 mission. Mastracchio and Anderson exited the airlock at 05:30 UTC, a full 45 minutes {{ahead of the}} planned time, and spent 7 hours and 26 minutes outside the ISS. The pair removed the old Ammonia Tank Assembly (ATA) from the S1 truss and installed the new ATA. Anderson and Mastracchio ran into a small problem {{when one of the}} <b>four</b> <b>bolts</b> that holds the tank in place wouldn't turn. They loosened the other three and tried them all again and the fourth bolt was successfully tightened. The two spacewalkers helped guide the SSRMS to temporarily stow the old ATA on the truss structure. The new ATA had its electrical connections made, but the fluid connections were deferred until the third spacewalk since the EVA was behind the time-line. Mastracchio and Anderson also installed two radiator grapple fixture stowage beams on the P1 truss. While Anderson and Mastracchio were outside, members of the STS-131 crew continued transferring items from space shuttle Discoverys mid-deck and the MPLM Leonardo. Overall, the crew had completed about half of the transfer work.|$|E

2500|$|The 1971 {{and older}} blocks use a [...] "small" [...] bell housing bolt pattern that is {{exclusive}} to AMC and small Nash sixes. In 1972 the bell housing bolt pattern {{was changed to}} match the AMC V8's - its final use was in 2006 when the 4.0 was phased out. <b>Four</b> <b>bolts</b> on the cylinder block are matched to the transmission bellhousing where an adapter plate serves both as a dust cover - two additional bolt holes on the transmission bellhousing used on the AMC V8 are used to secure the dust cover.

2500|$|All {{aircraft}} in the UH-1 family have similar construction. [...] The UH-1H is the most-produced version, and is representative of all types. The main structure consists of two longitudinal main beams that run under the passenger cabin to the nose {{and back to the}} tail boom attachment point. The main beams are separated by transverse bulkheads and provide the supporting structure for the cabin, landing gear, under-floor fuel tanks, transmission, engine and tail boom. The main beams are joined at the lift beam, a short aluminum girder structure that is attached to the transmission via a lift link on the top and the cargo hook on the bottom and is located at the aircraft's center of gravity. The lift beams were changed to steel later in the UH-1H's life, due to cracking on high-time airframes. The semi-monocoque tail boom attaches to the fuselage with <b>four</b> <b>bolts.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The ceding of Petsamo from Finland to the Soviet Union had {{no effect}} on the border, as the Soviet Union by default {{inherits}} the old border line. A common commission was created to the review the border, with negotiations taking place from 1 to 16 August 1946. The field review took place between 1 July and 4 September 1947. Norway initially proposed using cairns to mark the border, but the Soviet Union wanted to use the same method as along its other borders, with wooden markers, each [...] from the border line. There was to be a free line of sight from each pair of markers to the next. The idea initially met resistance from Norwegian authorities of cost reasons, but they soon agreed on the principle to reduce unintentional border crossings. Markers in soil were dug down [...] and markers on bedrock were fastened with <b>four</b> <b>bolts.</b> Border checkpoints were established at Skafferhullet and Boris Gleb. Geodesic measurements were undertaken to establish the border in accordance with the Bessel ellipsoid. The entire border area was mapped in 1:20,000.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{motorcycle}} show in November 1951, Sharp's announced what they described as [...] "a revolutionary {{design in the}} field of commercial vehicles". [...] The Sharp's Commercial 3 Cwt took the concept of the Minicar's light, three-wheeled, utilitarian design, and adapted it as the basis for an open-top lightweight industrial vehicle. The yellow and black prototype at the show was powered by an Indian Brave [...] four-stroke side valve engine (supplied by Brockhouse Engineering Co., Southport) and mounted in a cradle ahead and above the front wheel. Though described as [...] "constructed on the stressed-skin principle", large cut outs to allow easy access from either side of the vehicle required much additional strengthening to the floor, with a central steel backbone girder, a cross member between the rear wheels and further triangular bracing. The single seat was located centrally as was the steering wheel. Steering was by worm and sector, and flared side panels allowed the single front wheel to turn a full 180°, making the vehicle extremely manoeuvrable. The entire engine, drive-train and steering unit could be removed by undoing <b>four</b> <b>bolts</b> to allow for easy servicing. Unlike the Minicar, there were brakes on all three wheels and there was a wooden-slatted floor behind the driver. Though the Sharp's Commercial never entered production, it served as a forerunner to van and pickup versions of the Mark B which appeared in 1952.|$|E
2500|$|The {{flight data}} {{recorder}} (FDR) was an antiquated analog model which used metal foil strips scratched by moving pins. Here, it did not record vertical acceleration readings and misrecorded heading indications. One needle recorded some lines twice, initially confusing the investigators, leading the team to send the FDR to the American company which manufactured it. The manufacturer asked an ex-employee, the highest expert regarding the company's {{flight data recorder}}s, to temporarily leave retirement to examine the recorder. The expert concluded that the needle {{supposed to have been}} recording the altitude had been shaking so much that it left other stray marks on the foil. This particular FDR was able to record for hundreds of hours; further investigations found that the needle had been shaking abnormally for months. This told investigators that another component, not just the APU with the broken mount, had also been vibrating. The investigators charted the vibrations and found that two months before the crash, the vibrations stopped for two weeks, since during that period the aircraft received a major overhaul in Canada by the airline's previous owner. Afterward, the vibrations increased up to the accident flight. During the Canadian company's test flights of the aircraft and its first several passenger flights for Partnair, the FDR recorded almost no abnormal vibrations. A review of the maintenance records of the aircraft revealed that during the overhaul, the mechanic discovered wear on one of the <b>four</b> <b>bolts</b> and sleeves that held the vertical fin and fuselage together and replaced them. The vibrations stopped after the parts were replaced, but gradually worsened afterwards.|$|E

The fuel filler neck was moved from inside the trunk to the right front quarter panel, just above the fender. Inside, a matte black padded dashboard was introduced, resulting in greater comfort and less eye fatigue. The wiper/washer control was also moved from a button on the dashboard to a lever on the right of the steering column. Later that year, additional improvements appeared, including a four-spoke black steering wheel.|$|R
