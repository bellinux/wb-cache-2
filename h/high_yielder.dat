A {{wide range of}} variation was found in twelve quantitative plant traits. The most important correlations corresponded to eight plant traits. Considering these traits, PCA could explain 76. 2 % of total variance. Based on cluster analysis, the genotypes were grouped into seven clusters, each cluster with greater similarities. Plant height, days to flowering and pods plant- 1 were the discriminating variables mostly contributed in grouping the genotypes. Pods plant- 1 played the most dominant role in explaining the maximum variance according to DFA.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{is described in}} which the nutritive value of greenfeed maize {{as a supplement to}} lactating dairy cows during the Summer dry period was investigated. Forty Spring calving Friesian cows were allocated to one of two treatments in a randomised block design experiment. One group of 20 cows was fed on grazed pasture alone (control) on a separate 7. 96 ha farmlet while the other group of 20 cows was fed a supplement of greenfeed maize in addition to the pasture from a 7. 75 ha farmlet. The farmlets of both groups were divided into 7 paddocks and the cows were rotationally grazed. A 1 week standardisation period was followed by a 5 week experimental period. The herbage present on both farmlets was estimated {{at the beginning of the}} experiment and, during the experiment, estimates of of the pasture remaining after grazing were made which gave an indication of the grazing intensity. Two crops of greenfeed maize were fed, Crop A and Crop B. Crop A had a low yield of D M, poor plant density and a high weed population. Crop B had a high plant population with thin stalks and few weeds. Mean daily milk, milk fat, milk protein yields and liveweights were not significantly different between groups. There were significant differences between the slopes of the regression lines relating pretrial to experimental milk yields (P< 0. 01) and milk protein yield (P< 0. 05) of the two groups. There were significant differences (P< 0. 10) between the slopes of the regression lines of milk yield against time of the two groups and between the low yielders of each group but no significant difference between the <b>high</b> <b>yielders</b> of each group. The control group maintained their liveweight during the first half of the trial and lost weight in the second half of the trial. The maize group lost weight initially then increased steadily in liveweight. However, the differences in mean liveweight between groups were not statistically significant. The <b>high</b> <b>yielders</b> lost more weight in the second half of the trial than the low yielders in the control group. It would appear that, while the overall differences in the mean daily milk yields between groups were too small to be statistically significant, the milk yield of the control group declined at a faster rate than the maize group with the low yielders in the control group declining at the fastest rate. The weight lost by the <b>high</b> <b>yielders</b> in the control group was slightly greater than that of the low yielders in the same group. The <b>high</b> <b>yielders</b> in the control group maintained their rate of decline in milk yield similar to that of the supplemented group and this was probably achieved by a greater reduction in liveweight relative to the low yielders. The yield of Crop B was 11, 008 kg D M /ha and the digestibility varied from 71. 2 - 75. 4 % of the 0 M. Maize intake was 3. 0 and 3. 5 kg/DM/cow/day and utilisation 76. 5 and 82. 1 % of the D M for Crops A and B respectively. The control group completed two rotations on their farmlet with rotation lengths of 19 and 12 days. At the end of the experiment they were very short of pasture. The maize group had completed one rotation in 26 days and had grazed 1. 1 ha for a second time. They had adequate supplies of herbage at the end of the experiment.

The developed separation scheme comprised five consecutive steps: (1) incineration of the contaminated biomass; (2) microwave acid (HCl) digestion of the ashes; (3) recovery of copper from the acid solution by electrolysis at controlled potential; (4) recycle of nickel, as nickel hydroxide, by alcalinization of the previous solution at pH 14; (5) recovery of zinc, as zinc hydroxide, by adjusting the pH of the previous solution at 10. This integrated approach allowed recovering each metal with <b>high</b> <b>yielder</b> (> 99 % for all metals) and purity (99. 9 %, 92 % and 99. 4 % for copper, nickel and zinc, respectively).

The aim {{of the study was}} to determine genetic variability and trends of genetic progress in agronomic and end-use quality traits and assess stability and association between characters if there were changes over time. Thirty cultivars including 5 historically important ancestors released from 1784 to 2000 were evaluated under rain-fed conditions at Lincoln, Mead and North Platte in 2002 and 2003 seasons using alpha lattice design with 45 incomplete blocks of two plots. Modern cultivars were <b>high</b> <b>yielder,</b> highly responsive to environments and less stable for grain yield and its components when compared to older lines. Older cultivars showed more response than modern cultivars for days to flowering and plant height. Breeders have selected lines for higher grain yield and spike productivity, earliness, shorter height, higher flour yield, longer mixing time and mixing tolerance. ^ Chapter II focused on the comparison of genetic diversity estimates using different methods in the same cultivars. The study objectives were to (1) determine the genetic diversity among had red winter wheat cultivars adapted to the Northern Great Plains using pedigree information, morphological traits, end-use quality attributes and molecular markers and (2) examine the association of genetic distance estimates obtained from these methods. Genetic diversity was estimated based pedigree history, morphological traits and end-use quality traits, seed storage proteins, 51 SSRs and 23 SRAPs. Molecular markers showed that pedigree analysis had overestimated genetic distance between cultivars due to unrealistic assumptions. All distance estimates were positively interrelated. Highly significant positive correlation of distance estimates from morphological traits with all other method showed relation of morphological diversity with end-use quality and molecular markers diversity. Highly significant positive correlation between molecular markers-based distances estimates shows that molecular markers could explain similar genetic variability among cultivars. Relatively, clustering based on SSR markers and morphology grouped most cultivars in agreement with pedigree history. ...|$|E

The differences between genotypic coefficient of variation (GCV) and the phenotypic coefficient of variation (PCV) were low for all the characters, indicated a low environmental influence over genetic factors on the characters. The GCV and PCV were generally high for pods/plant, 100 -seed weight, duration of flowering, seeds/pod and seed yield/plant. High heritability coupled with high genetic advance was observed for duration of flowering, pods/plant, 100 -seed weight, seed yield/plant and protein content. Days to 50 % flowering, duration of flowering, plant height, pods/plant and seeds/pod had high degree of significant positive correlation with seed yield/plant. Path analysis indicated that pods/plant, days to 50 % flowering, 100 -seed weight, seeds/pod, plant height and pod length had positive direct effect on seed yield/plant. Those traits could, therefore, be of useful for yield imporovement program of bush bean. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a first attempt at {{evaluating}} the determinants of the total interest rate differentials on government bonds between <b>high</b> <b>yielders,</b> namely Italy, Spain, Sweden and Germany. In particular we {{address the question of}} the relative importance of local and global factors in the determination of such spreads. We identify and measure two components of total yield differentials: one due to expectations of exchange rate depreciation [...] which we call the exchange rate factor [...] another which reflects the market assessment of default risk. We propose and discuss a measure of the exchange rate factors and of the default risk premium based on interest rate swaps. Overall our investigation provides strong evidence in favor of the existence of a common trend for the Italian and Spanish spreads on Bunds, which is not shared by the Swedish spread. Such a trend is driven by international factors and is independent from country- specific shocks. Country-specific shocks are only relevant in explaining short term cycles around the common stochastic trend. ...|$|R

To combat this natural calamity,one hundred spring wheat genotypes were assessed for heat stress tolerance under plastic sheet tunnel resulting in seven parents with varied heat stress tolerance. The seven parents including tolerant, moderately tolerant and susceptible but <b>high</b> <b>yielders</b> were later hybridized in a 7 × 7 diallel fashion. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences for all the studied traits. The heterosis and heterobeltiosis estimates revealed that thereisdesirable hybrid vigor in the current studies for all the traits evaluated. For grain yield maximum heterosis of 28. 70 % under normal and 27. 02 % under heat stress conditions were observed. Regarding heterobeltiosis it remained at 15. 58 % under normal and 13. 62 % under heat stress conditions. Similarly desirable negative results were obtained for relative cell injury%, days to heading and maturity and positive significant heterosis and heterobeltiosis was obtained for flag leaf area, biomass per plantand harvest index%.

40|$|Field {{experiments}} were {{conducted during the}} main rainy seasons of 2009 and 2010 at three rainfed upland locations of Southwest Ethiopia to evaluate and select high yielding NERICA genotypes. A total of fourteen rice genotypes consisting of 9 NERICA, 3 FOFIFA and 2 genotypes as check, laid down in a randomized complete block design with three replications were used as treatments. The study revealed highly significant (p - 1) and Gomma- 2 (4262. 2 and 3915. 6 kg ha - 1). At Eladale, the local check (X-Jigna) was with the <b>highest</b> <b>yielder</b> (1080 kg ha - 1). Among NERICA genotypes tested, 77 % of them recorded 5 - 6 tons of grain yields per hectare at Shebe. Performance of all genotypes increased sharply with decrease in altitude from Eladale to Shebe and vice versa. Mean grain yield advantage of 20 - 23 % was achieved by NERICA 4 and NERICA 3 over check genotypes at Shebe. The two NERICA varieties were recommended for rice producing farmers with an altitude range of below 1500 m a. s. l. to maximize grain yields in Southwest Ethiopia...|$|R
40|$|The present {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to identify high yielding wheat genotypes for target environments and establish relationship between carbon isotope discrimination (Δ), grain yield (GY) and water use efficiency (WUE), and other parameters. A set of eight wheat genotypes screened previously for variation in Δ and higher GY were grown under four water regimes; well-watered (WW), medium-watered (MW), low-watered (LW) and stored soil moisture (SSM) conditions. Early leaf and grain samples collected at maturity were analysed for Δ. Plant parameters, such as number of tillers (NT), plant height (PH) heading days (HD), and maturity days (MD) were recorded. At harvesting spike length (SL), number of grains per spike (NGPS), thousand grains weight (TGW), biomass yield (BY), GY, harvest index (HI) and WUE on biomass basis (WUEB) and grain basis (WUEG) were determined. Significant effects of genotype and treatments on Δ of leaf (L) and grain (ΔG), BY, GY, HI, WUEB, WUEG, HD, NT, PH, NGPS, TGW and SL were observed. Genotype x treatment interaction {{had a significant effect}} on HI, PH, SL, TGW, HD and MD, but the effect was non-significant on other traits. In all these genotypes L and ΔG showed a variation of 1. 3 and 0. 91 ‰, respectively. All genotypes exhibited higher L than ΔG under different water regimes. Water stress reduced both L and ΔG and highly significant correlation (0. 946 **) was found between L and ΔG. GY showed a wide variation among these genotypes and water stress resulted in a marked decrease in GY. Genotype Sitta produced highest mean GY (4. 4 Mg ha- 1) with highest WUEG (16. 99 kg ha- 1 mm- 1) averaged across the treatment. GY showed significant positive correlations with L (r= 0. 779 *) and ΔG (r= 0. 753 *). GY was also strongly and positively correlated with HI (r= 0. 845 **), SL (r= 0. 779 **) and TGW (r= 0. 899 **). GY had a significant negative correlation with NT (r=- 0. 884 *) and HD (r=- 0. 708 *). WUEG was positively correlated with L (r= 0. 846 *), ΔG (0. 707 *), HI (r= 0. 846 **), SL (r= 0. 784 *), TGW (r= 0. 892 **). WUEG was negatively correlated with NT (r=- 0. 814 *) and HD (r= - 0. 743 *). Sitta and FD- 83 genotypes were found <b>high</b> <b>yielder</b> with greater increase in WUE under water stress and can be exploited to obtain high GY in rain-fed and water limited environments of the country. The results highlight significant positive correlations between Δ and GY or WUEG in bread wheat and carbon isotope discrimination as indirect selection criterion for grain yield in Pakistan...|$|E
40|$|Fifty {{inbred lines}} of maize {{acquired}} from various sources, were screened in the wirehouse for seedling traits under both normal and water deficit conditions. Six inbred lines were earmarked {{on the basis}} of various agronomic and physiological traits under water deficit condition. The inbred lines were sown in the field for making all possible crosses in diallel mating fashion. The F 1 crosses and their reciprocals alongwith the parents were sown in the field under normal and water stress environment using Randomized Complete Block Design in three replications. Normal irrigations were applied to one set of experiment, whereas 50 % of the normal irrigation was applied to water stress experiment. Data for various morpho-physiological characters were recorded at different growth stages of the crop and then subjected to statistical analysis. Co-efficient of variability was found to be greater under water stress than under normal condition for majority of the seedling traits. Significant mean squares for all the parameters under normal and moisture deficit conditions depicted the presence of considerable genetic variability. Scaling tests were performed to check the adequacy of the data for analyzing additive-dominance model. The results showed that additive-dominance model was fully adequate for the traits like kernels per row, 100 -kernel weight, grain yield per plant, cell membrane thermostability, stomatal conductance and canopy temperature under normal condition while plant height, ear height, days to silking, kernels per ear, 100 -kernel weight, grain yield per plant, leaf temperature and canopy temperature depression under water stress condition. The data were partially adequate for the traits like ears per plant, days to tasselling, anthesis-silking interval, kernels per row, cell membrane thermostability and stomatal conductance under moisture deficit condition. Additive gene action for number of days to silking under normal water condition changed to non-additive gene action under water deficit condition. All other traits exhibited additive gene action under both conditions. Heritability estimates for yield related traits revealed maximum ability to transfer the desirable genes to the next generation. Estimation of components of variation exhibited greater estimates for GCA variance (б 2 g) than SCA variance (б 2 s) for majority of the traits under both conditions depicting the predominant role of additive genetic component except for days to silking and number of kernels per row under water deficit condition which displayed greater SCA variance (б 2 s) than GCA variance (б 2 g). Under water stress condition, the best performing crosses were NCIL- 20 - 20 x D- 109, NCIL- 20 - 20 x OH- 8 and D- 114 x NCIL- 20 - 20 and their reciprocals. Inbred lines NCIL- 20 - 20, D- 157 and D- 114 proved to be <b>high</b> <b>yielder</b> parents under both normal and moisture deficit conditions. The information regarding results obtained during the current study may be used to evolve better parental inbred lines for developing various cross combinations which will be helpfull in maintaining yield sustainability in water deficit areas...|$|E
40|$|Um grupo de 67 conjuntos de cafeeiros procedentes do Departamento de Agricultura dos Estados Unidos foi recebido, em 1953, em Campinas. Destes conjuntos, 8 são oriundos da Etiópia, aí coletados por P. Sylvain, 10 de Tanganica e Quênia, porém de origem etiope, 11 correspondem a seleções da Índia, 24 de Tanganica, 10 de Quênia, 1 da Congo e 3 do Sudão². Em vista do número variável de plantas por conjunto, foram êles plantados em Campinas em dois ensaios comparativos, tendo como testemunhas linhagens selecionadas dos cultivares 'Bourbon Vermelho' 'Bourbon Amarelo' e 'Mundo Novo'. Analisaram-se o desenvolvimento dos cafeeiros, o seu vigor vegetativo, produção total de café cereja em cinco anos, tipos de sementes produzidas, tamanho das sementes do tipo chato e ocorrência de frutos com lojas sem sementes, fazendo-se referência especial aos conjuntos da Etiópia e do Sudão. Notou-se acentuada variabilidade no que {{concerne}} a êstas características nos conjuntos de procedência etiope. Assim, quanto à altura média dos cofeeifos, 8 conjuntos mostraram-se bem crescidos e 10 deram altura mais reduzida e, quanto ao vigor, apenas 5 conjuntos revelaram-se promissores. Dentre êstes, os de melhor aspecto vegetativo são o café 'Harar', 'Amfillo', 'Dalle Mixed' e 'Dilla' e, o pior deles, o 'Ennarea'. Os três conjuntos do Sudão não apresentam bom aspecto vegetativo. Quanto à produção, os conjuntos 'Harar', 'Tafari Kela', 'Gimma Tana, 'Amfillo', 'Dilla & Alghe' mostraram-se produtivos, enquanto o 'Ennarea', 'Mattu', 'Gimma Galla Sidamo', 'Gimma Mbuni' deram as piores produções dos ensaios, indicando a sua falta de adaptação ao nosso meio. Também os cafés do Sudão mostraram-se pouco produtivos. O conjunto 'Harar', além de ter produção comparável ao melhor testemunha do ensaio, encerro algumas plantas com maturação dos frutos tardia, de certo interêsse no plano de melhoramento. Notou-se também acentuada variação no comportamento das seleções do Quênia e Tanganica, mostrando-se algumas promissoras e outras reduzidas. Quase todas as seleções da Índia, ao contrário, comportaram-se mal. As porcentagens de semente do tipo chato revelaram-se abaixo de 80 por cento em 9 dos 18 conjuntos da Etiópia e apenas os cultivares 'Harar', 'Dalle Mixed' e 'Erithean Moca' deram quantidades maiores destas sementes. Os três conjuntos do Sudão deram porcentagem abaixo de 80. As do tipo moca atingiram porcentagens elevadas, acima de 15 por cento, em 14 dos 18 conjuntos, enquanto as do tipo concha são em quantidades normais em 15 conjuntos, sendo mais elevadas no café 'Ennaera' e 'Dilla'. Os três conjuntos do Sudão têm elevada quantidade de sementes do tipo moca e baixa quantidade de sementes do tipo concha. O tamanho dos grãos do tipo chato mostrou-se favorável em cinco conjuntos, sendo que o 'Harar' tem peneira das mais altas. Os dados mostraram que o aproveitamento dêste material da Etiópia poderá ser feito sòmente mediante seleção para tipos de sementes normais. O conjunto da Índia revelaram-se os menos promissores no que se refere às porcentagens de sementes do tipo chato. A constatação da ocorrência de plantas com elevada quantidade de frutos chochos, sem sementes, mostrou que o defeito ocorre em alguns conjuntos da Etiópia, Tanganica, Quênia e particulamente na Índia. A análise morfológica efetuada indicou que os conjuntos 'Harar', 'Gimma Tana', 'Ennaera', 'Tafari Kela', 'Agaro' e 'Gimma Mbuni' devem constituir variedades botânicas novas e que os cafés 'Harar', 'Tafari Kela', 'Amfillo', 'Dilla' e 'Dilla & Alghe' são promissores, podendo de ser utilizados no plano de melhoramentos em execução em Campinas. After a {{very thorough}} quarantine examination, the Plant Introduction Division of U. S. Department of Agriculture sent to Campinas, in 1953, 67 groups of coffee seedlings, developed from seeds obtained in various African coffee regions and from India. Eight {{out of the}} 67 groups of seedlings come directly from Etiópia, where they were collected by Sylvain; 10 from Tanganyka and Kenya but of Ethiopian origin; 16 from selected strains of India, 24 from Tanganyika, 10 from Kenya, 3 from Sudan and 1 from Congo. Two experiments to study the yield variability of these groups, were established with these seedlings in Campinas using selected strains of the cultivars 'Mundo Novo', 'Bourbon Amarelo' and 'Bourbon Vermelho', for yield comparison. The groups from Ethiopia reacted very differently to our condition. From these 18 groups, 8 revealed good average plant height and 10 groups showed very poor development. The groups introduced are not well adapted since only 'Harar', 'Amfillo', 'Dalle Mixed' and 'Dilla' presented good vegetative vigor. The 'Ennarea' group was the weakest. All three groups from Sudan have not developed well in Campinas. The analysis of the total weight of cherries produced {{in the last five}} years pointed out that among the Ethiopian groups 'Harar', 'Tafari Kela', 'Gimma Tana' 'Amfillo' and 'Dilla & Alghe' are good yielders, white the 'Ennarea', 'Mattu', 'Gimma Gallo Sidamo' and 'Gimma Mbuni', had the lowest yields in the experiments. Besides being a <b>high</b> <b>yielder,</b> the 'Harar' group contains a few late maturing plants which are of interest to our coffee breeding program. The group of Sudan gave very poor yield. Considerable variation was also observed among the selections from Tonganyka and Kenya, a few of them being promising due to the high yield. Most of the Indian selections are very poor yielders. Percentages of flat beans lower than 80 per cent, were found in 9 of the 18 Ethiopian groups, the 'Harar', 'Dalle Mixed' and 'Erithreon Moca' being the only groups with a good percentage of these normal beans. Peaberry type of seeds in proportion higher than 15 per cent were observed in 14 of the 18 Ethiopian groups, while the percentage of the abnormal elephant-beans (shell beans) is higher only in the groups 'Ennarea' and 'Dilla'. The three groups from Sudan gave low flat bean percentages and high amount of peaberry type of seeds. The size of the flat beans is considered good in 5 of the 18 groups, the 'Harar' group having large normal flat seeds. The plants of Ethiopion origin must be submitted to an intensive selection for high percentage of large flat beans, before being used in our coffee breeding program. The Indian groups are the least promising ones, having given very low flat bean percentages. The incidence of plants possessing high number of cherries with empty locules indicated the occurrence of this seed defect in coffee plants from Ethiopia, Tanganyika, Kenya and particularly from India. Differences in the morphological characteristics of the Ethiopian coffee pointed out that at least the 'Harar', 'Gimmo Tana', 'Ennarea', 'Tafari Kela', 'Agoro', and 'Gimma Mbuni', may be considered as new botanical varieties of Coffea arabica. The 'Harar', 'Tafari Kela', 'Amfillo', 'Dilla' and 'Dilla & Alghe' are promising material for breeding purposes. Some of their representatives can be used directly in the development of new progenies or in hybridization with coffee strains, which have been selected in Campinas...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a highly client-oriented breeding applied {{to enhance the}} development and release of a tef (Eragrostis tef) variety with farmer participation in Ethiopia. The main features include; clear objective, target cross, early-stage researcher selection, multi-location yield trial, farmer on-station selection, judicious selection of few candidate varieties based on farmers' and researchers' selections, farmer managed on-farm trials, and release through the existing formal procedure. In the application of this strategy, tef exemplifies a crop with local importance, a clear market-driven selection criterion (cash crop) and farmers have better judgment of the criterion than researchers. Using farmers' consistent selection of genotypes, {{in conjunction with the}} required quantifiable data, breeders were able to release a new tef variety named "Quncho". The new variety was not the <b>highest</b> <b>yielder,</b> but it was higher in grain yield and better in seed-color quality (very white seed-color) than the long-time cultivated variety DZ- 01 - 196 (Magna), which was used as quality check. Given the appropriate degree of client-orientation, the results also show how farmer participation and formal breeding programs complement each other so as to overcome the rather prohibitive variety release procedures based on data from participatory breeding alone.

The design lay out was a randomized blocks design with threereplications. The additive main effects and multiplicative interactions (AMMI) analysis indicated that the grain yieldperformance of maize genotypes were mainly due to genotypes and environmental interaction. The first two principalcomponent axis (IPCA I and IPCA II) were significant (p< 0. 01) and cumulatively contributed to entire degrees of freedomavailable for interaction component.
