500|$|Several of {{the scenes}} {{were based on the}} actor's real-life talents as well as improvised. When Michael tells Pam to [...] "write this down", Jenna Fischer's {{response}} to the camera was improvised. [...] "I thought it was funny that I didn't have a pad of paper but Michael was telling me to take notes," [...] she explained in her MySpace blog, [...] "so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> to the camera and showed my lack of pen and paper." [...] Jim's impression of Stanley in this episode was inspired by John Krasinski's actual talent of doing impressions on the set.|$|E

It {{was covered with a}} blanket, and when it was pulled back, I saw there was no head on the corpse — just an {{incredibly}} bloody mess on the neck. Someone told me that the skull {{was on the other side}} of the gully and asked if I wanted to see that. But I said, [...] "No, I've pretty much got this story." [...] They looked like older men, with gray hair or white hair ... They had wounds on their heads, and there was blood on their clothes. [...] I didn't count them. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> and saw a lot of holes in the head - in the top of the head and the back of the head. A couple had what appeared to be bullet wounds knocking out their eyes. I was told there were other bodies further up and over the crest of the hill, and I was asked by journalists and inspectors if I was going to go up and see the rest. I said, 'I've seen enough.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{are really}} very kind," [...] he said. [...] "I {{should like to}} come up and see the Hall, at any rate, but in the meantime, as we are here, could <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> over the inside of this little place? I found the large shed where the {{lifeboat}} used to be kept, locked up." ...|$|R
50|$|For The Andy Griffith Show, Peterson {{initially}} {{read for}} the role of love interest for Sheriff Andy Taylor, but the role went to Elinor Donahue (Ellie Walker). Soon after, she was selected {{to play the role of}} Charlene Darling. The only daughter of Briscoe Darling, she had a crush on Sheriff Taylor ("Pa, can't <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> at the pretty man?").|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hullo!' bawled Blockhead-Hans, 'here <b>I</b> am! <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> what <b>I</b> {{found on}} the road!'--and he showed them a dead crow which he had picked up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Chief's {{gone to the}} Palace--no {{one knows}} why. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> in because I met a woman the other day whom Ansell says you know {{something}} about--Baroness von Haase." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not in here, my Lord. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> {{in at the}} smoking-room last night. Glasslough and Nidderdale were there. I {{thought we}} should have got up a rubber, but they didn't seem to see it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> at him--coolly, you know, {{and looked}} at her. Then I {{looked back at him}} again--taking my time, you know. 'I don't think that that's a fair {{question}} to put to me,' says I." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Martha," [...] he said, [...] "I'm goin' off now {{to attend}} to my business, but I haven't made a rap yet to-day, and its hard working on a empty stomach, so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> in to light my pipe, and enquire if you hadn't got a shillin' about you, eh!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very {{sorry to}} have {{disturbed}} you, Mr. Samuel. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> in to say good-bye. I sail on Saturday, and my time will be pretty fully taken up all the week. I {{have to go down}} to the country to get some final instructions from the client whose important papers I am taking over. I'm {{sorry to have}} missed your father, Mr. Samuel." ...|$|E

5000|$|I did Rihannas song “SOS,” and {{it wasnt}} her first song, {{but it was}} her first number one. Since then, shes {{obviously}} one of the biggest stars in the world. But I never look at it like thats because of me or something like that. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> at it like it was amazing to have worked with her at that time, and I would like to work with her again.|$|R

6000|$|... "This," [...] Sylvanus Power declared, {{striking}} the desk with his clenched fist. [...] "I have {{only had one}} consolation all the time I have been waiting--there has been no other man. Elizabeth isn't that sort. Each time I was separated and came back, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> at her and I knew. That's why I have been patient. That is why I haven't insisted upon my debt being paid. You understand that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, yes; I {{remember}} now. You have parted. The {{subject is}} too large {{for me to know}} all at once what I think of it, and you must give me time, Kit. Speaking of Ethelberta reminds me of what I have done. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> into the Academy this morning--I thought I would surprise you by telling you about it. And what do you think I saw? Ethelberta--in the picture painted by Mr. Ladywell.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much. 'You've got the Pontiac, Nott,' sez he. 'You bet!' sez I. 'What'll {{you take}} {{for her and}} the lot she stands on?' sez he, short and sharp. Some fellers, Rosey," [...] said Nott, with a cunning smile, [...] "would hev blurted out a big figger and been cotched. That ain't my style. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> at him.

5000|$|Bachmann’s poems {{grabbed me}} because of their {{violence}}—was <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> for it?—but it was a violence which was often implied, a sense of foreboding, a mood often just beneath the surface, rather than Wertmuller’s horrifying image {{of a family of}} ten being gunned down in a mass grave. And it’s not that I don’t like Wertmuller’s films—I do. I guess this particular evening <b>I</b> <b>just</b> wanted the striptease, not the naked body; the faint hint of heat, not the bottle of Tabasco. - D.A. Powell ...|$|R

6000|$|I moved {{accordingly}} to {{the other}} side of that big room. The garniture was very fine. But while pretending to examine it I watched my man going forward to meet a tall visitor, who said, [...] "I thought you would be disengaged so early. It's only a word or two"--and after a whispered confabulation of no more than a minute, reconduct him to the door and shake hands ceremoniously. [...] "Not at all, not at all. Very pleased to be of use. You can depend absolutely on my information"--"Oh thank you, thank you. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tried to}} work this morning," [...] he declared. [...] "I gave up simply because I found myself {{thinking}} of you all the time. Genius is so susceptible to diversions. This afternoon I couldn't settle down because I was wondering all the time whether you were wearing blue linen or white muslin. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> {{out of the window}} to see--you were asleep in the hammock [...] . you witch!" [...] he murmured softly. [...] "How could I keep sane and collected! How could I write about anybody or anything in the world except you! The wind was blowing those little strands of hair over your face. Your left arm was hanging down--so; why is an arm such a graceful thing, I wonder? Your left knee was drawn up--you had been supporting a book against it and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{know what}} she was saying. I meant to tell you, Marilla, {{honestly}} I did, but I forgot. Miss Stacy caught me reading Ben Hur in school yesterday afternoon when I should have been studying my Canadian history. Jane Andrews lent it to me. I was reading it at dinner hour, and I had just got to the chariot race when school went in. I was simply wild to know how it turned out--although I felt sure Ben Hur must win, because it wouldn't be poetical justice if he didn't--so I spread the history open on my desk lid and then tucked Ben Hur between the desk and my knee. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> as if I were studying Canadian history, you know, while all the while I was reveling in Ben Hur. I was so interested in it that I never noticed Miss Stacy coming down the aisle until all at once <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> up and there she was looking down at me, so reproachful-like. I can't tell you how ashamed I felt, Marilla, especially when I heard Josie Pye giggling. Miss Stacy took Ben Hur away, but she never said a word then. She kept me in at recess and talked to me. She said I had done very wrong in two respects. First, I was wasting the time I ought to have put on my studies; and secondly, I was deceiving my teacher in trying to make it appear I was reading a history when it was a storybook instead. I had never realized until that moment, Marilla, that what I was doing was deceitful. I was shocked. I cried bitterly, and asked Miss Stacy to forgive me and I'd never do such a thing again; and I offered to do penance by never so much as looking at Ben Hur for a whole week, not even to see how the chariot race turned out. But Miss Stacy said she wouldn't require that, and she forgave me freely. So I think it wasn't very kind of her to come up here to you about it after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, no," [...] {{said the}} Kid gently, [...] "I reckon not. I {{never saw it}} before. <b>I</b> was <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> at it. Not {{thinking}} of selling it, are you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop a moment," [...] {{he said to}} his friend. [...] "Don't be afraid, I'm {{not going}} to pay. But, <b>I</b> say, <b>just</b> <b>look</b> at her eyes--good eyes, aren't they?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But they're {{a pretty}} uppish sort, most of 'em," [...] {{he said to}} Saxon, {{referring}} to the persons he drove. [...] "Always MISTER Roberts this, an' MISTER Roberts that--all kinds of ceremony {{so as to make}} me not forget they consider themselves better 'n me. You see, I ain't exactly a servant, an' yet I ain't good enough for them. I'm the driver--something half way between a hired man and a chauffeur. Huh! When they eat they give me my lunch off to one side, or afterward. No family party like with Hall an' HIS kind. An' that crowd to-day, why, they just naturally didn't have no lunch for me at all. After this, always, you make me up my own lunch. I won't be be holdin' to 'em for nothin', the damned geezers. An' you'd a-died to seen one of 'em try to give me a tip. I didn't say nothin'. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> at 'm like I didn't see 'm, an' turned away casual-like after a moment, leavin' him as embarrassed as hell." ...|$|E
60|$|BLANCO [Forcibly] No: {{thats where}} youre wrong. Dont flatter yourselves that youre miserable sinners. Am I a miserable sinner? No: I'm a fraud and a failure. I started {{in to be}} a bad man like the rest of you. You all started in to be bad men or you wouldn't be in this jumped-up, jerked-off, hospital-turned-out camp that calls itself a town. I took the broad path because I thought I was a man and not a snivelling canting turning-the-other-cheek {{apprentice}} angel serving his time in a vale of tears. They talked Christianity to us on Sundays; but when they really meant business they told us never to take a blow without giving it back, and to get dollars. When they talked the golden rule to me, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> at them as if they werent there, and spat. But when they told me to try to live my life so that I could always look my fellowman straight in the eye and tell him to go to hell, that fetched me.|$|E

'We {{passed through}} Evershead as we came,' he continued, 'and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> {{in at the}} [...] "Sow-and-Acorn" [...] to see if old Mike still kept on there as usual. The carrier had come in from Sherton Abbas at that moment, and {{guessing}} that I was bound for this place--for I think he knew me--he asked me to bring on a dressmaker's parcel for Sally that was marked [...] "immediate." [...] My wife had walked on with the children. 'Twas a flimsy parcel, and the paper was torn, and I found on looking at it {{that it was a}} thick warm gown. I didn't wish you to see poor Helena in a shabby state. I was ashamed that you should--'twas not what she was born to. I untied the parcel in the road, took it on to her where she was waiting in the Lower Barn, and told her I had managed to get it for her, and that she was to ask no question. She, poor thing, must have supposed I obtained it on trust, through having reached a place where I was known, for she put it on gladly enough. She has it on now. Sally has other gowns, I daresay.' ...|$|E
