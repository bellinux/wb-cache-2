5|$|The {{goal of this}} {{approach}} is twofold: to enable deeper inspection of the code at compile time to identify additional opportunities for parallel execution, and to simplify processor design and reduce energy consumption by <b>eliminating</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> runtime scheduling circuitry.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{where an}} MP {{of the ruling}} party vacates his or her seat, a {{counterpart}} in a neighbouring ward may take over his or her functions, thus <b>eliminating</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a by-election. However, this arrangement may not work if an opposition MP vacates his or her seat and no by-election is called, because of the dearth of opposition MPs in Parliament. Therefore, the voters in the opposition ward will be denied of representation until the next general election.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the quantum aspects of gravity in our four-dimensional universe, some physicists have considered a lower-dimensional mathematical model in which spacetime has only two spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this setting, the mathematics describing the gravitational field simplifies drastically, and one can study quantum gravity using familiar methods from quantum field theory, <b>eliminating</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> string theory or other more radical approaches to quantum gravity in four dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Most enemies will flee at {{the sight}} of the vehicle, <b>eliminating</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> Batman to fight them, and enemies attacking the car can be subdued by its {{automated}} taser defenses. Like Batman, the Batmobile can be upgraded with new abilities. Riddler challenges also feature objectives requiring the Batmobile, such as timed races in tunnels beneath Gotham City, where the environmental obstacles change during each lap, and invisible question marks that must be revealed using the Batmobile's scanner.|$|E
5|$|The United States Air Force {{intended}} to use the Gemini spacecraft to transport astronauts to its proposed space stations, the Manned Orbital Development System and later the Manned Orbital Laboratory (MOL). These stations would have been launched by Titan IIIM rockets, with a Gemini spacecraft atop, <b>eliminating</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> rendezvous and docking maneuvers. For this purpose, several modifications {{were made to the}} Gemini capsule, including the installation of a hatch in the heat shield to allow access to the space station.|$|E

5|$|The {{need for}} the second crewman was an obvious problem with the Mk. XII, {{especially}} as few bombers of the era had enough room for the operator. Working with Henry Braddick, Blackett developed {{a new version of}} the calculator that included aircraft instruments inside the computor, <b>eliminating</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the needle-on-needle matching and completely automating the calculations. After the initial design was complete, Blackett moved onto other matters with RAF Coastal Command, where he continued development of his theories of operational research.|$|E
5|$|To expand {{upon the}} concept of Reserve {{component}} and National Guard components, the First Army activated Division East and Division West, two commands responsible for reserve units' readiness and mobilization exercises. Division East activated at Fort Riley. This transformation {{was part of an}} overall restructuring of the US Army to streamline the organizations overseeing training. Division East took control of reserve units in states east of the Mississippi River, <b>eliminating</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the 24th Infantry Division headquarters. As such, the 24th Infantry Division was again inactivated on 1 August 2006 at Fort Riley.|$|E

5|$|Beijing {{was elected}} {{as the host}} city for the 2008 Summer Olympics on 13 July 2001, during the 112th IOC Session in Moscow, {{defeating}} bids from Toronto, Paris, Istanbul, and Osaka. Prior to the session, five other cities (Bangkok, Cairo, Havana, Kuala Lumpur, and Seville) had submitted bids to the IOC, but {{failed to make the}} short list chosen by the IOC Executive Committee in 2000. After the first round of voting, Beijing held a significant lead over the other four candidates. Osaka received only six votes and was eliminated. In the second round, Beijing was supported by a majority of voters, <b>eliminating</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> subsequent rounds. Toronto's bid was their 5th failure since 1960 (failed bid for 1960, 1964, 1976 and 1996 games losing to Rome, Tokyo, Montreal and Atlanta).|$|E
5|$|Buoyed by a {{recovering}} {{global economy and}} ETOPS approval, 767 sales accelerated in the mid-to-late 1980s; 1989 was the most prolific year with 132 firm orders. By the early 1990s, the wide-body twinjet had become its manufacturer's annual best-selling aircraft, despite a slight decrease due to economic recession. During this period, the 767 became the most common airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe. By {{the end of the}} decade, 767s crossed the Atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined. The 767 also propelled the growth of point-to-point flights which bypassed major airline hubs in favor of direct routes. Taking advantage of the aircraft's lower operating costs and smaller capacity, operators added non-stop flights to secondary population centers, thereby <b>eliminating</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> connecting flights. The increased number of cities receiving non-stop services caused a paradigm shift in the airline industry as point-to-point travel gained prominence {{at the expense of the}} traditional hub-and-spoke model.|$|E

5|$|The PC {{version of}} Metal Gear Solid was {{released}} in North America, Europe and Asia in late 2000. This version was published by Microsoft Game Studios and developed by Digital Dialect. It supports {{the use of a}} keyboard or a USB game controller with at least six buttons (with the manual recommending the Sidewinder Game Pad Pro). It also supports Direct3D-capable video cards, allowing for a high resolution of up to 1024x768. The PC version is simply labelled Metal Gear Solid on the packaging, but the actual game uses the Metal Gear Solid: Integral logo, although it has some differences as well from the PlayStation version of Integral and lacks some of its content. The biggest change was reducing the number of discs from three to two, which was done by giving each disc two separate executable files, one for the main game (mgsi.exe) and the other for the VR training portion (mgsvr.exe), thus <b>eliminating</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a stand-alone third disc.|$|E
5|$|The main design {{differences}} with the Nclass included the cab front, exhaust arrangements, {{and the addition of}} an extra (inside) cylinder between the frames to drive the centre driving axle. Clayton had revised the layout of the cab front spectacle plates (small windows {{on the front of the}} cab) to improve forward visibility. This incorporated two large single panes of glass either side of the boiler instead of the four smaller windows used on the Nclass. The inside cylinder was to be actuated by Holcroft's design of conjugated valve gear, which consisted of mechanical links fitted to both sets of outside Walschaerts gear, <b>eliminating</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a separate set of valve gear between the frames to operate the inside cylinder. The result would be a reduction in weight and the amount of mechanical equipment located in this inaccessible part of the locomotive.|$|E
5|$|Initially dismayed that Danny {{shot the}} {{only lead to}} Hesse, McGarrett finds Chen Chi (Allison Chu), a smuggled {{immigrant}} from China who was sold to Doran, leading McGarrett to believe human traffickers smuggled Hesse to Hawaii. In order to find out who, McGarrett and Danny turn to Chin Ho Kelly (Daniel Dae Kim), one of John's proteges. He left the Honolulu Police Department disgraced after {{he was accused of}} corruption. After Chin Ho asserts his innocence, McGarrett offers him to join his task force. The trio meet with Chin Ho's friend, former police informant and current owner of a shave ice business Kamekona (Teila Tuli). Kamekona believes the snakehead leader is Sang Min (Will Yun Lee). In order to apprehend Sang Min, Chin Ho decides to appoint his cousin, Kono Kalakaua (Grace Park) as a plant. Kono was a former professional surfer turned police academy graduate. She goes undercover as a Chinese immigrant to meet with Sang Min. The conversation is monitored {{by the rest of the}} team through up-to-date laser audio surveillance, <b>eliminating</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a wire. However, it has emerged that Sang Min has a mole in HPD, who identifies Kono as a cop. The team storm the warehouse, and McGarrett apprehends Sang Min.|$|E
