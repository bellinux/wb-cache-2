50|$|Investigative journalism {{often takes}} an {{implicit}} {{point of view}} on a particular public interest, by asking pointed questions and intensely probing certain questions. With outlets that otherwise strive for neutrality on political issues, the implied position is often uncontroversial—for example that political corruption or abuse of children is wrong and perpetrators should be exposed and punished, that government money should be spent efficiently, or that the health of the public or workers or veterans should be protected. Advocacy journalists often use investigative journalism in support of a particular political position, or to <b>expose</b> <b>facts</b> that are only concerning to those with certain political opinions. Regardless of {{whether or not it is}} undertaken for a specific political faction, this genre usually puts a strong emphasis on factual accuracy, because the point of an in-depth investigation of an issue is to <b>expose</b> <b>facts</b> that spur change. Not all investigations seek to <b>expose</b> <b>facts</b> about a particular problem; some data-driven reporting does deep analysis and presents interesting results for the general edification of the audience which might be interpreted in different ways or which may contain a wealth of facts concerned with many different potential problems. A factually-constrained investigation with an implied public interest point of view may also find that the system under investigation is working well.|$|R

In this paper we <b>expose</b> <b>facts</b> about the identity federation and the user digital life concepts.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{explores the}} concept of {{locality}} in proofs of global safety properties of asynchronously composed, multi-process programs. Model checking on the full state space is often infeasible due to state explosion. A local proof, in contrast, {{is a collection of}} per-process invariants, which together imply the global safety property. Local proofs can be compact: but a central problem is that local reasoning is incomplete. In this paper, we present a “completion ” algorithm, which gradually <b>exposes</b> <b>facts</b> about the internal state of components, until either a local proof or a real error is discovered. Experiments show that local reasoning can have significantly better performance over a reachability computation. Moreover, for some parameterized protocols, a local proof can be used to show correctness for all instances. ...|$|R

40|$|Life {{can often}} be {{described}} as a series of events. These events contain rich information that, when put together, can reveal history, <b>expose</b> <b>facts,</b> or lead to discoveries. Therefore, many leading organizations are increasingly collecting databases of event sequences: Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), transportation incident logs, student progress reports, web logs, sports logs, etc. Heavy investments were made in data collection and storage, but difficulties still arise {{when it comes to making}} use of the collected data. Analyzing millions of event sequences is a non-trivial task that is gaining more attention and requires better support due to its complex nature. Therefore, I aimed to use information visualization techniques to support exploratory data analysis—an approach to analyzing data to formulate hypotheses worth testing—for event sequences. By working with the domain experts who were analyzing event sequences, I identified two important scenarios that guided my dissertation: First, I explored how to provide an overview of multiple event sequences...|$|R
