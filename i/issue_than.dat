25|$|As Andrew Carnegie was funding {{libraries}} elsewhere {{across the}} United States, a committee {{was formed to}} petition Carnegie for funds to build a public library in Augusta despite the mayor and city council not supporting his involvement. Carnegie agreed to donate $50,000 to fund {{the building of a}} library on the condition the city council pay its upkeep costs of $5,000 per year for maintenance. The city, unwilling to take the financial incentive of running a library for this price per year declined Carnegie's offer leading to a great divide in the city regarding the support or not of a public library. By 1905 public sentiment about a free library was mixed as there was no clear indication whether or not a free library would be brought to the region. Public interest in the library subsequently lessened and funding became a bigger <b>issue</b> <b>than</b> before, forcing the library to close in 1906.|$|E

500|$|Even after {{becoming}} president, Kocharyan {{did not have}} any significant institutional support (e.g. a party, control of the army, a source of money) and remained [...] "in a fundamental sense an outsider in Yerevan." [...] Kocharyan had a more tough position on the Karabakh settlement <b>issue</b> <b>than</b> Ter-Petrosyan. He also urged the international community to recognize the Armenian Genocide, something on which his predecessor did not place importance. In response, Turkey and Azerbaijan tightened their cooperation in isolating Armenia from regional projects. Kocharyan did not put pressure on the Nagorno-Karabakh leadership to concede territory to Azerbaijan. He was supported by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, which was allowed to actively operate after Ter-Petrosyan's resignation a month before the election.|$|E
500|$|According to Sheikh Ahmed Abu Risha, many Iraqis became disaffected with AQI {{but were}} {{hesitant}} {{to take up}} arms against them out of fear. [...] Sheikh Ahmed said that the biggest complaint about AQI was that they were unable to create a degree of normalcy, and that [...] "people [...] are wearing masks... cannot build the country". [...] Other sheikhs specifically said that the large number of killings and kidnappings by AQI prompted the tribal revolt. [...] AQI leader Ayyub al-Masri practically admitted as much in 2008 when he ordered fighters in Anbar to avoid harming Sunnis who were not working closely with coalition forces and [...] "not interfere in social issues". [...] However, David Kilcullen argued that the abuses themselves may have been less of an <b>issue</b> <b>than</b> AQI disrupting the tribes' smuggling businesses, the belief that AQI was linked to Iran, and their general [...] "high-handed" [...] behavior. [...] He added that, whatever the spark, there was already a perception that AQI [...] "had it coming".|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} he began his {{political}} career, Breckinridge had concluded that slavery was more a constitutional <b>issue</b> <b>than</b> a moral one. Slaves were property, and the Constitution did not empower {{the federal government to}} interfere with property rights. From Breckinridge's constructionist viewpoint, allowing Congress to legislate emancipation without constitutional sanction would lead to [...] "unlimited dominion over the territories, excluding the people of the slave states from emigrating thither with their property". As a private citizen, he supported the slavery protections in the Kentucky Constitution of 1850 and denounced the Wilmot Proviso, which would have forbidden slavery in territory acquired in the Mexican–American War. As a state legislator, he declared slavery a [...] "wholly local and domestic" [...] matter, to be decided separately by the residents of each state and territory. Because Washington, D.C., was a federal entity and the federal government could not interfere with property rights, he concluded that forced emancipation there was unconstitutional. As a congressman, he insisted on Congress's [...] "perfect non-intervention" [...] with slavery in the territories. Debating the 1854 Kansas–Nebraska Act, he explained, [...] "The right to establish [...] involves the correlative right to prohibit; and, denying both, I would vote for neither." ...|$|E

500|$|Kennedy's {{campaign}} {{staff was}} disorganized and Kennedy was initially an ineffective campaigner. The Chappaquiddick incident {{emerged as a}} more significant <b>issue</b> <b>than</b> the staff had expected, with several newspaper columnists and editorials criticizing Kennedy's answers on the matter. In the January 1980 Iowa caucuses that initiated the primaries season, Carter demolished Kennedy by a 59–31 percent margin. Kennedy's fundraising immediately declined and his campaign had to downsize, but he remained defiant, saying [...] " [...] we'll see {{who is going to}} whip whose what." [...] Nevertheless, Kennedy lost three New England contests. Kennedy did form a more coherent message about why he was running, saying at Georgetown University: [...] "I believe we must not permit the dream of social progress to be shattered by those whose premises have failed." [...] However, concerns over Chappaquiddick and issues related to personal character prevented Kennedy from gaining the support of many people who were disillusioned with Carter. During a St. Patrick's Day Parade in Chicago, Kennedy had to wear a bullet-proof vest due to assassination threats, and hecklers yelled [...] "Where's Mary Jo?" [...] at him. In the key March 18 primary in Illinois, Kennedy failed to gain the support of Catholic voters, and Carter crushed him, winning 155 of 169 delegates.|$|E
500|$|Catherine Hoad {{finds the}} issue of {{national}} and racial identity central to Viking metal. For instance, she writes that when Trafford and Pluskowski claim that Manowar could not claim religious or racial identity with the Vikings when the band had a lead singer with the [...] "'less than wholly Scandinavian name of Joey di Maio', [...] are approaching a more complex and racially-charged <b>issue</b> <b>than</b> their offhandedness would suggest." [...] While Viking imagery may be readily appropriated, according to Hoad {{the definition of a}} [...] "true" [...] Viking is quite rigid, a rigidity which non-Nordic, and especially non-White, musicians must contend with. As an example, she cites the Brazilian band Viking Throne, which claims legitimacy through European ancestry and historical references to explorations of South America by Nordic countries, and quotes their front-man, Count Nidhogg: [...] "Some people understand perfectly that it doesn't matter where you live, what's really important is your heritage and ancestry. Even living in a South American country as Brazil we all have European blood." [...] Hoad argues that Viking Throne illustrates the cultural importance of claiming Viking ancestry, a culture that operates on largely geographic lines. In contrast to Viking Throne, she cites the band Slechtvalk, which is well known for its brand of Christian Viking metal, but is rarely criticized as inauthentic by the scene. Hoad speculates that the European ethnicity of the band is enough to compensate for its otherwise counter-intuitive music.|$|E

He also wrote a pastoral letter saying Catholics should not vote for politicians who support abortion or other [...] "anti-life" [...] practices. Burke later clarified his position, stating that one could vote for a pro-choice politician and not commit a mortal sin, if one believed there was a more significant moral <b>issue</b> <b>than</b> abortion at hand, but he also {{stated that he}} could not think of any sort of issue that would qualify. In a September 2008 interview, Burke said that [...] "the Democratic Party risks transforming itself definitively into a 'party of death', because of its choices on bioethical questions", especially elective abortion.|$|E
2500|$|In the Netherlands, {{cannabis}} {{and other}} [...] "soft" [...] drugs are partly decriminalised in small quantities. The Dutch government treats {{the problem as}} more of a public health <b>issue</b> <b>than</b> a criminal issue. Contrary to popular belief, cannabis is still illegal, mostly to satisfy the country's agreements with the United Nations. Coffee shops that sell cannabis to people 18 or above are tolerated in some cities, and pay taxes like any other business for their cannabis and hashish sales, although distribution is a grey area that the authorities would rather not go into as it is not decriminalised. Many [...] "coffee shops" [...] are found in Amsterdam and cater mainly to the large tourist trade; the local consumption rate is far lower than in the US. Netherlands has the highest antidrug related public expenditure per capita of all countries in EU (139 EUR per capita, 2004).|$|E
2500|$|In the past, savers {{looking to}} keep their coins and {{valuables}} in safekeeping depositories deposited gold and silver at goldsmiths, receiving in exchange a note for their deposit (see Bank of Amsterdam). These notes gained acceptance as a medium of exchange for commercial transactions and thus became an early form of circulating paper money. As the notes were used directly in trade, the goldsmiths observed that people would not usually redeem all their notes at the same time, and they saw the opportunity to invest their coin reserves in interest-bearing loans and bills. This generated income for the goldsmiths but left them with more notes on <b>issue</b> <b>than</b> reserves with which to pay them. A process was started that altered {{the role of the}} goldsmiths from passive guardians of bullion, charging fees for safe storage, to interest-paying and interest-earning banks. [...] Thus fractional-reserve banking was born.|$|E
50|$|The {{definition}} of Chicano/Mexican American literature is not set in stone, as the term could conceivably encompass both Mexicans who {{have moved to}} the United States and US-born people of Mexican ancestry; this latter group includes many Spanish-speaking families {{who have been in}} the United States for generations, often living on the land (e.g., in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California) before it was part of the United States, and have often faced a different set of <b>issues</b> <b>than</b> their Mexican neighbors because of their status as a linguistic and cultural minority, that is, because they are Spanish-speaking Catholics in a predominantly English-speaking Protestant country. Thus, people from Southern Texas have historically had different <b>issues</b> <b>than</b> people in Northern Mexico (who themselves have different <b>issues</b> <b>than</b> those coming from Southern Mexico, etc.).

In October 2016, First Minister Arlene Foster reaffirmed the DUP's opposition to same-sex marriage, saying the party would continue to issue a petition of concern blocking same-sex marriage in the Assembly {{over the next five}} years. The DUP won fewer than 30 seats at the March 2017 elections, meaning it lost the right to individually block a bill using a petition of concern.

2500|$|On December 15, 2016, Hillary Clinton gave a {{gratitude}} {{speech to}} her campaign donors {{in which she}} reflected on Putin's motivations for the covert operation.

Clinton said Putin had a personal grudge against her, and linked his feelings to her criticism of the 2011 Russian legislative election, adding that he felt she was responsible for fomenting the 2011–13 Russian protests. She drew a specific connection from her 2011 assertions as U.S. Secretary of State that Putin rigged the elections that year, to his actions in the 2016 U.S. elections. During the third debate, Clinton stated that Putin favored Trump, [...] "because he'd rather have a puppet {{as president of the}} United States". Clinton said that by personally attacking her through meddling in the election, Putin additionally took a strike at the American democratic system. She said the cyber attacks were a larger <b>issue</b> <b>than</b> the effect on her own candidacy and called them an attempt to attack the national security of the United States. Clinton noted she was unsuccessful in sufficiently publicizing to the media the cyber attacks against her campaign {{in the months leading up}} to the election.
