5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> {{of view of}} physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing {{processes in}} dynamic systems. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of view of chemistry, a spiral can be generated by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{properties}} of gravity at short distances should be somewhat independent {{of the value of}} the cosmological constant, it is desirable to have a version of the AdS/CFT correspondence for positive cosmological constant. In 2001, Andrew Strominger introduced a version of the duality called the dS/CFT correspondence. This duality involves a model of spacetime called de Sitter space with a positive cosmological constant. Such a duality is interesting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of view of cosmology since many cosmologists believe that the very early universe was close to being de Sitter space. Our universe may also resemble de Sitter space in the distant future.|$|E

5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> {{of view of}} sheaf cohomology, the Mayer–Vietoris {{sequence}} is related to Čech cohomology. Specifically, it arises from the degeneration of the spectral sequence that relates Čech cohomology to sheaf cohomology (sometimes called the Mayer–Vietoris spectral sequence) in the case where the open cover used to compute the Čech cohomology consists of two open sets. This spectral sequence exists in arbitrary topoi.|$|E
