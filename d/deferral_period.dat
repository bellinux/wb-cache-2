40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} four <b>deferral</b> <b>periods</b> for pastures of Brachiaria decumbens cv. Basilisk, {{and the implications}} on the ingestive behavior of crossbred heifers. Animals were distributed in a completely randomized design with four periods (63, 84, 105 and 126 days), each with three replications. The time spent daily by animals on grazing, idle, rumination and in the trough was not affected by periods of sealing the pastures, with mean values of 566. 6; 422. 29; 426. 9 and 24. 1 minutes, respectively. The number of feeding stations, the {{time spent in the}} stations and the number of feeding stations per minute were not different between periods of sealing the pastures, averaging 106. 4; 34. 6 and 3. 0, respectively. The number of bites and the number of bites per minute showed a quadratic effect, with a point of maximum equal to 1, 098 bites and 31 bites per minute, observed on days 93 and 88, respectively. Feed efficiency was linearly decreasing influenced by periods of sealing the pastures. Periods of grazing and idle, the number of bites, the number of bites per minute and feed efficiency are influenced by different <b>deferral</b> <b>periods</b> of pastures under the conditions of this study...|$|R

40|$|Voluntary {{intake and}} {{performance}} of dairy heifers grazing on Urochloa decumbens pastures with two <b>deferral</b> <b>periods</b> are evaluated. The totally randomized experimental design consisted of two treatments and seven replications, with two deferral periods: T 1 = 95 and T 2 = 140 days. Fourteen Holstein-Zebu heifers, average body weight (BW) 300 kg, were used. Intake of forage dry matter was 2. 5 % and 1. 2 BW respectively for treatments 95 and 140 days. In treatment T 2 the animals had an intake of only 139. 5 g of CP, due to low nutrient content, or rather, 3. 4 % of CP in the forage available. There was an intake of NDF of 1. 7 % and 1. 0 of BW for T 1 and T 2, respectively. The average daily weight gain was 785. 8 g day- 1 for T 1 and average weight loss of - 31. 1 g day- 1 for T 2.

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a produção de Brachiaria decumbens diferidos por períodos de 95 e 140 dias.

Two experimental trials (95 and 140 days) were carried out and, in each one, four fertilization strategies were studied {{at the beginning and}} end of summer (0 - 0, 100 - 0, 50 - 50, 0 - 100 kg ha- 1 of N), respectively, with four replications. The highest (p < 0. 05) annual production of drymatter (DM) was verified for the fertilization strategy with 100 kg ha- 1 of N applied in early summer (100 - 0), in pastures deferred for 95 days. However, in autumn, winter and spring, the application strategy of 100 kg ha- 1 of N at end of summer (0 - 100) had greater (p < 0. 05) forage production. Daily dry matter production, when compared to that of summer, was reduced by 8, 89 and 58 % for autumn, winter and spring, respectively, in the 95 -day deferring trial. It can be inferred that the strategy of application of 100 kg ha- 1 in late summer is an appropriate strategy to increase dry matter production for grasses in the two studied <b>deferral</b> <b>periods,</b> reducing the curve of seasonal annual forage production...|$|R

30|$|The basic {{distributed}} {{coordination function}} (DCF), defined in Section 9.2. 7 of the IEEE 802.11 protocol specification [5], {{has been used}} as a de facto MAC for broadcast applications in distributed wireless networks. Hereafter, it will be referred to as a B-MAC. It uses a temporal contention window-based channel arbitration mechanism along with carrier sense multiple access (CSMA). Note that the rationale behind using the contention window, even after performing carrier sensing, is to mandate contending users to access the channel only after a further <b>deferral</b> (random backoff) <b>period</b> which would possibly avoid concurrent transmissions (literally, packet collisions) from multiple contending users. Note that the efficiency of such a collision avoidance mechanism depends on two factors: the size of the contention window and the number of contending users. For a given size of the contention window, the collision probability increases with an increase in the contending population size. As a consequence, the throughput efficiency of the network decreases. Moreover, because of the large number of destinations in broadcast operation, unlike the single destination in unicast operation, simultaneously acknowledging reception from multiple destinations is not feasible. Therefore, the transmitting user cannot know whether the transmitted packet has safely reached its destinations. Thus, B-MAC does not invoke MAC layer retransmission or recovery for the collided packets as its unicast counterpart does. Therefore, broadcast reliability (in terms of successful reception at destinations) also quickly decreases with an increase in contending population size.|$|R
