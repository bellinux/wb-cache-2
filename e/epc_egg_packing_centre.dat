Rakkestad has also developed a diversified economy based on agriculture and forestry such as poultry slaughterhouse and <b>egg</b> <b>packing</b> station, grain silo and mill, woodworking factories and agricultural machinery retailers.

40|$|The {{objective}} was to evaluate the internal quality of white-shelled consume eggs, sanitized or not, stored under different packaging conditions at room temperature. It was used 300 eggs, distributed in a completely randomized experimental design in a 3 × 2 × 4 + 1 factorial arrangement, three packaging conditions (PVC film, partial vacuum, partial vacuum with oxygen gas absorber), storage period (7, 14, 21 and 28 days), sanitized or not, and control (fresh eggs), with four repetitions. At {{the end of each}} period the analysis were performed. Partial vacuum condition was able to maintained Haugh unit, and promoted the best results for yolk index. The weight maintenance was better when packaged under vacuum, with or without O 2 sachets absorbers. Lower values of water activity were obtained in <b>eggs</b> <b>packed</b> in PVC film, and when the sanitation was performed. It can be concluded that the internal egg quality decreases with storage time sharper in the <b>eggs</b> <b>packed</b> in PVC film, because vacuum has preserved some features of them. With sanitation, the storage conditions of eggs in PVC film should be improved because its internal quality decrease was greatest...|$|R

After its closure in the 1930s, {{some parts of the}} building were used by local businesses, including an <b>egg</b> <b>packing</b> station in World War II through to the 1960s, but the buildings were largely destroyed following a fire in 1964.|$|R
50|$|Eggs are {{collected}} {{a minimum of}} twice a day, and usually more frequently. Cracked or dirty eggs are separated, as they are not suitable for hatching. Undersized, oversized or double-yolk eggs are also unsuitable. The eggs might be disinfected by fumigation, are packed in 'flats' or trays, placed in wheeled trolleys, and stored in a cool (15-18C) climate-controlled area. The <b>egg</b> <b>packing</b> room and storage rooms are kept segrated to reduce contamination. The trolleys are delivered by truck to a hatchery perhaps twice a week.|$|R

Poultry sector is playing a very significant role in the reduction of poverty, malnutrition and unemployment problems. At the same time, poultry farms produce a lot of different types of waste products.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to access the potential of a quality cost model to food industry as a quality improvement indicator tool. The quality cost model has been applied for salad pack house and selenium <b>egg</b> <b>pack</b> house. The primary cost analysis show the different proportionality between cost of prevention and cost of control among two types of manufactures. Such evidence is explained by the different risk of products; fresh ready to eat vegetable and the raw egg in shell, thus the different of working model. The cased manufacturers indicated the possibility to apply this cost model as a long term quality improvement evaluation tool in term of the quality cost investment and the business revenue growth...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the causes}} and {{consequences}} of extrapair paternity (EPP) have been studied extensively in birds, {{little is known about}} the regulation of extrapair copulation (EPC) behavior and how it may tie in with other aspects of avian reproduction. In birds, the presence of eggs stimulates incubation and, subsequently, the cessation of egg production. We propose that the same mechanism also regulates female motivation to engage in EPCs. To test this idea, we simulated the earlier onset of laying in blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), by adding model eggs to nests before natural laying commenced. Most females accepted these eggs, covering them with nest material in the natural way. As predicted, these broods hatched more asynchronously than control broods, revealing an earlier onset of incubation, and were less likely to contain extrapair offspring (EPO) suggesting that stimulation from eggs also inhibits motivation to seek <b>EPCs.</b> <b>Egg</b> stimulation is thought to cause cessation of laying a fixed number of days before clutch completion, after a certain hormonal threshold is exceeded. Similarly, a lower threshold may inhibit engagement in EPCs relative to clutch completion, explaining the proportional increase in EPO toward the extremes of clutch size, which we also observed, and would be consistent with a fertility or compatibility insurance function for EPCs. Our findings may represent the best experimental evidence for female-mediated effects on the timing of EPCs and suggest how EPP may be integrated within the regulatory mechanism of avian reproduction. ...|$|R

50|$|Chief {{among the}} {{community}} members who financially and otherwise supported Olga Averbuch following her brother's death was Jane Addams. Addams' Hull House assisted many Eastern European Jewish immigrants since its establishment in 1889, near Averbuch's neighborhood. Addams {{did not believe}} Shippy's version of events, and was moved by Olga's inability to get even a proper burial for her brother. Addams mobilized the resources of Hull House and raised at least $10,000, {{perhaps as much as}} $40,000, for Olga and for her brother's burial. Addams was also instrumental starting the independent investigation into Averbuch's death. She hired lawyer Harold LeClair Ickes for what would be his first case. He ordered Averbuch's body exhumed, and had an independent autopsy performed. This autopsy showed that Averbuch was fatally wounded by a shot from behind, and that he was shot at least once from above. Ickes discovered that Averbuch's brain was removed (a violation of civil and Jewish law), but he kept this information private until some years later. The evidence of this autopsy, as well as the testimony of Olga Averbuch and Lazarus Averbuch's boss at the <b>egg</b> <b>packing</b> facility were presented at the coroner's inquest on March 24, 1908. However, the jury decided the shooting was justified, and Shippy and Foley were exonerated.|$|R
40|$|When a ball is {{dropped in}} fine very loose sand, a splash and {{subsequently}} a jet are observed above the bed, {{followed by a}} granular eruption. To directly and quantitatively determine what happens inside the sand bed, high-speed X-ray tomography measurements are carried out in a custom-made set-up that allows for imaging of a large sand bed at atmospheric pressures. Herewith, we show that the jet originates from the pinch-off point created {{by the collapse of}} the air cavity formed behind the penetrating ball. Subsequently, we measure how the entrapped air bubble rises through the sand, and show that this is consistent with bubbles rising in continuously fluidized beds. Finally, we measure the packing fraction variation throughout the bed. From this we show that there is (i) a compressed area of sand in front of and next to the ball while the ball is moving down, (ii) a strongly compacted region at the pinch-off height after the cavity collapse and (iii) a relatively loosely <b>packed</b> <b>centre</b> {{in the wake of the}} rising bubble...|$|R

40|$|The {{criteria}} for assessing {{external and internal}} quality of eggs include such diverse and important aspects as safety, nutritional, organoleptic and technological properties of eggs and is influenced by {{a broad range of}} factors such as the physiology, genetics, nutrition and management of the hens. Genetics are an efficient tool to improve quality but historically egg productivity was the first priority producing spectacular improvement. Selection for egg quality was used mainly to avoid any negative shift in eggshell quality or internal defect. However, internal quality has taken on greater importance for about 10 years and development of molecular genetics is promising for selecting hens with superior egg quality. Nutrition is important for controlling eggshell quality and can successfully enrich the egg in some minor components of interest for human nutrition. The system of production influences the hygienic quality of eggs, This is particularly true in the alternative systems to cage production. Egg safety can have a very large impact on egg consumption and is highly dependant on government regulation. A promising area for improvement is the development of non invasive and rapid physical techniques to measure eggshell and internal egg quality at the <b>egg</b> <b>packing</b> plant. The sensitivity of this technique can enlarge the number of downgraded egg but eliminate egg at risk for the consumers and is also providing new tools for genetic selection. Egg quality has therefore been continuously improved as has the demand for higher quality eggs from the consumers...|$|R
