40|$|INTRODUCTION: Human serofrequency of {{antibodies}} against Taenia solium antigens {{was determined}} and {{risk factors for}} cysticercosis transmission were identified. METHODS: Individuals (n= 878) from periurban and rural locations of Lages, SC, were interviewed to gather demographic, sanitary and health information. Interviews and blood sample collections by finger prick on Whatman filter paper were performed from August 2004 to May 2005. Observation determined that 850 samples were suitable for analysis and were tested by ELISA using vesicular fluid of Taenia crassiceps heterologous antigen. To ensure {{the reliability of the}} results, 77 samples of the dried blood were matched with sera. The reactive samples were submitted to a serum confirmatory immunoblot (IB) test using purified Taenia crassiceps glycoproteins. RESULTS: The ELISA results for the dried blood and serum samples were statistically consistent. ELISA was positive in 186 (21. 9 %) out of 850 individuals. A group of 213 individuals were asked to collect vein blood for IB (186 with positive result in ELISA and 27 with inappropriate whole blood samples) and 130 attended the request. The IB was positive in 29 (3. 4 %) out of 850 individuals. A significant correlation (p = 0. 0364) was determined among individuals who tested positive in the IB assay who practiced both pig rearing and <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardening.</b> CONCLUSIONS: ELISA with dried blood eluted from filter paper was suitable for cysticercosis population surveys. In Lages, human infection was associated with pig rearing and <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardening.</b> The prevalence index was compatible with other Latin American endemic areas...|$|E

The data were recorded at 40 and 60 days after sowing (DAS). Maximum plant height at 40 DAS was recorded for the combined effect of NAA and BAP at a concentration of 1000 μM (each), while BAP alone at 100 μM concentration showed maximum plant height at 60 DAS. Maximum number of leaves was shown by NAA (10 μM) both at 40 and 60 DAS. Increase in leaf length was observed for NAA (10 μM) and BAP (100 μM) both at 40 and 60 DAS. Significant increases in root length were recorded where maximum root length was in plots treated with BAP (1000 μM) applied 40 DAS while the mixture of BAP (10 μM) and NAA (10000 μM) induced significant increases in root length when applied 60 DAS. Maximum fresh weight of shoot was observed for NAA (1000 μM) and BAP (1000 μM) while maximum shoot dry weight was observed in plots treated with NAA and BAP at a concentration of (1000 μM) each.

Observatory skills regarding regular plant growth and ecology were enhanced through agroecosystem analysis, which, in turn, improved their crop management decisions. The largest portion of FFS participants (38. 2 %) was illiterate and with regard to age, the largest category (36. 6 %) was 21 – 30 years old. The participatory FFS activities not only enhanced the awareness of participating rural women folk but also provided a forum to share their experiences.

Introduction: The {{purpose of}} a kitchen garden is not the {{production}} of vegetables to supply the market but to supply the home table demand. In raising vegetables for home use the expenditure {{of time and money}} is amply repaid, and is well worth the effort. A kitchen garden is a necessity for every farm and is usually a possibility to the average town home except of course in the large cities. A good garden should furnish {{at least half of the}} family living for the entire year, and is thus an important means of support. Location; The kitchen garden should be conveniently near the kitchen, but soil, exposure to sun, and winds, drainage, and nearness to large trees are all subjects to be considered as well as convenience. If possible the garden spot should slope to the south or southeast, and there should be some protection from north winds, such as trees, providing they are not too near, a hill or even a good wall, or tight board fence. This protection will make considerable difference in time required for early vegetables to mature...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} effect of row spacing and {{frequency}} of cuttings on spinach (Spinacia oleracea), an experiment was carried out at the <b>Kitchen</b> <b>Gardening</b> Training Center for Women at 61 JB Dharorh Faisalabad, Pakistan, during 2014. The experiment was laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with factorial arrangements having three replications with a plot size of 3 m × 6 m. This experiment was comprised of two factors, i. e. row spacing (Broadcast, 30 cm apart rows and 45 cm apart rows) and cutting frequency (45 days after sowing and 30 after the first cutting). The result showed that differences in row spacing have non-significant effects on plant height (cm), number of leaves, Fresh Biomass (kg/ha- 1) and Dried Biomass (kg/ha- 1). The broadcast method of sowing gave the prominent results in all the parameters, such as the maximum plant height of 25. 49 (cm), maximum number of leaves at 37. 8, maximum fresh biomass of 2252 (kg/ ha- 1) and dried biomass of 217. 95 (kg/ ha- 1). However, the number of cuttings gave significant results for plant height (cm), fresh biomass (kg/ ha- 1) and dried biomass (kg/ ha- 1). 2 nd cuttings showed a maximum plant height of 26. 59 (cm), maximum fresh biomass of 2254. 67 (kg/ ha- 1) and dried biomass of 222. 6 (kg/ ha- 1), but 1 st cuttings showed {{the maximum number of}} leaves (36. 56) ...|$|E
