5|$|The Simpsons {{has been}} dubbed into several other languages, {{including}} Japanese, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. It {{is also one of}} the few programs dubbed in both standard French and Quebec French. The show has been broadcast in Arabic, but due to Islamic customs, numerous aspects of the show <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed.</b> For example, Homer drinks soda instead of beer and eats Egyptian beef sausages instead of hot dogs. Because of such changes, the Arabized version of the series met with a negative reaction from the lifelong Simpsons fans in the area.|$|E

5|$|The fort is {{designed}} as a defensible battery, rather than a defensive strongpoint. The faces of the fort join to form a half-moon shape or lunette. The guns' primary role was to defend Port Adelaide and the Semaphore anchorage rather than the fort itself, and the design reflects this. It {{was intended to be}} supported by field artillery, cavalry and infantry for self-defence and to repel landings. While the fort retains its original form, the ditch and glacis (embankment) have been modified and are largely non-existent in some areas. Ground levels <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> to accommodate paths and a caravan park, and the original western fence no longer exists.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} the uneven bars final, in which Britain's Beth Tweddle placed 4th, was called into {{question}} after documents were found that seemed to say that Chinese gymnasts He Kexin and Yang Yilin were only 14, and therefore under the age required to compete, {{at the time of}} the games. An investigation into their ages was launched by the IOC to determine whether it was necessary to disqualify them, thus Tweddle's standing could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> to 2nd, giving her a silver medal. After a five-and-a-half-week investigation the Chinese athletes were cleared and the original results allowed to stand.|$|E
5|$|When Nike {{took over}} from Adidas as Arsenal's kit {{provider}} in 1994, Arsenal's away colours were again changed to two-tone blue shirts and shorts. Since {{the advent of}} the lucrative replica kit market, the away kits <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> regularly, with Arsenal usually releasing both away and third choice kits. During this period the designs have been either all blue designs, or variations on the traditional yellow and blue, such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the 2001–02 season, the yellow and dark grey used from 2005 to 2007, and the yellow and maroon of 2010 to 2013.|$|E

5|$|The {{graphics}} {{have been}} improved from Diamond and Pearl. The dialog boxes of previous games <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> to speech balloons that appear over other characters' heads, allowing {{more than one}} character to speak at once. Japanese players can have kanji appear on screen, rather than only hiragana and katakana. During battles, the sprites of the Pokémon are fully animated and the camera changes position to highlight specific parts of the battle. In addition to continuing {{the day and night}} cycle introduced in Gold and Silver, Black and White introduces a seasonal cycle, with the seasons advancing every month rather than being linked to the calendar. Outside areas appear differently depending on the season, such as changing of leaves in autumn or snow on the ground in winter. Certain areas are only accessible during certain seasons, and different Pokémon {{can be found in the}} wild in winter where others are encountered in the other seasons. The Pokémon Deerling and Sawsbuck change their physical appearance to match the seasons.|$|E
5|$|Meeting Sweet at The Bronze, Buffy {{offers a}} deal to Sweet: she will {{take the place of}} her sister if she can’t kill him. When asked by Sweet what she thinks about life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning ("Something to Sing About"). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at finding out what she’s done. Upon divulging this truth, Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke — on the verge of combusting as Sweet’s other victims have been shown to do — until Spike stops her, telling her {{that the only way to}} go forward is to just keep living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, hoping he would be shown a happy ending for his {{marriage}} plans. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet's “bride”, tells the group how much fun they have been ("What You Feel—Reprise") and disappears. The Scoobies realize that their relationships <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs ("Where Do We Go from Here?"). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him out, and they kiss ("Coda").|$|E
