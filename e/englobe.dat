50|$|Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov already {{announced}} the “principle of immunization” during his voluntary exile in Italy, {{where he went}} to undertake some studies, the results {{of which he had}} promptly communicated to Pasteur. The phagocytosis theory is based on the notion that phagocytes are cells that have the power to <b>englobe</b> foreign bodies - and above all bacteria - introduced inside an organism. German biologists opposed to his doctrine the humoral theory: they claimed to have found in Roux's serum some substances able to reveal the presence of microbes, and to ensure their destruction if properly stimulated. The German scientist Eduard Buchner referred to these substances as “alexine” and two other biologists, Von Behring and Kitasato, demonstrated their lytic power towards bacteria. In 1894 one of these scientist published the result of an experiment that appeared to completely refute Metchnikoff’s ideas: using the cholera vibrio, discovered ten years before by Robert Koch, as an antigen, Richard F. J. Pfeiffer introduced it in the abdomen of a guinea pig already vaccinated against this disease, and was able to observe the destruction of the vibrio in the local blood plasma, without the participation of the phagocytes. Not even this study was able to shake Metchnikoff’s belief and faith in his theory, and his ideas, as well as Pfeiffer’s and Buchner’s, would all contribute to the elaboration of the current theory of the immune system.|$|E

5000|$|A similar {{thing happens}} with the {{depiction}} of blood, and real historical events; many {{things have to be}} readjusted to fit the country’s tolerance and taste in order not to hurt sensibilities. This {{is probably one of the}} reasons why so many games take place in imaginary worlds. This customisation effort draws on the knowledge of geopolitical strategists, like Kate Edwards from <b>Englobe.</b> During the 2006 Game Developers Conference in California she explained the importance of being culturally aware when internationalising games in a presentation called [...] "Fun vs. Offensive: Balancing the 'Cultural Edge' of Content for Global Games" [...] (Edwards 2006). Both developers and publishers want to please their clients. Gamers are not particularly interested in where the game comes from, or who created it any more than someone buying a new car or DVD player. A product for mass consumption only keeps the branding features of the trademark; all the other characteristics might be subject to customisation due to the need to appeal to the local market. Therefore, the translation will be in some cases an actual recreation, or, to put it in the words of Mangiron & O’Hagan (2006), a [...] "transcreation", where translators will be expected to produce a text with the right [...] "feel" [...] for the target market. It is important for translators to be aware of the logic behind this. Video games are a software product, and as such, they will have manuals and instructions, as well as interactive menus and help files. This will call for technical translation. On the other hand, we will also find narration and dialogue closer to literary texts or film scripts where a more creative translation would be expected. However, unlike most forms of translation, video games can adapt or even change the original script, as long as it is in the search of enhanced fun and playability of the target culture. We can only find a parallel of this type of practice in the translation of children’s literature where professionals often adapt or alter the original text to improve children’s understanding and enjoyment of the book.|$|E
