40|$|The NASA Scientific and Technical Information Office was {{assigned}} {{the responsibility to}} examine {{the benefits of the}} utilization of <b>electronic</b> <b>printing</b> and duplicating <b>systems</b> throughout NASA Installations and Headquarters. The subject of this report is the documentation of the methodology used in justifying the acquisition of the most cost beneficial solution for the printing and duplicating requirements of a duplicating facility that is contemplating the acquisition of an <b>electronic</b> <b>printing</b> and duplicating <b>system.</b> Four alternatives are presented with each alternative costed out with its associated benefits. The methodology goes a step further than just a cost benefit analysis through its comparison of risks associated with each alternative, sensitivity to number of impressions and productivity gains on the selected alternative and finally the return on investment for the selected alternative. The report can be used in conjunction with the two earlier reports, NASA-TM- 106242 and TM- 106510 in guiding others in determining the cost effective duplicating alternative...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{flexibility}} {{is considered an}} asset in consumer electronics and next-generation <b>electronic</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Printed</b> and flexible <b>electronic</b> devices could be embedded into clothing or other surfaces at home or office or in many products such as low-cost sensors integrated in transparent and flexible surfaces. In this context inks based on graphene and related two-dimensional materials (2 DMs) are gaining increasing attention owing to their exceptional (opto) electronic, electrochemical and mechanical properties. The current limitation relies {{on the use of}} solvents, providing stable dispersions of graphene and 2 DMs and fitting the proper fluidic requirements for printing, which are in general not environmentally benign, and with high boiling point. Non-toxic and low boiling point solvents do not possess the required rheological properties (i. e., surface tension, viscosity and density) for the solution processing of graphene and 2 DMs. Such solvents (e. g., water, alcohols) require the addition of stabilizing agents such as polymers or surfactants for the dispersion of graphene and 2 DMs, which however unavoidably corrupt their properties, thus preventing their use for the target application. Here, we demonstrate a viable strategy to tune the fluidic properties of water/ethanol mixtures (low-boiling point solvents) to first effectively exfoliate graphite and then disperse graphene flakes to formulate graphene-based inks. We demonstrate that such inks can be used to print conductive stripes (sheet resistance of ~ 13 kΩ/□) on flexible substrates (polyethylene terephthalate), moving a step forward towards the realization of graphene-based <b>printed</b> <b>electronic</b> devices...|$|R
40|$|Pressure {{platforms}} {{offer the}} potential to measure and record electronic footprints rapidly; however, the accuracy of geometric indexes derived from these prints has not been investigated. A comparison of conventional ink footprints with simultaneously acquired <b>electronic</b> <b>prints</b> revealed significant differences in several geometric indexes. The contact area was consistently underestimated by the <b>electronic</b> <b>prints</b> and resulted in {{a significant change in}} the arch index. The long plantar angle was poorly correlated between techniques. This study demonstrated that electronic footprints, derived from a pressure platform, are not representative of the equivalent ink footprints and, consequently, should not be interpreted with reference to literature o...|$|R
