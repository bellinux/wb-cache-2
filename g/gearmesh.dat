40|$|Abstract In {{the present}} study, {{in order to}} detect {{the fault of the}} gearmeshs, two engaged gears based on {{research}} department of a major automotive company have been modeled. First off, by using the CATIA software the fault was induced to the output gear. Then, the faulty <b>gearmesh</b> and non-faulty <b>gearmesh</b> is modeled to find the fault pattern to predict and estimate the failure of the <b>gearmesh.</b> The induced defect is according to the frequently practical fault that takes place to the teeth of gears. In order to record the acceleration signals to calculate the decomposition algorithm, mount the accelerometer on accessible place of the output shaft to recognize the pattern. Then, for more realistic simulation, noise is added to the output signal. At the first step by means of Butterworth low pass digital, the noise has to be removed from signals after that by using the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), signals have decomposed into the Instinct Mode Function (IMF) and every IMF were tested by using the Instantaneous Frequency (IF) in way of Hillbert Transform (HT). For this purpose a code was developed in MATLAB software. Then, in order to detect the presence of the fault the frequency spectrum of IMF's are created and defect is detected in <b>gearmesh</b> frequency of the spectrum...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} is to detect the defect of the gear on the gearbox using vibration signal analysis. The experiment was done on four condition of gear. Gears are in good condition, a half broken tooth, one broken tooth, and cracked. The gear rotational speeds were taken in 300 rpm, 750 rpm, and 2250 rpm. Vibration data acquisition was done using vibrationmeter and PC. Vibrationmeter record the signal on time domain and convert it to frequency domain. Defect analysis {{was done in the}} time domain and frequency domain. Experiment result showed that time domain, defect of gear could detected by spike appearing every one period of shaft revolution. This case was indication of gear having broken one broken tooth. Then, on two broken teeth, amplitude of spike period was smaller than one broken tooth condition. Whereas on a half broken tooth condition failure was difficult to detect at time domain. At frequency domain, indication of a half broken tooth was seen by increasing amplitude of <b>gearmesh</b> frequency four time to 39, 57 volt and sideband appearing. Then on one broken tooth indication could be seen by increasing amplitude of <b>gearmesh</b> frequency ten times to 123, 5 volt and sideband appearing. On cracked gear, indication could be seen by increasing amplitude of <b>gearmesh</b> frequency four times to 123, 5 volt and appearing many sidebands. Every sideband have a distance a shaft revolution frequency. Sideband appearing and increasing amplitude of <b>gearmesh</b> can be detected as failure of gearbox...|$|E
40|$|A plane {{model of}} a {{compound}} planetary gear train is proposed to predict the dynamic response of such transmission set which is widely used in automatic vehicle drive transmissions. Translational and rotational motions of the mounted gears are considered. The energetic Lagrange formulation is used to recover the equations of motion and the modal characteristics of the system. Profile error is modelled and {{taken into account in}} the equation of motion. Simulations were done with a numerical example for the cases of a healthy system and defected system. An amplitude modulation of the <b>gearmesh</b> signal by the defect signals causing higher vibration levels is observed...|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{were made}} into how squared {{envelope}} analysis and Self Adaptive Noise Cancellation (SANC) {{can be used}} to improve the reliability of bearing diagnostics in gearboxes. Present models of bearing fault signals were improved by incorporating slight random fluctuations into the spacings between bearing fault impulses. This allowed simulated signals to be used for the investigation of squared envelope analysis and the optimisation of SANC. The values for the three variables which affect the adaptation process of S LṄC are optimised for removing discrete frequency noise from bearing fault components; this was done by using simulated bearing fault and gear signals. The recommended values were then applied to enhance the bearing fault signals recorded from an actual helicopter gearbox. Analysis of the squared envelope can give an improvement in bearing diagnostics if the signal-to-noise ratio is greater than unity. The MSR (Mean Squared Ratio) of signal to noise in the demodulation band and the percentage fluctuation of the bearing fault impulses were found to influence this factor and their values determined for a SNR of unity. Phase demodulation around a bearing frequency component in the envelope spectrum {{can be used to}} obtain a value for the percentage fluctuation in spacing of bearing fault impulses. Signals measured from a helical gear rig, spur gear rig, planetary gear rig arid helicopter gearboxes were used to test the performance of SANC. From the analyses, the combinations of modulations and carrier components can be categorised into four types. Bearing fault components from additive impulse responses (the classic model) appear in the spectrum as random frequency components and remain after SANC. Bearing fault components which modulate discrete frequency carriers appear in the spectrum as discrete frequency components, and thus are removed by SANC. <b>Gearmesh</b> harmonics which appear in the spectrum as discrete frequency carriers are also removed by SANC. However <b>gearmesh</b> frequency components which modulate random carriers appear in the spectrum as random components and thus are not removed by SANC. Although in this research the SANC technique did not provide an improvement in all bearing diagnostic cases, it provided a deeper insight into how bearing faults may manifest themselves in the spectrum...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a comprehensive methodology for predicting and minimising the noise radiated from a constant speed gearbox assembly {{by means of}} attaching optimally placed stiffening ribs on the casing. The procedure involves building an FE model of the gearbox, which is updated using modal parameters extracted from a modal test. This is followed by synthesis of the required FRFs {{with respect to the}} forcing degrees-of-freedom. The forces, which are assumed to act only at the bearings are identified from these FRFs and the measured operational velocities of the casing. The identified forces are then used to excite the updated FE model to re-calculate the vibration velocities. A boundary element method is used to calculate the final radiated sound power to be compared with that measured. The same forces are used later to excite the modified gearbox casing to determine the improvement given by optimised modification. The optimisation study minimises the vibration energy of the casing in 10 % bands around critical frequencies, in this case the first two harmonics of the <b>gearmesh</b> frequency. To allow for errors in the model, the excitation is by white noise, so as to produce wide stop bands, rather than minimising the response at particular frequencies. The vibration energy is weighted for radiation efficiency, A-weighting, and relative source strength in the bands. The final optimal stiffener layout is validated through a final vibration and acoustic calculation on the updated gearbox model using the forces identified in the earlier steps. The study of one particular gearbox concludes that i) the proposed hybrid optimisation scheme produces a theoretical effective noise reduction of 3 dBA for the total sound power. ii) Because the <b>gearmesh</b> harmonics were targeted, a further 5 dB improvement was effectively gained by eliminating the tonal penalty which otherwise applied. iii) From plate studies it was demonstrated that the stiffening ribs could be attached using epoxy cement (to avoid welding) and that the properties of the cemented joint could be determined by model updating after attaching one rib, so as to obtain a better prediction of the final optimised result...|$|E
40|$|Gearboxes usually run under {{fluctuating}} load conditions during service, however most {{of papers}} {{available in the}} literature describe models of gearboxes under stationary load conditions. Main task of published papers is fault modeling for their detection. Considering real situation from industry, the assumption of stationarity of load conditions cannot be longer kept. Vibration signals issued from monitoring in maintenance operations differ from mentioned models (due to load non-stationarity) and {{may be difficult to}} analyze which lead to erroneous diagnosis of the system. The objective {{of this paper is to}} study the influence of time varying load conditions on a gearbox dynamic behavior. To investigate this, a simple spur gear system without defects is modeled. It is subjected to a time varying load. The speed-torque characteristic of the driving motor is considered. The load variation induces speed variation, which causes a variation in the <b>gearmesh</b> stiffness period. Computer simulation shows deep amplitude modulations with sidebands that don't differ from those obtained when there is a defective tooth. In order to put in evidence the time varying load effects, Short Time Fourier Transform and then Smoothed Wigner-Ville distribution are used. Results show that the last one is well suited for the studied case...|$|E
40|$|Vibration data {{acquired}} during {{system monitoring}} periods {{are rich in}} harmonics characterizing the presence of several mechanical parts in the system. Periodic variations of the torque or of the load create modulation side-bands around those harmonics. Even if the energy impact of the side-bands is small compared to the total energy of the signal, they are strong indicators of failures in mechanical systems. Unfortunately, these effects are of little concern in most of condition monitoring systems. When considering the problem with a signal processing point of view, a demodulation of those side-bands allows a time visualization of the modulating functions which are a precise image of the torque or the load variations. This demodulation can {{be done on the}} analytical signal directly derived from the original data. But to do that, data and specifically its spectrum should respect some constraints. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to underline those constraints, often forgotten. In particular, the respect of the non-overlapping condition in the Bedrosian theorem is discussed for signals and modulation rates that can be encountered on rotating machines. The respect of the constraints depends on the monitored phenomenon (e. g., <b>gearmesh,</b> rotating shaft), the modulation phenomenon (e. g., belt frequency, rotor current) and the type of medium (e. g., vibrations, electrical current). In the case where the constraints are not satisfied, we explain the consequences in terms of signal processing. These results are illustrated by two industrial case studies...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} scope of one out of many ways to {{diagnose}} gearboxes, demodulating the excited vibrational signals to enhance fault detection and identification. The topic is not only of academic interest since the achievements {{that can be made}} by successful machine condition monitoring in the industry. It has a potential value that is close to be absurd, for example unplanned production stops is commonly known {{to be one of the}} worst nightmares for manufacturing companies and if one can detect faults in early stages one can improve the possibilityto plan a production stop and therefore increase the profit. Four demodulation algorithms were developed and implemented in MATLAB on data characterized by close to stationarity and distinctive energy centered around the harmonics of the <b>gearmesh</b> frequency.  The resulting algorithms for narrowband phase and amplitude demodulation was shown to outperform Hilbert transform based phase and amplitude demodulation algorithms in gearbox diagnostics. One of the goals with the thesis was therefore reached; demodulation algorithms were developed and implemented on data. A comparison of these algorithms was done and a conclusion of which demodulation technique is superior was done. Experimental work was carried out on a test-rig and both local and distributed faults were introduced to two gearboxes, one kind of fault per gearbox. However, the data acquired from the test-rig showed severe non-stationarity and smeared spectrum properties even when angular resampling was performed and therefore a major drawback of the demodulation techniques was exploited since the methods for demodulation in this thesis are not applicable for signals with smeared spectrums. The other goal was therefore not accomplished; to distinguish a local fault from a distributed fault in data acquired by experimental work by applying the selected demodulation techniques. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} presents improved {{techniques to}} simulate gearbox vibrations due to faults in gears and bearings. Lumped parameter models (LPMs) {{are widely used}} to study the dynamic behaviour of mechanical systems such as gearboxes. However, LPMs contain limited information about flexible structures such as the casing. This results in poor spectral matching over a wide frequency range, and was found not to properly represent the modulation of <b>gearmesh</b> signals by extended bearing faults, this being affected by interaction with the casing dynamic properties. An alternative approach based on direct finite element analysis (FEA) is not usually viable as the model size and thus computing resource requirements become prohibitive. Hence an improved simulation model was developed by coupling the LPM of the internals (shafts, gears and bearings) with a reduced FE model of the casing based on the Craig-Bampton method of component mode synthesis (CMS) over the frequency range of interest. Prior to model reduction, the FE model of the casing was updated by correlating {{with the results of}} experimental modal analysis (EMA). The combined model was equally capable of simulating bearing faults in the UNSW parallel shaft spur gearbox. The responses due to bearing fault entry and exit were investigated, which can be used to predict the fault size  a vital parameter in bearing diagnostics and prognostics. Simulated results compared well with measurements. The combined model was further improved by making a reduced FE model of the internals, to create a full reduced model of the gearbox. A simplified transverse-torsional LPM was developed to simulate planet gear faults such as tooth cracks and spalls in the UNSW planetary gearbox. The effect of the two simultaneous meshes of the planet gear with the ring and sun gears was investigated since the contact with the two gears is on opposite flanks of each planet gear tooth. The simulated results correlated well with measurements and clearly differentiated the two types of faults with reduction in the stiffness due to a tooth crack visible in both contacts whereas a spall on one flank showed up only in one contact...|$|E
