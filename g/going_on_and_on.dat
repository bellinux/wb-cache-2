Rajitha S. of The New Indian Express wrote, [...] "Inspite of an entertaining first half, Aagadu fizzles out {{in the second half}} and makes for an ordinary affair". Sify commented that Vaitla [...] "has thrown the script of this film to the winds" [...] and [...] "relies on comedy, but at times it's too much", concluding that Aagadu [...] "doesn't pass the muster" [...] and is [...] "definitely not a heavy weight film".|$|E
500|$|Writer Bill Oakley {{suggested}} the episode's barbecue scenes. Cohen's first draft contained a more philosophical argument between Lisa and Homer about eating meat, but Oakley told Cohen {{that the story}} needed something more specific {{to serve as the}} basis of Homer and Lisa's dispute. George Meyer, a writer known among the staff for his [...] "bizarre physical jokes", contributed the idea of the barbecue pig getting caught in the spillway and flying into the air. Cohen credits writer John Swartzwelder for inspiring the scene in which Homer finds it impossible to believe that bacon, ham, and pork chops could possibly come from the same animal. [...] According to Cohen it was based on a real statement made by Swartzwelder, who was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> about how amazing the pig is for the variety of cuts of meat that come from it.|$|E

2500|$|The {{overwhelmingly}} positive British {{response to}} the film led to its critical and commercial success throughout Europe. Derek Malcolm of Cosmopolitan wrote, [...] " [...] is fast {{becoming one of the}} cult movies of the year ... The great virtue of the film is the way it grabs hold of its audience and simply refuses to let go. It exploits all our fears of irrational violence and unmotivated attack, {{and at the same time}} manages to laugh at itself without spoiling the tension - a very considerable feat. Carpenter, who is clearly a director with places to go, has succeeded in making a comedy that scares the pants off us. And don't think you're laughing at it. As a matter of fact, it's laughing at you." [...] Malcolm later wrote that he held some reservations about the film: [...] "I don't feel like <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> about the movie, partly because I think it is in grave danger of being oversold anyway, and partly because it isn't much more to me than tremendous fun".

No one can be trusted and both the Princess and the King are in mortal danger, so Curdie realises why the Old Princess has sent him: he must save the king (Irene's father) from a plot to poison him and steal his kingdom by forcibly marrying his daughter Princess Irene to an evil pretender. With {{the aid of the}} old Princess, who has been disguised as a housemaid, the king, his daughter, and the kingdom are saved. Curdie and Princess Irene are later married and rule the kingdom after the king dies.

He alludes... to the upheaving of one of the Eolian islands, previous to a volcanic eruption.
