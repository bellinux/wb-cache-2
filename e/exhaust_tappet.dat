50|$|The {{first two}} model years (XS-1 and XS-1B) were kick start only, with an {{electric}} starter added from the 1972 model year on. This had a compression release added to the front left <b>exhaust</b> <b>tappet</b> cover resulting in a square versus triangular cover found on the other exhaust and intake covers. Upon removal of the compression release mechanism in 1974 due to uprated starter, the square cover at the left exhaust valve was continued.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine is}} by no means silent. <b>Exhaust</b> and <b>tappet</b> noise with a {{continuous}} if subdued howl of pinions all merge with other unidentifiable sounds but there is no suggestion these noises may not be maintained so long as the driver wishes with unflagging regularity for hour after hour. The seat puts the driver up high and its easy to underestimate road speed. It is one thing to go fast in a straight line but quite another to cover a distance at high average speed. This car has truly amazing roadholding, it is high and narrow yet it passes through roundabouts almost as if there were none there. It is the designer's perfect balance of the whole chassis which makes this phenomenon possible.|$|R
50|$|The valves are {{typically}} {{operated by a}} camshaft rotating at half {{the speed of the}} crankshaft. It has a series of cams along its length, each designed to open a valve during the appropriate part of an intake or <b>exhaust</b> stroke. A <b>tappet</b> between valve and cam is a contact surface on which the cam slides to open the valve. Many engines use one or more camshafts “above” a row (or each row) of cylinders, as in the illustration, in which each cam directly actuates a valve through a flat tappet. In other engine designs the camshaft is in the crankcase, in which case each cam usually contacts a push rod, which contacts a rocker arm that opens a valve, or in case of a flathead engine a push rod is not necessary. The overhead cam design typically allows higher engine speeds because it provides the most direct path between cam and valve.|$|R
