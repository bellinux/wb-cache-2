25|$|The Seagull had an {{all-metal}} construction with a two spar {{parasol wing}} {{mounted on a}} pylon connecting it to the fuselage. The single engine, a Rolls-Royce Griffon drove contra-rotating propellers; radiators were mounted below the engine in the pylon. The rear of the pylon accommodated an observer's position with two windows. An <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> was fitted on the wing, behind the engine, so the aircraft could be easily lifted from the water by crane.|$|E
5000|$|A cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> is an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> {{typically}} {{used as a}} structural tie down [...] in building construction where {{the eye of the}} bolt must be fastened to a point that cannot be directly below where the shaft would otherwise be fastened. This often occurs where a bearer must be tied down to a post or column but the bearer cannot be directly fastened to the post of column.|$|E
5000|$|She {{designed}} {{a necklace of}} an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> on a chain, meant to represent [...] "strength without a fist"; she gave {{the first of these}} to Arlene Raven and Judy Chicago when they started the Feminist Studio Workshop in 1972. Since then she has given them to other women with whom she shares a vision of the creation of women's culture. Members of the Feminist Studio Workshop of 1978-79 also made 500 of these necklaces to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the Woman's Building in Los Angeles. The feminist art group Sisters of Jam (Mikaela & Moa Krestesen) turned the necklace into a mobile monument; they see the <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> [...] "as a symbol for the work already done but also as an encouragement for the work that is not yet completed."

50|$|Machinery <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> {{are fully}} {{threaded}} {{and may have}} a collar, making them suitable for use with angular loads up to 45°. <b>Eye</b> <b>bolts</b> without a shoulder {{should not be used}} for angular loads.|$|R
50|$|Wire eye lags (also called {{screw thread}} <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> <b>eye</b> screws, or turned/bent eye lags) have a wood screw thread {{for use in}} wood or lag anchors. Like wire <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> wire <b>eye</b> lags are {{intended}} for light duty applications {{and should not be}} used for angular loads.|$|R
50|$|A turnbuckle, {{stretching}} screw or bottlescrew is {{a device}} for adjusting the tension or length of ropes, cables, tie rods, and other tensioning systems. It normally {{consists of two}} threaded <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> one screwed into each end of a small metal frame, one with a left-hand thread {{and the other with}} a right-hand thread. The tension can be adjusted by rotating the frame, which causes both <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> to be screwed in or out simultaneously, without twisting the <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> or attached cables.|$|R

50|$|An <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> is a bolt with a loop at one end. They {{are used}} to firmly attach a {{securing}} eye to a structure, so that ropes or cables may then be tied to it.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the first}} actions of Superintendent Sumner Increase Kimball, the only {{superintendent}} of the U.S. Life-Saving Service, {{was to find a}} better line-throwing device. Kimball realized he needed the best artillery expertise available, so he engaged the help of the Army Board of Ordnance and in 1877 they assigned David A. Lyle, First Lieutenant, U.S.A (1845-1937), a West Point and MIT graduate who began research and testing that resulted in reliable efficient designs. Lyle developed 3 bronze, smooth-bore guns of different sizes and the 2+1/2 in gun became the USLSS standard line-throwing gun. Projectiles for the gun were made of cast iron with a wrought iron <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> screwed into the base as an attachment point for the shot line. The projectile for the 2+1/2 in gun was 15+3/4 in long and weighed [...] It was placed into the 24 in gun barrel so the <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> with the line attached was sticking out. After firing, the projectile rotated so that the <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> and line were trailing. The gun had a large recoil from firing. A standard charge of 1.5 oz of gunpowder would knock the gun back 6 ft. The maximum rescue charge of 8 oz would send the gun flying back even further.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>bolts</b> made by bending a rod or wire into a loop {{are only}} {{suitable}} for light duty applications, as heavy loads {{can cause the}} eye to open. For high loads, <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> with forged or welded loops should be chosen, as they can withstand loads up to the tensile strength of the material {{of which they are}} made.|$|R
50|$|Cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> {{are made}} with {{different}} degrees of crank and lengths of shaft for flexibility.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} of several trigger {{mechanisms}} is two <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> and a peg through both <b>bolts.</b> The <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> are usually {{placed at the}} bottom of the frame, locking above the arm to prevent accidental release. In larger designs, the trigger system is applied at the top of the drop channel. Large scale designs require special trigger mechanisms that can hold the weight of the throwing arm.|$|R
5000|$|A {{ring bolt}} is an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> with a captive ring passing through it. The loose ring is articulated, {{such that it}} can rotate {{in at least one}} axis, and can thus reduce bending forces on the bolt when loaded and will present the minimum {{obstruction}} when [...] "flat".|$|E
50|$|Stress positions: Prisoners {{are forced}} to stand, handcuffed and with their feet {{shackled}} to an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> in the floor (and/or wall), for more than 40 hours, causing the prisoners' weight {{to be placed on}} just one or two muscles. This creates an intense amount of pressure on the legs, leading first to pain and then muscle failure.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} {{types of}} sex swing exist: traditional swing, door swing, body swing, and fantasy swing. The body swing is suspended from one partner's body.

40|$|The bond {{strength}} for elastomeric materials to prevent detachment of the impression from the custom tray is important. The effect of disinfection procedure of custom trays with freshly prepared 1 : 213 iodophor and 10 % sodium hypochlorite disinfectants on the tensile {{bond strength}} of polyvinyl siloxane impression adhesive/systems were evaluated. Thirty autopolymerizing resin plates {{were made in}} silicone mold. Before, the resin became rubbery, a metal nut with retentive threads was embedded so that an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> could be thread into it for attachment during tensile testing. The specimens were stored in ambient air for 24 hours before testing. Ten specimens were exposed to freshly prepared 1 : 213 iodophor and additional 10 resin specimens were exposed to freshly made 10 % sodium hypochlorite disinfectant solution. The specimens were stored in sealed plastic bags for 24 hours. The remaining 10 specimens served as control. After application of adhesive, addition reaction silicone impression material was injected over the tray specimens. The force necessary to separate the impression from the tray material was recorded using Instron Universal Load Testing Machine. The {{results indicated that the}} use of iodophor and sodium hypochlorite disinfectant solutions reduced the bond strength of impression adhesive system to autopolymerizing resin tray compared to control (iodophor =. 38 MPa, sodium hypochlorite =. 49 MPa, control. 52 MPa). It is therefore suggested to perforate the tray at the construction stage and disinfected in the laboratory to overcome the reduced bond strength of polyvinyl silicone impression adhesive/system to tray material.

40|$|A {{leaf spring}} {{is a simple}} form of spring, {{commonly}} used for the suspension in wheeled vehicles. Leaf Springs are long and narrow plates attached to the frame of a trailer that rest above or below the trailer's axle. There are mono leaf springs, or single-leaf springs, that consist of simply one plate of spring steel. These are usually thick {{in the middle and}} taper out toward the end, and they don't typically offer too much strength and suspension for towed vehicles. Drivers looking to tow heavier loads typically use multi leaf springs, which consist of several leaf springs of varying length stacked on top of each other. The shorter the leaf spring, the closer to the bottom it will be, giving it the same semielliptical shape a single leaf spring gets from being thicker in the middle. The objective {{of this paper is to}} Predict the fatigue life cycle for crack initiation at maximum stress location in the Leaf spring [...] The design constraints are stresses and deflections. The aim of this project is to study exist ing semi elliptic leaf spring and optimize the critical part like <b>eye,</b> <b>bolt</b> etc. to minimize the overall weight of the assembly without hampering its structural strength. It also involves geometrical and finite element modeling of existing design and optimized design. Geometrical modeling is carried out by using CATIA V 5 and finite modeling in ANSYS 14. 0. Results of Static, and fatigue analysis of existing design and optimized design are compared. The optimization is carried out by changing the material for semi elliptic leaf spring. The material used semi-elliptic leaf spring is...|$|E
