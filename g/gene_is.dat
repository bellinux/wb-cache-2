5|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF), {{a progressive}} multi-system lung disease, {{has been considered}} {{in the search for}} a genetic cause of DPB. This is for a number of reasons. CF, like DPB, causes severe lung inflammation, abundant mucus production, infection, and shows a genetic predominance among Caucasians of one geographic group to the rarity of others; whereas DPB dominates among East Asians, CF mainly affects individuals of European descent. While no gene has been implicated as the cause of DPB, mutation in a specific genemuch more likely to occur in Europeanscauses CF. This mutation in the CF-causing <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> not a factor in DPB, but a unique polymorphism (variation) in this <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> known to occur in many Asians not necessarily affected by either disease. It is being investigated whether this gene in any state of mutation could contribute to DPB.|$|E

5|$|Neural {{precursor}} cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 9 (NEDD-9) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NEDD9 gene. NEDD-9 {{is also known}} as enhancer of filamentation 1 (EF1), CRK-associated substrate-related protein (CAS-L), and Cas scaffolding protein family member 2 (CASS2). An important paralog of this <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> BCAR1.|$|E
50|$|Filtering of {{non-significant}} <b>genes</b> <b>is</b> done so {{that analysis}} {{can be done}} on selected <b>genes.</b> Non-significant <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> removed by specifying relative change in expression with respect to normal control. Values for over-expressed and under-expressed <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> defined as 2 and &minus;2 respectively. As a result of filtering, few <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> retained. Those remaining <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> then subjected to statistical analysis.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  6 c, the {{comparison}} of RP and GP revealed that 794 <b>genes</b> <b>were</b> significantly up regulated and 555 <b>genes</b> <b>were</b> down regulated. The number of up regulated <b>genes</b> <b>was</b> more than down regulated genes. In these 1349 DEGs, 1285 <b>genes</b> <b>were</b> annotated at least in one database.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the terms}} being {{commonly}} interchanged, not all homeotic <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> Hox genes; the MADS-box <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> homeotic but not Hox genes. Thus, the Hox <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> {{a subset of}} homeotic genes.|$|R
5|$|The genetic {{mutations}} most {{commonly associated with}} endometrioid adenocarcinoma are in the genes PTEN, a tumor suppressor; PIK3CA, a kinase; KRAS, a GTPase that functions in signal transduction; and CTNNB1, involved in adhesion and cell signaling. The CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> most commonly mutated in the squamous subtype of endometrioid adenocarcinoma.|$|E
5|$|A broad {{operational}} definition is sometimes used {{to encompass the}} complexity of these diverse phenomena, where a <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> defined as a union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping functional products. This definition categorizes genes by their functional products (proteins or RNA) rather than their specific DNA loci, with regulatory elements classified as gene-associated regions.|$|E
5|$|A <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> a {{sequence}} of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino-acid sequences of proteins {{is determined by the}} rules of translation, known collectively as the genetic code. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called codons formed from {{a sequence}} of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).|$|E

5|$|A typical protein-coding <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> first copied into RNA as an {{intermediate}} {{in the manufacture of}} the final protein product. In other cases, the RNA molecules are the actual functional products, as in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA. Some RNAs known as ribozymes are capable of enzymatic function, and microRNA has a regulatory role. The DNA sequences from which such RNAs are transcribed are known as non-coding RNA genes.|$|E
5|$|All {{humans have}} {{two copies of}} the Huntingtin gene (HTT), which codes for the protein Huntingtin (HTT). The <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> also called HD and IT15, which stands for 'interesting {{transcript}} 15'. Part of this <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> a repeated section called a trinucleotide repeat, which varies in length between individuals and may change length between generations. If the repeat is present in a healthy gene, a dynamic mutation may increase the repeat count and result in a defective gene. When the length of this repeated section reaches a certain threshold, it produces an altered form of the protein, called mutant Huntingtin protein (mHTT). The differing functions of these proteins are the cause of pathological changes which in turn cause the disease symptoms. The Huntington's disease mutation is genetically dominant and almost fully penetrant: mutation of either of a person's HTT alleles causes the disease. It is not inherited according to sex, but {{the length of the}} repeated section of the gene and hence its severity can be influenced by the sex of the affected parent.|$|E
5|$|Apo{{lipoprotein}} B, in its ApoB100 form, is {{the main}} apolipoprotein, or protein part of the lipoprotein particle. Its <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> located on the second chromosome (2p24-p23) and is between 21.08 and 21.12Mb long. FH {{is often associated with}} the mutation of R3500Q, which causes replacement of arginine by glutamine at position 3500. The mutation is located on a part of the protein that normally binds with the LDL receptor, and binding is reduced {{as a result of the}} mutation. Like LDLR, the number of abnormal copies determines the severity of the hypercholesterolemia.|$|E
3000|$|... 805 and 198 <b>genes</b> <b>were</b> {{identified}} that were differentially expressed in leaves and roots, respectively.

5|$|Both of the Russian Toy {{varieties}} can be {{crossed and}} produce smooth- and long-coated puppies {{from the same}} litter. In addition, when two smooth-coated dogs are bred together, they may occasionally bear a long-coated offspring if the long hair <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> present in their pedigrees. However, {{there have been no}} records of two long-coated Russian Toys breeding together and producing smooth-coated offspring.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises a <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> difficult. Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do not necessarily have {{to be close to}} the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can be much larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome.|$|E
5|$|HD is one {{of several}} trinucleotide repeat {{disorders}} which are caused by the length of a repeated section of a gene exceeding a normal range. The HTT <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> located on the short arm of chromosome 4 at 4p16.3. HTT contains a sequence of three DNA bases—cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG)—repeated multiple times (i.e.... CAGCAGCAG...), known as a trinucleotide repeat. CAG is the 3-letter genetic code (codon) for the amino acid glutamine, so a series of them results in the production of a chain of glutamine known as a polyglutamine tract (or polyQ tract), and the repeated part of the gene, the PolyQ region.|$|E

50|$|The {{affected}} <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> {{divided into}} two broad categories. Oncogenes <b>are</b> <b>genes</b> that promote cell growth and reproduction. Tumor suppressor <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> <b>genes</b> that inhibit cell division and survival. Malignant transformation can occur through the formation of novel oncogenes, the inappropriate over-expression of normal oncogenes, or by the under-expression or disabling of tumor suppressor genes. Typically, changes in multiple <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell.|$|R
5|$|HHT is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} by definition. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, {{which means that}} an affected person carries one abnormal gene with a 50% chance of passing this gene to offspring. Those with HHT symptoms that have no relatives with the disease may have a new mutation. It seems that carrying two abnormal copies of the <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> not compatible with life, and hence no homozygotes have been described.|$|E
5|$|It was {{believed}} {{as late as}} 2002 that Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines (NSML) was related to neurofibromatosis type I (von Recklinghausen syndrome). In fact, since both ICD9 and ICD10 lack a specific diagnosis code for NSML, the diagnosis code for NF1 is still sometimes used for diagnostic purposes, {{although it has been}} shown that the <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> not linked to the NF1 locus.|$|E
5|$|Mutations in the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene {{were linked}} to {{autosomal}} dominant (i.e. requiring only one abnormal copy) FH in a 2003 report.
