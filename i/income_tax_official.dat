40|$|Recent {{advances}} in encryption schemes have {{allowed us to}} go far beyond point to point encryption, the scenario typically envisioned in public key encryption. In particular, Functional Encryption (FE) allows an authority to provide users with keys corresponding to various func-tions, such that a user with a secret key corresponding to a function f, can compute f(m) (and only that) from a cipher-text that encrypts m. While FE {{is a very powerful}} primitive, a key downside is the requirement of a central point of trust. FE requires the assumption of a central trusted authority which performs the system setup as well as manages the credentials of every party in the system on an ongoing basis. This is in contrast to public key infrastructure which may have multiple certificate authorities and allows a party to have different (and varying) level of trust in them. In this work, we address this issue of trust in two ways: ◦ First, we ask how realistic it is to have a central authority that manages all credentials and is trusted by everyone? For example, one may need to either obtain the permission of an <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>official</b> or the permission of the police department and a court judge i...|$|E

The tweet received an adversely storming response from Mahesh Babu's fans, who launched a scathing attack on her online and targeted abuse at the actress. Her opinions were later backed by actor Siddharth and directors Sekhar Kammula and Nandini Reddy, who also resultantly faced similar abuse, before Mahesh Babu apologised.
