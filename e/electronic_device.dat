5|$|An {{offshoot}} of the work at MIT {{was the beginning of}} digital circuit design theory by one of Bush's graduate students, Claude Shannon. Working on the analytical engine, Shannon described the application of Boolean algebra to electronic circuits in his landmark master's thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits. In 1935, Bush was approached by OP-20-G, which was searching for an <b>electronic</b> <b>device</b> to aid in codebreaking. Bush was paid a $10,000 fee to design the Rapid Analytical Machine (RAM). The project went over budget and was not delivered until 1938, when it was found to be unreliable in service. Nonetheless, it was an important step toward creating such a device.|$|E
5|$|At the FBI Academy, Dana Scully reads Mulder's initial report. The only {{connection}} between the murders that he can see is that the suspects all destroyed an <b>electronic</b> <b>device</b> during the killings. Meanwhile, Bonnie McRoberts, another Franklin resident, drops by a repair shop {{to pick up her}} car, where a message on an engine diagnostic display warns her that the mechanic is going to rape her. She impulsively kills him with an oil can spout. When Mulder and Spencer question her the next morning, her kitchen microwave instructs her to kill them. When she grabs a knife and attacks Mulder, she is shot and killed by Spencer.|$|E

He is picked up by Wint and Kidd, and taken out to Las Vegas Valley, where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die. The pipeline is buried the next morning.|$|E

There are other systems such as ICCF numeric notation for international correspondence chess and the obsolete descriptive chess notation.

5|$|Bond escapes {{and calls}} Blofeld, using a similar <b>electronic</b> <b>device</b> made by Q to pose as Saxby.

Saxby {{attempts}} to kill Bond outside the summer house, but is fatally shot during the ensuring gunfight. In the meantime, Blofeld abducts Case. With the help of Whyte, Bond raids the lab and uncovers Blofeld's plot to create a laser satellite using the diamonds, which by now has already been sent into orbit. With the satellite, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the Soviet Union and the United States, then proposes an international auction for global nuclear supremacy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} two days of 1999, Los Angeles has become a {{dangerous}} war zone. As a group of criminals rob a Chinese restaurant, the event is recorded by a robber wearing a SQUID, an illegal <b>electronic</b> <b>device</b> that records events directly from the wearer's cerebral cortex, and when played back through a MiniDisc-like device, allows a user to experience the recorder's memories and physical sensations. Lenny Nero, a former LAPD officer turned black marketeer of SQUID recordings, agrees to buy the robbery clip from his main supplier, Tick. Elsewhere, a prostitute named Iris, who is a friend of Lenny's ex-girlfriend Faith Justin, is being chased by LAPD officers Burton Steckler and Dwayne Engelman as she flees to the subway. Iris manages to escape on a rapid transit after her wig is pulled off by Engleman, revealing a SQUID recorder headset.|$|E
25|$|All <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> emit {{electromagnetic}} radiation.

5|$|The {{specific}} {{access method}} {{will depend on}} the skills and abilities of the user. With direct selection a body part, pointer, adapted mouse, joystick, or eye tracking could be used, whereas switch access scanning is often used for indirect selection. Unlike direct selection (e.g., typing on a keyboard, touching a screen), users of Target Scanning can only make selections when the scanning indicator (or cursor) of the <b>electronic</b> <b>device</b> is on the desired choice. Those who are unable to point typically calibrate their eyes to use eye gaze as a way to point and blocking as a way to select desired words and phrases. The speed and pattern of scanning, as well as the way items are selected, are individualized to the physical, visual and cognitive capabilities of the user.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourth}} round, a Japanese player (Tang Tang) was {{forfeited}} {{after he was}} caught with an <b>electronic</b> <b>device</b> in a random check conducted prior to leaving the venue. The game result was reversed from a win for the player to a loss, which also resulted in {{a change in the}} match score. Chief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov said that he was approached by an arbiter in the anti-cheating department and informed about the matter. He himself did not bother to check if there was a chess program installed on the device, as possession already violated the rules, leading to an automatic forfeiture. Later information from other arbiters involved indicated there possibly were two devices involved, and their quick check did not indicate a chess program was running. Without sufficient evidence of cheating per se, Hasanov felt that more than game disqualification would be double punishment. The captain of the Japanese team GM Mihajlo Stojanović later addressed some of the related issues in comments on the blog of the Macedonian grandmaster and general secretary of the Association of Chess Professionals Aleksandar Čolooviḱ.|$|E

5|$|The {{space station}} {{is divided into}} {{multiple}} sections connected by trams and elevators. Each section is composed {{of a set of}} rooms and corridors separated by doors. Some doors require certain actions to be performed first before entry is allowed. For example, some doors require a keycard or a numbered entry code, while others need to be cut with a variety of welding torches or hacked using an <b>electronic</b> <b>device.</b> The player may also encounter computer terminals {{that can be used to}} access information or trigger in-game actions like disabling security cameras or manipulating the space station's air-purification mechanism. The game features an automap to help players navigate the different areas of the game. To save their progress, players need to locate a terminal in the game and manually insert Amanda's access card in it. If Amanda dies, the player will need to start the game again from the last saved point. In addition to the campaign mode, Alien: Isolation features a separate game mode, called Survivor Mode, that focuses on short, player-versus-alien scenarios. In each scenario, the player needs to complete a set of objectives while avoiding the alien under a time limit.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Adolescents spend {{increasingly}} {{more time on}} <b>electronic</b> <b>devices,</b> and sleep deficiency rising in adolescents constitutes a major public health concern. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate daytime screen use and use of <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> before bedtime in relation to sleep. Design: A large cross-sectional population-based survey study from 2012, the youth@hordaland study, in Hordaland County in Norway. Setting: Cross-sectional general community-based study. Participants: 9846 adolescents from three age cohorts aged 16 – 19. The main independent variables were type and frequency of <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> at bedtime and hours of screen-time during leisure time. Outcomes: Sleep variables calculated based on self-report including bedtime, rise time, time in bed, sleep duration, sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset. Results: Adolescents spent a large amount of time during the day and at bedtime using <b>electronic</b> <b>devices.</b> Daytime and bedtime use of <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> were both related to sleep measures, with an increased risk of short sleep duration, long sleep onset latency and increased sleep deficiency. A dose–response relationship emerged between sleep duration and use of <b>electronic</b> <b>devices,</b> exemplified by the association between PC use and risk of less than 5  h of sleep (OR= 2. 70, 95 % CI 2. 14 to 3. 39), and comparable lower odds for 7 – 8  h of sleep (OR= 1. 64, 95 % CI 1. 38 to 1. 96). Conclusions: Use of <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> is frequent in adolescence, during the day as well as at bedtime. The results demonstrate a negative relation between use of technology and sleep, suggesting that recommendations on healthy media use could include restrictions on <b>electronic</b> <b>devices.</b> </p...|$|R
