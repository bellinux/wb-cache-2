5|$|Octopus blood {{contains}} the copper-rich protein haemocyanin to transport oxygen. This makes the blood very viscous {{and it requires}} considerable pressure to pump it round the body; octopuses' blood pressures can exceed 75 mmHg. In cold conditions with low oxygen levels, haemocyanin transports oxygen more efficiently than <b>haemoglobin.</b> The haemocyanin is dissolved in the plasma instead of being carried within blood cells, and gives the blood a bluish colour.|$|E
5|$|While diving, {{the emperor}} penguin's oxygen use is {{markedly}} reduced, as its heart rate {{is reduced to}} as low as 15–20 beats per minute and non-essential organs are shut down, thus facilitating longer dives. Its <b>haemoglobin</b> and myoglobin are able to bind and transport oxygen at low blood concentrations; this allows the bird to function with very low oxygen levels that would otherwise result in loss of consciousness.|$|E

Physiochemical characterization of the three product <b>haemoglobins</b> show them to be in the 'native' state. Oxygen-binding studies show that, under what are usually considered physiological conditions, each of the embryonic <b>haemoglobins</b> shows a high oxygen affinity, coupled to a high degree of co-operativity. Allosteric modulation of the oxygen-binding properties of the three <b>haemoglobins</b> in response to organic phosphates and protons has been investigated.

5|$|Many ligand {{transport}} proteins bind particular small biomolecules {{and transport}} {{them to other}} locations {{in the body of}} a multicellular organism. These proteins must have a high binding affinity when their ligand is present in high concentrations, but must also release the ligand when it is present at low concentrations in the target tissues. The canonical example of a ligand-binding protein is <b>haemoglobin,</b> which transports oxygen from the lungs to other organs and tissues in all vertebrates and has close homologs in every biological kingdom. Lectins are sugar-binding proteins which are highly specific for their sugar moieties. Lectins typically play a role in biological recognition phenomena involving cells and proteins. Receptors and hormones are highly specific binding proteins.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin became {{notable for}} a scandal {{involving}} the emerging trend of blood doping, {{the use of}} blood transfusions or synthetic hormones such as Erythropoietin (EPO) to improve oxygen flow and thus reduce fatigue. The Italian police conducted a raid on the Austrian cross-country ski team's residence during the Games where they seized blood-doping specimens and equipment. This event followed the pre-Olympics suspension of 12 cross-country skiers who tested positive for unusually high levels of <b>haemoglobin,</b> which is evidence of blood doping.|$|E
5|$|When submerged, a crocodilian's {{heart rate}} slows {{down to one}} or two beats a minute, and blood flow to the muscles is reduced. When it rises and takes a breath, its heart rate speeds up in seconds, and the muscles receive newly oxygenated blood. Unlike many marine mammals, {{crocodilians}} have little myoglobin to store oxygen in their muscles. During diving, muscles are supplied with oxygen when an increasing concentration of bicarbonate ions causes <b>haemoglobin</b> in the blood to release oxygen.|$|E

The rates of oxygen dissociation from the embryonic <b>haemoglobins</b> have been measured and appear to be responsible for the high oxygen-binding affinity associated with the embryonic proteins compared with the adult protein. The pH dependence of the oxygen dissociation rate constants also accounts for the rather unusual, previously described, Bohr effects characteristic of the embryonic <b>haemoglobins.</b> A general scheme has been developed coupling both the dimer-tetramer equilibria and ligand-binding steps observed following photolysis of the liganded forms of the {{human embryonic}} <b>haemoglobins...</b>|$|R

5|$|The South Wales Coalfield {{produced}} the sought-after anthracite, bituminous and steam coals—the latter a grade {{between the two}} comprising a hard coal without the coking elements. Some of the region's coal seams contained high quantities of firedamp, a highly explosive gas consisting of methane and hydrogen, and were therefore prone to explosions; firedamp rises into the higher points of workings, including cavities or, as at Senghenydd, when the seams were being mined in an upward gradient. An additional danger of firedamp is afterdamp, a poisonous mixture of gases left after an explosion, primarily constituted of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen. They combine with <b>haemoglobin</b> in the bloodstream to stop cells carrying oxygen, which can result in suffocation by lack of oxygen or anoxia. If survivors from an explosion are not rescued quickly, they face {{the possibility of being}} killed by the gas. The presence of firedamp contributed to a higher-than-average proportion of accidents: between 1880 and 1900 South Wales accounted for 18% of Britain's miners, but 48 per cent of all UK mining deaths occurred in the region. As coal output from British collieries reached its peak in 1913 there was a correspondingly large number of accidents around this time.|$|E

Sickle-cell <b>haemoglobin</b> (HgbS) and <b>haemoglobin</b> C with sickling (HgbSC)—the two most common forms—can be identified from there. The diagnosis can be confirmed with high-performance liquid chromatography. Genetic testing is rarely performed, as other investigations are highly specific for HbS and HbC.|$|E
25|$|Aerobic diving {{capacity}} {{is limited by}} available oxygen and {{the rate at which}} it is consumed.

40|$|The 2 -on- 2 <b>haemoglobins,</b> {{previously}} named truncated, are monomeric, {{low molecular}} weight oxygen-binding proteins that share the overall topology with vertebrate <b>haemoglobins.</b> Although several studies on 2 -on- 2 <b>haemoglobins</b> have been reported, their physiological and biochemical functions are not yet well defined, and various roles have been suggested. The genome of the psychrophilic Antarctic marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125 (PhTAC 125) is endowed with three genes encoding 2 -on- 2 <b>haemoglobins.</b> To investigate the function played {{by one of the}} three trHbs, PhHbO, a PhTAC 125 genomic mutant strain was constructed, in which the encoding gene was knocked out. The mutant strain was grown under controlled conditions and several aspects of bacterium physiology were compared with those of wild-type cells when dissolved oxygen pressure in solution and growth temperature were changed. Interestingly, inactivation of the PhHbO encoding gene makes the mutant bacterial strain sensitive to high solution oxygen pressure, to H 2 O 2, and to a nitrosating agent, suggesting the involvement of PhHbO in oxidative and nitrosative stress resistance...|$|R

40|$|Background: Neonatal {{screening}} for abnormal <b>haemoglobins</b> {{has been reported}} as an important intervention in early detection and prompt management {{for those who are}} significantly affected and those who are carriers. If associated with clinical care programmes, they have proven to be an important measure at decreasing mortality and morbidity in many regions, as well as providing genetic counselling to parents who are contemplating having children. Objectives: To determine the frequency of occurrence and types of abnormal <b>haemoglobins</b> in neonates attended at Muhimbili National Hospital, Dar es Salaam. Materials and Methods: A hospital based cross sectional design was used to recruit neonates attended at MNH from September to November 2009. Eligible neonates were consecutively enrolled after their parents provided informed consent for participation. A structured interview proforma was used to collect information while blood specimens were drawn into EDT A with microgard closure tubes from a heel prick under aseptic techniques. Blood specimens were analysed by HPLC to determine abnormal <b>haemoglobins</b> in whole blood; Alkaline Hb electrophoresis as a second line (confirmatory) test for positive results from HPLC; and ABX PENTRA 60 for haematological parameters (CBC) analysis were used. SPSS version 16. 0 was used for data analysis. Results: A total of 2, 053 neonatal samples (mean age = 1. 2 ± 0. 5 days and 55. 4 % males) were analyzed. The frequency of occurrence of abnormal <b>haemoglobins</b> was found to be 18. 2 % (n= 374). The types of abnormal <b>haemoglobins</b> included 12. 6 % (n= 258) with sickle cell trait (Hb FAS); 5. 3 % (n= 109) with possibly a-thalassaemia (Hb Barts); 0. 9 % (n= 19) as sickle cell carrier or Hb S Bcta-thalassacmia (Hb FSA); 0. 54 % (n=ll) had SCA or Hb S BetaO-thalassaemia (Hb FS); and one had Hb FA-D variant. The frequency of occurrence of abnormal <b>haemoglobins</b> were highest among 35. 6 % (n= 133) and 10. 2 % (n= 38) of participants whose parents origins were reported from Costal Region and Lake Zone respectively, while 6. 7 % (n= 25) of participants from the Northern Region of Tanzania had the lowest frequency of occurrence (X 2 = 37. 7, P < 0. 01). 	 Vlll Presence of Hb Barts increased by nearly six times the likelihood of MCV being less than 100 f 1 in 78. 2 % (n= 68) of participants compared to 14 %(n= 206) without Barts (X 2 = 2. 3, p<O. Ol); and increased by 1. 3 the likelihood of low birth weight in 33. 9 % (n= 37) compared to 25. 4 % (n= 493) of those without Barts (X 2 = 7. 1 p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The frequency of occurrence of abnormal <b>haemoglobins</b> amongst neonates participated in the study is high and therefore it may be considered as major public health problem. There are other Hb variants such as Hb Bart, FSA and Hb-D variant which exist amongst study population in addition to FS and F AS which were previously known. Recommendations: Neonatal {{screening for}} abnormal <b>haemoglobins</b> should widely be implemented to allow for early identification and opportunities for comprehensive care. Molecular tests to confirm abnormal <b>haemoglobins</b> detected during screening programme should be emphasized. Larger neonatal cohort studies to generalize the findings of this screening pilot are also recommended...|$|R
40|$|Purpose-To {{develop a}} {{non-invasive}} method for quantification {{of blood and}} pigment distributions across the posterior pole of the fundus from multispectral images using a computer-generated reflectance model of the fundus. Methods - A computer model was developed to simulate light interaction with the fundus at different wavelengths. The distribution of macular pigment (MP) and retinal <b>haemoglobins</b> in the fundus was obtained by comparing the model predictions with multispectral image data at each pixel. Fundus images were acquired from 16 healthy subjects from various ethnic backgrounds and parametric maps showing the distribution of MP and of retinal <b>haemoglobins</b> throughout the posterior pole were computed. Results - The relative distributions of MP and retinal <b>haemoglobins</b> in the subjects were successfully derived from multispectral images acquired at wavelengths 507, 525, 552, 585, 596, and 611 ?nm, providing certain conditions were met and eye movement between exposures was minimal. Recovery of other fundus pigments was not feasible and further development of the imaging technique and refinement of the software are necessary to understand the full potential of multispectral retinal image analysis. Conclusion - The distributions of MP and retinal <b>haemoglobins</b> obtained in this preliminary investigation are in good agreement with published data on normal subjects. The ongoing development of the imaging system should allow for absolute parameter values to be computed. A further study will investigate subjects with known pathologies to determine {{the effectiveness of the}} method as a screening and diagnostic tool...|$|R
40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is {{a highly}} {{reactive}} signalling molecule that has numerous targets in plants. Both enzymatic and non-enzymatic synthesis of NO has been detected in several plant species, and NO functions have been characterized during diverse physiological processes such as plant growth, development, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. This wide variety of effects reflects the basic signalling mechanisms that are utilized by virtually all mammalian and plant cells and suggests the necessity of detoxification mechanisms to control the level and functions of NO. During {{the last two years}} an increasing number of reports have implicated non-symbiotic <b>haemoglobins</b> as the key enzymatic system for NO scavenging in plants, indicating that the primordial function of <b>haemoglobins</b> may well be to protect against nitrosative stress and to modulate NO signalling functions.

40|$|The binding {{of oxygen}} {{to the three}} human {{embryonic}} <b>haemoglobins,</b> at pH 7. 4, {{has been shown to}} occur as a co-operative process. Analysis of oxygen-binding curves obtained in the absence of organic phosphate allosteric effectors shows that the process can be described quite accurately by the two-state model of allosteric action. In the presence of organic phosphates, the binding affinity for oxygen to the T-state of the alpha 2 epsilon 2 and zeta 2 epsilon 2 <b>haemoglobins</b> is significantly lowered. The values of the best-fit two-state parameters determined for each of the embryonic <b>haemoglobins</b> together with the temperature-dependence of the overall equilibrium binding process are discussed in terms of oxygen transfer from the maternal blood supply. Fast-reaction studies have been used to determine the rate constants of the oxygen association and dissociation processes occurring in the R-state and the rate of the allosteric R > T conformational transition.

In both cases, with or without the dye, the intermediate <b>haemoglobins</b> were found to be present at (alpha 3 +beta 2 +) 2 and (alpha 2 +beta 3 +) 2 valency hybrids from their characteristic position on electrophoresis, but amounts changed consecutively with time. The amount of (alpha 3 +beta 2 +) 2 was always greater than that of the (alpha 2 +beta 3 +) 2 valency hybrid. This result is explained by the differences in redox potentials between alpha- and beta-chains in methaemoglobin tetramer. It was concluded that methaemoglobin was reduced in human erythrocytes through these two different pats: methaemoglobin leads to k+ 3 (alpha 2 +beta 3 +) 2 leads to k+ 3 oxyhaemoglobin.
