5|$|During World War I, the German {{government}} {{hoped to}} destabilize British rule over India by spreading {{rumors that the}} British were unable to redeem for silver all of the paper currency they had printed. These rumors, and hoarding of silver, caused the price of silver to rise and risked damaging the British war effort. The British turned to their war ally, the United States, asking to purchase silver to increase the supply and lower the price. In response, Congress passed the Pittman Act of April 23, 1918. This statute gave the United States authority to sell metal to the British government from up to 350,000,000 silver dollars at $1 per ounce of silver plus {{the value of the}} copper in the coins, and <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> <b>transportation</b> fees. Only 270,232,722 coins were melted for sale to the British, but this represented 47% of all Morgan dollars struck to that point. The Treasury was required by the terms of the Act to strike new silver dollars to replace the coins that were melted, and to strike them from silver purchased from American mining companies.|$|E

25|$|Scientists at the Pune-based High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL) {{have already}} {{synthesised}} an adequate quantity of CL-20, the new explosive, in their laboratory. The compound, 'Indian CL-20' or 'ICL-20', was indigenously developed in HEMRL using inverse technology. CL-20 is a Nitramine class of explosive 15 times {{as powerful as}} HMX. HMX itself is {{more than four times}} as potent as RDX. CL-20-based Shaped Charges significantly improve the penetration of armour and could potentially be used in the bomb for the 120-mm main gun mounted on the MBT Arjun tanks. The CL-20, due to its reduced sensitivity enables easy <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> <b>transportation</b> and reduces the chances of mishap and loss to men, money, materials and machines.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{into the}} {{development}} of powered flight, some manufacturers were beginning to consider the use of metal in airframes to replace wood. Metal structures, even fabric-covered metal frames, offered greater robustness for <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> <b>transportation</b> as well as better resistance to tropical climates, and some designers could see the possibilities of metal skinning, stressed or not, for aerodynamically-clean cantilever wings and advanced monocoque fuselages. There was a realisation too, that mild steel, familiar from bicycle manufacture but with a low strength-to-weight ratio, {{was not going to}} be the material of choice once the problems of joining aluminium alloy members together and preventing their corrosion had been solved. Vickers in the UK were one of the first to make steel-framed and sparred aircraft that flew, with their series of R.E.P-type monoplanes no.s 1-8 produced between 1911 and 1913. In Germany, Junkers produced the first true all-metal (for years, aircraft with fabric-clad metal frames were described as all-metal, but the Junkers was steel-skinned as well) aircraft, the Junkers J.1, flown in 1915. Bristol's first draft designs for metal aircraft date from 1914, but it was not until the increase of aircraft production during the First World War began to put pressure on the supply of high-grade timber that there was official interest. During 1916 Bristol's designer, Frank Barnwell submitted a design for a metal two-seat reconnaissance aircraft, the M.R.1 (M.R. for Metal Reconnaissance) and gained a contract for two evaluation aircraft.|$|E

Production of adrenocorticotrophin, as measured by interrenal ascorbic acid and serum cortisol levels, did not occur in transported or planted fish. Dead or moribund fish collected from stream or live boxes comprised 13 percent of the 2, 000 fish planted. Aeromonas salmonicida, the causative agent of furunculosis, was isolated from 41 percent of 106 moribund fish sampled. In addition, 39 percent of the samples exhibited bacterial growth other than A. salmonicida.

The modulating effects of ascorbic acid (AA), vitamin E (E), and {{a combination of}} AA and E (AA + E) against eight-hour road transportation stress were investigated in 120 pullets during the hot-dry season. The result obtained showed that <b>handling,</b> loading <b>and</b> <b>transportation</b> induced lymphopenia, neutrophilia, liveweight loss, and mortality, which was alleviated by oral administration of AA, E, and AA + E at doses of 60 mg, 30 mg, and 60 + 30 mg per kg bodyweight, respectively, 30 minutes before being loaded and transported. The meteorological conditions recorded {{during the study period}} were higher (P <. 05) than the thermoneutral values established for chickens in the zone.
