The {{parliamentary}} clock had a peculiarity which I was not aware of at the time --a peculiarity which exists in no other clock, and would not exist in that one if it had been made by a sane person; on the half-hour it strikes the succeeding hour, then strikes the hour again, at the proper time. I lay reading and smoking awhile; then, when I could hold my eyes open no longer and was about to put out the light, the great clock began to boom, and I counted ten. <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Waterbury to see how it was getting along. It was marking 9.30. It seemed rather poor speed for a three-dollar watch, but I supposed that the climate was affecting it.

This was too much speed for the money, and it troubled me. I pushed the hands back a half hour, and waited once more; I had to, for I was vexed and restless now, and my sleepiness was gone. By and by the great clock struck 11. The Waterbury was marking 10.30. I pushed it ahead half an hour, with some show of temper. By and by the great clock struck 11 again. The Waterbury showed up 11.30, now, and I beat her brains out against the bedstead. I was sorry next day, when I found out.|$|E

40|$|Postavke rada temelje se na istraživanju povijesti i pojava unutar upravnoga kotara Nova Gradiška od 1886. do 1914., djelovanju njegovih institucija i svakodnevnog života njegovih stanovnika. Proučavanjem upravnih, obrazovnih, ekološko-zdravstvenih te socijalno-ekonomskih aspekata društva, stvoreni su okviri za razumijevanje pojma „svakodnevnog“ koji se uvodi kao sinonim za sveukupnost kapilarnih struktura i pojava života stanovnika novogradiškoga kotara. Povezujući povijesne pojave sa životnom svakodnevicom, ostvaren je sustavan pregled značajki prostora i ljudi u vremenskom periodu od dvadesetak godina. Nadalje, pomoću modela relacija mikro – makro i makro – makro, primijenjenih na obrađenim objektima istraživanja, pokušalo se utvrditi postoje li zakonitosti te kakav je bio odnos lokalnoga, regionalnoga i pokrajinskog konteksta. Korištenjem metodološke paradigme bazirane na kronološko-problemskom pristupu, multiperspektivnosti i vertikalnoj te horizontalnoj usporedbi podataka o kotaru Nova Gradiška s sličnim i većim upravnim jedinicama odgovorilo se na pitanje kako je bio organiziran život u kotaru Nova Gradiška. Tematski gledano, ovaj rad istražuje područje širega novogradiškoga kraja koji je nastao sjedinjenjem općine Cernik i dijela Gradiškog okružja 1886. u jedinstven kotar Nova Gradiška kao dio Požeške županije. U području školstva, zdravstva, gospodarstva i uprave, potvrđene su hipoteze, a u području demografije i modernizacije one su opovrgnute dok se u segmentu ekologije pojavio novi aspekt istraživanja. Istraživanjem specifičnih objekata, stvorena je baza za razumijevanje procesa i pojava koji su započeli krajem 19. ili početkom 20. stoljeća, a manifestirali su se u svojoj punini tek u suvremeno doba: poput sukoba Hrvata i Srba na tom području ili, posebice, važnosti uloge Andrije Štampara koji je svoje prve ideje formirao tijekom djelovanja u novogradiškom kotaru. Uvođenjem nekih rubnih tema koje dosad nisu istraživane, poput ekološko-zdravstvene historije ili humanitarnih dimenzija povijesti, sagledana je na drugačije perspektiva malog čovjeka u sveukupnosti života u jednom razdoblju novogradiške prošlosti. Premises of {{this thesis}} {{are based on}} the {{research}} of history and phenomenons in the Nova Gradiška administrative district from 1886. till 1914., work of its institutions and everyday life of its population. By studying administrative, economic, educational, ecological, health and social - economic aspects of the society the framework was created for understanding the term "everyday", which is introduced as a synonym for the totality of capillary structures and appearances of life for the population of Nova Gradiška district. Pervading and connecting historical phenomenon with everyday life and peoples features through a short time period of twenty years systematic overview of the area was created. With the help of micro - macro and macro - macro relations applied on processed objects of research it was tried to determine the existence of legality and what was the true nature of regional and broader national context. Considering the material, objects of the research were district institutions, population, marginal and privileged groups, factories and a number of different economic, social and ecological appearances in the district area of Nova Gradiška. For more efficient development of the crucial thesis these objects were put in following correlations: individual ↔ institution, village ↔ market town, market town ↔ district, district ↔ county, district ↔ district, market town ↔ town and district ↔ province. Topic of this thesis is researching a broader area of Nova Gradiška from 1886. till 1914. The area around Nova Gradiška was divided administratively and functionally since the forming of Slavonian military border in 1745. till the repeal of Gradiška regiment in 1871., in 1886. it was placed under Požega county and united with Cernik seigniory. In methodological context the thesis is based on the combination of chronological – problematic approach, multiperspectivity, interdisciplinarity and horizontal – vertical comparison of quantitive data. Because of the use of different materials, it was necessary to widen the horizon in understanding of certain areas, so <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> accomplishments in other areas of science, like art history, ethnology, museology and medicine. In every chapter of the thesis I tried to observe the topic from different perspective of macro and micro relations, from the dominant perspective of institutions and also from the perspective of an individual. Because of that I used multiperspectivity the same as private collections of materials, so all the findings can be interpreted on different levels. This research was focused on a number of questions and working hypothesis, and all of them were subjected to a common denominator of horizontal and vertical comparison of Nova Gradiska district with smaller, similar and bigger administrative units. By understanding the main hypothesis of the co-dependency between the Nova Gradiska district and Brod district, Pozega county and Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia, we can understand how life in Nova Gradiska district was organized. By horizontal comparison of data from Nova Gradiska district and data from Brod district, and vertical comparison of data from Nova Gradiska district and Pozega county and Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia, throughout all the chapters of thesis an authenticity and similarity in ways of functioning were observed. Administrative activity of Nova Gradiska district was a result of professional and political activity of the administration, and was completely under provincial and county verification. In political context Nova Gradiska district was under the events happening on a state, province and county level {{with the exception of the}} period 1895. – 1905. when the political actions were under the influence of city of Brod. During that period the Club of the Party of Rights and working movement was organized. Bad coexistence of Croats and Serbs in the area of Nova Gradiska district was transformed because of the common political interests and activity of Croatian – Serbian coalition in cooperation, which brought a late victory at elections during 1908. in Nova Gradiska district. The high treason process wasn’t directly accepted as negative in the Nova Gradiska district, but was understood in the context of what it was: manipulative tool for justifying the annexation of Bosnia and Hercegovina. Nova Gradiska district didn’t follow the demographic trends of transition since on its area the communities were homogenous with the higher rate of marriages, higher birth and higher mortality rates. The co-dependency of the man and nature in Nova Gradiska district was noticed in both directions, mans influence on nature and natures on man. In the beginning of the first industry activities at Cernik seigniory, as a result of cutting down the forest appear a land erosion causing flood and hunger. On the other hand with inadequate regulation of river Sava, a flood was caused in Posavina, and due to its slow withdrawal to river bed the population was exposed to diseases and hunger. As a surprising element in research the connection between human inadequate repairs and landscaping with the appearance of floods and hunger was noticed. Economic activity of Nova Gradiska district didn’t deviate from the whole Pozega County. The same as in Pozega County, the majority of the population was working in the primary sector, Nova Gradiska district didn’t wholly follow all the economical tendencies of the region, nor the Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia, so the growth of the district was slower. Nova Gradiska district was more similar, in cattle breeding for example, to Daruvar, Novska and Pakrac district then to Pozega and Brod district. In comparison to Pozega district, Nova Gradiska district had more family-household structures which were adopting harder to individual managing, in comparison to Brod area, Nova Gradiska district became more isolated with the termination of steamship station in Stara Gradiska in 1892. Nova Gradiska district experienced the economical growth from 1890. till 1900. when they started with bigger exploitation of natural resources, organizing more industrial complexes, housing bigger populations of workers and organizing the Economy exhibition of 1894. Nova Gradiska district wasn’t developing enough in the period from 1900. till 1910. – it became more backward then Brod district and average in comparation with Pozega county and whole Kingdome. In the end of 19 th and the beginning of 20 th century Nova Gradiska district was mostly rural area, oriented on primary sector, especially on cattle and plum export. Due to inadequate adjustment to the market, the ratio of population working in secondary and tertiary sectors wasn’t growing fast enough, which resulted in the whole area not being economically competitive enough in regional and broader context of Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia. Educational and health system were founded on the quality legacy inherited from the period of Military Border when every company place had a school, the same as was the military hospital built it 1846. Although the education system was modernized with school adaptation, population literacy and bigger percentage of female children in education, the main problem was school absence, which had continuity from the 18 th century. Health system was modernized with hospital adaptation, employment of adequate medical staff and compulsory health check ups for students. Bad social – economic conditions had an influence on the appearance of diseases and hunger. Population of the district was predominantly falling ill from malaria and trachoma, mostly from inadequate rehabilitation of wetlands, or terrible hygienic conditions. Bad economical conditions, destruction of the vine and the change in interest to plum cultivation, existence of a large number of entrepreneurs who were in plum cultivation and alcohol production, resulted in growth of pure ethanol production in the district area. All of the above influenced on a bigger consumption of alcohol drinks. The interesting part in studying the question of alcoholism is in the fact that in the broader regional area of Slavonia, including Nova Gradiska also, the problem of alcoholism obviously existed also in the 18 th century, since it is mentioned also by Matija Antun Relkovic. Alcoholism was recognized as an issue in Nova Gradiska district during 1906. what led to establishment of the first anti alcoholic newspaper. From the total number of anti alcoholic members’ in Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia, 20...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to study literary representations of Eastern Europe {{in the works of}} celebrated and less-known American authors, who visited and narrated the region between the mid- 1960 s and early 2000 s. The main critical body focuses on Eastern Europe before 1989 and encompasses three major voices of American literature: John Updike, Joyce Carol Oates, and Philip Roth. However, in the last chapter I also explore American literary perceptions of the area following the collapse of communism. Importantly, the term “Eastern Europe” as used in this dissertation is charged with significance. I approach it not only as a space on the map or the geopolitical construct which emerged {{in the aftermath of the}} Second World War, but rather as a conceptual category and a repository of meanings built out of fact and fantasy: specific historical, political and cultural realities interlaced with subjective worldviews, preconceptions, and mental images. The critical framework of this dissertation is twofold. <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> concept of liminality to elucidate the indeterminacy and malleability which lies at the heart of the object of study—the idea, image, and experience of Eastern Europe. Bearing in mind the nature of the works under analysis, all of which were inspired by actual visits behind the Iron Curtain, I propose to interpret these transatlantic literary journeys in terms of generative experience, where Eastern Europe is mapped as a liminal space of possibility; a contact zone between cultures and, potentially, the locus of self-discovery and individual transformation. If liminality is the metaphor or a lens that I employ in order to account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> nature of the analyzed works and the complex terrain they map, imagology, whose purpose is to study the processes of constructing selfhood and otherness in literature, provides me with the method and <b>the</b> critical vocabulary <b>for</b> analyzing selected literary representations. The dissertation is divided into six chapters, the last of which serves as coda to the previous discussion. The first two chapters constitute the critical foundation of this work. Then, in chapters 3, 4, and 5 I study American images of Eastern Europe in the works written by John Updike, Joyce Carol Oates, and Philip Roth, respectively. The last, sixth chapter of this dissertation is divided into two parts. In the first one, I discuss new critical perspectives and avenues of research in the study of Eastern Europe following the collapse of communism. Then, I carry out a joint analysis of four works written after 1989 by Eva Hoffman, Arthur Phillips, John Beckman, and Gary Shteyngart. The dissertation ends with conclusions in which I summarize my findings and reflections, and suggest implications for future research. As this dissertation seeks to demonstrate, Eastern Europe portrayed in the analyzed works oscillates between contradictory representations which are contingent upon a number of factors, most importantly who maps it and in what context. Even though each experience of Eastern Europe is distinct and fueled by the profiles, identities, and interests of the characters and their creators, I have found out that certain patterns of othering are present in all the works. Thus, my research seems to suggest that there is something of a recurrent literary image of Eastern Europe, which goes beyond the context of the Cold War. Accordingly, while this dissertation hopes to be a valid contribution to the study of literary and cultural mappings of Eastern Europe, it also generates new questions regarding the current, post-communist representation of the area and its relationship to the national tropes explored in my work...|$|R

Day I flew up to Denmark with Kelly, a West Indian pilot who was a close friend. As we climbed over Belsen, we saw the flame-throwing Bren carriers trundling through the camp - burning it to the ground. Our light Bf 108 rocked in the superheated air, as we sped above the curling smoke, and Kelly had the last words on it."Thank Christ for that," [...] he said, fervently.And his words sounded like a benediction.|$|R
60|$|So I {{was glad}} that those {{particular}} outlaws had journeyed south, and was even more pleased when <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> coulée, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cold was increasing and the ride had grown inexpressibly dreary. It was warmer down in the hollow among the trees, but so black {{that it was the}} horse rather than I that avoided them, while now and then a branch lashed my forehead like a whip. There were cypress among them resembling solid masses of gloom, and the wind howled weirdly; but at last I blundered up the winding trail into sight of Carrington Manor. The big log-and-frame-built house was dark and silent, and though I knew that at least the majority of its inhabitants were at Lone Hollow the sight depressed me. Then, just as we drew clear of the trees, I checked <b>the</b> horse, <b>for,</b> silhouetted blackly against the sky, a single mounted figure kept watch over it. Perhaps it was instinctive caution, or it may have been that Grace's uneasiness had infected me, but I led Jasper's horse back into the coulée and hitched him to a tree, then, unslinging the rifle, stood still shivering as I watched the figure.|$|R

I guess we shall fix Brother Gerrish yet, and I don't think we shall let Brother Peck off without a tussle. I'm going to try print on Brother Gerrish.

40|$|Murine natural killer (NK) cells express {{inhibitory}} Ly 49 receptors for MHC class I molecules, {{which allows}} for "missing self" recognition of cells that downregulate MHC class I expression. During murine NK cell development, host MHC class I molecules impose an "educating impact" on the NK cell pool. As a result, mice with different MHC class I expression display different frequency distributions of Ly 49 receptor combinations on NK cells. Two models have been put forward to explain this impact. The two-step selection model proposes a stochastic Ly 49 receptor expression followed by selection for NK cells expressing appropriate receptor combinations. The sequential model, on the other hand, proposes that each NK cell sequentially expresses Ly 49 receptors until an interaction of sufficient magnitude with self-class <b>I</b> MHC is <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> NK cell to mature. With the aim to clarify which one of these models {{is most likely to}} reflect the actual biological process, we simulated the two educational schemes by mathematical modelling, and fitted the results to Ly 49 expression patterns, which were analyzed in mice expressing single MHC class I molecules. Our results favour the two-step selection model over the sequential model. Furthermore, the MHC class I environment favoured maturation of NK cells expressing one or a few self receptors, suggesting a possible step of positive selection in NK cell education. Based on the predicted Ly 49 binding preferences revealed by the model, we also propose, that Ly 49 receptors are more promiscuous than previously thought in their interactions with MHC class I molecules, which was supported by functional studies of NK cell subsets expressing individual Ly 49 receptors...|$|R
