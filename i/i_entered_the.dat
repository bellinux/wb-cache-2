25|$|When I {{became a}} member of the law firm of Steger, Thurmond and Rayburn, Messrs. Thurmond and Steger were {{representing}} the Santa Fe Railroad Company, receiving pay monthly. When the first check came after <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to my desk one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. I said to him that I was a member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had taught me that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.|$|E

25|$|De Gaulle {{was not an}} {{outstanding}} pupil until his mid teens, but from July 1906 he worked harder at school as he focussed on winning a place to train as an army officer at the military academy, Saint-Cyr. Lacouture suggests that de Gaulle joined the Army, despite being by inclination more suited to {{a career as a}} writer and historian, partly to please his father and partly because {{it was one of the}} few unifying forces which represented the whole of French society. He later wrote that “when <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> Army, it was one of the greatest things in the world”, a claim which Lacouture points out needs to be treated with caution: the Army's reputation was at a low ebb in the early 1900s after the Dreyfus Affair. It was used extensively for strike-breaking and there were fewer than 700 applicants for St Cyr in 1908, down from 2,000 at the turn of the century.|$|E

As <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> camp, a scraggy dog hit me square between the {{shoulders}} and knocked me over! I’d never been {{so glad to see}} the old girl. And I think she felt the same!" [...] After four weeks at the new camp, they were moved back to Sumatra by paddle steamer. They had been told that it was a [...] "special mission" [...] to pick fruit. Instead they spent a year in Sumatra, with the Japanese using the men to cut through the jungle to lay railway track. Rations were a handful of maggot-ridden tapioca a day, which Frank continued to share with Judy. She also proved useful in conducting trades with the locals, as she would indicate when someone was hiding near to the track. Her barking deliberately alerted the guards to when there was something too large for her to handle in the jungle, such as tigers or elephants.|$|E

2500|$|The film {{became a}} {{favorite}} of the filmmakers of the French New Wave whose films contain many allusions to Vigo's work. The French director François Truffaut {{fell in love with it}} when he saw it at age 14 in 1946: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> theater, I didn't even know who Jean Vigo was. I was immediately overwhelmed with wild enthusiasm for his work." [...] Yugoslavian film director Emir Kusturica has said he is a big admirer of Vigo's work and describes Vigo as a poet. This admiration is best shown in Kusturica's Underground where the underwater scenes are very reminiscent of those from L'Atalante. Other films to pay tribute to L'Atalante include Bernardo Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris, Leos Carax's Les Amants du Pont-Neuf, and Jean-Luc Godard's In Praise of Love.|$|E

2500|$|In 1514, Selim I {{attacked}} Ismail's kingdom to {{stop the}} spread of Shiism into Ottoman dominions. Selim and Ismā'il had been exchanging a series of belligerent letters prior to the attack. Selim I defeated Ismā'il at the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514. Ismā'il's army was more mobile and their soldiers were better prepared, but the Ottomans prevailed due in large part to their efficient modern army, possession of artillery, black powder and muskets. Ismā'il was wounded and almost captured in battle, and Selim <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> Iranian capital of Tabriz in triumph on September 5, but did not linger. The Battle of Chaldiran was of historical significance, as the reluctance of Shah Ismail to accept the advantages of modern firearms and the importance of artillery was decisive. After the battle, Selim, referring to Ismail, stated that his adversary was: [...] "Always drunk to the point of losing his mind and totally neglectful of the affairs of the state".|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. When <b>I</b> <b>entered,</b> <b>the</b> place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. I noticed that the soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance we saw a broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. I noticed the schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It looked as if it had crouched down during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. When he saw me and my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. I went over and asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then shrugged and sighed. [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] I gave him a rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I noticed something that I would see again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if I remember correctly. The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E
