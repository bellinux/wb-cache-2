5|$|During archaeological {{investigation}} of the ballcourt a well-preserved tennoned ballgame marker was found placed on the western bench. Its original placement was indicated by {{a hole in the}} upper part of the ballcourt wall. The second marker that would have been placed directly opposite the first has never been found and the area of the ballcourt wall where it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>had</b> collapsed prior to excavations. Replicas of the ballcourt marker have been placed in both walls; the original is in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City.|$|E
5|$|The strikers {{have gained}} {{absolutely}} nothing by the movement. The ten per cent reduction has been {{enforced by the}} four trunk lines, and the only concessions were those that might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>had</b> for asking, without {{the loss of a}} single day's work. Such of the strikers as were caught committing criminal acts are now under arrest, and the great majority of the rest are most anxious to resume their places. Some of the railroad companies have discharged every man that took part in the strike, while others have only dropped the ringleaders, and have held out inducements to the others to return to work.|$|E

25|$|Pakistan won the toss {{and chose}} to field in cloudy conditions. This {{proved to be}} a good decision, as Pakistan's seamers Umar Gul and Mohammad Asif took eight wickets between them on the way to bowling England out for 173.

25|$|It {{was never}} a success financially. In fact, we lost money, if I {{remember}} correctly, on every single release bar one. I did quite like it but it was terribly indulgent. Not as indulgent as it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>had</b> I not had a business partner, admittedly... I liked having a label. It enabled you to put out stuff that you liked without, in those days, {{having to worry about}} whether it was going to work commercially. I've never been a good business man.|$|E

25|$|These rules use area scoring, {{and have}} a komi of 6.5. Black has one further point deducted {{in the event that}} White was the first player to pass in the game. This last feature is a {{compromise}} with Japanese and Korean rules in that it is similar, in terms of its strategic consequences, to territory scoring. Unlike the Chinese rules, this rule will generally impose a penalty for an additional move {{at the end of the}} game within one's territory. In particular, the result of the game may differ by up to a point from what it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>had</b> both players played it out.|$|E
25|$|However, Charmley {{dismisses the}} {{concerns}} of contemporaries such as Charles Webster and Lord Cecil of Chelwood that Bevin, a man of very strong personality, was “in {{the hands of his}} officials”. Charmley argues that much of Bevin's success came because he shared the views of those officials: his earlier career had left him with an intense dislike of communists, whom he regarded as workshy intellectuals whose attempts to infiltrate trade unions were to be resisted. His former Private Secretary Oliver Harvey thought Bevin’s staunchly anti-Soviet policy was what Eden’s would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>had</b> he not been hamstrung, as at Potsdam, by Churchill’s occasional susceptibility to Stalin’s flattery, whilst Cadogan thought Bevin “pretty sound on the whole”.|$|E
25|$|At that time, the men's {{basketball}} team at Indiana was coached by future Hall of Fame coach Bobby Knight. While Knight {{was not a}} direct influence on VanDerveer's choice of school, he may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>had</b> an indirect effect. The Indiana women's coach, Bea Gorton, patterned her style of play and practices after Knight, {{and it was the}} observation of the style of play at the AIAW event that persuaded her to choose Indiana. The effect would become more direct. Because Gorton designed her practices based upon what she observed from Knight, VanDerveer started attending Knight's practices to see what she would be doing later that day in practice. VanDerveer carried what she learned from Knight to her practices at Stanford.|$|E

25|$|The first HM V tram, number 1, was {{delivered}} to the HKL on 27 April 1959, with number 15 delivered last in the series on 23 October 1959. Coinciding with the delivery of these new trams the HKL had decided to reset their numbering scheme. Therefore, the HM V trams were numbered starting from one and not from 376, as they would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>had</b> the old numbering been continued. The HM V trams were built to be compatible with the HP II type trailers that had been constructed in 195859, also by Karia. The usage of trailers in Helsinki ended in 1983, although the couplers needed for hauling trailers were retained in the HM V type trams for many years afterwards, number 14 being the last tram to have one, with the coupler removed only in 2006.|$|E
25|$|With stylometric {{approaches}} it {{is possible}} to identify certain characteristics which are very typical of Shakespeare, {{such as the use of}} particular poetic techniques or the frequency with which various common words are used, and these have been used to argue that Marlowe could not have written Shakespeare's works. In every case so far where these data have been plotted over time, however, Marlowe's corpus has been found to fit just where Shakespeare's would <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> <b>had</b> he written anything before the early 1590s as all of Marlowe's were. On the other hand, whereas stylometry might be useful in discerning where two sets of work are not by the same person, it can be used with less confidence to show that they are. This was something that T.C. Mendenhall, whose work some Marlovians have nevertheless thought proves their theory, was at pains to point out.|$|E
25|$|Studying {{earthquakes}} {{has shown}} to be a difficult task when considering all the limitations created by natural disasters. Clinical interviews are difficult because of the widespread damage to infrastructure and roads, which leads to reliance on self-report. Self-report can introduce bias to results, leading to skewed data. Researchers are unable to reliably compare an individual's mental health status to their health status previous to the trauma because they must rely on retrospective self-report. Retrospective self-report is affected greatly by the individual's current state of distress. The displacement of large numbers of citizens following a trauma poses as a problem for researchers of natural disasters. It is predicted {{that the people who are}} displaced experience the worst of the damage, and therefore the reported levels of PTSD and depression are often lower than they would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>had</b> the displaced citizens been available to collect data from. Because large number of citizens are being displaced, it is difficult to find a representative sample population. For example, after the Christchurch earthquakes, studies reported that older educated females of European New Zealand descent were over represented in their sample population, which isn't accurate of the Christchurch population as a whole.|$|E

500|$|Gustave Flaubert {{was also}} {{substantially}} influenced by Balzac. Praising {{his portrayal of}} society while attacking his prose style, Flaubert once wrote: [...] "What a man he would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>had</b> he known how to write!" [...] While he disdained the label of [...] "realist", Flaubert clearly took heed of Balzac's close attention to detail and unvarnished depictions of bourgeois life. This influence shows in Flaubert's work L'éducation sentimentale which owes a debt to Balzac's Illusions Perdues. [...] "What Balzac started", observes Lehan, [...] "Flaubert helped finish".|$|E
500|$|Since these Games {{were the}} first since World War II they were given the name [...] "The Games of Renewal."

Meghan Deans of Tor.com felt that, while the episode did unfortunately reduce Scully down to a traditional idea of feminine identity for part of its run, it was [...] "one of the most emotional Scully-centric episodes the show has ever given us." [...] Furthermore, Deans reasoned that the episode was an example of [...] "what The X-Files would <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> <b>had</b> Scully been the believer: a woman being told that she is hysterical, a woman being told that she imagined it all [...] a woman being told that the evidence of her own body is invalid", a direction that would have been [...] "startling [...] ".|$|E
