5|$|All of the Lancasters had {{completed}} their attacks by 11:07am GMT, and the 21 bombers began the return journey to Yagodnik. The Force A aircraft {{which had not}} been able to bomb brought their Tallboys back. This flight proved uneventful, and all 27 Lancasters landed at Yagodnik in the evening. The Film Unit aircraft flew directly from Kaafjord to the United Kingdom, and arrived at its <b>home</b> <b>station</b> after a fifteen-and-a-half hour flight; this was the longest operational Lancaster mission of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Emerald {{was still}} {{serving on the}} <b>Home</b> <b>Station</b> on 11 April 1811 when she sent into Cork a French privateer. This was the 18-gun Auguste (or Augusta), which had been taken on 6 April. Nearly a month later, on 5 July, Emerald left Madeira {{in the company of}} five East Indiamen and was still on convoy duties later that month when a {{transport}} ship spotted her escorting thirteen vessels off the coast of West Africa on 18 July.|$|E
5|$|From November 2009 until November 2010, the 173rd Airborne Brigade {{once again}} {{returned}} to Afghanistan, {{this time to}} the provinces of Logar and Wardak. With combat experience already earned in other similar mountain regions in 2007 and 2008, the Brigade distinguished itself in combat regularly against the Taliban and fought tenaciously against them, while still promoting and attempting to legitimize the Afghan government. The 1st and 2nd Battalions saw extensive action in eastern Logar and Wardak. The 1/91st Cavalry was given a mission to transform western Logar province into a secure environment; a mission that was not greeted as an easy task. Given the province and its three major districts saw a massive influx of both foreign and domestic fighters due to the relatively calm winter prior to the brigade's arrival, its company-sized and platoon-sized elements found themselves in combat against anti-Coalition forces almost daily {{from the start of}} March 2010 until its relief. The brigade returned to its <b>home</b> <b>station</b> in Europe in November 2010. Seven soldiers from the brigade lost their lives during the deployment.|$|E

5|$|Operation Dracula was a {{complete}} success, as Japanese forces had actually vacated Rangoon several days prior to the amphibious landing; 36th Indian Infantry Brigade was able to occupy the city without encountering any Japanese opposition. Shortly after Rangoon's occupation Japanese forces called for a cease-fire, and plans for the amphibious landing in Western Malaya and an advance into Singapore were cancelled. Instead, British and Commonwealth forces landed unopposed and liberated those areas, and also temporarily occupied Thailand. On 3 May the composite battalion moved to Sadainghmut, and two days later, leaving one company behind, it was transferred to Rangoon where it conducted anti-looting operations and also searched for Japanese stragglers remaining in the city. It left the city on 16 May and travelled to India by ship, where it rejoined 44th Indian Airborne Division. It had been the division's first major airborne operation. The 2nd Air Commando Group's C-47s, which had transported the parachute battalion, returned to Kalaikunda and then moved to Comilla. The 317th Tactical Control Squadron {{spent the next two}} weeks supplying XV Corps who were engaged with Japanese forces northeast of Rangoon and returned to Kalaikunda on 19 May. The group's fighter squadrons provided air cover for Rangoon until 9 May when they too returned to <b>home</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 173rd {{participated in}} various {{operations}} {{with the objective}} of ensuring security and subduing Taliban insurgents in the mountainous regions along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan, near the Hindu Kush. Throughout their 15-month deployment, the brigade participated in more than 9,000 patrols throughout the region. Journalist Sebastian Junger and photographer Tim Hetherington were embedded with Battle Company of 2nd Battalion which saw extensive action in the Korengal Valley. Junger later wrote a highly acclaimed book, War, and, with Hetherington, produced the award-winning documentary, Restrepo, about the deployment. Only two weeks before the brigade was to return to Europe, a platoon of 45 soldiers from the brigade stationed in the Dara-I-Pech district was attacked by a large force of insurgents during the Battle of Wanat. Though the platoon was able to drive the insurgents back with air support, the fight resulted in 9 soldiers killed and 16 wounded; the deadliest attack on troops in the country since 2005. The brigade repositioned the base three days later. The 173rd's tour ended in July 2008, and the last redeploying paratrooper from the brigade returned to Europe by the beginning of August 2008. 42 soldiers from the brigade lost their lives during the deployment. The brigade returned to Europe and <b>home</b> <b>station</b> after once again proving itself in combat throughout the eastern mountains of Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major change}} {{was the primary}} <b>home</b> <b>station</b> for most Patriots regular season games. Since 1965, they had aired on WBZ-TV, Boston's {{longtime}} NBC affiliate. After owner Westinghouse Broadcasting switched the station's affiliation to CBS, WHDH-TV took on airing the NFL on NBC package locally.|$|E

25|$|Later {{that year}} Scorpion {{captured}} three French privateers {{while on the}} <b>Home</b> <b>station.</b> On 16 February it was the Bougainville, some 12 miles south-west of the Isles of Scilly. She had 16 guns and 93 men and was 23 days out of Saint-Malo. Capturing her took a long chase and a 45-minute running fight during which the privateer lost several of crew killed; Scorpion had no casualties.|$|E
25|$|Deployed from 39th Air Division, Misawa Air Base, Japan.

Inactivated in place. Later reactivated as an RF-4C squadron on 15 October 1971 with the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, Bergstrom AFB, Texas.|$|E

During a visit to the Worcester studios, Andrew was asked if he'd like to be trained as a broadcast assistant – and three weeks later, without the training, Andrew was looking after the general day-to-day running of the Hereford office.|$|E

25|$|The game's soundtrack {{features}} about 170 licensed tracks accessible across twelve in-game {{radio stations}} while driving or at <b>home.</b> <b>Station</b> genres include alternative rock, reggae, hip hop, heavy metal, funk, R and 1980s pop, with {{artists such as}} Opeth, Duran Duran, Lamb of God, The Used, My Chemical Romance, Avenged Sevenfold, Paramore, Panic! at the Disco and Run-D.M.C.

25|$|The Hurricane Hunters of the Air Force Reserve are {{distinct}} {{from those of}} the Department of Commerce's NOAA Hurricane Hunters, based at Lakeland Linder Regional Airport, Florida, who use a pair of Lockheed WP-3D Orion and a Gulfstream IV-SP aircraft to also fly weather reconnaissance, data collection and scientific research missions. In accordance with its memorandum of agreement with NOAA, AFRC maintains a capability in the 53d WRS for five sorties per day from its <b>home</b> <b>station</b> and two deployed locations in support of requirements for the National Hurricane Operations Plan, or two sorties a day during winter storm seasons. The 53d also provides a subunit, the Chief, Aerial Reconnaissance Coordination, All Hurricanes ("CARCAH"), at the National Hurricane Center to coordinate the activities of both organizations.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, KRON-TV began {{broadcasting}} most Oakland Raiders games, {{which were}} at {{first part of}} the American Football League, which had a contract with NBC from 1965 to 1969, and then the National Football League's American Football Conference, which inherited the AFL's deal with NBC from 1970 to 1997 (the Raiders relocated to Los Angeles in 1982, stripping KRON of its status as the team's <b>home</b> <b>station</b> until they returned to Oakland in 1995). In 1967, KRON-FM-TV moved to a new studio at 1001 Van Ness Avenue in the Western Addition neighborhood (a location that formerly served as the site of the Roman Catholic cathedral of San Francisco), where channel 4 operated until 2014.
