25|$|In 2004 {{two more}} storm chaser tools emerged. The first, WxWorx, {{was a new}} XM Satellite Radio based system {{utilizing}} a special receiver and Baron Services weather software. Unlike preexisting cellular based services there was no risk of dead spots, and that meant {{that even in the}} most remote areas storm chasers still had a live <b>data</b> <b>feed.</b> The second tool was a new piece of software called GRLevel3. GRLevel3 utilized both free and subscription based raw radar files, displaying the data in a true vector format with GIS layering abilities. Since 2006 a growing number of chasers are using Spotter Network (SN), which uses GPS data to plot real time position of participating spotters and chasers, and allows observers to report significant weather as well as GIS layering for navigation maps, weather products, and the like.|$|E
