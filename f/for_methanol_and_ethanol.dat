This study combines measurements of the thermodynamics and kinetics of carbon dioxide, methanol, and ethanol sorption on adsorbents M and E over a range of temperatures with adsorbent structural characterization at different adsorbate (guest) loadings. The adsorption kinetics <b>for</b> <b>methanol</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethanol</b> adsorption on porous structure E obey a linear driving force (LDF) mass transfer model for adsorption at low surface coverage. The corresponding adsorption kinetics for porous structure M follow a double exponential (DE) model, {{which is consistent with}} two different barriers for diffusion through the windows and along the pores in the structure. The former is a high-energy barrier due to the opening of the windows in the structure, required to allow adsorption to occur, while the latter is a lower-energy barrier for diffusion in the pore cavities. X-ray diffraction studies at various methanol and ethanol loadings showed that the host porous structures E and M underwent different scissoring motions, leading to an increase in unit cell volume with the space group remaining unchanged during adsorption.

A thermodynamic model is developed {{to study the}} energy distribution of alternative fuels that is <b>methanol,</b> <b>ethanol,</b> iso- octane <b>and</b> liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The energy of the fuels are distributed with work, heat transfer through the wall and energy with the exhaust gases.

This study shows that the major portion of energy goes waste with the exhaust. The results also showed that the energy with the exhaust gases decreases {{with the increase in}} compression ratio and energy with work and heat transfer increases with the increase in compression ratio for all the fuels examined. The specific heats of all the fuels increase from compression to the combustion and decreases slightly during exhaust stroke.

The catalysts activities were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and by Tafel plots and {{the results showed that}} the activity towards methanol oxidation was highly dependent of the alloy degree, while for ethanol the presence of a metal capable to promote the break of C-C bond, such as Rh, was necessary for a good performance. Additionally, the catalysts containing of TaOx or PbOx resulted in the best materials due to different effects: the hi-functional mechanism promoted by TaOx and a better dispersion of the catalysts constituents promoted by PbOx.

40|$|Summary: Organic {{volatile}} impurities (OVIs), {{residual solvents}} in herbal formulations and extracts were monitored using gas chromatography (GC) with Flame Ionisation detector (FID). As per GMP, measuring residual solvents is mandatory. It {{is now possible}} {{to take advantage of}} GC equipment with faster temperature ramping capabilities, in combination with shorter capillary GC columns, to achieve considerable gain in efficiency and reduction in analysis time. In the present study Gas chromatographic method for the determination of <b>methanol,</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>and</b> isopropyl alcohol at residual levels in herbal formulations and extracts was developed using a flame ionization detector and the separation was carried out on BP 624 column (30 m X 0. 53 mm i. d. X 0. 25 µm coating thickness), using GC 17 A shimadzu, with nitrogen as carrier gas in the split mode by direct injection method. The retention time <b>for</b> standard <b>methanol,</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>and</b> isopropyl alcohol was found to be 3. 72, 5. 26 and 6. 28 min respectively. The linearity <b>for</b> <b>methanol,</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>and</b> isopropyl alcohol (IPA) was found to be in the range of 10 - 400 µLmL- 1, 10 - 500 µL mL- 1 and 1 - 240 µLmL- 1 respectively. The method was validated according  to ICH guidelines. The method described is simple, sensitive, rugged, reliable and reproducible for  the quantitation of <b>methanol,</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>and</b> isopropyl  levels from herbal formulations and extracts and their levels are found to be within the ICH limits. Industrial relevance: ICH guidelines have mentioned the limits for solvents according to their toxicity level. They have classified the solvents into four Classes, Class 1 limits 2, 4, 15 ppm for benzene, carbon tetrachloride and 1, 1, 1 -trichloro ethane. Class 2 solvents viz; methanol 3000 ppm, Class 3 <b>ethanol</b> <b>and</b> isopropyl alcohol 5000 ppm. Since various solvents have been used for the extraction, granulation, film coating, cleaning and miscellaneous. It is impossible to remove the residual solvents completely; they cause serious hazardous to human health, thus  determination of residual solvents has become mandatory to control the herbal extracts and formulation. Regulatory bodies have been very particular about the limits of various solvents. </p...|$|R
