25|$|Friends {{and family}} say Bethany <b>did</b> <b>her</b> <b>best</b> {{to keep in}} contact with them. But due to Bethany's busy life, {{balancing}} her classes in {{what was to be}} her final semester at GMU with a full-time job, they had gotten used to not hearing from her for several days at a time, so they were not worried as February 2011 began without any news from her. However, later in the month several of her friends called her mother, Kim Nelson, saying that they had received messages from her via her Facebook account that did not seem to them to have come from Bethany.|$|E
25|$|Isabella {{first came}} to Genoa City to {{distract}} Paul Williams {{as a favor to}} Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc), who wanted to break up Paul and his wife, Christine. Isabella approached Paul at his office with a case against her husband, which he took. Paul gave Isabella shelter, and the two were drawn to each other. Upon the ending of the case, Isabella's past as a call girl came out, but Paul forgave Isabella for lying, and they became even closer. Isabella was keen on leaving the city after the case was over, but both Michael and Paul had their reasons for keeping her in town. Isabella was surprised to learn that she was pregnant with Paul's child. Paul's marriage took another hit when Christine returned home to find him passionately kissing Isabella. However, Isabella didn't want Paul, and she decided to tell Michael that she was carrying his child after a night of passion that they had. Michael reluctantly agreed to pay for her expenses and went along with all of her demands, while Paul became closer to his ex-wife, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). Paul found out that he was the father of Isabella's child and decided to raise his son with her. Both Michael and Mary Williams (Carolyn Conwell), Paul's mother, were not happy to learn the truth. Mary <b>did</b> <b>her</b> <b>best</b> to break up the couple, and Paul eventually realized that he couldn't be one happy family with Isabella and their baby.|$|E
500|$|In his memoirs, written {{more than}} thirty years after her death, her father wrote of Elisabeth's [...] "deep sensitivity" [...] and [...] "very large heart." [...] He wrote that [...] "I never knew a child who had so much {{influence}} on adults. Her inner personality was very strong, and she had a natural quality that protected her from being spoiled." [...] In October 1901, after the death of Queen Victoria, Elisabeth's parents finally divorced. Her mother had rekindled a previous romance with another cousin, her future husband, Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich of Russia. Her father, according to letters written by her mother, had been caught cavorting with domestic servants. Her parents' divorce meant that Elisabeth divided her year between Darmstadt and her mother's new home in Coburg. Elisabeth was at first mistrustful of her mother and resented the divorce, although Victoria <b>did</b> <b>her</b> <b>best</b> to mend her relationship with her daughter during her visit with Elisabeth in the spring of 1902. She was only partially successful, though Victoria enjoyed turning her daughter into an outstanding horsewoman.|$|E

500|$|Francis II became king {{at the age}} of fifteen. In {{what has}} been called a coup d'état, the Cardinal of Lorraine and the Duke of Guise—whose niece, Mary, Queen of Scots, had married Francis the year before—seized power the day after Henry II's death and quickly moved {{themselves}} into the Louvre Palace with the young couple. The English ambassador reported a few days later that [...] "the house of Guise ruleth and doth all about the French king". For the moment, Catherine worked with the Guises out of necessity. She was not strictly entitled to a role in Francis's government, because he was deemed old enough to rule for himself. Nevertheless, all his official acts began with the words: [...] "This being the good pleasure of the Queen, my lady-mother, and I also approving of every opinion that she holdeth, am content and command that..." [...] Catherine did not hesitate to exploit her new authority. One of her first acts was to force Diane de Poitiers to hand over the crown jewels and return the Château de Chenonceau to the crown. She later <b>did</b> <b>her</b> <b>best</b> to efface or outdo Diane's building work there.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} general acclaim from critics. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times described the video {{as one of}} Knowles' best and most vivid. Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly described Knowles as [...] "one hot housewife in the [...] video". This was echoed by Tray Hova of Vibe magazine who stated that [...] "Beyoncé makes a mighty fine housewife". Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News said that she <b>did</b> <b>her</b> <b>best</b> impersonation of Betty Draper. The Music Network complimented {{the production of the}} video while simultaneously making reference to Christina Aguilera and criticising the latter for her new video for her single [...] "Not Myself Tonight", writing: [...] "...housework has never looked so good ... Proving you don't have to wear bondage gear and a ball-gag to be sexy (hello Christina!), the 50s-style video sees the R queen [...] getting dirty in a different way: dusting her Grammys, watering the plants and scrubbing the shower in vintage lingerie... She can come over to our house anytime." [...] Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard magazine commented on Knowles' [...] "dominatrix costume" [...] at the end to Rihanna's Rated R era. She finally complimented the music video by saying that [...] "Beyoncé's shamelessly campy performance—complete with boatloads of running mascara—is generously refreshing." [...] Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy noted that the video was [...] "kind of a tour de force" [...] and compared it with the one for [...] "Telephone" [...] (2010). He also noted that it showed [...] "Beyoncé {{on the edge of a}} nervous breakdown." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{quality of}} the {{magazine}} remained high even as the financial stress was mounting in the late 1970s. [...] White acquired cover artwork by Stephen Fabian and Douglas Beekman, and stories {{by some of the}} new generation of sf writers, such as George R. R. Martin and Charles Sheffield. [...] White departed in November 1978, but the first issue of Fantastic under Elinor Mavor's editorial control was April 1979. [...] Because White had returned unsold stories she had very little to work with and was forced to fill the magazine with reprints. [...] This led to renewed conflict with the sf community, which she <b>did</b> <b>her</b> <b>best</b> to defuse. [...] At a convention in 1979 she met Harlan Ellison, who complained about the reprint policy; she explained that it was temporary and was able to get him to agree to contribute stories, publishing two pieces by him in Amazing over the next three years. [...] The January 1980 issue of Fantastic (Mavor's fourth issue) was the last to contain reprinted stories. [...] Once the reprints had been phased out, Mavor was able to find new writers to work with, including Brad Linaweaver and John E. Stith, both of whom sold their first stories to Fantastic. [...] The last year of Fantastic showed [...] "a steady improvement in content", according to Mike Ashley, who cites in particular Daemon, a serialized graphic story, illustrated by Stephen Fabian. However, at the end of 1980 Fantastics independent existence ceased, and it was merged with Amazing.|$|E

500|$|When Elgar was twenty-nine, {{he took on}} a new pupil, Caroline Alice Roberts, {{daughter}} of the late Major-General Sir Henry Roberts, and a published author of verse and prose fiction. Eight years older than Elgar, Alice became his wife three years later. Elgar's biographer Michael Kennedy writes, [...] "Alice's family was horrified by her intention to marry an unknown musician who worked in a shop and was a Roman Catholic. She was disinherited." [...] They were married on 8 May 1889, at Brompton Oratory. From then until her death she acted as his business manager and social secretary, dealt with his mood swings and was a perceptive musical critic. She <b>did</b> <b>her</b> <b>best</b> to gain him the attention of influential society, though with limited success. In time he would learn to accept the honours given him, realising that they mattered more to her and her social class and recognising what she had given up to further his career. In her diary she wrote, [...] "The care of a genius is enough of a life work for any woman." [...] As an engagement present, Elgar dedicated his short violin and piano piece Salut d'Amour to her. With Alice's encouragement, the Elgars moved to London {{to be closer to}} the centre of British musical life, and Elgar started devoting his time to composition. Their only child, Carice Irene, was born at their home in West Kensington on 14 August 1890. Her name, revealed in Elgar's dedication of Salut d'Amour, was a contraction of her mother's names Caroline and Alice.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of Tuesday, March 18, Effie went to check on Joan after the doctor had left for the day. [...] She found Joan in a soiled nightgown; when she moved her to help her change into a fresh gown, Effie saw that Joan had been lying in dried feces. [...] Two towels had been placed under her due to a recent loose bowel {{movement}} that appeared to contain blood. The maid <b>did</b> <b>her</b> <b>best</b> to help Joan into the bathroom to clean her. [...] As she did this, Effie noticed that Joan's face began turning blue. [...] The maid hurriedly cleaned up Joan and the soiled bed and called to her husband, who also worked for the Hills, to phone Mrs. Hill's parents' home at once. When there was no answer, Archie Green tried unsuccessfully to reach John Hill at his office and left a message. [...] Rhea Robinson was unaware of Joan's condition when her husband dropped her off at the Hill home to visit her daughter.|$|E
2500|$|LeMay {{was born}} in Columbus, Ohio, on November 15, 1906. LeMay was of English and distant French Huguenot heritage. His father, Erving Edwin LeMay, was at times an {{ironworker}} and general handyman, but he never held a job longer than a few months. His mother, Arizona Dove (Carpenter) LeMay, <b>did</b> <b>her</b> <b>best</b> to hold her family together. With very limited income, his family moved around the country as his father looked for work, going as far as Montana and California. [...] Eventually they returned to his native city of Columbus. LeMay attended Columbus public schools, graduating from Columbus South High School, and studied civil engineering at Ohio State University. Working his way through college, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering. While at Ohio State {{he was a member}} of the National Society of Pershing Rifles and the Professional Engineering Fraternity Theta Tau. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Air Corps Reserve in October 1929. He received a regular commission in the United States Army Air Corps in January 1930. While finishing at Ohio State, he took flight training at Norton Field in Columbus, in 1931–32. On June 9, 1934, he married Helen Estelle Maitland (died 1992), with whom he had one child, Patricia Jane LeMay Lodge, known as Janie.|$|E
