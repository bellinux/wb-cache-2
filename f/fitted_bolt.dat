First of all, I chose from the catalog wire rope hoist. I proposed preliminary dimensions of mainbeam and crossbeam. I made strength check of mainbeam and crossbeam. For attachment mainbeam and crossbeam I chose <b>fitted</b> <b>bolts.</b> I calculated required number of <b>fitted</b> <b>bolts</b> M 12. From the standards I chose wheels. I checked the wheels to maximum contact pressure and service life. I chose bearings from catalog SKF. I checked the bearings to service life. I proposed dimension of shafts. From the rolling resistance and friction, I calculated the power output of the engine. At the last I proposed cable trolleys {{and control of the}} crane...|$|R

Injection bolts {{have proved to be}} a reliable and relative cheap alternative. Injection bolts are bolts in which the cavity produced by the clearance between the bolt and the wall of the hole is completely filled up with a two component resin. Rules for injection bolts have been included in the new European standards for constructional steelwork. In this paper details of this system and the field of application are presented. Also the design rules are shortly dicussed. Finally examples of successful application are given...|$|R

In the next part a proper rope hoist with appropriate engineering characteristics is selected. Then {{the design of the}} main girder follows. Its proportions are designated from the strength calculation, which are proved by check calculation. Another aim of this thesis is a project of the construction of the girder with a crossbeam, which is realized by <b>fitted</b> <b>bolts.</b> Their size is also calculated and controlled.

40|$|The {{interference}} fit {{is an effective}} process technique to improve the fatigue life of aircraft structures. In this article, the experiments including the interference <b>fit</b> <b>bolt</b> installation and tensile loading in bolted joint were carried out. A three-dimensional finite element model was established to simulate the experimental process, and the finite element model was validated by comparing the simulated data with the experimental data of the squeeze forces and the strains. By finite element simulation and analysis, {{it can be concluded}} that the location of maximum value of the maximum principal stress on the upper plate faying surface is going far away from the hole edge with the increase in {{interference fit}} size. Furthermore, by analyzing the hoop stress variations along a prescribed path, the maximum value of the hoop tensile stress is smallest at the interference fit size of 1. 5 %...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} new measured {{residual stress}} data for a ferritic weld bead on plate benchmark specimen. The contour residual stress measurement method was applied {{because it could}} provide an informative map on the plane of interest capable of quantifying local variations in residual stress associated with phase transformations. The quality of the contour cut was optimised by carrying out initial cutting trials to tune the electro-discharge machining cutting parameters. The risk of plasticity during the cutting procedure was minimised by using an “embedded crack” contour cutting configuration, clamping with <b>fitted</b> <b>bolts</b> and a large diameter cutting wire {{in order to reduce}} the crack opening and stress concentration at the cut tip. The results of the contour method measurement are in reasonable overall agreement with published stresses measured by neutron diffraction. However, certain features in the results suggest that significant plasticity did occur during the contour cut despite the specific measures taken to minimise this effect...|$|R
40|$|From the {{interference}} <b>fit</b> <b>bolt</b> installation to tensile loading stage in single-lap joint with a hi-lock bolt, {{the stress and}} strain fields were studied experimentally and numerically. A three-dimensional finite element model was generated to simulate the experimental setup, which was validated using the experimental data. The fatigue behavior of the bolted joint {{is influenced by the}} local stress fields on the faying surface near the holes in single-lap joints. Therefore, with the aim to improve design awareness, the effects of the parameters on the local stress fields were investigated by means of finite element simulation. With an increase in {{the interference}} fit size, the occurred position of the maximum stress values on the upper plate faying surface moves away from the hole edge gradually. As the clamping force or friction coefficient increases, the position of larger stress area is changed to the side of bearing load from the transverse direction. The lap geometry of the bolted joint as well as the amplitude of tensile load has apparent impact on the maximum stress value...|$|R

5000|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage of}} interchangeable sockets is that, {{instead of a}} separate wrench {{for each of the}} many different fastener sizes and types, only separate sockets are needed for each size and type. Because of their versatility, nearly all screw and bolt types now have sockets of different types made to <b>fit</b> their <b>bolts</b> or nuts. Sockets often come as a [...] "socket set" [...] with many different sizes or types of sockets to fit the heads of different-sized fasteners. A ratchet of the [...] "set size" [...] is often included with the socket set.

60|$|A hard brown old woodman who {{had been}} {{shooting}} vermin in the Abbey groves stepped forward with a grin of pleasure. After a lifetime of stoats and foxes, this was indeed a noble quarry which was to fall before him. <b>Fitting</b> a <b>bolt</b> on the nut of his taut crossbow, he had raised it to his shoulder and leveled it at the fierce, proud, disheveled head which tossed in savage freedom {{at the other side}} of the wall. His finger was crooked on the spring, when a blow from a whip struck the bow upward and the bolt flew harmless over the Abbey orchard, while the woodman shrank abashed from Nigel Loring's angry eyes.|$|R
60|$|Half an {{hour later}} the big {{cross-beam}} was in position and Charnock watched Festing <b>fit</b> the <b>bolt</b> into its fan-shaped socket. He did so with fastidious care and then standing on the beam swung the hammer a workman gave him. The blast-lamp roared upon a timber overhead, throwing down waves of light that flooded the rock face, but the twinkling brightness rather puzzled the eye. For all that, Festing struck the wedge squarely and drove it home with a few heavy blows. Then he fastened the cross-bolt and Charnock filled a ladle with the melted lead. A blue flame flickered about the cavity as he poured in the stuff, there was an angry sputtering, and he afterwards found some holes in his coat. Festing dropped his hammer with a gesture of satisfaction.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, to {{the truck}} and van {{department}} they went, and there Bob, whose mind was sharp as a needle, saw a good many pieces of mechanism, which formerly he had only seen in a transition state, now applied to their ultimate uses. The chiselled, sawn, and drilled planks seen in the first department, were here being <b>fitted</b> and <b>bolted</b> together {{in the form of}} trucks, while the uses of many strange pieces of iron, which had puzzled him in the blacksmiths' department, became obvious when fitted to their appropriate woodwork. Here, also, he saw the internal machinery of railway carriages laid bare, especially the position and shape of the springs that give elasticity to the buffers, which, he observed, were just the same in shape as ordinary carriage springs, placed so that the ends of the buffer-rods pressed against them.|$|R
50|$|Locking was {{achieved}} by a solid bolt head and three bolt lugs. The bolt head {{was designed to be}} removable thus allowing the owner to vary the head space by replacing the head. The bolt head is of the floating type whereby it is a loose <b>fit</b> in the <b>bolt</b> tube and held in place by a pin, the firing pin passing through a hole in that pin. This allows the locking lugs to self centre with even pressure when the action is locked.|$|R

The outer legs are thinner at the top, flaring towards the bottom. Held together, the three legs form a dovetail shape. The lewis hole seating is undercut (similar to a chain-linked lewis hole) to match its profile.|$|R

By means of boundary element analyses and cross-comparison with theory and photoelasticity, the load capacity of the bolt is ultimately related to a comprehensive notch factor which embodies both stress concentration and notch sensitivity dependencies. The notch factor is conveniently plotted as a function of nominal diameter and thread pitch for a selection of steel grades. The charts show that the endurance load slightly increases as the pitch is decreased for small bolts of low-grade steel. Conversely, the endurance load markedly increases with the pitch (improvements above 40 per cent can be achieved) for large bolts of high-grade steel...|$|R

40|$|The {{high-pressure}} oxidizer turbopump (HPOTP) {{consists of}} two centrifugal pumps, on a common shaft, that are directly driven by a hot-gas turbine. Pump shaft axial thrust is balanced in that the double-entry main inducer/impeller is inherently balanced and the thrusts of the preburner pump and turbine are nearly equal but opposite. Residual shaft thrust is controlled by a self-compensating, non-rubbing, balance piston. Shaft hang-up must be avoided if the balance piston is to perform properly. One potential cause of shaft hang-up is contact between the Phase 2 bearing support and axial spring cartridge of the HPOTP main pump housing. The status of the bearing support/axial spring cartridge interface is investigated under current loading conditions. An ANSYS version 4. 3, three-dimensional, finite element model was generated on Lockheed's VAX 11 / 785 computer. A nonlinear thermal analysis was then executed on the Marshall Space Flight Center Engineering Analysis Data System (EADS). These thermal results were then applied along with the interference <b>fit</b> and <b>bolt</b> preloads to the model as load conditions for a static analysis to determine the gap status of the bearing support/axial spring cartridge interface.

50|$|The {{stress and}} shear in a rivet is {{analyzed}} like a bolted joint. However, {{it is not}} wise to combine rivets with bolts and screws in the same joint. Rivets fill the hole where they are installed to establish a very tight fit (often called interference fit). It is difficult or impossible to obtain such a tight fit with other fasteners. The result is that rivets in the same joint with loose fasteners carry more of the load—they are effectively more stiff. The rivet can then fail before it can redistribute load to the other loose <b>fit</b> fasteners like <b>bolts</b> and screws. This often causes catastrophic failure of the joint when the fasteners unzip. In general, a joint composed of similar fasteners is the most efficient because all fasteners reach capacity simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|The engine, {{although}} {{rated at}} five litres and , was specially made to withstand racing conditions. The block was specially cast and crankcase was <b>fitted</b> with four <b>bolt</b> main bearing caps. The heads were revised with high-flow intake ports and roller rockers. Special connecting rods, crankshafts, and pistons were fitted {{as well as}} a custom exhaust. The key feature though was the fabled Walkinshaw twin throttle body inlet manifold, which had been specially developed for the Group A and featured sequential setup with a smaller and larger throttle body. This was fitted with a restrictor plate on the larger, secondary throttle body, which actually let less air through than the smaller throttle body. Some reports have indicated that as much as 50-60 horsepower can be gained from the removal of the restrictor plates.|$|R
5000|$|Most of the bolt-action designs use turn-bolt design which {{involves}} the shooters doing a [...] "turn + pull" [...] handle movement to unlock/open the bolt, cock {{the firing pin}} and cycle the cartridge. There are three major turning bolt-action system designs: the Mauser system, the Lee-Enfield system, and the Mosin-Nagant system. All three differ {{in the way the}} <b>bolt</b> <b>fits</b> into the receiver, how the bolt rotates as it is being operated, the number of locking lugs holding the bolt in place as the gun is fired, and whether the action is cocked on the opening of the bolt (as in the Mauser system) or the closing of the bolt (as in the Lee-Enfield system). The vast majority of bolt-action rifles utilize one of these three systems, with other designs seeing only limited use.|$|R
60|$|It was an {{important}} day on the Reef when the keel of the pinnace was laid. On examining his materials, Mark ascertained that the boat-builders had marked and numbered each portion of the frame, each plank, and everything else {{that belonged to the}} pinnace. Holes were bored, and everything had been done in the boat-yard that could be useful to those who, it was expected, were to put the work together in a distant part of the world. This greatly facilitated our new boat-builders' labours in the way of skill, besides having done so much of the actual toil to their hands. As soon as the keel was laid, Mark set up the frame, which came together with very little trouble. The wailes were then got out, and were fitted, each piece being bolted in its allotted place. As the work had already been put together, there was little or no dubbing necessary. Aware that the parts had once been accurately fitted to each other, Mark was careful not to disturb their arrangement by an unnecessary use of the adze, or broad-axe, experimenting and altering the positions of the timbers and planks; but, whenever he met with any obstacle, in preference to cutting and changing the materials themselves, he persevered until the parts came together as had been contemplated. By observing this caution, the whole frame was set up, the wailes were <b>fitted</b> and <b>bolted,</b> and the garboard-streak got on and secured, without taking off a particle of the wood, though a week was necessary to effect these desired objects.|$|R
