5|$|SpongeBob {{is often}} seen <b>hanging</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> his best friend Patrick, who lives on the same street as him.

SpongeBob's greatest goal in life is to receive his driver's license from Mrs. Puff's boat driving school, but he panics and crashes whenever he is in a boat.

40|$|Most {{studies of}} {{sedentary}} behavior {{have focused on}} television use or screen time. This study aims to examine adolescent girls' participation {{in a variety of}} recreational sedentary behaviors (e. g., talking on the phone and <b>hanging</b> <b>around),</b> and their association with physical activity (PA), dietary behaviors, and body mass index. Data were from a sample of 283 adolescent girls. Recreational sedentary behavior, PA, and dietary behaviors were self-reported, and girls' height and weight were measured. Over 95 % of girls engaged in at least one recreational sedentary behavior during the recall period. Watching television and <b>hanging</b> <b>around</b> were the most common behaviors. Watching television, using the Internet, and <b>hanging</b> <b>around</b> were associated <b>with</b> less PA; watching television, <b>hanging</b> <b>around,</b> and talking on the phone were associated with less healthful dietary behaviors. No associations were found with body mass index. Interventions may benefit from capitalizing on and intervening upon girls' common recreational sedentary behaviors...|$|R

5000|$|Other correspondents speculated about Lady Lavery's {{relationship}} with Michael Collins and Kevin O'Higgins. According to the memoirs of Derek Patmore, a writer, artist, and interior designer {{who was a}} close friend of Lady Lavery's, Collins was [...] "the great love in her life" [...] and that Sir Shane [...] "told me that when Michael Collins was killed in an ambush they found a miniature of Hazel <b>hanging</b> <b>around</b> his neck <b>with</b> a poem Shane Leslie had written to her on the back of it."Speculation about the relationship between Collins and Lady Lavery led a newspaper of the day to refer to her as his [...] "sweetheart", an issue Collins wrote to his fiance Kitty Kiernan about.

2500|$|However, in [...] "Alive on Broadway," [...] they {{introduced}} {{the notion that}} the fictional backstory may be meta-fictional—Kiki spoke of the duo actually being thousands of years old, implying that some of her previous stories were, at least in part, lies told by the character.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Australian journalist Nick Milligan on 25 March 2011, Anderson explained, [...] "I was in Los Angeles in 1989 recording an album which the 'Bound For Glory' single came off and I was <b>hanging</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> the Gunners {{and a lot of}} other LA bad boy rock bands that we supposedly influenced. I realised then that apart from the fact that I was there to establish myself as a singer songwriter, there was still this great following for the band. I rang up the other members and said 'Let's reform. We've been apart for three years or more.' It was long enough for us to settle our differences and let all the wounds heal. I rang up each of the original members that were still interested and they all said, 'Yeah, let's get together.' So I said we should negotiate a deal where the band can come over and record in Los Angeles. But, of course, that was the year that our original drummer [...] "Digger" [...] Royall kicked his heroin habit. While he was recovering on methadone, cancer exploded through his body, quite sadly. That was the irony of it, because the cancer had been suppressed by the heroin addiction. Within months he was dead. That shook the band so badly on a personal level, because we had been so enthusiastic to reform. We didn't reform until '92. In '93, the word got around, because we had reformed with our existing drummer Paul DeMarco. The Gunners heard we were out playing again and said, 'We want you to do our support gigs throughout Australia.' We did those two Guns N' Roses raceways gigs - Eastern Creek in Sydney and the raceway down in Melbourne." ...|$|E
5000|$|The single's three B-sides are {{a three-part}} {{storytelling}} {{the life of}} a woman named Susan. [...] "Stacks" [...] deals with her early adolescence in Rotherham, its chorus warning that there are much better ways to spend her time than <b>hanging</b> <b>around</b> and going <b>with</b> boys. In [...] "Inside Susan" [...] she is in her later teens, and the song is a spoken-word account of her thoughts as she travels on a bus (including recollections of a party where she got drunk on cider). Finally [...] "59 Lyndhurst Grove" [...] finds Susan the second wife of an architect [...] "somewhere in South London," [...] cheating on him with a lover and living a monotonous conventional life. It also recalls a party, though one much more reserved with friends and children.|$|R
5000|$|The Cleveland Show has {{received}} mixed reviews. Review aggregator Metacritic gave the show {{a score of}} 57 out of 100. Tom Shales of The Washington Post spoke very negatively about both the show and MacFarlane himself, describing him as [...] "no better than the dirty old man <b>hanging</b> <b>around</b> playgrounds <b>with</b> naughty pictures or risque jokes as lures". Roberto Bianco of USA Today wrote a similarly negative review, suggesting that the easiest fix for its problem was [...] "cancellation". John McWhorter of The New Republic called it [...] "a patronizing mess" [...] and [...] "basically Family Guy in blackface". He added: [...] "What isn't black in it is so shamelessly ripped off from Family Guy that it's hard to believe it's the product of creators who are usually so studiously 'post-' obvious stunts of the sort." [...] Matt Rouse of TV Guide wrote, [...] "The lamest, most unnecessary spin-off since Private Practice, Cleveland rests {{on the shoulders of}} the hopelessly bland title character". However, Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was more positive about the program, writing that although The Cleveland Show was [...] "just as rude-crude" [...] as Family Guy, it also had [...] "more warmth" [...] due to Cleveland being a more likeable character than Peter Griffin. Owen also praised the character of Tim the Bear, stating that [...] "Tim {{is by far the most}} amusing creation." ...|$|R
