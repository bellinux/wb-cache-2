5|$|The Roman Empire {{was one of}} {{the largest}} in history, with {{contiguous}} territories throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. The Latin phrase imperium sine fine ("empire without end") expressed the <b>ideology</b> <b>that</b> neither time nor space limited the Empire. In Vergil's epic poem the Aeneid, limitless empire is said to be granted to the Romans by their supreme deity Jupiter. This claim of universal dominion was renewed and perpetuated when the Empire came under Christian rule in the 4th century.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the history}} of Nazism's rise to power in Germany in the 1930s, the present German state has {{committed}} itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any <b>ideology</b> <b>that</b> threatens the values enshrined in the German constitution. The BfV domestic intelligence service (Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution) regards the aims of Scientology as running counter to Germany's free and democratic order, and has been monitoring Scientology since 1997, as have the Offices for the Protection of the Constitution {{in a number of}} German Länder. Minister for Family Policy Claudia Nolte instituted the surveillance, saying that the church had totalitarian tendencies and that she would oppose Scientology with all the means at her disposal.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} source of language change is contact and resulting diffusion of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers {{of two or more}} languages or varieties interact on a regular basis. Multilingualism is likely to have been the norm throughout human history and most people in the modern world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the ethno-national state, monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the <b>ideology</b> <b>that</b> made one people, one state, and one language the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.|$|E

50|$|Governmental {{policies}} often {{reflect the}} tension between two contrasting types of language ideologies: <b>ideologies</b> <b>that</b> conceive of language as a resource, problem, or right and <b>ideologies</b> <b>that</b> conceive of language as pluralistic phenomena. The language-related policies that emerge in such instances often reflect the compromise that is reached between {{these two types of}} ideologies. According to Blommaert and Verschueren, this compromise is often reinterpreted as a single, unified ideology, evidenced by the many European societies characterized by a language ideological homogenism.|$|R
25|$|The party's {{foreign policy}} has also been widely {{described}} as Neo-Ottomanist, an <b>ideology</b> <b>that</b> promotes renewed Turkish political engagement in the former territories of its predecessor state, the Ottoman Empire.

25|$|The two-nation is the <b>ideology</b> <b>that</b> {{the primary}} {{identity}} and unifying denominator of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent is their religion, {{rather than their}} language or ethnicity, and therefore Indian Hindus and Muslims are two distinct nations, regardless of ethnic or other commonalities. The two-nation theory was a founding principle of the Pakistan Movement (i.e. the ideology of Pakistan as a Muslim nation-state in South Asia), and the partition of India in 1947.|$|E

25|$|Early theorists such {{as these}} saw no agency {{whatsoever}} for audiences of the culture industry, claiming instead that this industry was founded on mass deception and that the average consumer was a cultural dupe being inculcated into {{the values of the}} ruling classes without realizing it.
