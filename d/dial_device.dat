40|$|BACKGROUND: Spiromax® {{is a novel}} dry-powder inhaler {{containing}} {{formulations of}} budesonide plus formoterol (BF). The device is intended to provide dose equivalence with enhanced user-friendliness compared to BF Turbuhaler® in asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). The present study was performed to compare inhalation parameters with empty versions of the two devices, and to investigate the effects of enhanced training designed to encourage faster inhalation. METHODS: This randomised, open-label, cross-over study included children with asthma (n[*]=[*] 23), adolescents with asthma (n[*]=[*] 27), adults with asthma (n[*]=[*] 50), adults with COPD (n[*]=[*] 50) and healthy adult volunteers (n[*]=[*] 50). Inhalation manoeuvres were recorded with each device after training with the patient information leaflet (PIL) and after enhanced training using an In-Check <b>Dial</b> <b>device.</b> RESULTS: After PIL training, peak inspiratory flow (PIF), maximum change in pressure (∆P) and the inhalation volume (IV) were significantly higher with Spiromax than with the Turbuhaler device (p values were at least < 0. 05 in all patient groups). After enhanced training, numerically or significantly higher values for PIF, ∆P, IV and acceleration remained with Spiromax versus Turbuhaler, except for ∆P in COPD patients. After PIL training, one adult asthma patient and one COPD patient inhaled < 30 L/min through the Spiromax compared to one adult asthma patient and five COPD patients with the Turbuhaler. All patients achieved PIF values of at least 30 L/min after enhanced training. CONCLUSIONS: The two inhalers have similar resistance so inhalation flows and pressure changes would be expected to be similar. The higher flow-related values noted for Spiromax versus Turbuhaler after PIL training suggest that Spiromax might have human factor advantages in real-world use. After enhanced training, the flow-related differences between devices persisted; increased flow rates were achieved with both devices, and all patients achieved the minimal flow required for adequate drug delivery. Enhanced training could be useful, especially in COPD patients...|$|E

Dry powder inhaler (DPI) requires optimal peak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR) for drug delivery. Low PIFR generation is common in the elderly. Patient lung function and intrinsic inhaler resistance are factors for determining generated PIFR and drug delivery from DPI. Objectives: We aimed to identify the PIFR of the older (aged > 60  years) and the younger (aged ≤ 60  years) patients with obstructive airway diseases for the different inhaler devices (Turbuhaler® and Accuhaler). Patients and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to December 2014. Patients with obstructive airway diseases were recruited. Spirometry was performed. PIFR was measured by using an In-Check <b>DIAL</b> <b>device.</b> Individual PIFR values for each inhaler device were obtained for three consecutive measurements and then averaged. Results: A total of 139 patients diagnosed with obstructive lung diseases (asthma, n = 109; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, n = 30) were recruited. Of these, 71 patients (51 %) were > 60  years. The PIFR generated by the patients who were ≤ 60  years for nonresistance mode was not different from that generated by those aged > 60  years (115. 0 ± 15. 2  L/min vs 115. 4  ±   13. 3  L/ min, p = 0. 86). Regarding the DPI, PIFR generated from the older group was significantly lower than that generated from the younger group for Turbuhaler (72. 5 ± 18. 8  L/min vs 82. 4 ± 21. 1  L/min, p = 0. 01), but the PIFR generated was not significantly different between the older and the younger groups for the Accuhaler (93. 8 ± 22. 9  L/min vs 99. 4 ± 24. 2  L/min, p = 0. 86). The low {{peak expiratory flow rate}} and PIFR from spirometry were associated with the suboptimal PIFR measured by using In-Check DIAL. Discussion: Optimal PIFR is critical for DPI use in the elderly; appropriate DPI selection is essential for management. In-Check DIAL may be useful for detecting inhaler device problem among the elderly. Conclusion: Lower PIFR generated from Turbuhaler was noted in patients with airway diseases who were older than 60  years, when compared to the younger patients.

40|$|Currently {{available}} {{dry powder}} inhalers (DPIs) for drug delivery to the lungs require turbulent energy to generate and disperse aerosol {{particles in the}} respirable range ≤ 5 μm during inhalation. The patient's inspiratory effort together with the resistance inside the device creates this energy. Different inhalers provide varying degrees of resistance to inhalation flow and require different inhalation techniques for the generation and delivery of drug fine particles in respirable size range to the lungs. The aim of this research programme was to identify the influence of inhalation flow, inhalation volume {{and the number of}} inhalations per dose on the ex-vivo dose emission and the in-vitro aerodynamic dose emission characteristics of the salbutamol Accuhaler®, Easyhaler®, and Clickhaler® and the terbutaline Turbuhaler® DPIs. A high-performance liquid chromatography method for the assay of salbutamol sulphate and terbutaline sulphate in aqueous samples was modified and accordingly validated. In-vitro dose emission of the four different DPIs was measured using the pharmacopoeia method with modifications to simulate varying inhalation flows within patient and between patients. The ranges of the total emitted dose (% nominal dose) at the inhalation flow range of 10 - 60 Lmin- 1, following one and two inhalations per metered dose for 2 L and 4 L inhaled volumes were as follows: the Accuhaler (52. 64 - 85. 11; 61. 88 - 85. 11 and 59. 23 - 85. 11; 62. 81 - 85. 11); the Easyhaler (68. 35 - 91. 99; 79. 94 - 91. 99 and 73. 83 - 92. 51; 80. 40 - 92. 51); the Clickhaler (46. 55 - 96. 49; 51. 12 - 96. 49 and 51. 18 - 101. 39; 59. 71 - 101. 39) as well as the Turbuhaler (46. 08 - 88. 13; 51. 95 - 88. 13 and 48. 05 - 89. 22; 48. 64 - 89. 22). The results highlight that the four inhalers have flow-dependent dose emission property to a varying degree using 2 L and 4 L inhaled volumes. There {{was no significant difference in}} the total emitted dose between a 2 L inhaled volume and a 4 L inhaled volume at each inhalation flow. Furthermore, the total emitted dose from the Easyhaler®, Clickhaler®, and Turbuhaler® was significantly (p≤ 0. 001) greater with two inhalations than one inhalation per metered dose across the range of inhalation flow (10 - 60) Lmin- 1. This effect was only observed at inhalation flow less than 30 Lmin- 1 with the Accuhaler®. Overall there is a significant difference in the total emitted dose. The ex-vivo dose emission of the four different DPIs has been determined using the In- Check <b>Dial</b> <b>device</b> to train twelve non-smoking healthy adult volunteers to inhale at slow (30 Lmin- 1) and fast (60 L min- 1) inhalation flows through the device with its dial set corresponding to each inhaler. Subsequently each volunteer inhaled at the trained inhalation flows through each active inhaler. The local ethics committee approval was obtained prior to the study and all volunteers gave signed informed consent. The results obtained demonstrate that the studied inhalers have flow-dependent dose emission, thereby enhancing confidence in the use of the In-Check Dial® to identify a patient's inhalation flows through a variety of DPIs. Also the total emitted dose determined by ex-vivo methodology was significantly (p≤ 0. 05) greater with two inhalations than one inhalation per metered dose. The results of the in-vitro aerodynamic dose emission characteristics highlight that the fine particle dose (FPD) from the four studied inhalers is flow dependent. Also the minimum inhalation flow to generate the (FPD) with the appropriate characteristics for lung deposition has been identified to be 20 L min⁻¹ for the Accuhaler®, Easyhaler® and Clickhaler®, while that for the Turbuhaler® is about 30 L min⁻¹. Also the inhalation volume above 2 L and the number of inhalations for each dose have respectively no significant (p≤ 0. 05) influence on the FPD emitted from the four studied inhalers. The results support the present instructions to patients using these inhalers to inhale once for each dose as fast as they can. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Since then, advances have been made in methods for purging out-of-scope numbers from RDD samples. Sample purging results from the National Immunization Survey will be presented for 78 geographic areas covering the entire U. S. These sample-purging techniques set aside residential directory-listed telephone numbers on the assumption that the majority are residential numbers. The latest sample purging methods also process residential directory-listed numbers, resulting in some of these numbers being classified as out-of-scope.

Another aspect of sample purging, which is of growing importance in RDD samples, is cellular telephone numbers. FCC regulations specify that cell numbers not be dialed using automated <b>dialing</b> <b>devices.</b> Cellular telephone numbers fall into three categories: 1) numbers in dedicated cellular telephone exchanges, 2) cell numbers in mixed-use exchanges, and 3) cell numbers in POTS exchanges that have been ported from land-line numbers.

5000|$|Wormholes {{are also}} the {{principal}} means of space travel in the Stargate movie and the spin-off television series, Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis and Stargate Universe. The central plot device of the programs is an ancient transportation network consisting of the ring-shaped devices known as Stargates, which generate artificial wormholes that allow one-way matter transmission and two-way radio communication between gates when the correct spatial coordinates are [...] "dialed". However, for some reason not yet explained, the water-like event horizon breaks down the matter and converts it into energy for transport through the wormhole, restoring it into its original state at the destination. This would explain why electromagnetic energy can travel both ways — it doesn't have to be converted. The one-way rule {{may be caused by}} the Stargates themselves: as a Gate may only be capable of creating an event-horizon that either breaks down or reconstitutes matter, but not both. It does serve as a very useful plot device: When one wants to return to the other end one must close the original wormhole and [...] "redial", which means one needs access to the <b>dialing</b> <b>device.</b> The one-way nature of the Stargates helps to defend the gate from unwanted incursions. Also, Stargates can sustain an artificial wormhole for only 38 minutes. It's possible to keep it active for a longer period, but it would take immense amounts of energy. The wormholes generated by the Stargates are based on the misconception that wormholes in 3D space have 2D (circular) event horizons, but a proper visualization of a wormhole in 3D space would be a spherical event horizon.|$|R

Analysis of deflection and resistance of the measuring probe was then plotted as a linear equation (y = kx +b). The deformed muscle tissue was conceptually modelled and represented using 3 subsequent springs in series, representing 3 different compartments (layers) of skeletal muscle. Indices of total compressive stiffness of skeletal muscle and specific power of resistance during tissue compression were calculated using multiple mathematical formulas. A comparative statistical analysis between pre-intervention and post-intervention data was performed with the single tailed paired samples t-test from the software program SPSS 12. 0. 1 for Windows. 	 	There {{was no significant difference}} in stiffness (95 % CI = - 0. 06419 to 0. 23786 degrees; t = 1. 233; df = 14; P < 0. 238) and power of resistance (95 % CI = - 0. 00804 to 0. 01988 degrees; t = - 0. 910; df = 14; P < 0. 378) between pre-intervention and post-intervention states. After intervention the stiffness and power of resistance of the biceps brachii muscle did not decrease. The Cohen’s d post-hoc test showed that the effect size of the intervention was considered to be small, low, minor. No significant individual difference was demonstrated in terms of the stiffness (95 % CI = - 0. 36715 to 0. 07369 degrees; t = - 1. 428; df = 14; P < 0. 175) and power of resistance (95 % CI = - 0. 02503 to 0. 01245 degrees; t = - 0. 719; df = 14; P < 0. 484) between pre-intervention (baseline) trials for each subject. 	This study demonstrates that muscle energy technique did not decrease indices of viscoelasticity (stiffness and power of resistance) of the biceps brachii muscle. These findings encourage further research on the physiological background of MET...|$|R
