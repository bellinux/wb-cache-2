40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The {{vertical}} reference system being considered utilizes a two-degree-of-freedom gyroscope configured as a vertical gyro. Each gimbal erection circuit forms a second-order feedback control system. Gyros are susceptable {{to a number}} of error sources. In view of the closed loop application being considered, all error sources are of negligible consequence with the exception of friction. With friction included in the gyro model, the <b>inner</b> and outer <b>gimbal</b> erection circuits cease to exist as independent second-order systems. Friction couples the gimbal erection circuits together in a type of algebraic loop. Bearing friction is a random phenomenon best described by a Gaussian distribution. Slip-ring friction is best categorized as a sliding friction. For simulation purposes, slip-ring friction is conveniently handled using the Amontons-Coulomb description. The digital technique is better suited to this simulation problem primarily because of the many decision making elements required. The Gaussian distribution needed to produce the random bearing torques is generated by sampling from the more easily produced uniform distribution. The simulation program is written in the FORTRAN IV programming language. Because of the special features required in simulating the {{vertical reference}} system, it was more feasible to develop the simulation program as a self-contained package complete with an integration routine. A second-order Runge-Kutta integration routine was selected. Using an integration interval of 0. 02 seconds, the simulation program produces excellent results when compared with the response characteristic of an actual vertical reference system...|$|R

The pendulums were used to set the X axis exactly vertical, and the prisms were used to align the Y and Z axes, just before launch. The prisms reflected infrared beams sent into the ST-124 by a theodolite stationed 700 feet away from the launch pad. Commands from the theodolite were transmitted via cables to the vehicle, to torquers in the ST-124 to orient the stable platform toward the correct azimuth.|$|E

The <b>inner</b> <b>gimbal</b> of Foucault gyroscope was balanced on knife edge bearings {{on the outer}} gimbal and the outer gimbal was suspended by a fine, torsion-free thread {{in such a manner}} that the lower pivot point carried almost no weight. The gyro was spun to 9000-12000 revolutions per minute with an arrangement of gears before being placed into position, which was sufficient time to balance the gyroscope and carry out 10 minutes of experimentation. The instrument could be observed either with a microscope viewing a tenth of a degree scale or by a long pointer. At least three more copies of a Foucault gyro were made in convenient travelling and demonstration boxes and copies survive in the UK, France, and the USA.|$|E

The equations for the generation of torque of an inertially fixed CMG are presented. To realize a particular commanded torque, the gimbal rates of the CMG must be specified. These gimbal rates are shown to be functions of gimbal angle orientation and the commanded torque.
