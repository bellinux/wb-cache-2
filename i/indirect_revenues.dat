40|$|Bribes by {{firms in}} Indonesia arise principally from {{regulations}} [...] licenses and levies [...] imposed by local government officials. Regulations generate direct revenues (fees) plus <b>indirect</b> <b>revenues</b> {{in the form}} of bribes. The expected value of the latter is capitalized into lower salaries needed by localities to compensate public officials. Localities in Indonesia are hampered by insufficient revenues from formal tax and transfer sources to pay competitive salaries plus fund demanded' levels of public services, because local tax rates are capped by the center and inter-governmental transfers are limited. Thus the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>revenues</b> from local regulations are critical to local finances. The paper models and estimates the key aspects of corruption [...] the relationship between bribes, time spent with local officials, and different forms of regulation. It models how inter-jurisdictional competition for firms limits the extent of local regulation and how greater sources of tax or inter-governmental revenues reduce the need for regulation and corruption. The paper estimates a large reduction in regulation in better funded localities. The findings are directly relevant to Indonesia where corruption is high and the country is in the throes of major decentralization and local democratization efforts. ...|$|E

Based on official data for 2008 - 2012, I processed and interpreted the data, reaching conclusions on taxation in our country and in Europe. Thus I concluded that Romania has a low rate on incomes, profit or dividend tax. At European level the progressive taxation is used by most states, to the detriment of the flat one. The taxes and fees quotas vary from state to state, but are subject to Community and national legal regulations. In terms of revenue structure, Romania follows the European trend in that <b>indirect</b> <b>revenues</b> is the primarily budgetary resource. ...|$|E

However, although the potential for marine wildlife tourism is huge it is considerably under-developed. Ireland has a lot of similarities in terms of species diversity and environmental conditions with Scotland. A number of studies have quantified the volume and value of wildlife tourism in Scotland and identified key areas for development. The Scottish Tourism and Environment Initiative co-funded with the Scottish Natural Heritage a study to assess the economic value of marine wildlife tourism in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland (Anon, 1998). This study estimated that total revenues generated by marine wildlife tourism in 1996 was in the order of £ 57 million and supported 2, 670 FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) jobs.

In order to answer this a literature review have been done and a case study of, and visit to, a 236 kWp PV system in Piteå, Sweden have been conducted. Simulations of this system have been done for average years, through extracted system data, and meteorological data, in order to compare to the actual performance of the system. The levelized cost of energy from the PV system have been calculated through a constructed tool. And the investment profitability in Norway have been investigated. It {{was found that the}} quality of irradiation databases available for northern latitude is low. The best generic database found was the NASA/SSE. The low irradiation conditions in northern latitudes might {{have a negative effect on}} inverter performance. The optimal module tilt and azimuth should be based on snow accumulation in addition to solar geometry and irradiation composition The simulation of the 236 kWp PV system gave a performance ratio of 0. 850, specific production of 897 kWh/kWp, and an annual yield of 208 kWh. Although comparison between simulation based on actual weather conditions and reported delivered energy from the system suggests an inverter efficiency of 89. 1 % instead of 96. 3 % as suggested by the manufacturer. The PV system LCOE was calculated to be 0. 132 EUR/kWh. The cost level was found to be close to world best practice. A scenario with a 15 kWp PV system for a private household in Norway gave a cost of energy from a PV system of 0. 12 EUR/kWh, 0. 02 EUR/kWh above the socket electricity price. <b>Indirect</b> <b>revenues</b> points to a higher value of PV electricity, making this the preferred choice.

40|$|The path {{of growth}} and {{development}} for many American colleges and universities is to add new programs, majors, minors, departments, institutes, and centers to their academic portfolios {{in order to meet}} new demands and pursue new knowledge. Their source of funding is primarily through raising tuition rates and increasing non-tuition financial resources, including fundraising campaigns, endowments, and auxiliary services. The option rarely taken is scaling back or even eliminating old academic programs to make room for new ones. Historically, there has been little incentive to reduce academic programs. Student demand for higher education has been virtually insatiable and institutional capacity for implementing high tuition rate increases has been virtually unlimited. However, as a result of increasing economic pressures in recent years, the American higher education business model has been severely challenged and will likely need to be modified to ensure the stabilization of its financial underpinnings going forward. The specific issue that is examined in this study is the decision-making process that colleges and universities use in determining which academic programs to eliminate, consolidate, or reorganize. A particular focus of the research is the role that Responsibility Center Management (RCM) plays in the program closure and reorganization decision-making process and how institutions that use RCM differ from those that do not. RCM is a financial management model which allocates all direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>revenues</b> as well as direct and indirect expenses to individual academic units. The model identifies which programs are generating surpluses, deficits, or break-even results, and how they all look in combination with one another in forming the overall cross-subsidy profile of the institution. The research for this study includes a qualitative comparison case study analysis using three cases, all of which are private universities that have decided to discontinue or reorganize academic programs—one that uses RCM, one that does not use RCM, and one that uses a hybrid combination of RCM and non- RCM.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 - 12 This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} evolution {{and role of}} land as a fiscal asset in China since the onset of reforms in 1978. Research presented in this dissertation specifically examines: 1) the role of land markets and land use rights in China's local political economy and local bureaucrat fiscal behavior; 2) the evolution and development of land finance as local government strategy for maximizing revenues {{in the absence of}} other sources; and 3) the extent to which neoliberalism explains growth and change in the value and transacting of land use rights in the Chinese context. Findings from this analysis show that the local government behaves in ways consistent with revenue maximization. Land, as an available, immobile asset made available for expropriation through an ambiguous legal and institutional framework, is a coveted asset of local bureaucrats and exploited to support local fiscal revenue needs. Land markets, or the monetized transfer of use rights, are organized in ways that allow the local state to capture economic surplus. Land markets thus represent the state's leveraging of market mechanisms to achieve state aims of revenue and economic capture, rather than a local state embrace of a market logic to governance and resource allocation. Exogenous changes in China's political economy and central-local relations with respect to land have catalyzed new forms of land finance, ranging from the collateralizing and leveraging of land assets to expanding the local state's <b>indirect</b> <b>revenues</b> into bank loans and bond capital purposed for local state infrastructure investments, to elaborate debt restructuring schemes as is in the case of Yufu Capital Management Corporation in Chongqing. The findings from this research expand our understanding of land finance and the legacy effects of past institutions on current period political economy and state behavior. While economic geography has focused much attention on the behavior of firms, the case of China broadens this field of research into the behavior and incentives of the local state in the fostering and operation of markets. Moreover, evidence presents challenges to neoliberalism as the primary paradigm through which to understand and interpret China's economic growth and class divisions over the reform era. Contrary to the narrative of the state retreating and embracing the market, Chinese local government bureaucrats have leveraged market mechanisms to expand and strengthen the local state...|$|E
40|$|The {{distance}} between marinas along the Dutch coast is large. By building marinas on strategic locations along the coast, sailing times {{can be reduced}} significantly. However, building marinas bordering the North Sea is expensive {{due to the lack}} of sheltering from waves. Hook of Holland is such a strategic location, located at a distance of 30 kilometers of Stellendam and 20 kilometers away from Scheveningen. The realization of a marina at Hook of Holland will lead to season lengthening, differentiation of the beach function and creates a boost for the local economy. In addition, it will be a stepping stone for creation of a network of marinas along the Dutch coast which will enable day trips from marina to marina, boosting the economy further. Waves in the marina basin will lead to damage to the yachts if the significant wave height Hs is higher than Hs = 0. 6 m. The design storm for the marina has a return period of 200 years and will lead to waves with a significant wave height up to Hs = 4. 3 m at the project area. Also it will lead to a water level rise up to 4. 2 m above NAP. To reduce the waves in the basin, a large breakwater is needed which is expensive. An entrance of the marina along the Nieuwe Waterweg is cheaper but politically unachievable. A previous study for a marina with the entrance along the Nieuwe Waterweg did not make it to realization due to this factor. A marina is mostly financed with real estate development and funding of the government. Real estate development at the project area is difficult to realize due to the nearby Natura 2000 area ‘Solleveld & Kapittel duinen’ and its associated strict nature legislation. Land reclamation is a possibility to make real estate development possible. However at the moment this is not attractive due to the prices for land reclamation are higher than inland development of these functions. Also the real estate market is in a downward state due to the economic crisis. A marina at Hook of Holland needs to be on a small scale and well integrated in the surroundings without a large land reclamation project, such a marina will cost around 50 million euro. A marina at Hook of Holland is technically feasible and has a positive effect on the required coastal maintenance. However the direct revenues are much lower than the construction costs.

40|$|Proponents of {{transfer}} taxation argue that levies on gifts and estates serve the dual purposes of breaking up large concentrations of private wealth, while raising significant revenues.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{addresses}} the impending revenue losses from {{the inability of}} state and local governments to collect sales and use taxes on internet transactions. Our focus is on both the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>revenue</b> losses to local governments. We consider the effects of e-commerce in the context of pre-existing trends in sales and use taxation, and also highlight the importance of business-to-business e-commerce. Combining the direct effects of reduced local option sales tax collections with the indirect effects of reductions in state revenue sharing and state grants to local governments, we estimate that local governments will lose approximately $ 4. 3 billion as a result of e-commerce in 2003. This represents about 40 percent of the combined state and local loss of $ 10. 8 billion. 1 Introduction The attention that commentators and analysts have paid to the fiscal, ec nomic and productivity effects associated with the orld wide web and the internet is unparalleled, though many different perceptions have surfaced.

By using the 0.44 revenue ratio, I am {{assuming}} that the non-VAT indirect taxes {{do not have the}} small-seller exemption (or other compliance and enforcement features that create marginal costs without obtaining revenue). Because the revenue ratio is VAT revenue divided by total consumption, 0.066 is effectively <b>indirect</b> tax <b>revenue</b> divided by total consumption.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a number of}} European {{countries}} have shifted their tax structure more strongly towards indirect taxes, motivated, inter alia, by the intention to foster competitiveness. Against this background, this paper develops a tractable two-country model of a monetary union, characterised by national fiscal and supranational monetary policy, with price-setting firms and endogenously determined terms of trade. The paper discusses a number of monetary and fiscal policy questions which emerge {{if one of the}} countries shifts its tax structure more strongly towards indirect taxes. Qualitatively, it is shown that the long-run effects of such a unilateral policy shift on output and consumption within and between the two countries depend sensitively on whether <b>indirect</b> tax <b>revenues</b> are used to lower direct taxes or to finance additional government expenditures. Moreover, short-run dynamics are shown to depend significantly on the speed at which fiscal adjustments take place, on the choice of the inflation index stabilised by the central bank, and on whether the tax shift is anticipated or not. Quantitatively, the calibrated model version indicates that only if the additional <b>indirect</b> tax <b>revenues</b> are used to finance a cut in direct taxes there is some, though limited scope for non-negligible spillovers between countries.

30|$|The {{public sector}} is {{represented}} by the federal government and a consolidated provincial and local government. Both governments collect direct tax revenues from households and firms and <b>indirect</b> tax <b>revenues</b> on domestic and traded goods and services. Public expenditures are allocated between the consumption of goods and services and transfers. In each period the former component of public expenditures is adjusted to respect a long-run closure rule consisting in fixed ratios of public saving to GDP. In addition, we assume that foreign savings are also fixed in proportion of GDP 10.|$|R
