An NGT was used to establish group consensus on the following question: <b>In</b> <b>your</b> <b>opinion,</b> <b>what</b> research {{needs to be done to}} better understand the effectiveness, usability and design of mobile health apps and devices for older adults? Results: Overall, the collaborative approach was a very successful strategy to bring together a diverse group of participants with the same end goal. The 32 participants generated 119 items in total. The top three research questions that emerged from the NGT were related to adoption, the need for high quality tools and the digital divide. Strong sub-themes included privacy and security, engagement and design. The NGT also helped us include the perspectives information from non-academic researchers that would not have been captured if the process had been limited to the research team. Conclusions: Developing ways for patients and other stakeholders to have a voice when it comes to developing patient awareness as related to mHealth may guide future research into engagement, ownership, usability and design. It is our intention that our paper be used and adapted by other researchers to engage small or vulnerable populations often excluded from mHealth research and design. None Declare...|$|E

40|$|La dépression majeure est l’une des premières causes d’incapacité au travail dans {{le monde}} et a de nombreuses conséquences tant sur l’employé concerné qu’auprès des acteurs du milieu de travail. Objectif Nous visons à documenter, selon la {{perspective}} des employeurs et des cadres des ressources humaines, les stratégies que ces acteurs préconisent dans leur organisation pour faciliter le retour au travail (RaT) d’employés en absence maladie due à une dépression. Méthode Deux cent dix-neuf employeurs et cadres de ressources humaines (n =  219) ont accepté de répondre à une entrevue semi-structurée téléphonique. La question abordée dans cet article était : « Selon vous, quelles sont les stratégies les plus efficaces pour aider un employé ayant reçu un diagnostic de dépression à retourner au travail ? » La codification du verbatim a été effectuée à partir d’études empiriques et de théories existantes. Résultats Trente-quatre (34) stratégies réparties sur six grands principes ont émergé : 1) Contact avec l’employé en absence maladie (10 stratégies)  ; 2) Évaluation et planification du RaT sans précipitation (6)  ; 3) Formation des gestionnaires et du collectif de travail à la problématique de la santé mentale au travail (4)  ; 4)  Concertation des acteurs clés du RaT (4)  ; 5) RaT progressif avec aménagements (4)  ; 6) Suivi de la santé de l’employé et de son travail (6). Conclusion Ces principes articulés autour de 34 stratégies du RaT vont au-delà d’un processus étapiste de nature chronologique. Articulés dans un programme de RaT, ils devront être testés afin d’évaluer leurs retombées dans les organisations, notamment sur la gestion de l’incapacité au travail. Major depression {{is one of}} the leading causes of work disability across the world. In Canada, the lifetime prevalence of depression varies from 10 to 12 %. Depression impacts not only the employee who is often stigmatized and can lose his professional identity, but also has consequences on colleagues and supervisors in organizations. In the literature, four models are described from which employers and managers use in their organizations to make decisions regarding the work disability of employees on sick leave: biomedical, financial management, personnel management, and organizational development. These models can also be supported by economic, legal and ethical interests. Even though these models are essential to better understand the decision of employers and HR regarding work disability, information remains scarce regarding the concrete strategies used by these stakeholders to facilitate the return to work for employees on sick leave due to depression. Objectives the aim of this paper is to document, considering employers’ and human resources’ perspectives, the best strategies to put in place to facilitate the return to work of employees on sick leave due to depression. Method This study was part of a larger study carried out in Canada to assess factors influencing the return to work after a depression-related sick leave, taking into account the viewpoint of four types of stakeholders: employers/human resources, supervisors, unions and people diagnosed with depression. 219 employers (68. 5 %) and human resources directors (31. 5 %) from 82. 6 % organizations having more than 100 employees accepted to answer a telephone semi-structured interview. The question of interest in this study is: <b>In</b> <b>your</b> <b>opinion,</b> <b>what</b> are the best strategies to help an employee who has had a depression to return to work? Coding was influenced by empirical findings and theories related to psychosocial risk factors that the authors use in their respective disciplines as well as return to work principles/steps mentioned in the literature. The main objective was to keep all the strategies mentioned by participants, and analyzing them with major principles of return to work. Results  24 return to work strategies spread on six principles emerged: 1) Contact with the employee during his sick leave (10 strategies); 2) Evaluate and plan the return to work without precipitating it (6); 3) Training for managers and colleagues regarding mental health in the workplace (4); 4) Concertation between key return to work stakeholders (4); 5) Progressive return to work with work accommodations (4); 6) Health and work follow-up regarding the employee (6). Conclusion These six principles including 34 strategies are usually related to the timeframe process of the return to work, though they can be implemented sometimes in parallel. This possible overlap reinforces the idea to consider the return to work as sustainable in order to prevent potential relapses and improve the performance at work. Next steps will be to systematically implement these principles and strategies in organizations in order to evaluate their impact on return to work of employees on sick leave due to depression...|$|E
40|$|Short or {{long term}} gains? CUE: The {{marketing}} of fruit from indigenous trees {{is becoming increasingly}} popular in many African countries. As a result, rural communities are finding {{a new way of}} earning income from their forest resources. However, if the exploitation of these fruit is done carelessly, trees can be damaged and the resource lost. One cause of careless exploitation is uncertainty over ownership; if the trees do not belong to anyone, nobody is responsible for ensuring that they are harvested responsibly. The World Agroforestry Centre, also known as ICRAF, is working in Zimbabwe to support sustainable use of indigenous fruit trees. In our next report, Livai Matarirano, an agroforestry development facilitator, explains to Sylvia Jiyane how some communities in Zimbabwe have established a system of ownership for wild fruit trees, and how ICRAF is helping them to earn more money from their fruit marketing. He also warns of the dangers of over-exploitation and suggests an alternative way for farmers to boost their fruit harvests without damaging the natural forests. Sylvia began by asking to what extent rural communities were already practising sustainable management of their forest resources. IN:		?There are cases whereby ? OUT:		? the demand on the forest. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 21 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Livai Matarirano, pointing out how growing indigenous trees on farm can reduce the pressure on natural forests. Transcript Matarirano	There are cases whereby communities are managing their resources in a sustainable way, but in the majority of cases this is not the case. There is a lot of deforestation, a lot of desertification that is coming on, {{as a result of the}} removal of trees. But just to highlight examples of where sustainable management of forest resources is, one is where communities have seen the economic benefit of exploiting a natural resource. I?m talking here about indigenous fruit trees, which has developed into tree tenure. People know that they can harvest fruit from it and sell it and get some money, and what is happening is now they are cultivating around the trees and one that is cultivated, it means that somebody owns it. Now by caring for the tree, and also that there is individual ownership, you will find that the harvest and productivity of that tree is extended for quite a long time, and that leads to sustainable utilisation of resources. Jiyane	Do you sometimes carry out some activities together or joint projects, with the community? Matarirano	We have quite a number of activities that we do with communities. One is on value-adding of indigenous fruits, where we have been looking at ways of marketing these indigenous fruits rather than just sending them to the market raw. Is there anything that you can do to improve on the quality or the way that you present it to the market? One of the ways that has been developed is to make them into flour, grind them and make them into flour, and that flour can be made into porridge, can be added to milk to make yoghurt, or it can be just added to water, and you have a drink, maybe fresh or you can have it frozen and so forth. And by providing that variety, the market is acceptable, and then you have income coming in, so that?s one direct benefit. Jiyane	<b>In</b> <b>your</b> <b>opinion,</b> <b>what</b> have been some of the main threats to sustainable use of forest resources? Matarirano	The main threat is immediate gains. People want money but forest resources don?t grow as fast to match that demand, so many a time when a benefit, an economic benefit has been realised by the farmers, they will go and exploit forest resources such that they are depleted, and there is a lot of deforestation. For example, there is this plant called Sclerocarya birrea, which people brew into ?marula?. In South Africa they produce a wine, marula wine. Now if there is a market that is readily available for it, people will just go into the forest, harvest, and bring it to the market. Yet when you look at what happens in the forest, because the demand is so high, the care is not there, such that the produce will get less, and less, and less. But we say that if people can be taught about the use of these things, how they can be grafted or planted, so that you reduce the period from planting to production, then it means more trees can be produced and maybe that will also reduce the demand on the forest. End of track. An agroforester from Zimbabwe describes how a system of ?tree tenure? encourages sustainable harvesting of indigenous fruit trees, explains ways of adding value to the fruit, and how domestication of indigenous fruit trees can take the pressure off natural forests...|$|E
