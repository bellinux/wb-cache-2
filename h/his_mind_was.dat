5|$|Clolarion was {{a legendary}} protoss executor, whose deeds {{were taught to}} Templar warriors long after his death. Because of his status, Clolarion was chosen {{to take part in}} the {{purifier}} program. <b>His</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> scanned into a robotic shell, in an attempt to recreate and preserve the greatest warriors of the Templar. The Clolarion purifier was sealed in Cybros along with the rest of the purifiers after their rebellion against the Conclave.|$|E

25|$|He {{asked himself}} why was {{there such a}} drastic {{discrepancy}} between the Buddhist doctrines that he read about in books and {{the actual practice of}} Buddhism in real life. He yearned to dedicate his whole life to unraveling this mystery. <b>His</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> set on finding places where Buddhism was still practiced the way it should be. It was at this point where he decided to become a monastic.|$|E

25|$|Dollond {{was aware}} of the {{conditions}} necessary for the attainment of achromatism in refracting telescopes, but relied on the accuracy of experiments made by Newton. His writings show that with the exception of his bravado, he would have arrived sooner at a discovery for which <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> fully prepared. Dollond's paper recounts the successive steps by which he arrived at his discovery independently of Hall's earlier invention—and the logical processes by which these steps were suggested to his mind.|$|E
25|$|The bent of <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> decidedly political. He was {{a natural}} born politician. Politics was his meat and drink, and nothing so delighted him as the {{opportunity}} to engage in political discussion {{in which he was}} apt to engross most of the time. On the stump he was a formidable antagonist and his experiences in this respect has probably never been equaled in Perry County. His knowledge of the roads, streams and by paths, the ravings and hollows, the school houses and places of public resort in Perry county was surpassed by no one.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{physical}} injuries, Hughes was proud that <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> still working. As {{he lay in}} his hospital bed, {{he decided that he}} did not like the bed's design. He called in plant engineers to design a customized bed, equipped with hot and cold running water, built in six sections, and operated by 30 electric motors, with push-button adjustments. The hospital bed was designed by Hughes specifically to alleviate the pain caused by moving with severe burn injuries. Despite the fact that he never had the chance to use the bed that he designed, Hughes' bed served as a prototype for the modern hospital bed. Hughes' doctors considered his recovery almost miraculous. Hughes, however, believed that neither miracle nor modern medicine contributed to his recovery, instead asserting the natural life-giving properties of fresh-squeezed orange juice were responsible.|$|E

25|$|Hawkins {{had told}} me aboard the ship that he would put his platoon of men up against any company of {{soldiers}} on earth and guarantee to win. He was slightly wounded by shrapnel as he came ashore in the first wave, but {{the furthest thing from}} <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> to be evacuated. He led his platoon into the forest of coconut palms. During {{a day and a half}} he personally cleaned out six Jap machine gun nests, sometimes standing on top of a track and firing point blank at four or five men who fired back at him from behind blockhouses. Lieutenant Hawkins was wounded a second time, but he still refused to retire. To say that his conduct was worthy of the highest traditions of the Marine Corps is like saying the Empire State Building is moderately high.|$|E
25|$|Boston in {{the early}} nineteenth century was a hotbed of {{political}} foment. Howe’s father was a Democrat who considered Harvard University a den of Federalists, and refused to allow his sons to enter the university. Accordingly, in 1818, Howe's father had him enrolled at Brown University. Most of his time there was spent engaged in practical jokes and other hi-jinx and, years later, Howe told his children that he regretted that he hadn’t more seriously applied himself to his studies. One of his classmates, Alexis Caswell, became a doctor and future president of Brown University; he described Howe by the following: “He showed mental capabilities which would naturally fit him for fine scholarship. <b>His</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> quick, versatile, and inventive. I do not think he was deficient in logical power, but the severer studies did not seem to be congenial to him.” After graduating from Brown in 1821, Howe attended Harvard Medical School, taking his degree in 1824.|$|E
25|$|During {{the visit}} of James I to Cambridge in March 1615, Preston {{distinguished}} himself as a disputant. He was chosen by Samuel Harsnett, the vice-chancellor, as 'answerer' in the philosophy act, but this place was successfully claimed by Matthew Wren, and Preston took the post of first opponent. His biographer, Thomas Ball, gives {{an account of the}} disputation on the question 'Whether dogs could make syllogismes'. Preston maintained that they could. James was delighted with his argument (which Granger thinks Preston borrowed from a well-known passage in Montaigne's Essays), and introduced a dog story of his own. 'It was easy to discerne that ye kings hound had opened a way for Mr. Preston at ye court'. Sir Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke, became his firm friend (he ultimately settled £50 a year upon him). But Preston had by this time given up his early ambition; though he said little of his purpose, <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> set on the ministry, and he was reading modern divinity, especially Calvin.|$|E

25|$|A {{year before}} this, Manchester {{would have asked}} for and acted upon {{the advice of a}} capable soldier, such as Cromwell or Crawford. Now, however, <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> warped by a desire for peace on any terms, and he sought only to avoid defeat, pending a happy {{solution}} of the quarrel. Those who sought to gain peace through victory were, meanwhile, driving Maurice back from hedge to hedge towards the open ground at Newbury. But every attempt to emerge from the lanes and fields was repulsed by the royal cavalry, and indeed, by every available man and horse. Charles's officers had gauged Manchester's intentions, and almost stripped the front of its defenders to stop Waller's advance. Nightfall {{put an end to the}} struggle around Newbury, and then too late, Manchester ordered the attack on Shaw House. It failed completely, in spite of the gallantry of his men, and darkness being then complete, it was not renewed.|$|E
25|$|Edited by the {{distinguished}} historian Sir Arthur Bryant, the diaries were first released (in abridged versions) during 1957 (The Turn of the Tide) and 1959 (Triumph in the West). Originally the diaries were {{never meant to}} be published. One reason why Alanbrooke (as he had become) changed <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> the lack of credit to him and the Chiefs of Staff in Churchill's own war memoirs, which essentially presented their ideas and innovations as the Prime Minister's own. Although censorship and libel laws accounted for numerous suppressions of what Alan Brooke had originally written concerning persons who were still alive, the books became controversial even in their truncated state. This was not only {{as a result of the}} many comments on Churchill and others, but also because they launched the idea of Brooke as being, ultimately, the sole commander behind the Allies' victory. Churchill himself did not appreciate the books. In 2001 the publication of the uncensored War Diaries, edited by Alex Danchev and Daniel Todman, again attracted attention to one of the most influential strategists of the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} two years of World War II, {{although}} he prepared his documents and received a special passport, Janco was still undecided. He was still in Romania when the Iron Guard established its National Legionary State. He was receiving and helping Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe, and hearing from them about the concentration camp system, but refused offers to emigrate into a neutral or Allied country. <b>His</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> made up in January 1941, when the Iron Guard's struggle for maintaining power resulted in the Bucharest Pogrom. Janco himself was a personal witness to the violent events, noting for instance that the Nazi German bystanders would declare themselves impressed by the Guard's murderous efficiency, or how the thugs made an example of the Jews trapped in the Choral Temple. The Străulești Abbatoir murders and the stories of Jewish survivors also inspired several of Janco's drawings. One of the victims of the Abbatoir massacre was Costin's brother Michael Goldschlager. He was kidnapped from his house by Guardsmen, and his corpse was among those found hanging on hooks, mutilated in such way as to mock the Jewish kashrut ritual.|$|E

25|$|The {{visit of}} Pope John Paul II to Ireland in September {{proved to be}} a welcome break for Lynch from the day-to-day running of the country. In November, just before Lynch {{departed}} on a visit to the United States he decided that he would resign {{at the end of the}} year. This would allow him to complete his term as President of the European Community. The defining event which made up <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> the news that Fianna Fáil had lost two by-elections in his native Cork (Cork City and Cork North-East, both on 7 November). In addition during the trip Lynch claimed in an interview with the Washington Post that a five-kilometre air corridor between the border was agreed upon during the meeting with Thatcher to enhance security co-operation This was something highly unsavoury to many in Fianna Fáil. When Lynch returned he was confronted openly by Síle de Valera, Dr Bill Loughnane, a noted hardline Republican backbencher, along with Tom McEllistrim, a member of Haughey's gang of five, at a parliamentary party meeting. Lynch stated that the British did not have permission to overfly the border. Afterwards Loughnane went public with the details of the meeting and accused Lynch of deliberately misleading the party. An attempt to remove the whip from Loughnane failed. At this stage Lynch's position had become untenable, with supporters of Haughey caucusing opinion within the party.|$|E

When <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> removed entirely from the field of prayer, he was but little changed from his sane state. His powers of reason, though thus warped, were not taken from him, and he neither raved nor sank into mental lethargy.|$|E

[...] In the same interview, he stated that the {{cognitive}} part of <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> [...] "untouched" [...] and his symptoms were physical (normal for PCA). However, in July 2014 he cancelled his appearance at the biennial International Discworld Convention, saying: [...] "the Embuggerance is finally catching up with me, along with other age-related ailments".|$|E

While Spock's bodily resurrection was complete, <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> a blank slate—The Search for Spock, Michele and Duncan Barrett argue, says that the important question is whether an individual's mind functions, as {{this is the key}} to a meaningful existence.|$|E
500|$|Daniels {{was educated}} at Manor Park School, a state {{comprehensive}} school in Nuneaton, near Coventry, in Warwickshire (since closed). According to Daniels, drama lessons at O-levels {{gave him a}} voice, and when he attended sixth form studies at Stratford College between 1980 and 1982, doing A-levels in theatre studies and English literature, he attended Royal Shakespeare Company performances. A fellow student recalled that Daniels, whom he knew as Dave, [...] "was very serious about his work, and struck me as incredibly intelligent... you got the sense <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> working; the cogs were ticking over". Daniels subsequently trained at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA) for three years.|$|E
500|$|The match {{attracted}} fervent debate amongst journalists, pundits {{and football}} players alike. Former referee Jeff Winter defended Riley's performance and described fixtures between Manchester United and Arsenal as [...] "impossible" [...] to manage. Premier League refereeing chief Keith Hackett added: [...] "We {{know this is}} one of the tough encounters of the season. Mike clearly had a game plan to try not to suppress the match. He wanted it to breathe and perhaps went in with the intention of getting through the game without having to dismiss any players. In the back of <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> trying to get through a game without having a blow-up and I think Mike did extremely well to keep a lid on things." ...|$|E
