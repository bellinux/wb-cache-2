50|$|It {{is a form}} of <b>fluid</b> <b>instability</b> {{found in}} {{thermally}} stratified atmospheres in which a colder fluid overlies a warmer one. When an air mass is unstable, the element of the air mass that is displaced upwards is accelerated by the pressure differential between the displaced air and the ambient air at the (higher) altitude to which it was displaced. This usually creates vertically developed clouds from convection, due to the rising motion, which can eventually lead to thunderstorms. It could also be created in other phenomenon, such as a cold front. Even if the air is cooler on the surface, there is still warmer air in the mid-levels, that can rise into the upper-levels. However, if there is not enough water vapor present, there is no ability for condensation, thus storms, clouds, and rain will not form.|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of <b>fluid</b> <b>instabilities</b> {{in the relevant}} limit of vanishing fluid inertia (i. e., arbitrarily close to zero Reynolds number) has been investigated for the well-known Kolmogorov flow. The time-lagged viscosity change from lower to higher values due to shear changes is the crucial ingredient for the instabilities to emerge. This behavior characterizes the so-called rheopectic <b>fluids.</b> The <b>instability</b> does not emerge in shear-thinning or -thickening fluids where viscosity adjustment to local shear occurs instantaneously. No instability arbitrarily close to zero Reynolds number is either observed in thixotropic fluids, even though the viscosity adjustment time to shear is finite like in rheopectic fluids. Numerical tools (through suitable eigenvalue problems from the linear stability analysis) and multiple-scale homogenization techniques are utilized to lead to our conclusions. Our findings may have important consequences in all situations where purely hydrodynamic <b>fluid</b> <b>instabilities</b> or mixing are inhibited due to negligible inertia, such as in microfluidics.

40|$|Magnetar-powered {{supernova}} explosions are competitive {{models for}} explaining very luminous optical transits. However, these explosion models were mainly calculated in 1 D. Radiation emitted from the magnetar snowplows into the previous supernovae ejecta and causes a nonphysical dense shell (spike) found in previous 1 D studies. This suggests that strong <b>fluid</b> <b>instabilities</b> may have developed within the magnetar-powered supernovae. Such <b>fluid</b> <b>instabilities</b> emerge at {{the region where}} luminous transits later occur, so they can affect the consequent observational signatures.

40|$|Recently, {{simulations}} {{of the collapse}} of massive stars showed that selected models of the QCD phase transitions to deconfined quarks during the early postbounce phase can trigger the supernova explosion that has been searched for over many years in spherically symmetric supernova models. Using sophisticated general relativistic Boltzmann neutrino transport, it was found that a characteristic neutrino signature is emitted that permits to falsify or identify this scenario in the next Galactic supernova event. On the other hand, more refined observations of past supernovae and progressing theoretical research in different supernova groups demonstrated that the effects of multidimensional <b>fluid</b> <b>instabilities</b> cannot be neglected in global models of the explosions of massive stars.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of <b>ﬂuid</b> <b>instabilities</b> {{in the relevant}} limit of vanishing ﬂuid inertia (i. e., arbitrarily close to zero Reynolds number) has been investigated for the well-known Kolmogorov ﬂow. The ﬁnite-time shear-induced order-disorder transition of the non-Newtonian microstructure and the corresponding viscosity change from lower to higher values are the crucial ingredients for the instabilities to emerge. The ﬁnite-time low-to-high viscosity change for increasing shear characterizes the rheopectic <b>ﬂuids.</b> The <b>instability</b> does not emerge in shear-thinning or -thickening ﬂuids where viscosity adjustment to local shear occurs instantaneously. The lack of instabilities arbitrarily close to zero Reynolds number is also observed for thixotropic ﬂuids, {{in spite of the}} fact that the viscosity adjustment time to shear is ﬁnite as in rheopectic ﬂuids. Renormalized perturbative expansions (multiple-scale expansions), energy-based arguments (on the linearized equations of motion), and numerical results (of suitable eigenvalue problems from the linear stability analysis) are the main tools leading to our conclusions.

40|$|The {{explosion}} {{mechanism of}} core-collapse supernovae {{has not been}} fully understood yet but multi-dimensional <b>fluid</b> <b>instabilities</b> such as standing accretion shock instability (SASI) and convection are now believed to be crucial for shock revival. Another multi-dimensional effect that has been recently argued is the asymmetric structures in progenitors, which are induced by violent convections in silicon/oxygen layers that occur {{before the onset of}} collapse, as revealed by recent numerical simulations of the last stage of massive star evolutions. Furthermore, it has been also demonstrated numerically that accretions of such non-spherical envelopes could facilitate shock revival. These two multi-dimensional may hence hold a key to successful explosions. In this paper, we performed a linear stability analysis of the standing accretion shock in core-collapse supernovae, taking into account non-spherical, unsteady accretion flows onto the shock to clarify the possible links between the two effects.

40|$|The "Nessie" Nebula is a {{filamentary}} infrared {{dark cloud}} (IRDC) {{with a large}} aspect ratio of over 150 : 1 (1. 5 degrees x 0. 01 degrees, or 80 pc x 0. 5 pc at a kinematic distance of 3. 1 kpc). Maps of HNC (1 - 0) emission, a tracer of dense molecular gas, made with the Australia Telescope National Facility Mopra telescope, show an excellent morphological match to the mid-IR extinction. Moreover, because the molecular line emission from the entire nebula has the same radial velocity to within +/- 3. 4 km/s, the nebula is a single, coherent cloud and not the chance alignment of multiple unrelated clouds {{along the line of}} sight. The Nessie Nebula contains a number of compact, dense molecular cores which have a characteristic projected spacing of ~ 4. 5 pc along the filament. The theory of gravitationally bound gaseous cylinders predicts the existence of such cores, which, due to the "sausage" or "varicose" <b>fluid</b> <b>instability,</b> fragment from the cylinder at a characteristic length scale. If turbulent pressure dominates over thermal pressure in Nessie, then the observed core spacing matches theoretical predictions. We speculate that the formation of high-mass stars and massive star clusters arises from the fragmentation of filamentary IRDCs caused by the "sausage" <b>fluid</b> <b>instability</b> that leads to the formation of massive, dense molecular cores.
