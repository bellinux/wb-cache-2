5|$|The new editor was Ejler Jakobsson, though Pohl {{continued}} to be listed as editor emeritus on the masthead until the July–August 1970 issue. Much of the editorial work was actually done by Judy-Lynn Benjamin, who was hired by Pohl in 1969 as an editorial assistant. The new regime failed to impress readers, and circulation dropped from over 67,000 for the year ending October 1968 to under 45,000 the following year, a drop of over 30%. If went bimonthly in May 1970, as Abramson attempted to juggle the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>publication</b> of several of his titles to maximize profits; the page count and price were also adjusted more than once over the next year, again increasing profitability. Abramson also began a British distribution of If, reprinted with a separate cover, priced in British currency. Circulation figures of the time show an increase of about 6,000 copies, but if this includes sales in the UK is not clear.|$|E

The first issue had a publication date of October 1950, and the schedule was bimonthly through the September 1952 issue except that June 1951 was followed by September 1951. The next four issues were dated October 1952, December 1952, January 1953 and February 1953, and then a monthly run began with April 1953 that lasted without a break until the July 1955 issue. The next issue was October 1955, which inaugurated another bimonthly period that ran with perfect regularity until the last issue, October 1958. The price remained at 35cents throughout.|$|E

[...] From 1875 onwards the editor-in-chief was Teofil Głębocki. [...] The paper was often published with extra supplements with separate mastheads that read, Dodatek do Nr... Kurjera Lubelskiego ("Supplement to No... of The Kurjer Lubelski"), etc. [...] The frequency (as well as the format) of publication underwent significant variations throughout the newspaper's history, {{but it was not a}} daily newspaper (excluding Sundays and bank holidays) until 1878. [...] From 1875 the newspaper appeared without the volume number being indicated in the masthead. [...] In 1879 the publication merged with the Gazeta Lubelska and continued publication under the latter title [...] not to be reactivated independently as Kurjer Lubelski until 1906 when this was done on the initiative of Mieczysław Biernacki whose efforts spelled the beginning of a golden age in the newspaper's life. [...] The first issue of the revived Kurjer Lubelski, published on 4January 1906 under the editorship of Władysław Stodolnicki, was initially followed by only 15 additional numbers. [...] However, the newspaper survived, rising to the premier position among the press of the Lublin Land, until it was banned by the censorship of the Russian Empire on 27June 1913. [...] During its second phase the publication was associated with such personages who served on the editorial board as Stefan Żeromski, Witold Chodźko, Mieczysław Biernacki, the well-known physician and social activist Aleksander Staniszewski (18581926), and most memorably the philosopher Jan Hempel (18771937) who acted as secretary to the Board.|$|E
