40|$|AbstractMalaysia {{is facing}} haze {{problems}} {{for many years}} and the Government’s major budget has been utilized for eradicating this issue so as to provide a healthy environment for its people. Apart from the peat and forest fires, the electricity genera-tion through <b>fossil-fuelled</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> also significantly contributes to the environmental issues in Malaysia. For the sustainable development of the country and to become a prime land in the Asean region, the Government of Malaysia has {{to pay more attention to}} exterminate the ongoing haze problem. During haze, as the power plant emissions augment the environmental issues, two operational strategies of <b>fossil-fuelled</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> are presented to reduce their emissions. The efficacy of the proposed strategies has been demonstrated through a 24 -bus, 11 fossil-fuelled generator test system at different load conditions during a 24 -hour period...|$|R
50|$|As of 2012 none of {{the power}} {{generators}} appear {{to be committed to}} the construction of any new <b>fossil-fuelled</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations.</b> However, for several years there have been two unactioned but reasonably well defined proposals for gas-fired <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> with 880 MW of generating capacity in the Auckland area.

40|$|It is now {{essential}} for engineers to recognise the environmental hazards {{which may be}} associated with their constructions and to make proper allowance from them when costing different solutions to a problem. Both nuclear and <b>fossil-fuelled</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> present environmental hazards, and these can be traced from mines through processing plants to <b>power</b> <b>station</b> wastes. It is necessary that engineers develop an appropriate basis of comparison if they are to assess the relative environmental costs of nuclear and <b>fossil-fuelled</b> <b>power</b> stations; this must allow for effects on health, ecological effects and aesthetic effects. The biological effects of radiation have been fairly well quantified with respect to major exposures, but there is still uncertainty on the precise form of dose-response relationships at low doses, such as might be relevant to industrial and public health. There are also uncertainties for non-radioactive pollutants, and it is probably not very logical to treat the dose-effect relationships of radioactive and chemical pollutants as being quite different in nature, as is commonly done at present. There are internationally accepted standards for allowable radiation exposure. It is possible to base allowable discharges of radioactive contaminants to the environment on these standards, provided the modes of dispersion are understood and possible pathways to the exposure of man are recognised. The philosophy of radiation protection recognises that although radiation risks can be made very small, they cannot be abolished entirely, and that these risks must be balanced against the benefits of using radiation. These risks can be quantified and compared with other hazards of work and life which people accept, voluntarily or involuntarily. There are insufficient data available on the effects of health of various pollutants, and there is too little public agreement on the relative worth of mined and unmined natural resources, to allow a detailed comparison of the environmental hazards of nuclear and <b>fossil-fuelled</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations,</b> but it is possible to begin this comparison in limited areas...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, Carbon Capture and Storage (Sequestration) (CCS) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a potential method to allow the continued use of <b>fossil-fuelled</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> whilst preventing emissions of CO 2 from reaching the atmosphere. Gas, coat (and biomass) -fired <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> can respond to changes in demand more readily than many other sources of electricity production, hence the importance of retaining them as an option in the energy mix. Here, we review the leading CO 2 capture technologies, available in the short and long term, and their technological maturity, before discussing CO 2 transport and storage. Current pilot plants and demonstrations are highlighted, as {{is the importance of}} optimising the CCS system as a whole.

Finally, we discuss the economic and legal aspects of CCS...|$|R
40|$|A test {{facility}} was constructed to conduct experimental investigation of erosion caused by gas-borne ash particles. The {{test facility}} {{was used to}} carry out the main objective of the study which was the determination of the critical angle of attack that gives maximum erosion on the target material, mild steel, and the effect of particle velocity and concentration on the erosion of the target material. The tests were carried out using ash samples from three different Eskom <b>fossil-fuelled</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations,</b> namely Matimba <b>Power</b> <b>Station,</b> Matla <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> and Lethabo <b>Power</b> <b>Station.</b> The selection of the ash samples was based on the ash chemical composition that has the highest content of the chemical elements that have a significant influence in the material erosion of the target material. These chemical elements are quartz and other abrasive materials. These ash samples had a high content of these erosive materials. The first test that was carried out in this study was the determination of the critical angle of attack that gives maximum erosion on the target material. It was decided to start by doing this test because the velocity and concentration tests needed a predefined critical angle of attack that gives maximum erosion on the target material. During the velocity and concentration tests the angle of attack was kept at the predefined critical angle of attack. The results in this study indicate that the critical angle of attack that gives maximum erosion on the target material is at 27 º ± 3 º orientation of the target surface. The velocity test results indicate that the material erosion rate increases with increasing velocity. The results produced a power relationship between erosion rate and velocity. In this power relationship the velocity exponent for the three ash samples was found to be in the range between 2. 42 and 3. 64. The concentration test results also indicate that the material erosion rate increases with increasing particle concentration. These results produced a linear relationship between erosion rate and particle concentration...|$|R
40|$|Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) {{has been}} {{highlighted}} {{as a potential}} method to enable the continued use of <b>fossil-fuelled</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> through the abatement of carbon dioxide (CO 2). A complete CCS cycle requires safe, reliable and cost effective solutions for the transmission of CO 2 from the capturing facility {{to the location of}} permanent storage. This publication presents a detailed review of the integrity risks posed to dense-phase CO 2 pipelines in the form of internal corrosion. To begin, the current worldwide experience in handling dense-phase CO 2 and the anthropogenic stream compositions expected from the different combustion techniques currently available are discussed. The anticipated compositions are then related to a number of tentative CO 2 stream compositions available in open literature proposed by research institutes and pipeline operators. In subsequent sections, early laboratory and field corrosion experience relating to natural dense-phase CO 2 transport for the purposes of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) are summarised along with more recent research efforts which focus on identifying the role of anthropogenic impurities in the degradation processes. For each system impurity, the reaction rates, mechanisms and corrosion product composition/morphology expected at the steel surfaces are discussed, as well as each component’s ability to influence the critical water content required to initiate corrosion. Potential bulk phase reactions between multiple impurities are also evaluated in an attempt to help understand how the impurity content may evolve along a long-distance pipeline. The likelihood of stress-corrosion cracking and hydrogen-induced cracking is discussed and the various corrosion mitigation techniques which exist to control degradation to acceptable levels are reviewed. Based on the current research performed in the context of impure dense-phase CO 2 corrosion, issues associated with performing laboratory experiments to replicate field conditions and the challenges such limitations present in terms of defining the safe operating window for CO 2 transport are considered...|$|R
40|$|Even minimal {{improvements}} in particle collection efficiency of electrostatic precipitators significantly reduce dust emission from <b>fossil-fuelled</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> and reduce pollution. Yet current designs {{rely on the}} Deutsch collection theory, which was developed for tubular precipitators and {{has been applied to}} wire-plate precipitators {{on the assumption that the}} inter-electrode electric fields at the same discharge distance in both were similar. Differences in geometry and associated collector electric fields and current density non-uniformity have not been taken into account, although the collector electric field and current density of the wire-plate precipitator are not uniform. And observations show that precipitated dust patterns and the distribution of collector current density are interrelated. Investigations revealed a simple square law relationship between the collector electric field and the collector current density in the space charge dominated coronas. Applying this relationship to the Deutsch collection theory led to a current-density-based collection formula that takes into account the non-uniform collector current density distribution. The current-density-based collection formula is then used to assess the impact of collector current density on collection efficiency, the results closely following published measurements. Applying the current-density-based collection formula to estimate the dust accumulation shows that most of the dust accumulates at collector locations facing the corona wires. The effect of the non-uniform precipitated dust layer on collection performance is assessed using the distributed corona impedance - the ratio of the inter-electrode voltage and the non-uniform collector current. Re-distribution of the collector current profile as dust builds up is also compatible with published measurements. Finally this is applied to optimize the wire-plate precipitator collection performance. This shows that optimal collection performance is obtained with the wire-wire spacing less than the wire-plate distance, once again confirming published experimental results. This is the first analytical approach to show better collection performance can be achieved at the ratio of wire-wire spacing/wire-plate distance not equal to unity, which has been the standard industry practice since 1960...|$|R
40|$|P 91 and P 92 steels are two ASTM {{grades of}} steel {{which have been}} used in high {{temperature}} applications, such as <b>fossil-fuelled</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations,</b> nuclear <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> and chemical plants. Operating under creep conditions, i. e. high temperature and/or high stress, the welds made from these steels are potential failure locations and, therefore, life limiting for the entire plant. In this thesis, the results of creep and creep crack growth (CCG) tests, which were carried out on P 91 and P 92 welds, are reported. These tests were carried out on welds constituents, i. e. parent materials (PM) and weld metal (WM), and across-welds, for the P 91 material at 650 °C and for the P 92 material at 675 °C. For the cross-weld tests, interest was focused on the Type IV region, a narrow zone {{at one end of the}} heat affected zone (HAZ) at the side of the PM. Also reported, in this thesis, are the results of the Finite Element analyses for predicting the creep and creep crack growth in the P 91 and P 92 materials. For the P 91 material, CCG tests were carried out on PM and cross-weld CT specimens, at 650 °C. The results of the CCG tests for P 91 show that the CCG rates for the cross-weld CT specimens are about ten times higher than those for the PM specimens. For P 92, uniaxial and notched bar creep tests were carried out on the PM and WM, at 675 °C. Cross-weld uniaxial, notched bar and waisted specimens were also tested in order to characterise the creep behaviour of the P 92 HAZ material. Impression creep tests were also carried out on the P 92 HAZ material. The results of the CCG tests for P 92 show that the CCG rates for the cross-weld CT specimens are about two times higher than these for the PM CT specimens. The fracture mechanics parameter, C*, was used to correlate the CCG rates in the P 91 and P 92 CT specimens. The load line displacement rates and the CCG data, for the CT specimens, were used to calculate C* values according to ASTM E 1457 - 00 (2001). The Reference Stress was also found to correlate the CCG rates in the P 91 CT specimens. Further, FE analyses were carried out to obtain the values of C*, based on the steady state value of the contour integral C(t). Stationary crack and growing crack CT models were used to obtain the C* values. Damage mechanics theory and equations were used to predict the creep and CCG for the P 91 and P 92 materials using the commercial FE package, ABAQUS. Both the Kachanov and the Liu and Murakami damage models were used. In order to use these models, material properties have to be determined. The results of creep and creep rupture tests were used to determine those properties. It was found that both damage models could be used to predict the creep behaviour of the tested materials. However, the Liu and Murakami model was favoured over the Kachanov model in predicting the CCG in the CT specimens. The effect of the material multiaxiality is also highlighted.

40|$|Using {{fossil fuels}} {{is likely to}} remain the {{dominant}} means of producing electricity in 2030 and even 2050, partly because <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> have long lives. There are two main ways of reducing CO 2 emissions from <b>fossil-fuelled</b> <b>power</b> plants. These are carbon capture and storage (CCS), which can produce near-zero CO 2 emissions, and increases in plant efficiency, which can give rise to significant reductions in CO 2 emissions and to reduced costs. If a typical UK coal-fired plant was replaced by today's best available technology, it would lead to reductions of around 25 % in emissions of CO 2 per MWÂ h of electricity produced. Future technologies are targeting even larger reductions in emissions, as well as providing a route, with CCS, to zero emissions. These two routes are linked and they are both essential activities on the pathway to zero emissions. This paper focuses on the second route and also covers an additional third route for reducing emissions, the use of biomass. It discusses the current status of the science and technologies for <b>fossil-fuelled</b> <b>power</b> generation and outlines likely future technologies, development targets and timescales. This is followed by a description of the scientific and technological developments that are needed to meet these challenges. Once built, a power plant can last for over 40 years, so the ability to upgrade and retrofit a plant during its lifetime is important. Clean fossil...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Following {{a review}} of {{thermodynamic}} processes in a generalized <b>fossil-fuelled</b> <b>power</b> system, the theoretical efficiencies of systems based on the isothermal oxidation of methane are discussed. The fuel cell is introduced as a device that converts the change of Gibbs free energy (DG) in isothermal oxidation directly to electricity. Ideal efficiencies of fuel cell systems are presented. The Gibbs free energy change in isothermal oxidation of methane is 99 per cent of its lower heating value (LHV). However, direct electrochemical oxidation is not practical yet. Taking this and other factors into account the reversible electrical work from an internally reforming fuel cell could represent 79 per cent of the lower heating value at 600 C, falling to 67 per cent at 1000 C. With a bottoming heat engine the combined reversible work could be> 80 per cent of LHV over this range. Adding such a device as a top-ping element to a conventional heat engine based system seems a logical {{next step in the}} evolution of the efficient <b>fossil-fuelled</b> <b>power</b> plant...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a view {{into the long}} term future of <b>fossil-fuelled</b> <b>power</b> generation in the European Union, based {{on a number of}} alternative scenarios {{for the development of the}} coal, natural gas and CO 2 markets, and the penetration of renewable and nuclear technologies. The new fossil fuelled capacity needed and the likely technology mix are estimated using a cost optimisation model based on the screening curve method, taking into consideration the rate of retirement of the current power plant fleet, the capacity already planned or under construction and the role of carbon capture and storage technologies. This analysis shows that measures to increase both non-fossil-fuel-based power generation and the price of CO 2 are necessary to drive the composition of the European power generation capacity so that the European policy goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is achieved. Meeting this goal will however require a high capital investment for the creation of an optimal fossil fuel power plant technology mix. <b>Fossil-fuelled</b> <b>power</b> generation Carbon capture and storage CO 2 emissions...|$|R

40|$|Environmentalists and {{environmental}} scientists have criticized wind energy in various forums for its negative impacts on wildlife, especially birds. This article highlights that nuclear <b>power</b> and <b>fossil-fuelled</b> <b>power</b> systems have {{a host of}} environmental and wildlife costs as well, particularly for birds. Therefore, as a low-emission, low-pollution energy source, the wider use of wind energy can save wildlife and birds as it displaces these more harmful sources of electricity. The paper provides two examples: one relates to a calculation of avian fatalities across wind electricity, fossil-fueled, and nuclear power systems in the entire United States. It estimates that wind farms are responsible for roughly 0. 27 avian fatalities per gigawatt-hour (GWh) of electricity while nuclear power plants involve 0. 6 fatalities per GWh and fossil-fueled <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> are responsible for about 9. 4 fatalities per GWh. Within the uncertainties of the data used, the estimate means that wind farm-related avian fatalities equated to approximately 46, 000 birds in the United States in 2009, but nuclear power plants killed about 460, 000 and fossil-fueled power plants 24 million. A second example summarizes the wildlife benefits from a 580 -MW wind farm at Altamont Pass in California, a facility that some have criticized for its impact on wildlife.
