40|$|Abstract—Curvelets <b>denoise</b> {{approach}} has been widely used in many fields {{for its ability to}} obtain high quality result images. However artifacts those appear in the result images of curvelets approach prevent its application in some fields such as medical image. A <b>denoise</b> algorithm is proposed to perform pixel fusion to result images of curvelets and wavelets approaches. Firstly curvelets <b>denoise</b> result image and hidden Markov tree based wavelets <b>denoise</b> result image are calculated. Then image regions are analyzed with quadtree decomposition. Finally result images are obtained with weighted pixel fusion method. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm improves the visual quality of result images efficiently and suppresses the artifacts in result images evidently. And the results of the algorithm applied to ultrasonic medical images also indicate that the algorithm can be used efficiently in medical image fields.

2500|$|One {{of the key}} {{principles}} of dictionary learning is that the dictionary has to be inferred from the input data. The emergence of sparse dictionary learning methods was stimulated {{by the fact that}} in signal processing one typically wants to represent the input data using as few components as possible. Before this approach the general practice was to use predefined dictionaries (such as fourier or wavelet transforms). However, in certain cases a dictionary that is trained to fit the input data can significantly improve the sparsity, which has applications in data decomposition, compression and analysis and has been used in the fields of image <b>denoising</b> and classification, video and audio processing. Sparsity and overcomplete dictionaries have immense applications in image compression, image fusion and inpainting.|$|E

To solve this problem, a new <b>denoise</b> method based on {{based on the}} fractal dimension, higher order statistics and local tangent space arrangement is proposed. The intrinsic dimension is estimated as dimension of reduction targets by fractal geometry method, the data outside intrinsic dimension space will be regarded as noise signal to be eliminated. At the same time, making use of restraining characteristic to colored noise of high-order cumulan, covariance matrix is constructed with the fourth-order cumulant function instead of second-order moment function covariance matrix,local tangent space alignment algorithm based on fourth-order cumulan is also proposed. Noise reduction experiments on lorenz signal and fan’s vibrating signal show that method proposed in this paper has better <b>denoise</b> effect.

Schmidt et al. use NMF to do speech <b>denoising</b> under non-stationary noise, which is completely different from classical statistical approaches. The key idea is that clean speech signal can be sparsely represented by a speech dictionary, but non-stationary noise cannot. Similarly, non-stationary noise can also be sparsely represented by a noise dictionary, but speech cannot.|$|E
