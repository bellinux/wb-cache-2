40|$|The present work {{deals with}} a thermo-fluid {{analysis}} of a collinear cylindrical ohmic heater in laminar flow. The geometry of interest is a circular <b>electrical</b> <b>insulated</b> glass pipe with two electrodes at the pipe ends. For this application, since the electrical conductivity of a liquid food strongly depends on the temperature, the thermal analysis of an ohmic heater requires the simultaneous solution of the electric and thermal fields In the present work {{the analysis of the}} above fields has been decoupled by means of an iterative procedure. The thermal field has been calculated by means of an analytical solution, which leads to fast calculations for the temperature distribution in the heater.

40|$|Introduction Safe {{hands-on}} defibrillation (HOD) {{will allow}} uninterrupted chest compression during defibrillation and may improve resuscitation success. We tested {{the ability of}} <b>electrical</b> <b>insulating</b> gloves to protect the rescuer during HOD using a ‘worst case’ electrical scenario. Materials and method Leakage current flowing from the patient to the ‘rescuer’ during antero-lateral defibrillation of patients undergoing elective cardioversion was measured. The ‘rescuer’ maintained firm (20 kgf) contact with the patient during defibrillation, wearing Class 1 <b>electrical</b> <b>insulating</b> gloves while simulating an inadvertent contact with the patient, through an additional wired contact between ‘rescuer’ and patient. Results Data from 61 shocks from 43 different patients were recorded. The median leakage current from all defibrillations was 20. 0 ?A, (range: 2. 0 – 38. 5). In total, 18 of the shocks were delivered at 360 J and had a median leakage current of 27. 0 ?A (range: 14. 3 – 38. 5). Conclusion When using Class 1 <b>electrical</b> <b>insulating</b> gloves for hands-on defibrillation, rescuer leakage current is significantly below the 1 mA safe threshold, allowing safe hands-on defibrillation if the rescuer makes only one other point of contact with the patient...|$|R
