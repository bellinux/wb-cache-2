5|$|It is {{believed}} that some Irish MacIntyres descend <b>from</b> <b>native</b> Irish stock whose ancestors {{were living in the}} same areas in which Scottish MacIntyres settled and who assumed the Scottish surname, rather than Macateer, as an anglicization of the Irish name Mac an tSoir.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years in western Virginia, pioneer {{settlers}} were primarily concerned with providing defense <b>from</b> <b>Native</b> American attacks, so little emphasis was placed upon education. Education {{was viewed as a}} religious duty, to be provided for at home, where its quality was dependent upon the spare time and level of education of parents. With the growth of settlement in Pearsall's Flats, and later Romney, the need for educational facilities became apparent and the community began plans for the establishment of schools and churches.|$|E

5|$|While {{most major}} U.S. sports have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, {{some of which}} have become popular in other countries. Lacrosse and surfing arose <b>from</b> <b>Native</b> American and Native Hawaiian {{activities}} that predate Western contact. The most watched individual sports are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR. Rugby union is considered the fastest growing sport in the U.S., with registered players numbered at 115,000+ and a further 1.2 million participants.|$|E
5|$|After {{succeeding}} {{his father}} in 997, Stephen had {{to fight for the}} throne against his relative, Koppány, who was supported by large numbers of pagan warriors.

He was crowned on 25 December 1000 or 1 January 1001 with a crown sent by Pope Sylvester II. In a series of wars against semi-independent tribes and chieftainsincluding the Black Hungarians and his uncle, Gyula the Youngerhe unified the Carpathian Basin.

However, {{the return of the}} Hurons logo has prompted protests <b>from</b> <b>Native</b> Americans at the university and in the local community, who state that the old mascot promotes stereotypes and hostility.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{combination}} of political and strategic decisions, it was almost two years before the battalion went into combat again. In late 1944, in order to free up American troops for operations in the Philippines, Australian forces were directed to take over responsibility for operations around Aitape in New Guinea. The 6th Division returned to New Guinea in November 1944, with the final brigade arriving on 31 December 1944. Although basically cut off from resupply, there were around 35,000 Japanese troops in the area, holding the coast past Wewak and into the interior. Supported by food supplies <b>from</b> <b>native</b> gardens in the Torricelli Mountains, the Japanese put up heavy resistance to the Australians' primary tactic of aggressive patrolling.|$|E

5|$|Explorers {{searching for}} the fabled Northwest Passage and large inland seas in North America {{continued}} to pass through this region. Fort Beauharnois was built by the French in 1721 on Lake Pepin to facilitate exploration. In the 17th century a lucrative trade developed between Native Americans who trapped animals near the Great Lakes and traders who shipped the animal furs to Europe. For two centuries this trade network was the prime economic driver in the area. A notable result of this trade network was the Métis people, a mixed-race community descended <b>from</b> <b>Native</b> Americans and French traders, {{as well as other}} mixed-race peoples. In particular during the latter 18th century numerous French and English traders in the Minnesota region purchased Sioux wives in order to establish kinship relationships with the Sioux so as to secure their supply of furs from the tribes.|$|E
5|$|In 1776, the Sejm {{commissioned}} former chancellor Andrzej Zamoyski {{to draft}} a new legal code. By 1780, he and his collaborators had produced the Zamoyski Code (Zbiór praw sądowych). It would have strengthened royal power, made all officials answerable to the Sejm, placed the clergy and their finances under state supervision, and deprived landless szlachta of many of their legal immunities. The Code would also have improved the situation of non-noblestownspeople and peasants. Zamoyski's progressive legal code, containing elements of constitutional reform, met with opposition <b>from</b> <b>native</b> conservative szlachta and foreign powers; the 1780 Sejm did not adopt it.|$|E
5|$|In his poetry, Chivers {{made use}} of legends and themes <b>from</b> <b>Native</b> American culture, {{particularly}} the Cherokee, though often with Christian overtones. He was also heavily influenced {{by the work of}} François-René de Chateaubriand and Emanuel Swedenborg. Many of Chivers's poems included themes of death and sorrow, often using images of shrouds, coffins, angels, and reunions with lost loves in the afterlife. Religious conventions at the time made discussion of death popular, as was reflected in poetry. Because of his background as a doctor, Chivers was able to graphically depict the last moments before someone's death.|$|E

5|$|McConnell Island was {{purchased}} {{at the end of}} World War II by Thomas Gordon Thompson, a University of Washington professor and U.S. Army chemical warfare researcher who was later the namesake of the USNS Thomas Thompson and R/V Thomas Thompson. Thompson financed the purchase of the island through the sale of his valuable stamp collection and later built a home on it <b>from</b> <b>native</b> stone and driftwood. During his proprietorship of the remote island, Thompson used it to entertain friends and guests from the nearby Friday Harbor Laboratories. In one summer alone he received more than 700 visitors.|$|E
5|$|Smith disbanded Ross's {{company in}} early September 1860. Within a week, Governor Sam Houston {{authorized}} Ross {{to raise his}} own company of 60 mounted volunteers to protect the settlements near Belknap <b>from</b> <b>Native</b> American attacks. Ross and his men arrived at Fort Belknap on October 17, 1860 to find the local citizens they were sworn to protect had passed a resolution asking Ross to resign his commission and leave the frontier. The citizens erroneously believed the raiding was committed by Native Americans from the reservations, and they feared Ross's friendship with those on the reservations would make him ineffective.|$|E
5|$|Soegijapranata {{left for}} Semarang on 30September 1940 and was consecrated by Willekens on 6October at the Holy Rosary Church in Randusari, which later became his seat; this consecration made Soegijapranata the first native Indonesian bishop. The {{ceremony}} {{was attended by}} numerous political figures and sultans from Batavia, Semarang, Yogyakarta, and Surakarta, as well as clergy from Malang and Lampung; Soegijapranata's first act as vicar was to issue a pastoral letter with Willekens that outlined the historical background {{that led to his}} appointment, including Pope BenedictXV's apolistic letter Maximum Illud, which called for more local clergy, and Pope PiusXI and Pope PiusXII's efforts to appoint more pastors and bishops <b>from</b> <b>native</b> ethnic groups worldwide.

5|$|Sparked by the 1848 Whitman Massacre, {{a number}} of violent battles were fought between American {{settlers}} and the region's natives. The subsequent Indian Wars, especially the Yakima War, decimated the native population and removed much land <b>from</b> <b>native</b> control. As years progressed, the right of natives to fish along the Columbia became the central issue of contention with the states, commercial fishers, and private property owners. The US Supreme Court upheld fishing rights in landmark cases in 1905 and 1918, {{as well as the}} 1974 case United States v. Washington, commonly called the Boldt Decision.|$|E
5|$|Strafford's {{fall from}} power {{weakened}} Charles's influence in Ireland. The {{dissolution of the}} Irish army was unsuccessfully demanded three times by the English Commons during Strafford's imprisonment, until Charles was eventually forced through lack of money to disband the army {{at the end of}} Strafford's trial. Disputes concerning the transfer of land ownership <b>from</b> <b>native</b> Catholic to settler Protestant, particularly in relation to the plantation of Ulster, coupled with resentment at moves to ensure the Irish Parliament was subordinate to the Parliament of England, sowed the seeds of rebellion. When armed conflict arose between the Gaelic Irish and New English, in late October 1641, the Old English sided with the Gaelic Irish while simultaneously professing their loyalty to the king.|$|E
5|$|The Marwari is descended <b>from</b> <b>native</b> Indian ponies crossed with Arabian horses. The ponies {{were small}} and hardy, but with poor conformation; the {{influence}} of the Arabian blood improved the appearance without compromising the hardiness. The Arabians possibly came ashore from a cargo ship wrecked off India's west coast. Legend in India states that the Arabian ship, containing seven Arabian horses of good breeding, was shipwrecked off the shore of the Kachchh District. These horses were then taken to the Marwar district and used as foundation bloodstock for the Marwari. There is also the possibility of some Mongolian influence from the north. The breed probably originated in northwest India on the Afghanistan border, as well as in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, and takes its name from the Marwar region (also called the Jodhpur region) of India.|$|E
