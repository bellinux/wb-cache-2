5|$|A star remains {{near its}} initial {{position}} on the main sequence until {{a significant amount of}} hydrogen in the core has been consumed, then begins to evolve <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> luminous star. (On the HR diagram, the evolving star moves up and {{to the right of the}} main sequence.) Thus the main sequence represents the primary hydrogen-burning stage of a star's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|As the eruptions continued, {{they became}} {{concentrated}} at one vent along the fissure {{and began to}} build the island <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> circular shape. By 24 November, the island measured about 900metres by 650metres (2950 by 2130ft). The violent explosions caused by the meeting of lava and sea water meant that the island consisted of a loose pile of volcanic rock (scoria), which was eroded rapidly by North Atlantic storms during the winter. However, eruptions more than kept pace with wave erosion, and by February 1964, the island had a maximum diameter of over 1300metres (4265ft).|$|E
5|$|During post-production, as the {{producers}} {{decided to change}} the film <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> serious horror film, they filmed numerous scenes for that purpose without {{the participation of the}} director. Among those scenes is the entire prologue of the astronauts in space and West waking up in a hospital--these are the only scenes in which Rebar's face is seen without makeup. Additionally, the film was extensively re-edited by {{the producers}}. Sachs criticized the acting in those re-shot scenes, as well as the change of tone they bring into the film along with the re-editing by the producers.|$|E

5|$|French {{breeding}} of the Mérens is divided between two schools of thought. The first is traditional breeders seeking {{to preserve the}} original type, that of a light draft horse living high in the mountains year-round and retaining the hardiness for which the breed is known. The second comes from {{the conversion of the}} Mérens to a leisure horse in the 1980s, and aims to transform the physical type of the breed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> sports-oriented horse to ensure the survival of the breed. This dichotomy has become a source of tension between farmers and users of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Fuller, however, was {{confident}} {{in his work}} {{and the idea that}} the film would be strongly anti-racist, particularly with the changes he had made to the original work. The original novel's hate-filled Muslim black trainer, who had deliberately retrained the dog to attack white people, was converted into the character of Keys, who genuinely wished to cure the animal. Fuller also changed the novel's original ending <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> pessimistic film ending. The film was shot in only forty-five days at a cost of $7 million. Five white German Shepherd Dogs played the unnamed central character.|$|E
5|$|García Márquez {{was also}} noted for leaving out {{seemingly}} important details and events so {{the reader is}} forced <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> participatory role in the story development. For example, in No One Writes to the Colonel, the main characters are not given names. This practice is influenced by Greek tragedies, such as Antigone and Oedipus Rex, in which important events occur off-stage and are left to the audience's imagination.|$|E

5|$|In the Georgian era, Norwich {{became an}} {{increasingly}} popular destination with travellers and {{developed into a}} fashionable shopping town. Buildings around the market were developed into luxury shops and coaching inns. The {{eastern side of the}} market was particularly fashionable and became known as Gentleman's Walk. The area around the market had become very congested by the 19thcentury, but the council was unable to raise funds for improvement and few alterations were made. Because many of the market's stalls were privately owned, the council was unable to rearrange the market <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> rational layout.|$|E

5|$|Many {{emerging}} {{nations of}} Asia, Africa, and Latin America rejected {{the pressure to}} choose sides in the East-West competition. In 1955, at the Bandung Conference in Indonesia, dozens of Third World governments resolved {{to stay out of}} the Cold War. The consensus reached at Bandung culminated with the creation of the Belgrade-headquartered Non-Aligned Movement in 1961. Meanwhile, Khrushchev broadened Moscow's policy to establish ties with India and other key neutral states. Independence movements in the Third World transformed the post-war order <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> pluralistic world of decolonized African and Middle Eastern nations and of rising nationalism in Asia and Latin America.|$|E
5|$|Mountfort's early Gothic work in New Zealand was of {{the more}} severe Anglican variety as practised by Carpenter, with tall lancet windows and many gables. As his career progressed, and he had proved himself to the {{employing}} authorities, his designs developed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> European form, with towers, turrets and high ornamental roof lines in the French manner, a style which {{was in no way}} peculiar to Mountfort but was endorsed by such architects as Alfred Waterhouse in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Royal {{government}} in England had traditionally centred on several great offices of state, filled by powerful, independent {{members of the}} baronage. Henry abandoned this policy, leaving the post of justiciar vacant and turning the position of chancellor <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> junior role. A small royal council was formed but its role was ill-defined; appointments, patronage, and policy were decided personally by Henry and his immediate advisers, rather than through the larger councils that had marked his early years. The changes made it much harder for those outside Henry's inner circle to influence policy or to pursue legitimate grievances, particularly against the King's friends.|$|E

5|$|Sigismund II's childlessness added {{urgency to}} the idea of turning the {{personal}} union between Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> permanent and tighter relationship; it was also a priority for the execution movement. Lithuania's laws were codified and reforms enacted in 1529, 1557, 1565–1566 and 1588, gradually making its social, legal and economic system similar to that of Poland, with the expanding role of the middle and lower nobility. Fighting wars with Moscow under Ivan IV and the threat perceived from that direction provided additional motivation for the real union for both Poland and Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|The Hot Rock is {{the fourth}} studio album by the American rock band Sleater-Kinney, {{released}} on February 23, 1999,by Kill Rock Stars. It was produced by Roger Moutenot and recorded at Avast studio in Seattle, Washington in July 1998. The Hot Rock marks a considerable change in the band's sound, veering <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> relaxed and gloomy direction than the raucous punk rock style of its predecessors. The lyrical themes of the album explore issues of failed relationships and personal uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Song dynasty (960–1279) was noted for its towering Buddhist pagodas, enormous stone and wooden bridges, lavish tombs, and extravagant palaces. Although literary works on architecture existed beforehand, architectural writing blossomed during the Song dynasty, maturing <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> professional form that described dimensions and working materials in a concise, organized manner. In addition to the examples still standing, depictions in Song artwork, architectural drawings, and illustrations in published books all aid modern historians in understanding the {{architecture of}} the period.|$|E
