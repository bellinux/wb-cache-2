Then in 1950, Smith became the Director of Central Intelligence, {{the head of the}} Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other {{intelligence}} agencies in the United States. Smith reorganized the CIA, redefined its structure and its mission, and he gave <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> sense of purpose. He made the CIA the arm of government primarily responsible for covert operations. He left the CIA in 1953 to become an Under Secretary of State. After retiring from the State Department in 1954, Smith continued to serve the Eisenhower Administration in various posts for several years, until his retirement and his death in 1961.|$|E

The nine-story Palm Tower was completed, the lagoon-style pool was added, and notable changes {{were made to the}} Grand Lobby Atrium, Starlight Lounge, Villas Del Lago, and new golf shop and country club.

5|$|The Ten reissue sold 60,000 {{copies in}} its first week, the second biggest selling week for the album since Christmas 1993. Since Billboard {{considers}} the Ten reissue a catalog item, Ten did not appear on the Billboard 200, Top Modern Rock/Alternative, or Top Rock Albums, since those charts do not include catalog items. Had it been included on the Billboard 200, the 60,000 copies sold of the Ten reissue would have placed it at number five. The reissue also re-entered the Australian Albums Chart at number 11, giving <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> peak chart position in Australia and its highest chart placing since June 14, 1992.|$|E
5|$|The canal {{company went}} {{bankrupt}} and {{was bought by}} the state in 1886. This briefly gave <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> lease of life, but the canal had an obsolete gauge. By {{the start of the}} 20th century it was almost abandoned. The canal was neglected and parts were filled in. In the 1970s the A47 autoroute between Givors and Saint-Étienne covered almost all the sections that remained, apart from the site at Tartaras where the double lock and tunnel have been preserved as a heritage site.|$|E
5|$|The {{new line}} was planned as a through route {{and was not}} {{intended}} to have any stations of its own, but in 1904 it was decided to build two stations on <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> <b>new</b> station, also named Wotton, was built immediately to the south of the existing Wotton station. On 2 April 1906 the new route opened to passengers. The two Wotton stations were very close together, and the same stationmaster was responsible for both.|$|E

5|$|The tercentenary of {{the capture}} of Gibraltar was celebrated in the {{territory}} in August 2004 but attracted criticism from some in Spain. In September 2006, tripartite talks between Spain, Gibraltar and the UK resulted in a deal (known as the Cordoba Agreement) {{to make it easier}} to cross the border and to improve transport and communications links between Spain and Gibraltar. Among the changes was an agreement to lift restrictions on Gibraltar's airport to enable airlines operating from Spain to land there and to facilitate use of the airport by Spanish residents. It did not address the vexed issue of sovereignty, but this time the government of Gibraltar supported <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> <b>new</b> Constitution Order was promulgated in the same year, which was approved by a majority of 60.24% in a referendum held in November 2006.|$|E
5|$|While Cope and Marsh dueled for fossils in the American West, {{they also}} tried {{their best to}} ruin each other's {{professional}} credibility. Humiliated by his error in reconstructing the plesiosaur Elasmosaurus, Cope tried to cover up his mistake by purchasing every copy he could find of the journal {{in which it was}} published. Marsh, meanwhile, made sure to publicize the story. Cope's own rapid and prodigious output of scientific papers meant that Marsh had no difficulty in finding occasional errors with which to lambast Cope. Marsh himself was not infallible; he put the wrong skull on a skeleton of Apatosaurus and declared <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> genus, Brontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{contained}} suggestive dialogue {{and the female}} cast wore revealing clothes, the production was considered highly risqué at the time. The script alluded to a contemporary scandal involving actor Fatty Arbuckle, and one scene featured actresses stripping {{as part of a}} card game. Reviewers generally panned the play as unfunny and vulgar, and local authorities attempted to censor <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> <b>New</b> York City magistrate ruled the Broadway production was obscene, and obscenity charges were brought against Woods, but a grand jury declined to indict him. The city's Commissioner of Licenses attempted to revoke the theater's license, but this effort was blocked in court. Woods promoted the controversy to increase ticket sales, and the play {{was one of the most}} successful of the season. It had no long-term literary impact and was never published, but it did stimulate arguments over censorship of theatrical performances.|$|E

5|$|The {{establishment}} of the Council in Ludlow Castle gave <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> lease of life, during {{a period in which}} many similar fortifications were falling into decay. By the 1530s, the castle needed considerable renovation; Lee began work in 1534, borrowing money to do so, but Sir Thomas Engleford complained the following year that the castle was still unfit for habitation. Lee repaired the castle roofs, probably using lead from the Carmelite friary in the town, and using the fines imposed and the goods confiscated by the court. He later claimed that the work on the castle would have cost around £500, had the Crown had to pay for it all directly. The porter's lodge and prison were built in the outer bailey around 1552. The woods around the castle were gradually cut down during the 16th century.|$|E

25|$|By a Charter of Elizabeth I in 1589 {{the bailiff}} was {{replaced}} by a mayor, by which time the town's importance was dwindling.
