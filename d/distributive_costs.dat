40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} conflict that combines popular support and asymmetric fighting technologies {{in a civil war}} setting. Starting with different endowments, two parties must decide on the amount of resources to divert from production to fighting. The conditions for conflict to arise are derived and civil war is shown to be subject to efficiency and <b>distributive</b> <b>costs.</b> Two other equilibria can occur, the first involving only one side choosing to arm, and the other a peace equilibrium where both groups choose zero fighting effort. The model is consistent with various historical accounts of the different roads to war and with recent empirical evidence on the determinants of conflict. Although the model focuses on civil wars, it can easily be extended to other situations that involve conflict such as rent seeking, political campaigning or litigation. ...|$|E

For example, {{there are more}} than 100 federal programs for surface transportation, 82 programs to ensure teacher quality, 80 programs to promote domestic economic development, and 47 programs to provide employment and job-training services. Recent high-profile legislation–-such as the financial-industry reform measure and the health-care reform measure–-add new programs without repealing existing ones directed at the same policy goals. Prior academic analyses generally have not considered why Congress pursues redundancy. This article addresses that question through both theoretical and institutional analysis. The article first constructs an organizational theory that attributes redundancy in administrative programs to the congressional committee system. Specifically, the article demonstrates that two critical components of the existing committee system-–fragmented jurisdictions and parliamentary prerogatives–-systematically bias legislative outcomes in favor of redundancy. Building on leading theoretical accounts of congressional committees from political science, the article then presents a novel cost-benefit analysis of this tendency toward redundancy. It shows that redundancy allows legislators to increase distributive favors for constituents and interest groups but that redundancy is also linked to the desirable pursuit of informational efficiency. Thus, the institutional structures facilitating redundancy have mixed effects. Consequently, the article describes and analyzes specific institutional reforms that trade off the <b>distributive</b> <b>costs</b> and the informational benefits associated with redundancy. One approach would subject more legislative decisions to external advisory processes such as that used to close unneeded military facilities. A second and more promising approach would preserve existing committee jurisdictions but would scale back committees’ parliamentary prerogatives, thereby encouraging redundancy in program design but discouraging redundancy in program implementation...|$|E

This has resulted in a series of simultaneous negative effects on the region's economies: declining exports (in terms of both volume and price), severe limitations on access to capital markets, a decrease in remittances and a reduction in the flow of foreign direct investment. These factors affect public finances, while at the same time limiting governments' ability to respond. Tax revenues are declining significantly as a result of the economic slowdown/recession and the drop in commodity prices. Moreover, the fiscal stimulus packages implemented by the countries will cause a further decline in their fiscal balances. To compensate for the <b>distributive</b> <b>costs</b> of the crisis, the countries have adopted contingency measures. Finally, in tandem with shrinking fiscal balances, the flow of external financing has slowed significantly. This worsening in fiscal performance comes on the heels of several years of improved performance in the region's public accounts, which had allowed for a lowering of the debt-to-GDP ratio. The seriousness of the worsening fiscal situation, along with the possibility that it could lead to solvency problems, is closely linked to the pre-crisis fiscal position, and will be affected by how long the crisis lasts. The crisis and its impacts vary from country to country, demanding different responses, due both to differences in the causes and effects, and to countries' differing capacities and resources. This document focuses in particular on the impact of the crisis on tax revenues, and on the countries' policy responses to the crisis. It also examines potential lines of action that countries could undertake. The present report approaches this situation by analysing tax issues and examining how they interact with the current economic situation. It begins by presenting an assessment of the principal stylised features of the changing fiscal and tax policy of the last several years. It then looks at the possible impact of the crisis on this situation, and the level of risk to which each country is exposed. Following this, it examines the main fiscal and tax measures adopted, as well as issues of political economy that could hinder the implementation of reforms to address the crisis. Finally, it presents some thoughts on which paths would be most advantageous over the coming years...|$|E

The <b>distributive</b> property (<b>cost</b> to resist the locally dominant choice) alone is not a network effect, for lack of any positive feedback, however the addition of bistability per individual, such as by a switching cost, qualifies as a network effect, by distributing this instability to the collective as a whole.|$|R
40|$|Given their {{inherently}} diverse {{composition and}} potentially competing interests, a foundational activity of community health alliances is establishing {{consensus on the}} vision and strategies for achieving its goals. Using an organizational justice framework, we examined whether member perceptions of fairness in alliances' decision‐making processes {{are associated with the}} perceived level of consensus among members regarding the alliance vision and strategies. We used a mixed‐methods design {{to examine the relationship between}} perceptions of fairness and consensus within fourteen multisector community health alliances. Quantitative analysis found the perceived level of consensus to be positively associated with decision‐making transparency (procedural fairness), inclusiveness (procedural fairness), and benefits relative to <b>costs</b> (<b>distributive</b> fairness). Qualitative analysis indicated that the consensus‐building process is facilitated by using formal decision‐making frameworks and engaging alliance members in decision‐making processes early. Alliance leaders may be more successful at building consensus when they recognize the need to appeal to a member's sense of procedural and distributive fairness, and, perhaps equally important, recognize when one rather than the other is called for and draw upon decision‐making processes that most clearly evoke that sense of fairness. Our findings reinforce the importance of fairness in building and sustaining capacity for improving community health...|$|R
40|$|A {{majority}} of East African nations {{rely heavily on}} hydropower for their energy supply. Climate change experts predict significant changes to total precipitation and seasonal weather patterns in this area in the near future. Consequently, these nations should expect hydrologic stress across all watershed scales. Resilience of East Africa’s energy sector to these climate change impacts will rely on coordinated environmental and economic policy. It {{will depend on the}} ability of governments to quickly improve management of important ecosystems and water basins. However, effective decision-making must balance the watershed needs of local livelihoods, such as subsistence agriculture, with national energy needs, such as expansion of electricity infrastructure. Environmental policy increasingly leans to economic mechanisms to find resolutions to ecosystem dependency conflicts. Payments for Ecosystems Services (PES) is one environmental economic mechanism that could effectively and rapidly improve environmental management in this region. This paper investigates the feasibility for using local PES schemes in a major Rwanda watershed as both a tool for community vulnerability reduction and for energy sector resilience to climate change impacts. Payments for Ecosystem Services in developing countries involves local-level environmental negotiations between the public and private sectors. The mechanism has two goals. Primarily, it gives physical value to specific resource improvements. Secondly, PES reorganizes funding streams towards particular environmental objectives using positive incentives. In effect, it can develop a sustainable, locally-driven, conservation funding mechanism. PES most strongly emerged as a conservation tool in the early 1990 ’s in Latin America. Uncertainty in its ability to achieve restoration targets and questions about its ability to achieve financial independence does not deter PES’ popularity. PES schemes and informational networks now exist in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. The first portion of this paper looks at the capacity-building potential of PES mechanisms. It relates these to adaptive capacity needs for climate change given by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The second portion of this paper organizes key literature describing different feasibility criteria for PES implementation in the Rwandan context. To verify whether watershed PES is plausible, the paper then investigates the political, social, and environmental context of Rwanda’s major watershed and compares these to fourteen international PES case study sites. The final portion of the paper links potential PES scheme designs in the Rugezi area to specific capacity building potential and then to climate change adaptation objectives. Successful implementation of watershed PES in Rwanda will depend on careful scheme design and persistent trust-building in order to harmonize wetland inhabitant and electric utility needs. Existence of contextually parallel projects in Indonesia, South Africa, and Columbia, gives evidence that these challenges can be creatively overcome. Findings show that Rwandan decision-makers will need more hydrologic data to make ecologically informed and efficient decisions and also to set targets. With several necessary conditions in place, watershed PES in Rugezi may be a feasible tool for climate change adaptation and energy sector resilience. However, there is need for cost-benefit analysis to clarify short term, long term, and <b>distributive</b> <b>costs</b> and benefits of such a project...|$|E
40|$|The paper aims at {{analyzing}} {{the differences in}} the level of Russian regions social well-being in 2004 – 2014. The objectives of the research are the assessment of the regional social well-being; evaluation of the interregional inequality and the degree of regions convergence/divergence in social well-being; estimation of the factors contributed to it. The social well-being is presented as a four-factor multiplicative model, based on the A. Sen extended function, which includes GDP per capita, share of personal incomes in GRP, cost of living index in the region and intra-regional income inequality. We evaluate the degree of interregional inequality in social well-being on the basis of generalized entropy indices (Theil index and Theil-Bernoulli index). The authors determined a contribution of factors to the interregional inequality according to the Duro-Esteban inequality decomposition technique. According to our hypothesis, the interregional differences decrease as we go from GRP per capita towards nominal and real income and social well-being of regions due to three compensation effects: <b>distributive</b> one, <b>cost</b> of living and intraregional inequality. The dynamics of these effects defines the character and extent of convergence. As a result of the research, we constructed the map of Russian Federation regions by social well-being, and discovered interregional differences in dynamics. Weighted entropy indices allowed to reveal the turning point in the tendency of the accelerated convergence of the Russian regions in 2009, and according to the unweighted entropy indices, there is a smooth turn to divergence in 2011. We determined the contribution of four factors and three crossings of the model in the formation of interregional differences by social well-being in statics. In dynamics, we revealed the positive impact on the convergence by production and distribution factors and the negative impact on it by the factors of cost of life and intraregional inequality. The obtained results are applicable to the assessment of the effectiveness of the regional policy and interbudgetary equalization and {{to the development of the}} measures to improve it...|$|R
