[...] The book relates the events of those five and a half years, as an adult Sylvia recalled them years later. [...] The title derives from the yellow badge that Syvia was forced to wear.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to her {{time on the}} North Atlantic, Kroonland encountered few weather or mechanical delays on the coast-to-coast route. In December 1923, however, the ship was delayed one day by unusually heavy seas and gales off Baja California. Another delay in October 1924 proved to be fatal, according to the ship's physician. An arrival two days late, caused by adverse currents north of Panama, cost a female passenger <b>her</b> <b>life.</b> <b>Had</b> the ship not been delayed, the physician believed, prompt hospital care could have saved her.

She subsequently had to be on rest for the next six months. The singer later told Attitude magazine that she had a serious marijuana addiction during that time in order to bear the pain of the surgery. [...] "I would break the habit and it would sneak back in, and I would break it and sneak back in," [...] Gaga confessed, adding that <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> become a smoke-filled cycle: sleep, sing, smoke.

500|$|On 5 January 1589, Catherine {{died at the}} age of sixty-nine, {{probably}} from pleurisy. L'Estoile wrote: [...] "those close to her believed that <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> been shortened by displeasure over her son's deed." [...] He added that she had no sooner died than she was treated with as much consideration as a dead goat. Because Paris was held by enemies of the crown, Catherine had to be buried provisionally at Blois. Eight months later, Jacques Clément stabbed Henry III to death. At the time, Henry was besieging Paris with the King of Navarre, who would succeed him as Henry IV of France. Henry III's assassination ended nearly three centuries of Valois rule and brought the Bourbon dynasty into power. Years later, Diane, daughter of Henry II and Philippa Duci, had Catherine's remains reinterred in the Saint-Denis basilica in Paris. In 1793, a revolutionary mob tossed her bones into a mass grave with those of the other kings and queens.|$|E

[...] Cynthia later complained that the film made her out [...] "as a clingy, dim, little girlfriend in a headscarf". [...] She was portrayed in 2000 television film [...] by Gillian Kearney; the negative aspects of John's treatment towards her were not overlooked. [...] Cynthia was subsequently portrayed in the troubled, Ono-centric 2005 American musical Lennon, with her character – played by Julia Murney – gaining a little more prominence during one of the show's rewrites. [...] <b>Her</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> a more central role in the 2010 BBC Four film Lennon Naked, with Claudie Blakley playing the part.

2500|$|Aqil al-Turehi {{said that}} he [...] "feel furious when I think that this gang of Jim McCormick and the Iraqis working with him killed my people by {{creating}} false security and selling such a useless device". In one incident, a vehicle carrying rockets and missiles travelled undetected through 23 Baghdad checkpoints equipped with the ADE 651. The {{false sense of security}} provided by the device had catastrophic effects for many Iraqi people, hundreds of whom were killed in bombings that the ADE 651 failed to prevent. The victim of one such bombing, 21-year-old Haneen Alwan, told the BBC that <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> been destroyed after she was caught in a bomb attack which caused injuries that killed her unborn child and prompted her husband to divorce her because of her extensive burns, which have so far required her to undergo 59 operations. She said: [...] "When people passed through checkpoints using these devices, they thought they would be safe. But they are useless. The man who sold them has no conscience. He is morally bankrupt. How could he sell them just for money and destroy other people's lives?" ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1925, Parnok and Tsuberbiller {{had become}} the closest of friends, and when Erarskaya was hospitalized for a mental break, Tsuberbiller {{was the one to}} whom she turned to regain her peace of mind. Parnok was distressed, feeling that <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> ended, and was unable to work because of her {{depression}} and worry over her lover. Erarskaya's paranoia and violent outbursts, led to unsettling trauma for Parnok, causing several fainting spells. In 1926, Parnok moved in with Tsuberbiller on Neopalimovsky Lane at Smolensky Boulevard. After a year in the sanatorium Erarskaya was finally pronounced well and released. Increasingly Parnok felt isolated from her readers and alienated from her peers, in part because by 1926, GLAVLIT's authority had been extended to cover both public and private publishing. Parnok feared that her cycle Music would not be accepted for publication. The censorship of her works, but also the unspoken censorship of herself, made her feel invisible, inspiring her poems such as Prologue (1928). She joined another group of poets, known as [...] "The Knot" [...] which was founded to publish the works of the members to secure that one of the group's first releases was the publishing of Music. The censors allowed [...] "The Knot" [...] to exists because their publication runs were limited to 700 copies or less.|$|E
