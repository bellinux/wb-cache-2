5|$|Figs have an obligate {{mutualism}} with <b>fig</b> wasps, (Agaonidae); figs {{are only}} pollinated by <b>fig</b> wasps, and <b>fig</b> wasps can only reproduce in <b>fig</b> flowers. Generally, each <b>fig</b> species {{depends on a}} single species of wasp for pollination. The wasps are similarly dependent on their <b>fig</b> species in order to reproduce. Ficus aurea is pollinated by Pegoscapus mexicanus (Ashmead).|$|E

5|$|The Ficus genus is {{composed}} of 800 species of vines, shrubs, and trees, including the cultivated <b>fig,</b> defined by their syconiums, the fruit-like vessels that either hold female flowers or pollen on the inside.

5|$|Ficus aurea, {{commonly}} known as the Florida strangler <b>fig</b> (or simply strangler <b>fig),</b> golden <b>fig,</b> or higuerón, is a tree in the family Moraceae that is native to the U.S. state of Florida, the northern and western Caribbean, southern Mexico and Central America south to Panama. The specific epithet aurea was applied by English botanist Thomas Nuttall who described the species in 1846.|$|E
5|$|In 1847–8 {{several of}} the old houses {{associated}} with the cathedral {{on the west side}} were demolished, and some minor changes were made to the boundary wall. Structural reinforcement of the ruin and some reconstruction work began in the early 20th century, including restoration of the east gable rose window in 1904 and the replacement of the missing form pieces, mullions, and decorative ribs in the window in the north-east wall of the chapterhouse (<b>Fig.</b> 15). By 1913, repointing the walls and additional waterproofing of the wall tops were completed. In 1924 the ground level was lowered and the 17th-century tomb of the Earl of Huntly was repositioned. Further repairs and restoration ensued during the 1930s, including the partial dismantling of some 19th century buttressing (<b>Fig.</b> 16), the reconstruction of sections of the nave piers using recovered pieces (<b>Fig.</b> 17), and the addition of external roofing to the vault in the south choir in 1939 (<b>Fig.</b> 18). From 1960 to 2000, masons restored the cathedral's crumbling stonework (<b>Fig.</b> 19) and between 1976 and 1988, the window tracery of the chapterhouse was gradually replaced, and its re-roofing was completed (<b>Fig.</b> 20). Floors, glazing, and a new roof were added to the south-west tower between 1988 and 1998 and comparable restoration work was completed on the north-west tower between 1998 and 2000 (<b>Fig.</b> 21).|$|E

5|$|Wasps are {{a diverse}} group, {{estimated}} at {{over a hundred}} thousand described species around the world, and a great many more as yet undescribed. For example, there are over 800 species of <b>fig</b> trees, mostly in the tropics, {{and almost all of}} these has its own specific <b>fig</b> wasp (Chalcidoidea) to effect pollination.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other Ficus species, the {{community}} of wasps inside the figs of F. rubiginosa is made up mostly of pollinator wasps. These develop deep inside the syconium, presumably protected there from parasites. Also present are much smaller numbers of other wasp species, which do not pollinate the <b>fig.</b> At least fourteen species have been recorded, of which four—two each belonging to the genera Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis—are common while others are rare. Investigation of F. rubiginosa syconia found that the <b>fig</b> seeds and parasitic wasps develop closer {{to the wall of}} the syconium. The wasps of the genera Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis are parasitic and are around {{the same size as the}} pollinator species. Their larvae are thought to feed on the larvae of the pollinator wasp. Male Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis wasps fight other males of the same species when they encounter each other in a F. rubiginosa <b>fig.</b> Several genera of uncommon larger wasp species enter the immature figs before other wasps and induce galls, which may impact on numbers of pollinator wasps in the <b>fig</b> later. An example of this is Pseudidarnes minerva, a metallic green wasp species.|$|E
