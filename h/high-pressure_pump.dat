50|$|These {{advances}} in seal technology, plus {{the rise of}} plastics in the post-war years, {{led to the development}} of the first reliable <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pump.</b> The invention of Marlex by Robert Banks and John Paul Hogan of the Phillips Petroleum company required a catalyst to be injected into the polyethylene. McCartney Manufacturing Company in Baxter Springs, Kansas, began manufacturing these high-pressure pumps in 1960 for the polyethylene industry. Flow Industries in Kent, Washington set the groundwork for commercial viability of waterjets with John Olsen’s development of the high-pressure fluid intensifier in 1973, a design that was further refined in 1976. Flow Industries then combined the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pump</b> research with their waterjet nozzle research and brought waterjet cutting into the manufacturing world.|$|E

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to hydrogen's issues of damage and danger involved in high-impact crashes, air, on its own, is non-flammable, {{it was reported}} on Seven Network's Beyond Tomorrow that on its own carbon-fiber is [...] and can split under sufficient stress, but creates no shrapnel when it does so. Carbon-fiber tanks safely hold air at a pressure somewhere around 4500 psi, making them comparable to steel tanks. The cars {{are designed to be}} filled up at a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{common rail}} systems, a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pump</b> stores a {{reservoir}} of fuel at high pressure — up to and above [...] The term [...] "common rail" [...] refers {{to the fact that}} all of the fuel injectors are supplied by a common fuel rail which {{is nothing more than a}} pressure accumulator where the fuel is stored at high pressure. This accumulator supplies multiple fuel injectors with high-pressure fuel. This simplifies the purpose of the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pump</b> in that it only needs to maintain a commanded pressure at a target (either mechanically or electronically controlled). The fuel injectors are typically ECU-controlled. When the fuel injectors are electrically activated, a hydraulic valve (consisting of a nozzle and plunger) is mechanically or hydraulically opened and fuel is sprayed into the cylinders at the desired pressure. Since the fuel pressure energy is stored remotely and the injectors are electrically actuated, the injection pressure at the start and end of injection is very near the pressure in the accumulator (rail), thus producing a square injection rate. If the accumulator, pump and plumbing are sized properly, the injection pressure and rate will be the same for each of the multiple injection events.|$|E
50|$|Operation - Water mist {{systems can}} operate {{with the same}} {{functionality}} as deluge, wet pipe, dry pipe, or pre-action systems. The difference is that a water mist system uses a compressed gas as an atomizing medium, which is pumped through the sprinkler pipe. Instead of compressed gas, some systems use a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pump</b> to pressurize the water so it atomizes as it exits the sprinkler nozzle. Systems can be applied using local application method or total flooding method, similar to Clean Agent Fire Protection Systems.|$|E
50|$|Reverse osmosis {{process for}} water {{purification}} {{does not require}} thermal energy. Flow-through reverse osmosis systems can be regulated by <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pumps.</b> The recovery of purified water depends upon various factors, including membrane sizes, membrane pore size, temperature, operating pressure, and membrane surface area.|$|R

5000|$|Mr. Oklejas left to co-found Pump Engineering, Inc. {{where he}} served as {{president}} and he led the effort to develop turbochargers for RO applications until his departure in 1996. FEDCO was founded in 1997 as a partnership between Osmonics, Inc. and Eli Oklejas. FEDCO’s goal was to develop innovative <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pumps</b> and energy recovery devices.|$|R
50|$|Nearly all {{reverse osmosis}} plants {{operated}} for the desalination of sea water {{in order to}} produce drinking water inindustrial scale are equipped with an energy recovery system based on turbines. These are activated by the concentrate (brine) leaving the plant and transfer the energy contained in the high pressure of this concentrate usually mechanically to the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pump.</b> In the pressure exchanger the energy contained in the brine is transferred hydraulically and with an efficiency of approximately 98% to the feed. This reduces the energy demand for the desalination process significantly and thus the operating costs. Therefrom results an economic energy recovery, amortization times for such systems varying between 2 and 4 years depending on the place of operation.|$|E
50|$|Autofrettage is a metal {{fabrication}} technique {{in which a}} pressure vessel is subjected to enormous pressure, causing internal portions of the part to yield plastically, resulting in internal compressive residual stresses once the pressure is released. The goal of autofrettage {{is to increase the}} durability of the final product. Inducing residual compressive stresses into materials can also increase their resistance to stress corrosion cracking; that is, non-mechanically-assisted cracking that occurs when a material is placed in a corrosive environment in the presence of tensile stress. The technique is commonly used in manufacture of <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pump</b> cylinders, warship and tank gun barrels, and fuel injection systems for diesel engines. While autofrettage will induce some work hardening, that is not the primary mechanism of strengthening.|$|E
5000|$|In CIJ technology, a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pump</b> directs {{liquid ink}} from a {{reservoir}} through a gunbody and a microscopic nozzle, creating a continuous stream of ink droplets via the Plateau-Rayleigh instability. A piezoelectric crystal creates an acoustic wave as it vibrates within the gunbody and causes {{the stream of}} liquid to break into droplets at regular intervals: 64,000 to 165,000 droplets per second may be achieved. The ink droplets are subjected to an electrostatic field created by a charging electrode as they form; the field varies according {{to the degree of}} drop deflection desired. This results in a controlled, variable electrostatic charge on each droplet. Charged droplets are separated by one or more uncharged [...] "guard droplets" [...] to minimize electrostatic repulsion between neighbouring droplets.|$|E

50|$|Both engines {{featured}} piston skirts {{coated with}} a teflon-based friction-reducing material, and fitted with low-tension, low oil consumption rings. In addition, a new fail-safe cooling mode provided protection even {{in the case of}} a catastrophic coolant loss (such as a punctured radiator). In the event of coolant loss, the engine control unit shuts off fuel to alternate cylinders to reduce the risk of engine damage from overheating. The valves continue to operate, in order to pump cooling air through the cylinders. The cooling system was designed to maintain an ideal engine temperature even when subjected to a prolonged 15 percent gradient in 46 °C (115 °F) weather. A returnless fuel supply system helped to reduce evaporative emissions by providing consistent pressure to the fuel injectors through a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|E

It used a mid/rear-mounted Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection V8, shared with the 308 GTBi/GTSi, mounted transversely. The engine used in the 1973 Dino 308 GT4. The K-Jetronic system is mechanical, with a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pump</b> which streams fuel continuously to the injectors; {{it does not have}} a computer, just a few relays to handle the cold start sequence etc.The chassis was also based on the 308 GT4, but with a 100 mm wheelbase at 2650 mm.

A dashboard-mounted override control was fitted to allow the rear suspension to be locked in normal ride height when parked, so the car did not drop in response to loading and unloading. It automatically released when the clutch was operated when driving off. A fan-belt driven <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pump</b> was added and an under-bonnet reservoir to hold the [...] "LHS" [...] hydraulic fluid.

5000|$|The D.II {{was based}} on the Austro-Daimler to a large degree. Like the Austro-Daimler, it was built up from the crankcase, which was milled from two pieces of cast {{aluminum}} bolted together at their midline. The cylinders were separately milled from steel and bolted {{to the top of the}} crankcase. Steel sleeves were fitted over the cylinders and welded on to form a cooling jacket. Much of this complexity is due to the differential rates of expansion of steel and aluminum, which precluded screwing the cylinders into the crankcase, and the alloys of the era meant that an aluminum cylinder was not possible. Both engines also used a scavenger pump to pump oil out of the crankcase to a separate cylinder, where a second <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pump</b> supplied oil to the engine. This arrangement allowed for a much smaller [...] "sump" [...] on the bottom of the crankcase, reducing the overall size of the engine, although in the case of the D.II it was not nearly as much as the Austro-Daimler.|$|E
40|$|Energy {{requirements}} in desalination plants can be supplied by coupling desalination units with nuclear reactors. Multistage flash (MSF) plants often use low-pressure steam as an energy source. The energy consumption in MSF plant {{depends on the}} distillate flow rate and the plant performance ratio. Reverse osmosis (RO) plants are operated by electrical power to derive the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pumps</b> and other plant auxiliaries, mainly the pretreatment processes. RO power consumption depends mainly on water recovery and the working pressure. Low pressure and temperature steam extracted from nuclear heating reactors (NHR) {{may be used for}} supplying the necessary energy to derive the MSF units. Electricity can be generated from the nuclear power reactor (NPR) to derive the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pumps</b> of the RO desalination plants. Coupling RO and MSF with nuclear steam supply system (NSSS) will yield some economical and technical advantages. The hybrid RO MSF system has potential advantages of a low power demand, improved water quality and possible lower running cost as compared to stand-alone RO or MSF plants. Developing the most appropriate plant configuration of nuclear reactor and desalination process is an important task that will determine the feasibility of nuclear desalination. The optimum coupling of hybrid RO MSF desalination processes with nuclear power plant will be presented in this paper...|$|R
