5|$|Although {{there were}} several short spells when a third {{division}} was created, the two-division structure remained largely in place until 1975, when a major re-organisation of the league led to a new three-tier set-up {{and the creation of}} a new Premier Division at the <b>highest</b> <b>level.</b> In 1998, the teams then in the Premier Division broke away to form the SPL, which supplanted the Premier Division as the <b>highest</b> <b>level</b> of football in Scotland. The SPL and SFL merged in 2013 to form the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL), which branded its top division as the Scottish Premiership.|$|E
5|$|From 189697 until 191920, the Football League and Southern League ran in parallel, {{and were}} {{organised}} by separate bodies. The Southern League was therefore {{not part of}} the English football league pyramid. In 192021, the Southern League First Division was absorbed by the Football League, thus becoming part of the English football pyramid, initially as the Football League Third Division. From 192122 until 195758, the Third Division South operated as the third <b>highest</b> <b>level</b> of English football, running in parallel with the Third Division North. From 195859 until 199192, Division 1 was the <b>highest</b> <b>level</b> of English football, Division 2 the second highest, Division 3 the third highest and Division 4 the fourth highest. The Premier League was formed in 199293, and since then has been the <b>highest</b> <b>level</b> of English football. Division 1 became the second level, and Division 2 the third level. In 200405, Division 1 was renamed as the Football League Championship.|$|E

40|$|Enterococci may display <b>high</b> <b>level</b> {{resistance}} to aminoglycosides, {{in which case}} synergy with cell-wall active antibiotics will be lost. All enterococcal blood culture isolates at Royal Brisbane Hospital have been screened by agar dilution for <b>high</b> <b>level</b> {{resistance to}} gentamicin and strepto-mycin since 1989. Of 110 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, 16 % displayed <b>high</b> <b>level</b> resistance to gentamicin and 10 % showed <b>high</b> <b>level</b> resistance to streptomycin. Four isolates had <b>high</b> <b>level</b> resistance to both antibiotics. None of 23 Enterococcus faecium isolates displayed <b>high</b> <b>level</b> resis-tance to gentamicin and only one to streptomycin. Two Enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to amoxycillin but none to vancomycin. There has been no apparent increase in <b>high</b> <b>level</b> aminoglycoside resistance from 1989 to 1996. <b>High</b> <b>level</b> gentamicin resistant isolates were relatively more common in liver transplant patients.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between language brokering and its effects on the level of stress of the brokers. Specifically, the relationships between language brokering, parentification, stress, and gender were explored. Gender differences in the strength of this relationship were also examined. The following was expected: <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of brokering would correlate positively with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of parentification; <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of brokering would correlate positively with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of stress; <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of parentification would correlate with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of stress; and that both brokering and parentification were gender specific, with female subjects reporting <b>higher</b> <b>levels.</b> The participants were 90 Latino undergrad students attending universities in the New York City area. The students completed several self-report measures including a parentification questionnaire, a language-brokering questionnaire, and stress scales. ^ Results showed that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of language brokering were positively correlated with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of parentification. Although no gender differences were found for levels of language brokering, females reported <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of parentification. Those who reported <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of brokering did not report <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of stress. However, those who reported <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of parentification reported <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of stress. The {{results of the present study}} emphasized the need for understanding the ramifications and long-term consequences of language brokering, particularly for the Latino community. While brokering itself may not lead to a heightened degree of stress, cultural nuances within the Latino community serve to further perpetuate the pressures associated with brokering. As such, once a pattern of brokering has been established and identified, interventions must be developed to decrease the occurrence of long term impairment of individual and family functioning. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT-In present time’s <b>High</b> <b>level</b> clones (HLC) is an {{emerging}} concept {{that uses a}} hierarchical organization of fine gained clone fragments (Simple clones) to form coarser-grained clones (<b>High</b> <b>Level</b> Clone). Different research groups categorize clones with respect to different contexts. In this paper we review all such available categories of clones and present them {{in the form of}} a <b>High</b> <b>Level</b> Clone Classification. Classification can serve various purposes like studying the more frequently occurring <b>high</b> <b>level</b> clones, prioritizing different types of <b>high</b> <b>level</b> clones, devising re-engineering strategies for different types of <b>high</b> <b>level</b> clones etc [...] For this classification of HLC we develop a fuzzy rule-based system and also visualize the results.

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{identify}} perceptions of built and social residential characteristics and their association with behaviors such as physical activity (PA), nutrition and smoking and with cardiovascular risk factors (elevated BMI and fasting blood glucose). Among participants of a preventive medical checkup at an Austrian District Health Insurance Fund (n= 904, response rate = 82. 2 %, 42 % women, 18 - 91 years) self-reported and measured data were collected. Total PA was positively associated with the presence of trees along the streets and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of pro-physical activity social modeling (SM) and it was negatively related to perceived safety from crime. More leisure-time PA was associated with <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of cycling/walking infrastructure and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of SM. PA for transportation was positively related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of connectivity and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of SM. Better behavioral cardiovascular risk factor profiles (smoking and nutrition) were associated with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of SM and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of total PA. Lower BMI values were associated with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of infrastructure and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of SM.
