40|$|This paper {{establishes}} a non linear dynamic {{model of a}} two-spool electro <b>hydraulic</b> <b>servovalve.</b> It provides {{the ability to control}} flow into and out of valves independently by two separate spools. In this valve there is a flapper/pilot and the boost stage uses two spools instead of a single spool without any feedback wire. The feedback is obtained by pressure. It is likely reduce the valve cost substantially, give higher degree of adjustment and greater safety. In this paper dynamic behavior in respect of armature deflection, spool displacement, chamber pressure, discharge and displacement of the actuator is analyzed using Matlab/Simulink to see if such a low cost servovalve can provide acceptable performance...|$|E
40|$|A warm gas {{thrust vector}} control system was studied to {{optimize}} the injection geometry for a specific engine configuration, and an injection valve was designed capable of meeting the base line requirements. To optimize injection geometry, studies were made to determine the performance effects of varying injection location, angle, port size, and port configuration. Having minimized the injection flow rate required, a warm gas valve was designed to handle the required flow. A direct drive <b>hydraulic</b> <b>servovalve</b> capable of operating with highly contaminated hydraulic fluid was designed. The valve is sized to flow 15 gpm at 3000 psia and the direct drive feature is capable of applying a spool force of 200 pounds. The baseline requirements are the development of 6 deg of {{thrust vector control}} utilizing 2000 F (total temperature) gas for 180 seconds on a 1. 37 million pound thrust engine burning LOX and RP- 1 at a chamber pressure of 250 psia with a 155 inch long conical nozzle having a 68 inch diameter throat and a 153 inch diameter exit...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} areas in the robotics industry is the development of robots capable of working in hazardous environments. As humans cannot safely or cheaply work in these environments, providing a high level of robotic functionality is important. Our work in this area focuses on a fault detection method known as analytical redundancy, or AR. In this paper we discuss the application to a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>servovalve</b> system of our novel rigorous nonlinear AR technique. AR is a model-based state-space technique that is theoretically guaranteed to derive the maximum number of independent tests of the consistency of sensor data with the system model and past control inputs. Conventional linear AR is only valid for linear sampled data systems. However, our new nonlinear AR (NLAR) technique maintains traditional linear AR’s mathematical guarantee to generate the maximum possible number of independent tests in the nonlinear domain. Thus NLAR allows us to gain the benefits of AR testing for nonlinear systems with both continuous and sampled data. National Science FoundationSandia National Laborator...|$|E

Redundant hydraulic system indirectly senses failure in any of its electrical control channels and mechanically isolates hydraulic channel controlled by faulty electrical channel so flat it cannot participate in operating system. With failure-detection and isolation technique, system can sustains two failed channels and still functions at full performance levels.

5000|$|The four servovalves in each {{actuator}} {{provided a}} [...] "force-summed majority voting" [...] arrangement {{to position the}} power spool. With four identical commands to the four servovalves, the actuator force-sum action prevented a single erroneous command from affecting power ram motion. If the erroneous command persisted {{for more than a}} predetermined time, differential pressure sensing activated a selector valve to isolate and remove the defective <b>servovalve</b> <b>hydraulic</b> pressure, permitting the remaining channels and servovalves to control the actuator ram spool.|$|R
40|$|As a key {{component}} of hydraulic control systems, hydraulic servovalves influence their performance significantly. Unpredictable self-excited noise inside hydraulic servovalves may cause instability and even failure. Being functional, with higher saturation magnetization and increased viscosity when exposed to a magnetic field, magnetic fluids (MFs) have been widely used in dampers, sealing, and biomedical treatment. In this paper, magnetic fluids are applied in the torque motor of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>servovalve</b> to exert damping and resistance for vibration and noise suppression. Construction of the torque motor armature with magnetic fluids is introduced and the forces due to magnetic fluids on the torque motor armature are studied. Based on a bi-viscosity-constituted relationship, a mathematical model of the damping force from magnetic fluids is built when magnetic fluids are filled in the working gaps of the torque motor. Measurements of the properties of an Fe 3 O 4 composite magnetic fluid are carried out to calculate the parameters of this mathematical model and to investigate the influence of magnetic fluids on the vibration characteristics of the armature assembly. The simulated and tested harmonic responses of the armature with and without magnetic fluids show the good suppression effects of magnetic fluids on the self-excited noise inside the servovalve...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- A Lyapunov-based {{discontinuous}} {{friction compensation}} technique is {{developed for the}} position regulation of a hydraulic actuator. The control scheme is capable of asymptotic position regulation with no steady-state error despite friction effects. Although, no knowledge of actuator friction, <b>servovalve</b> dynamics, or <b>hydraulic</b> parameters is required for control action, stability and effectiveness of the control scheme considering <b>hydraulic</b> nonlinearities, <b>servovalve</b> dynamics, and realistic friction model is verified both analytically and experimentally. Due to the discontinuity of the control law and the friction model, the control system is nonsmooth. Therefore, existence, continuation and uniqueness of the Filippov’s solution are, first, proven using Filippov’s solution theories. The extension of LaSalle’s invariance principle to nonsmooth systems is then employed to prove the asymptotic convergence of the system trajectories to the equilibria. Experimental results verify {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed controller in counteracting frictional effects and asymptotic convergence of the system to the desired position with no steady state error. ⋅...|$|R
