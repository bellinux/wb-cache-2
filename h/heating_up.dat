5|$|In the 1990s, various {{observations}} from Earth {{were made of}} the limb of Triton using the occultation of nearby stars, which indicated {{the presence of an}} atmosphere and an exotic surface. Observations in late 1997 suggests that Triton is <b>heating</b> <b>up</b> and the atmosphere has become significantly denser than when Voyager 2 flew past in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The first scientifically useful {{observation}} of Neptune from ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics, was commenced in 1997 from Hawaii. Neptune is currently entering its {{spring and summer}} season and {{has been shown to}} be <b>heating</b> <b>up,</b> with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence. Combined with technological advancements, ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics are recording increasingly more detailed images of it. Both Hubble and the adaptive-optics telescopes on Earth have made many new discoveries within the Solar System since the mid-1990s, with a large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the outer planet, among others. In 2004 and 2005, five new small satellites of Neptune with diameters between 38 and 61 kilometres were discovered.|$|E
5|$|Air {{compression}} on {{the outer}} surfaces caused the cabin to heat up during flight. Every surface, such as windows and panels, was warm to the touch {{by the end of}} the flight. Besides engines, the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft is the nose, due to aerodynamic heating. The engineers used Hiduminium R.R. 58, an aluminium alloy, throughout the aircraft because of its familiarity, cost and ease of construction. The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was , which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02. Concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight, first cooling down as it gained altitude, then <b>heating</b> <b>up</b> after going supersonic. The reverse happened when descending and slowing down. This had to be factored into the metallurgical and fatigue modelling. A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing. The Concorde airframe was designed for a life of 45,000 flying hours.|$|E

5|$|Males {{must first}} wait to sense a female’s pheromones {{before they can}} locate her. Before males engage in flight to find a female, they warm-up by {{shivering}} the major flight muscles to reach thoracic temperature optimal to sustain flight, around 26 degrees Celsius. The thermoregulatory shivering activities of males were measured as they were exposed to different sex-related olfactory cues. Males are found to heat up more quickly {{in the presence of}} a female pheromone and take-off at a lower thoracic temperature than males who are exposed to other chemical scents. Since <b>heating</b> <b>up</b> to the right temperature leads to better flight performance than flying immediately, there is a trade-off between sub-optimal flight performance and rapid onset of directed flight. Helicoverpa zea males exposed to an attractive pheromone blend thus spend less time shivering and increase their heating rate. Thermoregulatory behavior of unrestrained moths is associated with competition for access to females, showing the ecological trade-off.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>heating</b> <b>up</b> or cooling down fluids {{in just a}} single phase, heat exchangers can be used either to heat a liquid to evaporate (or boil) it or used as condensers to cool a vapor and condense it to a liquid. In chemical plants and refineries, reboilers used to heat incoming feed for distillation towers are often heat exchangers.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the usage}} of {{dedicated}} pyrolyzers, pyrolysis GC of solid and liquid samples can be performed directly inside Programmable Temperature Vaporizer (PTV) injectors that provide quick <b>heating</b> (<b>up</b> to 30°C/s) and high maximum temperatures of 600–650°C. This is sufficient for some pyrolysis applications. The main advantage is that no dedicated instrument has to be purchased and pyrolysis can be performed as part of routine GC analysis. In this case quartz GC inlet liners have to be used. Quantitative data can be acquired, and good results of derivatization inside the PTV injector are published as well.|$|E

25|$|Observations of the Red Spot Jr. storm suggest Jupiter {{could be}} in a period of global climate change. This is {{hypothesized}} to be part of an approximately 70 year global climate cycle, characterized by the relatively rapid forming and subsequent slow erosion and merging of cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices in Jupiter's atmosphere. These vortices facilitate the heat exchange between poles and equator. If they have sufficiently eroded, heat exchange is strongly reduced and regional temperatures may shift by as much as 10 K, with the poles cooling down and the equator region <b>heating</b> <b>up.</b> The resulting large temperature differential destabilizes the atmosphere and thereby leads to the creation of new vortices.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the absence}} of {{contemporary}} culinary utensils such as the refrigerator, gas stovetops and ovens, the Indigenous resorted to other means to prepare their food. Upon bringing back hunted game meat, the Aborigines would preserve the meat with either millet wine or salt. Another cooking technique involved the <b>heating</b> <b>up</b> of stones by fire, which are then placed inside a vessel with other certain meats and seafood, which are cooked from the heat of the stones. Foods were mostly prepared by steaming, boiling or roasting, in order to infuse flavours together, yet preserve the original flavours. This again is contrasted with the Han, who adopted skills like stir-frying and stewing. Meat was also put on a bamboo spit and cooked over the fire.|$|E
25|$|Above ground are {{foundations}} of buildings, machinery, a ramp for transportation of mine cars to different levels, {{a reservoir of}} water and depots, some with systems of <b>heating</b> <b>up</b> building materials in winter. The largest structure is a single-storey, concrete building (680m2, 2,300m3) with walls 0.5m thick and roof adapted for camouflage by vegetation (0.6m). A utility tunnel (1.25mx1.95m, 30m) was under construction to connect it with the shaft. Another structure of unknown purpose is a concrete monolith (30.9mx29.8m) with tens of pipes, drains and culverts, buried into the rock at least 4.5m.

25|$|Heat {{pumps are}} more {{effective}} for heating than for cooling an interior space if the temperature differential is held equal. This is because the compressor's input energy is also converted to useful heat when in heating mode, and is discharged along with the transported heat via the condenser to the interior space. But for cooling, the condenser is normally outdoors, and the compressor's dissipated work (waste heat) must also be transported to outdoors using more input energy, rather than being put to a useful purpose. For the same reason, opening a food refrigerator or freezer has {{the net effect of}} <b>heating</b> <b>up</b> the room rather than cooling it, because its refrigeration cycle rejects heat to the indoor air. This heat includes the compressor's dissipated work as well as the heat removed from the inside of the appliance.|$|E
25|$|Things turned around, {{and from}} 2001 to 2006, the Twins {{compiled}} the longest streak of consecutive winning seasons since moving to Minnesota, going 85–77 in 2001, 94–67 in 2002, 90–72 in 2003, 92–70 in 2004, 83-79 in 2005, and 96–66 in 2006. From 2002 to 2004, the Twins compiled their longest streak of consecutive league/division championships ever (previous were the 1924 World Champion-1925 AL Champion Senators and the 1969–70 Twins). Threatened with closure by league contraction (along with the Montreal Expos) in , the team battled back {{to reach the}} ALCS before being eliminated 4-1 by that year's eventual World Series champion Anaheim Angels.

25|$|This {{higher energy}} state is unstable, and the atom will emit an {{ultraviolet}} photon as the atom's electron reverts to a lower, more stable, energy level. Most of the photons that are {{released from the}} mercury atoms have wavelengths in the ultraviolet (UV) region of the spectrum, predominantly at wavelengths of 253.7 and 185 nanometers (nm). These are not visible to the human eye, so they must be converted into visible light. This is done by making use of fluorescence. Ultraviolet photons are absorbed by electrons in the atoms of the lamp's interior fluorescent coating, causing a similar energy jump, then drop, with emission of a further photon. The photon that is emitted from this second interaction has a lower energy {{than the one that}} caused it. The chemicals that make up the phosphor are chosen so that these emitted photons are at wavelengths visible to the human eye. The difference in energy between the absorbed ultra-violet photon and the emitted visible light photon goes toward <b>heating</b> <b>up</b> the phosphor coating.|$|E
