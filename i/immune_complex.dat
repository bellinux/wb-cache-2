25|$|Initial {{therapeutic}} antibodies were murine analogues (suffix -omab). These antibodies have: a short half-life in vivo (due to <b>immune</b> <b>complex</b> formation), limited penetration into tumour {{sites and}} inadequately recruit host effector functions. Chimeric and humanized antibodies have generally replaced them in therapeutic antibody applications. Understanding of proteomics has proven essential in identifying novel tumour targets.|$|E
40|$|It was studied whether IgG-immune {{complexes}} {{were taken}} up by liver parenchymal cells and whether liver injury was induced by the <b>immune</b> <b>complexes.</b> When asialoorosomucoid, orosomucoid and human serum albumin <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> at various antigen-antibody ratios were infused into the portal vein of rats, the antibody-excess <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> were partly {{taken up by}} liver parenchymal cells via the asialoglycoprotein receptor. However, liver injury was not caused by the <b>immune</b> <b>complexes.</b> These observations suggest that 1) <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> at certain antigen-antibody ratios bind to the asialogycoprotein receptor, 2) <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> bound to the asialoglycoprotein receptor do not activate the complement system and 3) a transient increase in plasma <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> does not induce liver injury...|$|R
40|$|Upon i. v. {{injection}} into humans, pre-formed <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> bind complement and {{adhere to}} complement receptor type I (CR 1, CD 35) on erythrocytes (immune adherence). However, in most circumstances antigen and antibody react {{in the presence}} of complement; such nascent <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> may have properties different from pre-formed <b>immune</b> <b>complexes.</b> To define whether nascent <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> would also adhere to erythrocytes in vivo in humans, we studied <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> that formed upon i. v. injection of radiolabelled hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) into immunized volunteers (eight subjects with anti-HBsAb levels ranging from undetectable to 50 U/ml.; and three control non-immune individuals). <b>Immune</b> <b>complexes</b> formed immediately in the subjects with detectable levels of specific antibody, and the clearance rate of these <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> correlated with the anti-HBsAb level (r = 0. 78, P < 0. 01). A fraction of the circulating <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> bound to erythrocytes in the three individuals with the highest antibody level (8 - 15 % at 10 min). The effect of CR 1 number per erythrocytes was analysed in two subjects with similar antibody levels and <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> clearance rates: <b>immune</b> adherence was higher in the subject with more CR 1 per erythrocytes. The same <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> model studied in vitro provided similar results: a fraction of nascent <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> bound to human erythrocytes; this immune adherence was observed only when <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> formed {{in the presence of}} antibody excess, and correlated with CR 1 number per erythrocytes (r = 0. 99, P < 0. 01). Finally, adherence of nascent HBsAg-antibody <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> to platelets was demonstrated in rabbits. Although immune adherence involves {{only a small fraction of}} nascent <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> at any given time, it may be essential for the safe disposal of large nascent <b>immune</b> <b>complexes...</b>|$|R

25|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE)* {{is a disease}} {{of the immune system}} characterized by the presence of antibodies to nucleic acid and/or antibodies to red blood cells, platelets, lymphocytes, clotting factors, and thyroglobulin. The disease can result in deposition of immune complexes or autoimmune disease. <b>Immune</b> <b>complex</b> deposition can cause vasculitis, meningitis, neuritis, and joint and skin disease. Autoimmune disease may result in hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia, which are the most common manifestations of SLE in dogs.|$|E
25|$|T-Cell-B-Cell {{discordance}} â€“ A normal {{immune response}} {{is assumed to}} involve B and T cell responses to the same antigen, even if we know that B cells and T cells recognise very different things: conformations {{on the surface of}} a molecule for B cells and pre-processed peptide fragments of proteins for T cells. However, there is nothing {{as far as we know}} that requires this. All that is required is that a B cell recognising antigen X endocytoses and processes a protein Y (normally =X) and presents it to a T cell. Roosnek and Lanzavecchia showed that B cells recognising IgGFc could get help from any T cell responding to an antigen co-endocytosed with IgG by the B cell as part of an <b>immune</b> <b>complex.</b> In coeliac disease it seems likely that B cells recognising tissue transglutamine are helped by T cells recognising gliadin.|$|E

40|$|<b>Immune</b> <b>complexes</b> {{were formed}} in vitro with {{antibodies}} obtained from rabbits immunized with bovine serum albumin in Freund's complete (FCA) or incomplete (FIA) adjuvant. The antibodies were mixed with different amounts of antigen. <b>Immune</b> <b>complexes</b> formed at maximum precipitation proportions were efficient in complement activation, whereas <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> formed at antigen excess had weak complement-activating properties. When injected into rabbit knee joints, the <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> formed at maximum precipitation proportions with FCA or FIA antibodies caused a moderate leucocyte migration into the joints with maximum cell counts 6 - 8 hr after injection. Injection into the joints of <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> formed with FCA antibodies at antigen excess induced a pronounced leucocyte migration with maximum numbers 18 hr after injection. Immunofluorescent studies indicated that these <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> became {{associated with the}} leucocyte membrane, whereas <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> formed at maximum precipitation proportions {{were found in the}} leucocyte granulae, indicating that only the complement-activating <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> were efficiently eliminated...|$|R

There was a significant association between the development of proteinuria and the high serum level of Kg-binding <b>immune</b> <b>complexes,</b> while no significant association was seen between the proteinuria and the C 1 q-binding <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> in the backcrosses.

40|$|An assay for the {{detection}} and quantitation of <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> is described. Experimental <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> or aggregated human gamma globulin (AHG) were incubated with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). After challenge of the PMN with opsonized zymosan, chemiluminescence was recorded in a scintillation spectrometer. A quantitative inhibition of chemiluminescence could be demonstrated by the interaction of PMN with <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> or AHG. Experimental <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> of bovine serum albumin-anti-bovine serum albumin were formed and tested by this assay, and <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> formed near antigen excess were best described by this technique. The technique was used to demonstrate <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> in the sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and vasculitis. <b>Immune</b> <b>complexes</b> were quantitated by reference to a standard curve using AHG. By this technique, normal human sera had < 10 micrograms of AHG per milliliter of serum. <b>Immune</b> <b>complexes</b> at levels above this were detected in 9 / 15 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, 18 / 30 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and 2 / 5 patients with vasculitis. Therefore, this assay is a sensitive, simple method for measurement of circulating <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> in the sera of patients with certain connective tissue diseases...|$|R
40|$|Since mucosal immune {{response}} involving IgA {{may be particularly}} important in the pathogenesis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE), we examined the sera of 22 patients with GSE for IgA-containing circulating <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> using a sensitive radioimmunoassay, the Raji cell assay for IgA-containing circulating <b>immune</b> <b>complexes.</b> The Raji cell assay for IgG-containing circulating <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> and the 125 I-C 1 q-binding assay were also used to measure IgG- or IgM-containing circulating <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> in these patients. Ten of 22 (45 %) patients had IgA-containing circulating <b>immune</b> <b>complexes,</b> while 11 of 22 (50 %) had IgG- or IgM-containing circulating <b>immune</b> <b>complexes.</b> Thirteen of 22 (59 %) patients had circulating <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> detected {{by at least one}} of the assays used. Neither the presence nor level of <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> correlated with disease activity in any of the patients studied. Five patients, whose disease was well controlled on a gluten-free diet, were studied serially during dietary challenge with gluten. It was found that IgA-containing circulating <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> did not develop or increase in amount in the serum of these patients despite the induction of gastrointestinal symptoms. In addition, no significant change in IgG- or IgM- containing circulating <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> occurred in any of the challenged patients. No significant abnormalities of serum complement levels (C 3, C 4, factor B) were detected in any of the patients including those challenged with gluten. Sucrose density-gradient ultracentrifugation studies revealed that the IgA-containing circulating <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> had sedimentation characteristics between 9 S and 13 S. The presence of circulating <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> in only 59 % of patients with GSE, their lack of correlation with disease activity, and their failure to change during dietary gluten challenge suggests that circulating <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> do not play a primary role in the pathogenesis of GSE...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{systemic}} {{lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) experience clinical flares in association with superimposed bacterial infection. To investigate whether heightened immune phenomena {{during the course of}} bacterial infections were related to abnormal disposal of <b>immune</b> <b>complexes,</b> we administered bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to C 57 BL/ 6 mice for 5 weeks. Control mice received vehicle only. We then challenged the mice with a subsaturating dose of radiolabelled <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> intravenously and determined the localization of <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> in liver, spleen and kidney. In comparison to control mice, mice exposed to LPS developed features of polyclonal B cell activation, autoimmune phenomena, delayed removal of <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> from the circulation, diminished liver uptake of <b>immune</b> <b>complexes,</b> and enhanced localization of <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> in the kidneys. The findings could not be attributed to biological processes dependent on complement concentration. Instead, interferences with Fc receptor function, or with endocytosis of <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> may represent likely possibilities. Thus, clinical flares in patients with SLE, {{in the presence of a}} superimposed infection, may result from enhanced localization of <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> in organs due to altered mechanisms of their disposal...|$|R

Several methods of measuring <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> have been reported. In this study, sera from 25 patients who had received renal allografts were studied {{for the presence of}} circulating <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> by using a EAC rosette inhibition test. Sera from 25 patients were divided into three groups (1. acute rejection, 2. chronic rejection, 3. no rejection episode) and EAC rosette inhibition tests performed. Serum samples from the chronic rejection group gave high inhibition of EAC rosette formation, showing good correlation with clinical chronic rejection episodes. It was concluded that circulating <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> {{play an important role in}} chronic rejection.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{isolation}} of complement-fixing <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> from human serum and the separation of antigen from antibody is described. In order to isolate the complexes, we used soluble bovine conglutinin in a three-step procedure: (1) serum containing <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> is reacted with conglutinin {{in the presence of}} 10 mM calcium; (2) the conglutinin-bound <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> are precipitated by anti-conglutinin rabbit serum; (3) the precipitate is washed and the complexes are eluted from the precipitate by EDTA (pH 7. 5) which chelates calcium and releases C 3 -associated <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> from conglutinin. To separate the antigen from the antibody, the isolated complexes are acid-dissociated (pH 3. 0), and the antibody is absorbed to staphylococcal protein A conjugated to Sepharose leaving the antigen in solution. The antibody bound to Sepharose-protein A is recovered by elution with 3. 5 M magnesium chloride. This procedure permitted {{the isolation of}} <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> from sera of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive chronic active hepatitis. In addition, <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> were isolated from sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and primary biliary cirrhosis.

By electron microscopy, the cationic complexes localized mainly in {{the inner and outer}} layers of the glomerular basement membrane and to a certain extent in the mesangial matrix in a distribution that corresponded to previously documented anionic sites. Whereas heparitinase treatment abrogated the binding of cationic <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> in both glomerular basement membrane and mesangial matrix, chondroitinase-ABC treatment did not cause any decrease in binding. In contrast, more neutral <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> appeared to be nonspecifically trapped in the mesangium, and their distribution was unaffected by both enzymatic treatments.
