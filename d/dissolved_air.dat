25|$|Wastewater is {{collected}} {{and sent to}} the City of Red Deer wastewater treatment plant which treats the sewage with a combination of grit traps, a primary clarifier, biological nutrient removal bioreactors, secondary clarifiers, and UV disinfection. Solids generated from the treatment process are treated using <b>dissolved</b> <b>air</b> flotation, anaerobic digestion, and biosolids lagoons. Treated effluent is then discharged back into the Red Deer River downstream of the water treatment plant.|$|E
25|$|Hydrocyclones {{are useful}} for the {{greatest}} range of oil droplet sizes operating from less than 10 microns and up and can operate continuously without water pre-treatment and at any temperature and pH. Applications where hydrocyclones are found are in industry where oily water sources arise in workshops, vehicle wash bays, transport hubs, fuel depots and aluminium billet processing. Animal fats from meat processing and dairy manufacturing can also be removed without the need of chemical treatment that often is required for <b>dissolved</b> <b>air</b> flotation (DAF) systems.|$|E
25|$|Effluent {{from the}} {{pulp and paper}} {{industry}} is generally high in suspended solids and BOD. Plants that bleach wood pulp for paper making may generate chloroform, dioxins (including 2,3,7,8-TCDD), furans, phenols and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Stand-alone paper mills using imported pulp may only require simple primary treatment, such as sedimentation or <b>dissolved</b> <b>air</b> flotation. Increased BOD or COD loadings, as well as organic pollutants, may require biological treatment such as activated sludge or upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors. For mills with high inorganic loadings like salt, tertiary treatments may be required, either general membrane treatments like ultrafiltration or reverse osmosis or treatments to remove specific contaminants, such as nutrients.|$|E

25|$|The {{water is}} {{pressurized}} in two stages, and flows {{through a series}} of six or seven intermediate feed water heaters, heated up at each point with steam extracted from an appropriate duct on the turbines and gaining temperature at each stage. Typically, {{in the middle of this}} series of feedwater heaters, and before the second stage of pressurization, the condensate plus the makeup water flows through a deaerator that removes <b>dissolved</b> <b>air</b> from the water, further purifying and reducing its corrosiveness. The water may be dosed following this point with hydrazine, a chemical that removes the remaining oxygen in the water to below 5 parts per billion (ppb). It is also dosed with pH control agents such as ammonia or morpholine to keep the residual acidity low and thus non-corrosive.|$|E
2500|$|When {{particles}} to {{be removed}} do not settle out of solution easily, <b>dissolved</b> <b>air</b> flotation (DAF) is often used. [...] After coagulation and flocculation processes, water flows to DAF tanks where air diffusers on the tank bottom create fine bubbles that attach to floc resulting in a floating mass of concentrated floc.

A similar effect is obtained by preheating the fuel so that {{a portion of the}} fuel flashes when its pressure is reduced. Flashing improves atomization properties and the presence of air in the primary zone of a spray flame reduces the formation of pollutants. The investigation is divided into three phases: (1) measure the solubility and density properties of fuel/gas mixtures, including Jet A/air, at pressures and correlate these results using theory; (2) investigate the atomization properties of flashing liquids, including fuel/dissolved gas systems. Determine and correlate the effect of inlet properties and injector geometry on mass flow rates, Sauter mean diameter and spray angles; (3) examine the combustion properties of flashing injection in an open burner flame, considering flame shape and soot production...|$|R

40|$|Skin {{friction}} reduction {{from the}} experimentby Kodama et al. on the position 2 (front), position 3 (midship) and position 4 (aft) at v = 7 m/s. In order to lower down the fuel consumption {{and to achieve}} higher speed of ship, reduction in ship resistance has been the major topic of research for a long time. The {{most important factor in}} ship resistance is skin friction resistance. Micro-bubble {{has been shown to be}} able to reduce skin friction. This micro-bubble method gives the possibility to lower the friction without any change in the present hull form of a ship. The application of the micro-bubble technique reduces the surface friction by a variation of the viscosity of the fluid around the ship and makes a modification in the structure of the turbulent boundary layer. However, not much is known about the correct size, quantity, area of coverage which can effectively form a skin friction reducing mechanism.

5000|$|Pristina has 9155 {{hectares}} of agricultural land, from which 8508 hectares have {{the system of}} irrigation on them. Since Pristina has a much polluted air, then it tis thought that this emission of pollution be transferred from air to land. This happens through rainfall that <b>dissolves</b> <b>air</b> pollution and deposits it into the land. One {{of the most common}} ways of agricultural land degradation is the transformation of agricultural land into industrial land. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development, in the period from 1998-2006 1 hectare of land in Pristina was transformed. However, the construction of Pristina started the last five years, with more people building apartments in each neighborhood of Pristina. [...] The problem of land degradation is that it happens in both ways: through the permition of the municipality of Pristina, but also without the permission of the municipality of Pristina. According to the director of the agricultural association in Kosovo, land degradation is happening each day more and more, and the most dangerous zones to remain without agricultural land are lands between Pristina and Skopje highway.|$|R
