5|$|By the {{afternoon}} of December30, dry air caused the system to become slightly disorganized and led forecasters to anticipate further weakening of the storm and dissipating within three days. The following day, a mid-level ridge to the north caused Zeta turn westward before nearly stalling due to upper-level westerlies. By this time, the storm attained winds of 60mph (95km/h) but increasing wind shear caused convection to become disorganized, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> weakening period. Despite the shear, the shallow structure of Zeta allowed convection to regenerate and the storm gradually re-intensified. Around 1800UTC on January 1, 2006, Zeta attained its peak intensity with winds of 65mph (100km/h) and a barometric pressure of 994mbar (hPa; 29.35inHg) roughly 1,035mi (1,665km) northwest of the Cape Verde Islands. By January2, the storm began tracking towards the southwest {{in response to a}} mid-level trough located east of the storm.|$|E

These mines had been laid beneath the road with wires leading to an electric battery and a firing key {{at the bottom of}} a lookout tree. By 13:00 however, Hill's position was reached and the Australians—now under Elwell's overall command—launched another flanking attack on the main trench blocking the road. Despite suffering heavy casualties they pressed their attack, forcing the defenders to surrender after charging the trench with fixed bayonets. A German officer and 20Melanesians were captured. Four Australians were killed, including Elwell who died leading the charge with his sword drawn, and another five were wounded.|$|E

5|$|Highway89 was {{established}} in 1937 {{as a result of}} the rerouting of Highway9 between Orangeville and Highway27. In 1963, the route was extended west to Palmerston and east to Highway400. Plans were conceived during the late 1970s to push the highway further east to Highway12 via Ravenshoe Road, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> extension to Highway11. However, environmental protest over the chosen route through the Holland Marsh resulted in the cancellation of plans in 1986. In 1997, the section between Highway400 and Highway11 was decommissioned. The most recent change to the route took place in 2003, when the section of Highway89 between Palmerston and Harriston was renumbered as part of Highway23, creating a shared terminus at a junction with Highway9.|$|E
5|$|In December, the 4th Infantry Division was {{deployed}} to Greece to reinforce British forces embroiled in the country's civil war. Conflict in Greece between government forces and Communist partisans followed the vacuum {{created by the}} German withdrawal. The partisans (ELAS) sought to establish themselves as the new political authority and confronted the British-supported government-in-exile when ordered to disband and disarm. Within 24 hours of being flown to Piraeus on 12 December, the 2nd King's had to engage partisans <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> action, seizing occupied barracks {{at a cost of}} 14 casualties. During a seven-week internal security employment, there were many instances of house-to-house and street fighting in Athens. By mid-January 1945, the city had been cleared of insurgents and a ceasefire agreed upon, followed by the Varkiza Agreement in February. The King's remained for a year to support a tense peace until they left for Cyprus.|$|E
