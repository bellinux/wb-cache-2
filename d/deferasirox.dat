During normal iron homeostasis the circulating iron is bound to transferrin, but with an iron overload, the ability for transferrin to bind iron is exceeded and non-transferrin bound iron is formed. It represents a potentially toxic iron form due to its high propensity to induce oxygen species and is responsible for cellular damage. The prevention of iron overload protects patients from morbidity and mortality. The primary aim is to bind to and remove iron from the body and a rate equal to the rate of transfusional iron input or greater than iron input. During clinical trails patients that received <b>Deferasirox</b> experienced no drug-related neutropenia or agranulocytosis, which was present with other iron chelators. Its long half life requires it to be taken once daily and provides constant chelation.

Absent a matching donor, a savior sibling can be conceived by preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to be free of the disease as well as to match the recipient's human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type.|$|E
2500|$|Although <b>deferasirox</b> is {{generally}} well tolerated (other than episodes of gastrointestinal distress and kidney dysfunction in some patients), recently a safety warning by the FDA and Novartis {{was added to}} <b>deferasirox</b> treatment guidelines.

Due to this, patients should be closely monitored on <b>deferasirox</b> therapy {{prior to the start}} of therapy and regularly thereafter.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Two {{molecules}} of <b>deferasirox,</b> an orally administered chelator, binding iron. <b>Deferasirox</b> {{is used in}} the treatment of transfusional iron overload in people with thalassemia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deferasirox</b> is an N-substituted bis-hydroxyphenyl-triazole. It {{is capable}} of {{removing}} iron from the blood through the coordination of two molecules of the <b>deferasirox</b> to a single iron ion, which forms the iron chelate (Fe-deferasirox2). Each molecule of the tridentate chelator <b>deferasirox</b> binds to the iron at three sites, using one nitrogen atom and two oxygen atoms. This results in a stable octahedral geometry around the iron centre. The ability of <b>deferasirox</b> to remove iron stems directly from its relatively small size, which is what allows it to access the iron contained within the blood and, more notably, inside tissues. Also, an important feature of <b>deferasirox</b> {{is that it has}} been shown to be highly selective for iron in the +3 oxidation state, and use of the drug does not lead to a significant decrease in the levels of other important metals in the body.|$|E
50|$|The {{half-life}} of <b>deferasirox</b> {{is between}} 8 and 16 hours allowing {{once a day}} dosing. Two molecules of <b>deferasirox</b> are capable of binding to 1 atom of iron which are subsequently eliminated by fecal excretion. Its low molecular weight and high lipophilicity allows the drug to be taken orally unlike deferoxamine which has to be administered by IV route (intravenous infusion). Together with deferiprone, <b>deferasirox</b> seems {{to be capable of}} removing iron from cells (cardiac myocytes and hepatocytes) as well as removing iron from the blood.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deferasirox</b> is most {{commonly}} marketed under {{the brand name}} Exjade. It has one key advantage over desferoxamine in {{that it can be}} taken orally in pill form, and so does not require intravenous or subcutaneous administration. With a terminal elimination half life of 8-16 hours, the <b>deferasirox</b> pill can be taken just once everyday.A once-daily dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight {{has been found to be}} sufficient for most patients for the maintenance of liver iron concentration (LIC) levels, which are usually measured as mg of iron per g of liver tissue. Larger doses may be required for some patients in order to reduce LIC levels. The ability of <b>deferasirox</b> to effectively reduce LIC levels has been well documented. One study demonstrated that after 4-5 years of <b>deferasirox</b> treatment the mean LIC levels of patients decreased from 17.4 ± 10.5 to 9.6 ± 8.0 mg Fe/g. This study showed that long-term treatment did result in a sustainable reduction in the iron burden faced by patients receiving blood transfusions for thalassemia.An additional benefit of the use of <b>deferasirox</b> instead of desferoxamine is that, unlike desferoxamine, early studies have indicated that <b>deferasirox</b> does not have a significant impact on the growth and development of pediatric thalassemia patients. In a study by Cappellini et al. it was shown that children receiving the treatment displayed continual near-normal growth and development over a 5-year study period.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deferasirox</b> can be {{prepared}} from simple commercially available starting materials (salicylic acid, salicylamide and 4-hydrazinobenzoic acid) in the following two-step synthetic sequence:The condensation of salicyloyl chloride (formed in situ from salicylic acid and thionyl chloride) with salicylamide under dehydrating reaction conditions results in formation of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3(4H)-benzoxazin-4-one. This intermediate is isolated and reacted with 4-hydrazinobenzoic acid {{in the presence of}} base to give 4-(3,5-bis(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)benzoic acid (<b>Deferasirox).</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Deferasirox</b> was the #2 drug on {{the list}} of 'Most {{frequent}} suspected drugs in reported patient deaths' compiled by the Institute for Safe Medical Practices in 2009.

50|$|It was {{approved}} by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2005.According to FDA (May 2007), renal failure and cytopenias have been reported in patients receiving <b>deferasirox</b> oral suspension tablets.

Two newer iron chelating drugs that are licensed for use in patients receiving regular blood transfusions to treat thalassaemia (and, thus, who develop iron overload as a result) are <b>deferasirox</b> and deferiprone.|$|E

50|$|Selectivity is {{determined}} by various factors. In the case of iron overload, which may occur in individuals with β-thalessemia who have received blood transfusions, the target metal ion is in the +3 oxidation state and so forms stronger complexes than the divalent ions. It also forms stronger complexes with oxygen-donor ligands than with nitrogen-donor ligands. deferoxamine, a naturally occurring siderophore produced by the actinobacter Streptomyces pilosus and was used initially as a chelation therapy agent. Synthetic siderophores such as deferiprone and <b>deferasirox</b> have been developed, using the known structure of deferoxamine as a starting point. Chelation occurs with the two oxygen atoms.|$|E
50|$|Thalassemia {{results in}} nontransferrin-bound iron being {{available}} in blood {{as all the}} transferrin becomes fully saturated. This free iron is toxic to the body since it catalyzes reactions that generate free hydroxyl radicals. These radicals may induce lipid peroxidation of organelles like lysosomes, mitochondria, and sarcoplasmic membranes. The resulting lipid peroxides may interact with other molecules to form cross links, and thus either cause these compounds to perform their functions poorly, or render them non-functional altogether. This iron overload may be treated with chelation therapy. Deferoxamine, deferiprone and <b>deferasirox</b> are the three most widely used iron-chelating agents.|$|E
5000|$|Treatment of {{individuals}} with CDA usually consist of frequent blood transfusions, but this can {{vary depending on the}} type that the individual has. [...] Patients report going every 2-3 weeks for blood transfusions. In addition, they must undertake chelation therapy to survive; either deferoxamine, <b>deferasirox,</b> or deferiprone to eliminate the excess iron that accumulates. Removal of the spleen and gallbladder are common. Hemoglobin levels can run anywhere between 8.0 g/dl and 11.0 g/dl in untransfused patients, the amount of blood received by the patient is not as important as their baseline pre-transfusion hemoglobin level. This is true for ferritin levels and iron levels in the organs as well, it is important for patients to go regularly for transfusions in order to maximize good health, normal ferritin levels run anywhere between 24 and 336 ng/ml, hematologists generally do not begin chelation therapy until ferritin levels reach at least 1000 ng/ml. It is more important to check iron levels in the organs through MRI scans, however, than to simply get regular blood tests to check ferritin levels, which only show a trend, and do not reflect actual organ iron content.|$|E
40|$|We {{sought to}} {{describe}} the safety profile of open-label, adjunctive <b>deferasirox</b> iron chelation therapy in eight patients with biopsy-proven mucormycosis. <b>Deferasirox</b> was administered {{for an average of}} 14 days (range, 7 to 21) at 5 to 20 mg/kg of body weight/day. The only adverse effects attributable to <b>deferasirox</b> were rashes in two patients. <b>Deferasirox</b> treatment was not associated with changes in renal or liver function, complete blood count, or transplant immunosuppressive levels. Thus, <b>deferasirox</b> appears safe as an adjunctive therapy for mucormycosis...|$|E
40|$|Preparation of <b>Deferasirox</b> in {{nano-scale}} by ultrasonic irradiation and optimization {{the amount}} and reaction time parameters This work reports a facile sonochemical route in the synthesis of nano particle of <b>deferasirox</b> for the first time. One application of nanotechnology is in improvement of available treatments for various diseases. <b>Deferasirox</b> (ICL 670 or Exjade) is a tridentate chelating agent for removing transfusion overload iron in thalassemia patients. In the present work, <b>deferasirox</b> was prepared in nano size by using of ultrasound waves. The effects of amount and reaction time {{on the size of}} <b>deferasirox</b> were investigated. These parameters were optimized at various amounts and different reaction times. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies show that the <b>deferasirox</b> in nature structure does not change during the reaction. The results show that the finest particle is related to the following conditions: 45 min, time reaction and 0. 1 g, amount of <b>deferasirox.</b> Therefore, the ultrasonic bath method has a fundamental role in the preparation of <b>deferasirox</b> in nano scale.

40|$|<b>Deferasirox</b> (ICL 670) is {{representative}} of {{a new class of}} tridentate iron chelators, formulated as tablets for dispersion. <b>Deferasirox</b> has exhibited high potency and a clinically manageable safety profile in preclinical models and in an extensive clinical program. The effect of food and time of food intake on the pharmacokinetics of <b>deferasirox</b> was investigated in healthy volunteers and patients with transfusional hemosiderosis. The bioequivalence of a single oral dose of <b>deferasirox</b> (20 mg/kg) was assessed following administration either before a high-fat or standard breakfast or concurrent with a standard breakfast in comparison with fasted conditions in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of <b>deferasirox</b> was determined following a single oral dose (20 mg/kg) under fed and fasted conditions in patients. These data show that the type of food, caloric content, and fat content of the meal influence the bioavailability of <b>deferasirox</b> when consumed concomitantly. In contrast, {{this is not the case}} when <b>deferasirox</b> is administered at least 30 minutes before a meal. In conclusion, it is recommended that <b>deferasirox</b> be administered at least 30 minutes prior to meals. When this is not feasible, <b>deferasirox</b> should be administered consistently at the same time before meals to limit the sources of variability that affect absorption...|$|E
40|$|This {{prospective}} randomized phase II study {{aimed to}} determine the safety and efficacy of <b>deferasirox</b> in preventing iatrogenic iron overload in patients receiving induction/consolidation chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) ize. Serum ferritin, transferrin saturation and CRP were measured pre-, mid- and post- each chemotherapy cycle. Patients were randomized to receive either therapy with <b>deferasirox</b> vs. no <b>deferasirox</b> therapy once serum ferritin increased to > 500 μg/l. The trial was stopped prematurely due to excess gastrointestinal (GI) and infectious toxicity demonstrable in the <b>deferasirox</b> arm, after 10 patients had been randomized to <b>deferasirox</b> and 6 patients to the control arm. Overall, <b>deferasirox</b> was poorly tolerated, with median maximum tolerated dose only 13 · 8 mg/kg/d and no patient able to tolerate doses > 20 mg/kg/d. Median duration of <b>deferasirox</b> therapy was only 72 d (range 19 - 130 d), with 9 / 10 patients requiring unplanned dose interruptions and 4 / 10 patients unable to continue the drug predominantly due to GI effects. Although all 3 treatment-related deaths occurred in the <b>deferasirox</b> arm (P = 0 · 25), median overall survival was similar between treatment arms.

As patients with sickle cell disease often have abnormal baseline renal function, the primary objective of this randomised, open-label, phase II trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of <b>deferasirox</b> in comparison with deferoxamine in this population. Assessment of efficacy, as measured by change in liver iron concentration (LIC) using biosusceptometry, was a secondary objective. A total of 195 adult and paediatric patients received <b>deferasirox</b> (n = 132) or deferoxamine (n = 63). Adverse events most commonly associated with <b>deferasirox</b> were mild, including transient nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and skin rash. Abnormal laboratory studies with <b>deferasirox</b> were occasionally associated with mild non-progressive increases in serum creatinine and reversible elevations in liver function tests. Discontinuation rates from <b>deferasirox</b> (11 · 4 %) and deferoxamine (11 · 1 %) were similar.

40|$|<b>Deferasirox</b> is an orally {{effective}} iron (Fe) chelator {{currently used}} {{for the treatment of}} iron-overload disease and has been implemented {{as an alternative to the}} gold standard chelator, desferrioxamine (DFO). Earlier studies demonstrated that DFO exhibits anticancer activity due to its ability to deplete cancer cells of iron. In this investigation, we examined the in vitro and in vivo activity of <b>deferasirox</b> against cells from human solid tumors. To date, there have been no studies to investigate the effect of <b>deferasirox</b> on these types of tumors in vivo. <b>Deferasirox</b> demonstrated similar activity at inhibiting proliferation of DMS- 53 lung carcinoma and SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cell lines compared with DFO. Furthermore, <b>deferasirox</b> was generally similar or slightly more effective than DFO at mobilizing cellular 59 Fe and inhibiting iron uptake from human transferrin depending on the cell type. However, <b>deferasirox</b> potently inhibited DMS- 53 xenograft growth in nude mice when given by oral gavage, with no marked alterations in normal tissue histology. To understand the antitumor activity of <b>deferasirox,</b> we investigated its effect on the expression of molecules that play key roles in metastasis, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. We demonstrated that <b>deferasirox</b> increased expression of the metastasis suppressor protein N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 and upregulated the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p 21 CIP 1 /WAF 1 while decreasing cyclin D 1 levels. Moreover, this agent increased the expression of apoptosis markers, including cleaved caspase- 3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1.
