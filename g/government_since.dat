5|$|During the {{administration}} of Ferdinand Marcos, the region of Metro Manila was created as an integrated unit with the enactment of Presidential Decree No. 824 on November 7, 1975. The area encompassed four cities and thirteen adjoining towns, as a separate regional unit of government. On the 405th anniversary of the city's foundation on June 24, 1976, Manila was reinstated by Marcos as {{the capital of the}} Philippines for its historical significance as the seat of <b>government</b> <b>since</b> the Spanish Period. Presidential Decree No. 940 states that Manila has always been to the Filipino people and {{in the eyes of the}} world, the premier city of the Philippines being the center of trade, commerce, education and culture.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, a {{currency}} reform introduced a bimetallic standard, which {{went into effect}} in July 1883. Unlike many precious metal standards the system was very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue. The period of convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes. The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the <b>government,</b> <b>since,</b> having no institutional power over the monetary system, there was little they could do to prevent it.|$|E
5|$|Media exposés {{and popular}} outrage led Congress {{to pass by}} {{unanimous}} vote the Sexual Exploitation of Children Act of 1977, which criminalized the production and sale of child porn. This act {{was signed into law}} by President Jimmy Carter on February 6, 1978. The legislation was supported by a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court in New York v. Ferber, , that images of children need not meet legal definitions of obscenity to be prohibited by the <b>government,</b> <b>since</b> the state's interest in protecting children from harm trumped First Amendment rights in this instance.|$|E

5|$|On 20 August, {{the central}} {{government}} decided not {{to intervene in the}} suspension of Nagpal, as she did not appeal or challenge the suspension order given by the Uttar Pradesh <b>government.</b> <b>Since</b> Nagpal's suspension on 27 July, the Centre had issued three reminders to the UP government, seeking a detailed report. On 4 August, the UP government had sent a report on Nagpal's suspension to the DoPT and had served a chargesheet to Nagpal, which deemed her actions as unwarranted and in violation of rules.|$|E
5|$|The NCMP {{scheme was}} {{introduced}} in 1984, and was a significant modification of the traditional Westminster system of <b>government.</b> <b>Since</b> the ruling People's Action Party had won all parliamentary seats in the four general elections since independence, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew argued that the NCMP scheme would ensure that opposition voices would be heard in Parliament. According to him, this would be beneficial to Singapore as it would give the younger generation of Singaporeans {{a chance to see}} what an opposition can or cannot do. When the first constitutional amendment was made to initiate the NCMP scheme, between three and six NCMPs were allowed in Parliament. The Constitution was amended again in 2010 to allow for a maximum of nine NCMPs in Parliament.|$|E

5|$|The events {{surrounding}} {{the formation of}} the United Kingdom's government in 2010 took place between 7 May and 12 May 2010, following the 2010 general election, which failed to produce an overall majority for any of the country's three main political parties. The election, held on 6 May, resulted in the first hung parliament in the UK in 36 years, sparking a series of negotiations which would form the first coalition <b>government</b> <b>since</b> the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|To {{assist the}} new <b>government,</b> <b>since</b> February 2000 the United Nations {{has had the}} United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (now called MONUSCO), which {{currently}} has a strength of over 16,000 peacekeepers in the country. Its principal tasks are to provide security in key areas, such as the South Kivu and North Kivu in the east, and to assist the government in reconstruction. Foreign rebel groups {{are also in the}} Congo, as they have been {{for most of the last}} half-century. The most important is the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), against which Laurent Nkunda's troops were fighting, but other smaller groups such as the anti-Ugandan Lord's Resistance Army are also present.|$|E
5|$|Although the country's {{reliance}} on foreign workers {{has been a}} concern to the Saudi <b>government</b> <b>since</b> the mid-1950s, the situation has persisted because of a reluctance by Saudis to take on menial work and a shortage of Saudi candidates for skilled jobs. This has, in part, been blamed on the Saudi education system, which {{has been criticized for}} its emphasis on religion and rote learning. The Saudi economy has, therefore, remained dependent on Westerners for expertise in specialised industries and on the Asian workforce for the construction industry as well as for menial and unskilled tasks. In response, since 1995 the Saudi government has initiated a policy of Saudization, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals. For example, in 2000, it was decreed that the work force of businesses with more than 20 employees must be at least 25 per cent Saudi. In the private sector, there has been a reluctance to employ Saudis and Saudization is generally considered to have been a failure. Saudis themselves may be unwilling to take certain jobs, considering them to lack social value.|$|E

5|$|Article {{five of the}} Constitution {{declared}} Catholicism to be {{the state}} religion. However, the clergy had long been understaffed, undisciplined and poorly educated, all of {{which led to a}} general loss of respect for the Catholic Church. During PedroII's reign, the Imperial government embarked upon a program of reform designed to address these deficiencies. As Catholicism was the official religion, the Emperor exercised a great deal of control over Church affairs and paid clerical salaries, appointed parish priests, nominated bishops, ratified papal bulls and supervised seminaries. In pursuing reform, the government selected bishops whose moral fitness, stance on education and support for reform met with their approval. However, as more capable men began to fill the clerical ranks, resentment of government control over the Church increased. Catholic clerics moved closer to the Pope and his doctrines. This resulted in the Religious Question, a series of clashes during the 1870s between the clergy and the <b>government,</b> <b>since</b> the former wanted a more direct relationship with Rome and the latter sought to maintain its oversight of church affairs.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1920s, {{the role of the}} Catholic Church grew. This was {{encouraged}} by the Belgian <b>government,</b> <b>since</b> the priests knew the country well and facilitated its administration. Many Rwandans (including elite Tutsi) converted, since Catholicism was an increasing prerequisite for social advancement. King Musinga refused to convert, and in 1931 he was deposed by the Belgian administration; his eldest son, Mutara III Rudahigwa, succeeded him and eventually became Rwanda's first Christian king. During the 1930s the Belgians introduced large-scale projects in education, health, public works and agricultural supervision, including new crops and agricultural techniques to improve food supply. Though Rwanda was modernised the Tutsis remained in power, leaving the Hutu disenfranchised and subject to large-scale forced labour. In 1935 Belgium introduced identity cards, labelling an individual as Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. Although wealthy Hutu had previously been able to become honorary Tutsi, the identity cards ended further social mobility.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{political}} differences among factions in the Polish exile government, and in particular, SZP {{ties to the}} Sanacja regime which dominated the Polish <b>government</b> <b>since</b> mid-1920s, the SZP was reorganized into the Union of Armed Struggle (Związek Walki Zbrojnej, ZWZ) on 13 November 1939. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski supported that move, aiming to include parties marginalized by the Sanacja regime, and supported {{the formation of the}} Main Political Council (Główna Rada Polityczna, GRP). Sikorski named General Kazimierz Sosnkowski the head of the ZWZ and Colonel Stefan Rowecki was appointed the commander of the ZWZ German occupation zone. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski became the commander of the ZWZ Soviet zone, but was arrested in March 1940 by the Soviets when attempting to cross the new German-Soviet border. In June Sikorski appointed Rowecki as the commander of both zones.|$|E
