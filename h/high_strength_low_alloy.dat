The fatigue cracking of the component occurred during the application of standardized blocks of fatigue loading.

An in-depth analysis of this region showed that there was presence of stress concentration, and the microstructure of the steel has been completely changed, due to an excessive amount of heat {{at the beginning of the}} welding.

Testing sponsored by the PVRC over 20 years ago was done by pressurizing circular flat disks made from three different materials until failure by bursting. The purpose of this re-analysis is to investigate the use of finite element analysis (FEA) to assess the primary stress limits of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (1998) and to qualify the use of elastic-plastic (EP-FEA) for limit load calculations. The three materials tested represent the range of strength and ductility found in modern pressure vessel construction and include a <b>low</b> <b>strength</b> <b>high</b> ductility material, a medium strength medium ductility material, and a <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>low</b> ductility <b>low</b> <b>alloy</b> material. Results of elastic and EP-FEA are compared to test data. Stresses from the elastic analyses are linearized for comparison of Code primary stress limits to test results. Elastic-plastic analyses are done using both best-estimate and elastic-perfectly plastic (EPP) stress-strain curves. Both large strain-large displacement (LSLD) and small strain-small displacement (SSSD) assumptions are used with the EP-FEA.

40|$|The {{location}} {{of oil and}} gas reserves in Australia and the distribution of centres of population have created a need for an extensive network of land based transmission pipelines. There is a continuing need to expand this network but this must be achieved within increasingly stringent cost targets and in accordance with changing environmental constraints. The pipeline industry in Australia has traditionally employed smaller diameter and thinner wall pipe materials than are common in many other parts of the world. In order to improve cost effectiveness there is also a trend to increase the yield strength of the material and to further reduce wall thickness. Girth welding of pipelines in the field represents a significant proportion of the installation cost and is currently performed by highly skilled manual welders using the shielded metal arc process (SMAW), cellulosic electrodes and a 2 ̆ 7 stovepipe 2 ̆ 7 technique. The use of lower wall thickness has the potential {{to reduce the number of}} weld runs and the overall cost. The <b>higher</b> yield <b>strength</b> <b>low</b> <b>alloy</b> pipe materials have been shown to have excellent weldability but as yield strength increases there may be an increased risk of weld metal cracking, particularly if overmatching welds are required. The current Australian field welding practice has been analysed and the local constraints identified. Based on this review a list of desirable attributes for suitable processes was drawn up. The international literature on process options for mechanised girth welding was reviewed and techniques, which fitted the Australian requirements were identified. The most attractive mechanised girth welding options for further investigation were identified as: • GMAW (New technology controlled transfer) • Pulsed plasma keyhole welding • High current (buried arc/keyhole) GTAW 3 ̆c• MIAB welding The rationale behind these suggestions is discussed and the implications for the pipeline industry in adopting mechanised girth welding are explored. Suggestions regarding the design of suitable systems are put forward. A practical assessment of the first of these short listed options was conducted and found to offer considerable promise. This process is tolerant to gap variations, inaccuracy in groove preparation and pipe misalignment. High welding speeds (735 mm/min) are also achieved, with high quality welds deposited without varying welding parameters as the arc progresses along the circumference. Monitoring the weld quality in the real time was also achieved. The preliminary calculations of root weld strength indicates that clamp could be released at 23...|$|R
40|$|Friction Flash to Tube (F 2 T) is an {{innovative}} friction based manufacturing technique to produce seamless tubes based on open die forging, invented at Aalto University. These tubes {{can be produced}} economically in small sizes and batches, envisaging applications of high value materials that are not available in the market. The objective of this Master thesis was to develop the experimental condition of F 2 T {{as well as the}} proper parameters in F 2 T by approaching Taguchi method. The pre-defined parameters to investigate in Taguchi method were established as forging force, tool rotation and initial transient plunging depth and the investigating of geometrical and metallurgical characteristics were done. Cold rolled <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> and <b>low</b> <b>alloy</b> structural steel S 355 is the material used in this research work. The parameters of the F 2 T process were developed based on design of experiments, with geometrical and hardness properties as performance parameters. The optimized conditions and parameters were applied to produce tubes for extensive evalua-tion of the mechanical and metallurgical material properties. The F 2 T process has specific components and control demands that cannot be met by the existing manufacturing systems. This challenge was overcome by developing one first version of a dedicated system based on an existent Friction Stir Welding equipment. One additional challenge was to produce tubes longer than 40 mm because of buckling. The buckling was prevented by implementing a lateral support system constraining the consumable rod during the initial transient plunging period. The test specimens for extensive mechanical test and metallurgical analysis were extracted from tubes produced with 80 mm in length. These longer tubes were manufactured using the support system to prevent buckling. The results on tensile test, flattening test and flare test of F 2 T tube reveal that the mechanical properties of produced tubes are as good as tube of similar material produced by another manufacturing technique. The temperature during the application of the F 2 T process was monitored with thermo-couples. The mechanical properties of produced tubes were evaluated by hardness meas-urement of cross and longitudinal sections. Tensile test were applied to sub-sections of wall of the tubes, and flare and flattening test to the whole tubes. The metallurgical analysis encompasses optical microscopic analysis, and SEM/EBSD with grain size evaluation. The research work demonstrate the feasibility of producing seamless tubes by F 2 T in structural steel.

40|$|Sheet {{metal forming}} {{processes}} {{are widely used}} in the automotive industry to fabricate many components such as body panels, the structural members of the chassis and so on. The forming process involves many stages. There are many defects that might occur on a work piece during or after each set of processes {{and one of the}} most challenging of these is associated with the phenomenon of springback; that is, the distortion in specimen geometry due to the elastic recovery and other effects. The integration of springback into the design of the forming process represents a significant challenge due to difficulties associated with its prediction. There are several factors that control the magnitude and direction of component distortion causing by springback. The primary aim of the present study is to evaluate the influence exerted on springback by the main parameters that affect the forming process. This will provide guide lines to create new CAE methods that can be used to predict the amount of springback within sheet metal forming processes. Two common forming processes will be investigated within this work, the so called L-bending and U-drawing processes, since these underpin many of the more complex forming operations. A forming test rig has been designed and manufactured that replicates each of these processes under controlled and repeatable conditions. Process parameters that can be controlled are the die and punch profile radii and clearance between the punch and die, and the normal clamp load applied on the work piece by the blank holder. In parallel, finite element models capable of simulating the L-bending and U-drawing bending processes were developed and validated for four different blanks materials: <b>high</b> and <b>low</b> <b>strength</b> steel, and <b>high</b> and <b>low</b> <b>strength</b> aluminium <b>alloy.</b> Material characterization for four different blanks was conducted to derive required parameters for the simulation analysis. Also, friction coefficients were measured between each blank material and the forming tools using a pendulum tribometer. Mesh sensitivity studies were firstly conducted to provide a mesh that represents an appropriate compromise between accuracy and consuming time. Results from the numerical analysis were compared to those from the experiments and good agreement was generally found, except for the <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> steel where the galvanised coating (not modelled in the analysis) affected the results. The model was then used to conduct parametric studies on the effect of certain parameters on the amount of the springback i. e. the blank holder load, die and punch radii and the radial clearance. Finally, an optimisation scheme was developed to derive the optimum combination of parameters to minimise springback. These results and the general methodology could form the basis of a reliable CAE system to control springback in common metal forming operations. ...|$|R

Shock-resisting group tool steels (S) are designed to resist shock at both low and high temperatures. A low carbon content {{is required for the}} necessary toughness (approximately 0.5% carbon). Carbide-forming alloys provide the necessary abrasion resistance, hardenability, and hot-work characteristics. This family of steels displays very high impact toughness and relatively low abrasion resistance and can attain relatively high hardness (HRC 58/60). In the US, toughness usually derives from 1 to 2% silicon and 0.5-1% molybdenum content.

40|$|Many {{metallic}} structural components {{come into}} contact with hydrogen during manufacturing processes or forming operations such as hot stamping of auto body frames and while in service. This interaction of metallic parts with hydrogen can occur due to various reasons such as water molecule dissociation during plating operations, interaction with atmospheric hydrogen due to the moisture present in air during stamping operations or due to prevailing conditions in service (e. g. : acidic or marine environments). Hydrogen, being much smaller in size compared to other metallic elements such as Iron in steels, can enter the material and become dissolved in the matrix. It can lodge itself in interstitials locations of the metal atoms, at vacancies or dislocations in the metallic matrix or at grain boundaries or inclusions (impurities) in the alloy. This dissolved hydrogen can affect the functional life of these structural components leading to catastrophic failures in mission critical applications resulting in loss of lives and structural component. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} understand the influence of the dissolved hydrogen on the failure of these structural materials due to cyclic loading (fatigue). For the next generation of hydrogen based fuel cell vehicles and energy systems, it is very crucial to develop structural materials for hydrogen storage and containment which are highly resistant to hydrogen embrittlement. These materials should also be able to provide good long term life in cyclic loading, without undergoing degradation, even when exposed to hydrogen rich environments for extended periods of time. The primary focus of this investigation was to examine the influence of dissolved hydrogen on the fatigue crack growth behaviour of a commercially available <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> medium carbon <b>low</b> <b>alloy</b> (AISI 4140) steel. The secondary objective was to examine the influence of microstructure on the fatigue crack growth behaviour of this material and to determine the hydrogen induced failure mechanism in this material during cyclic loading. The secondary objective of this investigation was to determine the role of inclusions and their influence in affecting the fatigue crack growth rate of this material. Compact tension and tensile specimens were prepared as per ASTM E- 647, E- 399 and E- 8 standards. The specimens were tested in three different heat treated conditions i. e. annealed (as received) as well as two austempered conditions. These specimens were precharged with hydrogen (ex situ) using cathodic charging method at a constant current density at three different time periods ranging from 150 to 250 hours before conducting fatigue crack growth tests. Mode 1 type fatigue tests were then performed in ambient atmosphere at constant amplitude using load ratio R of 0. 1. The near threshold fatigue crack growth rate, fatigue threshold and the fatigue crack growth rate in the linear region were determined. Fatigue crack growth behaviour of specimens without any dissolve hydrogen were then compared with the specimens with different concentration of dissolved hydrogen. The test results show that the dissolved hydrogen concentration increases with the increase in charging time in all three heat treated conditions and the hydrogen uptake shows a strong dependence on the microstructure of the alloy. It was also observed that the microstructure has a significant influence of on the fatigue crack growth and SCC behaviour of the alloy with dissolved hydrogen. As the dissolved hydrogen concentration increases, the fatigue threshold was found to decrease and the near threshold crack growth rate increases in all three heat treated conditions showing the deleterious effect of hydrogen, but to a different extent in each condition. Current test results also indicate that the fatigue crack growth rates in the linear region increases as the dissolved hydrogen content increases in all three heat treated conditions. It is also observed that increasing the austempering temperature decreases the resistance to hydrogen embrittlement. An interesting phenomenon was also observed in annealed specimen charged with hydrogen for 250 h which had an unusually high fatigue threshold (ΔKth) ...|$|R
