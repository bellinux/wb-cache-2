5000|$|Mothproofing {{chemicals}} - Treatment {{of materials}} as a preventive measure before their use, {{as well as}} simply for storage, has a long history. [...] Arsenical compounds were effective in killing larvae but were considered too toxic for human contact even {{in the early twentieth}} century. Triphenyltin chloride was effective at 0.25%. After 1947, chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides of many varieties were found to be effective at the low concentrations practical for preservative treatment. [...] Examples are chlordane at 2% per weight of wool, toxaphene at 0.8%, pentachlorophenol or BHC at 0.5%, DDT at 0.2%, chlordecone and mirex at 0.06%, and dieldrin at 0.05%. Imidazole (a non-chloronated aromatic heterocyclic) at 1% also gave satisfactory protection. Besides solvent-based applications, insecticidal dusts were commonly used to treat fabrics. In the 1950s EQ-53, a DDT emulsion, was recommended by the US Department of Agriculture to add to the final rinse of washable woolens, but even then cautions were given to the use of chlorinated hydrocarbons on items subject to commercial drycleaning. The 1985 United States EPA ban on most uses of Aldrin and Dieldrin exempted moth-proofing in a closed manufacturing process. Triazole, thiazole, and imidazole derivatives have an anti-feeding effect on Tineola bisselliella larvae when wool is treated with these compounds.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} <b>econazole</b> on {{intracellular}} calcium levels ([Ca 2 +]i) in Madin Darby canine kidney cells was investigated using fura- 2 fluorimetry. <b>Econazole</b> increased [Ca 2 +]i dose-dependently at 5 – 50 μM. The Ca 2 + signal consisted of an initial rise, a gradual decay and a sustained plateau. Extracellular Ca 2 + removal partially reduced the <b>econazole</b> response. Mn 2 + quench of fura- 2 fluorescence confirmed econazole-induced Ca 2 + influx. The econazole-sensitive intracellular Ca 2 + store overlaps with that sensitive to thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + pump, because 25 μM <b>econazole</b> depleted the thapsigargin-sensitive store, and conversely, thapsigargin abolished the <b>econazole</b> response. <b>Econazole</b> (25 – 50 μM) partially inhibited capacitative Ca 2 + entry induced by cyclopiazonic acid, another endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + pump inhibitor, measured by depleting internal Ca 2 + store in Ca 2 +-free medium followed by adding 10 mM CaCl 2. <b>Econazole</b> induced capacitative Ca 2 + entry itself.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Econazole,</b> an azole {{compound}} {{widely used}} as an antifungal drug, is currently investigated for additional therapeutic effects. In fact, the antitumoral properties of <b>econazole</b> have been recently demonstrated, both in vivo and at the cellular level. However, the precise mechanism of action behind its effects is still unclear. Aim: To {{examine the effect of}} <b>econazole</b> on intracellular Ca 2 + signaling pathways in a human adenocarcinoma cell line. Methods: [Ca 2 +]i was measured in Fura 2 -loaded HT 29 cells by fluorescence. Fluorescence was recorded from 1 ml aliquots of magnetically stirred HT 29 cells using a Cary Eclipse Spectrophotometer (Varian Ltd., Madrid, Spain) with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and emission at 510 nm. Results: We have demonstrated that <b>econazole</b> has a dual effect on Ca 2 + homeostasis. It caused a dose-dependent increase in [Ca 2 +]i. Both mobilization from thapsigargin-sensitive stores and extracellular Ca 2 + influx contributed to the effect. A phospholipase C-dependent pathway proved to be activated by <b>econazole.</b> In addition, <b>econazole</b> greatly inhibited a physiological activation of store-operated Ca 2 + entry. Conclusion: This study provides further molecular mechanism of <b>econazole</b> suggesting that this drug may modify the physiology of human adenocarcinoma HT 29 cell line.

The results observed in osteoblast-like UMR- 106 cells pretreated with <b>econazole,</b> bifonazole or clotrimazole and stimulated by arachidonic acid were similar with the exception of clotrimazole which was a more effective inhibitor of PGE 2 biosynthesis than in MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells. Upon treatment with arachidonic acid thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2) production in human platelets was abolished completely at concentrations of the three imidazole antimycotics higher than 5 [*]μM (IC 50 < 1 [*]μM).

Hence {{the present study was}} designed to evaluate the in vivo antimycobacterial potential of moxifloxacin and <b>econazole</b> alone and in combination against multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in a mice model. Methods: Mice were infected with 2. 5 × 10 [7] bacilli of MDR strain of M. tuberculosis by aerosol route of infection. After four weeks of infection, chemotherapy was started orally by moxifloxacin 8. 0 mg/kg body wt and <b>econazole</b> 3. 3 mg/kg alone and in combination, as well as with four first line anti-tuberculosis drugs as a positive control. The animals were sacrificed and the lungs and spleen were excised under aspetic conditions. The tissues were homogenized with sterile normal saline, an aliquot of the homogenate was plated on Middlebrook 7 H 11 agar supplemented with oleate albumin dextrose catalase (OADC) and incubated at 37 °C for four weeks. The number of visible and individual colonies were counted. Results: The first line anti-tuberculosis drugs (RIF+INH+EMB+PZA) after eight weeks of therapy had no impact as the bacillary load in lungs and spleens remained unchanged. However, <b>econazole,</b> moxifloxacin alone as well as in combination significantly reduced the bacillary load in lungs as well as in spleens of MDR-TB bacilli infected mice. Interpretation & conclusions: Co-administration of the two drugs (<b>econazole</b> and moxifloxacin) to MDR-TB strain JAL- 7782 infected mice exhibited additive effect, the efficacy of the drugs in combination being higher as compared with ECZ or MOX alone. These results were substantiated by histopathological studies.

Several predisposing factors, such as diabetes mellitus,using contraceptive, pregnancy, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are reported as main risk factors for the infection. While, the main etiologic agent of vulvovaginal candidiasis is Candida albicans, more antifungal resistance has been reported among non-albicans species [...] Objective: The aim of the present study was to determine susceptibility patterns of vaginal isolates of Candida to eight antifungal drugs including, clotrimazole, miconazole, terbinafine,nystatin, itraconazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, and <b>econazole</b> [...] Patients and Methods: Tested organisms were C. albicans 53 (79. 1 %), C. glabrata 8 (11. 9 %), C. tropicalis 4 (5. 9 %) and C. krusei 2 (2. 9 %) that were isolated from vaginal infected patients. Disk diffusion method was used to evaluate susceptibility patterns. Paper disks containing clotrimazole, miconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, <b>econazole,</b> nystatin and terbinafine were applied for susceptibility tests [...] Results: In the present study 2 isolates of C. krusei were sensitive to ketoconazole, clotrimazole and miconazole. In addition both isolates were resistant to fluconazole, nystatin, <b>econazole</b> and terfinafine. Only one isolate of C. tropicalis was sensitive to miconazole and terbinafine and two isolates to clotrimazole.

40|$|Cytochrome P- 450 {{has been}} {{suggested}} as a mediator of the signal between depleted platelet calcium stores {{and an increase in}} plasma membrane permeability to calcium which follows depletion of the stores. This hypothesis is based on the observations that inhibitors of cytochrome P- 450, such as the imidazole antifungal agents, also inhibit influx of a calcium surrogate (manganese) into calcium-depleted platelets. We tested the effects of <b>econazole</b> and of a cytochrome P- 450 inhibitor, carbon monoxide (CO), on thapsigargin (TG) -induced platelet 45 Ca 2 + influx. TG specifically depletes internal calcium stores and activates store-regulated calcium influx. <b>Econazole</b> blocked 45 Ca 2 + influx when it was added before TG (IC 50 11 microM). <b>Econazole</b> at a concentration (20 microM) that inhibited 83 % of TG-induced calcium influx was not inhibitory to TG-induced calcium efflux from 45 Ca(2 +) -loaded platelets, and did not affect calcium fluxes in resting platelets. This <b>econazole</b> concentration was also inhibitory to calcium influx even when it was added after the stores had been calcium-depleted by EGTA and TG for 15 min and the signal to increase calcium influx had already been generated. Inhibition of cytochrome P- 450 with CO bubbled through platelet suspensions did not change calcium influx in resting cells and potentiated TG-induced calcium influx (160 % of control calcium accumulation at 20 min). This effect appeared to be concentration-dependent, such that a 5 min exposure to CO produced a greater influx potentiation than a 3 min exposure. These observations indicate that (1) cytochrome P- 450 does not mediate store-regulated calcium influx, and (2) <b>econazole</b> probably inhibits store-regulated calcium influx by an alternative mechanism, such as interaction with plasma membrane calcium channels...|$|E
