25|$|Computational {{advances}} in pharmacogenomics {{has proven to}} be a blessing in research. As a simple example, for nearly a decade the ability to store more information on a hard drive has <b>enabled</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> investigate a human genome sequence cheaper and in more detail with regards to the effects/risks/safety concerns of drugs and other such substances. Such computational advances are expected to continue in the future. The aim is to use the genome sequence data to effectively make decisions in order to minimise the negative impacts on, say, a patient or the health industry in general. A large amount of research in the biomedical sciences regarding Pharmacogenomics as of late stems from combinatorial chemistry, genomic mining, omic technologies and high throughput screening. In order for the field to grow, rich knowledge enterprises and business must work more closely together and adopt simulation strategies. Consequently, more importance must be placed on the role of computational biology with regards to safety and risk assessments. Here, we can find the growing need and importance of being able to manage large, complex data sets, being able to extract information by integrating disparate data so that developments can be made in improving human health.|$|E

[...] Said Eitan, [...] "From {{the operational}} point of view I can say that we used the mini-RPVs, long before the war, to identify and locate all the Syrian missile batteries. We then used superior electronic devices which <b>enabled</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> [...] "blind" [...] or neutralize the missile sites' ground-to-air radar. We rendered them ineffective to take reliable fixes on our aircraft aloft. But in advance of direct aerial attacks, we used long-range artillery".|$|E
500|$|Jazz drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was {{recommended}} {{by a friend}} of Corgan's. Chamberlin knew little of alternative music and immediately changed {{the sound of the}} nascent band. As Corgan recalled of the period, [...] "We were completely into the sad-rock, Cure kind of thing. It took about two or three practices before I realized that the power in his playing was something that <b>enabled</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> rock harder than we could ever have imagined." [...] On October 5, 1988, the complete band took the stage {{for the first time at}} the Cabaret Metro.|$|E

On performing after the Roskilde tragedy, Vedder said that [...] "playing, facing crowds, being together—it <b>enabled</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> start processing it." [...] On October 22, 2000, the band played the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, celebrating the tenth anniversary of its first live performance as a band. Vedder {{took the opportunity to}} thank the many people who had helped the band come together and make it to ten years. He noted that [...] "I would never do this accepting a Grammy or something." [...] After concluding the Binaural Tour, the band released Touring Band 2000 the following year. The DVD featured select performances from the North American legs of the tour.|$|E
500|$|By the 1950s, {{the prison}} {{conditions}} had improved and prisoners were gradually permitted more privileges {{such as the}} playing of musical instruments, watching movies on weekends, painting, and radio use; the strict code of silence became more relaxed and prisoners were permitted to talk quietly. However, the prison continued to be unpopular on the mainland into the 1950s; it {{was by far the}} most expensive prison institution in the United States and continued to be perceived by many as America's most extreme jail. In his annual report for 1952, director James V. Bennett called for a more centralized institution to replace Alcatraz. A 1959 report indicated that Alcatraz was more than three times more expensive to run than the average US prison; $10 per prisoner per day compared to $3 in most other prisons. The problem of Alcatraz was exacerbated {{by the fact that the}} prison had seriously deteriorated structurally from exposure to the salt air and wind and would need $5 million to fix. Major repairs began in 1958, but by 1961 the prison was evaluated by engineers to be a lost cause and Robert F. Kennedy submitted plans for a new maximum-security institution at Marion, Illinois. After the June 1962 escape from Alcatraz, the prison was the subject of heated investigations, and with the major structural problems and ongoing expense, the prison finally closed on 21 March 1963. The final Bureau of Prisons report said of Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary: [...] "The institution served an important purpose in taking the strain off the older and greatly overcrowded institutions in Atlanta, Leavenworth and McNeil Island since it <b>enabled</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> move to the smaller, closely guarded institution for the escape artists, the big-time racketeers, the inveterate connivers and those who needed protection from other groups." ...|$|E

Much of my time in Canada was spent evading reporters and cameramen, who knew all about my arrival in spite of our efforts to keep it secret, and who frequently became personal when I did not give them a statement.
