5|$|In The Ethnostate, Robertson {{declares}} polyethnicity as {{an ideal}} that only lessens each culture. He believes that, within a polyethnic culture, the nation or region {{as a whole is}} less capable of cultural culmination than each of the individual ethnicities that make it up. Essentially, polyethnicity promotes the dilution of ethnicity and thus hinders each <b>ethnicity</b> <b>in</b> all aspects of culture.|$|E

Christianity plays an important part to the indigenous cultures in the interior side in the daily lives of the Kadazan-Dusun, Lundayeh, Murut and Rungus beside their old practice of the traditional Animism and Paganism. Interracial marriage among the different ethnicity and religion are common in Sabah.|$|E
