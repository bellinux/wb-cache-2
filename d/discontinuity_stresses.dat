The applicable types of pressure vessels include propellant tanks ranging from main load-carrying integral tank structure to small auxiliary tanks, storage tanks, solid propellant motor cases, high pressure gas bottles, and pressurized cabins. The major sources of <b>discontinuity</b> <b>stresses</b> are discussed, including deviations in geometry, material properties, loads, and temperature. The advantages, limitations, and disadvantages of various theoretical and experimental discontinuity analysis methods are summarized.

40|$|A fatigue-resistant {{cladding}} concept {{confirms the}} presence of compressive residual stresses in a cylinder weld clad with 17 - 4 PH stainless steel while tensile residual stresses exist in an Inconel 625 clad layer. In this study, autofrettage of an Inconel 625 thick-walled clad cylinder is investigated with modified residual stress distributions obtained indicating that tensile residual stresses throughout the clad layer are transformed to compressive in nature, <b>discontinuity</b> <b>stresses</b> at the clad/substrate interface are almost entirely eliminated and compressive residual stresses exist {{to a depth of}} around 18 mm. An alternative clad material, 17 - 4 PH stainless steel, is investigated resulting in compressive residual stresses in the clad layer without the need for autofrettage. The complexity of modelling a martensitic stainless steel is discussed and sensitivity studies undertaken to illustrate the influence of coefficient of thermal expansion on resulting residual stresses. Strain hardening effects and the assumption of an idealised interface are discussed. Contour method measurements prove that <b>discontinuity</b> <b>stresses</b> are reduced in reality due to alloying and diffusion effects, highlighting also the need for further characterisation of 17 - 4 PH. Additional considerations such as the weld clad profile and process parameters are briefly discussed...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 This thesis {{deals with}} the effect of {{pressure}} coupling on the stresses in shells having geometric discontinuities. The problems are, 1) cylinder with an axially symmetric thickness change and 2) cylinder with a hemispherical end closure. Solutions to the above problems are based on differential equations that included the straightening effect of the axial tension load. In each of the problems the only load was internal pressure. Our main objective was to obtain curves giving distribution of dimensionless <b>discontinuity</b> <b>stresses</b> for these problems. The problem we have solved first was the cylinder with a thickness change. We first hypothetically separated the cylinders at the thickness change and wrote the differential equations for the individual cylinders. The solutions to the differential equations that {{were thought to be}} of interest have been retained, and the boundary conditions of compatibility and force equilibrium used to evaluate the integration constants. Since the thinner cylinder would be the higher stressed, the emphasis of the analysis was placed on the thinner cylinder, from this point on. Non-dimensionalizing of the interface stress resultants, integration constants, solutions to the differential equations, and stress resultants, to put the results in terms of the minimum number of variables, was accomplished. The dimensionless equations were programed for the IBM 1410 computer and numerical values representing the dimensionless stress curves obtained and these curves were plotted by an IBM 1627 plotter. For the second problem the cylindrical and hemispherical portions were hypothetically separated and the solution for the sphere given by Cline ("Journal of Applied Mechanics", March 1963) has been used for the hemispherical portion and the solution found in the first problem used for the cylindrical portion. Again the boundary conditions of compatibility and force equilibrium enabled us to determine the integration constants. After non-dimensionalizing the interface stress resultants and the integration constants, to put the equations in terms of the minimum number of dimensionless variables, we wrote the non-dimensional stress equations. Again the dimensionless equations were programed for the IBM 1410 computer and the numerical values representing the dimensionless <b>discontinuity</b> <b>stresses</b> obtained and the curves plotted by an IBM 1627 plotter. Dimensionless design curves of the <b>discontinuity</b> <b>stresses,</b> the goal of this thesis, are presented...|$|E

40|$|The interlaminar {{normal stress}} {{distributions}} along {{the interface between}} the + 45 deg and - 45 deg plies of a graphite/epoxy laminate, obtained by various investigators, were found to disagree in both magnitude and sign. The reliability of the displacement-formulated finite element method in analyzing the edge-stress problem of a composite laminate is investigated. The history of the edge-stress problem is reviewed, and two well-known elasticity problems, one involving a <b>stress</b> <b>discontinuity</b> and one a singularity, are analyzed. The finite element analysis in these problems yields accurate stress distributions everywhere except in two elements closest to the <b>stress</b> <b>discontinuity</b> or singularity. <b>Stress</b> distributions for a + or - 45 deg ply laminate near the singularity {{were similar to those}} of the two elasticity problems, demonstrating the methods, accuracy for calculating interlaminar stresses in composite laminates.

40|$|AbstractIn 500 MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR), the Primary Sodium Pump (PSP) {{contained}} in the primary circuit circulates sodium through the core. The PSP is supported on the roof slab. The space between the roof slab and sodium free surface is filled with argon. PSP will be lowered slowly, using a flask, into the main vessel (MV) {{after the completion of}} preheating and sodium filling of the main vessel. Pump inside the flask will be at ambient condition before lower ng into the sodium pool. While lowering PSP into MV sodium, one of the critical welds near the shell-flange junction at the discharge nozzle will experience thermal stress due to the hot shock offered by the sodium. The governing failure mode to ensure the structural integrity of the PSP is the creep damage developed in the weld near the junction of flange due to the <b>discontinuity</b> <b>stresses</b> that would be locked up the weld while lowering. This paper addresses the thermo-mechanical analysis carried out towards establishing the preheating temperature and speed of lowering the pump in the sodium pool. The PSP may be take in out for inspection/maintenance and lowered it back into the sodium pool around 5 - 10 times during the plant life. Based on this investigation, the PSP preheat temperature and lowering rate has been recommended...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a state-of-the-art {{review of literature}} available for the structural assessment {{of all types of}} mitred pipe bends. Compared with smooth bends, the volume of literature available for mitres is less extensive and its scope is not as wide. Historically, this reflects a reduced application level, as well as a less demanding range of applications, such as non-high temperature use. There is also the issue that an analysis of a mitred bend is complicated by <b>discontinuity</b> <b>stresses,</b> as well as those due to cross-section ovalisation. This fact delayed the development of non-linear analysis of mitred bends. Nevertheless, there is now a substantial body of work on mitred bends. This review tabulates and characterises all publications to date in chronological order. The details of experimental specimens are highlighted, with a view to these perhaps providing useful verification data for any future finite element analysis for example. Issues of particular interest to pipework designers are discussed, including the effects of combinations of loading, out-of-circularity, tangent pipe length and flanges. Failure characteristics and loads are discussed where relevant. Topics for further research are also noted. For example, comprehensive design curves do not exist for the elastic and plastic behaviour of all mitre types, over a practical range of geometry and loading parameters. Similarly, there is still scope for further work on the effect of combined loading, end effects and out-of-circularity. Limit, collapse and burst loads are not yet available across the entire spectrum of bends and loading parameters either. Creep and optimisation represent virgin territory as far as mitred bends are concerned and given that unforeseen vibration is a common source of high-cycle fatigue failure in pipework, there must also be scope for vibration-induced fatigue studies...|$|E

We examine the concentration jumps at phase boundaries that result in <b>stress</b> <b>discontinuities,</b> which in turn can cause cracking. The influence of the mechanical properties of the two phases on <b>stress</b> evolution, <b>stress</b> <b>discontinuity,</b> and strain energy are clarified.

40|$|A {{close look}} at the Loyalhanna Limestone of southwestern Pennsylvania reveals a complex {{structural}} environment. Most exposures of the Loyalhanna occur along Chestnut Ridge and LaurelHill within the Allegheny Mountain Section of the Appalachian Plateaus Province. Because the Loyalhanna is rated as a super-pavement aggregate by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and because of its proximity to the population centers of southwestern Pennsylvania, the Loyalhanna has been extensively mined along these prominent anticlinal structures. Geologic and engineering analyses were performed using gas well and core logs, outcrop examinations, underground observations, and mine maps. Strata exposures from both outcrops and quarries were used to construct geologic maps, stereo net, and rose diagram projections so that the Loyalhanna 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s structural environment could be understood better. Many of these structural conditions cause ground control problems at local quarries. These problems ranged from small-to-moderate sized rock falls associated with roof jointing to pillar failures associated with dipping <b>discontinuities.</b> <b>Stresses</b> ranged from tensional on structural domes where weathering dominates, to high levels of compression within structural saddles. A greater understanding of these characteristics is a prerequisite to develop engineering controls, such as improved mine layouts, pillar sizes, etc., that lessen miner exposure to these hazards...|$|R

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of the finite difference method in the solution of linear elasticity problems that involve either a <b>stress</b> <b>discontinuity</b> or a <b>stress</b> singularity is considered. Solutions to three elasticity problems are discussed in detail: a semi-infinite plane subjected to a uniform load over a portion of its boundary; a bimetallic plate under uniform tensile stress; and a long, midplane symmetric, fiber reinforced laminate subjected to uniform axial strain. Finite difference solutions to the three problems are compared with finite element solutions to corresponding problems. For the first problem a comparison with the exact solution is also made. The finite difference formulations for the three problems are based on second order finite difference formulas that provide for variable spacings in two perpendicular directions.

30|$|The seismic moment tensor source can be {{implemented}} in the FDM either by couples of body forces (Graves 1996) or based on a <b>stress</b> <b>discontinuity</b> representation (Coutant et al. 1995; Pitarka 1999). In OpenSWPC, the <b>stress</b> <b>discontinuity</b> representation was adopted to implement the moment tensor sources. The seismic source can {{be implemented}} in OpenSWPC with a single point source. A finite-fault source can be represented using multiple point sources (Graves and Wald 2001; Takenaka and Fujii 2008). In this code, there is no restriction {{on the number of}} point sources; the code automatically detects the number of sources and allocates the required memory. We also implemented a single-force source that is widely used for modeling seismic signals excited in volcanic environments (e.g., Ohminato et al. 1998). Both moment tensor and single-force sources are placed on the nearest grid point of the normal stress component. This source grid point is averaged with the neighboring source grid points if necessary when updating the shear stress and velocity components (Coutant et al. 1995).|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to further {{investigate}} the seismic response of a set of parallel rock fractures filled with viscoelastic materials, following the work by Zhu et al. Dry quartz sands are used to represent the viscoelastic materials. The split Hopkinson rock bar (SHRB) technique is modified to simulate 1 -D P-wave propagation across the sand-filled parallel fractures. At first, the displacement and <b>stress</b> <b>discontinuity</b> model (DSDM) describes the seismic response of a sand-filled single fracture. The modified recursive method (MRM) then predicts the seismic response of the sand-filled parallel fractures. The SHRB tests verify the theoretical predictions by DSDM for the sand-filled single fracture and by MRM for the sand-filled parallel fractures. The filling sands cause <b>stress</b> <b>discontinuity</b> across the fractures and promote displacement discontinuity. The wave transmission coefficient for the sand-filled parallel fractures depends on wave superposition between the fractures, which is similar to the effect of fracture spacing on the wave transmission coefficient for the non-filled parallel fractures...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{considers}} three-dimensional {{analyses of}} fractures and wellbores in low-permeability petroleum/geothermal reservoirs, {{with a special}} emphasis {{on the role of}} coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical processes. Thermoporoelastic displacement <b>discontinuity</b> and <b>stress</b> <b>discontinuity</b> methods are elaborated for infinite media. Furthermore, injection/production-induced mass and heat transport inside fractures are studied by coupling the displacement discontinuity method with the finite element method. The resulting method is then used to simulate problems of interest in wellbores and fractures for related to drilling and stimulation. In the examination of fracture deformation, the nonlinear behavior of discontinuities and the change in status from joint (hydraulically open, mechanically closed) to hydraulic fracture (hydraulically open, mechanically open) are taken into account. Examples are presented to highlight the versatility of the method and the role of thermal and hydraulic effects, three-dimensionality, hydraulic/natural fracture deformation, and induced micro earthquakes. Specifically, injection/extraction operations in enhanced geothermal reservoirs and hydraulic/thermal stimulation of fractured reservoirs are studied and analyzed with reference to induced seismicity. In addition, the fictitious stress method is used to study three-dimensional wellbore stresses {{in the presence of a}} weakness plane. It is shown that the coupling of hydro-thermo-mechanical processes plays a very important role in low-permeability reservoirs and should be considered when predicting the behavior of fractures and wellbores...|$|R

40|$|Nontransform offsets are a {{fundamental}} {{aspect of the}} offset geometry exhibited along the mid-oceanic ridge system, independent of spreading rate. Along the slow/intermediate opening (< 40 mm/y full rate) Mid-Atlantic Ridge these offsets of the ridge axis range in length from less than 10 km to approximately 30 km and vary in age offset from 0. 5 to 2. 0 m. y. The variable morphotectonic geometries associated with these discontinuities indicate that horizontal shear strains are accommodated by both extensional and strike-slip tectonism and that the geometries are unstable in time. In many cases, {{there appears to be}} an evolutionary relationship between transform fault boundaries and nontransform offsets as the result of prolonged differential asymmetric spreading between adjoining ridge segments. The finite element method is used to study the complex stress field associated with these small-offset discontinuities of ridges with slow (30 mm/y) and fast (100 mm/y) total opening rates. A plane stress plate model examines the variation in the horizontal tectonic stress field produced by offsets with different lengths and changes in the ratio of a ridge-normal tensile stress resisting plate separation to a shear stress resisting relative plate motion along the discontinuity. The predicted fault patterns based on the calculated stress field are compared with seafloor observations in terms of the morphotectonic patterns and evolution of nontransform offsets. For a slow spreading rate, the analysis shows that all structural geometries observed can be modeled by a range of offset lengths (5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 km) and by a ridge-normal stress 3 to 5 times greater than the <b>discontinuity</b> shear <b>stress.</b> These findings suggest that nontransform offsets are zones of mechanical weakness relative to the surrounding lithosphere. An offset length between 10 and 20 km is predicted to be the threshold length for maintaining a transform fault geometry. As inferred from ridge axis morphology, {{there seems to be a}} strong link between the magnitude of the stress ratio and the time varying magmatic activity along and between ridge segments. While our models are consistent with a weak <b>discontinuity</b> shear <b>stress</b> relative to the ridge-normal stress to explain the geometries of nontransform offsets of slow-spreading centers, a weaker ridge-normal <b>stress</b> to <b>discontinuity</b> shear <b>stress</b> most closely models the development of an overlapping spreading center geometry, the distinctive geometry of nontransform offsets of spreading centers opening at fast rates. This difference is attributed to magma supply along-axis, relatively continuous for fast-spreading centers and intermittent for slow-spreading centers, and a preexisting zone of mechanical weakness linked to the evolution of nontransform offsets from transform faults on slow-spreading centers...|$|R
40|$|Adaptive mesh {{procedures}} {{are widely used}} in conventional finite element analysis and largely eliminate the tedium of preparing quality grids by hand. This paper describes an adaptive meshing procedure for rigorous lower and upper bound limit analysis with reference to geomechanics. Unlike conventional finite element meshes, the limit analyses procedures incorporate statically and kinematically admissible discontinuities between adjacent elements. These <b>discontinuities</b> permit large <b>stress</b> and velocity jumps over an infinitesimal distance and {{reduce the number of}} elements needed to predict the collapse load accurately. In general, the role of the discontinuities is crucial as their arrangement and distribution has a dramatic influence on the accuracy of the analyses (Chen, 1975). To ensure that the <b>stress</b> <b>discontinuities</b> are positioned optimally in a lower bound grid requires an error estimator and mesh adaptation strategy which account for the presence of singularities in the computed stress field. Similarly, in an upper bound analysis, it is necessary to position the velocity discontinuities so that they capture emerging slip surfaces precisely in the collapse mechanism...|$|R
