40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to determine foaling season effect on delivery size and on Lippizaner foals development in sucking phase. Mares mainly foal in spring months, but some of them also foal in summer and autumn months. The investigations refer to foals being delivered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> period 1 January - 30 June and 1 July to 31 December of the current year. We also studied male foals and females separately. Sixty three males and 50 females were studied in spring period whereas 14 males and 17 females in autumn months. Withers height, chest girth as well as cannon bone circumference were measured after birth and ablactation. Male foals had significantly higher withers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>six</b> <b>month</b> of <b>the</b> year and insignificantly thicker cannon bone compared to female ones. However, no significance was determined with foals being delivered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> Male foals being delevered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>six</b> <b>months</b> had insignificantly larger chest girth and cannon bone circumference compared to the foals being delivered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> Significantly very higher withers height and chest girth were determined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>six</b> <b>month</b> with female foals. Male foals being delivered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>six</b> <b>months</b> did have significantly very higher values for all three measures after ablactation whereas female foals being delivered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of <b>the</b> year had very significantly higher values compared to the male foals. Highly significant values in favour of male foals being delivered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of <b>the</b> year were determined by the testing. However, female foals delivered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of <b>the</b> year had significantly higher values.

5|$|The lactational {{amenorrhea}} method {{involves the}} use of a woman's natural postpartum infertility which occurs after delivery and may be extended by breastfeeding. This usually requires the presence of no periods, exclusively breastfeeding the infant, and a child younger than six months. The World Health Organization states that if breastfeeding is the infant's only source of nutrition, the failure rate is 2% <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> following delivery. Six uncontrolled studies of lactational amenorrhea method users found failure rates at 6 months postpartum between 0% and 7.5%. Failure rates increase to 4–7% at one year and 13% at two years. Feeding formula, pumping instead of nursing, the use of a pacifier, and feeding solids all increase its failure rate. In those who are exclusively breastfeeding, about 10% begin having periods before three months and 20% before six months. In those who are not breastfeeding, fertility may return four weeks after delivery.|$|E

5|$|Toothache {{may occur}} at any age, in any gender {{and in any}} {{geographic}} region. Diagnosing and relieving toothache {{is considered one of}} the main responsibilities of dentists. Irreversible pulpitis is thought to be the most common reason that people seek emergency dental treatment. Since dental caries associated with pulpitis is the most common cause, toothache is more common in populations that are at higher risk of dental caries. The prevalence of caries in a population is dependent upon factors such as diet (refined sugars), socioeconomic status, and exposure to fluoride (such as areas without water fluoridation). In the United States, an estimated 12% of the general population reported that they suffered from toothache at some point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> before questioning. Individuals aged 18–34 reported much higher experience of toothache than those aged 75 or over. In a survey of Australian schoolchildren, 12% had experienced toothache before the age of five, and 32% by the age of 12. Dental trauma is extremely common and tends to occur more often in children than adults.|$|E
