5000|$|Current quota limits {{were reduced}} in 2010 {{to reflect the}} {{vulnerable}} nature of wild stocks. Quotas for the 2010/2011 seasons were reduced to 80% of years previous. The global total allowable catch (TAC) was reduced from 11,810 tonnes from the previously allocated global TAC to 9,449 tonnes. After the quota reduction, Australia had the highest [...] "effective catch limit" [...] with 4,015 tonnes, followed by Japan (2,261), Republic of Korea (859), <b>Fishing</b> <b>Entity</b> of Taiwan (859), New Zealand (709), and Indonesia (651). Fishing pressure outside the allocated global TAC remains a major concern. The Australian government stated in 2006 that Japan had admitted to taking more than 100,000 tonnes over its quota over the previous 20 years. The reduced quotas reflected this, with Japan's cut by half, as supposed punishment for over-fishing.|$|E

40|$|The 1995 UNFSA {{creates a}} door for fishing entities’ {{participation}} in {{conservation and management}} regimes regarding straddling and highly migratory fish stocks through separate RFMOs. However, fishing entities are different from states, leading to some ambiguous circumstances in RFMOs, especially in high seas enforcements. This thesis reviews the concepts of fishing entities and considers fishing entities’ status in international {{law of the sea}} and the RFMOs. Then, it considers the role of <b>fishing</b> <b>entity</b> enforcement in high seas with being equivalent to a flag state and non-flag state. This thesis then considers the problems that fishing entities may encounter in high seas enforcement.

40|$|In the 1970 s, Taiwan {{lost its}} United Nations seat, and most nations {{switched}} diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the People 2 ̆ 7 s Republic of China (PRC). The loss of Taiwan 2 ̆ 7 s diplomatic recognition became a fundamental issue in judicial proceedings. Contrary to the PRC 2 ̆ 7 s claim, the article argues that, {{from the viewpoint}} of international law, Taiwan has never been succeeded by the PRC. The article explores the Taiwan question faced by foreign courts and finds that, albeit the lack of diplomatic recognition, the courts around the world have almost uniformly accorded Taiwan the status of state and this judicial recognition has risen to the level of customary international law. As for the standing of Taiwan before the international courts, the article analyzes whether Taiwan, as a non-UN member, may be granted standing before the International Court of Justice. The article also argues that Taiwan, as a <b>fishing</b> <b>entity,</b> has the right to access the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. Furthermore, Taiwan 2 ̆ 7 s status as a separate customs territory in the World Trade Organization enables the nation to utilize the dispute settlement mechanism. The article concludes that, to avoid the judicial black hole in terms of global justice, it is both necessary and pragmatic to deem Taiwan a state in all judicial proceedings...|$|E

40|$|IUU fishing {{has become}} a lucrative {{business}} activity for highly organised <b>fishing</b> <b>entities.</b> Whilst the 1990 s were shaped by recognition of the increasing problem of IUU fishing and the formulation of international responses, the new millennium has witnessed {{a shift in the}} character of the IUU fishery. Corporate entities have long been involved in marine fisheries. However, a criminal element, characterised by a demonstrated commitment to evading international, regional and national laws, {{has become a}}pparent in recent years. Fishing grounds in the Southern Ocean have been particularly hard hit by IUU fishing. Remote and hostile seas, practical difficulties associated with conducting surveillance in such seas and the perceived low risk of detection have combined to produce an environment conducive to IUU fishing. Low penalties and high returns have further encouraged IUU fishers to the Southern Ocean. The availability of high economic returns in a low-risk environment has attracted the entry of corporate criminals into IUU fishing. This paper reviews the evidence relating to arrested IUU vessels in the Southern Ocean and concludes that their practice is increasingly corporate and increasingly criminal. ...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{provides}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} status of the Republic of China on Taiwan in foreign and international settings. Most existing literature written from the traditional public international law perspective focuses on Taiwan 2 ̆ 7 s separate statehood from China. This Article addresses an important pragmatic issue that international courts and courts in foreign countries frequently face: whether Taiwan is a 2 ̆ 2 foreign State 2 ̆ 2 for particular salutatory purposes in judicial proceedings. Part I of this Article {{provides a}}n overview of China-Taiwan relations and the status of Taiwan under international law. I argue that the ROC on Taiwan has been a sovereign State since its creation in 1912 and was never 2 ̆ 2 succeeded 2 ̆ 2 by the PRC, which was established in 1949. By my analysis, both the ROC and the PRC are equal entities in the 2 ̆ 2 divided China 2 ̆ 2; neither side belongs to the other. Part II examines the decisions of domestic courts that have addressed the status of Taiwan in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan. In these countries (which do not recognize Taiwan as an autonomous entity, but nonetheless maintain substantial 2 ̆ 2 non-official 2 ̆ 2 ties with it), domestic courts have employed various devices to ensure the State-like status of Taiwan, thus safeguarding the country 2 ̆ 7 s interests and allowing continued economic and diplomatic relations with the ROC. Consequently, judicial recognition of Taiwan 2 ̆ 7 s existence as a State has risen to the level of customary international law. Part III explores the possibility of Taiwan bringing suit as a 2 ̆ 2 State 2 ̆ 2 before the International Court of Justice, as a 2 ̆ 2 <b>fishing</b> <b>entity</b> 2 ̆ 2 before the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, and as a 2 ̆ 2 separate customs territory 2 ̆ 2 in the dispute resolution mechanism of the World Trade Organization. This Article concludes that to avoid creating a global judicial 2 ̆ 2 black hole, 2 ̆ 2 it is both necessary and pragmatic to officially deem Taiwan a State in judicial proceedings of any kind...|$|E
40|$|The European Union (EU) {{is today}} the world’s third largest <b>fishing</b> <b>entity</b> (surpassed only by China and Peru), with over seven {{million tons of}} fish landed in 2001. Denmark and Spain, the two main fishing {{countries}} in the EU, land about one million tons of fish annually and employ more than one-quarter of the sector’s workforce (more than 150, 000 persons). Furthermore, the EU fishing fleet had more than 90, 000 ships in 2002 {{and the number of}} people employed in its fishing industry (including aquaculture, fish processing, marketing, supply, and shipbuilding) in 1997 was over half a million persons. The fishing industry is therefore essential for the socio-economic life of coastal regions in the EU. Regulating fishing activity in order to maintain fishery resources at a bio-sustainable level {{while at the same time}} ensuring that fishing continues to be an economically viable enterprise for coastal populations is a major issue confronting the European Union, especially in light of the fact that the EU lacks abundant fishery resources. The Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union was adopted in 1983, although its major principles had been in place since 1970. According to the ideas prevailing at that time, the depletion of fish stocks necessitated the introduction of a fisheries management system in order to determine conditions for access to fisheries and the rights to be accorded to those granted access. Despite this perceived necessity, EU member states needed an additional thirteen years to accept a transfer, to the EU, of their powers regarding the conservation and management of the resources within waters previously subject to their national jurisdiction. The EU also needed this time to figure out how to deal with the disruption of international fisheries law (e. g., the displacement of the traditional regime of fishing on the high seas with the concept of the Exclusive Economic Zone) and the impact of EU enlargement to northern European countries (the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Denmark became EU members in 1973). Particular thorny problems related to EU enlargement involved conflicts concerning access to particular waters, raising questions of historic rights. The development and implementation of a common fisheries policy was not the result of unanimous agreement on a particular approach. What is now regarded as a community asset only came to be so regarded after ceaseless diplomatic efforts, made necessary by numerous and important economic and political changes. At first these efforts were not successful. The complex and laborious compromises that marked the first two decades of the Common Fisheries Policy failed to achieve the dual goals of biosustainability and economic viability. It appears, however, that meaningful reform finally occurred in 2002, and that the Common Fisheries Policy has attained a maturity that will allow it to manage effectively the challenges faced by EU fisheries and the EU fishing industry...|$|E
50|$|The WCPF Convention {{was built}} on the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement, and set out to address the {{specific}} characteristics of the western and central Pacific Ocean. It established a framework for the participation of <b>fishing</b> <b>entities</b> which legally binds them to the provisions of the Convention. Territories and possessions can participate {{in the work of the}} Commission, which is also mandated to cooperate with fisheries in other regions if the area of competence overlaps with WCPFC. Cooperation with the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission is of particular importance because of the overlap in respective Convention Areas and the wide range of some of the stocks (such as Bigeye tuna, and the two Albacore Tuna stocks) jointly managed by WCPFC and IATTC. The High Seas of the WCPFC Convention Area also overlap significantly with the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation and the new North Pacific Fisheries Commission Convention Area. However the fish stocks managed by these RFMOs are different from those managed by WCPFC, and interactions are likely to be restricted to those involving bycatch and multipurpose vessels.|$|R

40|$|The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) is a {{regional}} fisheries management organization (RFMO) comprised of over fifty cooperating states and <b>fishing</b> <b>entities.</b> It manages Northern Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Due to overfishing and ineffective management, the stock abundance {{of this species}} has declined to about thirty percent of its unfished biomass in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Many publications point to this poor stock status as evidence of failed fisheries management. To maintain bluefin tuna stocks {{at a level that}} can support maximum sustainable yield (MSY), ICCAT has implemented unique tools to manage this important fishery, {{which is one of the}} oldest-recorded in the world. ^ In this thesis research, I examine the factors that contribute to the tools utilized to manage the fishery in the ICCAT Convention Area to shed light on why they are managed differently than other ICCAT stocks. To do this, I conducted a literature review on publicly available ICCAT reports, governmental and non-governmental documents, peer reviewed scientific literature, and other sources to understand and explain the relevant importance of each contributing factor to the management of the species. I utilized key informant interview methodology to obtain insights from twelve bluefin tuna experts representing a variety of interests that attend ICCAT official meetings. I transcribed and collected insights from semi-structured interviews, which I used to ground-truth the findings of the literature review. ^ No single factor is responsible for the unique management in place to govern ICCAT 2 ̆ 7 s bluefin tuna fishery. Rather, a nuanced interaction of many important factors contributes to the species 2 ̆ 7 poor stock status and unique management. The history and complex nature of the fishery, unique biology of the species, strong demand in the world sushi market, impact of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, and political will of ICCAT member countries to enforce Recommendations and Resolutions influence which measures are adopted and implemented. This finding contrasts peer reviewed literature and other information to the contrary that attribute the unique management and poor stock status of bluefin tuna to such factors as high market value of the species 2 ̆ 7 meat, ineffective ICCAT management, Hardin 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Tragedy of the Commons, 2 ̆ 2 or the 2 ̆ 2 free riding 2 ̆ 2 of non-cooperating <b>fishing</b> <b>entities</b> fully. ^ Based on key informant interviews, expert respondents share a high level of agreement that the special, 2 ̆ 2 iconic 2 ̆ 2 status that bluefin tuna have attained in popular media, scientific publications, and in general public opinion are important factors that contribute to their management. Further, experts mostly agree that more scientific research on the biology and life history of the species needs to be conducted to inform more effective and appropriate management such as updating the current two-stock management framework. Experts recommend that ICCAT prioritize setting Total Allowable Catch (TAC) Recommendations based on the advice of their Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) to sustain healthy stocks. This thesis research provides analyses of these various forces and the management context of the species, and shares recommendations for improving bluefin tuna management. ...|$|R

Compiled by Stefani J. Evers and Ann L. Shriver. International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), Corvallis, 2016. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. Each year, over 20, 000 {{metric tons}} of tuna are {{supplied}} to the Japanese market, of which 40 % are caught by domestic vessels.  Although the Japanese tuna market is large, {{little is known about}} the supply chain and the Japanese tuna fisheries’ behaviors. In this study, we investigate how Bluefin tuna are caught in Japanese EEZs and brought to consumers. To do this, we use the reported landings data, central wholesale market data, and conduct interviews. To represent the qualitative information gathered via the interviews and to complement the quantitative analysis, we develop a model of migrating fish stocks with multiple <b>fishing</b> <b>entities.</b> We identify that Bluefin tunas are caught mainly by pole-and-line, purse-seine, set-net, and long-line fishermen in 22 prefectures at 36 ports. Region and gear-based fishing cooperative associations manage fishing activities, and each group differs in its management goals and strategies. In recent years, this has led to conflicts among Bluefin tuna fishermen who target tunas that spawn in the Sea of Japan. Though the formal scientific evidence is incomplete, some groups of fishermen blame the decline in their catch on the purse-seiners for catching too many young tunas, hence causing a decline in domestic tuna stocks.   The nature of the problem stems from a lack of consensus among fishermen on the science related to tuna stock management. Furthermore, our preliminary findings indicate that an introduction of Bluefin tuna aquaculture creates a market for live infant Bluefin, which reshapes domestic Bluefin tuna fisheries and their markets...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{make and}} use classifications is human; {{at least in}} the {{discovery}} sciences, these activities involve high degrees of uncertainty. Drawing on ethnography and conversation analysis of videotaped scientists, the activities of classifying and making classifications are analyzed considering four types of situations that arise when there is certainty or uncertainty about the object to be classified and the classification scheme to be used. For example, a group of scientists may be able to make perceptual distinctions between <b>entities</b> (<b>fish</b> or photoreceptors) without being able to provide an operational definition for making such distinctions. As a collection, the different analyses of everyday scientific work articulate classification as a physically and temporally situated and socially distributed activity that does not achieve to eliminate uncertainty and inconsistency but tends to minimize contradiction.

40|$|Ependymoblastoma (EBL) and {{embryonal}} tumor with abundant neuropil {{and true}} rosettes (ETANTR) are very aggressive embryonal neoplasms {{characterized by the}} presence of ependymoblastic multilayered rosettes typically occurring in children below 6 years of age. It has not been established whether these two tumors really comprise distinct entities. Earlier, using array-CGH, we identified a unique focal amplification at 19 q 13. 42 in a case of ETANTR. In the present study, we investigated this locus by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 41 tumors, which had morphologically been diagnosed as EBL or ETANTR. Strikingly, FISH analysis revealed 19 q 13. 42 amplifications in 37 / 40 samples (93 %). Among tumors harboring the amplification, 19 samples were identified as ETANTR and 18 as EBL. The three remaining tumors showed a polysomy of chromosome 19. Analysis of recurrent/metastatic tumors (n = 7) showed that the proportion of nuclei carrying the amplification was increased (up to 80 - 100 % of nuclei) in comparison to the corresponding primary tumors. In conclusion, we have identified a hallmark cytogenetic aberration occurring in virtually all embryonal brain tumors with ependymoblastic rosettes suggesting that ETANTR and EBL comprise a single biological <b>entity.</b> <b>FISH</b> analysis of the 19 q 13. 42 locus is a very promising diagnostic tool to identify a subset of primitive neuroectodermal tumors with distinct morphology, biology, and clinical behavior...|$|R
40|$|Aim: This study {{attempted}} to distinguish primary bladder adenocarcinoma (PBA) from metastatic colonic adenocarcinomas (MCA), {{which is a}} difficult diagnostic and clinical problem. Methods: Twenty-four cases of bladder adenocarcinomas (12 primary & 12 metastatic colorectal) {{were included in the}} study with urothelial carcinoma (UC) and colonic adenocarcinoma (CA) as controls. A panel of immunohistochemical (IHC) stains along with fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), using the UroVysion probe set, was performed. Results: The majority of the PBAs presented with advanced disease. Enteric histologic subtype was the most common morphological variant. Strong nuclear with cytoplasmic-membranous staining of β-catenin was seen in 75 % of MCA and only 16. 7 % PBA (< 10 % staining cells). Although abnormal nuclear staining with E-cadherin was seen in both PBA and MCA, it was more frequent in former. CK- 7, CK- 20, villin and CDX- 2 stains were not helpful in distinguishing the two <b>entities.</b> <b>FISH</b> did not reveal any unique differences in chromosomal abnormality between the two groups. Conclusion: Although there was a statistically significant difference in β-catenin and E-cadherin staining between two groups, we did not find any IHC or FISH marker that was specific for PBA. Distinction between PBA and MCA remains a diagnostic problem and clinical correlation is vital before rendering a diagnosis.
