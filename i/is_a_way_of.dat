5|$|Traditionally, {{religious}} {{language has}} been explained as via negativa, analogy, symbolism, or myth, {{each of which}} describes a way of talking about God in human terms. The via negativa <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> referring to God according to what God is not; analogy uses human qualities as standards against which to compare divine qualities; symbolism is used non-literally to describe otherwise ineffable experiences; and a mythological interpretation of religion attempts to reveal fundamental truths behind religious stories. Alternative explanations of religious language cast it as having political, performative, or imperative functions.|$|E
5|$|The fifth book {{returns to}} the subject of faith. Clement argues that truth, justice and {{goodness}} can be seen only by the mind, not the eye; faith <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> accessing the unseeable. He stresses that knowledge of God can only be achieved through faith once one's moral faults have been corrected. This parallels Clement's earlier insistence that martyrdom can only be achieved by those who practice their faith in Christ through good deeds, not those who simply profess their faith. God transcends matter entirely, and thus the materialist cannot truly come to know God. Although Christ was God incarnate, it is our spiritual, not physical comprehension of him which is important.|$|E

25|$|Fidelity to {{tradition}} is absolutely not {{a way of}} imprisoning himself in his own culture; on the contrary, for Prigent, developing the Breton culture by adapting it to modern technology <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> opening up to other cultures.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} particle Reynolds {{number of}} interest is called the boundary Reynolds number, and it is formed by replacing the velocity term in the Particle Reynolds number by the shear velocity, , which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> rewriting shear stress in terms of velocity.|$|E

50|$|The term can <b>be</b> seen as <b>an</b> {{invitation}} to invite parallels {{with the idea}} of a social contract between workers, employers and the state which underpinned the foundation of the welfare state. Some have argued that, just as the social contract <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> addressing social dislocation, so the environmental contract can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> addressing the environmental impacts which pose a threat to people and the planet in the 21st century.|$|R

It is a fundamental process that affects ways of socialization, conformity, leadership and social change.|$|E
25|$|Often the {{deviation}} caused by seam is not {{large enough to}} cause a batsman significant problems with playing the ball. Occasionally, however, the ball can deviate far enough to hit {{the edge of the}} cricket bat instead of the middle, producing a catch for nearby fielders.

25|$|Like the {{statistical}} mean and median, the mode <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> expressing, in a (usually) single number, important {{information about a}} random variable or a population.

25|$|Critical {{understanding}} is a cerebral mode of comprehension, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> thinking, {{and thus is}} not dependent upon external expression. Yet it requires external manifestation {{in order to be}} communicated. The expression of critical understanding can take various forms including formal or informal speech, academic writing, creative prose or poetry or visual outcomes. It can take different forms in different cultures and this needs to be taken into consideration when assessing critical results.|$|E
25|$|Divide {{and conquer}} is a {{powerful}} tool for solving conceptually difficult problems: all it requires <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> breaking the problem into sub-problems, of solving the trivial cases and of combining sub-problems to the original problem. Similarly, divide and conquer only requires reducing the problem to a single smaller problem, such as the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle, which reduces moving a tower of height n to moving a tower of height n−1.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{relations}} with surfaces and smooth 4-dimensional topology. For example, under certain assumptions, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> modifying a smooth 4-manifold by performing a surgery {{that consists of}} removing a neighborhood of a two-dimensional torus {{and replacing it with}} a knot complement crossed with S1. The result is a smooth 4-manifold homeomorphic to the original, though now the Seiberg–Witten invariant has been modified by multiplication with the Alexander polynomial of the knot.|$|E

25|$|A scrum <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> {{restarting}} {{the game}} safely and fairly after a minor infringement. It is awarded {{when the ball}} has been knocked or passed forward, when a player is accidentally offside, or when the ball is trapped in a ruck or maul with no realistic chance of being retrieved. A team may also opt for a scrum if awarded a penalty. It is also awarded to the passing or kicking team if the ball hits the referee.|$|E
25|$|Intuitively, then, the {{stereographic}} projection <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> picturing the sphere as the plane, with some inevitable compromises. Because the sphere {{and the plane}} appear {{in many areas of}} mathematics and its applications, so does the {{stereographic projection}}; it finds use in diverse fields including complex analysis, cartography, geology, and photography. In practice, the projection is carried out by computer or by hand using a special kind of graph paper called a stereographic net, shortened to stereonet, or Wulff net.|$|E

Each time someone posts a comment to a participating website, Akismet checks it {{against all the}} comments in the database. If it's spam, it's deleted. If spam gets through and a user marks it as spam, the comment {{is added to the}} database so the pool of spam comments widens, making Akismet increasingly effective over time.|$|E
