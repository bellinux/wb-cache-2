5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by the target audience. One thing the localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E

500|$|The art {{style for}} the game {{was based on the}} work of Frank Frazetta and {{inspired}} by heavy metal and rock album covers. The team only considered the addition of elements to the artwork if they felt <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> that could be seen on such covers. The setting includes hot rod-like engines that grow from the earth like a [...] "V8 Truffle Of Speed", with design inspired by the designs of Ed [...] "Big Daddy" [...] Roth. The art team wanted to avoid creating [...] "another brown-gray game", and strove to use the wide color palettes that are associated with heavy metal art. Cutscenes in the game use the game's engine, though some pre-recorded scenes from the engine have also been prepared with the help of Tasha Harris, a former Pixar employee who helped to animate character's faces during cutscenes.|$|E

500|$|Tali's unmasked {{face and}} its {{potential}} appearance {{have been subject to}} discussion by both critics and fans. Casey Hudson, in an interview, acknowledged depictions of Tali's face as the most common fan art. Jordan Boughman, writing for GamesRadar, highlighted a piece of fan art that he enjoyed and which a BioWare developer had retweeted. Before the face was revealed, IGN's Scott Nichols ran an article about the possibility of revealing the face, concluding that fans did not just want to see her face but also [...] "the expressions it can make, adding yet another level of emotional depth and complexity to a fan favorite character". GamesRadar's Mikel Reparaz listed it as one of the 12 gaming mysteries he wanted solved in 2011, and hoped that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> unusual-looking; this sentiment was echoed by fellow GamesRadar writer Tyler Nagata, who felt that the face should be ugly. PC Gamer's Tom Francis also included the face in their list of 15 things he wanted to see in Mass Effect 3.|$|E
500|$|Monica Herrera from Billboard {{magazine}} {{criticized the}} song for its demonstration of overly processed vocals noting how easily an artist can [...] "get {{lost in a}} sea of auto-tone". She went on to state that it [...] "make it hard to tell whether the California party girl can actually sing". Robert Copsey of Digital Spy met the song with a mixed review. He commented on the choice of the single, noting [...] "the glimpses of emotion shown on her last offering, 'Your Love Is My Drug', are as long gone as her sobriety." [...] Although he was not completely convinced he wrote, [...] " [...] the vocals are more processed than a cheese string [...] the combination of a playful nursery rhyme hook and Dr Luke's bubblegummy electro production make this a pretty irresistible little dancefloor ditty." [...] He went on to give the single three out of five stars. Fraser McAlpine of BBC met the song with a mixed review giving the song three out of five stars. Fraser criticized the choice of the song commenting, [...] "there's a fear that if Kesha reveals that she's a sensitive young flower after all, with real feelings and a good, pure heart, her appeal with disappear like a soap bubble on a cactus, can it?". Nate Adams of No Ripcord was negative in his review of the song, calling it [...] "outright stupid" [...] and noted <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> commonly heard on a playground. Adams wrote that the song touched on opposite-sex objectification, but wrote that the theme became wearisome on the album, using the song as one of the examples where the theme was overused.|$|E
2500|$|At a 1997 [...] "Special Edition" [...] press conference, Lucas said: [...] "Everyone said, 'Well, are {{you going}} to do sequels to the first three?' But that was an afterthought; I don't have scripts on those stories. The only notion on that was, wouldn't it be fun to get all the actors to come back when they're 60 or 70 years old and make three more about them as old people." [...] In a 1997 issue of Star Wars Insider, he said: [...] "The whole story has six episodes.... If I ever went beyond that, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> that was made up. I really don't have any notion other than, 'Gee, it would be {{interesting}} to do Luke Skywalker later on.' It wouldn't be part of the main story, but a sequel to this thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Series {{developers}} Al Gough and Miles Millar {{wanted to}} set up Lex’s [...] "mental illness" [...] early in the season, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> that Lionel would take advantage of in later episodes of season three. In order to accomplish what they wanted, Gough and Millar introduced Lex’s imaginary friend [...] "Louis", who appeared on the deserted island with Lex following his plane crash in the season two finale. They had Rosenbaum pull what they {{referred to as the}} [...] "Fight Club gag", where he believes that he is fighting Louis, but in reality he has been fighting himself the entire time. This would culminate in the episode [...] "Shattered", where, as Mark Verheiden explains, the episode was set up like something out of the film Gaslight, where the audience believes that Lex is being driven insane.|$|E

5000|$|Herbert London {{has defined}} pre-emptive declinism as a postmodern belief [...] "that the United States {{is not an}} {{exceptional}} nation and is not entitled by virtue of history {{to play a role}} on the world stage different from other nations". London ascribed the view to Paul Krugman, among others. Krugman had written in The New York Times that [...] "We have always known that America's reign as the world's greatest nation would eventually end. However, most of us imagined that our downfall, when <b>it</b> came, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> grand and tragic." ...|$|R
