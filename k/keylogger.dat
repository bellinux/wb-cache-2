5|$|Announced September 8, 2003, version 2004 adds adware, spyware, and <b>keylogger</b> {{protection}}. PC Magazine {{found the}} added protection to be weak. Out of the spyware samples Norton detected, {{a significant number}} were not removed completely, requiring manual removal. Norton also did little to prevent spyware infections.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, an unofficial, high-definition remake was {{announced}} titled Sonic the Hedgehog 2 HD, which included development members {{who would later}} work on Sonic Mania. In 2012, {{it was reported that}} a potential <b>keylogger</b> was included with an alpha build of the game, which led to the project being discontinued due to the controversy. In 2014, the project was restarted under a new development team. The final version is planned to feature additional stages and the option to play levels as Knuckles the Echidna.|$|E
25|$|One {{student was}} caught trying to remove an {{electronic}} monitoring device (a hardware <b>keylogger)</b> {{from a school}} computer on October 24, 2007. Another student was caught trying {{to break into the}} school earlier that day, and the third was found waiting in a nearby car.|$|E
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of countermeasures varies, because <b>keyloggers</b> {{use a variety}} of techniques to capture data and the countermeasure needs to be effective against the particular data capture technique. In the case of Windows 10 keylogging from Microsoft it is enough to change some privacy settings on your computer. For example, an on-screen keyboard will be effective against hardware <b>keyloggers,</b> transparency will defeat some—but not all—screenloggers and an anti-spyware application that can only disable hook-based <b>keyloggers</b> will be ineffective against kernel-based <b>keyloggers.</b>|$|R
50|$|This type of {{software}} {{is a rather}} widespread one, but {{it has its own}} drawbacks The biggest drawback of signature-based anti-keyloggers is that one can only be protected from <b>keyloggers</b> found on the signature-base list, thus staying vulnerable to unknown or unrecognized <b>keyloggers.</b> A criminal can download one of many famous <b>keyloggers,</b> change it just enough, and the anti-keylogger won't recognize it.|$|R
50|$|No {{software-based}} anti-spyware application can be 100% {{effective against}} all keyloggers.Also, software-based anti-spyware cannot defeat non-software <b>keyloggers</b> (for example, hardware <b>keyloggers</b> attached to keyboards will always receive keystrokes before any software-based anti-spyware application).|$|R
25|$|Keyloggers are {{sometimes}} part of malware packages downloaded onto computers without the owners' knowledge. Some <b>keylogger</b> software is freely {{available on the}} internet, while others are commercial or private applications. Most keyloggers allow not only keyboard keystrokes to be captured, they also are often capable of collecting screen captures from the computer.|$|E
25|$|Keystroke logging can be {{achieved}} by both hardware and software means. Hardware key loggers are attached to the keyboard cable or installed inside standard keyboards. Software keyloggers work on the target computer's operating system and gain unauthorized access to the hardware, hook into the keyboard with functions provided by the OS, or use remote access software to transmit recorded data out of the target computer to a remote location. Some hackers also use wireless <b>keylogger</b> sniffers to collect packets of data being transferred from a wireless keyboard and its receiver, and then they crack the encryption key being used to secure wireless communications between the two devices.|$|E
500|$|Symantec, in {{compliance}} with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), whitelisted Magic Lantern, a <b>keylogger</b> actively developed by the FBI. The purpose of Magic Lantern is to obtain passwords to encrypted e-mail as part of a criminal investigation. Magic Lantern was first reported in the media by Bob Sullivan of MSNBC on [...] November 20, 2001 and by Ted Bridis of the Associated Press. Magic Lantern is deployed as an e-mail attachment. When the attachment is opened, a trojan horse is installed on the suspect's computer. The Trojan horse is activated when the suspect uses PGP encryption, often used to increase the security of sent e-mail messages. When activated, the trojan horse will log the PGP password, which allows the FBI to decrypt user communications. Symantec and other major antivirus vendors have whitelisted Magic Lantern, rendering their antivirus products, including Norton Internet Security, incapable of detecting it. Concerns include uncertainties about Magic Lantern's full potential and whether hackers could subvert it for purposes outside the jurisdiction of the law.|$|E
5|$|In PC Magazine testing, Norton removed most {{traces of}} 40 {{percent of the}} malware. On a similar test, {{specifically}} using commercial <b>keyloggers,</b> Norton was able to remove most of the <b>keyloggers,</b> beating other tested products. Norton blocked all attempts to install malware on a clean system. Modifications made to the samples did not fool Norton. Norton {{was not able to}} block the installation of all the commercial <b>keyloggers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hardware <b>keyloggers</b> have an {{advantage}} over software <b>keyloggers</b> as they can begin logging from the moment a computer is turned on (and are therefore able to intercept passwords for the BIOS or disk encryption software).|$|R
40|$|<b>Keyloggers</b> as {{invisible}} keystroke recorders have posed {{a serious}} threat to user privacy and security. It is difficult to detect <b>keyloggers,</b> especially kernel <b>keyloggers</b> that operate at the operating system’s kernel level, because of their inconspicuous activities and flexible interception methods. In this paper, we propose a framework using a dynamic taint analysis technique to detect kernel level <b>keyloggers.</b> Our design is originated from the observation that kernel <b>keyloggers</b> usually manipulate the data flow of a keyboard driver in order to record typed keystrokes. By tainting and monitoring the keystroke data, this framework detects and analyzes any illegitimate uses of the tainted keystroke data. Based on Argos, a system that can perform host-based intrusion detection and support dynamic taint analysis, we build a prototype of the proposed framework and evaluate its effectiveness. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework can accurately detect kernel level keylogging activities and identify their root causes. ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{a second}} case, brought against CyberSpy Software LLC, the FTC charged that CyberSpy marketed and sold [...] "RemoteSpy" [...] <b>keylogger</b> spyware to clients who would then {{secretly}} monitor unsuspecting consumers' computers. According to the FTC, Cyberspy touted RemoteSpy as a [...] "100% undetectable" [...] way to [...] "Spy on Anyone. From Anywhere." [...] The FTC has obtained a temporary order prohibiting the defendants from selling {{the software and}} disconnecting from the Internet any of their servers that collect, store, or provide access to information that this software has gathered. The case {{is still in its}} preliminary stages. [...] A complaint filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) brought the RemoteSpy software to the FTC's attention.|$|E
2500|$|Most spyware is {{installed}} without [...] knowledge, or by using deceptive tactics. [...] Spyware {{may try to}} deceive users by bundling itself with desirable software. [...] Other common tactics are using a Trojan horse, spy gadgets that look like normal devices but {{turn out to be}} something else, such as a USB <b>Keylogger.</b> These devices actually are connected to the device as memory units but are capable of recording each stroke made on the keyboard. Some spyware authors infect a system through security holes in the Web browser or in other software. When the user navigates to a Web page controlled by the spyware author, the page contains code which attacks the browser and forces the download and installation of spyware.|$|E
2500|$|Anti-spyware {{applications}} {{are able to}} detect many keyloggers and cleanse them. Responsible vendors of monitoring software support detection by anti-spyware programs, thus preventing abuse of the software. Enabling a firewall does not stop keyloggers per se, but can possibly prevent transmission of the logged material over the net if properly configured. Network monitors (also known as reverse-firewalls) {{can be used to}} alert the user whenever an application attempts to make a network connection. This gives the user the chance to prevent the <b>keylogger</b> from [...] "phoning home" [...] with his or her typed information. Automatic form-filling programs can prevent keylogging entirely by not using the keyboard at all. Most keyloggers can be fooled by alternating between typing the login credentials and typing characters somewhere else in the focus window.|$|E

5|$|In PC Magazine testing, Norton {{detected}} 15 of 16 spyware samples. 13 of the 16 were removed. Against eight commercial <b>keyloggers,</b> {{the suite}} removed all the samples. On a clean system, Norton blocked 14 of the 16 spyware samples from installing, and stopped {{seven of the}} eight <b>keyloggers</b> from installing.|$|R
50|$|Other {{methods include}} email {{vulnerability}}, vulnerability at the domain-registration level, <b>keyloggers,</b> and phishing sites.|$|R
5000|$|API-based: These keyloggers hook {{keyboard}} APIs {{inside a}} running application. The <b>keylogger</b> registers keystroke events, {{as if it}} was a normal piece of the application instead of malware. The <b>keylogger</b> receives an event each time the user presses or releases a key. The <b>keylogger</b> simply records it.|$|E

50|$|The {{main risk}} {{associated}} with <b>keylogger</b> use is that physical access is needed twice: initially to install the <b>keylogger,</b> and secondly to retrieve it. Thus, if the victim discovers the <b>keylogger,</b> they can then set up a sting operation to catch {{the person in the}} act of retrieving it. This could include camera surveillance or the review of access card swipe records to determine who gained physical access to the area during the time period that the <b>keylogger</b> was removed.|$|E
50|$|The suite had {{an overall}} malware {{detection}} rate of 83% {{giving it a}} total score of 7.0 out of 10. It detected 100% of rootkits, 93% of <b>keyloggers</b> and 89% of scareware.The suite had an overall malware blocking rate of 91% with an overall score of 9.0 out of 10. It detected 100% of commercial <b>keyloggers</b> and rootkits and 89% blocking rate on scareware.|$|R
50|$|It {{analyzes}} {{the methods of}} work of all the modules in a PC, thus blocking the activity of any module {{that is similar to}} the work of <b>keyloggers.</b> Though this method gives better keylogging protection than signature-based anti-keyloggers, it has its own drawbacks. One of them is that this type of software blocks non-keyloggers also. Several 'non-harmful' software modules, either part of the operating system or part of legitimate apps, use processes which <b>keyloggers</b> also use, which can trigger a false positive. Usually all the non signature-based <b>keyloggers</b> have the option to allow the user to unblock selected modules, but this can cause difficulties for inexperienced users who are unable to discern good modules from bad modules when maually choosing to block or unblock.|$|R
50|$|Hardware-based <b>keyloggers</b> do {{not depend}} upon any {{software}} being installed as they exist at a hardware {{level in a}} computer system.|$|R
50|$|An anti <b>keylogger</b> is a {{piece of}} {{software}} specifically designed to detect keyloggers on a computer, typically comparing all files in the computer against a database of keyloggers looking for similarities which might signal the presence of a hidden <b>keylogger.</b> As anti keyloggers have been designed specifically to detect keyloggers, they have the potential to be more effective than conventional anti virus software; some anti virus software does not consider a <b>keylogger</b> to be a virus, as under some circumstances a <b>keylogger</b> can be considered a legitimate piece of software.|$|E

50|$|On 11 May 2017 news {{appeared}} that security researchers discovered that Conexant's audio drivers were installing <b>keylogger</b> software, including many laptops sold by HP. The <b>keylogger</b> writes every single keystroke typed by a user (including passwords) and stores {{them in an}} unencrypted file on the user's computer.|$|E

5|$|The {{installation}} {{was noted}} as lengthy by PC Magazine, especially on malware-infected systems. Spyware detection has been tweaked {{since the last}} release. It has been updated to better identify <b>keyloggers.</b> In PC Magazine testing, Norton successfully detected all 11 spyware threats and removed all but two. PC Magazine did give Norton credit even when manual removal was required. The suite also removed three of four commercial <b>keyloggers.</b> When attempting to install the spyware on a clean system, Norton blocked all 11 {{and two of the}} four commercial <b>keyloggers.</b> In most cases, it did not block the installation, however Norton did call for a scan after the spyware was installed. In PC Pro testing, Norton detected 78 percent of spyware, removed 82 percent, and blocked 65 percent from installing.|$|R

50|$|However, the {{particular}} technique that the anti-spyware application uses will influence its potential effectiveness against software keyloggers. As a general rule, anti-spyware applications with higher privileges will defeat keyloggers with lower privileges. For example, a hook-based anti-spyware application cannot defeat a kernel-based <b>keylogger</b> (as the <b>keylogger</b> {{will receive the}} keystroke messages before the anti-spyware application), but it could potentially defeat hook- and API-based keyloggers.|$|E

Norton found and removed all the commercial <b>keyloggers.</b> A full scan took nearly an hour to complete though, {{twice as long as}} the 2007 version. The suite blocked most of the malware from installing and all the commercial <b>keyloggers,</b> regardless of any modifications made to the samples.
