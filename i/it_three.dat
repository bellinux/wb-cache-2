The captain of the Hannah drowned at Cohasset and the vessel Mary was also beached, but the latter craft's crew survived. At Cape Cod, the Protector was swept inland near Highland Light, losing $100,000 (1804USD) in goods and leading to one death, while the John Harris capsized nearby, its crew perishing with <b>it.</b> <b>Three</b> bodies were also washed ashore at Plymouth, apparently from drowning at sea.
