Descriptive sensory analysis with a trained panel was carried out when sensory differences in the triangle test were noticed.

At that time, glutathione <b>inactive</b> dry <b>yeast</b> wines were more intense in fruity aromas (strawberry, banana) and less intense in yeast notes than control wine. The impact of the glutathione <b>inactive</b> dry <b>yeast</b> in the aroma might be the consequence of different effects that these preparations could induce in wine composition: modification of yeast byproducts during fermentation, release of volatile compounds from <b>inactive</b> dry <b>yeast,</b> interaction of wine volatile compounds with <b>yeast</b> macromolecules from <b>inactive</b> dry <b>yeast</b> and a possible antioxidant {{effect of the}} glutathione released by the <b>inactive</b> dry <b>yeast</b> preparation on some specific volatile compounds.

5000|$|Primary {{fermentation}} in homebrewing {{takes place}} in large glass or plastic carboys or food-grade plastic buckets, nearly always sealed. When sealed, the fermenter is stoppered with a fermentation lock which allows the carbon dioxide gas produced to vent, while preventing other gasses and particles from entering. Recent innovations in nanotechnology have enabled a fermentation lock called the Sterilock to also prevent bacteria, wild yeasts and other potential harmful fungi reaching the fermenter although in some beer styles known as Sour Beer, bacteria or wild yeasts are desirable to obtain the sour characteristics. During this time, temperatures should be kept at optimum temperature for the particular yeast strain being used. For ale this temperature is usually 18 - 24 C; for lager it is usually much colder, around 10 C. A vigorous fermentation then takes place, usually starting within twelve hours and continuing {{over the next few}} days. During this stage, the fermentable sugars (maltose, glucose, and sucrose) are consumed by the yeast, while ethanol and carbon dioxide are produced as byproducts by the yeast. A layer of sediment, the lees or [...] "trub", appears {{at the bottom of the}} fermenter, composed of heavy fats, proteins and <b>inactive</b> <b>yeast.</b> Often, the brew is moved to a second fermenting vessel after primary fermentation called a secondary fermenter. This secondary fermentation process is often utilized by more advanced home brewers to enhance flavor. While not required, it is generally practiced by home brewers who wish to age or clarify their beer by removing it from the sediment left behind by primary fermentation. In addition to using two different fermenting containers, some home brewers may choose to only use one container in which primary and secondary fermentation take place. This container is usually referred to as a uni-tank. Uni-tanks are usually conical in shape, and can either be made from plastic or stainless steel. A popular plastic conical for homebrewing is FastFerment, while a popular stainless steel conical fermenter for homebrewers is The Blichmann Fermenator.|$|E

Direct binding seems to be required for resistance as an inactive AVR-Pia allele did not bind RGA 5 -A. A small Avr interaction domain with homology to the Avr recognition domain in the rice R protein Pik- 1 was identified in the C terminus of RGA 5 -A.

40|$|Sec 14 -like phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylcholine (PtdIns/PtdCho) {{transfer}} proteins (PITPs) represent important regulatory {{components that}} integrate phospholipid metabolism and membrane trafficking in eukaryotes. Data derived from yeast {{studies suggest that}} this regulation results from a Sec 14 -mediated PtdIns/PtdCho exchange reaction that stimulates PtdIns kinase activity, thus facilitating the generation of phosphoinositides (PIPs) such as PtdIns(4) P and PtdIns(4, 5) P 2. The present work reports recent findings on the roles and functional mechanisms of yeast and plant Sec 14 -like PITPs. The Arabidopsis Sec 14 -nodulin AtSFH 1, an important regulator of root hair formation, {{was used as a}} model to show that the nodulin domain represents a plasma membrane association module with high binding specificity towards PtdIns(4, 5) P 2. A Lys-rich C-terminal motif is necessary for PIP binding activity, which is amplified by homo-oligomerization of the nodulin domain. Both PIP association and homooligomerization are essential properties of AtSFH 1 and mutants defective in PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 binding can be rescued by a translational fusion with a bona fide PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 binding domain. A model for the mode of action of AtSFH 1 is proposed herein, and suggests that the physical linkage of the N-terminal Sec 14 and the nodulin domains couples PIP synthesis and organization, so as to promote defined landmarks for PIP effectors that modulate developmental control of polarized membrane growth. A second approach used to gain further insights on AtSFH 1 functions is also discussed. EMS-mutagenized plants that suppress the atsfh 1 - 1 -dependent short root hair henotype were isolated. By employing nextgeneration sequencing combined with deep candidate resequencing (dCARE), a mutation in the AtSTR 1 sulfurtranferase encoding gene was identified. The preliminary results presented here suggest that cyanide detoxifying enzymes could represent additional cellular components that regulate root hair development, possibly in a pathway that is independent of AtSFH 1. Finally, a directed evolution screen was performed in order to identify mutations that confer Sec 14 -like activities to the functionally <b>inactive</b> <b>yeast</b> Sec 14 homolog Sfh 1. Biochemical, biophysical and computational approaches helped to discover a network of transient interactions that propagates conformational energy from the lipid binding pocket to the ‘helical gating module’ that controls lipid access, thus enhancing the rates of phospholipid exchange and presentation in the mutant proteins. Taken together, the discoveries presented herein provide important details into the mechanisms regulating phospholipid exchange and PIP organization by Sec 14 -like PITPs, as well as comprehensive clues of how these fascinating proteins ultimately promote phosphoinositide homeostasis in eukaryotes...|$|E

Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of nutrient supplementation {{at this point in}} time on yeast viability and vitality.

[Methods and results]: A Control wine (Cont-W) and a wine with the G-IDY preparation (G-IDY-W) were industrially manufactured. The evolution of the phenolic composition (anthocyanins and non-anthocyanins) and colour of both types of wines was evaluated during winemaking and their shelf-life (after 1, 2, 3 and 9 months of bottle aging). Results revealed that wines manufactured with the G-IDY preparation showed differences in both their phenolic composition and colour characteristics with respect to the control wines, particularly after 9 months of aging. These differences were more evident in the anthocyanin than in the non-anthocyanin compounds. [Conclusions]: The G-IDY wines showed a greater decrease of the anthocyanins from grape origin, probably due to the formation of anthocyanin-polysaccharide complexes, and a higher concentration of some anthocyanin-derived pigments. These changes can be related to the slower colour evolution determined in wines produced using G-IDY preparations.

RESULTS: Sulfur dioxide was the highest-performing substance in protecting (+) -catechin against browning, followed by ascorbic acid and theYDpreparation. Sulfiteswere the only antioxidantwhose activitywas clearly detectable in themodel wines after 29 days of storage. Voltammetric studies demonstrated that the antioxidant capacity of the products testedwas connected to their intrinsic characteristics and their molar concentrations (catechin/antioxidant molar ratio). CONCLUSION: The YD preparation displayed a certain ability to protect polyphenols against browning. The antioxidant activity of YDs towards (+) -catechin appeared to be based on different mechanisms with respect to that of the other products tested: the insoluble portion of these preparations (cell wall residues) might have a non-negligible role, even if the ability of YDs to release compounds able to suppress oxidation cannot be rejected.

Here we demonstrate that yeast estrogen and androgen bioassays {{can be used to}} detect SERMs and SARMs, and are also useful screening tools to investigate their mode of action. Six steroidal 11 ß-substituents of E 2 (SERMs) and some arylpropionamide- and quinoline-based SARMs were tested. In addition, 7 compounds previously tested on AR agonism and determined as <b>inactive</b> in the <b>yeast</b> androgen bioassay, while QSAR modelling revealed strong binding to the human androgen receptor, are now shown to act as AR antagonists...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIBACKGROUND: The {{objective}} of this work was to study the effect of two Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains with different capabilities of polysaccharide liberation during alcoholic fermentation in addition to subsequent aging on lees with or without oak wood chips as well as aging with commercial <b>inactive</b> dry <b>yeast</b> on the physical, chemical and sensorial characteristics of Cabernet Sauvignon red wines. RESULTS: The HPS (high levels of polysaccharides) yeast strain released higher amounts of polysaccharides (429 g L− 1) than EC 1118 (390 g L− 1) during alcoholic fermentation, but the concentration equalized during the aging period (424 and 417 g L− 1 respectively). All aging techniques increased the polysaccharide concentration, but the increase was dependent on the technique applied. A higher liberation of polysaccharides reduced the concentration {{of most of the}} phenolic families analyzed. Moreover, no clear effect of the different aging techniques used in this study on color stabilization was found. The HPS wines were better valued than the EC 1118 wines by the panel of tasters after alcoholic fermentation. CONCLUSION: In general, the HPS wines showed better physicochemical and sensorial characteristics than the EC 1118 wines. According to the results obtained during the aging period, all aging techniques contributed to improve wine quality, but it was difficult to establish the technique that allowed the best wine to be obtained, because it depended on the aging technique used and the period of aging.

40|$|Fusapyrone (1) and deoxyfusapyrone (2), two alpha-pyrones {{originally}} {{isolated from}} rice cultures of Fusarium semitectum, {{were tested in}} several biological assays. Compounds 1 and 2 showed considerable antifungal activity against several plant pathogenic and/or mycotoxigenic filamentous fungi, although they were <b>inactive</b> toward <b>yeasts</b> isolated from plants and the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus megaterium in disk diffusion assays. Compound 1 was consistently more active than 2. Among the tested fungi, Fusarium species were the least sensitive to the two pyrones, while Alternaria alternata, Ascochyta rabiei, Aspergillus flavus, Botrytis cinerea, Cladosporium cucumerinum, Phoma tracheiphila, and Penicillium verrucosum were the most sensitive. Compounds 1 and 2 also showed good inhibitory activity toward agents of human mycoses. Aspergilli were the most sensitive, while some species-specific variability was found among the Candida spp. In an Artemia salina larvae bioassay, 1 was not toxic at the highest concentration tested (500 mu M), whereas the LC 50 of 2 was 37. 1 mu M (21. 8 mu g/mL). Neither 1 nor 2 was phytotoxic in a panel of assays that monitored plant-cell toxicity, as well as wilt-, chlorosis-, and necrosis-inducing activity. Moreover, 2 stimulated the root elongation of tomato seedlings at doses of 10 and 100 mu M. In consideration of the biological activities evidenced in this study, 1 and 2 appear to be potential candidates for biotechnological applications, as well as good models for studies on mechanism(s) of action and structure-activity relationships...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAntimicrobial {{peptides}} (AMPs) are {{key components}} of innate immunity and are widespread in nature, from bacteria to vertebrate animals. In crustaceans, there are currently 15 distinct AMP families published {{so far in the}} literature, mainly isolated from members of the Decapoda order. Up to now, armadillidin is the sole non-decapod AMP isolated from the haemocytes of Armadillidium vulgare, a crustacean isopod. Its first description demonstrated that armadillidin is a linear glycine-rich (47 %) cationic peptide with an antimicrobial activity directed toward Bacillus megaterium. In the present work, we report identification of armadillidin Q, a variant of armadillidin H (earlier known as armadillidin), from crude haemocyte extracts of A. vulgare using LC-MS approach. We demonstrated that both armadillidins displayed broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, but were totally <b>inactive</b> against <b>yeasts.</b> Membrane permeabilization assays, only performed with armadillidin H, showed that the peptide is membrane active against bacterial and fungal strains leading to deep changes in cell morphology. This damaging activity visualized by electronic microscopy correlates with a rapid decrease of cell viability leading to highly blebbed cells. In contrast, armadillidin H does not reveal cytotoxicity toward human erythrocytes. Furthermore, no secondary structure could be defined in this study [by circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) ] even in a membrane mimicking environment. Therefore, armadillidins represent interesting candidates to gain insight into the biology of glycine-rich AMPs...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the replacement of soybean meal by <b>inactive</b> dry <b>yeast</b> (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) from sugar cane on nutritive value of diets for Saanen goats in the peripartum. Twenty - four Saanen goats (nine primiparous, 55. 35 ± 4. 55 kg and fifteen multiparous, 73. 12 ± 8. 51 kg) in prepartum and postpartum periods were distributed in a completely randomized design with a 3 × 2 (diet × parturition order) factorial arrangement. Diets were composed of soybean meal, soybean meal plus dry yeast or dry yeast as protein source, and other ingredients: ground corn, mineral supplement and limestone. The roughage source used was the whole plant corn silage (40 % of the total diet). Diets were evaluated as dry matter intake and digestibility of nutrients. The diet with total dry yeast inclusion promoted a reduction on the ether extract intake (postpartum) and ether extract digestibility (prepartum and postpartum), due its lower ether extract content {{when compared to the}} other diets. Multiparous goats presented higher intakes for dry matter, nutrients and total digestible nutrients in both evaluated periods due their higher intake capacity. Primiparous goats in postpartum had better coefficients of digestibility for dry matter, organic matter, crude protein and total carbohydrates, and so a higher energetic value, attributed to total digestible nutrients compared to multiparous ones. Dry yeast can replace soybean meal with no changes on nutritive value of diets for Saanen goats...|$|R
40|$|Aspergillus giganteus MDH 18894 {{was found}} to produce alpha sarcin, a new {{antitumor}} agent inhibitory {{to a number of}} different animal tumors. This culture produced culture filtrates that inhibited mouse sarcoma 180 at dilutions up to 1 : 32. Optimal fermentation conditions were established for shake flasks and 30 -liter and 100 -gal (378. 5 -liter) fermentors. Results from a variety of media were reported; however, the medium which yielded the most reproducible filtrates consisted of 2 % corn starch, 1. 5 % beef extract (Difco), 2 % peptone (Difco), and 0. 5 % sodium chloride. Purified preparations of 800 sarcoma 180 dilution units per mg were <b>inactive</b> against bacteria, <b>yeasts,</b> molds, actinomycetes, and protozoa, but were cytotoxic to several strains of mammalian cells. Alpha sarcin inhibited sarcoma 180 in mice at a dose of 62. 5 μg per kg per day. A variety of other animal tumors were also inhibited by this compound...|$|R
