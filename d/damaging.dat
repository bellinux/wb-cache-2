40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{effectively}} describe the <b>damage</b> process of composite laminates {{and reduce the}} complexity of material model, a mixed <b>damage</b> model based on Linde Criteria and Hashin Criteria is proposed for prediction of impact <b>damage</b> in the study. The mixed <b>damage</b> model can predict baisc failure modes, including fiber fracture, matrix tensile <b>damage,</b> matrix compressive <b>damage.</b> Fiber <b>damage</b> and matrix <b>damage</b> in compression are described based on the progressive <b>damage</b> mechanics; and matrix <b>damage</b> in tension is described based on Continuous <b>Damage</b> Mechanics (CDM).

40|$|This Article {{proposes that}} the value of {{statistical}} life ("VSL ") be used to set the total <b>damages</b> amount needed for deterrence when punitive <b>damages</b> are warranted in wrongful death cases. The appropriate level of total <b>damages</b> should be achieved by adjusting the value of punitive <b>damages.</b> Compensatory <b>damages</b> should not be distorted to establish the total <b>damages</b> level needed for efficient deterrence. Attempts to introduce hedonic <b>damages</b> as a compensatory <b>damages</b> component, and proposals to use the VSL on a routine basis when setting compensatory <b>damages</b> awards, are misguided and will undermine the insurance and compensation functions of compensatory <b>damages.</b> The U. S. Supreme Court's focus on punitive <b>damages</b> ratios is misplaced, as it is the total <b>damages</b> amount, not the ratio, that is instrumental. The criteria for evaluating punitive <b>damages</b> in bodily injury cases should be different from the criteria used in property <b>damage</b> cases. The composition of compensatory <b>damages</b> is especially important in bodily injury cases.
