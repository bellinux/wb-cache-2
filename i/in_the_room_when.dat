The plane hit the apartment owned by Dr. Parviz Benhuri {{and his wife}} Ilana, the latter of whom was seated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>when</b> the plane crashed and sustained shrapnel injuries and burns. Her housekeeper was also present and helped her escape.|$|E
5|$|Lazard {{turns to}} Fox Mulder and Dana Scully for help. She tells them of Michelle's claims {{that a man}} had {{attacked}} Barbala, {{even though she was}} the only person <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>when</b> the detective was killed. The agents have Michelle describe the alleged attacker for a computerized facial composite; the computer seemingly glitches, displaying a face that Michelle identifies as the killer. The composite matches that of a Detective Charlie Morris — who died nine years previously in an apparent gangland hit. Mulder speaks to Michelle's psychiatrist, Dr. Braun, who tells him that she habitually mutilated dolls in a uniform manner during their sessions together, removing the same eye and arm each time; Mulder realizes that these mutilations match the circumstances of Morris' death.|$|E

25|$|As a baby, Harry was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>when</b> Voldemort's fatal Killing Curse backfired. Voldemort's soul {{had been}} {{weakened}} and destabilised by his continuous murders {{and the creation}} of his previous Horcruxes. Harry became a Horcrux when a fragment of Voldemort's soul attached itself to him after the unsuccessful curse. The lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead {{is a direct result of}} this attempted murder, and the connection that formed as a result is used to explain several important plot points. Throughout the series, Harry is able to receive insight into Voldemort's mental and emotional states, allowing the reader to eavesdrop on the series' primary antagonist. This insight is usually accompanied by pain in the scar on Harry's forehead. Through Voldemort, Harry also inherited the ability to speak and understand Parseltongue. It is also revealed by Rowling in an interview that Harry's frequent pain in his scar when Voldemort is either active, nearby, or feeling strong emotions, is really the trapped bit of soul yearning to depart from Harry's body and rejoin its master's soul.|$|E
25|$|The third act {{begins on}} the upper floor of the house, where a masked man {{is seen in the}} previously-hidden room taking a money bag from a safe. When Dale finds the room, the man flees, leaving her and the money locked inside. The others find her there, unconscious. Anderson reappears and accuses Wells of {{stealing}} the money and killing Richard. Cornelia begins to present an alternative theory, but is interrupted when the unknown man comes upstairs and Anderson asks him about his amnesia. Cornelia says that she sees a man on the roof, and most of the group leaves to look for him. Cornelia uses the distraction to tell Dale, Jack and the unknown man that she thinks the money is still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>When</b> they search for the money, Jack finds the body of Courtleigh Fleming, who was killed only recently. As Cornelia, Dale and Jack argue about what has happened, the unknown man locks the door and orders them to be quiet. When the masked man sneaks in through a window, the unknown man apprehends him and reveals that he, the unknown man, is the real Detective Anderson; the Bat (the masked man) had pretended to be Anderson.|$|E

She was something. She was good." [...] David DeVorkin, curator of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, wrote a history of manned scientific ballooning. In DeVorkin's view, the Piccards' [...] "entrepreneurship and subsequent success" [...] in ballooning was due to [...] "their enormous persistence…and considerable confidence, pluck, and luck".|$|E

Vincent Cronin {{attributes}} her absence to the nature of their relationship: [...] "From the first day by the lakeside at Neuchâtel theirs had been a Romantic love and Eve wanted to guard it to the end against that terrible taint of corruption." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Elegy" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{directed}} by James Charleston. The episode was inspired by an event that happened when Shiban and his future wife were visiting her father in the hospital. According to Shiban, he was very near death and kept looking around the room, {{even though there were}} only two visitors with him. Eventually, he asked his daughter how many people were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>When</b> his daughter revealed that there were only two people with him, he kept looking around the room. Shiban was inspired by the idea that [...] "a dying person might be able to look through the cracks [...] into the next world". He developed a premise revolving around a [...] "haunted bowling alley" [...] because [...] "it just seemed right".|$|E

500|$|The main {{location}} {{where most of}} the story takes place is the fictional Flowercrest Department Store in a derelict city. It is based on the real Matsubishi Department Store of Hamamatsu, Shizuoka in Japan, although the planetarium on the rooftop is fictitious. The onset of the story takes place within the planetarium which is where the protagonist first meets Yumemi. The most prominent feature <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>when</b> a show is not taking place is the large black planetarium projector called [...] "Miss Jena", which is placed on a stage in front of the seats. The planetarium has electricity when the protagonist arrives, but only for a short time. Once a year, for 168 hours, electricity in the planetarium is operational, but the projector is broken. The rest of the floors in the department store are in ruins; mold and rats run rampant.|$|E
500|$|Biographer Heike Görtemaker {{noted that}} {{women did not}} play {{a big role in}} the {{politics}} of the Third Reich. Braun's political influence on Hitler was apparently minimal. She was never allowed to stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>when</b> business or political conversations took place, and was sent out of the room when cabinet ministers or other dignitaries were present. She was {{not a member of the}} Nazi Party. In his post-war memoirs Hoffmann characterized Braun's outlook as [...] "inconsequential and feather-brained"; her main interests were sports, clothes, and the cinema. By all accounts, she led a sheltered and privileged existence and seemed uninterested in politics. One instance when she took an interest was in 1943, shortly after Germany had fully transitioned to a total war economy. Among other things, this meant a potential ban on women's cosmetics and luxuries. According to Speer's memoirs, Braun approached Hitler in [...] "high indignation"; Hitler quietly instructed Speer, who was armaments minister at the time, to halt production of women's cosmetics and luxuries rather than instituting an outright ban.|$|E
500|$|Public {{reception}} of Gaga's music, fashion sense, and persona is polarized. Because of her influence on modern culture, and her rise to global fame, sociologist Mathieu Deflem of the University of South Carolina {{has offered a}} course titled [...] "Lady Gaga and the Sociology of the Fame" [...] since early 2011 {{with the objective of}} unraveling [...] "some of the sociologically relevant dimensions of the fame of Lady Gaga". When Gaga met briefly with politician Barack Obama at a Human Rights Campaign fundraiser, he found the interaction [...] "intimidating" [...] as she was dressed in 16-inch heels, making her the tallest woman <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>When</b> interviewed by Barbara Walters for her annual ABC News special 10 Most Fascinating People in 2009, Gaga dismissed the claim that she is intersex as an urban legend. Responding to a question on this issue, she expressed her fondness for androgyny. In a 2010 Sunday Times article, Camille Paglia criticized Gaga as [...] "more an identity thief than an erotic taboo breaker, a mainstream manufactured product who claims to be singing for the freaks, the rebellious and the dispossessed when she is none of those".|$|E

500|$|In April 2013, J. August Richards, one of {{the stars}} of the earlier Joss Whedon series Angel, was cast in the pilot in an {{unspecified}} role, later revealed to be Mike Peterson, the first live-action portrayal of Deathlok and a recurring character throughout the season. Nicholas Brendon, another Whedon collaborator, was also reportedly considered for Richards' role. In December, two recurring characters were set to be added to the series with the episode [...] "T.A.H.I.T.I." [...] They were described as [...] "an African-American agent who specializes in combat/weapons, and a high-level S.H.I.E.L.D. agent/munitions expert who has past ties to both Coulson and Ward." [...] In January 2014, Bill Paxton was cast as Agent John Garrett, [...] "a rough-and-tumble former cohort of Agent Coulson with a little bit of attitude and cigar-smoking swagger", for at least four episodes of the season. Jed Whedon said that [...] "We actually discussed Bill Paxton <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>when</b> we were talking about the character ... Then when he came up as an actual possibility, we couldn't believe it." [...] The next month, B.J. Britt was cast as Agent Triplett, an associate of Garrett. Other recurring guests in the season include Saffron Burrows as Victoria Hand, David Conrad as Ian Quinn, and Ruth Negga as Raina.|$|E
500|$|Beiste first {{appears in}} [...] "The Role You Were Born to Play", helping Finn {{when he goes}} looking for a jock to play {{the lead in the}} school musical. Beiste {{continues}} to advise Finn when he takes charge of the glee club for the duration of Will's stay in Washington while he serves on a blue-ribbon arts panel. Beiste also acts as faculty advisor to the school's superheroes club. When Sam (Chord Overstreet) and Brittany think the Mayan apocalypse is imminent and decide to get married, Beiste offers to marry them, but makes sure to perform a ceremony that is not valid legally. When the apocalypse does not happen, they are relieved when the coach tells them that they are not, in fact, married. Later in the season, after Emma leaves Will at the altar on their wedding day and the two are briefly estranged, Beiste confesses to falling in love with him, but he tells the coach that he and Emma have recently gotten back together. Will asks a hurt Beiste to come to glee club; Beiste does so reluctantly, but as the period begins, two gunshots are heard in the school, and Beiste assists in barricading the choir room, helping to keep everyone quiet, and aiding Will in subduing Sam when he wants to go out and search for Brittany, who was not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>when</b> the lockdown began. Afterward, Beiste tells Will that he should reach out to forgive Finn, whose role as Will's assistant on the glee club was terminated when Finn admitted to kissing Emma while Will was in Washington, and he does so.|$|E

Claire Suddath of Time magazine commented that [...] "this offering from the reigning queen of pop music is relatively toned down and yet she still looked and sounded better than nearly everyone else at the awards." [...] Similarly, Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "If you had to pick one defining moment, {{it would have to}} be Beyoncé’s baby bump. The diva's rendition of 'Love on Top' might not have been her best VMA performance ever, but there’s no denying the sheer electricity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>when</b> she ended her set by proudly revealing her pregnant tummy." [...] A critic of Essence magazine concluded that [...] " [...] performance of 'Love on Top' at the 2011 VMAs [...] will surely be one of the year's most memorable pop culture moments." [...] The writers of MTV News placed the performance at number 4 on their list of Best Live MTV Performances of 2011.

2500|$|My Own Prison {{had been}} {{circulating}} around {{the music industry}} for a while when, in May 1997, Diana Meltzer from Wind-Up Records heard the album {{for the first time}} and decided almost immediately that she wanted to sign them to the label, which had recently dropped Baboon over the latter's reluctance to alter their image and sound to suit the label's demands. Meltzer later said that she heard [...] "an arena band". Within the same week, Meltzer, together with Wind-up president Steve Lerner, CEO Alan Meltzer, and A representative Joel Mark, flew to Tallahassee to see Creed perform live and decide for certain whether to offer them a contract. [...] "Seeing the energy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>when</b> Scott Stapp stepped up to the mike, and hearing his powerful voice fill the room, alongside Mark Tremonti’s now legendary guitar riffs and that big Creed anthemic rock sound, was all I needed," [...] she told HitQuarters. According to Hanson, before Wind-up signed Creed, fourteen labels had already passed on the band, and at one point he was tempted to take charge of them himself.|$|E
2500|$|Rose would {{occasionally}} sexually abuse the girl herself, and would later take extreme gratification in degrading {{the child with}} acts such as binding Anna Marie to various items of furniture before encouraging Fred to rape her, and forcing her to perform household chores while wearing sexual devices and a mini-skirt. From the age of 13, both Fred and Rose forced Anna Marie to prostitute herself within the household, with her clients being informed Anna Marie was 16. Nonetheless, Rose was always present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>when</b> these acts occurred, to ensure the girl did not reveal her true age. On one occasion when Anna Marie was aged either 13 or 14, Rose took the girl to a local pub, insisting she drink several glasses of barley wine. Several hours later, Fred arrived at the pub to collect Rose and Anna Marie. Once the trio had left the premises, Anna Marie was bundled into her father's van and beaten by Rose, who asked the girl the question: [...] "Do {{you think you could}} be my friend?" [...] before she was sexually abused by both her father and stepmother.|$|E
2500|$|Set dresser Frank Silva {{was cast}} as the mysterious [...] "Bob". Lynch himself recalls that the idea {{originated}} when he overheard Silva moving furniture around in the bedroom set, and then heard a woman warning Silva not to block himself in by moving furniture {{in front of the}} door. Lynch was struck with an image of Silva <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>When</b> he learned that Silva was an actor, he filmed two panning shots, one with Silva {{at the base of the}} bed, and one without; he did not yet know how he would use this material. Later that day, during the filming of Sarah Palmer having a vision, the camera operator told Lynch that the shot was ruined because [...] "Frank [...] was reflected in the mirror." [...] Lynch comments, [...] "Things like this happen and make you start dreaming. And one thing leads to another, and if you let it, a whole other thing opens up." [...] Lynch used the panning shot of Silva in the bedroom, and the shot featuring Silva's reflection, in the closing scenes of the European version of the pilot episode. Silva's reflection in the mirror can also be glimpsed during the scene of Sarah's vision at the end of the original pilot, but it is less clear. A close-up of Silva in the bedroom later became a significant image in episodes of the TV series.|$|E
