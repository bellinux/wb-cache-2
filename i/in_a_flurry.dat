5|$|At {{the same}} time, Philip engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of {{diplomatic}} activity. He bribed Berisades, {{son of the}} Thracian king Cotys, to withdraw Thracian support for Pausanias, and thereby prevented the Thracian invasion. Similarly, he bought off the Paionians with gifts {{in exchange for their}} withdrawal from Macedon. Philip may also have concluded a treaty with the victorious Dardanian king Bardylis, possibly surrendering large parts of Macedon in exchange for peace. Although no evidence remains of such a treaty, the fact that Illyrians did not follow up their victory despite Macedon's weakness is suggestive that some agreement was reached. Philip also married Bardylis's daughter (or niece), which may have formed part of the treaty. At any rate, Philip's diplomacy gave Macedon some breathing space and time for recovery.|$|E

5|$|With the {{resumption}} of hostilities, Napoleon (proclaimed Emperor in 1804) planned an invasion of England, spending {{the better part of}} the next two years (1803–05) on this objective. In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish agreement led to the creation of the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against France and neutralising the threat of invasion. Mutual suspicion between the British and the Russians eased in the face of several French political mistakes, and by April 1805, the two had signed a treaty of alliance. Alarmed by Napoleon's consolidation of northern Italy into a kingdom under his rule, and keen on revenge for having been defeated twice in recent memory by France, Austria would join the coalition a few months later.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, the two {{armies of}} unequal {{strength}} {{faced each other}} across frozen fields fissured by ice-covered streams and ponds, which were in turn covered by snow and drifts. The snow and gloom meant that neither side {{was aware of the}} inequalities of men and artillery. Napoleon opened the engagement by sending Soult's's corps, which successfully pushed the Russian right flank back, nearly turning the Russian force. To follow up on this success, he ordered Pierre Augereau's force to attack the left center. No sooner had Augereau and VII Corps, plus St. Hilaire's division, sallied out when a sudden snow storm engulfed the battle field. In white-out conditions, Augereau's entire corps disappeared <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of whirling snow. When the snow cleared, friend and foe alike discovered that the first units onto the field had wandered off course. The line of march should have taken them directly to the Russian flank; have no point of reference, they had instead followed the terrain and led the entire corps parallel to the Russian line, along a V-shaped formation in which the left and center merged, and directly into the face of the Russian 70–gun batteries. The artillery, although shocked to find a French Corps advancing straight toward them, immediately opened fire, as did the Russian infantry on both sides of Augereau's corps.|$|E

25|$|On 24 April 1915, {{an account}} was {{published}} in the British Spiritualist magazine telling of visions of a supernatural force that miraculously intervened to help the British at the decisive moment of the battle. This rapidly resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of similar accounts and the spread of wild rumours. Descriptions of this force varied from it being medieval longbow archers alongside St. George to a strange luminous cloud, though eventually the most popular version came to be angelic warriors. Similar tales of such battlefield visions occurred in medieval and ancient warfare. Atrocity reports like the Rape of Belgium and that of the Crucified Soldier paved the way for a belief that the Christian God would intervene directly against such an evil enemy. However, there are strong similarities between many of these accounts of visions and Machen's story published six months earlier.|$|E
25|$|The {{month of}} May began with United playing their 5th game in 18 days {{and with a}} back line that had one healthy centerback, Brandon McDonald. The other centerbacks, Emiliano Dudar, Dejan Jakovic and Ethan White, were all out due to injuries. Playing the hottest team in the league, the San Jose Earthquakes, the defenseless United {{surrendered}} 5 goals in a 5-3 defeat. The game started well for United with a goal by Dwayne De Rosario in the eighth minute. However, the disorganized United defense gave up three goals <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> before halftime, on goals by Chris Wondolowski, Steven Lenhart and Justin Morrow. United drew close, when Daniel Woolard scored a diving header in the 64th minute. San Jose soon pulled away as Wondowlowski and Lenhart each scored their second goal of the game. Although the game was out of reach, United fans were buoyed with a late goal by substitute Hamdi Salihi, in the 88th minute. Salihi, United's much-hyped offseason signing, scored {{for the first time}} in league play, when he got on the end of a long pass by De Rosario, and neatly chipped it over the diving San Jose goalie, Jon Busch.|$|E

500|$|Saltykov {{had little}} {{concern about the}} extreme {{northwest}}ern face of the ridge, which was steep and fronted by the marshy Elsbruch, {{but a few of}} the Austrian contingents faced northwest as a precaution. He expected Frederick to attack him from the west, from Frankfurt, and from the Frankfurt outer city. The Russians constructed redans and flèche [...] to protect all the potentially weak points of their fortifications; they built glacis to cover the most shallow of the hills, and scarps and counterscarps to protect seemingly weak points. Abatis not only littered the hillsides, but dotted flat ground. [...] By 10 August, his scouts had told him that Frederick was at the far western edge of Frankfurt.

In June 1758, British General James Abercromby began amassing a large force at Fort William Henry in preparation for the military campaign directed up the Champlain Valley. [...] These forces landed {{at the north end of}} Lake George, only four miles from the fort, on July 6. [...] The French general Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, who had only arrived at Carillon in late June, engaged his troops <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of work to improve the fort's outer defenses. [...] They built, over two days, entrenchments around a rise between the fort and Mount Hope, about three-quarters of a mile (one kilometer) northwest of the fort, and then constructed an abatis (felled trees with sharpened branches pointing out) below these entrenchments. [...] Abercromby's failure to advance directly to the fort on July 7 made much of this defensive work possible. [...] Abercromby's second-in-command, Brigadier General George Howe, had been killed when his column encountered a French reconnaissance troop. [...] Abercromby [...] "felt [...] most heavily" [...] and may have been unwilling to act immediately.|$|E
