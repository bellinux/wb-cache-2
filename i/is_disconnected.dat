5|$|The {{graphics}} and characters of each worlds {{were designed to}} resemble the artwork style of each Disney films. Each Disney world is inhabited by characters from the film: including Hercules and Philoctetes in Olympus Coliseum, and Aladdin, Princess Jasmine and Jafar in Agrabah. Each world <b>is</b> <b>disconnected</b> from the others and exists separately. Most characters in the worlds are unaware of other ones, with few exceptions. Players travel from one world to another via Gummi Ship.|$|E
5|$|After the car <b>is</b> <b>disconnected</b> {{from the}} rest of the train on a remote rail siding, Mulder {{questions}} the Red-Haired Man, who says that the patient is immune to biological warfare. Zama had tried to sneak the patient out of the country, but the government would rather see it destroyed than let their research fall into Japanese hands; the Red-Haired Man was sent to kill them both. Mulder, however, believes that the patient is an alien-human hybrid. With help from Scully, Mulder successfully unlocks the door of the railcar, but he is knocked unconscious by the Red-Haired Man. As the Red-Haired Man is about to leave, X appears and shoots him. Realizing that the bomb is about to explode and that there is not enough time to both save Mulder and secure the patient, X decides to save Mulder. X exits carrying the still unconscious Mulder shortly before the bomb explodes.|$|E
5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power <b>is</b> <b>disconnected.</b>|$|E

25|$|The label {{consists}} of a molecule called ubiquitin. This fastens to the protein to be destroyed, accompanies it to the proteasome where it is recognised as the key in a lock, and signals that a protein {{is on the way}} for disassembly. Shortly before the protein is squeezed into the proteasome, its ubiquitin label <b>is</b> <b>disconnected</b> for re-use. Examples of processes governed by ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation are cell division, DNA repair, quality control of newly produced proteins, and important parts of the immune defence.|$|E

25|$|A {{minimum weight}} {{basis of a}} graphic matroid is a minimum {{spanning}} tree (or minimum spanning forest, if the underlying graph <b>is</b> <b>disconnected).</b> Algorithms for computing minimum spanning trees have been intensively studied; it is known how {{to solve the problem}} in linear randomized expected time in a comparison model of computation, or in linear time in a model of computation in which the edge weights are small integers and bitwise operations are allowed on their binary representations. The fastest known time bound that has been proven for a deterministic algorithm is slightly superlinear.|$|E
25|$|The two {{dominant}} vegetation communities, sandstone woodland {{and eastern}} gully forest, have species compositions {{very different from}} that of the same communities in other areas. The species richness of dry sclerophyll forests, dry sclerophyll woodlands and heathlands are greater than in similar coastal communities within NSW. There are also vegetation communities which are not well represented in other existing Sydney sandstone conservation areas. The O’Hares Creek Shale Forest community, which has a low population density, and the black cypress pine of the Woronora Plateau, which <b>is</b> <b>disconnected</b> from other populations, are both classified as endangered.|$|E

25|$|Typical {{criticism}} of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over-representation of romantic historical epics, biographical dramas, romantic dramedies, and family melodramas, {{most of which are}} released in the U.S. the last three months of the calendar year. The Oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded. This has led to the coining of the term 'Oscar bait', describing such movies. This has led at times to more specific criticisms that the Academy <b>is</b> <b>disconnected</b> from the audience, e.g., by favoring 'Oscar bait' over audience favorites, or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{models have}} an ambidextrous manual safety/decocker {{located on the}} slide; when the safety lever is lowered to the safe position, the firing pin is cammed into the slide away from the hammer, the trigger <b>is</b> <b>disconnected</b> from the sear, and the hammer is decocked. The decocker models have no manual safety; instead, when the lever is lowered, it only cams the firing pin into the slide and drops the hammer. When the lever is released, the firing pin springs back to the normal position. The DAO models have no manual safety or decocker. All models feature an automatic firing pin safety that blocks the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully rearward.|$|E
25|$|As {{attitudes towards}} {{alternative}} sexualities have broadened, and as gay styles {{have become increasingly}} mainstream, {{there has been a}} loosening of the boundaries between male and female styles. Through which Rusty Barrett refers to as indexical disjuncture, it is possible that an index <b>is</b> <b>disconnected</b> from the social meaning it used to be linked to. In the 1980s, Bear style emerged in response to the dominant ideologies in the gay community that marginalized heavyset men. Bear culture emphasizes size and hairiness while still embracing qualities and endeavors associated with women, which is, however, counter-cultural with respect to both heteronormativity as well as the dominant gay aesthetic. After all, the boundaries of gender expression are loosened.|$|E

25|$|Two- and four-pole {{breakers}} {{are used}} {{when there is}} a need to disconnect multiple phase AC, or to disconnect the neutral wire to ensure that no current flows through the neutral wire from other loads connected to the same network when workers may touch the wires during maintenance. Separate circuit breakers must never be used for live and neutral, because if the neutral <b>is</b> <b>disconnected</b> while the live conductor stays connected, a dangerous condition arises: the circuit appears de-energized (appliances don't work), but wires remain live and some residual-current devices (RCDs) may not trip if someone touches the live wire (because some RCDs need power to trip). This is why only common trip breakers must be used when neutral wire switching is needed.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{grounded}} appliances {{have been}} designed with internal isolation {{to a degree that}} allowed the simple disconnection of ground by cheater plugs without apparent problem (a dangerous practice, since the safety of the resulting floating equipment relies on the insulation in its power transformer). Modern appliances however often include power entry modules which are designed with deliberate capacitive coupling between the AC power lines and chassis, to suppress electromagnetic interference. This results in a significant leakage current from the power lines to ground. If the ground <b>is</b> <b>disconnected</b> by a cheater plug or by accident, the resulting leakage current can cause mild shocks, even without any fault in the equipment. Even small leakage currents are a significant concern in medical settings, as the accidental disconnection of ground can introduce these currents into sensitive parts of the human body. As a result, medical power supplies are designed to have low capacitance.|$|E
25|$|Hoses may {{be fitted}} to low {{pressure}} ports of the regulator first stage to provide gas for inflating buoyancy compensators and/or dry suits. These hoses {{usually have a}} quick-connector end with an automatically sealing valve which blocks flow if the hose <b>is</b> <b>disconnected</b> from the buoyancy compensator or suit. There are two basic styles of connector, which are not compatible with each other. The high flow rate CEJN 221 fitting has a larger bore and allows gas flow at a fast enough rate {{for use as a}} connector to a demand valve. This is sometimes seen in a combination BC inflator/deflator mechanism with integrated secondary DV (octopus), such as in the AIR II unit from Scubapro. The low flow rate Seatec connector is more common and is the industry standard for BC inflator connectors, and is also popular on dry suits, as the limited flow rate reduces the risk of a blow-up if the valve sticks open. The high flow rate connector is used by some manufacturers on dry suits.|$|E
