5|$|As Diane <b>has</b> <b>missed</b> her flight, she {{suggests}} to Ric that they visit his father's grave. At the graveside, Ric tells Diane about his troubled {{relationship with his}} father, and confesses that he has feelings for her. They see a woman nearby who Diane recognises, having seen Paulina giving her money the day before. Ric confronts her, and discovers she is Esi Griffin (Gloria Acheampong), his father's last wife and widow. She has a son who is not in school, but will not explain her circumstances and tells Ric to speak to Kumi.|$|E
5|$|As {{they leave}} Vagra II, the crew holds a {{memorial}} service for Lt. Yar, with a pre-recorded simulation of Yar addressing each of the senior crew members telling them what they meant to her and what she learned from each of them. After the service, Data (Brent Spiner), who had previously become close to Yar, tells Picard that he is confused as to the purpose of the service. He says that his thoughts are for himself, because he can only think of how empty his life will be without Tasha. He asks if he <b>has</b> <b>missed</b> the point, but Picard assures him he got it.|$|E

To <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> the dinner would <b>have</b> been to <b>miss</b> as jolly and as stout a meal as man need eat; and to <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> the overflowing cups in which they drank The Wedding Day would have been the greatest miss of all.|$|R

5|$|According to a DJ Premier fan blog, The Source's {{website and}} other sites, DJ Kool Herc fell gravely ill in early 2011 and {{was said to}} lack health insurance. He had surgery for kidney stones, with a stent placed to relieve the pressure. He needed {{follow-up}} surgery but St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, the site that performed the previous surgery, has requested that he make a deposit toward the next surgery, because he <b>has</b> <b>missed</b> several follow-up visits. The hospital {{said it would not}} turn away uninsured patients in the emergency room. DJ Kool Herc and his family set up an official website on which he describes his medical issue and the larger goal of establishing the DJ Kool Herc Fund to pioneer long-term health care solutions. In April 2013, Campbell recovered from surgery and moved into post-medical care.|$|E
5|$|Kate tells Erin about Rhys' plan, but he convinces Erin that Kate is {{a jealous}} ex-girlfriend who is lying. Erin {{believes}} {{him and they}} have dinner together. Rhys pours wine on her shirt sleeve and at the hospital, he implies to Karl that Erin has a drinking problem. She quits the surgical program and Rhys asks Jessica if he can take her place. Karl realises he has been used and Rhys takes him to visit Elaine, {{to try to make}} him understand what getting on the program means to him. Elaine reveals she has spinal degeneration and Karl remarks that Rhys cannot help her. Rhys explains that he wants to help the next person to develop the condition. Rhys sits an exam on the material he <b>has</b> <b>missed</b> and Jessica allows him join the surgical program. Rhys makes a bet with Kate that he can seduce Jade, but when he goes to kiss her, Jade rejects him. Rhys' mother asks if she can visit him and Rhys tells her he is working over Easter. When they run into Jade and Kyle, Rhys does not introduce them to Elaine and she accuses him of being ashamed of her. Rhys then takes Elaine to meet Martin, who reveals he failed his surgical program interview. Elaine accuses him of lying to her and being like his father. Rhys denies this and Elaine tells him to fix things with the people he has hurt.|$|E
5|$|In the 2017 Rogers Cup, held in Montreal, Nadal had {{a chance}} to regain the ATP No. 1 ranking if he made the semi-finals; however, he lost in the 3rd round to Canadian {{teenager}} Denis Shapovalov. Federer progressed to the final, where he lost to Alexander Zverev and sustained an injury during the second set. Due to the renewed back injury, Federer then pulled out of the 2017 Cincinnati Masters, leaving Nadal as the only Big Four player competing there and allowing him to reclaim the ATP No. 1 ranking. In the 2017 Cincinnati Masters, Nadal was knocked out by Nick Kyrgios in the quarter-finals, breaking the streak of 42 consecutive Big Four appearances in Masters 1000 semi-finals and finals. At the US Open, Nadal was be seeded first (for the first time at a major since 2014), Murray second, and Federer, who is only 5 points behind Murray, third. The 2017 US Open would also be the first major Djokovic <b>has</b> <b>missed</b> after a streak of 51 consecutive appearances. Furthermore, Murray ultimately pulled out of the US Open, having not recovered from his hip injury suffered during Wimbledon, leaving just Nadal and Federer as the only Big Four players remaining in the draw. With this withdrawal, Murray would fall out of the top 2 {{for the first time since}} May 2016. Nadal made the semi-finals, while Federer lost in the quarter-finals to Juan Martin del Potro. This loss ended Federer's undefeated record in Grand Slam matches during 2017, and also marked the sixth time that both Federer and Nadal came within one match of meeting each other at the US Open, but did not do so due to one of them losing. This phenomenon previously occurred at the semi-finals of all US Opens between 2008 and 2011, and in the fourth round of the 2013 tournament. Nadal then defeated Del Potro to reach his first US Open final since 2013, and defeated Kevin Anderson in the final to win his third US Open title.|$|E
