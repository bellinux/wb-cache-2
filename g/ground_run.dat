500|$|Investigators also {{focused on}} deicing {{practices}} at LaGuardia. They {{found that the}} airport was using only Type I deicing fluid, not Type II. Type I fluids are used for the actual deicing of the jet, while Type II fluids are used for preventing buildup of ice. At {{the time of the}} accident, LaGuardia had prohibited the use of Type II deicing fluid because tests suggested that if it fell onto runways it reduced friction. Investigators noted the change had been made because of LaGuardia's shorter runways and the fact that if an aircraft left the vicinity of the runway, it would come to rest in the cold water surrounding Runway 13. The accident report, however, criticised the fact {{that the majority of the}} airplane operators in the United States relied only upon Type I fluids for protection, and they do not use Type II. The board stated that tests have shown that both Type I and Type II fluids do flow off the wings of a treated airplane in significant amounts during the initial takeoff <b>ground</b> <b>run.</b> The NTSB stated: ...|$|E

2500|$|... 20 July 1975 – A British Island Airways (BIA) Handley Page Dart Herald 201 (registration: G-APWF) was {{involved}} in a runway accident while departing on a scheduled flight to Guernsey. The aircraft lifted off from runway 26 after a <b>ground</b> <b>run</b> of , and appeared airborne for [...] (with its landing gear retracting), before the rear underside of the fuselage settled back onto the runway and brought the aircraft to a stop. An investigation concluded that the landing gear was retracted before the aircraft had become established in a climb and the flap setting and takeoff speed were incorrect. Although the aircraft incurred substantial damage, none of the 45 occupants were hurt.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prototype}} {{and early}} production Hurricanes were {{fitted with a}} Watts two-bladed fixed-pitch wooden propeller. Flight commented of this arrangement: [...] "Many have expressed surprise that the Hurricane is not fitted with variable-pitch airscrews". The original two-bladed propeller {{was found to be}} inefficient at low airspeeds and the aircraft required a long <b>ground</b> <b>run</b> to get airborne, which caused concern at Fighter Command. Accordingly, trials with a De Havilland variable-pitch propeller demonstrated a reduction in the Hurricane's take-off run from [...] Deliveries of these began in April 1939: this was later replaced by the hydraulically operated constant-speed Rotol propeller, which came into service in time for the Battle of Britain.|$|E
2500|$|Mk.320:The {{performance}} specification for the BAC TSR-2 was issued in 1962. It {{was to be}} powered by two BSEL Olympus Mk 320 (BOl.22R) engines each rated at [...] dry and [...] with reheat at take-off. The engine, which was re-stressed for supersonic flight at sea level, and over Mach 2.0 at altitude, and featured much use of high-temperature alloys such as titanium and Nimonic, was a cutting edge derivative of the Olympus Mk 301 with a Solar-type afterburner. The engine first ran in March 1961, soon achieving , and was test flown in February 1962 in an underslung nacelle {{in the belly of}} Vulcan B1 XA894 and was demonstrated at the Farnborough Air Show in September. In December 1962 during a full power <b>ground</b> <b>run</b> at Filton, the LP shaft failed. The liberated turbine disc ruptured fuel tanks and the subsequent fire completely destroyed the Vulcan.|$|E

2500|$|The XF-84H {{was quite}} {{possibly}} the loudest aircraft ever built (rivaled {{only by the}} Russian Tupolev Tu-95 [...] "Bear" [...] bomber), earning the nickname [...] "Thunderscreech" [...] {{as well as the}} [...] "Mighty Ear Banger". On the ground [...] "run ups", the prototypes could reportedly be heard [...] away. [...] Unlike standard propellers that turn at subsonic speeds, the outer [...] of the blades on the XF-84H's propeller traveled faster than the speed of sound even at idle thrust, producing a continuous visible sonic boom that radiated laterally from the propellers for hundreds of yards. The shock wave was actually powerful enough to knock a man down; an unfortunate crew chief who was inside a nearby C-47 was severely incapacitated during a 30-minute <b>ground</b> <b>run.</b> Coupled with the already considerable noise from the subsonic aspect of the propeller and the dual turbines, the aircraft was notorious for inducing severe nausea and headaches among ground crews. In one report, a Republic engineer suffered a seizure after close range exposure to the shock waves emanating from a powered-up XF-84H.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{incident}} occurred on 20 July 1975. It involved {{another of the}} company's Handley Page Dart Heralds (registration: G-APWF) in a runway accident while departing London Gatwick on a scheduled flight to Guernsey. According to eye-witness reports, the aircraft lifted off from runway 26 after a <b>ground</b> <b>run</b> of [...] and appeared airborne for [...] with its landing gear retracting before the rear underside of the fuselage settled back on to the runway. None of the 45 occupants, including the 41 passengers who were safely evacuated via the aircraft's crew entrance door by the two cabin crew members on the instructions of the flight's commander, were hurt in that accident. The subsequent investigation concluded that this accident had been caused by the landing gear being retracted before the aircraft had been properly established in its initial climb. Other contributory factors included a mistaken wing flap configuration and the resulting inadequate airspeed at rotation. The aircraft itself sustained substantial damage and required extensive repairs {{in order to be}} restored to an airworthy condition.|$|E
2500|$|Production {{aircraft}} were {{powered by}} various {{models of the}} Rolls-Royce Avon engine. This power-plant was initially rated as capable of generating [...] of dry thrust, but when employing the four-stage afterburner this increased to a maximum thrust of [...] Later models of the Avon would feature, in addition to increased thrust, a full-variable reheat arrangement. A special heat-reflecting paint containing gold was used to protect the aircraft's structure from the hot engine casing which could reach temperatures of 600°C. Under optimum conditions, a well-equipped maintenance facility would take four hours to perform an engine change so specialised ground test rigs were developed to speed up maintenance and remove the need to perform a full <b>ground</b> <b>run</b> of the engine after some maintenance tasks. The stacked engine configuration complicated maintenance work, and the leakage of fluid from the upper engine was a recurring fire hazard. The fire risk was reduced, but not eliminated, following remedial work during development. For removal the lower No.1 engine was removed from below the aircraft, after removal of the ventral tank and lower fuselage access panels, by lowering the engine down, while the upper No.2 engine was lifted out from above via removable sections in the fuselage top.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout most of {{the history}} of New York City, and New Amsterdam before it, the East River has been the {{receptacle}} for the city's garbage and sewage. [...] "Night men" [...] who collected [...] "night soil" [...] from outdoor privies would dump their loads into the river, and even after the construction of the Croton Aqueduct (1842) and then the New Croton Aqueduct (1890) gave rise to indoor plumbing, the waste that was flushed away into the sewers, where it mixed with <b>ground</b> <b>run</b> off, ran directly into the river, untreated. [...] The sewers terminated at the slips where ships docked, until the waste began to build up, preventing dockage, after which the outfalls were moved {{to the end of the}} piers. [...] The [...] "landfill" [...] which created new land along the shoreline when the river was [...] "wharfed out" [...] by the sale of [...] "water lots" [...] was largely garbage such as bones, offal, and even whole dead animals, along with excrement [...] human and animal. [...] The result was that by the 1850s, if not before, the East River, like the other waterways around the city, was undergoing the process of eutrophication where the increase in nitrogen from excrement and other sources lead to a decrease in free oxygen, which in turn lead to an increase in phytoplankton such as algae and a decrease in other life forms, breaking the area's established food chain. The East River became very polluted, and its animal life decreased drastically.|$|E

50|$|Of equal {{importance}} to short <b>ground</b> <b>run</b> {{is the ability}} to clear obstacles, such as hills, on both take off and landing. For takeoff, large power/weight ratios and low drag result in a high rate of climb required to clear obstacles. For landing, high drag allows the aeroplane to descend steeply to the runway without building excess speed resulting in a longer <b>ground</b> <b>run.</b> Drag is increased by use of flaps (devices on the wings) and by a forward slip (causing the aeroplane to fly somewhat sideways through the air to increase drag).|$|E
