5|$|Historian George Ostrogorsky {{believed}} that volunteers were gathered through {{the reorganization of}} Anatolia into four themes, where the volunteers were given <b>inalienable</b> grants of land {{on the condition of}} hereditary military service. However, modern scholars generally discredit this theory, placing the creation of the themes later, under Heraclius' successor Constans II.|$|E
5|$|For most girls, {{childhood}} {{came to an}} {{end with}} the onset of puberty, which was followed shortly after by betrothal and marriage. Although marriage arranged by the family was the norm, romantic love was not unknown. Most women bore many children but few survived infancy, and grief for the loss of a loved one was an <b>inalienable</b> part of life. The main form of birth control was abstinence, and while there is evidence of contraception it seems to have been mainly used by prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|We {{believe that}} it is the <b>inalienable</b> right of the Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full {{opportunities}} of growth. We believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them the people have a further right to alter it or abolish it. The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually. We believe therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraji or complete sovereignty and self-rule.|$|E
5|$|The High Court quickly {{assembled}} at Nikli. Guy de la Roche {{presented himself}} before it {{accompanied by his}} own knights, but the assembled barons decided {{that they did not}} have the authority to judge him, and referred the matter to King Louis IX of France (r. 1226–1270). Guy travelled to France in 1259, but Louis not only pardoned him, but awarded him the title of Duke, which he and his successors were to bear thereafter. The renegade Geoffroy de Bruyères too was brought for judgement before William, and it was only the determined and passionate intercession of the other barons that saved his life and secured a pardon from the vengeful prince. He was however deprived of the possession of his domains by the <b>inalienable</b> right of conquest, and retained them henceforth as a gift from the Prince, meaning that they would be forfeit upon his death unless he had any immediate descendants.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{the cattle}} station {{was taken over}} by the Muckaty Aboriginal Corporation. The Corporation focused on rehabilitating the land, which had been {{degraded}} by excessive numbers of cattle, and by late 1993 Muckaty had been destocked of cattle for several seasons. On 20December 1991, the Northern Land Council lodged a claim over Muckaty on behalf of traditional owners under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976. The claim was made by members of the seven groups that each has responsibility for different sites and dreamings in the area. In 1997, the Aboriginal Land Commissioner recommended that Muckaty Station be handed back to the traditional owners, and in February 1999, title to the land was returned. At the time there were about 400formal traditional owners, among 1,000people with traditional attachments to the land; some lived on the station, but others were elsewhere in the region, including in the nearby towns of Tennant Creek and Elliott. As Aboriginal Freehold land it is <b>inalienable</b> communal title, and cannot be bought or sold. The pastoral lease holder and manager of the station since 1997 has been Ray Aylett. The Adelaide–Darwin railway, which passes through the western part of Muckaty Station, was completed in early 2004.|$|E
25|$|One typological study {{discovered}} that in 78% of South American languages that do distinguish between <b>inalienable</b> and alienable possession, <b>inalienable</b> possession {{was associated with}} fewer morphological markers than its alienable counterpart; by contrast, {{only one of the}} surveyed languages required more morphological features to mark <b>inalienable</b> possession than alienable possession. If a language makes a grammatical distinction between alienable and <b>inalienable</b> nouns, it is redundant to have an overt possessive marker to mark inalienability; by nature of being <b>inalienable,</b> a noun must be possessed.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{relationships}} listed above {{are likely to}} be instances of <b>inalienable</b> possession, ultimately what is classified as <b>inalienable</b> depends on language- and culture-specific conventions. It is impossible to say that a particular relationship is an example of <b>inalienable</b> possession without specifying the languages for which this holds true. For example, neighbor may be an <b>inalienable</b> noun in one language, but alienable in another. Thus, whether a certain type of relationship is described as alienable or <b>inalienable</b> can be arbitrary, and in this respect alienability is similar to other types of noun classes, such as grammatical gender.|$|E
25|$|In <b>inalienable</b> {{possession}} constructions, {{the relationship}} between the possessor and possesee is stronger than in alienable possession constructions. Johanna Nichols characterizes this through the tendency of <b>inalienable</b> possession to be head-marked but alienable possession to be dependent-marked. In head-marking, the head of an <b>inalienable</b> possession construction (the possessed noun) is marked, whereas in dependent-marking, the dependent (the possessor noun) is marked.|$|E
25|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{accounts for}} differences between French and English, {{and it may}} also eliminate the ambiguity created by definite determiners. According to this hypothesis, anaphoric binding in <b>inalienable</b> possession constructions relates to the theta-features that a language assigns to its determiners. This hypothesis predicts that <b>inalienable</b> possession constructions exist in languages which assign variable theta-features to its determiners and that <b>inalienable</b> possession constructions do not exist in languages which lack variable theta-feature assignment. Therefore, <b>inalienable</b> possession is predicted to exist in Romance languages and even Russian but not in languages like English or Hebrew. In the French sentence Il lève les mains, the determiner les is assigned theta-features. Thus, it is understood as <b>inalienable</b> possession. However, in the English translation, the determiner the does not have theta-features because English {{is considered one of}} the languages that does not assign theta-features to its determiners. Therefore, the does not necessarily signify <b>inalienable</b> possession, and ambiguity surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Hawaiian uses {{different}} prepositions to mark possession {{depending on}} alienability. a (alienable of) {{is used to}} indicate alienable possession, as in (13a) and (14a), whereas o (<b>inalienable</b> of) indicates <b>inalienable</b> possession.|$|E
25|$|This possessive marker {{does not}} occur in <b>inalienable</b> {{possession}} constructions. Thus, the absence of ɛ̃̀ɟ, as in example (5), indicates {{that the relationship between}} the possessor and possessee is one of <b>inalienable</b> possession.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between alienable and <b>inalienable</b> possession is often marked with various morphosyntactic properties such as morphological markers and word order. There {{is a strong}} typological pattern for <b>inalienable</b> possession to require fewer morphological markers than alienable possession constructions.|$|E
25|$|The {{examples}} below {{illustrate that}} the same phrase, the table's legs, is regarded as <b>inalienable</b> possession in Italian but not in French: (1b) is ungrammatical (as indicated by the asterisk); French cannot use the <b>inalienable</b> possession construction for a relationship which is alienable.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>inalienable</b> reading, arm is a {{complement}} of the determiner phrase. This contrasts to the alienable reading where John has an arm {{is part of}} the determiner. Fillmore and Chomsky make a syntactic distinction between alienable and <b>inalienable</b> possession and suggest that this distinction is relevant to English.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{distinction}} between a (alienable of) and o (<b>inalienable</b> of) is used for other semantic distinctions less clearly attributable to common alienability relationships except in metaphorical ways. Although lei is a tangible object, in Hawaiian this noun can be either alienable (15a) or <b>inalienable</b> (15b) depending on the context.|$|E
25|$|If {{explicit}} possessors {{are absent}} (as in (11b) and (12b)), the phrase is ungrammatical. In (11), the possessor ni {{is necessary for}} the <b>inalienable</b> noun nik (arm). In (12), the same phenomenon is found with the <b>inalienable</b> noun ookmis (grandmother), which needs the possessor morpheme n to be grammatical.|$|E
25|$|This is {{demonstrated}} in Hua, a Papuan language. In Hua, alienable possession {{is marked by}} a free form pronoun as in (27a). In contrast, <b>inalienable</b> possession constructions use an <b>inalienable</b> possessor prefixed on the possessee, as in (27b). This construction has less linguistic distance between the possessor and possessee than in the alienable construction.|$|E
25|$|In (9), the genitive Sely {{precedes the}} possessee me, marking <b>inalienable</b> possession.|$|E

25|$|Spanish {{also uses}} a {{definite}} article (las) to indicate <b>inalienable</b> possession for body part constructions.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} this {{semantic}} dependency {{is the difference between}} possible interpretations in a language that marks <b>inalienable</b> possession (e.g. French) with a language that does not (e.g. English). <b>Inalienable</b> possession is semantically dependent and is defined in reference to another object to which it belongs. (20) is ambiguous and has two possible meanings. In the <b>inalienable</b> possessive interpretation, la main belongs to the subject, les enfants. The second interpretation is that la main is an alienable object that does not belong to the subject. The English equivalent of this sentence (The children raised the hand) only has the alienable possessive reading in which the hand does not belong to the children.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between alienable and <b>inalienable</b> possession constructions may be {{marked with a}} difference in word order. Igbo uses another syntactic process when the subject and the possessor refer to different entities. In possessor switch, the possessor of the <b>inalienable</b> noun is placed {{as close as possible}} to the verb. In the following examples, the possessor yá is not deleted because the two referents in this sentence are different.|$|E
25|$|German uses a {{definite}} article (die) for the <b>inalienable</b> body part construction, but a possessive (meine) for alienable possession.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between alienable and <b>inalienable</b> possessions can {{be influenced by}} cognitive factors. Languages, such as English, that do not encode the alienability distinction in their grammar rely on the real-world relationship between the possessed noun and possessor noun. Nouns that are “inherently relational” and whose possession {{is associated with a}} single, dominant interpretation (e.g. mother), are of the <b>inalienable</b> type, whereas nouns whose possession is open to interpretation (e.g. car), are of the alienable type.|$|E
25|$|Marcel Mauss first {{described}} <b>inalienable</b> possessions {{in the classic}} anthropological text called The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous example, omission of the marker de is ungrammatical, as in example (29b). The linguistic distance between the possessor and possessee is much smaller for the example in (29b) than in (29a). It {{has been argued that}} omission of de only occurs in kinship relationships, whereas phrasal constructions with a mandatory de encompasses other <b>inalienable</b> possession examples such as body parts. This contradicts the notion that <b>inalienable</b> possession is marked by less linguistic distance between the possessor and possessee.|$|E
25|$|The British Museum {{continues}} {{to assert that}} it is an appropriate custodian and has an <b>inalienable</b> right to its disputed artefacts under British law.|$|E
25|$|Maurice Godelier {{has further}} {{elaborated}} on Annette Weiner's ideas on <b>inalienable</b> possessions in The Enigma of the Gift. He derived two theses from Weiner, {{to which he}} adds a third.|$|E
25|$|<b>Inalienable</b> {{possession}} {{can also}} be marked with external possession. These are constructions in which the possessor appears outside of the determiner phrase. For example, the possessor may appear as a dative complement of the verb.|$|E
25|$|Another way {{languages}} {{distinguish between}} alienable and <b>inalienable</b> possession {{is to have}} one noun class that cannot appear without an explicit possessor. For example, Ojibwe, an Algonquian language, has a class of nouns that must have explicit possessors.|$|E
25|$|Some {{advocates of}} right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this {{inconsistency}} in modern societies, arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting {{the notion of}} <b>inalienable</b> rights.|$|E
25|$|As for states' rights, while a state's {{right of}} {{revolution}} {{mentioned in the}} Declaration of Independence {{was based on the}} <b>inalienable</b> equal rights of man, secessionists believed in a modified version of states' rights that was safe for slavery.|$|E
25|$|Between 1992 and 2008, the Constitution of Republika Srpska was amended 121 times. Article1 {{states that}} Republika Srpska is a territorially unified, {{indivisible}} and <b>inalienable</b> constitutional and legal entity that shall independently perform its constitutional, legislative, executive, and judicial functions.|$|E
25|$|Malaysian court {{decisions}} from the 1950s on {{have held that}} customary lands were <b>inalienable.</b> In the 1970s, aboriginal rights were declared to be property rights, as protected by the Federal Constitution. Decisions in the 1970s and 1980s blocked state-sanctioned logging on customary land.|$|E
