5|$|One CMPC {{shooting}} {{location was}} on family property near Boulder Creek, California where Middleton's father {{had established a}} timber holding {{now known as the}} Middleton Tract. Other filming locations included undeveloped portions of Sonoma, Santa Cruz and Marin counties. In San Rafael, the studio boasted a large glass-walled and -roofed building that let in light but not wind so that shooting for indoor scenes could take place in <b>full</b> <b>light</b> without the telltale flapping of tablecloths and clothing blown by gusts. Considered expensive at the time, the company used a 1,250 Bell & Howell movie camera, worth about $ in current value. The camera held two reels of film so that two negatives were made of each scene. A second $700 camera provided a third reel of the same scene, from another perspective.|$|E
5|$|The {{portrait}} {{represents a}} man, estimated {{by some to}} be 45years of age, standing turned to the viewer's right, looking at the viewer with a commanding expression. In his uplifted right hand he holds a baton with a golden cap. He has a thick moustache and wears a high fur cap on which there is a golden chain with precious stones and a coat of arms in the center. From his ear a large pear-shaped pearl hangs from a golden pendant earring. He wears a reddish-brown mantle with a broad fur collar and, over it, a heavy gold chain from which the order of three horse tails, set in rich pendants, hangs on his right shoulder. A <b>full</b> <b>light</b> from the left falls {{on the right side of}} his face. The background is brownish-grey.|$|E

25|$|As in all mercury-based {{gas-filled}} tubes, {{mercury is}} slowly adsorbed onto the glass, phosphor, and tube electrodes throughout {{the life of}} the lamp, until it can no longer function. Loss of mercury will take over from failure of the phosphor in some lamps. The failure symptoms are similar, except loss of mercury initially causes an extended run-up time to <b>full</b> <b>light</b> output, and finally causes the lamp to glow a dim pink when the mercury runs out and the argon base gas takes over as the primary discharge.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 {{the first}} {{digitally}} controlled, full-LED glare-free adaptive highbeam is introduced by Audi on the facelifted Audi A8, with 25 individual LED segments (Matrix LED). The system dims light that would shine directly onto oncoming and preceding vehicles, but continues to cast its <b>full</b> <b>light</b> on the zones between and beside them. This works because the LED high beams are split into numerous individual light-emitting diodes. High-beam LEDs in both headlights {{are arranged in}} a matrix and adapt fully electronically to the surroundings in milliseconds. They are activated and deactivated or dimmed individually by a control unit. In addition, the headlights also function as a cornering light. Using predictive route data supplied by the MMI navigation plus, {{the focus of the}} beam is shifted towards the bend even before the driver turns the steering wheel. In 2014: Mercedes-Benz introduced a similar technology on the facelifted CLS-Class in 2014, called MULTIBEAM LED, with 24 individual segments.|$|E
25|$|VAM {{originally}} intended the Rally SST to include as standard equipment only the same accessories as the 1981 Rally GT and the optional equipment {{list of the}} 1981 Rally AMX except for its own share of exclusive and not available accessories. However, the same story as the 1980 Rally GT repeated itself for the 1981 Rally SST. The need to stress differences between not just the three-version Rally line but also the new Spirit-based Lerma model forced VAM to act any way it could. Once again, the company's sales department determined that virtually all Rally SST units included all optional convenience accessories available in the Rally line from the factory. The final list of equipment for the Rally SST consisted of a tinted windshield, intermittent wipers, rear defroster, electric antenna, <b>full</b> <b>light</b> group including reading dome light, AM-FM stereo radio, quartz clock, center console with compartment and armrest with rear ashtray, lighted vanity mirror, side armrest safety reflectors, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, locking glove box, leather wrapped sports steering wheel, inside hood release, air conditioning, parcel shelf, power door locks, power windows, power trunk release, dual remote-controlled mirrors, reclining bucket seats, retractable seatbelts, and removable trunk cover.|$|E

25|$|For him {{science was}} {{the means of}} exposing the immortal nucleus of the human soul. In the days of his full {{strength}} it furnished him recreation and, by the prospects which it opened up to him, gave consolation. Toward {{the end of his}} life it brought him confidence. Gauss' God was not a cold and distant figment of metaphysics, nor a distorted caricature of embittered theology. To man is not vouchsafed that fullness of knowledge which would warrant his arrogantly holding that his blurred vision is the <b>full</b> <b>light</b> and that there can be none other which might report truth as does his. For Gauss, not he who mumbles his creed, but he who lives it, is accepted. He believed that a life worthily spent here on earth is the best, the only, preparation for heaven. Religion is not a question of literature, but of life. God's revelation is continuous, not contained in tablets of stone or sacred parchment. A book is inspired when it inspires. The unshakeable idea of personal continuance after death, the firm belief in a last regulator of things, in an eternal, just, omniscient, omnipotent God, formed the basis of his religious life, which harmonized completely with his scientific research.|$|E
500|$|The two-story, International Style Science and Library Building, which {{includes}} a full basement, was built in 1959. [...] It is located at 103 North 12th Avenue, east of the main school building {{and south of the}} gymnasium. [...] The projecting one-story entrance, featuring four-bay store front windows with transoms and a pair of <b>full</b> <b>light</b> doors with transoms, is covered by a flat aluminum roof.

500|$|Scholars such as Charles Oman {{note that}} {{one element of}} the children's account, the entry into a {{different}} reality {{by way of a}} cave, seems to have been quite popular. Gerald of Wales tells a similar story of a boy who, after escaping his master, [...] "encountered two pigmies who led him through an underground passage into a beautiful land with fields and rivers, but not lit by the <b>full</b> <b>light</b> of the sun". But the motif is poorly attested; E. W. Baughman lists it as the only example of his F103.1 category of English and North American folk tale motifs: [...] "Inhabitants of lower world visit mortals, and continue to live with them". Martin Walsh considers the references to St Martin to be significant, and sees the story of the green children as evidence that the feast of Martinmas has its origins in an English aboriginal past, of which the children's story forms [...] "the lowest stratum". [...] suggests a Celtic connection in a 1900 edition of Notes and Queries: [...] "'Green' spirits are 'sinless' in Celtic literature and tradition... It may be more than a coincidence that the green girl marries a 'man of [...] Lynn.' Here the original [...] would be lein, evil, i.e. the pure fairy marries a sinful child of earth." ...|$|E

2500|$|The western aisle-end {{windows are}} alike. The {{stonework}} of {{the apex of}} each window on the outside {{is in the form}} of a Canterbury cross. The coloured glass around the cross is painted with a stylised sunburst. The two large lights forming the main part of the windows have no coloured glass, allowing <b>full</b> <b>light,</b> especially on the font in the south aisle. The west window consists of two sets of two lights. The small rose light in the right-hand window has the Star of David, and the rose in the left-hand window has the IHS symbol, derived originally from the first three letters of Jesus' name in ancient Greek, but usually translated as [...] "Christ the Redeemer". This window was made by Cox and Son, and paid for by the rector of Ripley, Reverend T.C. Thompson.|$|E
2500|$|Also new for 1977 was VAM's first {{station wagon}} {{that was not}} an economy base model, the first in 17 years. This model was not a new trim level but a package {{included}} with {{the order of the}} automatic transmission. Like the American GFS, the engine changed from the 258 six to the 282 cu in unit and the 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio. Like the American ECD, it shared the column-mounted gearshift and high-trim-upholstered bench seats (fold down rear unit) and special side panels. Accessories shared with both luxury sedans included power brakes, power steering, heavy duty suspension, bumper guards, full bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, [...] "4.6" [...] emblems (GFS only), tinted windshield, luxury steering wheel, electric analog clock, parcel shelf, <b>full</b> <b>light</b> group (except reading dome light) as well as all the general line novelties of the year. This created a luxury wagon {{for the first time in}} VAM's line up. The downside was that the economy base wagon would no longer be available with the option of an automatic transmission. VAM wagons with this package did not obtain a specific name since it was not a trim level, it was known within VAM and in printed materials as [...] "Camioneta Automática" [...] (automatic wagon). It would be until 1979 that it would officially obtain a designation, now based on the Concord-wagon, making [...] "American DL" [...] its full name.|$|E
2500|$|The Lerma is introduced, an {{original}} adaptation combining VAM American sedan with {{the rear of}} the smaller Rally creating a line of two- and four-door hatchbacks in a European style. The VAM American for 1981 in high trim included as standard equipment a rear defroster, reading dome lights, intermittent wipers, dual remote controlled mirrors, and AM/FM stereo radio. The option list now added a tilt steering column and power seats. All units had the AMC-designed Spirit grille for the year along with fan shroud and coolant recovery tank as standard equipment regardless of the presence of the air conditioning system. Appearance changes included [...] "Noryl" [...] wheel covers for the high trim versions. The base models were upgraded, and ordering any of the three body styles with automatic transmission now included as standard equipment: a quartz digital clock, retractable seat belts, tinted windshield, parcel shelf, <b>full</b> <b>light</b> group (except reading dome light), woodgrain panels applied on the dashboard, wheel trim rings, full bright molding package (hood, rocker panels, wheel lips, drip rails), and protective rubber side moldings aside from the already existing power steering and bumper guards. This meant a mid-range model between the standard basic units and the GFS/ECD/DL ones. This created for the first time an automatic base wagon that was not a DL. However, despite this change, VAM did not create any designation or distinction for the new better-equipped base models. In 1981 and 1982 there were four versions of the station wagon model: base manual, base automatic, basic DL, and equipped DL.|$|E

2500|$|The Rally-based Spirit liftbacks were {{available}} in two sports versions, the standard [...] "Rally AMX" [...] and the high performance [...] "Rally GT" [...] in their first year. Both versions came standard with a Transmission Technologies Corporation (Tremec) 176-F four-speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage, power brakes with front disks and rear drums, power steering, front and rear sway bars, heavy-duty shock absorbers and springs, seven-bladed flexible cooling fan, tinted windshield, leather-wrapped three-arm sports steering wheel, tachometer, center console with armrest and [...] "Rallye" [...] gauges plus rear ashtray, reclining bucket seats with adjustable headrests, split-back rear seat, three-point retractable seatbelts, woodgrain panels on dashboard, <b>full</b> <b>light</b> group (hood, courtesy, ashtray, glove box) except reading dome light, blacked-out dual remote-controlled mirrors and VAM-designed aluminum grille with a central [...] "Rally" [...] emblem. The Rally AMX had the standard [...] I6 using a 3.07:1 rear gear ratio, while the Rally GT came with the high-performance [...] version of this VAM engine and a 3.31:1 rear gear ratio. The heavy duty cooling system consisting of fan shroud and coolant recovery tank was optional on the AMX and standard on the GT, some units of this version came with a clutch fan instead of the regular belt-type. The Rally AMX was the [...] "base model" [...] {{of the line and}} the Rally GT was closer to the European tradition of performance cars with its analog tachometer (instead of the AMX's digital tach), while convenience items such as air conditioning or automatic transmission were not available. The GT model also included a rear spoiler with electric liftgate lock release and eight-spoke steel wheels (which were optional on the AMX). The AMX came with VAM's own design five-spoke wheels with trim rings and blacked-out volcano hubcaps. The marketing effort by VAM's sales department had most GT units be equipped from the factory with all the options originally intended to be extra cost, such as rear defroster, reading dome light, intermittent wipers, and AM FM stereo radio aside from the already mentioned steel wheels and rear spoiler. These items were all optional on the AMX.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 October 1946, Raeder {{was found}} guilty of {{conspiracy}} against the peace, conspiracy to commit aggression, and war crimes. Raeder expected a death sentence, and was deeply shocked when he received life imprisonment, which he regarded as a worse punishment than execution, complaining that as an old man spending {{the rest of his life}} in prison would be unbearable. Raeder formally asked the International Military Tribunal to be executed by firing squad instead, only to be informed that the Tribunal did not have the powers to change its sentence. At Spandau Prison, Raeder spent his days working in the prison library. When not working in the library, Raeder spent his time debating with the prison chaplain, the French Pastor Georges Casalis who believed that Raeder's soul might be saved if he confessed his guilt, and tried hard to save Raeder. Raeder for his part did not believe he was guilty of anything, and he rejected Casalis's attempts to save his soul. When not debating questions of guilt with Casalis, Raeder spent his free time continuing his war-time feud with Karl Dönitz. Dönitz was savage in his relentless attacks against Raeder for his [...] "policy of bloated surface vessels" [...] and for not spending enough money on building U-boats in the 1930s, a policy that Dönitz claimed had cost him victory in the Battle of the Atlantic. Dönitz told the former Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath that [...] "It had been Raeder's fault that until the middle of 1940 only two U-boats slid down the ways" [...] per month, and that if only he had been Navy Commander-in-Chief in 1940 then he would have won the war. In 1951, Dönitz learned that a British historian had written if only Germany had a larger U-boat fleet in 1939, then Dönitz might have won the Atlantic campaign, leading Dönitz to announce that once he was free, he would repeat that judgement [...] "in the <b>full</b> <b>light</b> of publicity" [...] to ruin Raeder's reputation once and for all. When not blaming each other for losing the Battle of the Atlantic, the two admirals fought over status. The authoritarian Raeder still continued to behave as if he was Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, and expected Dönitz to behave like a subordinate who only existed to take orders, a position that Dönitz utterly rejected. Dönitz was also a Grand Admiral, making him Raeder's equal, and he fiercely resented Raeder's patronising, condescending attitude. Because Hitler had appointed Dönitz his successor in his last will and testament, well into the 1950s the Nationalist Socialist fanatic Dönitz continued to insist that he was still President of Germany, and that the NSDAP should still be the only legal party in Germany. Since in his own mind, he was still Germany's leader, Dönitz saw himself as Raeder's superior, and expected Raeder to be his subordinate.|$|E
