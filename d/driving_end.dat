50|$|A drive {{center is}} used in the <b>driving</b> <b>end</b> of the machine (headstock). It {{consists}} of a dead center surrounded by hardened teeth. These teeth bite into the softer workpiece allowing the workpiece to be driven directly by the center. This allows the full diameter of the workpiece to be machined in a single operation, this contrasts with the usual requirement where a carrier is attached to the workpiece at the driven end. They are often used in woodworking or where softer materials are machined.|$|E

50|$|Coryates Halt {{was a small}} {{railway station}} on the Abbotsbury branch railway in {{the west of the}} English county of Dorset. It {{consisted}} of a single platform and GWR pagoda shelter. Opened on 1 May 1906, it was sited next to an overbridge carrying a lane to a dairy and the villages of Coryates and Shilvinghampton. Part of a scheme that saw several halts opened on the GWR and other railways to counter road competition, it was served by Railmotors, carriages equipped with <b>driving</b> <b>ends</b> and their own small steam engine.|$|R

Each car is fitted with a 294 kW MAN traction engine and a Cummins generator engine, both mounted underfloor. Each 4-car set is 81.46 m long, 3.985 m high and 2.9 m wide. They have a maximum permitted speed of 120 km/h (75 mph). Passenger capacity is 185 seated and 634 standing.|$|E
50|$|Signal {{termination}} {{often requires}} {{the installation of}} a terminator {{at the beginning and}} end of a wire or cable to prevent an RF signal from being reflected back from each end, causing interference, or power loss. The terminator is usually placed at the end of a transmission line or daisy chain bus (such as in SCSI), and is designed to match the AC impedance of the cable and hence minimize signal reflections, and power losses. Less commonly, a terminator is also placed at the <b>driving</b> <b>end</b> of the wire or cable, if not already part of the signal-generating equipment.|$|E

5000|$|The Wairarapa railcars were {{designed}} as {{an answer to}} this problem.

Their body was built higher than an ordinary railcar, with a raised floor, to enable them to pass over the raised Fell centre rail on the Rimutaka Incline. In design, they resembled a bus, and unlike a usual single-unit railcar that has a driving compartment at each end, the Wairarapa railcars only had one <b>driving</b> <b>end,</b> necessitating that they be turned at the terminus of their journey.|$|E

To {{broaden the}} {{application}} {{scope of the}} controllable overrunning clutch, a novel type Separable-Control Overrunning Clutch (SCOC) used in vehicle system has been designed by {{the authors of this}} paper.

Through the simulations, a series of comprehensive summary on the bidirectional engaging characteristic has been drawn and it could provide theoretical guidance for further prototype design and experimental research...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{ability to}} monitor our own errors is {{mediated}} by {{a network that}} includes dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and anterior insula (AI). However, {{the dynamics of the}} underlying neurophysiological processes remain unclear. In particular, whether AI is on the receiving or <b>driving</b> <b>end</b> of the error-monitoring network is unresolved. Here, we recorded intracerebral electroencephalography signals simultaneously from AI and dmPFC in epileptic patients while they performed a stop-signal task. We found that errors selectively modulated broadband neural activity in human AI. Granger causality estimates revealed that errors were immediately followed by a feedforward influence from AI onto anterior cingulate cortex and, subsequently, onto presupplementary motor area. The reverse pattern of information flow was observed on correct responses. Our findings provide the first direct electrophysiological evidence indicating that the anterior insula rapidly detects and conveys error signals to dmPFC, while the latter might use this input to adapt behavior following inappropriate actions...|$|E
