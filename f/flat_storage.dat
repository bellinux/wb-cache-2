50|$|After {{photographic}} {{materials are}} individually enclosed, housing or storage containers provide another protective barrier such as folders and boxes made from archival paperboard as addressed in ISO Standards 18916:2007 and 18902. Sometimes these containers {{have to be}} custom-made in order to properly store odd sizes. In general, <b>flat</b> <b>storage</b> in boxes is recommended because it provides more stable support, particularly for materials that are in more fragile condition. Still, boxes and folders should never be over-filled with materials.|$|E

The rear bench is split 50-50, with each section able to be slid forwards or backwards individually. Alternatively, folding or detaching the rear chairs provides a large and <b>flat</b> <b>storage</b> area. The rear seats can also be flipped downward to form a pair of beds. Because the gearshift is column-mounted there is no transmission tunnel, thus enabling oocupants to walk between front and rear seats.|$|E

ASD uses illustrations to communicate concepts and terminology more clearly with users. A feature of ASD allows an expert to change the design guidelines and factors.

40|$|Abstract. The {{huge amount}} of recent {{activities}} in peer-to-peer (P 2 P) computing {{led to the development}} of a number of applications and protocols all dealing with similar problems and providing different noninteroperable implementations. In this paper, we present a framework for resource management and information storage in P 2 P networks. Our framework aims at providing an easy to use and flexible model for P 2 P computing encouraging more modularized application development and permitting reuse of components. To provide efficient localization of resources and representation of information, our resource management framework (RMF) forms a distributed information space enabling not only <b>flat</b> <b>storage</b> of information but forming graph structures that can be used to build new kinds of applications enabling the users to browse the contents of a P 2 P network. ...|$|E
40|$|We have {{designed}} and implemented a C++ object layer for Khazana, a distributed persistent storage system that exports a flat shared address space as its basic abstraction. The C++ layer described herein lets programmers use familiar C++ idioms to allocate, manipulate, and deallocate persistent shared data structures. It handles the tedious details involved in accessing this shared data, replicating it, maintaining consistency, converting data representations between persistent and in-memory representations, associating type information including methods with objects, etc. To support the C++ object layer {{on top of}} Khazana's <b>flat</b> <b>storage</b> abstraction, we have developed a language-specific preprocessor that generates support code to manage the user-specified persistent C++ structures.

On the left, the baby is bathed by an attending woman, while another prepares blankets. Gottfried Chodowiecki (1728 Gdansk - 1781 Berlin) was a German painter and draftsman and the younger brother of Daniel Chodowiecki. The two brothers moved to Berlin in 1741 to be educated by their uncle. In 1754, Gottfried gave up working as a merchant to concentrate on his artistic career. He was a miniaturist and enameler, though he never gained such popularity as his brother, Daniel, who eventually employed him at his workshop as one of many assistant engravers.

40|$|P 2 P {{overlays}} offer {{a convenient}} way to host an infrastructure that can scale {{to the size}} of the Internet and yet manageable. Current proposals, however, do not offer support for structuring data, other than assuming a distributed hash table. In reality, both applications and users typically organize data in a structured form. One such popular structure is tree as employed in a file system, and a database.

In this paper, we investigate policies and strategies that place a tree onto the <b>flat</b> <b>storage</b> space of P 2 P systems. We found that, in general, there exists a tradeoff between lookup performance and balanced storage utilization, and attempts to balance these two requirements calls for intelligent placement decision. ...|$|E
40|$|Este trabalho aborda o desenvolvimento e a implantação de um projeto de armazenagem de componentes direto numa indústria de linha branca, na cidade de Rio Claro, {{interior}} do estado de São Paulo, o qual migrou de um modelo de armazenagem vertical, em porta-paletes, para um modelo horizontal sem o uso deste equipamento, denominado como <b>Flat</b> <b>Storage.</b> A preocupação desta pesquisa foi de apresentar ao público acadêmico interessado e aos profissionais da área de logística, o cenário anterior ao projeto e os motivos que levaram ao desenvolvimento desse conceito de armazenagem, o COMO foi realizada a implantação, o cenário posterior, juntamente com os benefícios encontrados, fazendo-se uma comparação com o cenário anterior. Por fim, faz-se uma convergência do modo como o projeto foi desenvolvido e implantado com as recomendações encontradas no PMBOK, principalmente no que diz respeito aos aspectos das Áreas de Conhecimento de Gestão de Projeto, com o intuito de mostrar como este trabalho deveria ter sido desenvolvido. Primeiramente, concluiu-se que os responsáveis pelo projeto não seguiram qualquer m̈etodologiad̈e gestão de projetos, pois as dificuldades encontradas evidenciaram tal descuido. Concluiu-se, também, que o modelo de armazenagem implantado, apesar de ser totalmente diferente daqueles encontrados em livros e na prática, foi muito bem aceito sob vários aspectos no cenário estudado.

Finally, a convergence is made of the way the project was developed and implanted in accordance with the recommendations found in the PMBOK guide, mainly under the aspects which are based on the areas of Knowledge of Project Management, bearing in mind to show how this project must have been developed. The first conclusion was that the responsible person for the project had difficulties {{due to the fact that}} the Project Management m̈ethodologyẅas not followed. Therefore, the difficulties encountered pointed to incautious evidences. We also concluded that the storage model implanted, although very much alike the trends found in books and in practical in use, was very well accepted under some aspects in the studied scene...|$|E
