The rings of lamination's are built into a skeleton frame which is flexibly supported inside the main stator frame to prevent double-frequency vibrations being transmitted to the foundations. Axial <b>gas</b> <b>passages</b> are provided within the core by holes punched in the lamination's, which line up throughout its length. The ends of the core are divided axially by spacers into a number of radial ducts. These ducts form the gas inlet and outlet passages for the axial <b>gas</b> <b>passages.</b> Separate radial ducts feed the extreme ends of the core with cold gas to cater for the increased heating experienced at the core ends during leading power factor operation. Each coil side of the stator winding consists of rectangular copper tubes, each tube being insulated with resin-impregnated glass braid, and the tubes are transposed within the coil length by the Roebel method to minimise stray copper losses. Inlet and outlet manifolds are arranged at opposite ends of the windings and all coil sides are fed in parallel from these. The water connections between the manifolds and coil sides are made with flexible hoses of insulating material. The electrical connections between coil sides consist of flexible copper straps, bolted and sweated to contact blocks which are brazed to the conductor tubes near to the end of each coil side. The rings used to connect up the phase groups to the terminals are also water cooled, the flow through these being in parallel with the flow through the coil sides.|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. One {{of the problems of}} natural gas pressure reduction stations (City Gate Stations; CGS) is blocking the <b>gas</b> <b>passage</b> due to reduction of temperature in the regulator. In order to prevent this problem, gas is heated in a gas heater before pressure dropping. The gas heater includes, <b>gas</b> <b>passage</b> pipes, intermediate fluid and hot fluid passage pipes. Hot fluid is combustion products of an atmospheric burner and has high thermal energy. Since utilizing of porous media technology has many advantages in combustion systems, the idea of applying this type of burners instead of conventional burners has been widely considered. In this study, replacing of an atmospheric burner with a porous burner in the gas heater of a CGS has been studied numerically. First, by modelling the gas heater with an atmospheric burner, the values of produced heat fluxes at the different equivalence ratios have been studied. The results of these simulations determine the condition which leads to maximum efficiency of combustion in the atmospheric burner. The results indicate that maximum thermal efficiency of the atmospheric burner is obtained in 60 percent of the primary air. In the next step, by modelling the gas heater with a porous burner at various sizes and various equivalence ratios, produced heat fluxes were calculated and compared with those of the atmospheric burner. According to the results, although the gas heater of the pressure reduction station has not been designed for a porous burner, but utilizing a porous burner instead of the atmospheric burner, causes the thermal performance of the heater to increase. The increase of thennal performance at lean equivalence ratios is higher. ej 201...|$|E

25|$|As magma {{nears the}} surface and its {{pressure}} decreases, gases escape. This process is much like {{what happens when you}} open a bottle of fizzy drink and carbon dioxide escapes. Sulfur dioxide {{is one of the main}} components of volcanic gases, and increasing amounts of it herald the arrival of increasing amounts of magma near the surface. For example, on May 13, 1991, an increasing amount of sulfur dioxide was released from Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. On May 28, just two weeks later, sulfur dioxide emissions had increased to 5,000 tonnes, ten times the earlier amount. Mount Pinatubo later erupted on June 12, 1991. On several occasions, such as before the Mount Pinatubo eruption and the 1993 Galeras, Colombia eruption, sulfur dioxide emissions have dropped to low levels prior to eruptions. Most scientists believe that this drop in gas levels is caused by the sealing of <b>gas</b> <b>passages</b> by hardened magma. Such an event leads to increased pressure in the volcano's plumbing system and an increased chance of an explosive eruption. A multi-component gas analyzer system (Multi-GAS) is an instrument package used to take real-time high-resolution measurements of volcanic gas plumes. Multi-GAS measurements of CO2/SO2 ratios can allow detection of the pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas, improving prediction of volcanic activity.|$|R
