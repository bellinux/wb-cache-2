40|$|Since Hotelling's (1929) seminal work, {{economists have}} tried to {{understand}} how product differentiation affects price competition.

I find a Nash Equilibrium in which each firm differentiates its product completely from its horizontal competitor.

50|$|As {{with any}} contract, {{there are a}} number of risks {{associated}} with contract farming. Common problems include farmers selling to a buyer other than the one with whom they hold a contract (known as side selling, extra-contractual marketing or, in the Philippines, “pole vaulting”), or using <b>inputs</b> <b>supplied</b> by the company for purposes other than intended.

50|$|Because {{the device}} would conduct a nearly {{unlimited}} amount of current, {{there must be}} some external means of limiting the current. Usually, this is provided by an external resistor upstream from the VR tube. The VR tube then conducts any portion of the current that does not flow into the downstream load, maintaining an approximately constant voltage across the VR tube's electrodes. The VR tube's regulation voltage was only guaranteed when conducting an amount of current within the allowable range. In particular, if the current through the tube is too low to maintain ionization, the output voltage can rise above the nominal output—as far as the <b>input</b> <b>supply</b> voltage. If the current through the tube is too high, it can enter an arc discharge mode where the voltage will be significantly lower than nominal and the tube may be damaged.|$|E
50|$|A major {{subset of}} value chain {{development}} work {{is concerned with}} ways of linking producers to companies, and hence into the value chains. While there are examples of fully integrated value chains that do not involve smallholders (e.g. Unilever operates tea estates and tea processing facilities in Kenya and then blends and packs the tea in Europe before selling it as Lipton, Brooke Bond or PG Tips brands), the great bulk of agricultural value chains involve sales to companies from independent farmers. Such arrangements frequently involve contract farming in which the farmer undertakes to supply agreed quantities of a crop or livestock product, based on the quality standards and delivery requirements of the purchaser, often at a price that is established in advance. Companies often also agree to support the farmer through <b>input</b> <b>supply,</b> land preparation, extension advice and transporting produce to their premises.|$|E
