500|$|The {{title of}} the book is drawn from the dissenting opinion by Supreme Court Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in United States v. Schwimmer. Holmes wrote that [...] "if there is any {{principle}} of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other, it is the principle of free thought—not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate." [...] Lewis warns the reader against the potential <b>for</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> take advantage of periods of fear and upheaval in a post-9/11 society to suppress freedom of speech and criticism by citizens.|$|E

Whereas YouTube's inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted, the YouTube content creators' new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website's distracting content and fickle audience.|$|E

2500|$|A {{major cause}} of {{economic}} inequality within modern market economies is the determination of wages by the market.

2500|$|Australia's head {{of state}} is the monarch, and its head of {{government}} is the prime minister, with powers limited by both law and convention <b>for</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> be carried on democratically. The constitution provides that the Queen {{is part of the}} Parliament and is empowered to appoint the Governor-General as her representative, while the executive power of the Commonwealth which is vested in the Queen is exercisable by the Governor-General as her representative. In practice, the Queen does not play a day-to-day role in the government, and the few functions which the Queen does perform (such as appointing the Governor-General) are done on advice from the prime minister. The constitution does not directly mention the term [...] "{{head of state}}". The Constitution defines the Governor-General and the State governors as the monarch's representatives.|$|E

He claims he was told by the official to [...] "follow the arrangements set out by the government", and was further threatened: [...] "If this suggestion is disobeyed, the lawyer and the firm will be dealt with."

2500|$|Moynihan issued his {{research}} {{under the title}} , now commonly known as The Moynihan Report. Moynihan's report fueled a debate over the proper course <b>for</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> take {{with regard to the}} economic underclass, especially blacks. Critics on the left attacked it as [...] "blaming the victim", a slogan coined by psychologist William Ryan. Some suggested that Moynihan was propagating the views of racists because much of the press coverage of the report focused on the discussion of children being born out of wedlock. Despite Moynihan's warnings, the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program included rules for payments only if no [...] "Man [...] in the house." [...] Critics said that the nation was paying poor women to throw their husbands out of the house. Moynihan went on to formulate Richard Nixon's idea of a Guaranteed Annual Income (GAI) and conducted significant discussions concerning a Basic Income Guarantee with Russell B. Long and Louis O. Kelso.|$|E

2500|$|Simpson {{began his}} {{professional}} {{career as a}} physicist in 1943 where he acted as a group leader on the Manhattan Project. The Manhattan Project was the codename for a United States project with the United Kingdom and Canada conducted during World War II to develop the first atomic bombs. It was common <b>for</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> recruit physicists during World War II for such tasks. Simpson had taken up the offer after recognizing the social and human implications of nuclear energy and wanted to partake in its development. [...] Because of this, Simpson became a founding member and first chairman of the Atomic Scientists of Chicago, founded {{two years after the}} start of his career in August 1945, a day after the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. He was also a co-founder that same year of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. This bulletin's aim was to spell out the implications of the atomic bomb, as well as to provide rational courses of action in response to the implications. In the October 29, 1945 issue of Life, Simpson, along with Eugene Rabinowitch spoke about their involvement with nuclear energy, and said that scientists for the first time had recognized a moral responsibility to carry the warning of the danger of any further use of nuclear weapons. He felt that scientists and engineers could no longer remain aloof from the consequences of their work.|$|E

50|$|Many {{different}} organizations apply crowdsourcing {{to gather}} and assess information.

Whether all the tribes choose to send in and accept our terms, or not, makes no very great difference; they have had such a sharp lesson that it will certainly be some time before they rise again in revolt.

60|$|The very {{existence}} of majorities and minorities is indicative of an immoral state. The man whose character harmonises with the moral law, we found to be one who can obtain complete happiness without diminishing the happiness of his fellows. But the enactment of public arrangements by vote implies a society consisting of men otherwise constituted--implies that the desires of some cannot be satisfied without sacrificing the desires of others--implies that {{in the pursuit of}} their happiness the majority inflict a certain amount of unhappiness on the minority--implies, therefore, organic immorality. Thus, from another point of view, we again perceive that even in its most equitable form it is impossible <b>for</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> dissociate itself from evil; and further, that, unless the right to ignore the State is recognised, its acts must be essentially criminal.|$|E
60|$|It is the {{interest}}, {{and it is}} the duty, {{and because}} it is the interest and the duty, it is the right of government to attend much to opinions; because, as opinions soon combine with passions, even when they do not produce them, they have much influence on actions. Factions are formed upon opinions; which factions become in effect bodies corporate in the state;--nay, factions generate opinions in order to become a centre of union, and to furnish watch-words to parties; and this may make it expedient <b>for</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> forbid things in themselves innocent and neutral.
