40|$|Abstract — In {{orthogonal}} <b>frequency-division</b> <b>multiplex</b> access (OFDMA) uplink, it {{is admitted}} that the carrier-frequency offsets (CFOs) between multi-transmitter and receiver introduce inter-carrier interference (ICI) and cause severe performance loss. In this paper, with reference to {{a detailed analysis of}} the ICI caused by CFOs, we propose a novel low-complexity iterative ICI cancellation algorithm, which is based on the perfect estimation of each user’s CFO. Moreover, the convergence behaviors of the iter-ations are studied with three theorems, and the user-interleaving patterns suitable for this algorithm are presented. In accordance with the simulation results, we {{come to the conclusion that}} the low-complexity iterative algorithm can effectively suppress and cancel the ICI due to CFOs.

40|$|Abstract—Channels with {{spectral}} nulls {{are sometimes}} dubbed bad channels {{because they can}} cause poor performance in communication systems. This correspondence investigates the validity of this intuition by studying the geometry of an orthogonal <b>frequency-division</b> <b>multiplex</b> (OFDM) system. It is shown that the subchannel attenuation coefficients form a natural coordinate system for describing finite-impulse response (FIR) channels in an OFDM framework. It is also shown that channels with spectral nulls are geometrically significant; they form {{the faces of the}} convex set of all subchannel attenuation coefficients. This novel perspective makes it immediately clear why the worst performance of a linearly precoded OFDM system is achieved over a channel having the greatest number of spectral nulls. The practical implications of these results are discussed in the correspondence.

In this paper, we focus on OFDM (Orthogonal <b>Frequency-Division</b> <b>Multiplex)</b> based overlay systems, which share a frequency band with already existing systems by adaptively filling the spectral holes. In order to enable such a co-existence, on the physical (PHY) layer promising methods for minimising mutual interference between the overlay system and the licensed system are presented. The medium-access control (MAC) layer protocols are designed such as to be able to efficiently signal the available subcarriers as well as to handle the changing available bandwidth. A third issue is the joint optimisation of PHY and MAC parameters which is essential in order to optimally exploit the available spectrum with minimum signalling overhead...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Multicarrier and single-carrier block-based {{transceivers}} {{with minimum}} redundancy {{have proved to}} be an alternative to classical orthogonal <b>frequency-division</b> <b>multiplex</b> (OFDM) and single-carrier with frequency-domain equalization (SC-FD) systems. In general, these minimum-redundancy transceivers have superior throughput performance than OFDM and SC-FD systems, requiring the same asymptotic complexity, viz. O(M log 2 M), forM data symbols. However, the previous proposals of such transceivers rely on the channel-state information (CSI) assumption. In addition, they also assume that the equalizer was previously designed, focusing on the equalization problem only. The aim of this work is to present some theoretical results related to the design of the equalizers that employ minimum redundancy, without assuming CSI. The key result {{of this paper is to}} show that it is possible to design those equalizers based on pilot information and using fast-converging iterative algorithms that require O(M log 2 M) operations per iteration.

The coherent heterodyning of two injection locked SL's results in a very narrow intermediate frequency linewidth. A future CATV-system using injection locking can be operated with transmitter and local lasers in the central office. Another possibility is to allocate the transmitter SL in the central office and the local SL within the receiver. In this case the local SL has to be locked to a phase coherent pilot tone...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{orthogonal}} frequency-division {{multiple access}} (OFDMA), closely spaced multiple subcarriers {{are assigned to}} different users for parallel signal transmission. An interleaved subcarrier-assignment scheme is preferred because it provides maximum frequency diversity and increases the capacity in frequency-selective fading channels. The subcarriers are overlapping, but orthogonal to each other such {{that there is no}} intercarrier interference (ICI). Carrier-frequency offsets (CFOs) between the transmitter and the receiver destroy the orthogonality and introduces ICI, resulting in multiple-access interference. This paper exploits the inner structure of the signals for CFO estimation in the uplink of interleaved OFDMA systems. A new uplink signal model is presented, and an estimation algorithm based on the signal structure is proposed for estimating the CFOs of all users using only one OFDMA block. Diversity schemes are also presented to improve the estimation performance. Simulation results illustrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

We present Monte Carlo simulations of OFDM modulation in which a group or groups of subcarriers are modulated using quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation and 16 -ary quadrature amplitude modulations (16 QAM). We show that turning off some subcarriers {{does not affect the}} performance as long as the effective Eb/No remains the same. We also present Monte Carlo simulations where the power ratio of two sets of subcarriers is changed while maintaining the same total power in order to investigate the effect on performance. Finally, we consider a two-user CR scenario and investigate the performance effect on a primary user by a secondary user in terms of various Doppler shift offsets where both the primary user and secondary user use OFDM modulations.
