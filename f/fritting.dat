40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) was {{requested}} to provide Savannah River Remediation (SRR) with a recommended <b>frit</b> composition for Sludge Batch 6 (SB 6) to optimize processing at the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). This report discusses {{the results of}} a series of melt rate experiments that were completed in support of the <b>frit</b> recommendation and the preparation of the feed used in the testing. The objective of the work was to identify the impact of individual <b>frit</b> component concentrations on melt rate for both SB 6 and for DWPF sludge batches in general. The dry fed, Melt Rate Furnace (MRF) was used to compare the relative melt rate performance of several candidate <b>frit</b> compositions. Sludge composition projection changes and variation led to the fabrication and testing of several new <b>frits</b> along with <b>Frit</b> 418, which is currently utilized at the DWPF for Sludge Batch 5 (SB 5) processing. The melt rate testing results show that changes in the <b>frit</b> composition, such as increases in B{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } or Li{sub 2 }O concentrations, can provide a faster melt rate for SB 6 relative to <b>Frit</b> 418. However, the composition of SB 6 as currently projected (February 2010 blended with a 40 inch heel of SB 5) does not allow for significant changes in <b>frit</b> composition relative to <b>Frit</b> 418 without compromising the projected operating windows. Only one of the new <b>frits</b> tested, <b>Frit</b> IS 7, remains viable for SB 6 processing based on the current composition projections. The melt rate results also demonstrated that a low Na{sub 2 }O concentration <b>frit</b> (particularly <b>Frit</b> IS 7) can provide reasonable melt rates if the concentrations of Li{sub 2 }O or B{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } in the <b>frit</b> are increased. The measured melt rate for <b>Frit</b> IS 7 with the simulated SB 6 feed was about 15 % faster than that for <b>Frit</b> 418. The projected operating windows for <b>Frits</b> 418 and IS 7 are very similar with the current SB 6 projections. However, waste loadings with <b>Frit</b> IS 7 are limited by low viscosity predictions, while waste loadings with <b>Frit</b> 418 are limited by predictions of nepheline crystallization. It is recommended that SRNL reevaluate the final SB 6 composition once washing and blending are complete to determine whether a change in <b>frit</b> composition could provide improved operating windows, improved sulfate solubility, and/or increased waste throughput...|$|R

50|$|The colour {{of glass}} could be {{affected}} by many factors. Sources of silica were often impure, with iron oxide {{being one of the}} most common impurities. The greenish hue of uncoloured glass is usually owing to the presence of a mixture of ferrous (Fe2+) and ferric (Fe3+) ions in the glass matrix. It is also possible that ‘impurities’ could be introduced at the <b>fritting</b> stage within the glass furnace, leading to the addition of further alumina, silica and iron oxides.|$|E

50|$|In the {{application}} method, formerly {{assumed to be}} the only one used for faience glazing; silica, lime and alkalis are ground in the raw state to a small particle size, thus mixed in water to form a slurry which is then applied to the quartz core.

The slurry can be then applied to the body, through brushing or dipping, to create a fine, powdery coating. Upon firing, the water from the melting glaze partially diffuses in the sand body, sintering the quartz particles and thus creating some solid bridges in the body.|$|E
40|$|DWPF mixes a slurry {{of glass}} <b>frit</b> (<b>Frit</b> 418) and dilute (1. 5 wt%) formic acid {{solution}} with high level {{waste in the}} Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME). There would be advantages to introducing the <b>frit</b> in a non-slurry form to minimize water addition to the SME, however, adding completely dry <b>frit</b> {{has the potential to}} generate dust which could clog filters or condensers. Prior testing with another type of <b>frit,</b> <b>Frit</b> 320, and using a minimal amount of water reduced dust generation, however, the formation of hard clumps was observed. To examine options and behavior, a TTQAP [McCabe and Stone, 2013] was written to initiate tests that would address these concerns. Tests were conducted with four types of glass frit; <b>Frit</b> 320, DWPF <b>Frit</b> 418, Bekeson <b>Frit</b> 418 and Multi-Aspirator <b>Frit</b> 418. The last two <b>frits</b> are chemically identical to DWPF <b>Frit</b> 418 but smaller particles were removed by the respective vendors. Test results on <b>Frit</b> Clumping and Dusting are provided in this report. This report addresses the following seven questions. Short answers are provided below with more detailed answers to follow. 1. Will the addition of a small amount of water, 1. 5 wt%, to dry DWPF <b>Frit</b> 418 greatly reduce the dust generation during handling at DWPF? a. Yes, a small scale test showed that adding a little water to the <b>frit</b> greatly reduced dust generation during handling. 2. Will the addition of small amounts of water to the <b>frit</b> cause clumping that will impair <b>frit</b> handling at DWPF? a. No, not with <b>Frit</b> 418. Although clumps were observed to form when 1. 5 wt% water was mixed with DWPF <b>Frit</b> 418, then compressed and air-dried overnight, the clumps were easily crushed and did not form the hardened material noted when <b>Frit</b> 320 was tested. 3. What is the measured size distribution of dust generated when dry <b>frit</b> is handled? (This affects the feasibility and choice of processing equipment for removing the dust generating fraction of the <b>frit</b> before it is added to the SME.) a. The size distribution for the dust removed from fresh DWPF <b>Frit</b> 418 while it was being shaken in a small scale LabRAM test was measured. The median size on a volume basis was 7. 6 &# 956;m and 90 % of the <b>frit</b> particles were between 1. 6 and 28 &# 956;m. The mass of dust collected using this test protocol was much less than 1 % of the original <b>frit.</b> 4. Can the dust be removed in a small number of processing steps and without the larger <b>frit</b> particles continuing to spall additional dust sized particles? a. Test results using a LabRAM were inconclusive. The LaRAM performs less efficient particle size separation than the equipment used by Bekeson and Multi-Aspirator. 5. What particle size of <b>frit</b> is expected to create a dust problem? a. The original criterion for creating a dusting problem was those particle sizes that were readily suspended when being shaken. For that criterion calculations and Microtrac size analyses indicated that particles smaller than 37 &# 956;m are likely dust generators. Subsequently a more sophisticated criterion for dust problem was considered, particle sizes that would become suspended in the air flow patterns inside the SME and possibly plug the condenser. That size may be larger than 37 &# 956;m but has not yet been determined. 6. If particles smaller than 37 &# 956;m are removed will bulk dust generation be eliminated? a. Video-taped tests were performed using three gallons each of three types of <b>frit</b> 418, DWPF <b>frit,</b> Bekeson <b>frit</b> and Multi-Aspirator <b>frit.</b> <b>Frit</b> was poured through air from a height of approximately eight feet into a container half filled with water. Pouring Bekeson <b>frit</b> or Multi-Aspirator <b>frit</b> generated markedly less visible dust, but there was still a significant amount, which still has the potential of causing a dust problem. 7. Can completely dry <b>frit</b> be poured into the SME without having dust plug the condenser {{at the top of the}} vessel? a. Because of the complexity of air currents inside the SME and the difficulty of defensible size scaling a more prototypical test will be required to answer this question. We recommend construction of a full scale mockup of the top half of the SME with a shallow basin of water at the bottom and a simulated condenser at the top. It could be made from simple materials such as PVC pipe, cardboard and clear plastic and tested with dry <b>frit.</b> Depending on results, this may need to be coupled with the proposed pneumatic transfer system...|$|R
40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) {{began using}} <b>Frit</b> 418 with SB 3 in early 2004. Additional <b>Frit</b> 418 was {{necessary}} to continue running, but a significant cost savings would be achieved if an interim <b>frit</b> could be used and the purchase of <b>Frit</b> 418 delayed until FY 05. A large quantity of <b>Frit</b> 202 was available and it was proposed to use this material until additional <b>Frit</b> 418 was obtained. A series of dry-fed tests (using the Melt Rate Furnace or MRF) and slurry fed tests (using the Slurry-Fed Melt Rate Furnace or SMRF) have been performed to investigate the effect of <b>Frit</b> 202 on the melt rate of the SB 3 system. Initial MRF testing indicated about a 20 percent decrease in melt rate when substituting <b>Frit</b> 202 for <b>Frit</b> 418. More recent tests with both the MRF and SMRF have shown a 10 - 35 percent decrease in rate using <b>Frit</b> 202. MRF testing indicated that the addition of sodium hydroxide would mitigate {{a majority of the}} melt rate loss associated with <b>Frit</b> 202. When NaOH was tested in the SMRF, the quantity that could be added was limited due to total organic carbon concerns from the additional formic acid required, to balance the hydroxide addition. SMRF testing with NaOH showed no increase in melt rate, but the NaOH addition was only 58 percent of that used in the dry feed test. No major processing problems were indicated when testing <b>Frit</b> 202, but the feed does have a greater tendency to mound than feeds using <b>Frit</b> 418, when tested in the SMRF.

50|$|Evidence {{of the use}} {{of green}} <b>frit</b> is so far {{confined}} to Egypt. Alongside malachite, green <b>frit</b> was usually employed as a green pigment. Its earliest occurrence is in tomb paintings of the 18th dynasty, but its use extends at least to the Roman period. The manufacture of green and blue <b>frit</b> relies on the same raw materials, but in different proportions. To produce green <b>frit,</b> the lime concentration must outweigh the copper concentration. The firing temperature required for green <b>frit</b> may be slightly higher than that of blue <b>frit,</b> in the range of 950 to 1100°C. The ultimate product is composed of copper-wollastonite (Ca,Cu3Si3O9) crystals and a “glassy phase rich in copper, sodium, and potassium chlorides.” In certain circumstances (the use of a two-step heating process, the presence of hematite), scientists were able to make a cuprorivaite-based blue <b>frit</b> that later became a copper-wollastonite-based green <b>frit</b> at a temperature of 1050°C. On some ancient Egyptian wall paintings, pigments that were originally blue are now green: the blue <b>frit</b> can “devitrify” so that the “copper wollastonite predominates over the lesser component of cuprorivaite.” As with blue <b>frit,</b> Hatton, Shortland, and Tite have analyzed evidence for green <b>frit</b> at Amarna in the form of cakes, powders, and one vessel fragment and inferred the sequential production of the three types of artifacts.|$|R

40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) <b>Frit</b> Development Team {{recommends}} that the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) utilize <b>Frit</b> 418 for initial processing of high level waste (HLW) Sludge Batch 5 (SB 5).

40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) {{canister}} {{production rate}} must be increased to meet canister production goals. Although {{a number of}} factors exist that could potentially increase melt rate, this study focused on two: (1) changes in <b>frit</b> composition and (2) changes to the feed preparation process to alter the redox of the melter feed. These two factors were investigated for Macrobatch 2 (sludge batch 1 B) utilizing crucible studies and a specially designed ''melt rate'' furnace. Other potential factors that could increase melt rate include: mechanical mixing via stirring or the use of bubblers, changing the power skewing to redistribute the power input to the melter, and elimination of heat loss (e. g. air in leakage). The melt rate testing in FY 00 demonstrated that melt rate can be improved by adding a different <b>frit</b> or producing a much more reducing glass by the addition of sugar as a reductant. The <b>frit</b> that melted the fastest in the melt rate testing was <b>Frit</b> 165.

PCCS indicated that the window was very similar for both <b>frits.</b> In addition, the predicted viscosity of the <b>frit</b> 165 glass was 46 poise versus 84 poise for the <b>Frit</b> 200 glass. As a result, a change from <b>Frit</b> 200 to <b>Frit</b> 165 is expected to increase the melt rate in DWPF without decreasing waste loading...|$|R

50|$|The fluxing and {{refractive}} properties {{valued for}} lead glass {{also make it}} attractive as a pottery or ceramic glaze. Lead glazes first appear in first century BC to first century AD Roman wares, and occur nearly simultaneously in China.

Annealing (glass) and glass blowing probably occurred using a smaller furnace. Cullet heaps of broken glass residue were found on either side, suggesting the use of a flux to reduce melting temperatures.

This report documents the results of SRNL's efforts to identify candidate <b>frit</b> compositions and corresponding predicted operating windows (defined in terms of WL intervals) for the February 2007 compositional projection of Sludge Batch 4 (SB 4) developed by the Liquid Waste Organization (LWO). The nominal compositional projection was used to assess projected operating windows (in terms of a waste loading interval over which all predicted properties were classified as acceptable) for various <b>frits,</b> evaluate the applicability of the 0. 6 wt% SO{sub 4 }{sup =} PCCS limit to the glass systems of interest, and determine the impact (or lack thereof) to the previous SB 4 variability studies. It should be mentioned that the information from this report will be coupled with assessments of melt rate to recommend a <b>frit</b> for SB 4 processing. The results of this paper study suggest that candidate <b>frits</b> are available to process the nominal SB 4 composition over attractive waste loadings of interest to DWPF. Specifically, two primary candidate <b>frits</b> for SB 4 processing, <b>Frit</b> 510 and <b>Frit</b> 418, have projected operating windows that should allow for successful processing at DWPF. While <b>Frit</b> 418 has been utilized at DWPF, <b>Frit</b> 510 is a higher B{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } based <b>frit</b> which could lead to improvements in melt rate. These <b>frits</b> provide relatively large operating windows and demonstrate robustness to possible sludge compositional variation while avoiding potential nepheline formation issues. In addition, assessments of SO{sub 4 }{sup =} solubility indicate that the 0. 6 wt% SO{sub 4 }{sup =} limit in PCCS is applicable for the <b>Frit</b> 418 and the <b>Frit</b> 510 based SB 4 glass systems...|$|R
50|$|For ground coats, the {{composition}} of a <b>frit</b> for any given application is determined primarily by the metal used as the substrate: different varieties of steel, and different metals such as aluminium and copper, require different <b>frit</b> compositions to bond to them. For cover coats the <b>frit</b> is composed to both bind to the ground-coat and produce the desired external properties. <b>Frit</b> is normally prepared by mixing the ingredients and then milling the mixture into a powder. The ingredients, most often metal oxides and minerals such as quartz (or silica sand), soda ash, borax, and cobalt oxide, are acquired in particulate form; the precise chemical composition and amount of each ingredient must be carefully measured and regulated. Once prepared, this powdered <b>frit</b> is then smelted and stirred to promote even distribution of materials; most <b>frits</b> are smelted at temperatures between 1150 and 1300°C. After smelting, the <b>frit</b> is again milled into a powder, most often by ball mill grinding.|$|R
