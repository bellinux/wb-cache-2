Major Hassan has been charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder, and 32 counts of attempted murder. As with all pending UCMJ matters, the accused is <b>innocent</b> <b>until</b> <b>proven</b> <b>guilty.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Italy, {{individuals}} {{accused of}} any crime are considered <b>innocent</b> <b>until</b> <b>proven</b> <b>guilty,</b> although the defendant may {{be held in}} detention. Unless the accused opts for a fast-track trial, murder cases are heard by a corte d'assise (English translation: court of assizes). A guilty verdict is not regarded as a definitive conviction until the accused has exhausted the appeals process, irrespective {{of the number of}} times the defendant has been put on trial.|$|E
25|$|Article 87 of the Basic Law and Article 11 of the Bill of Rights {{provides}} that anyone {{charged with a}} criminal offence shall {{have the right to}} be presumed <b>innocent</b> <b>until</b> <b>proven</b> <b>guilty</b> according to law. This presumption is well established under the common law; the much-celebrated case of Woolmington v DPP laid down the basic criminal law principle that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the defendant's guilt subject to the defence of insanity and statutory exceptions. If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant committed the criminal offence in question, the prosecution has not made out the case and the defendant is entitled to an acquittal.|$|E

25|$|On 8 June 2012 the General Elections Committee (GEC) {{refused to}} {{register}} Enkhbayar {{as a candidate}} for 2012 parliamentary elections in MPRP party list listed as number one. It stated that the official documents sent from the Prosecutor's Office and Sukhbaatar District Court of Ulaanbaatar required the rejection of Enkhbayar's application pending the case. However, Enkhbayar and his lawyers argue that the incumbent president, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, who took office in 2009, engineered the corruption case to keep him from running in the coming elections. They claim that the court gave them insufficient time to review the prosecutors' evidence and witness statements. The election authorities' denial of Enkhbayar's candidacy on 6 June, they say, violates his constitutional right to be considered <b>innocent</b> <b>until</b> <b>proven</b> <b>guilty.</b> According to a US-based independent trial observer, the five charges levelled against Enkhbayar seem overblown and unsubstantiated. One accuses him of misappropriating TV equipment that was intended for a Buddhist monastery. Another alleges that he illegally shipped eight copies of his autobiography to South Korea on a government plane.|$|E

After learning that {{the statute of limitations}} on these allegations had expired and thus could not be tried, she called for Cosby to answer the allegations, and began advising women to come forward if they are raped.|$|E

In protest at having to wear a prison uniform and what he interpreted to be breaches of prison rules, Nilsen threatened to protest against his remand conditions by refusing to wear any clothes; {{as a result of this}} threat, he was not allowed to leave his cell. On 1 August, Nilsen threw the contents of his chamber pot out of his cell, hitting several prison officers. This incident resulted in Nilsen being found guilty on 9 August of assaulting prison officers and subsequently spending 56 days in solitary confinement.|$|E
2500|$|National Human Rights Commission, in February 2000 {{recommended}} {{repeal of}} the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952. Later in March 2007, the UN's anti-discrimination body Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), noted that [...] "the so-called denotified and nomadic which are listed for their alleged 'criminal tendencies' under the former Criminal Tribes Act (1871), continue to be stigmatised under the Habitual Offenders Act (1952) (art. 2 (1)), and asked India to repeal the Habitual Offenders Act (1952) and effectively rehabilitate the denotified and nomadic tribes. According to the body, since much of 'Habitual Offenders Act (1952)' {{is derived from the}} earlier 'Criminal Tribes Act 1871', it doesn't show a marked departure in its intent, only gives the formed notified tribes a new name i.e. Denotified tribes, hence the stigma continues so does the oppression, as the law is being denounced on two counts, first that [...] "all human beings are born free and equal", and second that it negates a valuable principle of the criminal justice system– <b>innocent</b> <b>until</b> <b>proven</b> <b>guilty.</b>|$|E

[...] The Japan Pro Boxing Association alleged that prejudice against boxers was involved, and said the principle of <b>innocent</b> <b>until</b> <b>proven</b> <b>guilty</b> had been violated because of rampant press reports declaring Hakamada guilty.

I will break this iron chain and return to you." [...] Although Hakamada remained on death row, he was not executed because the Minister of Justice refused to sign his death warrant, suspecting that the conviction was not certain. Like most death row inmates, Hakamada was placed in solitary confinement throughout his prison stay. He was not permitted to talk to guards, and rarely allowed visitors.|$|E
