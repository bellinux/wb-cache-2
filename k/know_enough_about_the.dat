However, Dempsey did not apologise, saying he did not <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> incident and an inquiry was still being conducted. A senior advisor to Afghan President Hamid Karzai warned that Pakistan and Afghanistan may be on a course toward military conflict. Hamid Karzai contacted the Pakistani Prime Minister to discuss the NATO strike and gave his condolences over the deaths of soldiers.|$|E
500|$|The {{criticism}} of Vrba {{stems from the}} tension between what Ruth Linn calls survivor and expert discourse. Bauer referred to Vrba's memoir as [...] "not a memoir in the usual sense", alleging that it [...] "contains excerpts of conversations of {{which there is no}} chance that they are accurate and it has elements of a second-hand story that does not necessarily correspond with reality". When writing about himself and his personal experiences, Vrba's account is an important and true one, Bauer wrote, but he argued that Vrba was not justified in seeing himself as an expert on Holocaust history. Vrba often dismissed the opinion of historians. Regarding the numbers killed at Auschwitz, he said that Bauer and historian Raul Hilberg did not <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> history of Auschwitz.|$|E
500|$|The lockout {{prompted}} indifference {{among most}} American sports fans, {{who thought that}} greed was shown by both sides; the latter was a similar sentiment to what fans voiced during the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. A CBS News–New York Times poll conducted in October 1998 showed that, while most fans' opinion of professional basketball was unaffected by the work stoppage, 29percent reported that their views had become more negative. The same poll showed that fans backed the NBPA in the dispute by a 36–29 margin, while the general public supported the owners 24percent to 22percent. One-quarter of basketball fans {{who responded to the}} poll stated that they did not <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lockout to give an opinion, along with 45percent of the general public. Media members were frequently critical of the owners and players. Sportswriter Tony Kornheiser described the labor dispute as one [...] "between tall millionaires and short millionaires." [...] An article in Newsweek termed the lockout [...] "an incomprehensible and unconscionable dispute between rival gangs of millionaires". Time Bill Saporito believed that each side was damaged by the lockout, in terms of financial losses and negative publicity. Stern said that he had made concessions in the agreement, while Hunter said that the parties [...] "both blinked." ...|$|E

60|$|To sum up, as chance {{does not}} {{determine}} {{the manner in}} which objects are drawn into the burrows, and as the existence of specialized instincts for each particular case cannot be admitted, the first and most natural supposition is that worms try all methods until they at last succeed; but many appearances are opposed to such a supposition. One alternative alone is left, namely, that worms, although standing low in the scale of organization, possess some degree of intelligence. This will strike every one as very improbable; but it may be doubted whether we <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nervous system of the lower animals to justify our natural distrust of such a conclusion.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Wallace was {{drawn into the}} debate over {{mandatory}} smallpox vaccination. Wallace originally saw the issue {{as a matter of}} personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> human immune system to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.|$|R
40|$|A {{multimedia}} system combines audio, video, graphics, and text into one presentation. Each of these multimedia data types has distinct temporal characteristics. For example video has a specific number of frames {{that must be}} displayed per second. There are also temporal relationships that exist between the media. In a movie application, the audio and video streams must be synchronized to achieve a lip syncing effect. In our system, we manage these temporal requirements through the scheduling of the communication channel; multimedia data is retrieved across the network {{at the appropriate time}} so that temporal presentation requirements are met. This real-time scheduling forms a basis for the limited a priori (LAP) scheduler. The scheduler assumes that it <b>knows</b> <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> system a priori to schedule the next period or limited portion of the presentation.
