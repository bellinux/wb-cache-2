25|$|Swan {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{developers}} of the <b>electric</b> <b>safety</b> <b>lamp</b> for miners, exhibiting his first in Newcastle upon Tyne at the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers on 14 May 1881. This required a wired supply so the following year he presented one with a battery and other improved versions followed. By 1886 a lamp with better light output than a flame safety lamp was in production by the Edison-Swan Company. However, it suffered from problems of reliability and was not a success. It took development by others over the next 20 years or so before effective electric lamps were in common use.|$|E
5000|$|Gustave Trouvé next invented his “Photophore”, or {{battery-powered}} frontal headlamp, {{which he}} developed for a client, Dr Paul Hélot, an ear-nose-and throat specialist of Rouen. This wearable, direct shaft, lighting {{system could be}} oriented by head movements, so freeing the hands of its wearer. A file of correspondence between these two men enables one to place this invention during 1883. Trouvé soon modified their frontal headlamp both for use by miners, rescue workers, and later by speleologists, in dark surroundings, but also by tinting the light with various colors as theater jewelry for artiste troupes in Paris and Europe. The latter became known as “luminous electric jewels” and was the forerunner of today's wearable technology.In 1884, Trouvé fitted an electric boat with both electric horn and a bow-mounted frontal headlamp, the first time such electrical accessories had ever been fitted on any mode of transport. He developed a portable <b>electric</b> <b>safety</b> <b>lamp.</b> [...] In 1887, Trouvé, whose brand name was Eureka (Greek: εὕρηκα =“I have found”, translated into French “J’ai trouvé), developed his auxanoscope, an electric slide projector for itinerant teachers (1887).Around the same period, Trouvé, a confirmed bachelor uninterested in commercialization, turned his fertile mind skywards. Convinced that the future lay with heavier-the-air machines, he flew a tethered model electric helicopter, the ancestor of the Sikorsky Firefly. [...] He next built an ornithopter, the wings of which flapped using a rapid succession gun cartridges, enabling it to make a noisy {{but at the time}} unheard-of flight of 80 meters.|$|E

50|$|The {{owner of}} the mine, Mr. Shafer said that, ``If the mine is reopened, every safety {{precaution}} would be taken of course. Upon {{the recommendation of the}} state mine inspector, nothing but <b>electric</b> <b>safety</b> <b>lamps</b> would be used in the future.`` The mine then reopened on December 28, 1933, after a service was held four days earlier to remember and honor the men who died in the disaster exactly one year before and to commemorate the rescue mine workers who helped uncover the bodies of the men trapped in the mine. The mine started up with success and by March 7, 1934, 65 men were back working in the mine again. In that year, a new company owned by Glen Shafer from Pana, Springfield called the Erie Sootless Coal Company of Moweaqua opened the mine after the summer. It no coal was brought up after March 1935 and the shafts were officially closed in 1936, but were never sold. The mine faced lots of destruction from different people who would vandalize the site. The tipple was mostly torn down by June 1940 and the remaining pieces of the structure blew over due to harsh winds and ruined the engine room five months later. The mine was finally destroyed in October 1941 due to rotting wood in the timbers holding up the mine walls and ceiling and the shaft collapsed on itself creating a sink hole eighty feet wide.|$|R
50|$|As a {{new light}} source, LED has many {{advantages}} for <b>safety</b> <b>lamps,</b> including longer illumination times and reduced energy requirements. Combined with new battery technologies, such as the lithium battery, it gives much better performance in <b>safety</b> <b>lamp</b> applications. It is replacing conventional <b>safety</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>safety</b> <b>lamp</b> is any {{of several}} types of lamp that {{provides}} illumination in coal mines and is designed to operate in air that may contain coal dust or gases {{both of which are}} potentially flammable or explosive. Until the development of effective electric lamps in the early 1900s miners used flame lamps to provide illumination. Open flame lamps could ignite flammable gases which collected in mines, causing explosions and so <b>safety</b> <b>lamps</b> were developed to enclose the flame and prevent it from igniting the surrounding atmosphere. Flame <b>safety</b> <b>lamps</b> have been replaced in mining with sealed explosion-proof electric lights.|$|R

50|$|For airports, {{sometimes}} there are exceptions for height restrictions made for important infrastructure equipment, as radio towers or for structures older than the airport. These structures have to be marked with red and white paint, have flight <b>safety</b> <b>lamps</b> on top, or both. Often red and white paint and flight <b>safety</b> <b>lamps</b> have to be installed on high structures (taller than 100 m) far away from airports. Height restriction laws are not always kept strictly.|$|R
5000|$|Firedamp {{detection}} was {{by means}} of a flame <b>safety</b> <b>lamp.</b> Flame <b>safety</b> <b>lamps</b> need to be monitored to be effective, and in consequence the regulations [...] require certain men to have lamps with them. The men are not permitted to also have electric lamps with them, to ensure that they are aware of changes in the flame. However written permission from the mine manager may be obtained to allow electric lamps, and this was routinely given. Since the lamps were not needed for illumination, they become just an additional burden to carry and were sometimes left behind. When the explosion occurred both <b>safety</b> <b>lamps</b> had been left behind at the intake and so were not at the face. Roberts is unsure whether the lamps would have detected the firedamp in time.|$|R

50|$|In active mining operations, {{the threat}} from blackdamp is {{addressed}} with proper mineshaft ventilation as well as various detection methods, typically using miner's <b>safety</b> <b>lamps</b> or hand-held electronic gas detectors. The <b>safety</b> <b>lamp</b> is merely a specially designed lantern with a flame {{that is designed to}} automatically extinguish itself at an oxygen concentration of approximately 18% (normal atmospheric concentration of oxygen is ~21%). This low detection threshold gives miners an unmistakable warning and allows them to escape before any potentially incapacitating effects are felt.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{influence}} of distance, time and color for <b>safety</b> <b>lamp</b> filter variation to radiograph has been done. The research uses blue sensitive film and green sensitive, type -X ray, film. The {{research was conducted}} by illuminating film with <b>safety</b> <b>lamp</b> red, yellow, green and blue color filter. The type of filter is red acrylic riddle and glass which is layered in red, yellow, green and blue scot light. The variation of irradiating distance between <b>safety</b> <b>lamp</b> with film is 20 cm, 30 cm, 40 cm, 50 cm, 60 cm, 70 cm, 80 cm, 90 cm, 100 cm and variation of time is 10 second, 15 second, 20 second, 25 second, 30 second, 35 second, 40 second, 45 second, 50 second, 55 second, 60 second. Measurement of irradiating result uses measuring densitometer instrument. The result of research gives an illustration that variation of distance, variation of time and color of <b>safety</b> <b>lamp</b> filter influence the radiograph. The greater distance causes the fog result becomes smaller. The longer time causes the fog result becomes bigger. To red acrylic filter, the fog that resulted exceed the tolerance limit is more than 0, 2, but for glass filter that layered red scot light is not more than tolerance limit...|$|R

25|$|Fletcher hired C. A. Russell, Solicitor and Henn Collins QC (later Baron Collins) {{to appeal}} this {{decision}} to the Divisional Court at Wigan. The reasoning behind the appeal was twofold, first; that the umpire {{was limited to}} deeming whether an open light was dangerous and not determining that mines need to be worked with a particular remedy as this went beyond his powers and second; that instead of using <b>safety</b> <b>lamps,</b> the owners could {{get rid of the}} firedamp, thus not requiring <b>safety</b> <b>lamps</b> as laid down in the notice.|$|R
50|$|Stephenson {{designed}} a <b>safety</b> <b>lamp,</b> {{known as the}} Geordie lamp, with air fed through narrow tubes, down which a flame could not move. It also led Sir Humphry Davy to devise another <b>safety</b> <b>lamp,</b> the Davy lamp, in which the flame was surrounded by iron gauze. The gauze had to have small spaces so that a flame could not pass through, but could admit methane, which then burned harmlessly inside the lamp. The height of the luminous cone above the flame gave {{a measure of the}} methane concentration in the atmosphere.|$|R

25|$|After hatting, {{the most}} {{important}} industry in Denton was the manufacture of lead-acid batteries by Oldham Batteries (Oldham & Son Ltd). In 1865, Joseph Oldham established a millwright general engineering shop and by 1887 this company was manufacturing machinery for the hat-making industry. Another important industry in the area was coal mining and shortly after 1887 the company began making machinery and equipment for this industry, which included miners' portable lamps. Up to this time, miners had always used the <b>safety</b> <b>lamp</b> devised in 1815 by Sir Humphry Davy (1778–1829) but this new battery-powered Davy lamp eventually replaced the traditional <b>safety</b> <b>lamp.</b>|$|R
50|$|After the {{widespread}} {{introduction of the}} <b>safety</b> <b>lamp,</b> explosions continued because the early lamps were fragile and easily damaged. For example, the iron gauze on a Davy lamp only needed to lose one wire to become unsafe. The light was also very poor (compared to a naked flame) and there were continuous attempts to improve the basic design. The height of the cone of burning methane in a flame <b>safety</b> <b>lamp</b> {{can be used to}} estimate the concentration of the gas in the local atmosphere. It was not until the 1890s that safe and reliable electric lamps became available in collieries.|$|R
