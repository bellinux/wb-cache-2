5|$|Triton was {{discovered}} by William Lassell in 1846, just seventeen days after the discovery of Neptune. Nereid {{was discovered}} by Gerard P. Kuiper in 1949. The third moon, later named Larissa, was first observed by Harold J. Reitsema, William B. Hubbard, Larry A. Lebofsky and David J. Tholen on May 24, 1981. The astronomers were observing a star's close approach to Neptune, looking for rings similar to those discovered around Uranus four years earlier. If rings were present, the star's luminosity would decrease slightly just before the planet's closest approach. The star's luminosity dipped only <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>seconds,</b> which meant that {{it was due to}} a moon rather than a ring.|$|E
5|$|Hunters {{primarily}} {{attack the}} player by bracing themselves and firing bursts from their flechette cannon. Four flechettes can vaporize an ordinary human soldier. If {{they do not}} strike a living target, the flechette charge up <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>seconds</b> and then explode, dealing minor damage to everything nearby. Hunters may also conduct a charging attack or strike with their legs if the player gets too close. Hunters are vulnerable to all weapons, but to compensate, are still quite resilient, making explosives and the pulse rifle's charged energy ball the most attractive options. Objects thrown with the gravity gun are also effective, especially if the player catches some of their flechettes with the object before hurling it (one of the in-game Achievements). In outdoor environments, they can be run over with a vehicle.|$|E

5|$|The episode filmed {{for eight}} days. In one sequence, Carl Grimes sparks up a {{cigarette}} lighter and drops {{it onto a}} horde of walkers after Rick creates a diversion to distract the walkers. Greg Nicotero, the special effect director for The Walking Dead, used black panels to capture {{the elements of the}} fire; this enabled them to edit the flames onto the walkers. To reduce the chances of getting burned, the stuntmen put on several layers of flame retardant suits. The first layer consisted of a dry Nomex undergarment; this was followed by several layers of Nomex clothing that were gelled. Since the sequence was conducted on multiple occasions, the stuntmen were coated with gel containing cationic polymers. The last layer was a raincoat, which would separate the gel from the stuntmen's clothing and allowed them to be engulfed in flames <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>seconds</b> without injury.|$|E
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} manifests as {{symptoms such as}} visual changes (especially tunnel vision), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, twitching (especially of the face), behavioural changes (irritability, anxiety, confusion), and dizziness. This may {{be followed by a}} tonic–clonic seizure consisting of two phases: intense muscle contraction occurs <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>seconds</b> (tonic phase); followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking (clonic phase). The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness (the postictal state). The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration. However, exposure time before onset is unpredictable, as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, and in the same individual from day to day. In addition, many external factors, such as underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms. Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide. Other factors, such as darkness and caffeine, increase tolerance in test animals, but these effects have not been proven in humans.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a simple but}} surprisingly effective technique of obtaining spectral multiplier results for abstract operators which satisfy the finite propagation speed property for the corresponding wave equation propagator. We show that, in this setting, spectral multipliers follow from resolvent type estimates. The most notable point of the paper is that our approach is very flexible and can be applied even if the corresponding ambient space does not satisfy the doubling condition or if the semigroup generated by an operator is not uniformly bounded. As a corollary we obtain the L^p spectrum independence <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>second</b> order differential operators and recover some known results. Our examples include the Laplace-Belltrami operator on manifolds with ends and Schrödinger operators with strongly subcritical potentials. Comment: 15 page...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} abstract non-negative self-adjoint operators on L 2 (X) which {{satisfy the}} finite speed propagation property for the corresponding wave equation. For such operators we introduce a restriction type condition {{which in the}} case of the standard Laplace operator is equivalent to (p; 2) restriction estimate of Stein and Tomas. Next we show that in the considered abstract setting our restriction type condition implies sharp spectral multipliers and endpoint estimates for the Bochner- Riesz summability. We also observe that this restriction estimate holds for operators satisfying dispersive or Strichartz estimates. We obtain new spectral multiplier results <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>second</b> order di erential operators and recover some known results. Our examples include Schr¨odinger operators with inverse square potentials on Rn, the harmonic oscillator, elliptic operators on compact manifolds and Schr¨odinger operators on asymptotically conic manifolds...|$|R

25|$|In {{contemporary}} psychiatric practice, ECT is used {{mainly in}} the treatment of depression. It is occasionally used {{in the treatment of}} other disorders such as schizophrenia. When undergoing modern ECT, a patient is given an anaesthetic and a muscle relaxant. A brief-pulse electric current of about 800 milliamperes is passed between two electrodes on the head <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>seconds,</b> causing a seizure. The resulting convulsion is modified by the muscle relaxant. ECT is usually given on an inpatient basis; about one in five treatments are given on an outpatient basis. Treatment is usually given twice a week (occasionally three times a week) for a total of 6–12 treatments, although courses may be longer or shorter. About 70 per cent of ECT patients are women. About 1,500 ECT patients a year in the UK are treated without their consent under the Mental Health Acts or the provisions of common law.|$|E

25|$|May 21, 1988: An American Airlines McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, {{registration}} number N136AA, operating as AA Flight 70 bound for Frankfurt, overran runway 35L after automatic warning signals prompted {{the flight crew}} to attempt a rejected takeoff; the jetliner continued to accelerate <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>seconds</b> before slowing, and did not stop until it had run 1,100 feet (335 m) past the runway threshold, collapsing the nose landing gear. 2 crew were seriously injured and the remaining 12 crew and 240 passengers escaped safely; the aircraft was severely damaged and was written off.

40|$|Heat pulse {{propagation}} {{has been studied}} in p-type silicon and p-type germanium {{as a function of}} uniaxial stress (up to 109 dynes cm- 2), and of pulse temperature. The important phonon scattering rates due to stress-split acceptor states were derived. The rates were obtained for resonance absorption (for phonons with energies close to the splitting energy), and <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>second</b> order processes. In addition, Rayleigh scattering of phonons by isotopic impurities has been evaluated. The total, calculated scattering rate agrees well with the observed stress dependence of the heat pulse amplitudes. A fit of the experimental results to the calculated ones yields two distinct sets of values for the « static » (a* q >≈ 1) and « dynamic » (a* q << 1) deformation potential constants (a* is the effective Bohr radius of the impurity; q is the wave number of the relevant wave component). This observation resolves the apparent conflict in previously reported values of these constants, obtained from separate studies in the static (e. g., piezoreflectance) and dynamic (thermal conductivity) regimes. It should be emphasized that the heat pulse study is particularly well suited for investigating these differences, because the constants for the two regimes are derived {{within the framework of the}} same experiment...|$|R
