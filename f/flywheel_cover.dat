5000|$|The bike's [...] single-cylinder powerplant, {{redesigned}} for the 1958 125 Aurea, was {{an overhead}} valve pushrod engine made visually distinctive by a [...] "Ducati Meccanica" [...] winged laurel wreath and [...] "D" [...] logo cast in relief in brass {{on the left}} side aluminum <b>flywheel</b> <b>cover.</b> Mechanically, the new engine used an internal rather than external oil line feeding the upper valve train. The Aurea was styled like previous sporty standard models (Ducati 125 TV, 125 T), but had a 6V battery added to help the flywheel magneto power the lights and horn. For the 1960 Bronco, the Aurea's low, racing-style handlebar was replaced with a more upright touring handlebar, and a smaller gas tank, and smaller 16-inch, knobby tires were fitted.|$|E

50|$|In 1998, {{the engine}} {{supplier}} changed to Vauxhall, with 1600 {{single overhead cam}} engines being used. They featured a ported & skimmed cylinder head, standard Vauxhall camshaft, <b>flywheel</b> and clutch <b>cover</b> plate, two Weber twin choke 40 DCOE 151 (sidedraft) carburettors, main jets size 115, with K&N performance filters. The maximum power was 101 ps at 5,500 rpm and a max torque of 107 lb ft at 3,600 rpm. The main visual difference between the Fords and the Vauxhalls was that the Vauxhalls had a side-exit exhaust, {{as opposed to the}} rear exit of the Fords.|$|R
50|$|The RAF 1 {{was based}} on the Renault 70/80 hp engine, being {{intended}} specifically to replace that engine in the B.E.2c. It featured larger cylinders (3.94 x 5.5 in) for a total displacement of 540 cubic inches (8.8 L). It was rated at 92 hp (70 kW) at 1,600 rpm. The heads were cast integrally with the cylinders, with the intake and exhaust valves set one above the other in an upside-down F-head configuration. The engines featured a large diameter lightweight flywheel at the rear, enclosed in a cast housing. Engine oil was picked up {{from the bottom of the}} crankcase and slung into a reservoir at the top. From there it was gravity fed, via a gallery high on the right side of the engine block, to the main bearing caps, and then to the connecting rod journals by centrifugal effect of the turning crankshaft. The main bearings were ball bearings and were splash fed. Engine oil from the gallery was also supplied to the 1 : 2 reduction gearbox at the front. This drove the four-bladed propeller at one half engine speed, and the single camshaft was splined into the rear of the short propeller shaft. This arrangement meant that no mechanical oil pump was needed.Excess engine oil from the flywheel overflowed the reservoir and trickled over the large surface area of the round <b>flywheel</b> <b>cover.</b> Two passages cast into the cover took air-fuel mixture from the carburettor mounted at the bottom to a copper U-shaped inlet manifold mounted between the banks of cylinders, and the <b>flywheel</b> <b>cover</b> acted as a heat exchanger, preheating the fuel-air. In late 1915, the bore was increased to 4.1 in, leading to an increased displacement of 590 cubic inches (9.7 L) and power of 86 kW (115 hp) at 1,800 rpm.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the noise source identification (NSI) in a diesel engine at different engine speeds. An experiment was conducted utilizing an eddy current dynamometer with a sound intensity mapping method for the engine speed range of 1500 rpm to 2000 rpm. The noise source of the <b>flywheel</b> <b>cover</b> and manifold are presented. It can be observed that the critical cut-off frequency is 1250 Hz. The sound level powers are within the range of 86. 42 dB to 96. 34 dB in varying engine speeds. Further, the noise level is found to be increasing with engine speed. Another main source of vibration is engine mounting, which has a significant effect on noise level due to the engine’s structural vibration transfer and noise radiation behavior with respect to the excitation mechanism. The noise power level for mounting is within the range of 77. 17 dB to 89. 96 dB for an engine speed of 1500 rpm to 2000 rpm. This method can be applied on-site rather than in an anechoic chamber as long as the background noises are stationary. The project delivers a reliable input for the engineering practice to reduce engine noise level. ...|$|E
40|$|This project {{presents}} the effort taken {{to determine the}} major source of the noise and verify the frequency resonance and amplitudes for different engine speed of the engine dynamometer in automotive research laboratory of Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP). The research describes the experimental set-up and investigation of the mechanisms of engine dynamometer noise generation and the corresponding countermeasures employed during the engine performance tested. According to the analysis of acoustic signals and vibration signals measurement, an investigation of the noise source identification in a diesel engine is presented, and that the noise level of the diesel is comprehended. The experiment carried out with several altered parameters for flexibility investigation. With the sound intensity method, the results of the noise source of <b>flywheel</b> <b>cover</b> and exhaust were presented. The results of analysis showed that the 1250 Hz bands had the most significant contribution to the engine right noise. For the 1500 rpm, 2000 rpm and 2500 rpm the sound power level are 86. 42 dB, 92. 44 and 96. 34 dB respectively. These clearly show that higher rpm will increase the noise at the engine. Additionally mounting area noise for this engine also give significant effect with the value of 77. 71 dB for 1500 rpm and 89. 86 db for 2500 rpm due to the engine’s structural vibration transfer and noise radiation behavior with respect to the excitation mechanism. The research also provides the reliable basis for the engineering practice to reduce noise level...|$|E
5000|$|When the tensile {{strength}} of a composite <b>flywheel's</b> outer binding <b>cover</b> is exceeded, the binding cover will fracture, followed by the wheel shattering as the outer wheel compression is lost around the entire circumference, releasing all of its stored energy at once; this is {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "flywheel explosion" [...] since wheel fragments can reach kinetic energy comparable to that of a bullet. Composite materials that are wound and glued in layers tend to disintegrate quickly, first into small-diameter filaments that entangle and slow each other, and then into red-hot powder, instead of large chunks of high-velocity shrapnel as can occur with a cast metal flywheel.|$|R
40|$|The {{secure and}} {{economic}} {{operation of the}} future power system is facing major challenges. These challenges are driven by the increase of the penetration of converter connected and distributed renewable generation and electrified demand. In this thesis, a new smart energy management paradigm, i. e. a Virtual Energy Storage System (VESS), to address these challenges was studied. A VESS aggregates energy storage and flexible demand units into a single entity which performs similarly to a large-capacity conventional energy storage system. A VESS mitigates {{the uncertainty of the}} response from flexible demand through coordination with a minimum capacity of costly energy storage systems. Mathematical models of four components of a VESS were developed. Specifically, models of two types of energy storage, i. e. flywheel energy storage and battery energy storage, were developed. Thermodynamic models of two types of flexible demand units, i. e. domestic refrigerators and industrial bitumen tanks, were developed. These models were validated against the performance of similar equipment from the literature. Aggregated models, representing a population of units, for each of flywheels, batteries, refrigerators and bitumen tanks were developed. These aggregated models represent a randomly diversified population of units. These aggregated models were used to establish the frequency and the voltage control schemes of a VESS. A frequency control scheme of the VESS was designed. The control scheme provides low, high and continuous frequency response services to the system operator. The centralised control scheme coordinates models of refrigerators and units of the flywheel energy storage system. Following frequency deviations, the local frequency controllers of refrigerators changed their power consumption. The local frequency controllers of the <b>flywheel</b> units <b>cover</b> the power mismatch between the change in refrigerators power consumption and the required response from the VESS. The required response from the VESS is determined by a droop control. Case studies were conducted to evaluate the frequency control scheme by connecting the VESS to a simplified GB power system. Results showed that the response from the frequency control scheme of the VESS was similar to that of only flywheel energy storage. Based on an economic evaluation, the VESS is estimated to obtain approximately 50...|$|R
