5|$|The food most {{associated}} with Purim is called ozne haman ("Haman's ears"). These are three-cornered pastries filled most often with poppy seed, but also other fruit <b>fillings.</b> The triangular shape {{may have been}} influenced by old illustrations of Haman, in which he wore a three-cornered hat.|$|E
5|$|A part-savoury, part-sweet pasty (similar to the Bedfordshire clanger) was {{eaten by}} miners in the 19th century, in the copper mines on Parys Mountain, Anglesey. The {{technician}} {{who did the}} research and discovered the recipe claimed that the recipe was probably taken to Anglesey by Cornish miners travelling to the area looking for work. No two-course pasties are commercially produced in Cornwall today, but are usually the product of amateur cooks. They are, however, commercially available in the British supermarket chain Morrisons (under the name 'Tin Miner Pasty'). Other traditional <b>fillings</b> have included {{a wide variety of}} locally available meats including pork, bacon, egg, rabbit, chicken, mackerel and sweet <b>fillings</b> such as dates, apples, jam and sweetened rice - leading to the oft-quoted joke that 'the Devil hisself was afeared to cross over into Cornwall for fear that ee'd end up in a pasty'.|$|E
5|$|Robert May's The Accomplisht Cook was {{published}} in 1660 when he was 72 years old. The book included {{a substantial number of}} recipes for soups and stews, 38 recipes for sturgeon, and a large number of pies variously containing fish (including sturgeon), meat (including battalia pie), and sweet <b>fillings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since 1955, Molde {{had been}} playing their home games at Molde idrettspark (at the time called Molde stadion), a municipal-owned multi-use venue. A new stadium was {{proposed}} to be located at the waterfront at Reknes. There were many local protests, including complaints {{about the size of}} the structure. Construction of the land <b>fillings</b> and preparation of the construction site started in March 1997, before final approval had been granted by the municipality.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} {{is difficult to}} treat, and may involve <b>fillings,</b> fluoride to fight tooth decay and drugs that increase saliva for dry mouth, as well as oral hygiene instruction. It can be medically dangerous for active methamphetamine users because of the cardiac problems that can result from the interaction of local anesthetic with the drug.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Texas culture {{comes from}} a blend of Southern (Dixie), Western (frontier), and Southwestern (Mexican/Anglo fusion) influences, varying in degrees of such from one intrastate region to another. Texas {{is placed in the}} Southern United States by the United States Census Bureau. A popular food item, the breakfast burrito, draws from all three, having a soft flour tortilla wrapped around bacon and {{scrambled}} eggs or other hot, cooked <b>fillings.</b> Adding to Texas's traditional culture, established in the 18th and 19th centuries, immigration has made Texas a melting pot of cultures from around the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic concept}} of Gibanica, a cake or pie {{involving}} {{a combination of}} pastry with cheese in differentiated layers often combined with layers of various other <b>fillings,</b> is common in the cuisines of the Balkans, Anatolia, and the Eastern Mediterranean. For example, a similar dish known as Shabiyat (Sh'abiyat, Shaabiyat) {{is part of the}} cuisine of Syria and Lebanon. Gibanica can also be considered to resemble a type of cheese strudel, with which it likely shares a common ancestry in the pastry dishes of the region, and the cuisines of the Byzantine and Ottoman empires.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} Cornish pasty, which since 2011 has Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) {{status in}} Europe, {{is filled with}} beef, sliced or diced potato, swede (also known as yellow turnip or rutabaga – referred to in Cornwall as turnip) and onion, seasoned with salt and pepper, and is baked. Today, the pasty is the food most associated with Cornwall. It {{is regarded as the}} national dish and accounts for 6% of the Cornish food economy. Pasties with many different <b>fillings</b> are made and some shops specialise in selling all sorts of pasties.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Maria began wrestling and was {{defeated}} in her first official match on the January 10, 2005 episode of Raw by Christy Hemme in a Lingerie Pillow Fight. On the March 14 episode of Raw, one of Maria's <b>fillings</b> legitimately fell out after she was slapped by Trish Stratus. She also competed in a Fulfill Your Fantasy Diva Battle Royal at Taboo Tuesday for the WWE Women's Championship, but {{was the first to}} be eliminated. On November 14, Maria competed in a non-title Diva Battle Royal at the Eddie Guerrero tribute Raw show, where {{she was one of the}} last three women left but was eliminated by Melina and Trish Stratus.|$|E
5|$|Non-dental {{sources of}} pain often cause {{multiple}} teeth to hurt {{and have an}} epicenter that is either above or below the jaws. For instance, cardiac pain (which can make the bottom teeth hurt) usually radiates up from the chest and neck, and sinusitis (which can make the back top teeth hurt) is worsened by bending over. As all of these conditions may mimic toothache, {{it is possible that}} dental treatment, such as <b>fillings,</b> root canal treatment, or tooth extraction may be carried out unnecessarily by dentists in an attempt to relieve the individual's pain, and as a result the correct diagnosis is delayed. A hallmark {{is that there is no}} obvious dental cause, and signs and symptoms elsewhere in the body may be present. As migraines are typically present for many years, the diagnosis is easier to make. Often the character of the pain is the differentiator between dental and non-dental pain.|$|E
5|$|The SS owned {{experimental}} farms, bakeries, meat packing plants, leather works, {{clothing and}} uniform factories, and small arms factories. Under {{the direction of}} the WVHA, the SS sold camp labor to various factories at a rate of three to six Reichsmarks per prisoner per day. The SS confiscated and sold the property of concentration camp inmates, confiscated their investment portfolios and their cash, and profited from their dead bodies by selling their hair to make felt and melting down their dental work to obtain gold from the <b>fillings.</b> The total value of assets looted from the victims of Operation Reinhard alone (not including Auschwitz) was listed by Odilo Globocnik as 178,745,960.59 Reichsmarks. Items seized included 2,909.68 kilograms of gold worth 843,802.75 RM, as well as 18,733.69kg of silver, 1,514kg of platinum, 249,771.50 American dollars, 130 diamond solitaires, 2,511.87 carats of brilliants, 13,458.62 carats of diamonds, and 114kg of pearls. According to Nazi legislation, Jewish property belonged to the state, but many SS camp commandants and guards stole items such as diamonds or currency for personal gain, or took seized foodstuffs and liquor to sell on the black market.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s and 1990s in Norway, {{there was}} {{considerable}} and intense public debate {{on the use of}} dental amalgam. The Norwegian Dental Patients Association (Forbundet Tenner og Helse), made up of people who believe they suffered health effects from amalgam <b>fillings,</b> was a driving force in this debate. During this time, the media often featured interviews with people claiming that their health problems were caused by amalgam <b>fillings,</b> and who have regained their health after replacing their amalgam <b>fillings</b> with a different material. Some scientific studies also reported that patients have been restored to health after having had their amalgam <b>fillings</b> replaced. However, these studies were heavily disputed at the time and the Norwegian Board of Health still maintain there is no scientifically proven connection between dental amalgam and health problems.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s a {{specific}} form of surgery known as psychic dentistry emerged in America. Willard Fuller {{was the most}} well known proponent. It was alleged that Fuller could cause dental <b>fillings</b> to appear spontaneously, change silver into golden <b>fillings,</b> straighten crooked teeth or produce new teeth. However, magicians and skeptics have found these claims to be unsupported by solid evidence. One dentist examined some patients of Fuller. In one case miraculous gold <b>fillings</b> {{turned out to be}} tobacco stains. In another case a female patient who reported a miraculous new silver filling admitted she had forgotten that the filling was already there.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{research}} regarding {{the safety of}} amalgam <b>fillings,</b> the state of California requires warning information given to patients for legal reasons (informed consent) as part of California's controversial and voter-driven Proposition 65. This warning also applied to resin <b>fillings</b> for a time, since they contain Bis-phenol A (BPA) a chemical known to cause reproductive toxicity at high doses.|$|E
25|$|The American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology {{say that}} {{research}} confirms that mercury from amalgams {{does not cause}} illness because the amount of mercury that they release {{is not enough to}} cause a health problem. In response to some people wanting their existing amalgam removed for fear of mercury poisoning, these societies advise that the removal of <b>fillings</b> is likely to cause a greater exposure to mercury than leaving the <b>fillings</b> in place. These societies warn that removal of amalgam <b>fillings,</b> in addition to being unnecessary health care and likely to cause more mercury exposure than leaving them in place, is also expensive.|$|E

25|$|Both {{those opposed}} and those {{not opposed to}} dental amalgam {{recognize}} that amalgam {{has been found to}} be a rare contributor to localized and temporary tissue irritation known as oral lichenoid lesions. These mild, lichenoid reactions have also been reported in composite resin <b>fillings.</b> Those opposed to amalgam believe that amalgam <b>fillings</b> are also associated with increased risk of other autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis, lupus, thyroiditis, and eczema.|$|E

25|$|Jianbing from Shandong {{province}} tastes crispy {{and harder}} as its batter is formed from {{the flour mixture}} that mainly contains coarse grains such as corn, sorghum and millet. In the old days, people had Shandong-style jianbing mainly by rolling it with scallions or serving it with meat soup. Nowadays, the variety of <b>fillings</b> are richer and differ according to one’s preference, for example, sweet potatoes, lettuce and pork are also used as <b>fillings.</b>|$|E
25|$|Those {{opposed to}} amalgam use suggest that modern {{composites}} are improving in strength. In {{addition to their}} claims of possible health and ethical issues, opponents of dental amalgam <b>fillings</b> claim amalgam <b>fillings</b> contribute to mercury contamination of the environment. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that health care facilities, including dental offices, account {{for as much as}} 5% of total waste water mercury emissions. The WHO also points out that amalgam separators, installed in the waste water lines of many dental offices, dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the public sewer system. However, critics say that the separators are not mandatory in some states of the United States. The critics also point to cremation of dental <b>fillings</b> as an additional source of air pollution, contributing about 1% of total global emissions.|$|E
25|$|Better {{dental health}} overall coupled with {{increased}} demand for more modern alternatives such as resin composite <b>fillings</b> (which match the tooth color), as well as public concern about the mercury content of dental amalgam, {{have resulted in a}} steady decline in dental amalgam use in developed countries, though overall amalgam use continues to rise worldwide. Given its superior strength, durability, and long life relative to the more expensive composite <b>fillings,</b> it will likely be used for many years to come. Over a lifetime, dietary sources of mercury are far higher than would ever be received from the presence of amalgam <b>fillings</b> in the mouth. For example, due to pollution of the world's oceans with heavy metals, products such as cod liver oil may contain significant levels of mercury.|$|E
25|$|The Francesinha Especial (Special Francesinha) is a Francesinha {{with egg}} and/or potato chips. Other {{variations}} of the original include <b>fillings</b> such as pork, chicken, tuna, codfish.|$|E
25|$|According to one dental textbook, eating seafood {{once a week}} raises urine mercury {{levels to}} 5 to 20µg/L, which is {{equivalent}} to two to eight times the level of exposure that comes from numerous amalgam <b>fillings.</b> Neither exposure has any known health effect. Scientists agree that dental amalgam <b>fillings</b> release elemental mercury vapor, but studies report different amounts, {{which may or may}} not be sufficient to pose a significant risk to health. Estimates range from 1-3 micrograms (µg) per day according to the FDA. The effects of that amount of exposure are also disputed.|$|E
25|$|Neapolitan Oreo cookies were {{a limited}} edition release in 2012, {{made up of}} three golden Oreo cookies with a double {{sandwich}} of chocolate and strawberry creme <b>fillings.</b>|$|E

These dishes include pozole de trigo, pozole de res, menudo con pata, verdolagas (Portulaca oleracea) broth, sopa de elote, caldo de calabazas and sopa de camarón. Tamales are made with cornmeal dough and <b>fillings</b> such as beans, vegetables, potatoes, chile colorado and other ingredients, wrapped in dried corn husks and steamed. Tamale <b>fillings</b> vary in the state but the most popular include fresh corn with cream, green chile strips with cheese, beef with chile colorado and seafood.|$|E
