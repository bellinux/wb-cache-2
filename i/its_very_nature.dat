5|$|When {{appealing}} {{for military}} {{aid from the}} American Government {{in the aftermath of}} the Whitman massacre, the settlers detailed the structural weaknesses of the Provisional Government: The very nature of our compact formed between the citizens of a republic and the subjects and official representatives of a monarchy, is such that the ties of political union could not be drawn so closely as to produce that stability and strength sufficient to form an efficient government. This union between democrats of a republic and wealthy aristocratic subjects of a monarchy could not be formed without reserving to themselves the right of allegiance to their respective governments. Political jealousy and strong party feeling have tended to thwart and render impotent the acts of a government, from <b>its</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> weak and insufficient.|$|E

25|$|The slum-dwellers in {{informal}} economies run many risks. The informal sector, by <b>its</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature,</b> means income {{insecurity and}} lack of social mobility. There is also absence of legal contracts, protection of labor rights, regulations and bargaining power in informal employments.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{audio input}} (DAI) allows {{the hearing aid}} to be {{directly}} connected to an external audio source like a CD player or an assistive listening device (ALD). By <b>its</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature,</b> DAI is susceptible to far less electromagnetic interference, and yields a better quality audio signal as opposed to using a T-coil with standard headphones. An audio boot {{is a type of}} device that may be used to facilitate DAI.|$|E
25|$|Psychiatric {{research}} is, by <b>its</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature,</b> interdisciplinary; combining social, {{biological and}} psychological perspectives {{in attempt to}} understand the nature and treatment of mental disorders. Clinical and research psychiatrists study basic and clinical psychiatric topics at research institutions and publish articles in journals. Under the supervision of institutional review boards, psychiatric clinical researchers look at topics such as neuroimaging, genetics, and psychopharmacology in order to enhance diagnostic validity and reliability, to discover new treatment methods, and to classify new mental disorders.|$|E
50|$|Battles BC is a 2009 {{documentary}} series looking at key battles in ancient history. The show {{was known for}} <b>its</b> <b>very</b> gritty <b>nature,</b> visual effects similar to the film 300 and its highly choreographed fight scenes with various weapons.|$|R
50|$|Given <b>its</b> <b>very</b> unusual <b>nature,</b> for Penderecki's {{chamber music}} is rare, the melodic lines of this {{composition}} {{are very well}} defined, because Penderecki usually writes scores for large orchestras and ensembles. This work is remarkable for its chromatic scales, present all along the piece.|$|R
50|$|The monjon was {{described}} in 1978, having long eluded discovery. This is largely because of <b>its</b> <b>very</b> timid <b>nature,</b> <b>its</b> small size of a length between 300 mm and 350 mm and average weight of 1.3 kg and its limited distribution. It is still very little-known.|$|R
25|$|Most of {{the ethnic}} {{minority}} people work their land on sloping terraces since {{the vast majority of}} the land is mountainous. Their staple foods are rice and corn. Rice, by <b>its</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> of being a labour-intensive crop, makes the daily fight for survival paramount. The unique climate in Sa Pa has a major influence on the ethnic minorities who live in the area. With sub-tropical summers, temperate winters and 160 days of mist annually, the influence on agricultural yields and health-related issues is significant.|$|E
25|$|Interactions between {{groundwater}} {{and surface}} water are complex. Consequently, groundwater pollution, {{sometimes referred to}} as groundwater contamination, is not as easily classified as surface water pollution. By <b>its</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature,</b> groundwater aquifers are susceptible to contamination from sources that may not directly affect surface water bodies, and the distinction of point vs. non-point source may be irrelevant. A spill or ongoing release of chemical or radionuclide contaminants into soil (located away from a surface water body) may not create point or non-point source pollution but can contaminate the aquifer below, creating a toxic plume.|$|E
25|$|The term post-anarchism was {{originated}} by Saul Newman, {{and first}} received popular attention {{in his book}} From Bakunin to Lacan {{to refer to a}} theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken {{on a life of its}} own and a wide range of ideas including post-modernism, autonomism, post-left anarchy, situationism, post-colonialism and Zapatismo. By <b>its</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or should not be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include Saul Newman, Todd May, Lewis Call, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari and Michel Onfray.|$|E

50|$|This film {{stirred up}} a storm upon release for its {{depiction}} of a Caesarian birth. Though not much was really shown, {{it was enough to}} cause women filmgoers—and not a few men—to faint. The film was banned outright in Germany and ran into some censorship problems in the US; still, by <b>its</b> <b>very</b> controversial <b>nature</b> it proved to be a hit wherever it was shown.|$|R
50|$|The introduction's {{theme is}} notable for its {{apparent}} formal {{independence from the}} rest of the movement and from the concerto as a whole, especially given its setting not in the work’s nominal key of B-flat minor but rather in D-flat major, that key's relative major. Despite <b>its</b> <b>very</b> substantial <b>nature,</b> this theme is only heard twice, and it never reappears at any later point in the concerto.|$|R
25|$|Interactions between {{groundwater}} {{and surface}} water are complex.

By <b>its</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature,</b> groundwater aquifers are susceptible to contamination from sources that may not directly affect surface water bodies, and the distinction of point vs. non-point source may be irrelevant. A spill or ongoing release of chemical or radionuclide contaminants into soil (located away from a surface water body) may not create point or non-point source pollution but can contaminate the aquifer below, creating a toxic plume. The movement of the plume, called a plume front, may be analyzed through a hydrological transport model or groundwater model. Analysis of groundwater contamination may focus on soil characteristics and site geology, hydrogeology, hydrology, {{and the nature of the}} contaminants.|$|E
25|$|From {{around the}} year 500 BC, the {{dictatorship}} was the main measure of emergency power in the Roman Republic. In a senatus consultum, the Roman Senate would authorize the consuls to nominate a dictator who received imperium magnum, great power {{to act in a}} time of emergency (usually military) until the crisis was over (but no longer than half a year). The dictatorship marked the sole exception from the rules of collegiality and responsibility, meaning the dictator was not legally liable for official actions. This changed {{around the year}} 300 BC, when, against <b>its</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature,</b> the dictatorship was placed under the public provocatio, meaning that the Plebeian Council could be called to counter-act executive actions of the dictator. As a result, the practice was altered and later dropped altogether after 202 BC.|$|E

50|$|Due to <b>its</b> <b>very</b> rural <b>nature,</b> the {{principal}} economica {{activity of the}} municipality is agriculture followed by livestock. There are more than 3,400 farms and other fields devoted to crops covering more than 70% of the municipality's territory. There are also 24 ejidos (cooperative farms) located here. Principal crops include corn, beans, chili peppers, squash, tomatoes, onions, melons, mango and papaya. Most of the livestock raised here are pigs and cattle.|$|R

500|$|Prince Ghica also {{attempted}} {{to improve the}} peasant situation by outlawing quit-rents and regulating that peasants {{could no longer be}} removed from the land they were working on. This measure produced little lasting effects; according to Kogălniceanu, [...] "the cause [...] should be sought in the all-mightiness of landowners, in the weakness of the government, who, through <b>its</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature,</b> was provisional, and thus powerless".|$|E
500|$|In 1987, Dworkin {{published}} Intercourse, {{in which}} she extended her analysis from pornography to sexual intercourse itself, and argued that the sort of sexual subordination depicted in pornography was central to men's and women's experiences of heterosexual intercourse in a male supremacist society. In the book, she argues that all heterosexual sex in our patriarchal society is coercive and degrading to women, and sexual penetration may by <b>its</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> doom women to inferiority and submission, and [...] "may be immune to reform".|$|E
500|$|Following the Performance 2007 Tour {{in support}} of the band's {{previous}} album Year Zero (2007), Reznor set out to make a record [...] "with very little forethought". Ghosts I–IV originated from an experiment: [...] "The rules were as follows: 10 weeks, no clear agenda, no overthinking, everything driven by impulse. Whatever happens during that time gets released as... something." [...] Reznor explained, [...] "I've been considering and wanting to make this kind of record for years, but by <b>its</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> it wouldn't have made sense until this point".|$|E

What's more, the criminality of the object in plain view must be obvious by <b>its</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature.</b> In Arizona v. Hicks, the Supreme Court held that an officer stepped beyond the plain view doctrine when he moved a turntable in order to view its serial number to confirm that the turntable was stolen.

500|$|This {{is part of}} the [...] "orthodox" [...] or [...] "strict" [...] rule, {{along with}} Re Goldcorp. The {{exception}} to this rule is found in Hunter v Moss, which concerned 50 shares meant to be transferred to an employee out of a total holding of 950. These shares were not individually identified, but Dillon LJ held that this was irrelevant because the shares were all of the same type and in the same company, and so it made no difference which particular shares were transferred. This was applied in Re Harvard Securities, where Neuberger J held that there was a difference between tangible property, such as wine, and intangible property, such as shares. Intangible property, by <b>its</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature,</b> does not require segregation.|$|E
500|$|Devotions are [...] "external {{practices}} of piety" [...] {{which are not}} part of the official liturgy of the Catholic Church but are part of the popular spiritual {{practices of}} Catholics. Outside of Mariology, other devotional practices include the Stations of the Cross, the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Holy Face of Jesus, the various scapulars, novenas to various saints, pilgrimages and devotions to the Blessed Sacrament, and the veneration of saintly images such as the santos. The bishops at the Second Vatican Council reminded Catholics that [...] "devotions should be so drawn up that they harmonize with the liturgical seasons, accord with the sacred liturgy, are in some fashion derived from it, and lead the people to it, since, in fact, the liturgy by <b>its</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> far surpasses any of them." ...|$|E
