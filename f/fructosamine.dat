40|$|International audienceBackground: Free radical {{production}} is increased during diabetes. Serum albumin {{is a major}} antioxidant agent and albumin structural modifications induced by glucose or free radicals impair its antioxidant properties. Study Objectives: To compare antioxidant capacities and structural changes of albumin in diabetic patients treated with metformin (MET) or sulfonylureas (SU) and in healthy volunteers. Measurements and results: Albumin structural changes were studied by quenching of fluorescence {{in the presence of}} acrylamide. Albumin thiols and <b>fructosamines</b> reflecting respectively oxidization and glycation-induced changes of serum albumin were assessed. Albumin structural changes were demonstrated by a significant decrease in quenching of fluorescence in diabetic patients, MET patients exhibited a significant difference in albumin conformation as compared to SU patients. Oxidation resulting in a significant decrease in thiol groups, plasma total antioxidant capacity and glycation associated with a significant increase in <b>fructosamines</b> were both found when comparing healthy volunteers to diabetic patients. Comparing MET patients and SU patients oxidative stress and glycation were found to be significantly lower in MET patients. Conclusions: Diabetic patients demonstrated a reduction in serum albumin antioxidant properties that may aggravate oxidative stress and thus contribute to vascular and metabolic morbidities.

40|$|Fructosamine- 3 -kinase (FN 3 K) is {{an enzyme}} {{that appears to}} be {{responsible}} for the removal of <b>fructosamines</b> from proteins. In this study, we report the sequence of human and mouse cDNAs encoding proteins sharing 65 % sequence identity with FN 3 K. The genes encoding FN 3 K and FN 3 K-related protein (FN 3 K-RP) are present next to each other on human chromosome 17 q 25, and they both have a similar 6 -exon structure. Northern blots of mouse tissues RNAs indicate a high level of expression of both genes in bone marrow, brain, kidneys, and spleen. Human FN 3 K-RP was transfected in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, and the expressed protein was partially purified by chromatography on Blue Sepharose. Unlike FN 3 K, FN 3 K-RP did not phosphorylate fructoselysine, 1 -deoxy- 1 -morpholino-fructose, or lysozyme glycated with glucose. In a more systematic screening for potential substrates for FN 3 K-RP, we found, however, that both enzymes phosphorylated ketosamines with a D-configuration in C 3 (psicoselysine, 1 -deoxy- 1 -morpholino-psicose, 1 -deoxy- 1 -morpholino-ribulose, lysozyme glycated with allose-the C 3 epimer of glucose, or with ribose). Tandem mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the product of phosphorylation of 1 -deoxy- 1 -morpholino-psicose by FN 3 K-RP indicated that this enzyme phosphorylates the third carbon of the sugar moiety. These results indicate that FN 3 K-RP is a ketosamine- 3 -kinase (ketosamine- 3 -kinase 2). This enzyme presumably plays a role in freeing proteins from ribulosamines or psicosamines, which might arise in a several step process, from the reaction of amines with glucose and/or glycolytic intermediates. This role is shared by fructosamine- 3 -kinase (ketosamine- 3 -kinase 1), which has, in addition, the unique capacity to phosphorylate <b>fructosamines.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

The effects of glycation on erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase-I and II (CA-I and CA-II) in patients with Type-I diabetes mellitus (uncontrolled) were investigated using kinetic parameters. After blood glucose and hemolysate total esterase activity levels had been measured in both 10 control and 10 diabetic subjects, CA-I and CA-II in hemolysate were purified separately by affinity chromatography. The enzyme activity, <b>fructosamines,</b> Vmax, KM, and Ki values of CA-I and CA-II were determined. The means of the blood glucose and hemolysate total esterase activity levels were significantly higher in the diabetics than in the controls (p 0. 05). The means of the Ki values of both CA-I and CA-II, using acetazolamide and sulfanilamide inhibitors, were significantly lower in the diabetics than in the controls (p< 0. 001). Glycation was found to increase both CA activity and the inhibitory effect of acetazolamide and sulfonamide on CA activity. Since CA is a well-known enzyme regulating pH in most of the tissues in the body, changes in CA activity may be associated with metabolic diseases, especially in diabetes mellitus. Therefore, dosages of CA inhibitors should be considered carefully in the treatment of diabetic patients...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Human resistin {{has been}} stated to {{influence}} preadipocyte cell numbers and to stimulate adipocyte triglyceride lipolysis in vivo and in vitro. However, {{its role in}} human obesity remains unclear. Design: Cross-sectional study for comparisons of lean and obese subjects, and subsequent longitudinal 4 -month weight loss intervention study in obese subjects. Subjects: Healthy subjects, lean (n= 20, BMI = 25). Measurements: Serum resistin, body weight, body fat, waist-to-hip ratio, as well as markers of insulin resistance and lipid metabolism at baseline and after 4 months of intervention. Results: Serum resistin was positively correlated to HOMA-IR (partial r= 0. 288; P= 0. 055), serum <b>fructosamines</b> (partial r= 0. 280; P= 0. 062), serum NEFA (partial r= 0. 276; P= 0. 066) and negatively to age (partial r=- 0. 349; P= 0. 019) and serum apolipoprotein A- 1 (partial r=- 0. 363; P= 0. 014). During the intervention, serum resistin increased significantly (P < 0. 001). The increase was inversely related to changes in waist-to-hip ratio (P= 0. 025) and positively to serum apolipoprotein B (P= 0. 011). In males only, the increase in resistin during weight loss was predicted by total serum cholesterol at baseline (r= 0. 703, P= 0. 007). No relation was observed between changes in resistin and changes in HOMA-IR. Conclusion: The present study indicates an association between serum resistin and markers of abdominal fat distribution {{as well as the}} regulation of lipid metabolism. However, human resistin is unlikely to play an independent role in the regulation of glucose metabolism...|$|R
40|$|Glycation of {{proteins}} forms <b>fructosamines</b> and advanced glycation endproducts. Glycation adducts may be risk markers and {{risk factors of}} disease development. We measured the concentrations of the early glycation adduct fructosyl-lysine and 12 advanced glycation endproducts by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Underivatized analytes were detected free in physiological fluids and in enzymic hydrolysates of cellular and extracellular proteins. Hydroimidazolones {{were the most important}} glycation biomarkers quantitatively; monolysyl adducts (N(epsilon) -carboxymethyl-lysine and N(epsilon) - 1 -carboxyethyl-lysine) were found in moderate amounts, and bis(lysyl) imidazolium cross-links and pentosidine in lowest amounts. Quantitative screening showed high levels of advanced glycation endproducts in cellular protein and moderate levels in protein of blood plasma. Glycation adduct accumulation in tissues depended on the particular adduct and tissue type. Low levels of free advanced glycation endproducts were found in blood plasma and levels were 10 - 100 -fold higher in urine. Advanced glycation endproduct residues were increased in blood plasma and at sites of vascular complications development in experimental diabetes; renal glomeruli, retina and peripheral nerve. In clinical uraemia, the concentrations of plasma protein advanced glycation endproduct residues increased 1 - 7 -fold and free adduct concentrations increased up to 50 -fold. Comprehensive screening of glycation adducts revealed the relative and quantitative importance of alpha-oxoaldehyde-derived advanced glycation endproducts in physiological modification {{of proteins}}-particularly hydroimidazolones, the efficient renal clearance of free adducts, and the marked increases of glycation adducts in diabetes and uraemia-particularly free advanced glycation endproducts in uraemia.

50|$|In practice, <b>fructosamine</b> {{is rarely}} {{measured}} clinically (even in individuals with hemoglobinopathies or other red cell disorders) {{due to a}} number of pragmatic concerns. First, diabetes care is rarely changed in short (1-4 week) intervals, since diabetes medications can take months to reach a steady state. An exception to this is pregnancy, where medication needs can change more rapidly and <b>fructosamine</b> may help provide closer short-term monitoring. Second, <b>fructosamine</b> has higher variability than A1c tests. Third, the overwhelming majority of studies in diabetes care are based on A1c measurements, which can make <b>fructosamine</b> results difficult to interpret. Fourth, the A1c test is very well standardized and trusted due to its nearly universal use. A variety of more advanced forms of the A1c test (e.g. some types of HPLC, immunoassay and capillary electrophoresis) can more accurately assay A1c levels during complex hemoglobinopathies and other conditions.

30|$|Concisely, in this study, we have {{demonstrated}} a colorimetric sensing {{mechanism for the}} non-proteinaceous AGE products which is simple and highly sensitive with a detection limit down to nanogram levels. Conditions like type 2 diabetes requires continuous monitoring of sugar levels at regular time intervals. Currently, levels of HbA 1 c formed {{as a result of}} extensive glycation of haemoglobin is used as a diagnostic means for diabetes. Chromatographic [67], electrophoretic and advanced technologies including high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) [12, 46 – 49, 68] are used for HbA 1 c detection. Early glycation adducts including <b>fructosamines</b> are also indicative of the glycemic control [69] which {{can be used as a}} marker for diabetes detection. Monitoring the AGE levels in addition to the HbA 1 c levels can significantly improve the determination the degree of complexity associated with diabetes, since the advancement of the disease is often associated with AGE formation and is involved in the progression of the disorder as well. Till date, the LC-MS/MS offers the highest selectivity and sensitivity in AGE detection [70]. But when it comes to simple, cost-effective, point-of-care diagnostics, our method can detect few nanograms of the sample compared to other fluorescence emission-based techniques [71, 72]. The method is highly specific for the AGEs, such that sugars and proteins do not develop any colour as such which are the expected interferences in the clinical samples such as blood or serum for the proposed study (Additional file 1 section 7). In this study, we have also segregated the products of glycation to proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous components and proved that non-proteinaceous AGEs are more reactive by the GNP based colorimetric assay. Further research can explore how this idea can be expanded for the distinction between different AGEs and thereby apply it for the diagnosis of organ specific diabetes-related complications.|$|R
