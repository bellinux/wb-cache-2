5|$|In June 2009, a {{group of}} {{consumers}} filed the class action suits Owens v. Apple, Inc. and Johnson v. Apple Inc. against Apple on behalf of American individuals who purchased iTunes <b>gift</b> <b>cards</b> and who were then unable to use the cards to purchase iTunes music at the price advertised on the card because Apple raised {{the price of the}} music after it sold the cards to consumers. The Johnson case absorbed the Owens case and was settled on February 10, 2012, with payments to be made to consumers by Apple. The Owens complaint alleged that Apple wrongfully marketed, distributed, and sold iTunes <b>gift</b> <b>cards</b> and songs through its online iTunes store, while representing that consumers could use the <b>gift</b> <b>cards</b> to purchase songs for US$.99 a song and then, after such <b>gift</b> <b>cards</b> were purchased, raised the price on certain songs to $1.29 on April 7, 2009. The lawsuit's allegations included that Apple's conduct constituted breach of contract, violated the state consumer fraud statute, and violated consumer protection statutes of other states. The plaintiffs sought a $.30 refund remedy for each song that class members purchased using a $.99 iTunes card for which they were charged $1.29, plus their attorneys' fees and costs. Apple mounted a vigorous defense and sought to dismiss the suit but lost its motion in December 2009. Individuals are part of the class of plaintiffs if they are U.S. residents who purchased or received an iTunes Gift Card on which the card itself or its packaging contained language to the effect that songs were priced at $0.99 and who used the card to purchase one or more $1.29 songs from the iTunes Store on or before May 10, 2010. The settlement provides class members with an iTunes Store credit of $3.25 if an online claim form was submitted on or before September 24, 2012.|$|E

50|$|A charity <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> {{allows a}} <b>gift</b> giver {{to make a}} {{charitable}} donation that the gift recipient may direct to the charity of their choice. Although a charity <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> has many similarities to a store <b>gift</b> <b>card,</b> a charity <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> functions quite differently. A charity <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> is an indicator of control over a small donor advised fund. The purchaser of the charity <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> creates the donor advised fund with the charity <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> purchase money. When the charity <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> recipient “spends” the <b>gift</b> <b>card,</b> the recipient is in actuality advising the holder of the associated donor advised fund (typically the charity that issued the charity <b>gift</b> <b>card)</b> to send {{the money to the}} charity that the charity <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> recipient selects.|$|R
40|$|Archival data of {{unrestricted}} {{and restricted}} <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> transactions was compared with national level consumer spending data {{from both the}} U. S. and Canada to investigate {{the similarities and differences}} in purchase pattern. The objective for this comparison was to investigate the motivational power of unrestricted <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> compared to cash rewards, restricted <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> and other hedonic tangible incentive. Through results interpretation, the data supported the hypotheses that people perceive and use unrestricted <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> as a cash carrying medium rather than a tangible reward. A restricted <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> that is hedonic by design constrains its recipients to hedonic purchase and removes the guilt and eliminates the justification process. The results also suggested that the elimination of justification seems to be associated to not only the hedonic dimension of goods/services but also transaction size...|$|R

In addition, holiday shoppers are planning to buy even more cards this year: an average of 5.5 cards, compared with the 4.6 cards they planned to buy last year. One in six consumers (16 percent) plan to buy 10 or more cards, compared with 11 percent last year. Consumers are also spending more in total on <b>gift</b> <b>cards</b> and more per card: $36.25 per card on average compared with $30.22 last year. <b>Gift</b> <b>cards</b> continue to grow in acceptance: Almost four in 10 consumers surveyed (39 percent) would rather get a gift card than merchandise, an increase from last year’s 35 percent. Also, resistance to giving <b>gift</b> <b>cards</b> continues to decline: 19 percent say they don’t like to give <b>gift</b> <b>cards</b> because they’re too impersonal (down from 22 percent last year). Consumers said that the cards are popular gifts for adults, teens and children alike, and almost half (46 percent) intend to buy them for immediate family; however, they are hesitant to buy them for spouses or significant others, with only 14 percent saying they plan to buy them for those recipients.|$|E
