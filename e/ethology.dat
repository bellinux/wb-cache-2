5|$|Contemporary {{scientists}} in <b>ethology</b> and evolutionary psychology seek to explain conscience {{as a function}} of the brain that evolved to facilitate altruism within societies.|$|E
5|$|All organisms can exhibit behaviours. Even plants express complex behaviour, {{including}} {{memory and}} communication. Behavioural ecology {{is the study}} of an organism's behaviour in its environment and its ecological and evolutionary implications. <b>Ethology</b> {{is the study of}} observable movement or behaviour in animals. This could include investigations of motile sperm of plants, mobile phytoplankton, zooplankton swimming toward the female egg, the cultivation of fungi by weevils, the mating dance of a salamander, or social gatherings of amoeba.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ethology</b> is {{the study}} of animal {{behavior}} (particularly that of social animals such as primates and canids), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of natural selection. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, influenced many ethologists to come.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have been}} the focus of {{monographic}} series, action plans, field guides, and classic works in <b>ethology.</b> However, few species have been thoroughly studied to date, and most research has been preliminary and restricted to a single locality. Only recently have numerous scientific papers been published to explain the basic aspects of behavior and ecology of poorly known species. Field studies have given insights on population dynamics and evolutionary ecology of most genera and many species. Long-term research focused on identified individuals is in its infancy and has only been started for a few populations. However, learning opportunities are dwindling as habitat destruction and other factors threaten the existence of lemur populations across the island.|$|E
5|$|Understanding {{traits of}} {{individual}} organisms helps explain patterns and processes at other levels of organization including populations, communities, and ecosystems. Several areas of ecology of evolution {{that focus on}} such traits are life history theory, ecophysiology, metabolic theory of ecology, and <b>Ethology.</b> Examples of such traits include features of an organisms life cycle such as age to maturity, life span, or metabolic costs of reproduction. Other traits {{may be related to}} structure, such as the spines of a cactus or dorsal spines of a bluegill sunfish, or behaviors such as courtship displays or pair bonding. Other traits include emergent properties that are the result at least in part of interactions with the surrounding environment such as growth rate, resource uptake rate, winter, and deciduous vs. drought deciduous trees and shrubs.|$|E
5|$|Over the 18th and 19th centuries, {{biological}} sciences such as botany and zoology became increasingly professional scientific disciplines. Lavoisier and other physical scientists began {{to connect the}} animate and inanimate worlds through physics and chemistry. Explorer-naturalists such as Alexander von Humboldt investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography—laying the foundations for biogeography, ecology and <b>ethology.</b> Naturalists began to reject essentialism and consider the importance of extinction and the mutability of species. Cell theory provided {{a new perspective on}} the fundamental basis of life. These developments, as well as the results from embryology and paleontology, were synthesized in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of spontaneous generation {{and the rise of the}} germ theory of disease, though the mechanism of inheritance remained a mystery.|$|E
5|$|Whilst Bowlby's early {{writings}} on maternal deprivation {{may be seen}} as part of the background to the later development of attachment theory, there are many significant differences between the two. At the time of the 1951 publication, there was little research in this area and no comprehensive theory on the development of early relationships. Aside from its central proposition of the importance of an early, continuous and sensitive relationship, the monograph concentrates mostly on social policy. For his subsequent development of attachment theory, Bowlby drew on concepts from <b>ethology,</b> cybernetics, information processing, developmental psychology and psychoanalysis. The first early formal statements of attachment theory were presented in three papers in 1958, 1959 and 1960. His major work Attachment was published in three volumes between 1969 and 1980. Attachment theory revolutionised thinking on the nature of early attachments and extensive research continues to be undertaken.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, the English {{ethologist}} John H. Crook {{published an}} important paper {{in which he}} distinguished comparative <b>ethology</b> from social <b>ethology,</b> and argued {{that much of the}} <b>ethology</b> that had existed so far was really comparative ethology—examining animals as individuals—whereas, in the future, ethologists would need to concentrate on the behaviour of social groups of animals and the social structure within them.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the work}} of Lorenz and Tinbergen, <b>ethology</b> {{developed}} strongly in continental Europe during the years prior to World War II. After the war, Tinbergen moved to the University of Oxford, and <b>ethology</b> became stronger in the UK, with the additional influence of William Thorpe, Robert Hinde, and Patrick Bateson at the Sub-department of Animal Behaviour of the University of Cambridge, located in the village of Madingley. In this period, too, <b>ethology</b> began to develop strongly in North America.|$|E

25|$|<b>Ethology</b> is the {{scientific}} and objective study of animal behaviour, usually {{with a focus on}} behaviour under natural conditions, and viewing behaviour as an evolutionarily adaptive trait. Behaviourism is a term that also describes {{the scientific}} and objective study of animal behaviour, usually referring to measured responses to stimuli or trained behavioural responses in a laboratory context, without a particular emphasis on evolutionary adaptivity. Many naturalists have studied aspects of animal behaviour throughout history. <b>Ethology</b> has its scientific roots in the work of Charles Darwin and of American and German ornithologists of the late 19th and early 20th century, including Charles O. Whitman, Oskar Heinroth, and Wallace Craig. The modern discipline of <b>ethology</b> is generally considered to have begun during the 1930s with the work of Dutch biologist Nikolaas Tinbergen and by Austrian biologists Konrad Lorenz and Karl von Frisch, joint awardees of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. <b>Ethology</b> is a combination of laboratory and field science, with a strong relation to some other disciplines such as neuroanatomy, ecology, and evolutionary biology. Ethologists are typically interested in a behavioural process rather than in a particular animal group, and often study one type of behaviour, such as aggression, in a number of unrelated animals.|$|E
25|$|Comparative {{psychology}} also studies animal behaviour, but, {{as opposed}} to <b>ethology,</b> is construed as a sub-topic of psychology rather than as one of biology. Historically, where comparative psychology has included research on animal behaviour {{in the context of}} what is known about human psychology, <b>ethology</b> involves research on animal behaviour in the context of what is known about animal anatomy, physiology, neurobiology, and phylogenetic history. Furthermore, early comparative psychologists concentrated on the study of learning and tended to research behaviour in artificial situations, whereas early ethologists concentrated on behaviour in natural situations, tending to describe it as instinctive.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{along with}} ethologists, many biologists, zoologists, primatologists, anthropologists, veterinarians, and {{physicians}} study <b>ethology</b> {{and other related}} fields such as animal psychology, the study of animal social groups, animal cognition and animal welfare science.|$|E
25|$|Zoophilia {{has been}} partly {{discussed}} by several sciences: Psychology (the {{study of the}} human mind), sexology (a relatively new discipline primarily studying human sexuality), <b>ethology</b> (the study of animal behavior), and anthrozoology (the study of human-animal interactions and bonds).|$|E
25|$|Mottershead {{wanted to}} build a zoo without the {{traditional}} Victorian iron bars to cage the animals. He was influenced by the ideas of Carl Hagenbeck, who invented the modern zoo concept and by Heini Hediger, a pioneer of <b>ethology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Stevens (1982) {{suggests}} that <b>ethology</b> and analytical psychology are both disciplines trying to comprehend universal phenomena. <b>Ethology</b> {{shows us that}} each species is equipped with unique behavioural capacities that are adapted to its environment and 'even allowing for our greater adaptive flexibility, we are no exception. Archetypes are the neuropsychic centres responsible for co-ordinating the behavioural and psychic repertoire of our species'. Following Bowlby, Stevens points out that genetically programmed behaviour {{is taking place in}} the psychological relationship between mother and newborn. The baby's helplessness, its immense repertoire of sign stimuli and approach behaviour, triggers a maternal response. And the smell, sound and shape of mother triggers, for instance, a feeding response.|$|E
25|$|Wes Burgess is a psychiatrist, scientist, {{and author}} {{who has written}} books, book chapters, and over 100 {{scholarly}} articles on psychiatry, psychology, animal behavior (<b>ethology),</b> nonverbal communication, and human consciousness. His main contribution {{has been to the}} understanding of the mind and social relationships.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ethology</b> is {{a rapidly}} growing field. Since {{the dawn of the}} 21st century, many aspects of animal communication, emotions, culture, {{learning}} and sexuality that the scientific community long thought it understood have been re-examined, and new conclusions reached. New fields, such as neuroethology, have developed.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary biology as an {{academic}} discipline emerged with the modern synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s. In the 1930s the study of animal behavior (<b>ethology)</b> emerged {{with the work of}} the Dutch biologist Nikolaas Tinbergen and the Austrian biologists Konrad Lorenz and Karl von Frisch.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergence}} of paleoanthropology, a scientific discipline which {{draws on the}} methodologies of paleontology, physical anthropology and <b>ethology,</b> among other disciplines, and increasing in scope and momentum from the mid-20th century, continues to yield further insights into human origins, evolution, genetic and cultural heritage, and perspectives on the contemporary human predicament as well.|$|E
25|$|Ethologists {{expressed}} concern about the adequacy of some of the research on which attachment theory was based, particularly the generalisation to humans from animal studies. Schur, discussing Bowlby's use of ethological concepts (pre-1960) commented that these concepts as used in attachment theory had not kept up with changes in <b>ethology</b> itself.|$|E
25|$|Understanding <b>ethology</b> {{or animal}} {{behaviour}} can {{be important in}} animal training. Considering the natural behaviours of different species or breeds enables the trainer to select the individuals best suited to perform the required task. It also enables the trainer to encourage the performance of naturally occurring behaviours and also the discontinuance of undesirable behaviours.|$|E
25|$|Some animals may use {{tactical}} deception, with behaviour that is {{deployed in}} a way that other animals misinterpret what is happening to the advantage of the agent. Some of the evidence for this is anecdotal, but in the great apes in particular, experimental studies in <b>ethology</b> suggest that deception is actively practised by some animals.|$|E
25|$|She {{became a}} key figure and expert in <b>ethology</b> – concentrating on the {{behavior}} of tropical animals, jumping spiders, praying mantises, butterflies and most importantly, fiddler crabs. Her lifelong research on fiddler crabs -- researching their morphology, systematics, biogeography and behavior -- was published in her 1975 seminal work Fiddler Crabs of the World.|$|E
25|$|Van der Horst, Van der Veer, and Van IJzendoorn write:Bowlby spurred Hinde {{to start}} his ground {{breaking}} work on attachment and separation in primates (monkeys and humans), and in general {{emphasized the importance of}} evolutionary thinking about human development that foreshadowed the new interdisciplinary approach of evolutionary psychology. Obviously, the encounter of <b>ethology</b> and attachment theory led to a genuine cross-fertilization.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of basic}} {{technology}} {{is also a}} feature of other animal species apart from humans. These include primates such as chimpanzees, some dolphin communities, and crows. Considering a more generic perspective of technology as <b>ethology</b> of active environmental conditioning and control, we can also refer to animal examples such as beavers and their dams, or bees and their honeycombs.|$|E
25|$|This schema {{constitutes}} a basic {{framework of the}} overlapping behavioural fields of <b>ethology,</b> behavioural ecology, comparative psychology, sociobiology, evolutionary psychology, and anthropology. It was in fact Julian Huxley who identified the first three questions, Niko Tinbergen gave only the fourth question, but Julian Huxley's questions failed to distinguish between survival value and evolutionary history, so Tinbergen's fourth question helped resolve this problem.|$|E

25|$|Citron has organized, managed, and/or {{participated in}} more than 60 {{scientific}} field research expeditions in Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, and the South Pacific in fields that include volcanic eruption research, paleoanthropology, archaeology, anthropology, ecology, <b>ethology,</b> zoology, astronomy, meteoritics, and geophysics. He has participated in eight total solar eclipse expeditions in the Philippines, Mexico, Canada, Turkey, Mauritania, Ethiopia, India, and the Libyan Sahara between 1956 and 2006.|$|E
25|$|The {{convex hull}} is {{commonly}} known as the minimum convex polygon (MCP) in <b>ethology,</b> where it is a classic, though perhaps simplistic, approach in estimating an animal's home range based on points where the animal has been observed. Outliers can make the MCP excessively large, which has motivated relaxed approaches that contain only a subset of the observations (e.g., find an MCP that contains at least 95% of the points).|$|E
25|$|Animal locomotion, in <b>ethology,</b> is any of {{a variety}} of {{movements}} or methods that animals use to move from one place to another. Some modes of locomotion are (initially) self-propelled, e.g., running, swimming, jumping, flying, hopping, soaring and gliding. There are also many animal species that depend on their environment for transportation, a type of mobility called passive locomotion, e.g., sailing (some jellyfish), kiting (spiders) and rolling (some beetles and spiders).|$|E
25|$|In {{the science}} of <b>ethology</b> (the study of animal behaviour), and more {{generally}} {{in the study of}} social evolution, altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor. In evolutionary psychology this may be applied {{to a wide range of}} human behaviors such as charity, emergency aid, help to coalition partners, tipping, courtship gifts, production of public goods, and environmentalism.|$|E
