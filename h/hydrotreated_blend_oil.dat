40|$|AbstractThe {{experiments}} {{were conducted by}} using the hydrotreated refined sunflower oil as alternative fuel in a 4 -stroke, stationary DI diesel engine at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. The effects of <b>hydrotreated</b> vegetable <b>oil</b> <b>blends</b> on diesel engine emission and performance were studied. The emission and performance were studied for different proportions such as HTSF B 25 and HTSF B 100 and at different loading conditions and comparison was made with petrodiesel. The emission and performance results of HTSF B 25 and HTSF B 100 showed that decrease in CO by 9 % and 37 %, HC by 42 % and 55 %, NOx by 10 % and 18. 18 %, BSFC by 25 % and 12. 5 %. The increase in brake thermal efficiency was by 10 % and 38 %.

Oil degradation was monitored by analysis of the acid value (AV), peroxide value (PV), p-anisidine value (p-AV), color, and trans-fatty acid composition. The fatty acid ratios of EAEPO, HEBO, and the three kinds of <b>blended</b> <b>oils</b> were very similar (0. 27 [*]:[*] 1. 03 [*]:[*] 0. 96, 0. 27 [*]:[*] 1. 08 [*]:[*] 1. 16, 0. 27 [*]:[*] 0. 65 [*]:[*] 0. 8, 0. 27 [*]:[*] 0. 6 [*]:[*] 0. 84, and 0. 27 [*]:[*] 0. 61 [*]:[*] 0. 79, resp.). The AV and color increased {{in proportion to the}} heating time for all the oils. There was a rapid increase in the PV and p-AV of EAEPO and HEBO after heating for only 1 [*]h, whereas the other three <b>blended</b> <b>oils</b> showed a rapid increase after heating for 2 [*]h or 6 [*]h. Despite the highest trans-fatty acid content found for HEBO, this content was relatively low and remained low up to a heating time of 8 [*]h. It was found that after heating, a fatty acid ratio relatively close to its ideal value (0. 27 [*]:[*] 0. 48 [*]:[*] 0. 49) was maintained by EAEPO, which indicates that EAEPO is tolerant to heat treatment and is suitable for maintaining a healthy diet...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{chemical}} compositions {{of waste}} cooking methyl ester (WCME) {{were analyzed by}} GC-MS, and the cold flow properties of WCME were studied by cold filer plugging point tester and viscosity tester. Through blending with petrodiesel and adding cold flow improver (CFI), the cold flow properties of WCME were improved efficiently. The study shows that WCME was mainly composed of saturated fatty acid methyl ester (SFAME) and unsaturated fatty acid methyl ester (UFAME), and contents of SFAME and UFAME were 27. 63 and 71. 81 w%, respectively. The cold filer plugging point (CFPP) of WCME was 0 ℃, and the viscosity of it was 4. 41 mm 2 ·s- 1 at 40 ℃. Blending with 0 petrodiesel (0 PD) and- 10 petrodiesel (- 10 PD) decreased the CFPP of WCME to- 4 ℃ and- 13 ℃, respectively.

40|$|Several {{atmospheric}} residues (AR) of Kuwaiti crude, in the absence, {{or in the}} presence, {{of light}} cycle oil (LCO) as an aromatic additive, were hydrotreated in an experimental plant. Asphaltenes (precipitated from Kuwaiti AR, a hydrotreated AR, and a <b>hydrotreated</b> <b>blend</b> of AR and LCO) were characterised by chemical structure and changes during residue hydrotreatment. The average structural parameters of these asphaltenes, obtained from a combined method of element analysis, average molecular weight, X-ray diffraction, and NMR, demonstrate that, after hydrotreatment, the aromatic cores of the asphaltenes become more compact and smaller whereas the peripheral alkyl branches are decreased in number and shortened. The influence of LCO on residue hydrotreating is also studied in terms of structural changes in the asphaltenes. The findings imply that LCO added to AR during hydrotreating improves the degree of aromatic substitution, the total hydrogen/carbon atomic ratio per average molecule, the distance between aromatic sheets and aliphatic chains, and so forth, by modifying the colloidal nature and microstructure of asphaltene: this is beneficial for the further hydroprocessing of AR.

The different oil sources did not influence egg production, egg weight, egg mass, feed intake, feed efficiency, Haugh unit or egg shell thickness. However lipid profile of the egg yolk changed {{as a function of}} dietary lipid sources. The fatty acid composition of egg yolks produced by the laying hens was analyzed. The fatty acid profile of eggs can be modified by varying the lipid composition of their diet. High inclusion levels of dietary palm olein <b>oil</b> (POO) or <b>blended</b> <b>oil</b> (POO plus soybean oil - SBO) concentrations of total saturated fatty acid (SFA) in egg yolks decreased, with SFA = 24. 8167 - 0. 63 Oil, r 2 = 0. 66 (P < 0. 05). Eggs laid by hens fed the diet containing a high portion of soybean oil had a large amount of n- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), whereas egg laid by hens fed the diet containing POO or <b>blended</b> <b>oil</b> 25 % POO plus 75 % SBO at 1. 5 % level of inclusion had a high percentage of n- 3 PUFA and n- 9 family.

Thirty-eight mildly hyperlipidemic subjects consumed a low-fat diet for 2 wk. They were then allocated to 2 groups and underwent 3 dietary interventions for 3 wk each in random order (diets contained 35 % of energy as fat with 20 % of energy as margarines or butter) : group 1 (n = 18), butter, canola <b>oil</b> <b>blend</b> with TFAs, and TFA-free canola oil blend: group 2 (n = 19), butter, polyunsaturated <b>oil</b> <b>blend</b> with TFAs, and TFA-free polyunsaturated <b>oil</b> <b>blend.</b> Plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations after consumption of all <b>oil</b> <b>blends</b> and after the low-fat diet were not significantly different, but were 11 - 15 % lower than after butter (P < 0. 001). Whereas the canola <b>oil</b> <b>blends</b> {{did not differ from}} each other in their effects on lipoprotein profiles, the TFA-free polyunsaturated <b>oil</b> <b>blend</b> resulted in a significant 6 % reduction (- 0. 25 mmol/L; 95 % CI: - 0. 08, - 0. 42) in total and LDL cholesterol compared with the blend containing TFAs (P = 0. 006). In the canola <b>oil</b> <b>blend,</b> 10 % TFAs and 6 % oleic acid were replaced by approximately 14 % saturated fatty acids plus a 2 % increase in linoleic acid.

40|$|Selenium, an {{essential}} micromineral, is a co-factor of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase. This enzyme {{is involved in}} cell membrane protection against oxidative damage resulting from reactive oxygen species production. Besides the importance of preservation of unsaturated fatty acids in fish, world aquaculture has been seeking for alternative oil sources in diet of fish. Thus, the main goal of this research work was to study the antioxidant capacity of meagre (Argyrossomus regius) fed with different levels of vegetable <b>blend</b> <b>oil</b> with and without selenium in replacement of traditional diets containing fish oil. Meagre (600 animals) were kept in 24 tanks (80 L) with constant renovation and aeration and maintained at 20. 7 ± 0. 7 ºC and oxygen 8. 8 ± 1. 7 mg L - 1. Fish were fed twice per day, six days per week, with eight different experimental diets for 60 days. Diets were formulated to have two different oil sources (fish or vegetable <b>blend</b> <b>oils</b> with 45 % of linseed, 35 % of rapeseed and 20 % of soybean oil), two lipid levels (12 and 17 %) and two selenium supplementation (0 and 1 mg/kg diet). Lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), total glutathione (TG) and catalase (CAT) were analyzed in liver of fish. CAT, GPx and GR activities were not significantly altered in fish fed with diets with different oil sources. However, TG in fish fed with fish oil diet was higher than the levels observed in fish fed with vegetable <b>blend</b> <b>oil.</b> Furthermore, fish fed with fish oil diet showed lower lipid peroxidation when compared with fish fed vegetable <b>blend</b> <b>oil</b> diet (Table 1). Concerning the oil level in diet, {{it was observed that}} fish fed with a diet of 17 % lipids had a higher level of total glutathione when compared to fish fed with a diet of 12 % lipids. On the other hand, the fish fed with a diet with 12 % lipids showed lower levels of lipid peroxidation when compared to fish fed with a diet of 17 % lipids. Fish fed with diets supplemented with selenium showed a significantly increased activity of GPx when compared with fish fed without selenium. Three-way ANOVA analysis showed that dietary lipid level and the presence of selenium have a significant interaction on the activities of CAT and GR, as well as, levels of TG and LPO. A significant interaction between the source of oil and the presence of selenium on GR activities was observed. Interaction on source and level was observed to CAT. In conclusion, the antioxidant capacity of meagre is influenced by the source of oil, the level of lipids and the presence of selenium in their diet. </p...|$|R
