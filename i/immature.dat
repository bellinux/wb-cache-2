5|$|<b>Immature</b> American {{white and}} scarlet ibises are very {{difficult}} to tell apart, although scarlet ibises tend to have darker legs and bare skin around the face. An <b>immature</b> American white ibis could be mistaken for an <b>immature</b> glossy ibis, but the latter is wholly dark brown and lacks the white belly and rump. The adult is distinguishable from the wood stork, which is much larger and its wings have more black on them.|$|E
5|$|<b>Immature</b> red wattlebirds are {{generally}} less flamboyant. Juveniles have much less prominent wattles, brown irises, a pale crown {{and much less}} yellow on the belly. They moult into first <b>immature</b> plumage {{within a few months}} of leaving the nest. First <b>immature</b> birds are more similar to adults overall, having red irises with brown rings, wattles larger but still smaller than adults, and a greyish pink gape.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} overall size and crest size also {{corresponds}} to age. <b>Immature</b> specimens are known from both females and males, and <b>immature</b> males often have small crests similar to adult females. Therefore, {{it seems that the}} large crests only developed in males when they reached their large, adult size, making the sex of <b>immature</b> specimens difficult to establish from partial remains.|$|E
40|$|<b>Immatures</b> of Acanthocinini (Coleoptera, Cerambycidae, Lamiinae). Larva and pupa of Eutrypanus dorsalis (Germar, 1928), {{collected}} in trunks of Pinus elliottii Engelm., and Paratenthras martinsi Monné, 1998, {{collected in}} spathes of Scheelea phalerata (Mart. ex Spreng.) Burret, are described and illustrated. Larva and pupa of Lophopoeum timbouvae Lameere, 1884, collected in Hymenaea corbaril L., Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vell.) Morong and Pterogyne nitens Tul., are redescribed and illustrated. A table with all described <b>immatures</b> of Lamiinae, and a comparison among the <b>immatures</b> of Acanthocinini are presented.

5|$|Nestlings have dark grey {{or brown}} down, cream to grey bills, cream gapes and orange throats. The plumage of {{juvenile}} birds {{in their first}} moult resembles that of the adult female, but the head and upperparts are streaked and slightly darker. Soon after fledging, juveniles moult into their first <b>immature</b> plumage, and more closely resemble the adult female. The breasts of male birds may have some orange feathers. Birds in their second year moult into a second <b>immature</b> phase, some males of which may resemble adult males, while others retain a more <b>immature</b> brown plumage. Determining the age and sex of birds in brown plumage can be very difficult. Information on exact timing of moulting is lacking, but the replacement of primary feathers takes place over the summer months between December and February.|$|E
5|$|The <b>immature</b> plumages of Arctic tern were {{originally}} described as separate species, Sterna portlandica and Sterna pikei.|$|E
50|$|<b>Immatures</b> have pale pterostigmata {{and only}} develop the {{characteristic}} two-coloured pterostigmata when mature.|$|R
50|$|Females and <b>immatures</b> have olive upperparts, yellow underparts and a grey {{head and}} neck.|$|R
50|$|The female {{is fairly}} {{similar to the}} male, but <b>immatures</b> have a weaker patterning.|$|R
5|$|A {{large number}} of insects live either part or the whole of their lives underwater. In {{many of the more}} {{primitive}} orders of insect, the <b>immature</b> stages are spent in an aquatic environment. Some groups of insects, like certain water beetles, have aquatic adults as well.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{considered}} poisonous, P.fusiformis {{is not recommended}} for consumption. Some related species such as Phallus impudicus or Mutinus caninus {{are considered to be}} edible (or even delicacies) in the <b>immature</b> egg stage; however, the foul smell of stinkhorns at maturity would likely deter most individuals from eating them.|$|E
5|$|Cuban iguanas reach sexual {{maturity}} {{at an age}} of two to three years. Males are gregarious when <b>immature,</b> but become more aggressive as they age, vigorously defending territories in competition for females. Females are more tolerant of each other, except after laying their eggs.|$|E

25|$|The drake's bill is dark grey, in {{eclipse plumage}} often with some light greenish or {{brownish}} hue at the base. The bill of hens and <b>immatures</b> is pinkish or yellowish at the base, becoming dark grey towards the tip; the grey expands basewards as the birds age. The feet are dark grey in males and greyish olive or greyish-brown in females and <b>immatures.</b> The iris is always brown.|$|R
5|$|Green {{the color}} most {{commonly}} associated in Europe and the U.S. with youth. It also often {{is used to}} describe anyone young, inexperienced, probably by the analogy to <b>immature</b> and unripe fruit. Examples include green cheese, a term for a fresh, unaged cheese, and greenhorn, an inexperienced person.|$|E
5|$|<b>Immature</b> {{birds are}} {{distinguished}} by their smaller size, smaller, duller-brown bill, dark grey chin and throat, and absent or underdeveloped head plumes, often just {{a scattering of}} yellow feathers. The crest is fully developed in birds aged three to four years, {{a year or two}} before breeding age.|$|E
5|$|<b>Immature</b> {{birds have}} duller and less demarcated plumage. The head is a sooty black, {{sometimes}} {{with a faint}} greenish sheen and brown feather bases visible; the back and side of the neck are dark grey and the underparts greyish or sooty black. The tail has narrower feathers and a greenish sheen.|$|E

40|$|Since 2000, the Government of Viet Nam has {{committed}} to provide rural communities with increased access to safe water {{through a variety of}} household water supply schemes (wells, ferrocement tanks and jars) and piped water schemes. One possible, unintended consequence of these schemes is the concomitant increase in water containers that may serve as habitats for dengue mosquito <b>immatures,</b> principally Aedes aegypti. To assess these possible impacts we undertook detailed household surveys of Ae. aegypti <b>immatures,</b> water storage containers and various socioeconomic factors in three rural communes in southern Viet Nam. Positive relationships between the numbers of household water storage containers and the prevalence and abundance of Ae. aegypti <b>immatures</b> were found. Overall, water storage containers accounted for 92 - 97...|$|R
5|$|In a {{study of}} spider populations in western Tennessee, Zygoballus sexpunctatus spiderlings were {{reported}} to hatch from egg sacs in mid summer. The spiders hibernated through the winter in an <b>immature</b> form and reached sexual maturity around late April.|$|E
5|$|In early pregnancy, {{levels of}} estrogen, progesterone, {{estradiol}} increase, leading to breast growth {{in preparation for}} lactation. It has been hypothesized that if this process is interrupted by an abortionbefore full maturity (differentiation) in the third trimesterthen more <b>immature</b> cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy. These <b>immature</b> cells could then be exposed to carcinogens and hormones over time, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer. This mechanism was first proposed and explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Lunar swirls are enigmatic {{features}} found {{across the}} Moon's surface, which {{are characterized by}} a high albedo, appearing optically <b>immature</b> (i.e. the optical characteristics of a relatively young regolith), and often displaying a sinuous shape. Their curvilinear shape is often accentuated by low albedo regions that wind between the bright swirls.|$|E

40|$|Bird {{populations were}} studied during the 1979 {{breeding}} season {{by means of}} the mist-net technique in 3 areas of central Newfoundland in an attempt to identify possible longer-term effects of the 1978 application of the insecticide Matacil. Raw data obtained for 2 of the areas during the 1978 breeding season were used for comparative purposes. Structural features of the vegetation were measured at all net sites in 1979. These data were subjected to a principal components analysis to determine relationships among the measured variables. The percentage variation of the distribution attributable to vegetation differences between net sites was determined for the adults and <b>immatures</b> of 7 passeriform species by step-wise multiple regression analyses. The numbers of adults and <b>immatures</b> of these species expected at each sprayed area {{on the basis of the}} vegetation were obtained from regression equations developed from the control area data. Blood parasite levels were investigated in an attempt to gain indirect evidence of the impact of the spray applications on the insect population and hence on the food supply available for insect-eating birds. [...] The number of parulid <b>immatures</b> captured at the control area was higher than at the sprayed areas. Adults of 4 species occurred at the sprayed areas in lower numbers than predicted by the regression equations. <b>Immatures</b> of 6 species at Big Careless Cove Brook and 5 species at Little Careless Cove Brook also occurred in lower numbers than predicted by the regression equations. No trends were detected among the areas in the blood parasite levels of the birds. [...] The 1978 aerial application of Matacil appears to have directly and/or indirectly affected the avian communities of the areas studied. The high numbers of <b>immatures</b> at the control area probably result from <b>immatures</b> invading the area to forage on the high density spruce budworm population. Comparably, the low numbers in the sprayed areas result from the <b>immatures</b> leaving the areas where the food supple has been diminished (presumably due to insecticide applications) to forage in areas of more abundant food supply. In view of the higher predicted than observed abundances at the sprayed areas for the adults and for the <b>immatures</b> of several species it is also probable that there was a depressed success rate in the sprayed areas. ...|$|R
