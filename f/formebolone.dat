50|$|<b>Formebolone</b> (INN, BAN) (brand names Esiclene, Hubernol, Metanor), {{also known}} (confusingly) as formyldienolone, {{as well as}} 2-formyl-11α-hydroxy-17α-methyl-δ1-testosterone, is an orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) {{described}} as an anticatabolic and anabolic drug that is or has been marketed in Spain and Italy. As an AAS, it shows some anabolic activity, though it is inferior to testosterone in terms of potency, but {{is said to have}} virtually no androgenic activity. <b>Formebolone</b> counteracts the catabolic effects (control of nitrogen balance) of potent glucocorticoids like dexamethasone phosphate. A close analogue, roxibolone (and its long-acting ester variant decylroxibolone), shows similar antiglucocorticoid activity to <b>formebolone</b> but, in contrast, is devoid of activity as an AAS.|$|E
50|$|Roxibolone {{has been}} found not to bind to the {{glucocorticoid}} receptor, {{and it has been}} suggested that the antiglucocorticoid activity of roxibolone and <b>formebolone</b> may instead be mediated by modulation of enzymatic processes. Indeed, 11α- and 11β-hydroxyprogesterone (<b>formebolone</b> and roxibolone being 11α- and 11β-hydroxylated (respectively) similarly) are known to be potent inhibitors of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD), which is responsible for the biosynthesis of the potent endogenous glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone (from the precursors deoxycortisol and deoxycorticosterone, respectively). However, <b>formebolone</b> was found to be a very weak inhibitor of 11β-HSD type 2 (IC50 > 10 μM), although this specific isoenzyme of 11β-HSD is responsible for the inactivation of glucocorticoids rather than their production.|$|E
50|$|Unlike <b>formebolone,</b> {{which is}} {{additionally}} an anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS), roxibolone is devoid of {{affinity for the}} androgen receptor and possesses no androgenic or myotrophic activity in animal assays. For this reason, {{it has been said}} that roxibolone may be much better tolerated in comparison.|$|E
50|$|Roxibolone (INN) (developmental {{code name}} BR-906), {{also known as}} 11β,17β-dihydroxy-17α-methyl-3-oxoandrosta-1,4-diene-2-carboxylic acid, is a steroidal antiglucocorticoid {{described}} as an anticholesterolemic (cholesterol-lowering) and anabolic drug which was never marketed. Roxibolone {{is closely related to}} <b>formebolone,</b> which shows antiglucocorticoid activity similarly and, with the exception of having a carboxaldehyde group at the C2 position instead of a carboxylic acid group, roxibolone is structurally almost identical to. The 2- ester of roxibolone, decylroxibolone (developmental code name BR-917), is a long-acting prodrug of roxibolone with similar activity.|$|E
50|$|In rats, {{roxibolone}} counteracts the catabolic effects (control {{of nitrogen}} balance) and increased alkaline phosphatase levels {{induced by the}} potent glucocorticoid dexamethasone phosphate. It does not bind to the glucocorticoid receptor however, and its antiglucocorticoid activity may instead be mediated by enzyme inhibition. In accordance, 11α- and 11β-hydroxyprogesterone {{are known to be}} potent inhibitors of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD), which is responsible for the biosynthesis of the potent endogenous glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone (from the precursors deoxycortisol and deoxycorticosterone, respectively). As roxibolone is 11β-hydroxylated similarly, it may act in a likewise fashion. However, <b>formebolone</b> was found to be a very weak inhibitor of 11β-HSD type 2, although this specific isoenzyme is responsible for the inactivation of glucocorticoids rather than their production.|$|E
40|$|The {{anabolic}} {{effect of}} <b>Formebolone</b> on {{the retention of}} nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium in adult male volunteers was evaluated {{over a period of}} 21 days. The study was divided into a prc-dosc period to establish baseline data, a period where the drug was given daily followed by a third period after treat ment had ceased to investigate whether the effects were in any way prolonged. <b>Formebolone</b> was wed tolerated and showed a positive effect on nitrogen balance and bodyweight change in all subjects. The effects on calcium and phosphorus balance were less clear-cut but indicated increased retention of both elements. I n t r o d u c t i o n The object {{of the study was to}} determine whether the effects of <b>Formebolone,</b> a new anabolic steroid, on nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus balance, could be demonstrated on male volunteers whose food intake was controlled only by detailed diet charts, under normal living and working conditions. The synthetic steroid is chemically...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolism}} {{of several}} anabolic 17 $ alpha$-methyl steroids, namely <b>formebolone,</b> mestanolone, methandienone, methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone and stanozolol, were investigated. The identification of metabolites {{was based on}} GC/MS analysis of different derivatives, and chemical synthesis of corresponding reference steroids. Common metabolic reactions have been studied and structure-metabolism relationships were discussed. New biotransformation routes, such as oxidative pathways of 2 -formyl and 2 -hydroxymethylene steroids, have been unveiled. The mechanism of 17 -epimerization of these 17 $ beta$-hydroxy- 17 $ alpha$-methyl steroids in vivo has also been clarified. A simple and convenient method for the preparation of 17 $ beta$-tertiary sulfate derivatives of these steroids has been developed. A stereoselective approach {{was used for the}} partial synthesis of reference steroids in order to confirm the stereochemical features of an acidic metabolite of oxymetholone...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} is described for the simultaneous determination of androgenic substances including steroids and beta 2 -agonists. The method involves analysis of hydrolized urinary anabolic compounds using liquid-liquid extraction, with subsequent conversion to trimethylsilylether derivatives {{for the analysis}} by GC-MS. Pulse split injection 1 / 10 of the TMS derivatives at 280 °C into the capillary column, initially maintained at 140 °C then programmed to 180 °C at 40 °C min- 1, followed by 3 ºC min- 1 to 230 ºC and then 40 ºC min- 1 to 300 ºC, resulted in good resolution and peak shape for all compounds. The detection limits {{of most of the}} steroids were 1 ng mL- 1 except for <b>formebolone</b> and trenbolone (25 ng mL- 1). When applied to selected urine samples with evidence of bacterial degradation and metabolites from usual medications/vitamins, the method allowed rapid screening for androgens and other substances monitored in routine. The resolution was adequate to evaluate the endogenous steroid profile relevant to doping control and medical applications...|$|E
40|$|Triple {{quadrupole}} (QqQ), time {{of flight}} (TOF) and quadrupole-{{time of flight}} (QTOF) analysers have been compared {{for the detection of}} anabolic steroids in human urine. Ten anabolic steroids were selected as model compounds based on their ionization and the presence of endogenous interferences. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses were evaluated. QqQ allowed for the detection of all analytes at the minimum required performance limit (MRPL) established by the World Anti-Doping Agency (between 2 and 10  ng mL− 1 in urine). TOF and QTOF approaches were not sensitive enough to detect some of the analytes (3 ′-hydroxy-stanozolol or the metabolites of boldenone and <b>formebolone)</b> at the established MRPL. Although a suitable accuracy was obtained, the precision was unsatisfactory (RSD typically higher than 20 %) for quantitative purposes irrespective of the analyser used. The methods were applied to 30 real samples declared positives either for the misuse of boldenone, stanozolol and/or methandienone. Most of the compounds were detected by every technique, however QqQ was necessary for the detection of some metabolites in a few samples. Finally, the possibility to detect non-target steroids has been explored by the use of TOF and QTOF. The use of this approach revealed that the presence of boldenone and its metabolite in one sample was due to the intake of androsta- 1, 4, 6 -triene- 3, 17 -dione. Additionally, the intake of methandienone was confirmed by the post-target detection of a long-term metabolite...|$|E
