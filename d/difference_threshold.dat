40|$|When {{seeking to}} reduce {{vibration}} in transport {{it is useful}} to know how much reduction is needed for the improvement to be noticeable. This experimental study investigated whether relative <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the perception of whole-body vertical vibration by seated persons depend on the frequency or magnitude of vibration. Relative <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> for sinusoidal seat vibration were determined for 12 males at three vibration magnitudes and eight frequencies (2. 5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 315 Hz) using the three-down-one-up method in conjunction with a two-interval-forced-choice procedure. The median relative <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> were in the range 9. 5 % to 20. 3 %. There appeared to be a frequency-dependence at the lowest vibration magnitude, such that higher frequencies had higher <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds.</b> The relative <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> depended on the vibration magnitude only at 2. 5 and 315 Hz.

40|$|<b>Difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> for seated {{subjects}} {{exposed to}} whole-body vertical sinusoidal vibration have been determined at two vibration magnitudes [0. 1 and 0. 5 ms– 2 {{root mean square}} (r. m. s.) ] and at two frequencies (5 and 20 Hz). For 12 subjects, <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> were determined using the up-and-down transformed response method based on two-interval forced-choice tracking.

40|$|It has {{not been}} {{established}} whether the smallest perceptible change in the intensity of vibrotactile stimuli depends on the somatosensory channel mediating the sensation. This study investigated intensity <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> for vibration using contact conditions (different frequencies, magnitudes, contact areas, body locations) selected so that perception would be mediated {{by more than one}} psychophysical channel. It was hypothesized that <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> mediated by the non-Pacinian I (NPI) channel and the Pacinian (P) channel would differ. Using two different contactors (1 -mm diameter contactor with 1 -mm gap to a fixed surround; 10 -mm diameter contactor with 2 -mm gap to the surround) vibration was applied to the thenar eminence and the volar forearm at two frequencies (10 and 125 ?Hz). The up-down-transformed-response method with a three-down-one-up rule provided absolute <b>thresholds</b> and also <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> at various levels above the absolute thresholds of 12 subjects (i. e., sensation levels, SLs) selected to activate preferentially either single channels or multiple channels. Median <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> varied from 0. 20 (thenar eminence with 125 -Hz vibration at 10 ?dB SL) to 0. 58 (thenar eminence with 10 -Hz vibration at 20 ?dB SL). Median <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> tended to be lower for the P channel than the NPI channel. The NPII channel may have reduced <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> with the smaller contactor at 125 ?Hz. It is concluded that there are large and systematic variations in <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> associated with the frequency, the magnitude, the area of contact, and the location of contact with vibrotactile stimuli that cannot be explained without increased understanding of the perception of supra-threshold vibrotactile stimuli. <br/...|$|R

5000|$|A {{threshold}} (or limen) is {{the point}} of intensity at which the participant can just detect the presence of a stimulus (absolute threshold) or the presence of a difference between two stimuli (<b>difference</b> <b>threshold).</b> Stimuli with intensities below the threshold are considered not detectable (hence: sub-liminal).

50|$|In {{neuroscience}} and psychophysics, {{an absolute}} threshold was originally {{defined as the}} lowest level of a stimulus - light, sound, touch, etc. - that an organism could detect. Under the influence of signal detection theory, absolute threshold has been redefined as the level at which a stimulus will be detected a specified percentage (often 50%) of the time. The absolute threshold can be influenced by several different factors, such as the subject's motivations and expectations, cognitive processes, and whether the subject is adapted to the stimulus.The absolute threshold can be compared to the <b>difference</b> <b>threshold,</b> which is the measure of how different two stimuli must be for the subject to notice that they are not the same.|$|E

50|$|A <b>difference</b> <b>threshold</b> (or just-noticeable difference, JND) is the {{magnitude}} of the smallest difference between two stimuli of differing intensities that the participant is able to detect some proportion of the time (the percentage depending on the kind of task). To test this threshold, several different methods are used. The subject may be asked to adjust one stimulus until it is perceived as the same as the other (method of adjustment), may be asked to describe the direction and magnitude of the difference between two stimuli, or may be asked to decide whether intensities in a pair of stimuli are the same or not (forced choice). The just-noticeable difference (JND) is not a fixed quantity; rather, it depends on how intense the stimuli being measured are and the particular sense being measured. Weber's Law states that the just-noticeable difference of a stimulus is a constant proportion despite variation in intensity.|$|E

40|$|The goal of biclustering in a gene {{expression}} data matrix {{is to find}} a submatrix such that the genes in the submatrix show highly correlated activities across all conditions in the submatrix. A measure called Mean Squared Residue (MSR) is used to simultaneously evaluate the coherence of rows and columns within a submatrix. In this paper a new method for biclustering {{gene expression}} data is developed. In the first step high quality bicluster seeds are generated using K-Means clustering algorithm. Then more genes and conditions (node) are added to the bicluster. Before adding a node the MSR X of the bicluster is calculated. After adding the node again the MSR Y is calculated. The added node is deleted if Y minus X is greater than MSR <b>difference</b> <b>threshold</b> or if Y is greater than δ (MSR threshold) which depends on the dataset. The MSR <b>difference</b> <b>threshold</b> is different for gene list and condition list and it depends on the dataset also. Proper values should be identified through experimentation in order to obtain biclusters of large size. Since {{it is very difficult to}} calculate the value of MSR <b>difference</b> <b>threshold,</b> in this algorithm an iterative search is used where MSR <b>difference</b> <b>threshold</b> is initialized with a small value and it is incremented after each iteration. A bicluster is obtained from Yeast dataset with a unique structural appearance.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of color contrast on luminance discrimination. Observers were required to indicate the more intense of two stimuli presented briefly in a surround. In some conditions the two stimuli were the same chromaticity as the surround, while in other conditions the stimuli differed in chromaticity from the surround. The luminance of the fixed test stimulus was varied in different conditions over a range from below the surround level to above the surround level. <b>Difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> were proportional to the luminance difference between test and surround over much of the range. However, <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> were higher at low luminance contrasts when the chromatic contrast between the stimuli and the surround was high. Results also indicate that the effects of chromatic contrast may be mediated by local contrast mechanisms, but that the relationship between threshold and luminance contrast is not mediated entirely by these local contrast mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Reductions in vehicle {{vibration}} {{that may}} contribute to improvements in overall vehicle ride could individually be {{too small to be}} detected by drivers or passengers. This study investigated the ‘difference threshold’ (the difference in magnitude between two stimuli which is just sufficient for their difference to be detected) required for a change in vehicle ride to be perceived and whether this was consistent with Weber's Law. Ten male and 10 female subjects sat in a car seat and were exposed to four different reproductions of the vertical vibration recorded on the seat of a car. Three of the stimuli had the same waveform recorded while the car traversed a tarmac surface. This waveform was reproduced using three different magnitudes of vibration at the seat: 0. 2, 0. 4 and 0. 8 m s? 2 r. m. s. (Wb weighted). The other stimulus was recorded with the car traversing a ‘pavé’ surface that gave a different waveform that was reproduced at a magnitude of 0. 4 m s? 2 r. m. s. (Wb weighted). There were significant differences in the absolute <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> measured using the same waveform at the three different magnitudes. When the <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> were expressed in relative terms (the proportion by which two stimuli must differ in magnitude to be discriminated), the relative <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> were approximately 13 %, and independent of both the vibration magnitude and the vibration waveform. The results are therefore consistent with Weber's Law. No consistent differences were observed between the responses of male and female subjects...|$|R

The study evaluated whether increases in age affect older observers’ ability to learn, retain, and utilize effective implicit visual standards. Overall, the observers’ length <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> were 5. 85 % of the standard when the method of constant stimuli was used and improved to 4. 39 % of the standard for the method of single stimuli (a decrease of 25 %).
