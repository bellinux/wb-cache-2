25|$|The year HUAC began {{investigating}} <b>Hollywood</b> <b>is</b> {{often considered}} {{the beginning of}} the Cold War, as in March 1947, the Truman Doctrine was announced.

25|$|In Marcella Althaus-Reid's Liberation Theology and Sexuality, Marlene Dietrich, who is {{considered}} to be the first German-born actress to receive critical acclaim in <b>Hollywood,</b> <b>is</b> a model of liberation and subversion, as well as beauty, perfection and sensuality. In Rio de Janeiro, Althaus-Reid discovered a statue of Dietrich dressed as Our Lady of Aparecida in a gay bar in Copacabana beach. The image of Dietrich as the black Virgin Mary represents her overcoming duality. According to Althaus-Reid, it is a figure that sanctifies Dietrich while simultaneously liberating Mary.|$|E
25|$|Back on Broadway, Arthur {{continued}} {{to appear in}} small plays that received little attention. Critics, however, {{continued to}} praise her in their reviews. It {{has been argued that}} in this period, Arthur developed confidence in her acting craft for the first time. On the contrast between films in Hollywood and plays in New York, Arthur commented:I don't think <b>Hollywood</b> <b>is</b> the place to be yourself. The individual ought to find herself before coming to Hollywood. On the stage I found myself to be in a different world. The individual counted. The director encouraged me and I learned how to be myself.... I learned to face audiences and to forget them. To see the footlights and not to see them; to gauge the reactions of hundreds of people, and yet to throw myself so completely into a role that I was oblivious to their reaction.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese {{animation}} {{industry and}} access to the latest technology, such as 3D computer-generated imagery technology, is actively supported by the Chinese government and included in the latest national planning. In part this may be because of a desire to increase Chinese soft power. The same technology as in <b>Hollywood</b> <b>is</b> available and much postproduction is outsourced to China. Successful indigenous artistic creativity is seen as a problem and may be restricted by factors such as production being aimed at getting government patronage rather than public approval, censorship, and some story lines based on Chinese culture not appealing to foreign audiences. DreamWorks Animation, in a joint venture with Chinese companies, will set up a studio in Shanghai that may eventually get bigger than DreamWorks HQ, in part to avoid to quota restrictions on foreign films with China within a decade having been predicted to become the world's biggest cinema and entertainment market. Disney has also entered into a partnership in order to help develop the Chinese animation industry.|$|E

In his opening statement, Lynn described Hollywood as [...] "a ruthless coward."

500|$|Green has {{expressed}} interest in returning to the theatre.

500|$|At {{the same}} time, the Coens {{stress that the}} {{labyrinth}} of deception and difficulty Barton endures {{is not based on}} their own experience. Although Joel has said that artists tend to [...] "meet up with Philistines", he added: [...] "Barton Fink is quite far from our own experience. Our professional life in Hollywood has been especially easy, and this is no doubt extraordinary and unfair". Ethan has suggested that Lipnick– like the men on which he is based– is in some ways a product of his time. [...] "I don't know that that kind of character exists anymore. <b>Hollywood</b> <b>is</b> a little more bland and corporate than that now".|$|E

He evades his captors and reaches the seashore, where he prays for deliverance and at last meets the angelic figure of Greta Garbo, who guides him [...] "home to somewhere monochrome, but somewhere {{you will be a}} certain kind of free". A circular plot device concludes and resolves the fantasy.|$|E

500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times {{said the}} film carried a more {{philosophical}} {{portrait of the}} science fiction genre than did other films, but still managed [...] "to satisfy the cravings {{of the general public}} who simply want to be entertained". Internet reviewer James Berardinelli said Contact is [...] "one of 1997's finest motion pictures, and is a forceful reminder that <b>Hollywood</b> <b>is</b> still capable of making magic." [...] Berardinelli felt the film was on par with Stanley Kubrick's [...] (1968) {{to be one of the}} greatest science fiction films ever made. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle largely enjoyed the first 90 minutes of Contact but felt that director Robert Zemeckis was too obsessed with visual effects rather than cohesive storytelling for the pivotal climax.|$|E
500|$|Roswell {{returned}} to The Simpsons in 2002 {{in the season}} premiere of the fourteenth season, in which Maude made an appearance as a ghost.

She also appeared as Helen Lovejoy in the 2007 film The Simpsons Movie. She attended the gala premiere together with her daughter, Spenser Rayle, who was fourteen {{years old at the}} time.

[...] Chicago Tribune columnist Steve Johnson commented, [...] "Billy Crystal returned as host of the Academy Awards on Monday night and proved that even if mainline <b>Hollywood</b> <b>is</b> nearly shut out in the trophy dispensing, one of its representatives can at least make a television broadcast entertaining." [...] Television critic Kinney Littlefield of the Orange County Register quipped, [...] "In his fifth stint as host, Crystal served up the sense of inclusive, insider movie community that had been missing during his three-year absence." [...] In addition, she observed, [...] "For most of the evening, Oscar seemed newly energized, upbeat and full of splashy fun." ...|$|E
