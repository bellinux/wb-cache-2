25|$|In addition, {{the number}} of {{employers}} who offer health insurance has declined and costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising: from 2001 to 2007, premiums for family coverage increased 78%, while wages rose 19% and prices rose 17%, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Even {{for those who are}} employed, the private insurance in the US varies greatly in its coverage; one study by the Commonwealth Fund published in Health Affairs estimated that 16 million U.S. adults were underinsured in 2003. The underinsured were significantly more likely than those with adequate insurance to forgo health care, report financial stress because of medical bills, and experience coverage gaps for such items as prescription drugs. The study found that underinsurance disproportionately affects those with lower incomes—73% of the underinsured in the study population had annual incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level.

25|$|Concerning {{the overall}} literacy, the sources allow us only a rough image. In total, only around 5% of all known written records of Christian Nubia {{come from the}} domains of Alodia. The thought of Ochala, that {{northern}} Nubia produced more sources mostly because of its proximity to Egypt should be rejected, not only because, as he also says, the north is way more studied than the south, {{but also because of}} the fact that Alodia housed the very heartland of the former Meroitic kingdom, a kingdom which was considerable literate. It seems plausible to suggest that like in other Medieval societies, the art of reading and writing was taught by the clerics to nobles and officials, but would the average population have had basic writing skills as well. In the case of Alodia, the latter can be attested by two types of sources: First, ostraca and other incised pottery as well as a few incised bricks predominantly coming from Soba and second, graffiti incised into former Meroitic monuments and sites. The graffiti from Meroitic sites have hitherto been largely ignored by scholars and therefore comprise only a fraction of all known written sources, but <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>in</b> preparation now. Content-wise, all known inscriptions consist of personal names, names of saints (Often in the form of monograms) and short, predominantly religious, sentences. Except of graffiti, the Alodians also used to write books, which they did, according to the Fung Chronichle, in Greek, but commentated upon them in Nubian.|$|E

500|$|Creangă's {{contribution}} to literature also covers {{a series of}} didactic fables written as lively dialogues, among them [...] "The Needle and the Sledge Hammer", in which the objects of traditional metalworking scold the byproducts of their work for having forgotten their lowly origin. The inspiration behind this theme was identified by Călinescu as [...] "The Story of a Gold Coin", written earlier by Creangă's Junimist colleague Vasile Alecsandri. A similar piece, [...] "The Flax and the Shirt", reveals the circuit of fibers from weed-like plants into recycled cloth, leading {{to the conclusion that}} [...] "all things are not what they seem; they were something else once, they are something else now;—and shall become something else." [...] The technique employed by Creangă has the flax plant teaching the less knowledgeable textile, a dialogue which Călinescu likened to that between old women in a traditional society. Included alongside the two stories were: Pâcală, a writing which, Mircea Braga argued, is not as much didactic as it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>in</b> dialogue; [...] "The Bear Tricked by the Fox", which uses legendary and humorous elements in an attempt to explain why bears are the tail-less species among mammals; and Cinci pâini ("Five Loafs of Bread"), which serves as a condemnation of greed.|$|E

500|$|Steve Giergerich of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch {{felt that}} Sarah and Little Bee are both [...] "so richly drawn that the {{supporting}} characters suffer by comparison." [...] These supporting characters are Andrew, Sarah's husband, Lawrence, her lover, Clarissa her colleague and Charlie, her four-year-old son, who {{for much of}} the novel answers only to [...] "Batman" [...] and dresses only in his Batman costume. Sarah Liss of CBC News deemed Andrew and Lawrence the two least-likeable characters in the novel, describing Andrew as [...] "an ordinary guy with self-righteous beliefs who comes up slightly short when he's tested by real life" [...] and Lawrence as a [...] "cowardly yes-man". Cleave agreed that for Lawrence, [...] "career and propriety are more important than basic morality. He's gone so far down that road that he can't come back, and he's made more villainous for all the things he could do but doesn't." [...] Charlie is based on Cleave's oldest son, who similarly spent six months aged four answering only to [...] "Batman". He forms the emotional centre of the novel, holding the adult characters together, and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>in</b> the early formation of identity. Cleave explained: [...] "Little Bee is a novel about where our individuality lies – which layers of identity are us, and which are mere camouflage. So it's a deliberate choice to use the metaphor of a child who is engaging in his first experiments with identity – in Charlie's case by taking on the persona of a superhero." ...|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} widespread acclaim. Kate Stables {{wrote in}} Sight & Sound: [...] "Elegant restraint is the film’s watchword ... In this enjoyably deliberate film, each shot and scene is carefully composed {{to pay homage}} to 50s cinema, yet infused with an emotional ambiguity which feels decidedly contemporary." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said: [...] " [...] has made a serious melodrama about the geometry of desire, a dreamy example of heightened reality that fully engages emotions despite the exact calculations with which it's been made... 'Carol's' lush but controlled visual look is completely intoxicating. This is filmmaking done by masters, an experience to savor." [...] A.O. Scott wrote in The New York Times: [...] "At once ardent and analytical, cerebral and swooning, 'Carol' <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>in</b> human magnetism, in the physics and optics of eros. With sparse dialogue and restrained drama, the film is a symphony of angles and glances, of colors and shadows." [...] Amy Taubin from Film Comment said: [...] "The narrative, precisely chiseled by Phyllis Nagy from the ungainly novel, is deceptively simple ... What's remarkable about Carol is that it seems to exist entirely in the present moment—to be precise, in that electric, elastic, heart-stopping/heart-racing present of romantic desire. It is a film composed of gestures and glances, its delicacy a veiled promise of abandon. And it could not exist without the extraordinary performances of Blanchett and Mara." [...] David Stratton of The Australian wrote: [...] "The meeting of these two women is an electrifying scene; their eyes make contact, and nothing of significance is said, apart from the usual interaction between shopper and shop assistant, but Haynes and his wonderful actors make it very clear that something momentous has occurred — love at first sight." ...|$|E

The result was the character of Frank Grimes, a man who has had to work hard all his life with nothing to show for it and is dismayed and embittered by Homer's success and comfort in spite of his inherent laziness and ignorance. [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; in some scenes, his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted.

I know this episode is controversial and divisive, but I just love it. It really feels like what would happen if a real, somewhat humorless human had to deal with Homer.

On the DVD commentary, Weinstein considers this episode one of the most controversial of the seasons he ran, as it involves sharp observational humor which many fans [...] "didn't get."

He in part refuted the ideas of Jan Kott concerning the sexuality of Oberon and the fairies. He pointed that Oberon may be bisexual and his desire for the changeling boy may be sexual in nature, as Kott suggested. But there is little textual evidence to support this, as the writer left ambiguous clues concerning the idea of love among the fairies. He concluded that therefore their love life is [...] "unknowable and incomprehensible". According to Bevington, the main theme of the play is the conflict between sexual desire and rational restraint, an essential tension reflected throughout the play. It is the tension between the dark and benevolent sides of love, which are reconciled in the end.|$|E
