40|$|The {{chemical}} properties of calcium phosphate cements (CPCs) {{are very similar}} to the mineral phase of bone. CPCs are, consequently, very effective substrates (scaffolds) for tissue engineering; bone and stem cells attach readily, and can proliferate and differentiate to form new bone tissue. Unlike other CPCs that may remain largely unchanged in the body for years, such as hydroxyapatite, <b>dicalcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> are remodelled by the body and rapidly converted to new bone. Unfortunately, the <b>dicalcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> are also typically too weak to support load bearing in the human body. Our laboratory has recently developed a novel, high strength brushite CPC, (hsCPC), which can reach 10 - 50 fold higher failure strength than many commercially available CPCs. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the physical, chemical and biological performance of hsCPCs in physiologically relevant model of drug release, load bearing, osteoconductivity, and as a scaffold for bone tissue engineering. Multiple CPCs were compared in a model of screw augmentation to determine whether the physical properties of the cement, such as bulk strength and porosity, affected orthopedic screw holding strength. In an in vitro model of bone regeneration stem cells were grown on macroporous scaffolds that were fabricated from hsCPC. Drug releasing scaffolds were fabricated to examine whether the low porosity of hsCPC impeded drug release during a 4 week incubation period. The biological activity of an incorporated drug, Rebamipide, was examined after acute and chronic incubation periods. In the drug release study it was noted that the biological response to hsCPC was significantly better than tissue culture grade polystyrene, even in groups without drug. The mechanism underlying this biological response was further investigated by testing the effect of pyrophosphate, a common cement additive, on bone cell proliferation and differentiation. This thesis concludes that a high strength cement can produce significant improvement in screw augmentation strength, if there is sufficient cortical bone near the augmentation site. The hsCPC is also cytocompatible, and can support bone and stem cell proliferation and differentiation. hsCPC scaffolds stimulated osteogenic gene expression comparable to native bone scaffolds. hsCPC scaffolds are also capable of delivering drug for up to 4 weeks, in vitro. Finally, a cement additive, pyrophosphate, stimulated differentiation, but not proliferation of bone cells...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} project compares different chemical and spectroscopic techniques aimed at finding {{a quick and}} cheap replacement for the measurement of digestibility of phosphorus (P) in different inorganic feed additives for pigs. This research yielded {{a comparison of the}} digestibility of different feed additives. P digestibility was determined from in vivo studies of pigs. The animal feed in the in vivo studies contained P levels below the nutrient requirements. The basal diet was a corn soybean meal base. Assessment was performed on 6 different inorganic P sources, rock phosphate (tricalcium phosphate (TCP)), meat and bone meal (MBM), mono/dicalcium phosphate (MDCP) and three different <b>dicalcium</b> <b>phosphates</b> (DCPs). Eight pigs where selected and placed into separate pens. Two were given basal diets and the other 6 diets were randomly selected and supplied with the different inorganic P sources. P digestibility was calculated by difference. The apparent P digestibility of the sources were: TCP at 46 %, the MBM at 85 %, MDCP at 71 % and three DCPs ranged from 49 % to 73 %. This substantiated that the apparent P digestibility in the major inorganic sources of P is significantly less than 100 %. The in vitro or chemical methods of assessing phosphorus availability in animal feed included the commonly used feed extraction methods of water solubility and 2 % citric acid. These two methods showed significant differences between each other. Other chemical methods used included calcium chloride, ammonium acetate, sodium bicarbonate extractions, and a double extraction using hydrochloric acid (HCl) followed by sodium bicarbonate. The chemical methods showed non-significant correlation coefficients when compared to in vivo P digestibility of the six phosphate ingredients used. Infra-red spectroscopy is now commonly used in feed production for many other nutritional tests. NIR, although being able to obtain an R 2 above 0. 999 for correlation curves and factor prediction curves, could not obtain a self prediction of the calcium phosphates due to the large Mahalanobis Distance. P digestibility predicted by MIR showed close agreement with the in vivo P digestibility. Again due to the small number of ingredients tested in the pig trial, the prediction of digestibility using MIR could only be compared to it self. Hence MIR can only be used as an estimate until more data can be obtained. The P 31 SS-MAS-NMR indicated one of the DCPs was made up of 3 or more P compounds by displaying 3 major peaks. All the P chemical shifts from the faeces had different positions to the P peaks in the ingredients, indicating some sort of change in the P form. Overall the chemical methods were unable to predict P digestibility, and while the spectroscopic techniques showed promise, they still require more work to examine many more feed additives.

Varying amounts of type I collagen were added during {{the preparation of the}} DCP-rich CPC. In vitro cell adhesion, morphology, viability, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were evaluated using progenitor bone cells. Bone graft performance was evaluated via a rat posterolateral lumbar fusion model and osteointegration of the implant. New bone formations in the restorative sites were assessed by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histological analysis. We found that the incorporation of collagen into the DCP-rich CPC was associated with increased cell adhesion, cell viability, and ALP activity in vitro. The spinal fusion model revealed a significant increase in bone regeneration. Additionally, better osseointegration was observed between the host bone and graft with the DCP-rich CPC supplemented with collagen than with the collagen-free DCP-rich CPC control graft. Furthermore, compared to the control graft, the results of micro-CT showed that a smaller amount of residual material was observed with the collagen-containing DCP-rich CPC graft compared with the control graft, which suggests the collagen supplement enhanced new bone formation. Of the different mixtures evaluated in this study (0. 8 g DCP-rich CPC supplemented with 0. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 4 mL type I collagen, respectively), DCP-rich CPC supplemented with 0. 4 mL collagen led to the highest level of osteogenesis.

Significant differences were observed among the 4 methods employed for reducing dentin permeability (p < 0. 001) and the 3 post-treatment times (p < 0. 001). VLA and VAN never achieved 50 % permeability reductions consistently in any of the 3 time periods. Only the calcium phosphate-based desensitizer applied for 3 times consistently reduced dentin permeability by 50 % after 24 h. When applied once, the permeability reduction of TM increased progressively over the 3 time periods. After 7 days, only one and three applications of the calcium phosphate-based desensitizer consistently reduced dentin permeability by more than 50 %. Permeability reductions corresponded well with scanning electron microscopy examination of dentinal tubule orifice occlusion in dentin specimens treated with the agents. Overall, the dicalcium and tetracalcium phosphate-based desensitizer is effective in reducing dentin permeability via a tubule occlusion mechanism. The ability of the agent to reduce dentin permeability renders it to be potentially useful as a clinical dentin desensitizing agent, which has to be confirmed in future clinical studies. By contrast, the two sodium fluoride varnishes are not effective in dentin permeability reduction and should be considered as topical fluoride delivering agents rather than tubular orifice-blocking agents...|$|R

Diluent type was found to influence the flow properties of the mixtures, with <b>dicalcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> giving predictable results while mixtures containing lactose were anomalous with respect to flow. The characterization of the packing and cohesive properties of the binary mixtures of chloroquine with lactose and <b>dicalcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> would be useful in the production of powders, tablets, capsules and other drug delivery systems containing these powders with desirable and predictable flow properties...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dicalcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> {{anhydrous}} (DCPA) powder was synthesized in {{the size}} range between 200 - 750 nm using calcium carbonate and phosphoric acid in ethanol solution. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the synthesized powder showed monetite as the major phase with some unreacted calcium carbonate as secondary phase. After 2 hrs of stirring on reaction mixture in ethanol 3 Wt% of each chitosan, poly ethylene oxide, <b>dicalcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> anhydrous was used for fabricating electrospun fibrous scaffold for bone tissue engineering. Glacial acetic acidcounts to be a suitable solvent for electrospining the suspension. The fabricated electrospun scaffold was characterized using X-ray diffraction and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy. Both X-ray diffraction and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy confirm the presence of chitosan, <b>dicalcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> and hydroxyapatite as major phases in the scaffold. Nanofibre morphology of the scaffold with average fiber diameter varying between 61 nm to 703 nm was observed from scanning electron micrograph of the electrospun scaffold...|$|E
