2500|$|George H. W. Bush {{employed}} the word [...] "liberal" [...] as a derogatory epithet during his 1988 presidential campaign. Bush {{described himself as}} a patriot, and described his liberal opponents as unpatriotic. He referred to liberalism as [...] "the L-word" [...] and sought to demonize opposing presidential candidate Michael Dukakis by labeling Dukakis [...] "the liberal governor" [...] and by pigeonholing him as part of what Bush called [...] "the L-crowd". Bush recognized that motivating voters to fear Dukakis as a risky, non-mainstream candidate generated political support for his own campaign. Bush's campaign also used issues of prayer to arouse suspicions that Dukakis was less devout in his religious convictions. Bush's running mate, vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle said to Christians at the 1988 Republican National Convention [...] "It's always <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> people who are real Americans". Bill Clinton avoided association with [...] "liberal" [...] as a political label during his 1992 presidential campaign against George H.W. Bush by moving closer to the political center.|$|E

60|$|As for the women, {{they were}} the kindest, merriest, most {{agreeable}} he had as yet known. They were pleasanter than Parson Broadbent's black-eyed daughter at home, whose laugh carried {{as far as a}} gun. They were quite as well-bred as the Castlewood ladies, with the exception of Madam Beatrix (who, indeed, was as grand as an empress on some occasions). But somehow, after a talk with Madam Beatrix, and vast amusement and interest in her stories, the lad would come away as with a bitter taste in his mouth, and fancy all the world wicked round about him. They were not in the least squeamish; and laughed over pages of Mr. Fielding, and cried over volumes of Mr. Richardson, containing jokes and incidents which would make Mrs. Grundy's hair stand on end, yet their merry prattle left no bitterness behind it: their tales about this neighbour and that were droll, not malicious; the curtseys and salutations with which the folks of the little neighbouring town received them, how kindly and cheerful! their bounties how cordial! Of a truth it is <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> good people. How good Harry Warrington did not know at the time, perhaps, or until subsequent experience showed him contrasts, or caused him to feel remorse. Here was a tranquil, sunshiny day of a life that was to be agitated and stormy--a happy hour or two to remember. Not much happened during the happy hour or two. It was only sweet sleep, pleasant waking, friendly welcome, serene pastime. The gates of the old house seemed to shut the wicked world out somehow, and the inhabitants within to be better, and purer, and kinder than other people. He was not in love; oh no! not the least, either with saucy Hetty or generous Theodosia but when the time came for going away, he fastened on both their hands, and felt an immense regard for them. He thought he should like to know their brothers, and that they must be fine fellows; and as for Mrs. Lambert, I believe she was as sentimental at his departure {{as if he had been}} the last volume of Clarissa Harlowe.|$|E

50|$|Later it is {{discovered}} that Austin {{was having an}} affair with Summer's aunt Abby, leaving Summer heartbroken and confused as she is grieving for her husband and mad that he cheated on her. Kyle also has come back to town and revealed that he first came back to confront Austin about his affair with Abby leaving Summer angry that Kyle didn't first tell her. However, Summer forgives Kyle and he continues comforting her over her loss. Then the person who killed Austin begins threatening Summer, Kyle, Noah, Courtney, and Abby. As time goes by, they keep looking for the killer which causes the killer to strike again - this time killing Courtney on her wedding day before she was to marry Noah. This leaves Summer heartbroken as she has now lost her husband and best friend, and so Kyle remains by her side to help her in her grieving. Summer suspects Sharon as the killer, which causes a rift between her and Noah. Later, Summer attends a party with Kyle to get her mind off of everything. After the party at her house, Summer talks about Courtney then tells Kyle that she can't keep dragging Kyle into her misery but Kyle says that that's what he is here for and that they were family for a little while at least but Summer says she doesn't look at him and see a brother and Kyle says he's not and he never was. Summer looks at Kyle and says no you weren't. Kyle and Summer look deeply at each other and then kiss, which leads to them making love for the first time. Afterwards Summer tells Kyle that it feels so <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> him. They both also say it feels so natural being with each other even after they were told that it was unnatural. Summer says that it was unfair that they were kept apart because of Sharon's lie. Then Noah sees them and gets mad because Kyle took advantage of Summer. After Noah leaves Kyle tells Summer not to feel ashamed, that what they did isn't wrong and that Noah is just grieving. Later Summer and Noah make up and he apologizes. Sharon is arrested soon after as evidence points to her. Noah defends her but Summer continues to believe she is guilty.|$|E

Well, tomorrow’s payday, thank goodness. Darling, I love you. Gosh just as I wrote that they fired the cannon for retreat. That’s the kind of an ovation I like. You see,—you rate around here, beautiful. Steve won’t be able to make it this weekend, he’s not allowed to have anyone take over for him, so he’ll be too late. Anyway I don’t like double dates anymore, {{although}} when I’m with you I don’t know or care who’s around. When we’re together, honey, it’s like a dream, and you’re the only one in it. It’s just <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> you Dottie, and I never felt about any other girl that way. There always seemed to be an ulterior motive for my being with anyone else. With you it’s just that I love you, and I want to be near you. I know that no matter how long we’re together or apart it will always be that way—always. Tonight Steve and I and a bunch of the boys are going to the movies to see “Frenchman’s Creek. ” The band is going to play tonight too. It’s a swell outfit, they have Don Cornell, who used to be with Sammy Kaye, for a vocalist. He’s pretty good. I’m glad the pictures are ready. Where are you going to have the ones taken Thursday night? Friday I won’t get off until around five or later, the way things look now it will probably be later, for we might take that Cross Country to Williamsport that afternoon. I’ll get home as soon as possible, darling, and call you when I do. Lonnie must have died a horrible death, but it’s better that way, then [sic] being a prisoner of the Japanese. I don’t think I’d ever let them take me prisoner. You have no idea darling, what fanatics they are, they just don’t seem human, do they? That’s why it’s going to take a long time to beat them. But we will darling, and everything that it has cost us in blood, sweat, and tears will be worth it. Always remember that honey. What’s this surprise you have for me this weekend? Christmas isn’t here yet, angel. You’re so sweet, and I love you so much. Today I flew instruments for an hour and a quarter, then the ship began to ice up so we were forced back to the field. This weather is really bad now. It’s snowing up here. I feel that every flake that falls could mean another minute that we’re apart;—and we have so little time left. Just three weekends and Christmas, but we’re lucky we have that, I guess. Give my best to your family, honey. I love you more every day, my darling. All my love, Judd[Transcription ends...|$|E

If union goods are heterogeneous in labor intensity, the introduction of an active union in the domestic country causes only the least labor-intensive range of union <b>goods</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> produced there, <b>with</b> <b>goods</b> of greatest labor intensity produced abroad because of the relatively high cost of domestic union labor.

Why does everything have to happen to me! Honey, I’ve been writing letters to more people this morning telling them that we’re engaged. Oh, Bill still hasn’t received the letter because I got a letter from him yesterday 2 ̆ 6 I know he hasn’t or if he has he’s doing a darned good job of pretending he has[n’t]. I’m in bed now and will probably be here {{for the rest of the}} week. Darling—Jean Molberg just called me 2 ̆ 6 asked me if it were true. She was all excited 2 ̆ 6 couldn’t believe it. She said that she had just gotten a letter from Dudley Nash so I got his address in case you didn’t have it. I can’t remember whether you said you were writing him or not but here it is anyway. Dudley Nash, M. M. M. 3 /cU. S. S. L. C. I. (L 517) c/o Fleet Post OfficeNew York, New York If you haven’t written him, honey, try to right away if you want to tell him. Jean said she’d wait a few days before she wrote 2 ̆ 6 told him so that you’d have a chance to tell him first. I thought you’d probably like to write him 2 ̆ 6 be the first to tell him if you haven’t already. Well, honey, so long again. I love you very much. You’re the most wonderful person in the world and I love you more than anything or anyone that ever existed. You’re all I want in the world. I love you so. Monday Dearest Judson— Golly, honey, you wanted me to stay home from work to write you a real long letter. Well, I did stay home from work but it’s almost quarter after seven now and I haven’t written at all. Time just flew today. I don’t know where it went. Honestly, I had every intention of writing you a real huge letter but didn’t get around to it. Darling, I’ve been thinking about you all day, every second. I’ve never felt like this before. There were quite a few time[s] when I thought that I was in love but I know now that this is the first time I’ve ever been in love. I feel all shaky sometimes when I think about you. I still haven’t gotten over the way I felt Saturday and Friday night. Can’t understand it. Last night at about two I was lying in bed thinking of you 2 ̆ 6 listening to the radio. They played one song that is really swell—I’m not sure what the name of it was but it was something about “I hadn’t met you” or something like that. Maybe they’ll play it before I finish writing to you. Anyway, you’ve probably heard it. I can remember almost all the words except the title. Today Bobbie brought the picture up to the Standard Star and I phoned in the announcement. They’ll send it to the Daily August 2 ̆ 6 Grandmaw took another one to the Pelham Sun. They probably won’t be in the papers until Thursday or Friday. The telephone’s been wringing all night. Everyone’s been calling up to let us know how their hangovers are. Oh, after you left millions of people had come. It was quite a mad house. Honey, I was so lonesome. When you called up it was such a nice surprise, honey. Golly, it was good to hear your voice again. Everyone was telling me how cute you were 2 ̆ 6 how lucky I was 2 ̆ 6 how happy I looked 2 ̆ 6 how wonderful you were. Golly, hon, I wish you could have stayed. I wanted to be alone with you so much. Remember when we went upstairs just before you left. Daddy was looking all over the place for us—of all times for him to pick, honestly! So of course everyone knew where we were. That was almost so well planned, too. When I called up Ginny today to tell her that I wouldn’t be in for a few days, she was so nice. Said not to worry about work 2 ̆ 6 to be sure 2 ̆ 6 stay home until it was all better. I hope that by Wednesday I’ll be able to go again. It’s so annoying to have to lie in bed all day. Last night the darned ankle was all swollen again 2 ̆ 6 so I decided to be a good little girl 2 ̆ 6 stay home. I’m afraid that if I don’t keep entirely off it, that it won’t be healed by next weekend 2 ̆ 6 that would break my heart. If there’s any swelling at all, I won’t go to work so don’t worry, darling. I just remembered the name of that song—“I Didn’t Know About You. ” Have you heard it? It reminds me so much of you. You’ve changed me a lot, honey. Was thinking of that today. I’m so afraid that I’ll do something to hurt you, though. You’re so sweet and thoughtful. I love you so. Honey, I wish that I could tell you how much I love you. There just doesn’t seem to be any way to showing you how I feel or telling you how deeply I love you. You write the most wonderful letters, honey. I wish I could say the right thing all the time the way you do. Your letters are just like you and they always say just what I like to hear—(experience, no doubt). Today looked like a beautiful day. What I could see of it between the slats of my Venitian [sic] blinds. Did you go on the cross-country yet? Hope that the weather is nice all week and that they let you off for a long time Christmas. Honey, when do you find out how long they’re going to give you? If it’s not too long, darling, I’m going to take some time off from work. It’s a shame that my ankle couldn’t wait until after Christmas. Gee, I love you so. Everything seemed to change so suddenly, honey, Friday night. Before we seemed to be more or less kidding around all the time 2 ̆ 6 then all of a sudden, everything was different. It’s a good thing that it happened, I guess. It had to sooner or later. And I think that it’s a good thing in a way that you’re leaving on the 28 th. Have you heard anything about where they’ll send you? It would be marvelous if they sent you someplace where you could get home every weekend or kept you at Stewart for the rest of your training. Darling, we were so lucky to have so much time together but I’d still like to have more. I hope when you get your wings that you have a long, long leave so that we can be married 2 ̆ 6 together for as long as possible. You’ll get 15 weeks more training, honey, won’t you after you graduate? Woody is going to try to come over tonight. I hope she can because then I’ll be able to talk about how wonderful you are to her. How is Steve? If Woody doesn’t come over tonight, I’ll answer his letter. He’s a very nice fellow. Did Gini go up yesterday? They’re playing “Silver Wings in the Moonlight. ” That should be more popular with so many Air Corps fellows around. I meant to tell you—Mary Smith got tight last night. She could hardly walk but she was so funny. Carol had to practically carry her home. The worst part was that she was going to Jim’s house for dinner. That should have been something. Darling, I love you so. That seems to be the only thing I can think of to say. There should be some other way to say it but somehow that’s all I can think of. This week will probably go fast for me because I’ll be in bed most of it and if I do go to work it will be such a surprise when Saturday comes. Darling—what do you want for Christmas? I know one thing I’m giving you but it’s only a small thing 2 ̆ 6 just sorta something extra. You said you wanted a pen 2 ̆ 6 pencil set but not what kind. I don’t know anything about pen 2 ̆ 6 pencil sets so tell me more about what kind 2 ̆ 6 color 2 ̆ 6 everything! Tell me some more things because a pen 2 ̆ 6 pencil set is the most unromantic thing I can think of. It’s so practical, too. Honey, I think we’ll be so happy when we’re married. I know I won’t be completely happy until we are. Wonder if we’ll always hate crowds as much. Hon, it’s getting worse 2 ̆ 6 worse, as far as I’m concerned. I don’t even know anybody else exists when you’re around except that they occasionally interrupt 2 ̆ 6 bother us. I love you so, honey. I just want to be with you, honey, forever. What time will we have to start, darling, to get up to the air show in time? I’d love to see you fly but it will be nicer to have you with me during the show, you can be with me can’t you? I wish we were married now, darling 2 ̆ 6 there wasn’t a war 2 ̆ 6 we could be together. Did Steve get Woody’s letter yet? How does he feel? What’s going to happen if Gini invites herself up for next weekend? That would be cozy. Gee, honey, it sure was <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> you for a whole day. This was a wonderful weekend. Are you very tired, darling. I feel so much in love. You should feel pretty beat after carrying me around last weekend. Do you know that when you went down to the station everyone was watching you carry me. When I got back they all had something to say about how cute it was, and what good practice you were getting. All my relatives are crazy about you. They think you’re wonderful. When they say that one of my friends (boys anyway) is swell, that really means something. Frenchy thought I was very lucky. Boy, did he get tight! Everyone did. Charlotte, Muriel, Ronnie 2 ̆ 6 I were up in my bedroom listening to the radio because we were sober 2 ̆ 6 they were getting a little wild down stairs. I sure wish you could have been there, darling. It would have been so perfect. Golly, I was so surprised. In a way I was in such a daze that I just didn’t know what was going on. That’s love. Honey, I love you so. Much more than I did last weekend. Every weekend seems to be the same—I love you so much more than the weekend before last. This just can’t go on much longer darling. Well, honey, I’ll write again tomorrow. I love you very, very, much. You’re marvelous—I love you so. All my love—Dottie[Transcription ends...|$|E
