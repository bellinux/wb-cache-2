500|$|In 2004, {{she played}} the lead role of army wife Sandra Williams in Hum Kaun Hai?, a supernatural thriller. The film opened to a mixed {{critical}} reception, but Kapadia's performance received positive comments. Subhash K. Jha noted that she [...] "carries the film beyond where {{it would have been}} otherwise"; Rama Sharma of The Tribune wrote of her performance, [...] "Dimple lends all her charisma to help the script sail through dead ends. Whether she is scared or scolding children, she has a powerful presence." [...] 2005 saw Kapadia and Rishi Kapoor reunite as a lead couple for the third time after Bobby (1973) and Saagar (1985) in Pyaar Mein Twist. They starred as two middle-aged single parents who fall in love and later {{have to deal with the}} reaction of their children. The film generated mostly negative reviews, with several critics concurring that the chemistry between the lead pair is what makes the film watchable. In a two-star review, Khalid Mohamed called Kapadia [...] "a dream actress", but ultimately concluded, [...] "See this twisteroo <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>must,</b> only for the undiminished Kapoor-Kapadia chemistry." [...] Few people went to see the film; within two weeks it was declared a flop.|$|E
500|$|When gliders {{containing}} paratroopers began landing {{around and}} {{to the west of}} the airfield on 20 May, Andrew became cut off from several of his platoons and companies with some being overrun by the German forces. Unable to gauge how the situation was unfolding, his communications with Hargest back at brigade headquarters also became disjointed. Andrew stressed the seriousness of the situation to Hargest and requested reinforcements from the other battalions, which were more than holding their own. Hargest incorrectly advised that there were no available troops. This left Andrew with his own small platoon-size reserve, which was used in a failed counter-attack. Eventually, Andrew sought permission to withdraw from Point 107; Hargest replied [...] "Well, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>must,</b> you must." [...] Although well aware of the importance of Maleme Airfield to the defence of Crete, Hargest made no effort to dissuade Andrew or see the situation for himself. Despite the belated arrival of a reinforcing company of infantry sent by Hargest that evening, Andrew decided his position was not defensible in daylight and withdrew his units to join the other battalions of the brigade. The Germans took both the airfield and Point 107 early on the morning of 21 May. The capture of the airfield allowed German reinforcements to be landed directly on Crete and establish a strong foothold on their otherwise tenuous positions.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the early}} efforts led by the DePorres Club was the 1952–54 Omaha Bus Boycott.

[...] Focusing on ending the Omaha and Council Bluffs Street Railway Company's policy of not hiring black drivers, the boycott was successful.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "post-screamo" [...] {{has been}} used loosely to {{describe}} {{a wide variety of}} music in the 2000s and later that was influenced by traditional screamo. In a review of City of Caterpillar's influence on the genre, reporter Jason Heller of Vice writes [...] "Call it post-screamo, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>must.</b> Okay, maybe don’t do that. But .... the early 00s weren’t {{the end of an era}} or anything so corny. It was just a transition." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{latest version}} of Keyes's {{long-term}} interest in a nonviolent military was published as a chapter in the book Nonkilling Security and the State, Joám Evans Pim, ed., 2013 [...] and as an illustrated stand-alone pdf, To Give Life: A Nonkilling Military: Precedents and Possibilities. In it, he elaborates ten kinds of missions for unarmed forces, including such obvious ones as Humanitarian Assistance / Disaster Relief (HA/DR), and hypothetical ones such as Defense {{in the spirit of}} Brazil's great national hero, Major-General Cândido Mariano da Silva Rondon (1865-1958), who fostered the motto [...] "Die <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>must,</b> but never kill." ...|$|E
2500|$|... dril's {{relatively}} {{high level of}} positive engagement on Twitter was noted in an informal statistical study of [...] "the Ratio", {{a rule of thumb}} or figure of merit popularly used on Twitter to quantify backlash to a given tweet. Data science startup Fast Forward Labs compared tweet statistics from dril's account to those of the politicians Trump, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Paul Ryan, and Mike Huckabee. In contrast to the unfavorable Ratio typically drawn by politicians' tweets, [...] "famed Twitter personality @dril's ratio is just about perfect," [...] with New Yorks Madison Malone Kircher concluding [...] "ever tweet, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> tweet, tweet like Dril, not like Paul Ryan." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{created the}} stage name Jesse [...] "The Body" [...] Ventura {{to go with}} the persona of a bully-ish beach bodybuilder, picking the name [...] "Ventura" [...] from a map as part of his [...] "bleach blond from California" [...] gimmick. As a wrestler, Ventura {{performed}} as a heel and often used the motto: [...] "Win if you can, lose <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>must,</b> but always cheat!", even going so far as having himself a T-shirt made with the words printed on the front. Much of his flamboyant persona was adapted from Superstar Billy Graham, a charismatic and popular performer during the 1970s. Years later, as a broadcaster, Ventura made a running joke out of it claiming that Graham stole all of his ring attire ideas from him.|$|E

2500|$|The {{book titled}} Type and Image: The Language of Graphic Design {{described}} the logo as [...] "a warm vernacular form, executed in thick script letters with Victorian swashes {{in the tradition}} of sports teams and orange crate labels." [...] The book mentions the cultural and material background of the city of Chicago as inspiration for the logo; for example, describing the leather embossing of Chicago VII as representative of the great fire and the stockades. The author connects the album art to the atmosphere of the band's namesake city, quoting the band's original manager, James William Guercio: [...] "The printed word can never aspire to document a truly musical experience, so <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> call them something, speak of the city where all save one were born; where all of them were schooled and bred, and where all of this incredible music went down barely noticed; call them CHICAGO." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the election, the McGovern/Shriver ticket {{suffered}} a 60.7 percent to 37.5 percent defeat to Nixon and Agnew. At the time, {{it was the}} second biggest landslide in American history, with Electoral College totals of 520 to 17. McGovern's two electoral vote victories came in Massachusetts and Washington, D.C.; McGovern failed to win his home state of South Dakota, a state that had delivered for the Democrats in only three of the previous 18 presidential elections in the 20th century. [...] The 1972 election was the first in American history in which a Republican candidate carried every Southern state. Nixon's percentage of the popular vote was only slightly less than Lyndon Johnson's record in the 1964 election, and his margin of victory was slightly larger. Barry Goldwater, who was defeated by Johnson in 1964, sent McGovern a newspaper political cartoon depicting {{the two of them together}} [...] "like Grandpa and Granny [...] linked by our defeats", with a note scribbled [...] "George -- <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> lose, lose big." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hastings {{represents}} the traditional English gentleman—not too bright but absolutely scrupulous, {{a throwback to}} the Victorian-era gentleman who is always concerned about [...] "fair play". Hastings himself notes that he is somewhat old-fashioned. While Poirot, who is not above lying, surreptitiously reads other people's letters or eavesdrops, Hastings is horrified of such acts and usually refuses to perform them to help Poirot in one of his cases. Although he lacks Poirot's intellect, Poirot often compliments Hastings' ability to remember facts and details about their cases even if he deplores the manner in which Hastings tells the story at times. Hastings' physical appearance is rarely described in the novels because he is often the narrator. However, it is mentioned that he, like Poirot, has a moustache which becomes a target of the detective's criticism in Peril at End House: 'And your moustache. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> have a moustache, let it be a real moustache, a thing of beauty such as mine.' Although he has served in the army, Hastings is not a ruthless man by nature, with Poirot noting during his final letter to Hastings in Curtain that he knows that Hastings is not a murderer.|$|E

2500|$|Gorgeous George {{was soon}} {{recruited}} to Los Angeles by promoter Johnny Doyle. [...] Known as the [...] "Human Orchid", his persona {{was created in}} part by growing his hair long, dyeing it platinum blonde, and putting gold-plated bobby pins in it (which he called [...] "Georgie Pins" [...] and distributed to the audience). Furthermore, he transformed his ring entrance into a bona-fide spectacle that would often take up more time than his actual matches. [...] He strolled nobly to the ring {{to the sounds of}} [...] "Pomp and Circumstance", followed by his valet and a purple spotlight. Wearing an elegant robe sporting an array of sequins, Gorgeous George was always escorted down a personal red carpet by his ring valet [...] "Jeffries", who would carry a silver mirror while spreading rose petals at his feet. While George removed his robe, Jeffries would spray the ring with disinfectant, ostensibly Chanel No. 5 perfume, which George referred to as [...] "Chanel #10" [...] ("Why be half-safe?" [...] he was famous for saying) before he would start wrestling. Moreover, George required that his valets spray the referee's hands before the official was allowed to check him for any illegal objects, which thus prompted his now-famous outcry [...] "Get your filthy hands off me!" [...] Once the match finally began, he would cheat in every way he could. Gorgeous George was the industry's first true cowardly villain, and he would cheat at every opportunity, which infuriated the crowd. His credo was [...] "Win if you can, lose <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>must,</b> but always cheat!" [...] This flamboyant image and his showman's ability to work a crowd were so successful {{in the early days of}} television that he became the most famous wrestler of his time, drawing furious heel heat wherever he appeared.|$|E
