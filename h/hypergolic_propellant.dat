5|$|Blue dinitrogen {{trioxide}} (N2O3) is only {{available as a}} solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them. although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by heterolytic fission to nitrosonium and nitrate in a medium with high dielectric constant. Nitrogen dioxide is an acrid, corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form nitric acid. Dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s. This is {{because it is a}} <b>hypergolic</b> <b>propellant</b> in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel and can be easily stored since it is liquid at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|Rocketry in the Soviet Union {{also began}} with amateur societies, {{foremost}} was the Group for the Study of Reactive Propulsion (GIRD) headed by Friedrich Zander and Sergei Korolev. From 1931 to 1937 in the Soviet Union, extensive scientific work on rocket engine design {{occurred at the}} Gas Dynamics Laboratory (GDL) in Leningrad, which was merged with GIRD in 1933 bringing rocketry fully under government control. The well-funded and -staffed laboratory built over 100 experimental engines {{under the direction of}} Valentin Glushko. The work included regenerative cooling, <b>hypergolic</b> <b>propellant</b> ignition, and fuel injector designs that included swirling and bi-propellant mixing injectors. However, Glushko's arrest during Stalinist purges in 1938 curtailed the development.|$|E
25|$|Nitrogen tetroxide {{is used as}} an {{oxidizer}} in one of {{the more}} important rocket propellants because it can be stored as a liquid at room temperature. In early 1944 research on the usability of dinitrogen tetroxide as an oxidizing agent for rocket fuel was conducted by German scientists, although the Nazis only used it to a very limited extent as an additive for S-Stoff (fuming nitric acid). It became the storable oxidizer of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s. It is a <b>hypergolic</b> <b>propellant</b> in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel. One of the earliest uses of this combination was on the Titan family of rockets used originally as ICBMs and then as launch vehicles for many spacecraft. Used on the U.S. Gemini and Apollo spacecraft and also on the Space Shuttle, it continues to be used as stationkeeping propellant on most geo-stationary satellites, and many deep-space probes.|$|E

500|$|Using the Gemini {{spacecraft}} for a manned Lunar landing {{was considered}} {{as early as}} the original Mercury Mark II proposal which led to the Gemini program. The initial proposal was for a Lunar orbit rendezvous mission, using a Gemini spacecraft and a lightweight, open cockpit lander, launched by a Saturn C-3 rocket. It {{was the first time that}} Lunar orbit rendezvous was proposed as part of a lunar landing concept. The spacecraft would have been tested in Low Earth orbit before the Lunar missions, using two Titan II launches. The lander, which was designed by NASA's Langley Research Center, would have had a mass of no more than [...] Some of the proposals had a mass as low as , with cryogenic propellants being used in place of heavier <b>hypergolic</b> <b>propellant.</b> The proposal was intended to provide a faster and lower-cost alternative to the Apollo program, which was at that time proposing a direct ascent landing.|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} pertaining to hypergolic fuel systems, particularly using hydrazine or its derivatives and hydrogen peroxide, has been conducted. It has been shown that a large effort has been made towards minimizing the risks involved {{with the use of a}} toxic propellant such as the hydrazine. Substitution of hydrazines for nontoxic propellant formulations such as the use of high purity hydrogen peroxide with various types of fuels is one of the major areas of study for future <b>hypergolic</b> <b>propellants.</b> A series of criteria for future <b>hypergolic</b> <b>propellants</b> has been recommended, including low toxicity, wide temperature range applicability, short ignition delay, high specific impulse or density specific impulse, and storability at room temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{ignition}} delay for the incipient sustained reaction of <b>hypergolic</b> <b>propellants</b> is of crucial importance. Too {{short of a}} delay can lead to injector damage while too long of a delay can lead to very large pressure spikes and engine failure. The coupling of the physical and chemical processes controlling the {{ignition delay}}s of <b>hypergolic</b> <b>propellants</b> renders the direct analysis of the transient ignition process very difficult. Well defined test conditions must, therefore, be specified to properly study the factors influencing the ignition delays of <b>hypergolic</b> <b>propellants.</b> ^ Theories regarding the thermal ignition of conventional <b>hypergolic</b> <b>propellants,</b> such as nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine-based fuels, have been established. The goals of the present research are to investigate the applicability of thermal ignition theories to the ignition processes occurring between a catalytically promoted fuel and hydrogen peroxide {{and to develop a}} model of the incipient reactions. The hypergolic fuel considered in the study is a methanol-based mixture containing a soluble metal catalyst. First, physical and chemical factors influencing an ignition event between liquid <b>hypergolic</b> <b>propellants</b> are discussed. Whenever possible, emphasis is placed on data obtained with fuels that are hypergolic with rocket grade hydrogen peroxide. Following this review, the applicability of traditional vaporization and ignition theories to the ignition of a catalytically promoted fuel with rocket grade hydrogen peroxide are discussed. An experimental program aimed at determining the effects of initial ambient pressure, initial ambient gas properties, and hydrogen peroxide concentration on ignition delay is presented. ^ Results show that ignition delay can be reduced by increasing the hydrogen peroxide concentration or the initial ambient pressure. The combined effects of large thermal conductivity and large mass diffusion coefficient of helium rich environments are postulated to be responsible for the significant increase in ignition delay observed with the lowest hydrogen peroxide concentrations. The precise assessment of the relative contribution of heat generation and heat loss due to transport of the ambient gas were difficult to determine in the present experiment. The agreement between the trends and predictions partially substantiate a phenomenological model of hypergolic ignition of a catalytically promoted fuel with rocket grade hydrogen peroxide. ...|$|R

40|$|Part of {{the initial}} concern with using the wet {{scrubbers}} on the <b>hypergolic</b> <b>propellants</b> was the subsequential disposal of the liquid wastes. To do this, consideration was given to all possible methods to reduce {{the volume of the}} wastes and stay within the guidelines established by the state and federal environmental protection agencies. One method that was proposed was the use of water hyacinths in disposal ponds to reduce the waste concentration in the effluent to less than EPA tolerable levels. This method was under consideration and even in use by private industry, municipal governments, and NASA for upgrading existing wastewater treatment facilities to a tertiary system.
