5|$|The aerial robots vary {{in design}} from fixed wing airplanes, to {{conventional}} <b>helicopters,</b> <b>to</b> ducted fans, to airships, and beyond to bizarre hybrid creations. Because the competition focuses on fully autonomous behavior, the air vehicle itself is of less importance.|$|E
5|$|After {{an hour on}} the ground, the {{helicopters}} left with the first 61 evacuees, including all American civilians and four heads of mission. Evacuees were provided blankets on one of the flights to remain warm. Complications with the only in-flight refueling on the return nearly prevented refueling, which would have forced the <b>helicopters</b> <b>to</b> divert to the Somali desert and await a rescue. At 9:40, {{the helicopters}} arrived on Guam and unloaded the evacuees.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the attack, Diệm ordered that all VNAF {{aircraft}} be grounded, and all aerial combat missions suspended while his security officials investigated fighter pilots for any possible anti-regime tendencies. This was achieved by placing tanks on the runway at Bien Hoa Air Base. Without assistance from accompanying fighter craft, the U.S. deemed it too risky for American <b>helicopters</b> <b>to</b> operate in the jungles against the communists.|$|E

5|$|Air Marshal Murdoch led the RAAF {{through the}} {{build-up}} of Australia's {{commitment to the}} Vietnam War beginning in the mid-1960s. He clashed with the Chief of the General Staff (CGS), Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, over the latter's recommendation in mid-1965 to deploy two UH-1 Iroquois <b>helicopters</b> <b>to</b> Vietnam. Wilton believed that both services would benefit from gaining familiarisation with air/ground operations in the region before large-scale commitment of Australian forces. Murdoch dismissed the idea on resourcing grounds, {{despite the fact that}} two-thirds of the RAAF's UH-1 complement had been purchased {{for the express purpose of}} army cooperation.|$|E

5|$|Attached to US forces, 1 RAR was {{primarily}} employed in search and destroy operations using the newly developed doctrine of airmobile operations, utilising <b>helicopters</b> <b>to</b> insert light infantry and artillery {{into an area}} of operations, and to support them with aerial mobility, fire support, casualty evacuation, and resupply. The battalion commenced operations in late June 1965 and initially focussed on defeating the Viet Cong's wet season offensive. During this time US 173rd Brigade, including 1 RAR, conducted a number of operations into War Zone D—a major communist base area at the junction of Phuoc Long, Long Khanh, Bien Hoa and Binh Duong provinces—as {{well as in the}} Iron Triangle in November.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, as General William C. Westmoreland {{learned of}} the North Vietnamese attack on Lang Vei and Lownd’s refusal to send a relief force, he ordered the U.S. Marines to supply enough <b>helicopters</b> <b>to</b> airlift a 50-man strike force {{with the aim of}} rescuing the survivors. Subsequently, Colonel Jonathan F. Ladd—commanding officer of the 5th Special Forces Group — and Major General Norman J. Anderson, {{commander}} of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing — were directed to formulate a rescue plan. While Willoughby and his men waited for help in the command bunker, Ashley and his Laotian contingent cautiously entered the Special Forces Camp.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 January, a 60-person Marine and Navy SEAL {{security}} detail was dispatched from Guam aboard two CH-53E Super Stallion <b>helicopters</b> <b>to</b> secure the embassy and prepare for the main evacuation. The two helicopters returned to Guam with the first 61 evacuees. Throughout the day, foreign diplomats and civilians sought refuge at the embassy. Four waves of five CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters each evacuated the embassy compound shortly after midnight on 6 January. The evacuees were transported to Muscat, Oman, where they disembarked on 11 January. In total, 281 diplomats and civilians from 30 countries were evacuated, including 12 heads of missions (eight ambassadors and four chargés d'affaires).|$|E

The U.S. had supplied F-16 Fighting Falcons to Pakistan on the condition they were kept at a Pakistani military base under 24-hour U.S. surveillance.|$|E

Between May 1966 and April 1967, he served as the air support coordinator for the Australian forces in South Vietnam; his initial refusal to commit RAAF <b>helicopters</b> <b>to</b> assist the Australian Army force that {{was in danger of}} being defeated during the Battle of Long Tan in August 1966 generated lasting controversy. Raw served in various staff and training positions until 1972, when he was appointed the commander of RAAF Base Butterworth. He returned to Australia in 1976 and retired from the RAAF two years later.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian Air Force sent five {{fixed-wing}} aircraft and three <b>helicopters</b> <b>to</b> {{the region for}} an extensive search and rescue (SAR) operation. As many as 200 personnel were reported {{to be involved in}} the operation, among them a group of Kayapo people familiar with the forest. The crash site of Gol Flight 1907 was spotted on 30September by the BAF, at coordinates , 200km (120mi) east of Peixoto de Azevedo, near Fazenda Jarinã, a cattle ranch.

Fire department officials sent search and rescue <b>helicopters</b> <b>to</b> the crash site, but efforts were hampered by thick fog. Nine bodies were initially found at the crash site, a number of them intact and still strapped into their seats. News reports indicated that these bodies had apparently been thrown clear on impact, and had come to rest alongside the tail section of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|With nightfall, the ceasefire {{imposed by}} United Nations Security Council Resolution 338 came into effect at 6:52pm, ending the battle. A {{large number of}} Israeli wounded {{were still on the}} battlefield. Sharon {{requested}} <b>helicopters</b> <b>to</b> evacuate the wounded, but Bar-Lev replied in the negative, as it was dark and too risky to land helicopters near the battlefield. The Israelis worked to extract the wounded from the battlefield anyway, and the rescue operations took some four hours before most of the wounded were finally evacuated. When sunrise arrived, Israeli paratroopers and Egyptian Sa'iqa sometimes found that there were no more than 20 meters separating their positions, but the ceasefire held.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} USAF investigation {{blamed the}} accident on several factors. The F-15 pilots were faulted for misidentifying the helicopters as hostile. Also, {{the crew members}} of the AWACS aircraft were blamed for their inaction in failing to exercise appropriate control and for not intervening in the situation. In addition, the {{identification friend or foe}} (IFF) systems had not functioned to identify the <b>helicopters</b> <b>to</b> the F-15 pilots. Furthermore, USAF leaders had failed to adequately integrate U.S. Army helicopter operations into overall OPC air operations. As a result of the investigation several USAF officers received administrative discipline but only one, Jim Wang, an AWACS crew member, was tried by military court-martial, in which he was acquitted.|$|E

5|$|After the Naugatuck River {{flood in}} Connecticut cut off {{communications}} and bridges, {{the state was}} effectively cut in two. The state's National Guard used <b>helicopters</b> <b>to</b> rescue people. Governor Abraham A. Ribicoff visited areas affected by the flooding, due to the damage, Connecticut was declared a federal disaster area on August20. The declaration allocated $25million in assistance to the state. Governor Ribicoff requested $34million in funds to rebuild and produce future flood mitigation projects; the state's funding was paid {{by a combination of}} bonds and tax increases. Including subsequent storms, the 1955 floods cumulatively killed 91people and left 1,100families homeless. Flooding occurred in 67towns, resulting in damage to 20,000families. About 86,000people were left unemployed after the floods. In Winsted, the buildings that were washed away along the south side of Main Street were never rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|Deceptive {{markings}} on helicopters further complicated matters for NATO pilots. Many of the combatants painted their <b>helicopters</b> <b>to</b> look {{like those of}} organizations that the UN's Zagreb Flight Coordination Center had authorized to fly in restricted space. For example, {{the army of the}} Republika Srpska often painted a Red Cross logo on their helicopters, and Croatian helicopters were given markings similar to those of UN humanitarian aid helicopters. The questionable identity of these helicopters became particularly problematic after the Black Hawk Incident in Iraq, because NATO pilots became more reluctant to engage potential belligerents without clear identification. As a result of the rules of engagement and difficulties in aircraft identification, NATO forces proved unable to stop most unauthorized helicopter flights, resulting in a documented total of 5711 unauthorized flights during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|In February 2002, the US Marine Corps {{commenced}} a {{study to}} identify potential replacement rotorcraft for the aging Sikorsky VH-3D presidential transport helicopters. On 18 December 2003, the United States Department of Defense issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the supply of 23 <b>helicopters</b> <b>to</b> {{be used as a}} replacement for the 11 VH-3Ds and 8 VH-60Ns of the Marine Corps' HMX-1 squadron, which performs the role of Presidential helicopter transportation; this requirement was given the designation of VXX, or the Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program. Two companies, AgustaWestland and Sikorsky Aircraft responded to the VXX RFP; additionally, that had been interest in a potential Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey-based bid, however the rotorcraft was deemed to be non-transportable by military airlift and thus unsuitable to qualify.|$|E
