40|$|Helicobacter pylori {{is not a}} {{risk factor}} for {{gastro-oesophageal}} reflux and oesophagitis, and there are arguments suggesting that H. pylori may actually protect against <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease.</b> <b>Gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> patients are less often infected with H. pylori than controls.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Transient lower {{oesophageal}} sphincter relaxations (TLOSRs) are {{the major}} cause of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> in normal subjects and in most patients with <b>reflux</b> <b>disease.</b> The gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor type B agonist, baclofen, is a potent inhibitor of TLOSRs in normal subjects. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of baclofen on TLOSRs and postprandial <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> in patients with <b>reflux</b> <b>disease.</b> METHODS: In 20 patients with <b>reflux</b> <b>disease,</b> oesophageal motility and pH were measured, with patients in the sitting position, for three hours after a 3000 kJ mixed nutrient meal. On separate days at least one week apart, 40 mg oral baclofen or placebo was given 90 minutes before the meal. RESULTS: Baclofen reduced the rate of TLOSRs by 40 % from 15 (13. 8 – 18. 3) to 9 (5. 8 – 13. 3) per three hours (p< 0. 0002) and increased basal lower oesophageal sphincter pressure. Baclofen also significantly reduced the rate of reflux episodes by 43 % from 7. 0 (4. 0 – 12. 0) to 4. 0 (1. 5 – 9) per three hours (median (interquartile range); p< 0. 02). However, baclofen had no effect on oesophageal acid exposure (baclofen 4. 9 % (1. 7 – 12. 4) v placebo 5. 0 % (2. 7 – 15. 5)).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Our {{understanding}} of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> has undergone significant changes {{over the last}} century. AIM: To trace the rise in {{understanding of}} <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> and highlight remaining areas of uncertainty. METHODS: Literature review. RESULTS: In 1906, Tileston published his observations on 'peptic ulcer of the oesophagus'. Winkelstein, in 1934, first correlated symptoms of heartburn with acid regurgitation and reflux oesophagitis. In 1946, Allison described hiatus hernia as a causal factor {{in the development of}} <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease.</b> In 1958, Bernstein and Baker showed a direct relationship between oesophageal acidification and heartburn in patients with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease,</b> irrespective of endoscopic findings, leading to the recognition of non-erosive <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease.</b> In the 1980 s, continuous recordings of the lower oesophageal sphincter showed that episodes of reflux were related to transient relaxations of lower oesophageal sphincter tone. There is now increasing recognition that <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> arises from the interaction of several anatomical and physiological factors. A turning point in the medical treatment of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> came with the introduction of the first proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole, in 1989.

40|$|Background: The {{natural history}} of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> in Asian {{population}} has not been studied before. Aim: To study the onset and disappearances of reflux symptoms over a 1 -year period in the Chinese population. Methods: A population-based telephone survey was performed in 2002 and repeated 1 year later. The change in prevalence rate, onset and disappearance of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease,</b> and the change in diagnoses were assessed. Factors associated with the onset and disappearance of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> were studied. Results: A total of 712 subjects completed {{the first and second}} survey. The annual, monthly and weekly prevalence of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> were 34. 1 %, 10. 1 % and 2. 7 % respectively. The onset rate (per 1000 person-year) and disappearance rate of any <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> and frequent <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> (≥ monthly symptoms) were 209, 40; and 395, 243 respectively. Forty-four percentage of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> subjects changed their diagnoses in 2003. By multiple logistic regression analysis, high anxiety score (OR: 1. 2, 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 1. 2) and higher educational level (OR: 2. 7, 95 % CI: 1. 3 - 6. 3) were associated with the onset of gastrooesophageal reflux disease; while the frequency of acid regurgitation (OR: 0. 35, 95 % CI: 0. 17 - 0. 70) and use of antisecretory therapy (OR: 0. 50, 95 % CI: 0. 28 - 0. 89) were associated with the disappearance of gastrooesophageal reflux disease. Conclusion: The prevalence of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> is stable over 1 year.

40|$|Nocturnal <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> may be {{important}} in the pathogenesis of reflux oesophagitis. This study aimed to determine whether: (1) <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> occurs during sleep in patients with reflux oesophagitis and, if so, to explore the mechanism, and (2) the sleep pattern of patients with oesophagitis {{is different from that}} of control subjects. After a standard evening meal, simultaneous manometric, oesophageal pH, and polysomnographic recordings were obtained in 11 patients with endoscopic oesophagitis and 11 control subjects. Patients with gastrooesophageal <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> had significantly more total reflux episodes throughout the nocturnal monitoring period than control subjects (105 v 6). Ninety two of 105 episodes of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> in patients occurred during the awake state and 10 during sleep stage II. A number of reflux episodes occurred during brief periods of arousal from the various sleep stages. Of the 105 reflux events recorded in patients, 42 were induced by transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation, 20 by stress reflux, 22 by free reflux mechanisms, and in 21 the mechanism was unclear. The sleep pattern and the time spent in each sleep stage was not different between the two groups. It is concluded that the awake state is crucial for the occurrence of nocturnal reflux episodes in normal subjects as well as in patients with reflux oesophagitis and that the difference between the frequency of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> between normal subjects and patients cannot be explained by different sleep patterns...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The {{association}} between <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> and sleep state in 24 infants with confirmed or suspected <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> was studied by monitoring both the pH {{in the lower}} oesophagus and polygraphic tracings made during sleep at night. <b>Gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> during the night was confirmed in 20 infants. Three hundred and sixteen precipitous drops {{of more than one}} unit of pH were recorded during the studies, 186 during periods of wakefulness. Of 130 drops in pH during sleep, 62 (48 %) began during active sleep and 62 during indeterminate sleep. Of the latter, 56 (90 %) were associated with brief gross body movements. Only five of the drops in pH (4 %) began during quiet sleep. <b>Gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> stopped during active sleep on 56 occasions (43 %), in indeterminate sleep in 62 (47 %), and in quiet sleep in 12 (9 %).

40|$|AIMS: The primary aim was {{to assess}} whether there were {{differences}} in symptoms, laboratory data, and oesophageal pH-metry between infants with primary <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> and those with reflux secondary to cows' milk protein allergy (CMPA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 96 infants (mean(SD) age 7. 8 (2. 0) months) with either primary <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux,</b> reflux with CMPA, CMPA only, or none of these (controls) were studied. Symptoms, immunochemical data, and oesophageal pH were compared between the four groups {{and the effect of}} a cows' milk protein-free diet on the severity of symptoms was also assessed. RESULTS: 14 out of 47 (30 %) infants with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> had CMPA. These infants had similar symptoms to those with primary <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> but higher concentrations of total IgE and circulating eosinophils (p < 0. 005) and IgG anti-beta lactoglobulin (p < 0. 003). A progressive constant reduction in oesophageal pH {{at the end of a}} feed, which continued up to the next feed, was seen in 12 out of 14 patients with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> secondary to CMPA and in 24 of 25 infants with CMPA only. No infants with primary <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> and none of the controls had this pattern.

Aim: To examine the association between <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> and {{irritable bowel syndrome}} in Chinese population in Hong Kong. Methods: Randomly selected ethnic Chinese {{were invited to participate}} in a telephone survey in 1996. <b>Gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> was defined as subjects having heartburn and/or acid regurgitation once weekly or more. Irritable bowel syndrome was diagnosed according to the Rome I criteria. The association between <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> and irritable bowel syndrome was calculated using a statistical model which allows the odds ratio to be measured. Results: One thousand six hundred and forty-nine subjects completed the interview (response rate 62 %). The population prevalence of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> and irritable bowel syndrome were 5 % and 4 %, respectively. Thirteen per cent of subjects with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> and 11 % with irritable bowel syndrome suffered from both <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> and irritable bowel syndrome. The OR of having <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> and irritable bowel syndrome together was estimated to be 3 (95 % CI: 1. 05, 6. 27) indicating a positive association between the two diseases. This association occurred predominantly in male subjects [OR = 9. 3, (95 % CI: 2. 3, 26. 2) ] but not as strong in females [OR = 1. 5, (95 % CI: 0. 3, 4. 3) ].

40|$|<b>Gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> is a {{condition}} in which the reflux of gastric contents into the oesophagus provokes symptoms or complications and impairs quality of life. Typical symptoms of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> are heartburn and regurgitation but <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> has also been related to extra-oesophageal manifestations, such as asthma, chronic cough and laryngitis. The pathogenesis of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> is multifactorial, involving transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations and other lower oesophageal sphincter pressure abnormalities. As a result, reflux of acid, bile, pepsin and pancreatic enzymes occurs, leading to oesophageal mucosal injury. Other factors contributing to the pathophysiology of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> include hiatal hernia, impaired oesophageal clearance, delayed gastric emptying and impaired mucosal defensive factors. Hiatal hernia contributes to <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> by promoting lower oesophageal sphincter dysfunction. Impaired oesophageal clearance is responsible for prolonged acid exposure of the mucosa. Delayed gastric emptying, resulting in gastric distension, can significantly increase the rate of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations, contributing to postprandial <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease.</b> The mucosal defensive factors play an important role against development of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease,</b> by neutralizing the backdiffusion of hydrogen ion into the oesophageal tissue. While the pathogenesis of oesophageal symptoms is now well known, the mechanisms underlying extra-oesophageal airway manifestations are still poorly understood. Two hypotheses have been proposed: direct contact of gastric acid with the upper airway and a vago-vagal reflex elicited by acidification of the distal oesophagus, leading to bronchospasm. In conclusion, <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> can be considered {{as the result of a}} complex interplay of factors, all promoting the contact of gastric acidic contents with the oesophageal mucosa, leading to different degrees of oesophageal damage...|$|E

Methods: Ethnic Chinese (3605) {{were invited to}} participate in a telephone survey using a validated <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: A total of 2209 subjects (58 % female; mean age, 40. 3 years) completed the interview. The annual, monthly and weekly prevalence rates of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> were 29. 8 %, 8. 9 % and 2. 5 %, respectively. <b>Gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> symptoms were associated with non-cardiac chest pain [odds ratio (OR), 2. 3; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 1. 7 - 3. 1], dyspepsia (OR, 1. 9; 95 % CI, 1. 4 - 2. 5), globus (OR, 1. 8; 95 % CI, 1. 2 - 2. 7), acid feeling in the stomach (OR, 5. 8; 95 % CI, 4. 5 - 7. 5) and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR, 2. 3; 95 % CI, 1. 5 - 3. 6), but not with dysphagia, bronchitis, asthma, hoarseness and pneumonia. Patients with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> had a significantly higher anxiety and depression score and required more days off work when compared with subjects without.

In reflux oesophagitis there was a decrease in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure and the contractions had a bizarre waveform suggesting a neuropathic process...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{ascertain}} {{the prevalence of}} Helicobacter pylori in patients with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> and its association with the disease. Design: Systematic review of studies reporting the prevalence of H pylori in patients with and without <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease.</b> Data sources: Four electronic databases, searched to November 2001, experts, pharmaceutical companies, and journals. Main outcome measure: Odds ratio for prevalence of H pylori in patients with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease.</b> Results: 20 studies were included. The pooled estimate of the odds ratio for prevalence of H pylori was 0. 60 (95...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{presence}} of the gastric pathogen, Helicobacter pylori influences acid suppression by proton pump inhibitors and treatment outcome in patients with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease.</b> AIM: To {{determine the influence of}} H. pylori infection on effectiveness of rabeprazole in primary and secondary care patients with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease.</b> METHODS: Patients from primary and secondary care centres with uninvestigated <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> (based on symptoms only) and investigated <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> (endoscopically confirmed oesophagitis or endoscopy-negative reflux disease) were tested for H. pylori and treated with rabeprazole 20 mg once daily for 4 - 8 weeks in a non-randomized, multicentre, open-label study. Primary end-point for treatment effectiveness was complete resolution of both heartburn and acid regurgitation at 4 - 8 weeks; secondary end-point was quality of life as registered with the Psychological General Well-being Index. RESULTS: Data of 1787 patients could be analysed; mean duration of treatment was 36. 3 days. At the evaluation visit 76. 9 % were heartburn-free, 77. 7 % regurgitation-free and 71 % had complete symptom resolution. Overall Psychological General Well-being Index scores improved accordingly. Treatment was equally effective in patients with or without H. pylori infection, but more effective in patients with oesophagitis when compared with symptomatic <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of rabeprazole in <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> is not affected by the {{presence of}} H. pylori infectio...|$|E
40|$|The introduction, in {{the last}} two decades, of {{strongly}} effective acid suppressant drugs, such as proton pump inhibitors has radically modified the way of treating <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease.</b> In clinical trials, these agents have constantly been demonostrated to be more effective than other acid-suppressant agents such as H 2 -receptor antagonists in relief of symptoms and healing of oesophagitis, the two main goals of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> treatment. They provide a prompt clinical benefit to most patients and can be safely used in long-term <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> management for maintenance of clinical and endoscopic remission, because of their negligible adverse-events profile. Therapeutic protocols vary depending on the severity of symptoms and the degree of oesophageal injury. In patients with mild symptoms and with minimal lesions at endoscopy, a "step-down" therapy, in the short-term, is considered the best medical strategy, while in the long-term the therapy "on-demand" appears to be a reasonable approach. Patients with non-erosive disease seem to have a lower response rate to proton pump inhibitor treatment. More severe grades of oesophagitis must be treated with full-dose proton pump inhibitors without withdrawal. Data on the treatment of extra-oesophageal manifestations of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> are few and controversial. Overall, it appears that patients with extra-oesophageal symptoms of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> must be treated with higher doses of pharmacological treatment, principally with proton pump inhibitors, and with longer periods of treatment to achieve complete relief of symptoms, as compared with patients with typical symptoms of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> <b>disease</b> and erosive oesophagitis...|$|E
40|$|Vagal {{function}} in 28 patients with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> was examined by determining gastric secretory response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia and pulse-rate variation with respiration. Gastric secretory studies were also performed on 13 patients with duodenal ulcer {{who had not}} undergone operations. In all patients the presence and degree of oesophagitis were determined endoscopically and mucosal biopsy and oesophageal manometry were performed. Seven of the 28 patients with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> showed evidence of impaired vagal efferent {{function in}} the upper alimentary tract. No such impairment was found in those patients who showed manometric evidence of oesophageal spasm secondary to <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux.</b> Low pulse-rate variation with respiration was found in 12 of 27 patients with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux,</b> suggesting dysfunction of cardiac vagal fibres. Impairment of efferent vagal supply may be a causative factor in some patients with gastr-oesophageal reflux but {{does not seem to}} be important in oesophageal spasm secondary to <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux...</b>|$|R
40|$|Eleven adult {{patients}} with nocturnal asthma, and <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> documented by endoscopy or ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring completed a double-blind cross-over study (4 week treatment, one week run-in and cross-over periods) comparing {{the effects of}} omeprazole 20 mg daily and placebo on asthma control assessed by symptoms, {{peak expiratory flow rate}} and bronchodilator usage. Omeprazole treatment did not improve asthma symptoms during the day or night, or peak expiratory flow rate readings. There was no difference in bronchodilator inhaler usage during omeprazole therapy. Treatment of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> with omeprazole in {{patients with}} nocturnal asthma and <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> does not improve asthma symptoms or peak expiratory flow rate. This suggests that <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> does not exacerbate bronchoconstriction in nocturnal asthma...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: <b>Gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> and {{dyspepsia}} are felt to {{be separate}} upper gastrointestinal (GI) conditions. We aimed to measure the degree of overlap between them, and assess whether endoscopic findings differed. Material and methods: Demographic, symptom, upper GI endoscopy and histology {{data were collected from}} consecutive adults in secondary care. Patients were categorised according to whether they reported <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> alone, dyspepsia alone or both, and patient demographics and endoscopic findings were compared. Results: Of 1167 patients, 97 (8. 3 %) had <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> alone, 571 (48. 9 %) dyspepsia alone, and 499 (42. 8 %) overlap. Patients with overlap symptoms were more likely to smoke, compared with those with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> alone, or dyspepsia alone (p[*]=[*]. 009), but there were no other differences. Patients with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> alone or overlap had a higher prevalence of erosive oesophagitis (18. 6 % and 15. 4 % respectively, p[*]<[*]. 001), but this was still the commonest diagnosis among those with dyspepsia alone (7. 2 %). No significant differences were seen in prevalence of other endoscopic findings. Conclusions: <b>Gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> and dyspepsia symptoms commonly overlap. There were minimal differences in demographics or spectrum of underlying organic disease between various symptom groups, suggesting that restrictive classifications according to predominant symptom may not be clinically useful...|$|R
