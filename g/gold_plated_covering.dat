A band of gold surrounded the helmet; in front were five laurel leaves in steel; at the temples two leaves of the lotus of the same metal.

40|$|Abstract — The {{systems and}} {{software}} development industry {{is characterized by}} a paradigm of project failure. There are various factors that can lead to project failure. One such factor is <b>gold</b> <b>plating.</b> <b>Gold</b> <b>plating</b> can cause various problems in the projects like increase in project complexity, use of more resources, and increase in time and budget of the project and many more. If effects of <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> are not estimated it will lead to the failure of the project. So, in order to estimate the effects of <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> we have designed a tool based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM). With the help of this tool developer can know the effects of doing <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> on the project and based on the output of the tool the developer can make subsequent decisions regarding the project.

40|$|<b>Gold</b> <b>plating</b> is very {{commonly}} used in different areas of techniques, for decorative purposes and corrosion protection. Electrolytes based on cyanide and ferrous cyanide solutions are still present in most of <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> baths, in spite of large efforts to replace them by some less toxic substance [1]. <b>Gold</b> <b>plating</b> from electrolyte based on cyanide is known as high-risk technology from ecological point of view. In this work the results of synthesis {{a new type of}} electrolyte based on gold complex on mercaptotriasole based are presented. Electrolyte itself is described elsewhere [2]. The goal was to establish the optimal parameters for decorative <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> for this type of electrolyte and compare the results with those obtained from cyanide electrolyte. The methods used were: recording of polarization curves to obtain limiting current densities, experiments in Hull cell and experiments in laboratory cell for <b>gold</b> <b>plating.</b> All experiments were performed with additives. The same experiments were conducted with the cyanide electrolyte but with all additives normally used for decorative plating [3]. This electrolyte can be successfully used for <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> in comparasion with expensive and risky cyanide bath. Final efects and characteristics pertaing decorative quality of gold coating are well satisfactory. Decomposition and recovery of waste solution can simply be done. Toxicity is not identified.

Their two-photon luminescence (TPL) and {{second harmonic generation}} (SHG) were investigated. The {{results show that the}} TPL and SHG intensity of <b>gold</b> <b>plates</b> is dependent on the wavelength and polarization of excitation laser. The TPL intensity of <b>gold</b> <b>plates</b> decreases with the increase of the excitation wavelength except for a small peak around 820 – 840 nm, while SHG intensity increases with the excitation wavelength redshift. In addition, it is found that the TPL intensity of the <b>gold</b> <b>plate’s</b> edge is related with the angle between the edge orientation and the polarization direction of the excitation light. The TPL intensity increases with the angle increase from 0 ° to 90 °...|$|R

40|$|Switch {{tubes are}} used in nuclear weapon firing sets and are {{required}} to be reliable and impervious to gas permeation for many years. To accomplish this, a <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> coating of approximately 25 microns is required over all metal surfaces on the tube exterior. The gold has historically been <b>plated</b> using <b>gold</b> cyanide <b>plating</b> chemistry. In this work we proposed to replace the cyanide plating bath with an environmentally friendlier sulfite <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> bath. Low and high pH sulfite plating chemistries were investigated as possible replacements for the cyanide <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> chemistry. The low pH plating chemistry demonstrated a <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> coating which met the high purity, grain size, and hardness requirements for switch tubes. The high pH chemistry was rejected primarily because the hardness of the <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> coatings was too high and exceeded switch tube coating requirements. A problem with nodule formation on the <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> surface using the low pH chemistry had to be resolved during this evaluation. The nodule formation was postulated to be produced by generation of SO{sub 2 } in the low pH bath causing gold to be precipitated out when the sulfite concentration falls below a minimum level. The problem was resolved by maintaining a higher sulfite concentration and providing an active filtration system during plating. In this initial study, there were no major obstacles found when using a sulfite gold bath for switch tube plating, however, further work is needed on bath control and bath life before adopting it as the primary plating chemistry...|$|R
