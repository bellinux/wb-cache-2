However, reaction pathways and chemistry behind these {{technologies such as}} pyrolysis and solvolysis of biomass are very complex. Contributing to the complexity are the many factors that could affect the reaction mechanisms. This research focuses on an external effect on thermal decomposition and internal reaction chemistry to provide an insight into the biomass decomposition for better performance. First, the effect of low concentration of oxygen in sweep gas during biomass pyrolysis in fluidized bed was investigated for practical purpose. It {{was found that the}} partial oxidative pyrolysis can increase the yield of pyrolytic sugars. A continuation of the study was performed to produce sugar-rich bio-oil from the biomass passivation of alkali and alkaline earth metals. Partial oxidative pyrolysis of passivated biomass produced approximately 21 wt% hydrolyzable sugars in bio-oil. Additionally, partial oxidative pyrolysis also prevented clogging within the reactor by reducing char agglomerations ensuring continuous operation. Second, solvolytic conversion of lignin was studied using a micro reactor {{in the presence of a}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>donor</b> <b>solvent.</b> The results showed that hydrogen donor solvents were effective in converting lignin into alkylphenols.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that carboxylic acids and carboxylates are major contributors to cross-linking reactions in low-rank coals and inhibit its thermochemical processing. Therefore, the thermolysis of aromatic carboxylic acids was investigated to determine the mechanisms of decarboxylation at temperatures relevant to coal processing, and to determine if decarboxylation leads to cross-linking (i. e., formation of more refractory products). From the thcrmolysis of simple and polymeric coal model compounds containing aromatic carboxylic acids at 250 - 425 �C, decarboxylation was found to occur primarily by an acid promoted ionic pathway. Carboxylate salts were found to enhance the decarboxylation rate, {{which is consistent with}} the proposed cationic mechanism. Thermolysis of the acid in an aromatic solvent, such as naphthalene, produced a small amount of arylated products (~ 5 mol%)), which constitute a low-temperature cross-link. These arylated products were formed by the rapid decomposition of aromatic anhydrides, which are in equilibrium with the acid. These anhydrides decompose by a free radical induced decomposition pathway to form atyl radicals that can add to aromatic rings to form cross-links or abstract hydrogen. Large amounts of CO were formed in the thennolysis of the anhydrides which is consistent with the induced decomposition pathway. CO was also formed in the thermolysis of the carboxylic acids in aromatic solvents which is consistent with the formation and decomposition of the anhydride. The formation of anhydride linkages and cross-links was found to be very sensitive to the reactions conditions. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>donor</b> <b>solvents,</b> such as tetralin, and water were found to decrease the formation of arylated products.

40|$|Solvent {{liquefaction}} (SL) is {{a promising}} technology for converting biomass to renewable fuels and chemicals. However, many technical barriers currently prevent the technology from commercial advancement. This research {{focused on the}} technical challenges that were confronted during {{the development of a}} continuous SL process development unit (PDU). A 1 kg hr- 1 pilot plant was designed to evaluate the technical feasibility of a continuous hydrocarbon-based SL process. The process was demonstrated to convert Loblolly pine to liquid products at a yield of 51. 2 wt%. The liquid products were low in oxygen content (23. 2 wt%) and moisture (13. 4 wt%). In addition to validating product yields and quality, several unit operations were also evaluated. Online solids filtration continuously separated over 99 % of the solid residue from the product stream. Acetone, injected into the process to aid in solids filtration, was continuously recovered with only 3 wt% loss to the process. Bio-oil fractionation via a distillation column was also demonstrated. A medium oil cut, suitable for use as a recycle solvent, was recovered using this system. This cut accounted for approximately 93 wt% of the initial solvent. The effect of moisture on SL of biomass in a hydrocarbon solvent (tetralin) was evaluated to help {{determine the extent to which}} the feedstock should be dried for the SL PDU. These experiments were conducted in a quasi-batch reactor with independent pressure control and external vapor recovery. It was found that increasing the feedstock moisture from 1 to 50 wt% resulted in a reduction in liquid yield of 25, 21, and 35 wt%, for pine, cellulose, and lignin, respectively. Analysis of the solid residue, which increased proportionally to the decrease in liquid yield, indicated acid-catalyzed polymerization of liquid products was the likely mechanism for solids-formation. The measured reduction of monomeric content in the liquid products supported this hypothesis. This behavior was attributed to the ionic dissociation of water at the reaction conditions, which resulted in increased acidic behavior. Although water was less than 20 wt% of the solvent loading in these experiments, it strongly influenced SL of biomass. A response surface methodology statistical model was constructed to evaluate the influence of process conditions on the SL of lignin in a phenolic solvent. The goal of this work was to develop a process capable of producing high liquid yields from lignin with a high selectivity for phenolic monomers suitable for use as a recycle solvent. The effects of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>donor</b> <b>solvent</b> blend ratio, reaction temperature, solids loading, and residence time were studied. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>donor</b> <b>solvent</b> and reaction temperature were found to be the most significant factors. Maximum liquid yield (58. 6 wt%) was achieved at temperatures as low as 260 ÃÂ°C and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>donor</b> <b>solvent</b> blend ratios of less than 30 wt%. As much as 40 wt% of the liquid products were volatile below 340 ÃÂ°C, which indicated a significant production of distillable phenolic monomers suitable for use as a recycle solvent. Thus, the use of a phenolic solvent at moderate reaction temperatures was demonstrated to be suitable for the design basis of a continuous SL process. The thermal stability of fractionated fast pyrolysis bio-oil was evaluated to determine the effect of rapid heating on bio-oil quality. These goal of this work was to develop a method with which to simulate rapid heating similar to the heating required for conventional refining processes, and to investigate the factors that most impacted thermal stability. Bio-oil fractions were produced from fast pyrolysis of Loblolly pine at 500 ÃÂ°C. Each fraction was heated to 100, 200, and 300 ÃÂ°C in under 120 s. Bio-oil acidity, as measured by total acid number (TAN), was found to be the most significant indicator of thermal instability. Samples with higher TAN values exhibited increased tendency to undergo polymerization reactions upon rapid heating. These findings were later extended to determine the thermal stability of bio-oil produced from the SL PDU. The goal of this was to evaluate the impact of thermal fractionation on bio-oil quality. In order to design and build the SL PDU, alternative methods were developed to determine selected thermophysical properties of bio-oil. The goal of this work was to utilize readily available laboratory equipment, instead of costly ASTM test methods and specialty apparatus. Specific heat, thermal conductivity, viscosity, surface tension, and enthalpy of vaporization were measured for six unique stage fractions and a mixture of these fractions from the fast pyrolysis of Loblolly pine.

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of global warming, caused by greenhouse gases has also fuelled the needs to utilise biomass, as its energy utilisation creates less environmental pollution and fewer health risks than fossil fuel combustion. Liquefaction of biomass using hydrogen donor solvents is a promising route to obtain clean biofuel using various solvents at moderate to high temperature (250 - 460. °C) and pressure (150 - 320. bar). Solvents such as sub-and supercritical water, alcohol, decalin, glycerol and tetralin {{can be used as}} potential hydrogen donor to enhance liquid oil yield with a reduced of oxygen content. Supercritical water with its excellent transport properties as well as hydrogen donor capability leads to hydrothermal decomposition of biomass and enhancing various compounds depending upon operating parameters.

The advantage of using <b>hydrogen</b> <b>donor</b> <b>solvent</b> is to stabilise the free radical in the biomass liquefaction and yielding a higher product conversion. Compared with non-hydrogen donor solvents, hydrogen donor solvents such as tetralin and decalin show significant improvement not only in conversion and product distribution to liquid but also on the quality of bio-oil (oxygen content) due to the improvement of hydrogenation and hydrocracking reactions with inhibition of polycondensation. The advantage of hydrogen donor solvents over the molecular hydrogen due to a lower strength bonding of C-H as compared to H-H bond.

Tetralin proved to be an effective donor for Arabian residua. HPLC and simulated distillation analysis showed that heavy compounds of the residuum were converted into lighter ones. When a ratio of tetralin to residuum less than 1 / 1 by weight was used coke formed in amounts proportional to tetralin. For ratios greater than 1 / 1 no coke formation was observed. A ratio of 2 / 1 was found to be a suitable ratio and was used in all runs. It was found that a minimum initial pressure of nitrogen gas (0. 5 MPa) was sufficient to keep the reactants in the liquid state. Otherwise, pressure had no effect on the conversion. As the temperature was increased the conversion to lighter products increased. The relative percentage change of both asphaltenes and carbon residue increase with temperature. Degree of desulfurization also increased with temperature. This preliminary study was limited to use a maximum temperature of 435 Qc. Increasing the temperature beyond this limit causes gas venting, and thus a loss of gaseous products. The system will be modified to work at higher temperatures by the method of rapid injection...|$|E
40|$|This is the {{quarterly}} report on our recent {{progress toward the}} overall objective to understand the supercritical fluid extraction of hydrocarbons from coal. Our strategy is to simulate coal as a high molecular-weight polymeric material by studying the degradation of polymers under various conditions. The hypothesis we are testing is that degradation of such macromolecules is applicable to the decomposition (depolymerization) of the coal network. Polymer degradation and coal liquefaction are influenced strongly by the solvent in the reaction. This motivated our investigation {{of the effect of}} hydrogen donor solvents on polymer degradation. In particular, we obtained new experimental data to show how a hydrogen donor, 6 -hydroxy tetralin, influences the degradation rate of polystyrene. We also developed a detailed radical mechanism for hydrogen donation based on the Rice-Herzfeld chain reaction concept with the elementary steps of initiation, depropagation, hydrogen abstraction, and termination. Expressions for the degradation rate parameters were obtained by applying continuous distribution kinetics to the MWD of the reacting polymer. The theory explains the different influences of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>donor</b> <b>solvent</b> on the degradation rate coefficients for different polymers. Though developed for the degradation of polymers, the mechanism and the theory are potentially applicable for chain scission and addition reactions among distributions of paraffins, olefins, and radicals of all chain lengths. The concepts can, in principle, be extended to examine the effect of hydrogen donors on coal liquefaction and on the complex mixture of liquefaction compounds. Based on this work, a research paper titled �Effect of Hydrogen Donors on Polymer Degradation,� has been submitted for publication. Our research paper entitled, �Molecular weight effect on the dynamics of polystyrene degradation,� has been accepted for publication by the journal, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research...|$|E
40|$|Thermolysis of 4 -aminophenyl benzyl sulfide at 523 K in the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>donor</b> <b>solvent</b> (HDS), 9, 10 -dihydroanthracene (AnH 2 ̆ 082), gave 4 -aminothiophenol and toluene as the {{predominant}} {{products of the}} homolytic S-C bond cleavage. Under these conditions, {{a portion of the}} 4 -aminothiophenol was desulfurized to aniline with first-order kinetics and with a rate constant estimated by kinetic modeling to be 7. 0 X 102 ̆ 07 b 2 ̆ 076 s 2 ̆ 07 b 9. Starting with 4 -NH 2 ̆ 082 C 2 ̆ 086 H 2 ̆ 084 SH at 523 K, it was found that sulfur loss was more efficient in the non-HDSs, anthracene and hexadecane, than in AnH 2 ̆ 082. Under similar (competitive) reaction conditions, YC 2 ̆ 086 H 2 ̆ 084 SHs with Y = H, 4 -CN, and 3 -CF 2 ̆ 083 were completely inert; with Y = 4 -CH 2 ̆ 083 O, there was some very minor desulfurization, whereas with Y = 4 -N(CH 2 ̆ 083) 2 ̆ 082 and 4 -N(CH 2 ̆ 083) (H), the sulfur extrusions were as fast as that for Y = 4 -NH 2 ̆ 082. We tentatively suggest that this apparently novel reaction is a chain process initiated by the bimolecular formation of diatomic sulfur, S 2 ̆ 082, followed by a reversible addition of ground state, triplet 3 S 2 ̆ 082 to the thiol sulfur atom, 4 -NH 2 ̆ 082 C 2 ̆ 086 H 2 ̆ 084 S(SS) H, and insertion into the S-H bond, 4 -NH 2 ̆ 082 C 2 ̆ 086 H 2 ̆ 084 SSSH. In a cascade of reactions, aniline and S 8 are formed with the chains being terminated by reaction of 4 -NH 2 ̆ 082 C 2 ̆ 086 H 2 ̆ 084 S(SS) H with 4 -NH 2 ̆ 082 C 2 ̆ 086 H 2 ̆ 084 SH. Such a reaction mechanism is consistent with the first-order kinetics. That this reaction is primarily observed with 4 -YC 2 ̆ 086 H 2 ̆ 084 SH having Y = N(CH 2 ̆ 083) 2 ̆ 082, N(CH 2 ̆ 083) (H), and NH 2 ̆ 082 is attributed to the fact that these compounds can exist as zwitterions.

40|$|Inadequacies {{of current}} {{recovery}} and disposal methods for mixed plastic wastes drive {{the exploration of}} viable strategies for plastics resource recovery. The combination of diminishing landfill space and increasing usage of plastic products poses a significant dilemma, since current recovery methods are costly and ill-suited to handle contaminants. Coprocessing of polymeric waste with other materials may provide potential solutions to the deficiencies of current resource recovery methods, including unfavorable process economics. By incorporating plastic waste as a minor feed into an existing process, variations in supply and composition could be mediated, permitting continuous operation. One attractive option is the coprocessing of polymeric waste with coal under direct liquefaction conditions, allowing for simultaneous conversion of both feedstocks into high-valued products. Catalyst-directed coliquefaction of coal and polymeric materials not only has attractive environmental implications but also {{has the potential to}} enhance the economic viability of traditional liquefaction processes. By exploiting the higher H/C ratio of the polymeric material and using it as a hydrogen source, the overall process demand for molecular <b>hydrogen</b> and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>donor</b> <b>solvents</b> may be reduced. A series of model compound experiments has been conducted, providing a starting point for unraveling the complex chemistry underlying coliquefaction of coal and polymeric materials. Tetradecane (C{sub 14 } H{sub 30 }) was used as a polyethylene mimic, and 4 -(naphthylmethyl) bibenzyl (NBBM) was used as a coal model compound. Neat and binary mixture reactions of tetradecane and NBBM were carried out in an inert atmosphere at both low and high pressures to establish a thermal baseline for subsequent catalytic experiments. Work {{in the past six months}} has focused on analysis of light gaseous products for neat reactions of tetradecane, resulting in mass balances greater than 94 %. The experimental protocol developed in the previous project period was used to conduct experiments at elevated pressures more representative of coal liquefaction conditions, and both neat and binary mixture reactions of tetradecane and NBBM were examined. Mechanistic modeling studies were also initiated in order to support and quantify the mechanistic ideas put forth to explain the experimental observations...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that <b>donor</b> <b>solvents</b> {{play a key role}} in the scission of thermal stable bonds in coal model compounds and therefore it has been speculated that they will improve liquefaction efficiencies. The authors have been studying the transfer of <b>hydrogen</b> from dihydroarene <b>donor</b> <b>solvents</b> to arene model compounds to quantify the barriers of competing hydrogen transfer mechanisms. Hydrogen can be transferred between arene rings by a variety of pathways. The specific hydrogen transfer pathway or pathways can be predicted given an understanding of the thermochemistry of the reactants intermediates and products. The individual pathways that contribute to strong bond scission have been shown to be dependent on the dihydroarene donor and the arene acceptor. In this paper they quantify the hydrogen pathways between the solvent components anthracene and phenanthrene. In addition, they describe reaction conditions requiring consideration of an additional hydrogen transfer pathway: a multi-step nonipso hydrogen transfer to coal model compounds to evaluate the hydrogen transfer steps to cleave strong diarylmethane bonds in coal structures...|$|R

In this work, a solution of peroxide crosslinked styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) has been transformed to a self-degradable gel system by adding hydroperoxide as a degradation agent to the formulation. This oil-based self-degradable gel has been characterized by linear oscillatory rheometry. In situ and ex situ experiments were performed to evaluate the evolution of crosslinking and degradation reactions, including the liquid-solid transition. Relaxation time spectra were calculated from dynamic mechanical frequency sweeps. Structural changes in the polymer network were visible within the relaxation time spectra, since it qualitatively showed the contribution of local simple entanglements and chemical covalent bonds to the final rheological behavior. The influence of peroxide concentration, polymer concentration, hydroperoxide concentration, and temperature have been studied and {{described in terms of}} rheological changes. Finally, a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>donor</b> aromatic <b>solvent</b> was used as scavenger to retard both crosslinking and degradation reactions. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym.
