40|$|The {{overarching}} aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the <b>Internal</b> <b>Quantitative</b> Efficiency (IQE) of the Postgraduate Diploma students at Libyan Universities. More specifically, the research sought to: compare different Libyan Universities according to the indicators of the <b>Internal</b> <b>Quantitative</b> Efficiency of Postgraduate Diploma students, examine the reasons behind failure of postgraduate diploma students, examine the reasons behind dropout of postgraduate diploma students, and to diagnose the reality of the <b>Internal</b> <b>Quantitative</b> Efficiency of Postgraduate students at Libyan universities. By addressing these aims and objectives the researcher hoped to be able to discover where strengths and weaknesses lie, and to help in building a foundation for future research in this area. A mixture of both quantitative and qualitative methods was considered appropriate to meet the needs of the research. Cohorts flow and statistical analysis of data from final examination result forms collected from universities were conducted which examined the numbers of registered students in each grade who: are required to repeat courses, fail in examinations and are assumed to repeat the same grade next year, drop out during the cycle, when compared to the number of those who complete their studies. Further, the study provides an examination of the reasons and causes for failure and repetition. A questionnaire was used to collect primary data for the study in order to gain information about those students who fail in exam and who repeat another academic year. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with both students that fail and drop out, in order to supplement and enhance the data obtained from the questionnaire. Using latent content analysis, responses from interviews were analysed. Findings reveal that there variations in the drop out rates between Libyan universities. The drop out rate was highest at Al-Arab Medical University and the lowest at Garyounis University. The drop out rate at Al-Arab Medical University was 32 %., while it was 28 % at Omar Al-Mokhtar University, 26 % AI- Tahadi University, and 24 % at Garyounis University. Various factors affect students failure and dropout from postgraduate studies at Libyan universities and can be summed in four factors, which, when ordered according to their strength of effect can be seen to be educational, individual, social, and economic factors respectively. The poor quality of the <b>Internal</b> <b>Quantitative</b> Efficiency is related to the problems of repetition and drop out.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} best {{practices}} {{related to the}} management of liquidity risk in financial institutions {{from the viewpoint of}} the standards, as well as its treatment in a series of countries. Firstly it reviews the best practices suggested by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the developments in European countries observed by the European Central Bank, and sound practices for liquidity risk management proposed in the supervision manuals of the US regulatory agencies. Secondly, it examines particular experiences of countries that apply policies for the management of liquidity risk, through their supervision manuals or their regulation. The paper also includes the experiences of some Latin-American countries that rely on a specific regulation of liquidity, together with the Argentine case. Although the importance of liquidity risk is well known, given the idiosyncratic characteristics shown in different banks, the organisms in charge of establishing the best practices regarding the subject prefer to give general principles that {{can be used as a}} guide in the management of the risk rather than to specify a <b>quantitative</b> <b>regulation.</b> Most of the analysed countries have adopted these recommendations, in some cases giving some freedom for the banks to apply internal methods, in others providing guidance for banks that don’t have advanced developments in the subject yet.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In mouse embryos, {{homozygous}} or heterozygous deletions of {{the gene}} encoding the Notch ligand Dll 4 result in early embryonic death due to major defects in endothelial remodeling in the yolk sac and embryo. Considering the close developmental relationship between endothelial and hematopoietic cell lineages, which share a common mesoderm-derived precursor, the hemangioblast, and many key regulatory molecules, we investigated whether Dll 4 is also involved in the regulation of early embryonic hematopoiesis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using Embryoid Bodies (EBs) derived from embryonic stem cells harboring hetero- or homozygous Dll 4 deletions, we observed that EBs from both genotypes exhibit an abnormal endothelial remodeling in the vascular sprouts that arise late during EB differentiation, indicating that this in vitro system recapitulates the angiogenic phenotype of Dll 4 mutant embryos. However, analysis of EB development at early time points revealed {{that the absence of}} Dll 4 delays the emergence of mesoderm and severely reduces the number of blast-colony forming cells (BL-CFCs), the in vitro counterpart of the hemangioblast, and of endothelial cells. Analysis of colony forming units (CFU) in EBs and yolk sacs from Dll 4 (+/-) and Dll 4 (-/-) embryos, showed that primitive erythropoiesis is specifically affected by Dll 4 insufficiency. In Dll 4 mutant EBs, smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were seemingly unaffected and cardiomyocyte differentiation was increased, indicating that SMC specification is Dll 4 -independent while a normal dose of this Notch ligand is essential for the <b>quantitative</b> <b>regulation</b> of cardiomyogenesis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study highlights a previously unnoticed role for Dll 4 in the <b>quantitative</b> <b>regulation</b> of early hemato-vascular precursors, further indicating that it is also involved on the timely emergence of mesoderm in early embryogenesis...|$|R

40|$|SummaryT cell {{sensitivity}} to antigen is intrinsically regulated during maturation to ensure proper development of immunity and tolerance, but {{how this is}} accomplished remains elusive. Here we show that increasing miR- 181 a expression in mature T cells augments the {{sensitivity to}} peptide antigens, while inhibiting miR- 181 a expression in the immature T cells reduces sensitivity and impairs {{both positive and negative}} selection. Moreover, <b>quantitative</b> <b>regulation</b> of T cell sensitivity by miR- 181 a enables mature T cells to recognize antagonists—the inhibitory peptide antigens—as agonists.

40|$|SummaryCytokinins (CKs), a {{class of}} plant hormones, are central {{regulators}} of plant growth and development. Based on numerous physiological and genetic studies, the <b>quantitative</b> <b>regulation</b> of cytokinin levels is the major mechanism regulating cytokinin action in diverse developmental processes. Here, we identified a different mechanism with which the physiological function of CK is modulated through side-chain modification (trans-hydroxylation). The trans-hydroxylation that forms trans-zeatin (tZ) -type CK from N 6 -(Δ 2 -isopentenyl) adenine (iP) -type CK is catalyzed by the cytochrome P 450 enzymes CYP 735 A 1 and CYP 735 A 2 in Arabidopsis. Deficiency in trans-hydroxylation activity results in dramatic retardation of shoot growth without affecting total CK quantity, while augmentation of the activity enhances shoot growth. Application of exogenous tZ but not iP recovers the wild-type phenotype in the mutants, indicating that trans-hydroxylation modifies the physiological function of CK. We propose that the control of cytokinin function by side-chain modification is crucial for shoot growth regulation in plants...|$|R

Previous studies revealed that its kinase activity is controlled by post-translational modifications, such as binding to cyclins and phosphorylations, but its transcriptional regulation is poorly understood. Here, we generated a promoter dissection series of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CDKA; 1, and used β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene-fused reporter constructs for expression analyses in planta. The results revealed two types of transcriptional control in shoots: general <b>quantitative</b> <b>regulation</b> and cell type-specific regulation.

The systematic characterization of variable fluorinated lipid domains revealed a significant dependence of the equilibrium radius of domains {{on the length of}} fluorocarbon chains.

An analysis of the mono–dispersive domains with narrow size distributions and the precise determination of molecular structure parameters with grazing–incidence X-ray diffraction measurements enabled treatment of the inter–domain correlations as two–dimensional colloidal crystallization and calculation of the potential of mean force. Furthermore, the head groups of fluorinated lipids can be modified with alpha –D–mannose and the specific ligand for an apoptosis receptor (CD 95 L). Both biofunctional molecules attached to the membranes showed specific interactions with target cells, revealing a significant influence of the lateral confinement of domains on the dynamic spreading of macrophages and cancer cell apoptosis.
