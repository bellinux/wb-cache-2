5|$|Humans must consume {{vitamins}} periodically {{but with}} differing schedules, to avoid deficiency. The body's stores for different vitamins vary widely; vitamins A, D, and B12 {{are stored in}} significant amounts, mainly in the liver, and an adult's diet may be deficient in vitamins A and D for many months and B12 in some cases for years, before developing a deficiency condition. However, vitamin B3 (niacin and niacinamide) is not stored in significant amounts, so stores may last {{only a couple of}} weeks. For vitamin C, the first symptoms of scurvy in <b>experimental</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> complete vitamin C deprivation in humans have varied widely, from a month to more than six months, depending on previous dietary history that determined body stores.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{predictions}} of the chemical properties of rutherfordium were based on calculations which indicated that the relativistic effects on the electron shell might be strong enough that the 7p orbitals would have a lower energy level than the 6d orbitals, giving it a valence electron configuration of 6d1 7s2 7p1 or even 7s2 7p2, therefore making the element behave more like lead than hafnium. With better calculation methods and <b>experimental</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> the chemical properties of rutherfordium compounds it could be shown that this does not happen and that rutherfordium instead behaves {{like the rest of}} the group 4 elements.|$|E

The Fly Room was cramped with eight desks, each occupied by students and their experiments. They started off experiments using milk bottles to rear the fruit flies and handheld lenses for observing their traits. The lenses were later replaced by microscopes, which enhanced their observations. Morgan and his students eventually elucidated many basic principles of heredity, including sex-linked inheritance, epistasis, multiple alleles, and gene mapping.|$|E

He developed tailored molecules of stimuli responsive smart hydrogels and explained the anomalous rheological behavior of complex fluids.He has documented his researches by way of several articles; Google Scholar and ResearchGate, online article repositories of scientific articles, have listed many of them. He holds a number of patents for the processes he has developed.|$|E
25|$|The solidus {{temperatures}} of most rocks (the temperatures below {{which they are}} completely solid) increase with increasing pressure {{in the absence of}} water. Peridotite at depth in the Earth's mantle may be hotter than its solidus temperature at some shallower level. If such rock rises during the convection of solid mantle, it will cool slightly as it expands in an adiabatic process, but the cooling is only about 0.3°C per kilometer. <b>Experimental</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> appropriate peridotite samples document that the solidus temperatures increase by 3°C to 4°C per kilometer. If the rock rises far enough, it will begin to melt. Melt droplets can coalesce into larger volumes and be intruded upwards. This process of melting from the upward movement of solid mantle is critical {{in the evolution of the}} Earth.|$|E

2500|$|However, <b>experimental</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> electrophysiology, {{beginning}} in the early 20th century and reaching high productivity by the 1940s, showed that the nervous system contains many mechanisms for generating patterns of activity intrinsically, without requiring an external stimulus. [...] Neurons were found to be capable of producing regular sequences of action potentials, or sequences of bursts, even in complete isolation. [...] When intrinsically active neurons are connected to each other in complex circuits, the possibilities for generating intricate temporal patterns become far more extensive. [...] A modern conception views the function of the nervous system partly in terms of stimulus-response chains, and partly in terms of intrinsically generated activity patterns—both types of activity interact with each other to generate the full repertoire of behavior.|$|E
2500|$|Intrinsic {{motivation}} {{has been}} studied since the early 1970s. Intrinsic motivation is the self-desire to seek out new things and new challenges, to analyze one's capacity, to observe and to gain knowledge. It is driven by an interest or enjoyment in the task itself, and exists within the individual {{rather than relying on}} external pressures or a desire for consideration. The phenomenon of intrinsic motivation was first acknowledged within <b>experimental</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> animal behavior. In these studies, it was evident that the organisms would engage in playful and curiosity driven behaviors in the absence of reward. Intrinsic motivation is a natural motivational tendency and is a critical element in cognitive, social, and physical development. Students who are intrinsically motivated are {{more likely to engage in}} the task willingly as well as work to improve their skills, which will increase their capabilities. Students are likely to be intrinsically motivated if they: ...|$|E
2500|$|The second {{controversy}} {{came when}} the 1983 prize went in part to William Alfred Fowler [...] "for his theoretical and <b>experimental</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> the nuclear reactions of importance {{in the formation of}} the chemical elements in the universe." [...] The controversy arose because Hoyle had been the inventor of the theory of nucleosynthesis in the stars with two research papers published shortly after WWII. So some suspicion arose that Hoyle was denied the third share of this prize because of his earlier public disagreement with the 1974 award. British scientist Harry Kroto later said that the Nobel Prize is not just an award for a piece of work, but a recognition of a scientist's overall reputation and Hoyle's championing many disreputable and disproven ideas may have invalidated him. In Nature, editor John Maddox called it [...] "shameful" [...] that Fowler had been rewarded with a Nobel prize and Hoyle had not.|$|E

2500|$|The {{nuclear fusion}} project International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor is {{constructing}} the world's {{largest and most}} advanced experimental tokamak nuclear fusion reactor {{in the south of}} France. A collaboration between the European Union (EU), India, Japan, China, Russia, South Korea and the United States, the project aims to make a transition from <b>experimental</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> plasma physics to electricity-producing fusion power plants. In 2005, Greenpeace International issued a press statement criticizing government funding of the ITER, believing the money should have been diverted to renewable energy sources and claiming that fusion energy would result in nuclear waste and nuclear weapons proliferation issues. A French association including about 700 anti-nuclear groups, Sortir du nucléaire (Get Out of Nuclear Energy), claimed that ITER was a hazard because scientists did not yet know how to manipulate the high-energy deuterium and tritium hydrogen isotopes used in the fusion process. According to most anti-nuclear groups, nuclear fusion power [...] "remains a distant dream". [...] The World Nuclear Association says that fusion [...] "presents so far insurmountable scientific and engineering challenges". Construction of the ITER facility began in 2007, but the project has run into many delays and budget overruns. The facility is now not expected to begin operations until the year 2027– 11 years after initially anticipated.|$|E
