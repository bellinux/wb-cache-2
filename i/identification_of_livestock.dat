40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} man and livestock through {{the examination of the}} livestock classification system and naming of individual animals among the Turkana, northwestern Kenya. In the Turkana's management system, livestock are treated as classes according to their attributes based on the classification system. The notion of distinct individuality is irrelevant to this kind of treatment. On the other hand, individual <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> is indispensable not only to the livestock management, but also to maintaining the human social relationship, which is mediated by livestock transfer. The former aspect is examined through analyzing livestock classification system. In the Turkana's classification system, a stress is put on the five domains: age-sex, coat color, horn shape, ear shape including ear markings, and brand marks. The management techniques relevant to producing categories of the livestock are described and analyzed. The method is described to check the presence of the members of a herd (195 goats) which are managed together in day-trip herding. The total herd is divided into several small units, and the members of each unit are checked one by one. The Turkana selectively apply several attributes of livestock for the unit formation. This division of the herd can be regarded as a livestock classification in a specific situation. After being divided into units, all the individuals are checked one by one. In this checking, livestock are treated as classes by being divided into small units, and also as distinctive individuals be being checked one by one. The aspect of livestock individuality is examined through the giving of individual names. The Turkana give proper names to all the parous females which are milked. Etymologies of 350 names are examined. All names refer to certain attributes of the named subjects. While livestock have many attributes, only one attribute is referred to in most names. The significance of individual identification in pastoral societies is discussed. It is important functionally, because people should make the pairs of mother and offspring encounter after the separation during a day-trip herding, for milking the mother and for the offspring's nutrition. Individual <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> has close connection also with the social relationships which are created and sustained by livestock transfer. Each transfer can be regarded as distinctive only when each transferred individual is identified as an irreplaceable unique animal. Livestock individuality is discussed also in relation to the identification between man and cattle in East African pastoral societies...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Microarchaeological methods, {{especially}} those focused on geoarchaeology and radiocarbon dating, have rev-olutionized {{the manner in}} which the Iron Age settlement peak in the Negev Highlands is interpreted. We review here results from field and laboratory studies conducted at two Iron Age sites (Atar Haroa and Nahal Boqer) compared to one Byzantine/ Early Islamic site (Wadi el-Mustayer) —all located near Sede Boqer. We present our methodology, which is based on small-scale but detailed excavations, study of sediments, and <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> dung remains and their utility as indicators of past subsistence practices. To this we add meticulous 14 C dating, ceramic petrography, and identification of botanic and zo-ological remains. We conclude that subsistence during the Iron Age included tending livestock but did not include agriculture. We further propose that the long-distance trade of copper from the Arabah Valley under Egyptian auspices and possibly the trading of cinnamon, dates, and other Arabian/Indian commodities were the driving force in the initiation (and later decline) of the Iron Age settlement system. We hypothesize that the agricultural settlement peak during the Byzantine/Early Islamic period was also influenced by an imperial power from outside of the Negev and that large-scale agriculture was enabled due to the adoption of new agricultural techniques, including terracing of ephemeral streams along with water diversion systems and possibly water storage facilities such as advanced cisterns. Future studies are expected to shed additional light on the complex-ity of settlement oscillations in the Negev Highlands region in key periods such as the Early and Intermediate Bronze Ages...|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} of pastoral {{sites in the}} East African archaeological record is problematic. Recently, a method for the {{identification of}} degraded livestock enclosure sediments had been developed {{that takes into account}} the geoarchaeological indicators of micromorphology, phytolith concentrations and the mineral assemblages. This suite of indicators may not always be present in degraded livestock enclosure sediments. This study presents an additional indicator by which degraded livestock enclosure sediments may be identified, namely the isotopic composition of organic nitrogen measured on bulk sediment samples. We studied a highly controlled ethnoarchaeological sequence of abandoned Maasai livestock enclosure sediments sampled in Rombo area, southern Kenya. The results were compared to archaeological sediments from the Elmenteitan Pastoral Neolithic site of Sugenya, southwestern Kenya, radiocarbon dated to ca. 2000 BP (uncalibrated). The sediments from both sites were studied using all four types of analyses, i. e., micromorphology, mineralogy, phytolith concentrations, and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions on bulk sediment samples. The results show that in abandoned livestock enclosure sediments of known ages a significant enrichment in the heavy nitrogen isotope (15 N) occurs, and that carbon isotopic compositions may be useful for differentiating cattle from caprine enclosures following their dietary preferences (i. e., grazers vs. browsers). A similar pattern of 15 N enrichment is observed in sediments sampled within the site of Sugenya while sediments sampled outside the site's perimeter are generally depleted in 15 N. The micromorphological, mineralogical and phytolith analyses support the conclusion that the sediments from within the site of Sugenya represent degraded livestock enclosure sediments. The carbon isotopic composition from the degraded dung deposits strongly suggests that livestock kept at Sugenya were cattle. Overall, this study presents new empirical data {{that can be used for}} the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> enclosures, and shows that the isotopic signatures and geoarchaeological indicators can preserve for at least two millennia. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Current {{approaches}} to estimate freshwater use in livestock production systems generally fail {{to consider the}} competition for water resources with alternative uses, such as production of food crops food or other ecosystem services. This article presents a new method {{to account for the}} competition for freshwater use between food crops and animal feed, while assessing freshwater use in livestock production systems. The developed water use ratio (WUR) is defined as the maximum amount of human digestible protein (HDP) derived from food crops from the consumptive water use (CWU) appropriated to produce 1 kg of animal-source food (ASF) over the amount of HDP in that 1 kg of ASF. The CWU for livestock production is first categorized according to the land over which it is consumed, based on the suitability of that land to produce food crops. Then, the method assesses food-feed competition by determining the amount of HDP that could have been produced from food crops, using the same CWU currently used to produce ASF. The method enables <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> production systems that contribute to global food supply without competing significantly over water resources with food production, based on their CWU. Three beef production systems in Uruguay are used to illustrate the method. During the backgrounding and the finishing stages, which are analyzed in this study, cattle can be kept on natural pasture (NP), seeded pasture (SP) or in feedlots (FL). The following three systems were analysed: i) NP-NP, ii) SP-SP and iii) SP-FL. Results show that the NP-NP system uses the largest amount of water per kg of beef output. However, results also show that the SP-SP and SP-FL systems can potentially produce more HDP by growing food crops than by producing beef. Based on the traditional measure for water productivity, i. e. the quantity of CWU per kilo of beef produced, we would conclude that the NP-NP system is least efficient, whereas based on the WUR the NP-NP system is the only system producing HDP more efficiently than food crops. Sustainable intensification not only implies improving agriculture and livestock productivity per unit of resource used, but also improving the number of human beings nourished. Results from this study illustrate the importance of considering competition and trade-offs with other uses when evaluating water use efficiency of livestock systems to promote sustainable intensification.

40|$|My {{objective}} {{for this}} senior {{project was to}} perform an extensive review of literature {{on the history of}} animal identification and common motivations for identifying livestock, the different types and methods of identifying animals, with a special focus on radiofrequency identification technology (RFID) and how it works. A secondary objective was creating an instructional booklet for the implementation of a RFID based management system on the Cal Poly dairy. The <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> for management or disease traceability has been a practice {{in one form or another}} for centuries (Blancou, 2001). Today, animal identification is of great importance to herd management and disease traceability (Voulodimos et. al., 2010, Murphy et al., 2008, Marchant, 2002). The type of animal identification used plays a role in the effectiveness and efficiency of herd management and disease traceability. In the 1940 ’s animal identification programs existed as part of an extensive program to eradicate bovine brucellosis from the national cowherd (Murphy et al., 2008). Over time methods have evolved from biblical evidence of Jacob branding his livestock, to ear tags, ear notching, biometrics, and RFID technology today (NABRE, Genesis 30. 37 - 42, Neary and Yager, 2002). RFID is a great method for identifying livestock for both herd management and disease traceability. In combination with herd management software, RFID systems can include detailed information like medical treatment records, animal performance data, and record animal movements (Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). These same records are necessary for disease trace back. RFID facilitates this by having a unique code for each transponder. Transponders can be embedded in plastic ear tags, covered in a biomedical glass capsule for subcutaneous injection, or placed into a bolus to be retained in a cow’s forestomach (Conill et al., 2000). The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 11784 describes the code structure for a standardized transponder. According to Kampers et al. (1999), a standardized transponder can handle sixty-four bits of identification code. Within the sixty-four identification bits, a code must be stored that can identify an animal uniquely worldwide. ISO standard 11785 describes the technical concept of the communication that all transponder manufactures must adhere to in order to ensure the standardization of RFID. There are two different systems for RFID tags, full-duplex (FDX) and half-duplex (HDX) (Kampers et al., 1999). The principle differences between FDX and HDX are the generation of operating voltage, the coding of information, and the timing of the information transmission (Artmann, 1999). I found that the benefits of RFID technology over previous methods of animal identification to be quite clear. RFID technology offers a much more streamlined, efficient, and humane way to identify animals correctly. From a historical stand point, no previous technology offers the quick and easy trace back that RFID technology offers. The main driver in this quick traceability with RFID is the utilization of a main identification database that would contain the needed information for trace back. My research led to the implementation of a RFID based herd management protocol that can be found in appendix A...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Identification</b> <b>of</b> global <b>livestock</b> {{diversity}} hotspots {{and their}} importance in diversity maintenance {{is essential for}} making global conservation efforts. We screened 52 sheep breeds from the Eurasian subcontinent with 20 microsatellite markers. By estimating and weighting differently within- and between-breed genetic variation our aims were to identify genetic diversity hotspots and prioritize the importance of each breed for conservation, respectively. In addition we estimated how important within-species diversity hotspots are in livestock conservation. Results: Bayesian clustering analysis revealed three genetic clusters, termed Nordic, Composite and Fat-tailed. Southern breeds from close to the region of sheep domestication were more variable, but less genetically differentiated compared with more northern populations. Decreasing weight for within-breed diversity component led to very high representation of genetic clusters or regions containing more diverged breeds, but did not increase phenotypic diversity among the high ranked breeds.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to take stock}} of the existing traditional veterinary knowledge and practices among the Rendilie/Ariaal and Gabra ethnic groups of Marsabit District and to determine the antibacterial activity of some of their herbal remedies after water and ethanol extraction. Increasing alternatives for prophylactic and therapeutic inputs and services against livestock diseases/ailments among the resource poor pastoral communities of Marsabit District was the main objective of,the work. The specific objectives were 1) <b>Identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> traditional healers (LTHs) among the Rendille/Ariaal and Gabra communities of Marsabit District and assessment of the level of existing veterinary knowledge (EVK) and practices; 2) collection, documentation and botanical identification of the plant species and materials that were considered usable for managing livestock diseases by the study communities; 3) screening of all the medicinal plants cited for antibacterial activity. The inventorized data were collected through participatory rural appraisal (PRA) workshops at the "Manyatta" level and residential workshops for specifically identified livestock traditional healers (LTHs). Some of the outputs from the PRAs were lists of renowned LTHs and crude data on the ethnoveterinary knowledge (EVK) as viewed by the general public. In addition, lists of important livestock diseases per species among the study communities were also generated at the manyatta workshops. The PRA workshops identified the renowned LTHs, who were used to fine-tune the raw data documented during the manyatta PRAs. The LTHs also collected herbal plants voucher specimens for sensitivity tests and for botanical identification. The well and disc reservoir methods for antibacterial sensitivity tests were used with water and ethanol as the extracting solvents. Micrococcus lutea and Bacilus cereus were used as the test microorganisms grown on Muller-Hinton agar. In total, 72 plant species in 34 families were inventorized as medicinal plants applied by the two communities in the prevention and cure of more than 20 livestock diseases. Some non-plant-based folk veterinary practices were also documented and induded salty soils and salty waters. In addition, manipulative techniques were also reportedly applied in traditional management of diseases and other animal ailments. These included surgical intervention, branding, and general massage. Burseraceae, Caparidaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Mimosoideae and Solanaceae were the five most common plant families used by the two communities. These 5 plant families accounted for 22 of the 72 medidnal plant species identified. Most of the diseases/ailments treated using the plant, the nonplant- based and/or manipulative indigen?>us veterinary remedies were divided into six broad but distinct categories, namely, digestive disorders; respiratory disorders; traumatic extemal injuries and ectoparasites; reproductive problems and infertility; eye infections; and mineral defidencies. There were more Gabra pastoralists (82 %) who used indigenous remedies as their first line of treatment than were Rendilie/Ariaal pastoralists (59 %) who also used indigenous remedies as their first line of treatment. Women appeared to play an insignificant role as LTHs as only 3 out of the 30 LTHs (10 %) identified from the Gabra community and 4 out of the 24 LTHs (17 %) from the Rendille/Ariaal community were women. Specialization of the LTHs from both communities was evident Areas of specialization induded general practioners, bone setters, camel diseases specialists and specialists on camel dystocia and infertility. Sensitivity tests revealed that some of the herbal plants used by the two communities had very high antibacterial activity. Out of the 72 plant species cited as medicinal by both study ethnic groups, only 36 (50 %) were available for screening for antibacterial activity. Out of these, 21 were from Rendille/Ariaal community and 15 from Gabraland. Roots of Terminalia brownii from Rendille/Ariaal region showed the highest activity against M. lutea, with an inhibition zone (diameter) of 24 mm and 25 mm with ethanol and water extracts, respectively, using the disc reservoir method. Using the well reservoir method, the roots of the same herb showed an inhibition zone of 24 mm and 23 mm with ethanol and water extracts, respectively. Water extract of Balanites aegyptiaca leaves from Gabraland using the disc reservoir method gave an inhibition zone of 10 mm and 7 m~ against B. cereus and M. lutes, respectively. Under the same extraction method, fruits/seeds of Solanum incanum showed inhibition zones of 9 mm and 9 mm for B. cereus and M. lutea respectively. Of the 15 medicinal plants from Gabraland, an extract of whole shrub of Cucumis dipsaceus gave the highest inhibition zone (14 mm) with B. cereus compared 7 mm showed by M. lutea after ethanol extraction in well reservoir method. The water extraction of Commiphora flaviflora stem gave 10 mm and 9 mm against B. cereus and M. lutea, respectively. Based on these findings, it is concluded that rich traditional veterinary practices among the Rendilie/Ariaal and Gabra communities of Marsabit District exist and that some of the medicinal plants used by these ethnic groups contain demonstrable antibacterial activity. Given that modem veterinary drugs {{are not likely to be}} readily available to these communities in the near future, there is a need to conduct clinical trials using the indigenous remedies in an effort to asses their efficacy and to develop dosage recommendations of the proven ones. This will offer alternatives to modem veterinary inputs, leading to improved animal health care delivery for the resource poor pastoralists of Marsabit District and other ASAL areas of Kenya...|$|E
40|$|The {{services}} provided by Livestock Identification Services {{play an important role}} in the facilitation of commerce through brand inspection and by helping to verify ownership. In this regard, the recently privatized LIS continues to successfully fulfil its mission. The goals of LIS are: · Value · Accountability · Flexibility · Recognition · Viability · Effective enforcement. Based on the research conducted for this project, it can be concluded that during the three years in which LIS has been in existence, the organization has met its goals. LIS has been found to be an efficient, well managed organization with a dedicated staff. With regard to costs and benefits, the primary benefits associated with the regulations administered by LIS relate to the deterrence of theft as a result of the brand inspection system. An important related benefit is the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> through branding and the brand inspection process. While these benefits are extremely difficult to quantify, they do in fact have a dollar value associated with them. The benefits that have dollar values attached to them include: · livestock thefts deterred · lawsuits avoided · prosecutions avoided · reduced police investigations · cattle returned to rightful owners · manifest corrections Unlike benefits, costs are easier to quantify. Direct costs such as the dollar inspection fee and the overall budget associated with LIS are open to public scrutiny. There are also indirect costs that may result from complying with the regulations LIS is responsible for carrying out. Such indirect costs include additional weight loss and inventory management effort. With that said, however, this research has not found these additional indirect costs to be significant. The one additional cost associated with brand inspection that was identified in this research is hide damage. This is a material cost, but given that branding is not mandatory, it is questionable whether the damage can be considered a cost of compliance. Due to the nature of the benefits associated with LIS, it is not appropriate to take a ledger approach and add up the dollar value of benefits in order to determine a specific benefit-cost ratio. This inability to calculate a specific ratio is due to the fact that each of the benefits has a very wide range of possible values. With that said, the evidence associated with the calculations for each of the benefits leads to the conclusion that total value of the benefits of LIS exceeds the direct and material or significant indirect costs of LIS (not counting damaged hides). The same line of thought and rationale for determining benefits also leads to the conclusion that most of the benefits of brand inspection rest at the cow-calf sector. While benefits exceed costs, and while LIS has successfully met its mission and goals, the organization and the industry continue to adjust to LIS' role as a private sector organization. For example, some of the government policies and directives utilized in the past have at times been shown to be at cross purposes with how LIS must operate now. This has created tension in the industry. The issue of conversion has highlighted questions as to the efficacy of brand inspection with regard to ownership verification. Furthermore, the organization also continues to adjust to the fact that the legislation it is responsible for was written at a time when the feedlot sector was radically different in size and structure than it is today. Finally there needs to be a better matching of benefits and costs between the feedlot and cow-calf sectors. These are the main challenges of the future for LIS. The survey of cow/calf producers and feedlot operators indicates that both groups have a relatively high level of awareness of most of the {{services provided}} by LIS. The vast majority of respondents in both groups are also aware that brand inspection services have been transferred to the private sector. Approximately half of producers surveyed stated that brand inspection and/or verification of brand ownership is the most important function of LIS in their own operations. A similar proportion of respondents feel that the main benefit of LIS is verification of ownership of livestock. A significant group of large feedlot operators, however, feel that LIS has no important function in their operation, nor does LIS have any benefits. Producers in both sectors feel that cow/calf producers are the primary beneficiary of LIS services. The surveys also indicate that both groups of producers are satisfied with LIS overall and specific LIS services, although the cow/calf group recorded a slightly higher overall satisfaction level. Satisfaction among cow/calf producers is quite homogeneous across operation size, however the large feedlot operators gave a lower satisfaction rating than the other feedlot groups. The majority of respondents from both sectors also said they did not have any concerns regarding LIS services. The two sectors differ in their opinion of whether they receive good value for LIS fees. Cow/calf producers overwhelming feel that they do, while feedlot operators as a group are essentially split in their responses. Within the feedlot group, opinions are also divided, as almost three-quarters of the largest feedlot operations feel that they do not receive good value. Cow/calf producers and feedlot operators do agree that LIS should continue to provide all of the services it currently does, and not take on any additional responsibilities. The discussions in the focus groups also support this view. The focus groups also identified issues such as conversion and the need to better match benefits and costs between the cow/calf and feedlot sectors that need to be addressed and resolved in order for LIS to be successful in the long term. ...|$|E
40|$|Production of {{food has}} re-emerged {{at the top}} of the global {{political}} agenda, driven by two contemporary challenges: the challenge to produce enough nutritious food to feed a growing and more prosperous human population, and the challenge to produce this food in an environmentally sustainable way. Current levels of production of especially animal-source food (ASF), pose severe pressure on the environment via their emissions to air, water, and soil; and their use of scarce resources, such as land, water, and fossil energy. The livestock sector, for example, is responsible for about 15 % of the global anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and uses about 70 % of global agricultural land. Many proposed mitigation strategies to feed the world sustainably, therefore, focus primarily on reducing the environmental impact of the livestock sector, so-called production-side strategies. Other strategies focus on changing consumption patterns by reducing consumption of ASF, or on shifting from ASF with a higher environmental impact (e. g. beef) to ASF with a lower environmental impact (e. g. pork or chicken), so called consumption-side strategies.   Most of the environmental impact of production of ASF is related to production of feed. One production-side strategy to reduce the environmental impact is the use of products that humans cannot or do not want to eat, such as co-products, food-waste, and biomass from marginal lands for livestock feed (referred to as ‘leftover streams’ in this thesis). This strategy is effective, because feeding leftover streams to livestock transforms an inedible food stream into high-quality food products, such as meat, milk, and eggs. Two production-side strategies that use leftover streams as livestock feed were explored in this thesis: replacing soybean meal (SBM) in diets of growing pigs with either rapeseed meal (RSM) or with waste-fed larvae meal. Replacing SBM with RSM in growing-pig diets was assessed because RSM became increasingly available following an increase in bio-energy production in the EU. In this strategy, therefore, the RSM content in pig diets increased at the expense of SBM. SBM is an ingredient associated with a high environmental impact. It was expected, therefore, that replacing SBM with RSM in pig diets would lead to a decrease in the environmental impact of pork production. Replacing SBM with waste-fed larvae meal was assessed because recent developments show the environmental benefits of rearing insects as livestock feed. Insects have a low feed conversion ratio (kg feed/kg product) and can be consumed completely, without residual materials, such as bones or feathers. The nutritional value of insects is high, especially as a protein source for livestock. Insect-based feed products, therefore, can replace conventional feed ingredients, such as SBM. Altogether this strategy suggests that waste-fed larvae meal might become an important alternative feed source in the future. To gain insight into the status quo of the environmental impact of both mitigation strategies, replacing SBM with RSM or with waste-fed insects, we first used the attributional life cycle assessment (ALCA) method. Based on the ALCA method, results showed that each mitigation strategy was promising. Replacing SBM with RSM in growing pig diets hardly changed either global warming potential (GWP) or energy use (EU), but decreased land use (LU) up to 16 % per kg body weight gain. As expected, feed production had the largest environmental impact, responsible for about 50 % of the GWP, 60 % of the EU, and 77 % of the total LU. Feed production in combination with feed intake, were the most sensitive parameters; a small change in both these two parameters changed the results. Replacing SBM with waste-fed larvae meal in growing-pig diets showed that EU hardly changed, but GWP (29 %) and LU (54 %) decreased per kg body weight gain. Based on ALCA results, each mitigation strategy, therefore, seems to offer potential to reduce the environmental impact of pork production. An ALCA, however, has two disadvantages: it does not account for product-packages and it does not consider feed-food competition. The first disadvantage of ALCA was that the complexity of dealing with product-packages is not fully considered. ‘Product-package’ refers to a multiple-output situation. During the processing of sugar beet, for example, beet-pulp and molasses are produced in addition to sugar. Sugar, beet-pulp, and molasses together form a ‘package of products’ because they cannot be produced independently from each other. An ALCA does not account for the fact that the production volume of the co-product(s) depends on the demand for the determining product (e. g. sugar), which results in the limited availability of co-products. Increasing the use of co-products in animal feed, consequently, results in reducing use of a co-product in another sector, requiring them to be replaced with a different product. The environmental impact of increasing the use of a co-product or food-waste, therefore, depends on the net environmental impact. The net environmental impact refers to the environmental benefits of using the product in its new application minus the environmental cost of replacing the product in its old application. A consequential theoretical framework was developed to account for product-packages. The results, based on the consequential framework, contradicted standard ALCA results. The consequential LCA (CLCA) method we used for replacing SBM with RSM showed an increased GWP (up to 15 %), EU (up to 12 %), and LU (up to 10 %) per kg body weight gain. Moreover, this CLCA method showed that replacing SBM with waste-fed larvae meal increased GWP (60 %) and EU (90 %), but decreased LU (73 %) per kg body weight gain. Accounting for product-packages increased the net environmental impact of each strategy, replacing SBM with RSM or with waste-fed larvae meal. The difference in results between ALCA and CLCA was especially large in the strategy with waste-fed larvae meal. The difference was caused mainly by the use of food-waste. Food-waste fed to larvae was used initially to produce bio-energy via anaerobic digestion. In CLCA, the environmental impact related to replacing the bio-energy function of food-waste with fossil-energy was included. The net environmental impact became negative, because environmental benefits of replacing SBM with waste-fed larvae meal were less than environmental costs related to the marginal energy source, i. e. fossil energy, replacing the bio-energy. Results of the indirect environmental impact, however, are situation specific: if the marginal energy source were wind or solar energy, the net environmental impact of using waste-fed larvae meal might be positive. Waste-fed larvae meal, therefore, appears to be an interesting mitigation strategy only when energy from wind and solar energy are used more dominantly than energy from fossil sources. If results were based solely on ALCA, then these potentially negative impacts would have been overlooked. Consideration of the environmental consequences of product-packaging, therefore, is essential to determine total environmental costs. If policy makers or the feed industry want to assess the net environmental impact of a potential mitigation strategy, then we recommend to perform a CLCA instead of an ALCA. The framework developed in this thesis can be used to perform such an assessment. The second disadvantage of an LCA was that it does not take into account feed-food competition, e. g. competition for land between humans and animals.   Most LCA studies focus on the total amount of land required to produce one kg ASF. LCA studies do not account for competition for land between humans and animals, or so-called feed-food competition. In other words, they do not include, differences in the consumption of human-edible products by various livestock species or differences in the suitability of land used for feed production as land to cultivate food-crops directly. Given the global constraints on land, it is more efficient to grow food directly for human consumption rather than for livestock. To address the contribution of livestock to a future sustainable food supply, a measure for land use efficiency was developed, called the land use ratio (LUR). The LUR accounts for plant productivity, efficiency of converting human-inedible feed into ASF, and suitability of land for crop cultivation. The LUR also has a life-cycle perspective. Results of the LUR illustrated that dairy cows on sandy soil, laying hens, and pig production systems in the Netherlands have a LUR > 1. 0. In terms of protein produced per m 2, therefore, it is more efficient to use these soils for livestock production to produce crops for direct human consumption than to produce feed for livestock. Only dairy cows on peat soil produce human digestible protein (HDP) more efficiently than crops do, because peat is not suitable for crop production. The LUR allows <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> production systems that are able to produce HDP more efficiently than crops do. Livestock systems with a LUR< 1. 0, such as dairy on peat, have an important role to play in future sustainable nutrition supply. Results of the LUR showed that livestock production systems using mainly co-products, food-waste, and biomass from marginal land, can produce human digestible protein more efficiently than crop production systems do. The availability of those leftover streams,  however, is limited and, therefore, the amount of ASF produced based only on leftover streams is also limited. Because LUR is a ratio, LUR results do not give an indication of how much ASF can be produced based on livestock systems that feed mainly on leftover streams. The third, and last, mitigation strategy, therefore, focused on the amount of ASF that can be consumed by humans, when livestock are fed only on leftover steams, also referred to as “default livestock”. The calculation of the amount of ASF was based on the assumption that a vegan diet was consumed in principle. The resulting co-products and food-waste were fed to pigs and, biomass from grazing land was fed to ruminants. Results showed that in total 21 g animal source protein per person per day could be produced by feeding livestock entirely on leftovers. Considering feed-food crops and feeding food-waste made an important contribution to the 21 g of protein that could be produced from default livestock. Considering feed-food crops implies that choices have to be made between different crops, based on their contribution to feed and food production. Oil production from soy cultivation, for example, resulted in the co-product SBM. Results showed that considering feed-food crops can affect the final protein production from pork. The practice of feeding food-waste to livestock is currently prohibited due to problems of food safety but the practice shows potential in extensively reducing the environmental impact of livestock production. Considering feed-food crops and feeding food-waste are examples of mitigation strategies that currently can be implemented to reduce further the environmental impact of the livestock sector. On average, it is recommended to consume about 57 g of protein from ASF or plant-origin per person per day. Only ASF from default livestock does not fulfil the current global protein consumption of 32 g per person per day, but about one third of the protein each person needs can be produced without any competition for land between feed and food production. To feed the world more sustainably, by requiring livestock production systems with a LUR < 1. 0, however, a paradigm shift is needed. Global average consumption of ASF should decrease to about 21 g of protein per person per day. Innovations are needed, moreover, to overcome problems of food safety and technical concerns related to collecting the leftover streams. This  applies, in particular to food-waste, which is currently unused in livestock production but which presents a valuable strategy in mitigating environmental impacts caused by livestock production. Livestock systems should change their focus, furthermore, from increasing productivity per animal towards increasing protein production for humans per ha. By using leftover streams optimally, the livestock sector is able to produce a crucial amount of protein, while still avoiding competition for land between feed and food crops. Livestock, therefore, can make an important contribution to the future nutrition supply...|$|E
40|$|Historically, {{the primary}} {{determinant}} {{for the state}} of parasitism has been the concentration of nematode eggs in the faeces (FEC). This descriptor has a number of limitations that have implications for the development of drug resistance and hamper the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> resilient <b>livestock.</b> A major fallacy is that FEC can reliably assess the worm burden, the need for anthelmintic and the efficacy of that treatment. FEC is a ratio, eggs per gram of faeces, not a quantity. Not only is the denominator ignored but interpretation of the numerator requires knowledge of nematode species present and female fecundity which can be affected by infra-population dynamics. By definition, a parasite exists at the expense of its host. As such, the consistent ability of resilient animals to maintain performance, despite a high FEC, strongly suggests that FEC does not provide a reliable indicator of the cost of parasitism. This manuscript reviews the factors that affect FEC and argues for a step change in our approach to the control of nematode parasitism in pastoral systems to one focused on individual treatments based on animal performance utilising radio-frequency electronic identification and automated weighing and drafting systems...|$|R
40|$|Studies of {{population}} structure and diversity in cattle have provided {{insights into the}} origins of breeds, their history and evolution, and allow the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> global <b>livestock</b> diversity hotspots, which is important for conservation of diversity. Genetic diversity, genetic relationship, population structure, {{and the presence of}} hotspots of genetic diversity among 15 European bovine breeds from five countries were assessed using 435 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) markers identified in candidate genes for muscle, lipid and energy metabolism, thus providing the opportunity to compare the breed relationships obtained using putatively functional markers with previous data using neutral loci. Individuals belonging to 11 breeds tended to be clearly assigned to a single cluster when the number of pre-defined populations reached a maximum in the likelihood of the data at K= 12, whereas Asturiana de los Valles, Danish Red, Simmental, and Avilena-Negra Iberica displayed a greater degree of admixture, which may be explained by their diverse ancestry. Although overall results were in agreement with those reported by studies based on neutral genetic variations, some additional breed relationship information emerged using markers in candidate functional loci, including the relationship between the Asturiana de los Valles and Piedmontese, and Danish Red and Charolais breeds. This study indicates that the analysed loci have not been main targets for selection or for adaptation processes, but also that SNP within candidate genes related with beef characteristics and performance may provide a slightly new perspective on past breeding and may also help in the development of strategies for the rational conservation <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> diversity...|$|R

Abstract The <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>livestock</b> {{production systems}} (LPS) existing in a given area constitutes the first step to manage farms sustainably, since it improves the knowledge of its operation and subsequently allows for establishing the appropriate managerial strategies for each LPS. It is of great interest, as LPS are key for agro-ecosystem conservation and rural population in many areas. The present study was conducted in light {{of the importance of the}} beef cattle sector for one of the oldest and most heavily protected agroforestry systems (‘dehesa’, SW Spain and Portugal). A total of 63 beef cattle farms (including organic and conventional ones) were analysed from the structural and technical-economic points of view, aiming to: (i) improve the knowledge of the dehesa beef cattle sector; (ii) define specific managerial strategies tailored to each typology (LPS) in order to increase their sustainability as well as that of the dehesa ecosystem; (iii) clarify whether there is a relationship between the typologies obtained on the basis of technical-economic indicators and a previous classification of the farms based on their condition of being organic, and their productive and market orientation. For this purpose, the analysis paid special attention to the level of intensification, productive orientation (presence of a calf-finishing period) and self-reliance (related to their dependence on subsidies). The methodology yielded the following four typologies: (i) extensive farms selling at weaning with low productivity; (ii) extensive farms with low productivity and high dependence on subsidies; (iii) calf-finishing farms with average stocking rates and high profitability; (iv) irrigated farms with low presence <b>of</b> <b>livestock,</b> and high fixed capital and economic fluxes. In general terms, management and structure of dehesa beef cattle farms positioned them in a good place regarding CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) trends (mainly in terms of environmental protection). However, the farms studied must improve several aspects. Firstly, they need to increase their degree of self-reliance (reducing their dependence on external workforce and subsidies). Secondly, their productivity and economic performance must also be increased. The latter could be achieved by adding value to the products being sold, i. e. finishing more calves, developing new products and/or participating in marketing. Generally speaking, a close relationship between farm typologies and the previously established groups of farms (Conventional, Organic 1 and Organic 2) has not been observed. This was due to the similarities between organic and conventional farms in the context of the dehesas with regard to indicators used in the present study...|$|R

We screened 52 sheep breeds from the Eurasian subcontinent with 20 microsatellite markers. By estimating and weighting differently within- and between-breed genetic variation our aims were to identify genetic diversity hotspots and prioritize the importance of each breed for conservation, respectively. In addition we estimated how important within-species diversity hotspots are in livestock conservation. Results Bayesian clustering analysis revealed three genetic clusters, termed Nordic, Composite and Fat-tailed. Southern breeds from close to the region of sheep domestication were more variable, but less genetically differentiated compared with more northern populations. Decreasing weight for within-breed diversity component led to very high representation of genetic clusters or regions containing more diverged breeds, but did not increase phenotypic diversity among the high ranked breeds. Sampling populations throughout 14 regional groups was suggested for maximized total genetic diversity. Conclusions During initial steps <b>of</b> establishing a <b>livestock</b> conservation program populations from the diversity hot-spot area {{are the most important}} ones, but for the full design our results suggested that approximately equal population presentation across environments should be considered. Even in this case, higher per population emphasis in areas of high diversity is appropriate. The analysis was based on neutral data, but {{we have no reason to}} think the general trend is limited to this type of data. However, a comprehensive valuation of populations should balance production systems, phenotypic traits and available genetic information, and include consideration of probability of success. </p...|$|R

40|$|After {{discussing}} {{some general}} problems in measuring sustainability, an <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> measurable {{criteria for the}} major agroecological problems is proposed, derived from explicit issues of unsustainability. The proposed criteria are briefly discussed. Factors which might influence the effect <b>of</b> inclusion <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> in an agricultural system on each criterion are also discussed. It is argued that <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> livestock-specific criteria is impossible {{because of the large}} heterogeneity <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> production systems and the non-linear relation between livestock-specific criteria and agroecological criteria. Therefore, a system-specific analysis is needed to assess the overall effect <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> inclusion in an agricultural system on each of the proposed general criteria for sustainability. These are: demand and supply <b>of</b> consumable <b>livestock</b> products; potential human population supporting capacity; land area utilized for agriculture; degree of equity in food distribution; variability of production; net annual soil losses; nutrient balances and losses; water availability and utilization; soil organic matter; fossil energy and drug utilization.

Little is known of the prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. in humans, domesticated animals or wildlife in Papua New Guinea (PNG). The aim {{of the present study}} was to screen sheep and goats for Cryptosporidium using molecular tools. A total of 504 faecal samples were collected from sheep (n= 276) and goats (n= 228) in village, government and institutional farms in PNG. Samples were screened by nested PCR and genotyped at the 18 S rRNA and at the 60. kDa glycoprotein (gp 60) loci. The overall prevalences were 2. 2 % for sheep (6 / 278) and 4. 4 % (10 / 228) for goats.

Following initial RVF virus laboratory confirmation, a high-throughput RVF diagnostic facility was established at the Kenyan Central Veterinary Laboratories in Kabete, Kenya, to support the real-time <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> infected <b>livestock</b> and to facilitate outbreak response and control activities. A total of 3, 250 specimens {{from a variety of}} animal species, including domesticated livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, and camels) and wildlife collected from a total of 55 of 71 Kenyan administrative districts, were tested by molecular and serologic assays. Evidence of RVF infection was found in 9. 2 % of animals tested and across 23 districts of Kenya, reflecting the large number <b>of</b> affected <b>livestock</b> and the geographic extent of the outbreak. The complete S, M, and/or L genome segment sequence was obtained from a total of 31 RVF virus specimens spanning the entire known outbreak period (December-May) and geographic areas affected by RVF virus activity.
