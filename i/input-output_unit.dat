This {{system can be}} represented by a continuous time Marlmv process with states (m,n). where m and n denote {{the number of jobs}} at the CP and the 10 unit respectively. The computation of the equilibrium distribution {p_{m,n}} of this Markov process is the purpose of the analysis in this paper. The analysis consists of two parts. In the first part, we use a compensation procedure to show that the equilibrium distribution {p_{m,n}} in those states (m,n) for which m+n is not too small, can be expressed as an infinite linear combination of product forms. Explicit formulae are given for the product forms and the coefficients of this infinite linear combination. In {{the second part of the}} analysis, we pay attention to some numerical aspects of the computation of the equilibrium distribution. For the computation of the equilibrium probabilities that can be expressed as infinite linear combinations of product forms, we derive bounds for the errors caused by cutting off these infinite linear combinations, and after that we present numerically stable formulae to compute one by one the remaining equilibrium probabilities.

5000|$|His {{electrophysiological}} {{studies of}} the olfactory bulb in 1963 produced {{one of the first}} examples of a brain microcircuit. Building on this work he collaborated with Wilfrid Rall at NIH to construct the first computational models of brain neurons. This predicted dendrodendritic interactions in the olfactory bulb, subsequently confirmed by electronmicroscopy, hypothesized to mediate lateral inhibition of the sensory input. A collaboration in 1975, using new methods of brain imaging, revealed that odors are encoded by different spatial activity patterns in the olfactory glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. This showed that the neural basis of smell in virtually all vertebrates involves odor representation by glomerular activity patterns ("odor images") which are then processed by lateral inhibition mediated by the dendrodendritic circuits. Shepherd's lab continued to use the olfactory bulb as a general model for the integrative actions of neuronal dendrites. This showed that dendrites contain multiple computational units; backpropagating action potentials in dendrites carry out specific functional operations; and dendritic spines can function as semi-independent <b>input-output</b> <b>units.</b> The lab also provided a basic circuit for olfactory cortex.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{focuses on}} {{evolving}} of two types fuzzy and classical PID liquid level controller and examining {{whether they are}} better able to handle modelling uncertainties. A two stage strategy is employed to design the synthesis fuzzy and classical PID controller with the process of the first and second order and implements disorder (quadratic function). Design/methodology/approach: The synthesis of fuzzy and classical PID liquid level controller was realized with the HP laptop 6830 s Compaq NA 779 ES, software Matlab/Simulink 2008 b, FIS (Fuzzy Inference System) soft logical tool, <b>input-output</b> <b>unit</b> 500 Dragon Rider and ultrasonic sensor. Using the simulation program Matlab/Simulink/FIS we simulate the operation of fuzzy and classical controller in the liquid level regulating cycle and made a comparison between fuzzy and classical controller functioning. Findings: From the responses to step fuzzy and classical controller for first-order process shows that the actual value of the controlled variable takes the value one. Fuzzy and classical PID controller does not allow control derogation, which is also inappropriate for fuzzy and classical control cycle with incorporating disturbance. Classical PID controller in the first-order process provides short-term regulation, such as fuzzy PID controller. In fuzzy control cycle with fuzzy PID controller and incorporating disturbance in the process of second-order the control cycle is stable and at certain predetermined parameters (integral gain) a control does not allow deviations. Research limitations/implications: In future research, the robustness of the fuzzy logic controller will be investigated in more details. Practical implications: Using fuzzy liquid level controller can reduce power consumption by 25 %. Originality/value: Fuzzy logic controller is useful in applications of nonlinear static characteristic, where classical methods with usually classical PID controllers cannot be a satisfactory outcom...|$|E
40|$|Green {{accounts}} or input–output {{accounting systems}} (IOA) {{have been developed}} in countries with intensive agricultural production to facilitate voluntary improvements in farm environmental performance. There {{is a need for}} an overview of indicators used and a review of results and experiences reported. Ten IOA systems covering the topics of the farm’s use of nutrients, pesticides and energy were selected from a survey of 55 systems and compared in this paper. The approaches and indicators used vary from systems based on good agricultural practices (GAP) to accounts based systems that use physical <b>input–output</b> <b>units.</b> Many IOA systems use farm gate nutrient balances, pesticide use per hectare and energy use per kilogram product. These indicators are easy to calculate but the resulting value needs separate interpretation for the farmer. Other systems include modeled emissions and rate the yearly farm results using closed scales, which allows for easy interpretation but builds on implicit normative assumptions of best practices. Participating farmers were most often reported to be motivated for the use of IOA but empirical evidence of improved environmental farm performance was scarce. IOA systems should be linked with production planning tools used by the advisory services. Farmers and advisors needs better reference values to evaluate the indicator levels (environmental performance) on the individual farm possibly based on analysis of a larger number of farms. The statistical properties of IOA indicators need to be researched regarding: (1) the relation between changed management practice and changes in indicator values on a given farm over a period of time; (2) the relative importance of systematic versu...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the static and dynamic stability analysis of rack or frame computer/server products during shipping and relocation. The static stability {{is the ability}} of server products to resist tipping over on a typical raised floor in a datacenter or when it is installed in its operational product environment. The dynamic stability is the ability to resist tipping over when a velocity change occurs during re-location either on flat or inclined planes. The product consists of a frame or a rack in which components such as processor <b>units,</b> <b>input-output</b> <b>units</b> and power supplies are installed. The static stability analysis presented here calculates the tip over threshold angle, which is the maximum angle of an inclined plane on which the product can be placed without tipping over. The location of the installed components in a frame, the dimension and weight of the installed components, and the dimension of the product dictate the overall static stability of the product. Specifically, those parameters affect the location of the center of gravity of the product and the tip over threshold angle. The tip over threshold angle is a critical parameter influencing the dynamic stability of the product [...] The dynamic stability of an unpackaged product moving on casters can be calculated using the conservation of mechanical energy principle. Finite element modeling {{is a good way to}} evaluate the dynamic stability of a product during manual handling or mechanical handling; for instance, on a forklift.

Electronical systems (platforms) which are often used for playing video games are the PCs, game consoles and most recently for this purpose are using mobile phones. In terms of video games, they differ mutually, primarily by the way of interaction and <b>input-output</b> <b>units</b> that they use. In computers as input units for managing with video-games mostly are used mouse, keyboard, joystick or steering wheel, separately or in combination, and in consoles are used game controllers. Initially, computer video-games were designed mostly for fun, and it has remained their dominant purpose till today. Depending on variety of factors such as: way of play, game purposes and others, video games can be categorized in more genres such as: strategically, action, adventurous and etc. Although, there are hypothesis that video games have negative effect on children social development, {{and that they are}} reason for some diseases related to loco motor and perceptual system, still {{in the past few years}} we are encountering with contra-thesis that video games can be used in educative purposes, but also to contribute for the psycho-motorist children development. The purpose of this master`s work is to explore the impact of video games (especially through simulated ball games) at children of pre-school age and their effect in their motorist and psychological development. Ball games are characterized with perceptual insecureness and timing pressure. These characteristics together make the action of hitting and catching the ball difficult and determine the nature of visual strategies which the player should undertake. In many cases the most difficultness in fast ball games is that sum of time reaction and time movement exceeds the time of flight of the ball. From special interest in such games are visual strategies, when these characteristics are changeable.

The saturating and binary models also exhibit spatially modulated retrieval states if the highest activity level that they can achieve is above the maximum activity of the units in the stored patterns. In the zero quenched noise limit, we derive an analytical formula for the critical value of the connectivity width below which one observes spatially non-uniform retrieval states. Localization reduces storage capacity, but only by a factor of 2 ~ 3.

30|$|Input/output (I/O) {{attacks have}} {{received}} increasing attention {{during the last}} decade. These attacks are performed by malicious peripherals that make read or write accesses to DRAM memory or to memory embedded in other peripherals, through DMA (Direct Memory Access) requests. Some protection mechanisms have been implemented in modern architectures to face these attacks. A typical example is the IOMMU (<b>Input-Output</b> Memory Management <b>Unit).</b> However, such mechanisms may not be properly configured and used by the firmware and the operating system. This paper describes a design weakness that we discovered in the configuration of an IOMMU and a possible exploitation scenario that would allow a malicious peripheral to bypass the underlying protection mechanism. The exploitation scenario is implemented for Intel architectures, with a PCI Express peripheral Field Programmable Gate Array, based on Intel specifications and Linux source code analysis.

50|$|Another {{consideration}} is the data model used for device drivers. Drivers {{make up the}} majority of the operating system code in most modern operating systems (although many may not be loaded when the operating system is running). Many drivers use pointers heavily to manipulate data, and in some cases have to load pointers of a certain size into the hardware they support for direct memory access (DMA). As an example, a driver for a 32-bit PCI device asking the device to DMA data into upper areas of a 64-bit machine's memory could not satisfy requests from the operating system to load data from the device to memory above the 4 gibibyte barrier, because the pointers for those addresses would not fit into the DMA registers of the device. This problem is solved by having the OS take the memory restrictions of the device into account when generating requests to drivers for DMA, or by using an <b>input-output</b> memory management <b>unit</b> (IOMMU).|$|R

This goal has been challenged by many factors inuencing energy prices and costs such as developments in global energy markets, the EU ETS and the promotion of renewables.

However, it does not allow for monitoring the burden which energy costs pose on firms. For this purpose, both the European Commission and the Energy Expert Commission of the German Government recommend using real unit energy costs, defined as energy costs as fraction of value added.

40|$|Proponents of {{financial}} liberalization argue that deregulation motivates bankers {{to increase their}} effort and operate {{at a higher level}} of efficiency and productivity. Sceptics, however, see that liberalization engenders economic instability and banking crises, and impedes growth. Bank efficiency and productivity, following liberalization, is extensively examined. Nonetheless, the core issue of bankers’ self-motivation remains implicitly assumed and unaddressed. Does liberalization self-motivate bankers and increase their efforts and productivity? This paper models bank productivity from this perspective and evaluates what proportion of banks’ total factor productivity is accounted for by the self-motivated productivity of bankers. We provide a micro-founded framework for the analyses of bankers’ optimal level of effort and effort-driven productivity. Our model also captures banks’ <b>unit</b> <b>input-output</b> prices, optimal wages, bank spread and the overall cost of bank services – measures that are important in evaluating reform policies. We assess the financial liberalization of Nepal as a test case and find that (i) bankers’ efforts and productivity have notably improved in Nepal, although banking services have become costly, and (ii) bank spread has moderately declined in recent years. Our approach is parametric which differs from DEA, hence complements the literature. We hope this analytical framework will be useful to evaluate reform episodes elsewhere...|$|R

The aim of the presented algorithm {{is to find the}} optimal hydrothermal scheduling with a detailed representation of the hydroelectric system (cascaded reservoirs, head dependent <b>units,</b> <b>input-output</b> surfaces, water rights and minimum-maximum operating outflows). Besides hydro and thermal generators, pumped storage units are considered using composite energy representation. The proposed algorithm can be divided in three steps. Firstly, the global problem is solved but relaxing the commitment decisions and grouping consecutive hours within periods up to 4 hours. This phase allows to quickly reach a good initial solution thanks to the particular structure of the problem when applied to real input data. The second step uses hourly periods but thermal unit-commitment decisions are still relaxed. After that, electrical power produced at each hydro plant is computed using the current water discharged and the input-output curve corresponding to the net head obtained in the last execution. Finally, after fixing the hydro generation obtained in the previous step, commitment and output power of thermal units are obtained by mixed integer linear programming. The proposed method has been applied to real scale study cases with excellent results in computational time as well as in mismatches from the global optimal solution. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

Thefirst network consists of ten feedforward levels where a Poisson spiketrain with varying firing rate is applied as an input in layerone. Although the balanced state partially avoids spikesynchronization during the transmission, the average firing-rate in the last layer either decays or saturates depending on the feedforwardpathway gain. The last layer activity is almost independent of the inputeven for a carefully chosen intermediate gain. Adding connectionsto the feedforward pathway by a nine areas Pulvinar structure improves the firing-rate propagation to become almost linear amonglayers. Incoming strong pulvinar spikes balance the low feedforwardgain to have a <b>unit</b> <b>input-output</b> relation in the last layer.

Here,the uncorrelated incoming feedforward pathway washes out thesynchronized thalamic bursts. In the second regime, spikes in the wholenetwork are asynchronous.

40|$|Neuronal {{activity}} in {{the central nervous system}} varies strongly in time and across neuronal populations. It is a longstanding proposal that such fluctuations generically arise from chaotic network dynamics. Various theoretical studies predict that the rich dynamics of rate models operating in the chaotic regime can subserve circuit computation and learning. Neurons in the brain, however, communicate via spikes and it is a theoretical challenge to obtain similar rate fluctuations in networks of spiking neuron models. A recent study investigated spiking balanced networks of leaky integrate and fire (LIF) neurons and compared their dynamics to a matched rate network with identical topology, where single <b>unit</b> <b>input-output</b> functions were chosen from isolated LIF neurons receiving Gaussian white noise input. A mathematical analogy between the chaotic instability in networks of rate units and the spiking network dynamics was proposed. Here we revisit the behavior of the spiking LIF networks and these matched rate networks. We find expected hallmarks of a chaotic instability in the rate network: For supercritical coupling strength near the transition point, the autocorrelation time diverges. For subcritical coupling strengths, we observe critical slowing down in response to small external perturbations. In the spiking network, we found in contrast that the timescale of the autocorrelations is insensitive to the coupling strength and that rate deviations resulting from small input perturbations rapidly decay. The decay speed even accelerates for increasing coupling strength. In conclusion, our reanalysis demonstrates fundamental differences between the behavior of pulse-coupled spiking LIF networks and rate networks with matched topology and input-output function. In particular there is no indication of a corresponding chaotic instability in the spiking network...|$|R
