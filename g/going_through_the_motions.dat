5000|$|The Popeye was {{a popular}} dance in the dance craze era of the late 1950s and early 1960s.

[...] However, she noticed that the [...] "shift in the power structure [...] more blatant than on '4 Minutes', where Madonna sounds like a featured guest trying to keep pace with Timbaland's colossal beats and Timberlake's nimble melody."

The match, known as 'the Bloodbath', was notorious for its onfield violence. For his part, Nash king-hit Carlton captain Bob Chitty in the final quarter with what he later {{described}} as the sweetest punch he had ever thrown, knocking Chitty out, breaking his jaw and leaving a large wound over his left eye which required several stitches; as the umpire was unsighted, Nash went unreported over this incident. Nash was generally ineffective on the day, and his opponent Vin Brown was a consensus pick for best player on ground.

500|$|... "New York" [...] was {{met with}} mixed reviews by many critics. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "We didn't {{actually}} expect the New Directions to win nationals, but the episode just {{felt like it was}} <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> rather than seizing the opportunity to do something truly spectacular." [...] The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff called the episode a [...] "good piece of television", and gave it a [...] "B+". He said it [...] "wasn't as good" [...] as the first-season finale, [...] "Journey to Regionals", [...] "largely because it wasted {{a lot of time on}} performances designed solely to show off how the show was actually in New York and also because it borrowed a lot of that episode's set pieces without finding anything remotely as powerful as the performance of 'Bohemian Rhapsody. Robert Canning of IGN gave [...] "New York" [...] a [...] "good" [...] grade of 7.5 out of 10 and stated, [...] "while not as epic as Nationals in New York should have been, 'New York' was a decent close to an enjoyable season." [...] The Atlantic Meghan Brown said the episode was [...] "an uneven end to an uneven season, with a few killer numbers, strange resolutions, and head-scratching plot devices", while her colleague Kevin Fallon opined that the season finale was [...] "no exception" [...] to Glee having [...] "been undeniably frustrating in season two", though [...] "there was still ample reason to tune in and enjoy".|$|E

500|$|After the film's release, the American humor {{magazine}} The National Lampoon {{ran a story}} {{written by}} mordant humorist Michael O'Donoghue and drawn in a parody of Crumb's style called [...] "Fritz the Star in 'Kitty Glitter'" [...] portraying the Fritz character as a jaded and complacent Hollywood star <b>going</b> <b>through</b> all <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of celebrities of the day, going on talk shows and mouthing vaguely liberal platitudes before cynically guiding the conversation over to promotion of whatever his next movie would be. The strip ends with a nightmarish full-page vista of [...] "Crumbland" [...] where all of Crumb's countercultural icons have been turned into commercial commodities.

50|$|In all situations, the {{requirement}} of formality is thought {{to improve the quality}} of people's consent. It has been reasoned, most notably by Lon Fuller, that <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> laborious <b>motions</b> of formality induces people to truly consider whether they wish to make a transfer. It also provides evidence of the transaction, and makes the threshold of a transaction's enforceability simple to determine. This is most seen in the case of a contract. If an interest in land is the subject of a contract, the law isolates three steps. First, the sale will take place, which according to LPMPA 1989 section 2 may only occur with signed writing (though by section 2(5) and Law of Property Act 1925 section 54(2) leases under 3 years can be made without). Second, technically the transfer must take place under Law of Property Act 1925 section 52(1) by a deed (though there is no reason why this cannot be combined with step 1, by using a deed for the sale!). Third, the land must be registered for the legal interest to take effect under LRA 2002 sections 27 to 30.|$|R
500|$|Kenneth Silber from Space.com {{was very}} {{negative}} towards the episode, saying, [...] "This episode conveys {{a strong sense}} of a writer, director and actors merely <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions,</b> collecting their sizable paychecks while running out the clock on the season and series. The plot is not compelling, the agents themselves seem not to take it seriously, and the doppelgangers around whom the action revolves are little more than ciphers." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two wrote, [...] "'Fight Club' is a marker for a series that seems to want to die now, please. [...] it's tonally one of the most atypical episodes the series ever made, conceived in spite and self-loathing and sheer exhaustion." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four. Vitaris criticized the use of Kathy Griffin and asserted, [...] "the guest cast {{is one of the worst}} ever. [...] Griffin [...] simply is not up to the task; she can not differentiate Betty and Lulu at all [...] and she reads every line as if she were still on her cancelled sitcom." [...] i09 reviewer Cyriaque Lama named [...] "The Kathy Griffin Twins" [...] the tenth [...] "Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters of the Week", and derided her performance as the Templeton twins. In 2016, in a ranking of all episodes of the series from best to worst, Vulture.com named [...] "Fight Club" [...] the worst episode of the series.|$|E
2500|$|Reaction to {{the album}} {{at the time}} was mixed, with some former fans {{disappointed}} at the new commercial direction. In the UK NME complained that [...] "there's a feeling of <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> on many of the songs, playing out scenes and sending up manners and mores in an almost identikit fashion. Perhaps the most disappointing thing about this LP is the lack of vision and imagination in Darnell's songwriting... Tropical Gangsters doesn't exactly stink, but there is a mighty stale whiff about it." [...] However, Melody Maker was more positive, saying, [...] "Gone is the musical exotica of Fresh Fruit..., the last LP, {{to be replaced by a}} leaner, harder sound, characterised by an emphasis on percussion and rhythm guitar... Far from being a collection of 'dull, insipid disco songs', as Sounds would have it, this album is packed with wit, humour, tunes and a clear sense of direction." ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{particular}} session will {{be remembered}} for some of the worst bowling ever witnessed by England fans. [...] The attack was blatantly tired (from 2+ days in the field) but displayed their lack of fitness by still being tired even after 2 days off (rest days on Sundays were still the case in 1989). [...] The Australian batsmen scored at over a run a ball that morning as Gower was left with 3 bowlers. [...] In his autobiography, Gower remarked how bad a game Newport had had such that he was allowed only 5 overs (which cost 22 runs) in the second innings. [...] It should also be remembered that the chance of victory for Australia was slim at best - declaring only around an hour before lunch to take ten wickets. [...] The England bowlers were therefore demotivated by the feeling of <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> during that hour and the result was the fast scoring which firmly ensured there could be only one winner.|$|E

[...] Vik Bansal of musicOMH compared Evanescence's own song [...] "Going Under" [...] with [...] "Bring Me to Life", noting their similarity to Linkin Park's material. Lee said, during an interview with MTV News: [...] "Basically, we go through life every day, kind of doing the same thing, <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions,</b> and nothing fazes us for the most part.

2500|$|Upon its release, Just Whitney {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with aggregated reviews on Metacritic awarding the album 53 out of 100. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic commented that Just Whitney was [...] "an assertion that she 's {{returning to her}} basics." [...] He {{also said that the}} album was a measured attempt to salvage a career that's on the verge of destruction. He concluded by saying, [...] "It would be a good standard-issue Whitney album if it wasn't for her disarming, defensive attempt to defuse every rumor hurled in her direction." [...] Billboard reviewed the album commenting that [...] "Just Whitney appears and sounds more like a work-in-progress than a finished disk" [...] and said that the album showcased an artist simply <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> and her voice lacked emotion and verve." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today graded the album two-and-half stars out of four, giving a mixed review saying, [...] "At her best, Houston is full of sass and attitude and, most of all, joy. But with so much emphasis on what's bothering her, you can't help but wonder whether the thrill is gone." [...] According to The Guardian, the album takes [...] "a musical step backwards".|$|E
2500|$|Before I Self Destruct has {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 62, based on 15 reviews. Allmusic called it [...] "a fantastic juggernaut of a 50 album if you exit early, {{and a very}} good one even if you don't". Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Growling violent threats over hard beats, 50 sounds the hungriest he has in years. Of course, there’s nothing remotely original about the formula he’s returning to, but at least he’s <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> with gusto". The A.V. Club said that, [...] "If Destruct qualifies as a pleasant surprise, it’s only because 50 Cent’s last few releases set the bar so low. Still, {{for the first time since}} The Massacre, it’s once again intermittently fun to root for the bad guy" [...] Pitchfork Media wrote that, [...] "After initially promising a return to form, 50 doesn't have the ability or initiative to hold the listener's interest over the long run." [...] PopMatters said that, [...] "With surprisingly little filler, renewed energy, and the unique glimpse Before I Self Destruct offers into the psyche of a public figure as intriguing as Curtis Jackson, 50 Cent has crafted easily his best album since [...] "Get Rich or Die Trying." ...|$|E

During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone said something to me— I didn’t know him, and I {{thought he might be}} clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who was a friend of a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. And {{he looked at me and}} said, ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant.

2500|$|Davey Wreden, 22 {{years old}} at the time of the modification's release, was {{inspired}} to create The Stanley Parable about three years prior, after considering the typical storytelling narratives within video games, and thought of what would happen if the player would go against that narration; Wreden also saw this as a means towards his planned career as a game developer. As a video game player, Wreden has found that most major triple-A titles at the time make numerous assumptions about the player's experience and fitting that within the game, and don't provide answers for [...] "what if" [...] questions that the player may consider. Wreden considered that more recent games with more engaging or thought-provoking stories, including the Metal Gear Solid series, Half-Life 2, Portal, Braid, and BioShock, started to approach this void, giving reason for the player to stop and think about the narration instead of simply <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions.</b> Though his initial intent was a personal project simply to try to make such a game that asked the questions about why people play video games, he found that there were other gamers that had been considering the same type of questions.
