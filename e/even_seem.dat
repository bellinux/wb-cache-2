He also believed to have stayed and chanted in a cave with a notorious snake, however, seemed unaffected by all of this. He did not <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> {{to be aware of}} the snake's presence.|$|E
25|$|The Greeks in India <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> to {{have played}} {{an active role in}} the {{propagation}} of Buddhism, as some of the emissaries of Ashoka such as Dharmaraksita, or the teacher Mahadharmaraksita, are described in Pali sources as leading Greek ("Yona", i.e., Ionian) Buddhist monks, active in Buddhist proselytism (the Mahavamsa, XII). It is also thought that Greeks contributed to the sculptural work of the Pillars of Ashoka, and more generally to the blossoming of Mauryan art. Some Greeks (Yavanas) may have played an administrative role in the territories ruled by Ashoka: the Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman records that during the rule of Ashoka, a Yavana King/ Governor named Tushaspha was in charge in the area of Girnar, Gujarat, mentioning his role in the construction of a water reservoir.|$|E

25|$|This last {{printing}} {{may have}} consisted of several printing runs or perhaps was contracted out to different printers. While no deliberate {{changes to the}} text block have been noted, the binding cloth and the text block's paper stock both changed at times, and flaws developed in the printing plates over time. One of the cloth variants {{is similar to the}} first printing's, but even yellower. Another shows an even weave with light, very even oatmeal coloring that can <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> faintly pink in some light. Its cloth shows deep, vivid blues in the lettering, whereas the others look obviously paler. Yet another variant carries a variegated linen-like weave wherein individual threads can stand out for several centimeters. This latter is as dark as the binding of the third printing (while lacking the yellow cast), but the coloring is so uneven that it might be mistaken as soiled even when clean. Soiling on the other variants, on the other hand, is immediately apparent.|$|E
500|$|Some {{opposition}} from neighborhood residents originated from concerns with increased congestion. Donald Trump immediately voiced {{opposition to the}} building, stating that the tall structure would be a target for terrorists and did not <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> {{to be a viable}} project. [...] The opposing comment by Trump was made while he himself was developing a supertall tower in Chicago, the Trump International Hotel and Tower. Trump's tower completed construction in January 2009, just a few blocks west of the Chicago Spire site. If the Chicago Spire had been built as planned, it would have replaced the Trump International Hotel and Tower as the tallest residential structure in the United States, and the two towers would have been in direct competition in selling residential units.|$|E
500|$|Cooper was a {{conservative}} Republican like his father, and voted for Calvin Coolidge in 1924, Herbert Hoover in 1928 and 1932, and campaigned for Wendell Willkie in 1940. When Franklin D. Roosevelt ran for an unprecedented fourth presidential term in 1944, Cooper campaigned for Thomas E. Dewey and criticized Roosevelt for being dishonest and adopting [...] "foreign" [...] ideas. In a radio address that {{he paid for}} himself {{just prior to the}} election, Cooper said, [...] "I disagree with the New Deal belief that the America all of us love is old and worn-out and finished—and has to borrow foreign notions that don't <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> to work any too well where they come from ... Our country is a young country that just has to make up its mind to be itself again." [...] He also attended a Republican rally at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum that drew 93,000 Dewey supporters.|$|E

It was really fun, but you'll see if you ever come to a video shoot of mine one day– I'm very private about those things, I don't really talk to everybody. I'm not like the party girl running around. I might <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> to {{be a bit of a}} diva. I'm sort of with myself, in my work head space worrying about costumes, and if extras look right, and placement. I don't just show up for things, you know. That video was a vision of mine. It was Melina the director who wanted to do something, to have a performance art aspect that was so pop but it was still commercial, but that felt like lifestyle. It was all those things, I love it." ...|$|E

[...] Vincent Canby of The New York Times, gave the film a {{negative}} review, writing, [...] "There are times when the director doesn't <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> {{to know where to}} put the camera. Scenes unravel without dramatic point. No amount of breathless editing and fancy graphics can disguise the amateur nature of the enterprise." [...] In The Philadelphia Inquirer, Roger E. Hernandez criticized the film for its portrayal of Cubans. Hernandez wrote, [...] "The main problem here was the accents. The characters were supposed to be Cuban, but, with the exception of salsa star Celia Cruz, none sounded it." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times criticized Glimcher's direction, writing in his review, [...] "...when it comes to directing dramatic sequences, he is on his own and lacking in resources to make what drama there is come to a coherent or meaningful point." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{book would}} be Triplanetary, [...] "in which {{scientific}} detail {{would not be}} bothered about, and in which his imagination would run riot." [...] Indeed, characters within the story point out its psychological and scientific implausibilities, and sometimes <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> to suggest self-parody. At other times, they are conspicuously silent about obvious implausibilities. The January 1933 issue of Astounding announced that Triplanetary would appear in the March issue, and that issue's cover illustrated {{a scene from the}} story, but Astoundings financial difficulties prevented the story from appearing. Smith then submitted the manuscript to Wonder Stories, whose new editor, 17-year-old Charles D. Hornig, rejected it, later boasting about the rejection in a fanzine. He finally submitted it to Amazing, which published it beginning in January 1934, but for only half a cent a word. Shortly after it was accepted, F. Orlin Tremaine, the new editor of the revived Astounding, offered one cent a word for Triplanetary; when he learned that he was too late, he suggested a third Skylark novel instead.|$|E
2500|$|Miletski {{believes}} that [...] "Animals {{are capable of}} sexual consent – and even initiation – in their own way." [...] It is not an uncommon practice for dogs to attempt to copulate with ("hump") the legs of people of both genders. Rosenberger (1968) emphasizes {{that as far as}} cunnilingus is concerned, dogs require no training, and even Dekkers (1994) and Menninger (1951) admit that sometimes animals take the initiative and do so impulsively. Those supporting zoophilic activity feel animals sometimes <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> to enjoy the sexual attention or voluntarily initiate sexual activity with humans. Animals such as dogs can be willing participants in sexual activity with humans, and [...] "seem to enjoy the attention provided by the sexual interaction with a human." [...] Animal owners normally know what their own pets like or do not like. Most people can tell if an animal does not like how it is being petted, because it will move away. An animal that is liking being petted pushes against the hand, and seems to enjoy it. To those defending bestiality this is seen as a way in which animals give consent, or the fact that a dog might wag its tail.|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{reviews of}} the book ranged from very {{positive}} to very negative. There were positive reviews from The Nation, ("the best novel {{to come out in}} years"), the New York Herald Tribune ("A wild, moving, shocking, hilarious, raging, exhilarating, giant roller-coaster of a book") and The New York Times ("A dazzling performance that will outrage nearly as many readers as it delights"). On the other hand, The New Yorker, ("doesn't <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> to be written; instead, it gives the impression of having been shouted onto paper", [...] "what remains is a debris of sour jokes") and a second review from the New York Times ("repetitive and monotonous. Or one can say that it is too short because none of its many interesting characters and actions is given enough play to become a controlling interest") disliked it. One commentator of Catch-22 recognized that [...] "many early audiences liked the book for just the same reasons that caused others to hate it" [...] The book had a cult following though, especially among teenagers and college students. Heller remarks that in 1962, after appearing on the Today show he went out drinking with the host at the time, John Chancellor, who handed him stickers that Chancellor got privately printed reading [...] "YOSSARIAN LIVES". Heller also said that Chancellor had been secretly putting them {{on the walls of the}} corridors and executive bathrooms in the NBC building.|$|E

2500|$|The GULAG was an {{administration}} body that watched over the camps; eventually its name {{would be used}} for these camps retrospectively. [...] After Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin was able {{to take control of the}} government, and began to form the gulag system. [...] On June 27, 1929 the Politburo created a system of self-supporting camps that would eventually replace the existing prisons around the country. These prisons were meant to receive inmates that received a prison sentence that exceeded three years. [...] Prisoners that had a shorter prison sentence than three years were to remain in the prison system that was still under the purview of the NKVD. [...] The purpose of these new camps was to colonize the remote and inhospitable environments throughout the Soviet Union. These changes took place around the same time that Stalin started to institute collectivization and rapid industrial development. Collectivization resulted in a large scale purge of peasants and so-called Kulaks. The Kulaks were supposedly wealthy (comparatively to other Soviet peasants) and were considered to be capitalists by the state, and by extension enemies of socialism. By late 1929 Stalin started a program known as [...] "dekulakization". Stalin demanded that the kulak class be completely wiped out. This resulted in the imprisonment and execution of Soviet peasants. The term [...] "Kulak" [...] would also become associated with anyone who opposed or <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> unsatisfied with the Soviet government. This resulted in 60,000 people being sent to the camps and another 154,000 exiled in a mere four months. This was only the beginning of the dekulakization process. In 1931 alone 1,803,392 people were exiled. Although these massive relocation processes were successful in getting a large potential free forced labor work force where they needed to be, that is about all it was successful at doing. [...] The [...] "special settlers", as the Soviet government referred to them, all lived on starvation level rations, and many people starved to death in the camps, and anyone who was healthy enough to escape tried to do just that. This resulted in the government having to give rations to a group of people they were getting hardly any use out of, and was just costing the Soviet government money. The Unified State Political Administration (OGPU) quickly realized the problem, and began to reform the dekulakization process. To help prevent the mass escapes the OGPU started to recruit people within the colony to help stop people who attempted to leave, and set up ambushes around known popular escape routes. The OGPU also attempted to raise the living conditions in these camps that would not encourage people to actively try and escape, and Kulaks were promised that they would regain their rights after five years. Even these revisions ultimately failed to resolve the problem, and the dekulakization process was a failure in providing the government with a steady forced labor force. These prisoners were also lucky to be in the gulag in the early 1930s. Prisoners were relatively well off compared to what the prisoners would have to go through in the final years of the gulag.|$|E
