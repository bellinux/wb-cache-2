Johannesburg, 2012 Campaigns to educate people on how to use and manage energy responsibly are on the agenda of energy producers, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO) and the government of South Africa. Until recently, publications on energy conservation programmes to inform these groups on best practice have been non-existent. This paper reports on an energy conservation programme, “Energy Dialogues” primarily aimed at offering information as well as influencing pro-environmental attitudes and consequently the behaviour of grade 11 learners in the Gauteng province of South Africa. The <b>Energy</b> <b>Dialogues</b> was conducted in a non-formal learning environment. Learners on the programme were challenged to propose various forms of ‘action taking’ to promote <b>Energy</b> <b>Dialogues</b> amongst their peers, in their school, at home, and in their community. Seven out of twenty schools met the challenge. The research project captured the social interaction among learners during the “Energy Dialogues” programme. A survey confirmed that learners still possess alternative ideas with regards to energy use and management after classroom instruction. While learners have significant knowledge of the causes and consequences of poor energy usage, this does not translate into change in behaviour. Creating an environment of group learning may influence the learners’ lifestyle choices. Learners are more inclined to align themselves with the values of a group. An active learning framework of the <b>Energy</b> <b>Dialogues</b> gave learners an opportunity to take personal responsibility for the environment. They redefined their culture, physically engaged in activity and spoke the language of the educator. While the learners’ visit to DEC was a one-time occurrence, and the findings cannot be generalised, this study may inform future longitudinal research which would offer information of the causal relationships of the components influencing sustainable practices...|$|R

40|$|The EU-Russia <b>Energy</b> <b>Dialogue</b> was {{launched}} in October 2000. Its goal was a binding energy agreement between Russia and the European Union, and possibly a wider political partnership. Today, however, the <b>Energy</b> <b>Dialogue</b> seems all but forgotten. How and why did the EU-Russia <b>Energy</b> <b>Dialogue</b> fail to define and create a legally binding energy partnership? There is scant literature about the <b>Energy</b> <b>Dialogue.</b> To the limited extent that the literature addresses the failure, it identifies either ideational, political, economic, geo- economic or institutional variables. But this separation is artificial. To bridge this divide I have developed a novel analytical framework using narratives and Bakhtin’s theory of dialogue. In this respect, the thesis is ideational or constructivist. However, unlike conventional constructivist accounts, which tend to downplay politics, this account emphasises power and conflict: Not dialogue as dual meaning, but many meanings, or ‘heterologue’. Narratives, as opposed to variables, are always in flux. To answer the how question: The dialogue failed because it could not forge a common narrative for the EU-Russia energy trade. Russia sought investment, whereas the EU wanted legal reform. Yet, the <b>Energy</b> <b>Dialogue</b> was a heterologue of conflicting narratives, both between and within Russia and the EU. I have coined six narrative clusters, used as Weberian ideal types: The ‘EUropean’, ‘EU 15 / 25 / 27 ’, ‘Euro-Asian’, ‘Dual State’, ‘Statist’ and ‘Post-Imperial’ narratives. To answer the why question: Narratives unfold in time-space, and the initial misgivings were exacerbated by pre-existing narrative divergences (chapter 1), but also by subsequent political (chapter 2), business (chapter 3), geo-economic (chapter 4) and legal developments (chapter 5) – all influenced by the ebbs and flows of world oil prices. Thus, {{the failure of the}} <b>Energy</b> <b>Dialogue</b> was never pre-determined, or caused by a singular factor or event. It was shaped in the multidimensional, unfolding time-space of Russo-European relations. This thesis is not currently available on ORA...|$|E
40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{the development of}} EU — Russia energy relations {{through the lens of}} the evolution of three parameters: the political agenda (the <b>Energy</b> <b>Dialogue),</b> the institutional structure, and the legal modalities. The identification of these three aspects for assessing the evolution of EU — Russia energy relations is the novelty in the author’s approach. This study aims to identify the previous stages and assess the current state of EU — Russia <b>energy</b> <b>dialogue,</b> since they set out conditions for energy cooperation in the Baltic Sea region. This research is based on a political and legal analysis of various documents and employs various international relations theories (including integration theories). The article demonstrates that the EU nd Russia have made a transition to the integration agenda manifested in the <b>Energy</b> <b>Dialogue</b> (its current goal is the creation of a common European energy market). The author describes the process of gradual consolidation of transgovernmental and transnational institutions, which leads to depoliticization of cooperation and mutual socialization of the partners. Finally, legal discussions on the development of common rules have become more constructive. In sum, the current situation in EU — Russia energy relations is favourable and positively affects cooperation in the Baltic Sea region. ...|$|E
