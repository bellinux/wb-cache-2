50|$|IOR (International Offshore Racing) {{boats in}} the 1970s and 1980s were known for <b>Death</b> <b>Rolls</b> due to their small mains that made them {{unbalanced}} downwind.

The <b>Death</b> <b>Roll</b> often results in destruction of the spinnaker pole and sometimes even dismasting of the boat.
