5|$|As the {{consultant}} {{talks with the}} residents of the town and investigates its history, the backstory of his injury is gradually revealed. After repeatedly stubbing <b>his</b> <b>toe</b> and covering it up with Apex bandages, {{the consultant}} accidentally stepped into pig feces during a company team retreat. Because of the colored bandage, he never discovered how <b>his</b> <b>toe</b> was badly infected, and fainted on the sidewalk after fleeing from an awards party. This led to the amputation of <b>his</b> <b>toe,</b> his departure from the nomenclature firm, and the beginning of his hermetic lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Back in the present, Chandler apologizes to Monica. Rachel reveals that's not {{the story}} she was {{referring}} to. The flashbacks continue to 1988; Ross and Chandler arrive for dinner {{to find that}} Monica has slimmed down, and Chandler now finds her attractive. Monica tells Rachel {{that she wants to}} humiliate Chandler for calling her fat, so Rachel suggests tricking him into taking off his clothes. Monica tries to seduce Chandler by rubbing various objects, including a knife, against her skin. She drops the knife and severs <b>his</b> <b>toe.</b> He is rushed to hospital to have it reattached but, in the commotion, Monica mixes up the digit with a carrot. In the present, Chandler becomes upset after learning that he had lost <b>his</b> <b>toe</b> because he called Monica fat, and angrily leaves. When Monica comes by his apartment seeking his forgiveness by putting a turkey on her head, he inadvertently tells her he loves {{her for the first time}} in their relationship. A tag scene shows another of Phoebe's past life memories as she serves in a World War I field hospital and again lost an arm.|$|E
5|$|In July 1977, Marley {{was found}} to have a type of {{malignant}} melanoma under the nail of a toe. Contrary to urban legend, this lesion was not primarily caused by an injury during a football match that year, but was instead a symptom of the already-existing cancer. Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have <b>his</b> <b>toe</b> amputated (which would have hindered his performing career), citing his religious beliefs, and instead the nail and nail bed were removed and a skin graft taken from his thigh to cover the area. Despite his illness, he continued touring and {{was in the process of}} scheduling a world tour in 1980.|$|E

5|$|Back, leg, {{and neck}} {{injuries}} {{began to take}} a toll on Van Buren in 1950, and his production dropped. He broke <b>his</b> <b>toe</b> in the 1950 off-season and suffered from bone spurs, which caused him to miss the team's four preseason exhibition games and regular season opener. He returned to lead the league in carries for the fourth straight season, but lost the rushing title {{for the first time}} in four years and had career-lows in touchdowns and yards per carry. The Eagles finished with a 6–6 regular season record. Greasy Neale was fired by the Eagles the following February and replaced by Bo McMillin. In 1951, Van Buren played alongside his brother, halfback and linebacker Ebert, whom the Eagles selected in that year's draft out of LSU. The elder Van Buren continued to play through injuries, taking several shots of Novocaine before each game. He had a career-low 327 rushing yards for the season, as the Eagles finished with a losing record for the first time since 1942.|$|E
5|$|In the off-season, the Astros traded {{starting}} pitcher Claude Osteen to the Cardinals, and lost pitching ace Don Wilson, who died from {{carbon monoxide poisoning}} {{at the age of}} 29 on January 5, 1975. As a result, Richard entered the 1975 season as the third starter of the Astros' pitching rotation, behind veterans Larry Dierker and Dave Roberts. Richard was scheduled to start on April 9 versus the Braves. He was removed from the game in the fifth inning after jamming <b>his</b> <b>toe</b> on the first base bag but gave up no earned runs in his start. Richard continued to exhibit wildness, as shown when he issued eight walks in both his third and fourth starts of the season. He followed by pitching a complete game win against the San Diego Padres on April 29. The following start, he walked a career-high eleven batters in just six innings of pitching and also gave up seven runs in the Astros' 12–8 win over the Giants. By the All-Star break, Richard had six wins and four losses with a 4.93ERA in just over 98innings of work.|$|E
25|$|Van Persie's {{good form}} {{at the start}} of the 2005–06 season earned him the Player of the Month award for November 2005 after eight goals in eight starts, and he was rewarded with a five-year {{contract}} extension until 2011 on 4 January. Two days after signing the contract, however, van Persie was again hit by injury when an opponent stepped on his foot and broke <b>his</b> <b>toe</b> during an FA Cup match against Cardiff.|$|E

25|$|In 1890 Cork and Wexford did {{battle in}} the All-Ireland final. The game was a {{controversial}} one and was marred by ill-tempered behaviour. A Cork player had <b>his</b> <b>toe</b> broken {{by one of his}} Wexford counterparts. Cork captain Dan Lane walked his men off the field in protest. At the time Cork were trailing by 2-2 to 1-6; however, the GAA's Central Council later backed Cork and the team were awarded the All-Ireland title.|$|E
25|$|On 16 March 2012 Dailly {{signed for}} League Two side Southend United on non-contract terms, {{following}} several months training {{with the club}} to recuperate from a knee injury. Dailly made his debut for Southend on 17 March 2012, playing 90 minutes in the 3–2 win at Hereford United. In Dailly's third appearance for the club, against Bristol Rovers on 24 March 2012, he broke <b>his</b> <b>toe</b> ruling him out {{for the remainder of}} the season.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1995–96, Australia played home series against Pakistan and Sri Lanka. He took 11 wickets in the first Test against Pakistan but broke <b>his</b> <b>toe</b> in the second. Selectors {{included}} him in the squad for the third Test just days later {{to give him the}} chance to prove his fitness; he did so by taking four wickets in Pakistan's first innings and another four in their second to be named the player of the series.|$|E

25|$|O'Neal missed {{training}} camp due to surgery on an arthritic toe. He opted against a more involved surgery to return back quicker. Still, <b>his</b> <b>toe</b> bothered him throughout the season. Jackson also missed most of camp {{due to the}} death of his 94-year-old mother, and Bryant returned to Philadelphia to bury his grandfather. Combined with the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, O'Neal said {{it would be hard for}} basketball players to be divided by pettiness.|$|E
25|$|Burbeck {{hoped that}} his son Henry would follow in his {{military}} footsteps, but Henry died {{when he tried to}} test his strength by lifting a keg of silver dollars which fell on his foot and severed <b>his</b> <b>toe</b> while at sea on a revenue cutter. By the time the cutter reached New York and a physician was summoned, it was too late and he died. Thereafter, Gen. Burbeck was so overcome by grief that he would not have his son's name spoken in his house.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} opened, as now, by a kick-off. The player of 1880 might, if he chose, drive the ball {{far down the}} field. Or, {{technically}} kicking the ball by merely touching it with <b>his</b> <b>toe,</b> he might {{pick it up and}} run with it. Players when tackled invariably endeavored to pass the ball back to another member of their side for a further advance, a method of play so highly developed that it was not infrequent to see a ball passed as many as five times during a single play.|$|E

25|$|Byars broke <b>his</b> <b>toe</b> {{just prior}} to the start of the 1985 season, ending his Heisman hopes and seriously handicapping the Buckeye attack. He {{returned}} against Purdue with Ohio State at 4–1 and scored twice, but then re-injured his foot the next week against Minnesota. Iowa was top-ranked nationally when they came into Ohio Stadium favored to end the longest home winning streak in the country, and were the first #1 team the Buckeyes faced since Purdue in 1968. Ohio State's defense dominated with four interceptions to win 22–13.|$|E
25|$|If the bowler bowls {{without some}} part of the front foot landing either {{grounded}} or in the air behind the popping crease. If the front foot of a bowler lands behind the crease and slides beyond, then it is not a No ball. If the foot lands outside the crease, it is a No ball. It is legal for a spin bowler, for example, to land with <b>his</b> <b>toe</b> spikes grounded wholly in front of the crease but to have his heel in the air behind that line. The bowler must satisfy the umpire that {{some part of}} the foot lands initially behind -or on- the line, and in big games this question is now subject to minute examination by television replay. Recent practice has been to allow the bowler the benefit of any residual doubt in this judgement.|$|E
25|$|Yonakor {{grew up in}} the Dorchester {{neighborhood}} of Boston, Massachusetts, the youngest son of immigrants from lithuania. At the age of 10, he came down with a leg infection after cutting himself while ice skating. He was too embarrassed to tell his mother about the injury and hoped it would go away, but it worsened {{to the point where he}} could no longer walk. Doctors drained fluid from his body by puncturing <b>his</b> <b>toe,</b> and Yonakor spent a year as an invalid; doctors told him he may never walk again. Starting out by crawling, however, Yonakor gradually regained his strength and his health. He went on to play three seasons of football at Mechanic Arts High School, and spent one year at Marianapolis Preparatory School in Thompson, Connecticut at the prompting of Frank Leahy, then the head football coach at Boston College. Yonakor was set to go to Boston College, but chose the University of Notre Dame instead when Leahy became head football coach there in 1941.|$|E

25|$|The east-facing {{pediment}} on {{the southern}} library shows Śiva seated on the summit of Mount Kailāsa, his mythological abode. His consort Umā sits on his lap and clings anxiously to his torso. Other beings are also present {{on the slopes of}} the mountain, arranged in a strict hierarchy of three tiers from top to bottom. In the top tier sit bearded wise men and ascetics, in the middle tier mythological figures with the heads of animals and the bodies of humans, and in the bottom tier large animals, including a number of lions. In the middle of the scene stands the ten-headed demon king Rāvaṇa. He is shaking the mountain in its very foundations as the animals flee from his presence and as the wise men and mythological beings discuss the situation or pray. According to the legend, Śiva stopped Rāvaṇa from shaking the mountain by using <b>his</b> <b>toe</b> to press down on the mountain and to trap Rāvana underneath for 1000 years.|$|E
25|$|In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Voldemort is {{initially}} only heard, possessing the scratchy, weak voice {{heard in the}} first film. By the film's climax, however, he appears in his physical form for the first time, played by Ralph Fiennes. As in the book, Voldemort is shown clad in dark black robes, being tall and emaciated, with no hair and yellowish teeth; his wand has a white tone and the handle appears {{to be made of}} bone; his finger nails are long and pale blue while <b>his</b> <b>toe</b> nails appear to be infected. Unlike in the book, his pupils are not cat-like and his eyes are blue, because producer David Heyman felt that his evil {{would not be able to}} be seen and would not fill the audience with fear (his eyes do briefly take on a snake-like appearance when he opens them after turning human, but quickly turn normal). As in the book, the film version of Voldemort has snake-like slit nostrils with the flesh of his nose significantly pressed back. Ralph Fiennes' nose was not covered in makeup on the set, but was digitally removed in post-production. In this first appearance, Voldemort also has a forked tongue, but this element was removed for the subsequent films.|$|E
