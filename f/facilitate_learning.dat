The study of learning processes, from both cognitive and behavioral perspectives, allows researchers to understand individual differences in intelligence, cognitive development, affect, motivation, self-regulation, and self-concept, as well as their role in learning. The field of educational psychology relies heavily on quantitative methods, including testing and measurement, to enhance educational activities related to instructional design, classroom management, and assessment, which serve to <b>facilitate</b> <b>learning</b> processes in various educational settings across the lifespan.|$|E

Mechanisms such as reflection on actual or mental actions vis-à-vis alternative solutions to problems, tagging new concepts or solutions to symbols that help one recall and mentally manipulate them are just a few examples of how mechanisms of cognitive development may be used to <b>facilitate</b> <b>learning.</b>|$|E

The study also examined the relationship between the headmasters’ and headmistresses’ perceptions of transformational leadership and their roles in <b>facilitating</b> <b>learning</b> organization. A survey method was used to collect data from 41 headmasters and headmistresses who were pursuing Bachelor degree programme in Educational Management. Organizational learning questionnaire developed by Silins, Zarins and Mulford (2002) was used to measure the roles of headmasters and headmistresses in <b>facilitating</b> <b>learning</b> organization, while transformational leadership questionnaire developed by Leithwood and Jantzi (1996, 1997) was used to assess leadership. Means and Pearson product correlations were used to analyze the data. Major results of this study showed that headmasters and headmistresses have high perceptions of learning organization and transformation leadership. Overall, transformational leadership indicated high and significant correlation with overall learning organization. Each dimension of transformational leadership indicated high and significant correlation with overall learning organization. Further, almost all dimensions of leadership showed significant correlations with dimensions of learning organization. ...|$|R

2500|$|In animals, the {{appearance}} of ponto-geniculo-occipital waves (PGO waves) is related {{to that of the}} bioelectric outputs of rapid eye movements. These waves are most clearly seen during the transition from non-REM to REM sleep. Although these phasic waves are observed in many portions of the animal brain, they are most noticeable in the pons, lateral geniculate bodies, and the occipital cortex. Peigneux et al., 2006, reported that the lateral geniculate nucleus and occipital cortex display higher levels of activity during REM sleep than during wakefulness. This would add to the theory that activation in these areas is similar to PGO wave activation in animals. Pontine waves are commonly seen in animals as a mechanism to help <b>facilitate</b> <b>learning</b> and memory consolidation. [...] An improvement on task performance was seen to be a result of increased P waves between REM sleep sessions. In a study using post learning REM sleep deprivation the effects of stimulating the P wave generator (located in the pontine tegmentum) of a rat were observed. Two groups of rats underwent an avoidance learning task and then allowed a sleep period while another group of rats were deprived sleep. When comparing the two groups the sleep deprived rats showed a significant deficit in learning from having not undergone REM sleep. In another rat group, the P wave generator was stimulated using a carbachol injection and the rats then underwent a sleep deprivation stage. When these rats were again tested on their learning it was shown that activation of the P wave generator during sleep deprivation resulted in normal learning being achieved. This would point {{to the fact that the}} activation of P waves, even without REM sleep, was enough to enhance the memory processes that would not normally have happened.|$|E
