5|$|The {{number of}} {{globular}} clusters discovered continued to increase, reaching 83 in 1915, 93 in 1930 and 97 by 1947. A total of 152 globular clusters {{have now been}} discovered in the Milky Way galaxy, out of an estimated total of 180 ± 20. These additional, undiscovered globular clusters {{are believed to be}} <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> gas and dust of the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} the moon in the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit {{to make it look}} like the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> painted moon, as a source for lighting.|$|E

5|$|According to Bayliss, the dog {{had been}} given a {{morphine}} injection earlier in the day, then was anaesthetized during the procedure with six fluid ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether (ACE), delivered from an ante-room to a tube in his trachea, via a pipe <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> bench on which the men were working. The Swedish students disputed that {{the dog had}} been adequately anaesthetized. They said the dog had appeared conscious during the procedure, had tried to lift himself off the board, {{and that there was no}} smell of anaesthesia or the usual hissing sound of the apparatus. Other students said the dog had not struggled, but had merely twitched.|$|E
5|$|In general, humans {{consider}} woodpeckers in a favourable light; {{they are}} viewed as interesting birds and fascinating to watch as they drum or forage. However, their activities are not universally appreciated. Some individual birds habitually excavate holes in buildings, fencing and utility poles, and there are various reverberatory structures on buildings such as gutters, downspouts, chimneys, vents and aluminium sheeting, that the birds find attractive for drumming. Houses with shingles or wooden boarding are also attractive as possible nesting or roosting sites, especially when close to large trees or woodland. Several exploratory holes may be made, especially at the junctions of vertical boards or {{at the corners of}} tongue-and-groove boarding. The birds may also drill holes in houses as they forage for insect larvae and pupae <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> woodwork.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 29 June, Skanderbeg {{arranged}} his army for battle. Apart from the 3,000 warriors <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman army, Skanderbeg left another reserve force of 3,000 {{under the command of}} Vrana Konti. The Albanian army was positioned in a crescent shape curving inwards. They were divided into three groups, each composed of 3,000 men. They were all placed {{at the bottom of a}} hill, with the intention of luring the Ottoman cavalry-based army into a downhill charge. The Albanian left wing was commanded by Tanush Thopia with 1,500 horsemen and an equal number of infantrymen. On the right wing, Skanderbeg placed Moisi Golemi in the same manner as Thopia. In front of the wings, foot archers were placed to lure the Ottomans in. In the center, there were 3,000 men under the command of Skanderbeg and Ajdin Muzaka. One-thousand horsemen were placed in front of the main division with orders to blunt the initial Turkish cavalry charge. An equal number of archers, trained to accompany the horses, was placed next to these horsemen. The main body of infantry, commanded by Ajdin Muzaka, was placed behind the archers.|$|E

25|$|The battle began before dawn. The {{first part}} of the battle {{consisted}} of Polish hussars repeatedly charging the fortified Russian positions, attempting to break them. The Polish forces continued to make ferocious attacks, and Samuel Maskiewicz, a witness from one hussar company, claimed that his unit charged eight or ten times. The Polish hussars' attack on the infantry, <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> fences, and using firearms, were not successful.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Drue Tartière, Dolores and Tudor Wilkinson were both heavily {{involved}} in the resistance. Tartière had also been in Vittel, and had managed to obtain a release on the false grounds that she was dying of cancer. She went on to help smuggle at least 42 Allied airmen out of occupied territory. She wrote that a short wave radio had been concealed at 18 Quai d'Orléans so that the Resistance could communicate with London, and machine guns were <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> fireplace {{and elsewhere in the}} apartment. Tudor Wilkinson's secretary, who had been a professor at the Sorbonne, was active in organising sabotage by railway workers.|$|E
25|$|While Coligny was {{engaging}} the enemy infantry, Bouillon, who kept his cavalry <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> heights, was awaiting for {{a signal from}} his squire Domerville, whom he had left in a hill nearby, to {{the right moment to}} charge against the French Royal forces. Half an hour {{from the beginning of the}} battle, Domerville made the signal, and then Bouillon charged upon Coligny's right flank. The French cavalry was thrown in disarray over the French infantry, which was broken and driven from the field in disorder. The malcontents and the Habsburg forces took 4,000 prisoners, including 400 officers, all the artillery and the baggage of Coligny's Royal army, many flags and a cash of 400,000 livres.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 August 917, the battle between the Bulgarians and the Byzantines began by the river Achelous near the modern village Acheloi, 8 {{kilometers}} {{to the north of}} Anchialus (modern Pomorie) on Bulgaria's Black Sea coast. The Byzantine generals planned to outflank the right Bulgarian wing in order to detach Simeon's troops from the Balkan Passes. The Bulgarian ruler concentrated his most powerful forces in the two wings and left the centre relatively weak in order to surround the enemy when the centre would yield to the Byzantine attack. Simeon himself was in charge of large cavalry reserves <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> hills which were intended to strike the decisive blow.|$|E
25|$|Set on Wisteria Lane, {{a street}} in the fictional town of Fairview in the fictional Eagle State, Desperate Housewives follows {{the lives of a}} group of women as seen through the eyes of their late friend and {{neighbor}} who committed suicide in the pilot episode. The storyline covers 13 years of the women's lives over eight seasons, set between the years 2004–2008, and later 2013–2017 (the story arc includes a five-year passage of time, as well as flashbacks ranging from the 1980s to the 2020s). They work through domestic struggles and family life, while facing the secrets, crimes, and mysteries <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> doors of their—on the surface—beautiful and seemingly perfect suburban neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|Unique to {{this version}} was a bonus awarded {{at the end}} of the program, after Final Jeopardy! was completed. The episode's {{champion}} selected a prize <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> thirty squares on the Jeopardy! board. Among the prizes was a $25,000 cash award which was hidden behind two squares. In order to win the top prize, the champion had to find both $25,000 cards in succession (winning the prize on the second pick if it was not the latter half of the grand prize). In later episodes, the bonus board was dropped and the evening's champion received a prize based upon his or her final score, with a Chevrolet Vega or Chevrolet Caprice (or even additional cash prizes of $10,000 or $25,000) as possibilities.|$|E

25|$|The forelimbs {{are covered}} with large {{transverse}} scales. Both the forelimbs and the hind limbs are webbed, reflecting their largely aquatic habits. The necks of black marsh turtles are characteristically thick, forming a collar around the head when it is retracted into the shell. All of the limbs, the tail, and the neck are dark gray to black. The head is broad with a short upwardly pointed snout. It is mostly black on top with cream to yellow markings around the eyes and at the throat. It also has a pair of pale white to yellow spots just behind the tympanum, usually <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> folds of the neck. The powerful jaws are pale yellow to pale brown in color and curves upwards, earning it the charming name of 'smiling terrapin'.|$|E
25|$|The plumage of {{the family}} is cryptic, as is usual with ground birds, with typical colors ranging through dark brown, rufous, buff, yellow and grey. Plumage does not usually differ between sexes, but in a few species females are brighter. The forest dwellers tend to be darker and more uniform, whereas the steppe species are paler with more barring, speckling, or streaking. Tinamous have {{well-developed}} powder down feathers; these grow continuously and disintegrate at the tips into a powder that is spread {{through the rest of}} the feathers by preening. This gives the plumage a glossy appearance as well as waterproofing it. Their tails are short, sometimes <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> coverts, and possibly indicative of an ability to sacrifice feathers to a predator in order to escape when grasped. Some tinamous have crests. Members of Eudromia have the most developed crests and, when excited, will direct them forward.|$|E
25|$|Wanyan Heda {{learned of}} this plan and led 200,000 men to {{intercept}} Tolui. At Dengzhou, he set an ambush in a valley with several {{tens of thousands of}} cavalry <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> crest of either mountain, but Tolui's spies alerted him and he kept his main force with the supply train, sending only a smaller force of light cavalry to skirt around the valley and attack the Jin troops from behind. Wanyan Heda saw that his plan had been foiled and prepared his troops for a Mongol assault. At Mount Yu, southwest of Dengzhou, the two armies met in a pitched battle. The Jin army had an advantage in numbers, and fought fiercely. The Mongols then withdrew from Mount Yu by about 30 li, and Tolui changed his strategy. Leaving a part of his force to keep Wanyan Heda occupied, he sent most of his men to strike northwards at Kaifeng in several dispersed contingents to avoid alerting Heda.|$|E
