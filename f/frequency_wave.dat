Short-wavelength high-pitched sound waves are reflected and refracted by many separated water droplets, partially cancelling and dissipating their energy (a process called [...] "damping"). In contrast, low pitched notes, with a low frequency and a long wavelength, move the air less rapidly and less often, and lose less energy to interactions with small water droplets. Low-pitched notes are less affected by fog and travel further, which is why foghorns use a low-pitched tone.|$|E

50|$|Regarding {{petroleum}} and {{geothermal exploration}} (within a small scale), effect of fluid distribution on P- wave propagation in partially saturated rocks {{is the main}} responsible for the reservoir-related wavefield absorption. The high level of attenuation, within the infrasonic bandwidth (below 10 Hz) of the seismic field observed in natural oil-saturated porous media during the last years (successfully explained by mesoscopic homogeneous models) is the main responsible of the passive seismic wave field shifting within a low frequency range. Pressure differences between regions with different fluid/solid properties induce frequency-dependency of the attenuation (Qp and Qs reservoir factors) and velocity dispersion (Vp, Vs) of the low <b>frequency</b> <b>wave</b> field.|$|E
50|$|Although {{this concept}} {{is based on}} an antenna {{receiving}} a radio <b>frequency</b> <b>wave,</b> knowing Aeff directly supplies the (power) gain of that antenna. Due to reciprocity, an antenna's gain in receiving and transmitting are identical. Therefore, Aeff can just as well be used to compute the performance of a transmitting antenna. Note that Aeff {{is a function of the}} direction of the radio wave relative to the orientation of the antenna, since the gain of an antenna varies according to its radiation pattern. When no direction is specified, Aeff is understood to refer to its maximum value, with the antenna oriented so its main lobe, the axis of maximum sensitivity, is directed toward the source.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} new {{universal}} high order subroutine for shock boundary layer interaction. First, an effective shock/discontinuity detector has been developed. The detector has two steps. The first step is to check the ratio of the truncation errors on the coarse and fine grids and the second step is to check the local ratio of the left and right slopes. The currently popular shock/discontinuity detectors can detect shock, but mistake high <b>frequency</b> <b>waves</b> and critical points as shock and then damp the physically important high <b>frequency</b> <b>waves.</b> Preliminary results show the new shock/discontinuity detector is very delicate and can detect all shocks including strong, weak and oblique shocks or discontinuity in function and the first, second, and third order derivatives without artificial constants, but never mistake high <b>frequency</b> <b>waves</b> and critical points, expansion waves as shock. This will overcome the bottle neck problem with numerical simulation for the shock-boundary layer interaction, shock-acoustic interaction, image process, porous media flow, multiple phase flow and anywhere the high <b>frequency</b> <b>waves</b> are important, but discontinuity exists and is mixed with high <b>frequency</b> <b>waves.</b> After detecting the shock we can then use one side high order scheme for shocks and high order central compact scheme for the rest if the shock is appropriately located. Then a high order universal subroutine for finite difference method is developed which can be used for any finite difference code for accurate numerical derivatives.

50|$|A more poignant example exists through {{examining}} auditory perception. Generally speaking {{the greater the}} distance between the ears, the greater the possible auditory acuity. Also relevant is the amount of density in between the ears, for the strength of the <b>frequency</b> <b>wave</b> alters as it passes through a given medium. The brain's auditory system takes these factors into account as it process information, but again without any need for a symbolic manipulation system. This is because {{the distance between the}} ears for example does not need symbols to represent it. The distance itself creates the necessary opportunity for greater auditory acuity. The amount of density between the ears is similar, in that it is the actual amount itself that simply forms the opportunity for frequency alteration. Thus under consideration of the physical properties of the body, a symbolic system is unnecessary and an unhelpful metaphor.|$|E

This approach relies {{on the fact that}} trigonometric polynomials are an orthonormal basis for [...] The spectral element method chooses instead a high degree piecewise polynomial basis functions, also achieving a very high order of accuracy. Such polynomials are usually orthogonal Chebyshev polynomials or very high order Legendre polynomials over non-uniformly spaced nodes. In SEM computational error decreases exponentially as the order of approximating polynomial, therefore a fast convergence of solution to the exact solution is realized with fewer degrees of freedom of the structure in comparison with FEM.In structural health monitoring, FEM can be used for detecting large flaws in a structure, but as the size of the flaw is reduced {{there is a need to}} use a high <b>frequency</b> <b>wave</b> with a small wavelength. Therefore, the FEM mesh must be much finer, resulting in increased computational time and an inexact solution. SEM, with fewer degrees of freedom per node, can be useful for detecting small flaws.
