25|$|In general, if an {{excitatory}} synapse is strong enough, an action {{potential in the}} presynaptic neuron will trigger an action potential in the postsynaptic cell. In many cases the <b>excitatory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potential</b> (EPSP) will not reach the threshold for eliciting an action potential. When action potentials from multiple presynaptic neurons fire simultaneously, or if a single presynaptic neuron fires at a high enough frequency, the EPSPs can overlap and summate. If enough EPSPs overlap, the summated EPSP can reach the threshold for initiating an action potential. This process is known as summation, and {{can serve as a}} high pass filter for neurons.|$|E
25|$|Henneman {{proposed}} that the mechanism underlying the Size Principle was that the smaller motor neurons had a smaller surface area and therefore a higher membrane resistance. He predicted that the current generated by an <b>excitatory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potential</b> (EPSPs) {{would result in a}} higher voltage change (depolarization) across the neuronal membrane of the smaller motor neurons and therefore larger EPSPs in smaller motoneurons. Burke later demonstrated that there was a graded decrease of both EPSP and inhibitory post synaptic potential (IPSP) amplitudes from small to large motoneurons. This seemed to confirm Henneman's idea, but Burke disagreed, pointing out that larger neurons with a larger surface area had space for more synapses. Burke eventually showed (in a very small sample of neurons) that smaller motoneurons have a greater number of synaptic inputs from a single input source. The topic is probably still regarded as controversial.|$|E
2500|$|Non{{synaptic}} and {{synaptic plasticity}} {{have been shown}} to work concurrently {{in a variety of ways}} to produce stimulating effects in the neuron. [...] This includes spike generation, a product of nonsynaptic regulation of [...] potassium and other presynaptic ion channels, which increase the response of the <b>excitatory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potential</b> through neurotransmitter release and augmentation of the action potential. Nonsynaptic dendritic plasticity also adds to the effects of synaptic plasticity through widening of the action potential. [...] As will be discussed further, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BNDF) is produced by neurons to coordinate nonsynaptic and synaptic plasticity. [...] Nonsynaptic changes in the somal body, axon, or dendrites of the neuron are inextricably linked to synaptic strength.|$|E
50|$|Trk receptors {{and their}} ligands (neurotrophins) also affect neurons' {{functional}} properties. Both NT-3 and BDNF {{are important in}} the regulation and development of synapses formed between afferent neurons and motor neurons. Increased NT-3/trkC binding results in larger monosynaptic <b>excitatory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> (EPSPs) and reduced polysynaptic components. On the other hand, increased NT-3 binding to trkB to BDNF has the opposite effect, reducing the size of monosynaptic <b>excitatory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> (EPSPs) and increasing polysynaptic signaling.|$|R
50|$|Spatial summation: If a cell is {{receiving}} input at two synapses that are near each other, their <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> add together. If the cell {{is receiving}} two <b>excitatory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potentials,</b> they combine {{so that the}} membrane potential is depolarized by {{the sum of the}} two changes. If there are two inhibitory potentials, they also sum, and the membrane is hyperpolarized by that amount. If the cell is receiving both inhibitory and <b>excitatory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potentials,</b> they can cancel out, or one can be stronger than the other, and the membrane potential will change by the difference between them.|$|R

2500|$|Nonsynaptic {{neuronal}} {{areas such}} as the axon also have inherent qualities that affect the synapse. [...] These essential mechanisms include the delay in depolarization that action potential undergoes while traveling down the axon. [...] This intrinsic quality slows the propagation of action potentials and is due to the movement of depolarizing current down the cytoplasm and the intermittent placement of sodium channels on the Nodes of Ranvier. [...] These mechanisms always exist, but may change depending on the conditions of the cell soma, axon, and dendrites at the time. Therefore, latency, or delay in propagation of action potentials or EPSPs, can be variable. [...] Every <b>excitatory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potential</b> that is propagated to a postsynaptic cell is first transmitted through the action potential down the axon in the presynaptic cell, and thus nonsynaptic plasticity inherently affects synaptic plasticity.|$|E

50|$|The {{activation}} of receptors by nicotine modifies {{the state of}} neurons through two main mechanisms.

On the other hand, the entry of calcium acts, either directly or indirectly, on different intracellular cascades. This leads, for example, to the regulation of the activity of some genes or the release of neurotransmitters.|$|E
5000|$|These neurotransmitters are [...] "captured" [...] by cell surface receptors, which {{generate}} an <b>excitatory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potential,</b> {{in order to}} transmit the impulse again to another cell. In order to maintain permanent changes over time, {{it is necessary to}} store that information. This is done, primarily, through the basic structure messengers (messenger RNA).

These random potentials have similar time courses as <b>excitatory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> (EPSPs) and inhibitory <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> (IPSPs), yet they lead to variable neuronal responses. The variability is due to differences in the discharge times of action potentials.|$|R

This version is reproduced with permission from Australian Society of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery. Journal also known as: Australian Journal of Oto-laryngologyThere is considerable evidence that the brain translates (encodes) the frequency of a sound into both place of excitation (place encoding), and the pattern of intervals between action potentials (temporal encoding).

50|$|Postsynaptic depolarizations {{can either}} {{transmit}} excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters. Those that release excitatory vesicles {{are referred to}} as <b>excitatory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potential</b> (EPSP). Alternatively, inhibitory vesicles stimulate postsynaptic receptors such as to allow Cl− ions to enter the cell or K+ ions to leave the cell, which results in an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). If the EPSP is dominant, the threshold of excitation in the postynaptic neuron may be reached, resulting in the generation of an action potential in the neuron(s) in turn postsynaptic to it, propagating the signal.|$|E
50|$|The {{direction}} selective (DS) ganglion cells receive inputs from bipolar {{cells and}} starburst amacrine cells. The DS ganglion cells {{respond to their}} preferred direction with a large <b>excitatory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potential</b> followed by a small inhibitory response. On the other hand, they respond to their null direction with a simultaneous small <b>excitatory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potential</b> and a large inhibitory postsynaptic potential. Starburst amacrine cells have been viewed as a strong candidate for direction selectivity in ganglion cells because they can release both GABA and Ach. Their dendrites branch out radiantly from a soma, {{and there is a}} significant dendritic overlap. Optical measurements of Ca2+ concentration showed that they respond strongly to the centrifugal motion (the outward motion from the soma to the dendrites), while they don't respond well to the centripetal motion (the inward motion from the dendritic tips to the soma).When the starburst cells were ablated with toxins, direction selectivity was eliminated. Moreover, their release of neurotransmitters itself, specifically calcium ions, reflect direction selectivity, which may be presumably attributed to the synaptic pattern. The branching pattern is organized such that certain presynaptic input will have more influence on a given dendrite than others, creating a polarity in excitation and inhibition. Further evidence suggests that starburst cells release inhibitory neurotransmitters, GABA onto each other in a delayed and prolonged manner. This accounts for the temporal property of inhibition.|$|E
