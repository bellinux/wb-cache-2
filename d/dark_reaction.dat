A low temperature combined with a high intensity of sunlight means that NADH and ATP heap up but cannot be converted into glucose because the <b>dark</b> <b>reaction</b> cannot process them swiftly enough.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>dark</b> <b>reaction</b> or Calvin cycle ties {{atmospheric}} {{carbon dioxide}} and uses NADH and ATP to convert it into sucrose. The available NADH and ATP, as well as temperature and carbon dioxide levels determine the rate of this reaction. Together those two reactions are termed photosynthesis. The rate of photosynthesis {{is determined by the}} interaction of a number of factors including temperature, light intensity and carbon dioxide.|$|E

50|$|C4 {{plants like}} {{maize and sorghum}} can achieve a higher yield at high solar {{radiation}} intensities, because they prevent the leaking of captured carbon dioxide due of the spatial separation of carbon dioxide capture and carbon dioxide use in the <b>dark</b> <b>reaction.</b> This means that their photorespiration is almost zero. This advantage is sometimes offset by {{a higher rate of}} maintenance respiration. In most models for natural crops, carbon dioxide levels are assumed to be constant.|$|E
5000|$|In the Calvin cycle, {{the energy}} from the {{electron}} carriers is used in carbon fixation, the conversion {{of carbon dioxide and}} water into carbohydrates. RPIA is essential in the cycle, as Ru5P generated from R5P is subsequently converted to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), the acceptor of carbon dioxide in the first <b>dark</b> <b>reaction</b> of photosynthesis (Figure 3). [...] The direct product of RuBP carboxylase reaction is glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; these are subsequently used to make larger carbohydrates. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is converted to glucose which is later converted by the plant to storage forms (e.g., starch or cellulose) or used for energy.|$|E
50|$|The {{efficiency}} of both {{light and dark}} reactions can be measured but {{the relationship between the}} two can be complex. For example, the ATP and NADPH energy molecules, created by the light reaction, can be used for carbon fixation or for photorespiration in C3 plants. Electrons may also flow to other electron sinks. For this reason, it is not uncommon for authors to differentiate between work done under non-photorespiratory conditions and under photorespiratory conditions. Chlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II can measure the light reaction, and Infrared gas analyzers can measure the <b>dark</b> <b>reaction.</b> It is also possible to investigate both at the same time using an integrated chlorophyll fluorometer and gas exchange system, or by using two separate systems together. Infrared gas analyzers and some moisture sensors are sensitive enough to measure the photosynthetic assimilation of CO2, and of ΔH2O using reliable methods CO2 is commonly measured in μmols/m2/s−1, parts per million or volume per million and H20 is commonly measured in mmol/m2/s−1 or in mbars. By measuring CO2 assimilation, ΔH2O, leaf temperature, barometric pressure, leaf area, and photosynthetically active radiation or PAR, it becomes possible to estimate, “A” or carbon assimilation, “E” or transpiration, “gs” or stomatal conductance, and Ci or intracellular CO2. However, it is more common to used chlorophyll fluorescence for plant stress measurement, where appropriate, because the most commonly used measuring parameters FV/FM and Y(II) or F/FM’ can be made in a few seconds, allowing the measurement of larger plant populations.|$|E

50|$|An {{integrated}} fluorometer is {{a system}} that measures the light reaction and the <b>dark</b> <b>reaction</b> of photosynthesis. Software allows combined operation of gas exchange measurement and chlorophyll fluorescence measurement of a leaf. These parameters are used to non-destructively measure the photosynthetic efficiency of plants. The use of an integrated chlorophyll fluorometer provides the opportunity to measure additional measuring parameters that allow for a more exact measurement of photosynthesis than with gas exchange alone. Advanced gas exchange instrumentation, by itself, is capable of measuring A/Ci curves, commonly used for plant characterization. “A” is the term for photosynthetic rate (rate of CO2 exchange in the leaf chamber), and Ci is Sub-stomatal CO2 concentration or intracellular CO2 level within the leaf. When measured over a range of CO2 levels above and below ambient conditions, A/Ci curves become possible. With the addition of an integrated chlorophyll fluorometer, it becomes possible to measure more accurate A/CC curves, or photosynthetic rate at the site of carboxylation in chloroplasts. The integrated fluorometer allows measurement of mesophyll conductance, or the opposite of the resistance to CO2 transfer from intracellular air spaces to the site of carboxylation in chloroplasts. Various integrated chlorophyll fluorometer measuring protocols, such as the Laisk Protocol, the Kok protocol and the Yin Protocol are used to measure or estimate gm or mesophyll conductance. For example: the Laisk protocol allows the measurement of Γ* or compensation point, and Rd or respiration in the dark. Both values are required to calculate gm or mesophyll conductance and CC or CO2 at the site of carboxylation. Parameters typically measured by the gas exchange portion of the system include: “A” or photosynthetic rate, “gs” or stomatal conductance, “Ci” or sub stomatal CO2 concentration, and “E” or transpiration.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dark</b> <b>reaction</b> is a {{condition}} in which the plate acts as if it is exposed to a low level of active light, even though it is being stored in the dark. The Stouffer scale or the sensitivity guide is used to measure this <b>dark</b> <b>reaction</b> which takes place also as a result of high temperature and relative humidity. If there is much <b>dark</b> <b>reaction</b> taking place, more solid steps will show up on a negative working plate. For the purpose of this experiment diazo and photopolymer presensitised, negative working, lithographic plates were chosen. These plates were cut into small sections to eliminate plate variables. They were then subjected to different levels of temperature and relative humidity in a temperature controllable oven. The relative humidity being controlled by using various super- saturated salt solutions. A light integrator was used to expose the plates to the same amount of light energy, with a sensitivity guide. The plates were then developed by hand and the critical or solid step determined visually to measure the <b>dark</b> <b>reaction</b> undergone by the plates due to variations in temperature, relative humidity, and time. With the results obtained curves were drawn to study the relationship between <b>dark</b> <b>reaction</b> and temperature, <b>dark</b> <b>reaction</b> and relative humidity, and <b>dark</b> <b>reaction</b> and time. The curves show an increase in <b>dark</b> <b>reaction</b> with an increase in temperature, relative humidity, and time in the case of diazo plates. The photopolymer plates, on the other hand, seemed to be more stable at higher temperatures, but a high relative humidity destroys the plate coating. A statistical analyses was done on the results and the percentage dependence of <b>dark</b> <b>reaction</b> on temperature, relative humidity, and time were determined. It is concluded that <b>dark</b> <b>reaction</b> does occur in diazo and photopolymer presensitized plates. And that these plates would last longer if stored under the optimum temperature and relative humidity as suggested by analyzing the data. The results obtained disprove the assumption that photopolymer presensitized plates are not influenced by temperature and relative humidity...|$|E

This form was then converted in a <b>dark</b> <b>reaction</b> to chlorophyllide 684, the form generally observed and {{regarded as the}} in vivo product of the photoreaction. The dark conversion at 2 ° was complete in 6 to 10 min in the various plants. The time course of the <b>dark</b> <b>reaction</b> was followed at 690 nm near the maximum of the difference spectrum for the conversion. There was a constant relationship between the initial amount of chlorophyllide 678 and the final amount of chlorophyllide 684. The rates of the <b>dark</b> <b>reaction</b> at 2 ° varied 3 -fold among the plants treated. The reaction was not first order. At 25 ° the reaction followed at 690 nm was complete in 20 to 60 sec. Q 10 's varied from 2. 8 to 3. 7 between 2 ° and 25 °. Phytochrome absorbancy changes were shown to be too low to interfere with these measurements except in pea leaves. In a subsequent stage of greening newly regenerated protochlorophyllide went through the same sequence upon photoconversion. Chlorophyllide 678 probably corresponds to the product formed in vitro from the protochlorophyllide holochrome. The <b>dark</b> <b>reaction</b> appears to represent the first interaction between the photoconverted holochrome and {{other elements of the}} proplastid.

30|$|Photosynthesis are {{performed}} {{mainly in the}} lower grade photosynthetic bacteria, algae, and chloroplasts in higher plants (Dudkina et al., 2015). They harness solar energy and produce organic compounds containing stable chemical energy, which is the energy source of almost all animals. The processes of photosynthesis can be separated into two parts, light reaction and <b>dark</b> <b>reaction.</b> In chloroplasts, light reaction occurs on the membrane of thylakoids. Two types of protein systems, photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII), participate in the capture of photons and generation of high-energy electrons (Dekker and Boekema 2005; Kouril et al., 2012). Those generated electrons can be transferred in two modes of electron flow: linear electron flow (LEF) and cyclic electron flow (CEF). In LEF, both PSI and PSII are involved, while only PSI participates in CEF. Both ATP and NADPH are produced by LEF, but only ATP can be produced by CEF (Johnson, 2011; Rochaix 2014). As a result, the balance between PSI and PSII can influence the final ratio of ATP/NADPH, which is important for <b>dark</b> <b>reaction.</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>reaction</b> occurs in chloroplast stroma, where CO 2 is fixed and carbohydrates are produced (Livingston et al., 2010).|$|E
40|$|Bacteriophage {{particles}} are called active {{if they are}} capable of generating a plaque when plated on agar by a standard technique. Exposure of the particles to ultraviolet radiation of wave length 253. 7 m[mu] inactivates them in this sense. Following adsorption of the inactive particles to sensitive host bacteria, exposure of the suspension to light of the violet and near ultraviolet region causes a fraction of the particles to regain their activity, a phenomenon called photoreactivation. The kinetics of photoreactivation of bacteriophage T 2 have been investigated for the purpose of studying the mechanism by which photoreactivation takes place. The presence of a <b>dark</b> <b>reaction</b> in addition to the light reaction has been demonstrated. The <b>dark</b> <b>reaction</b> precedes the other and has the function of supplying the light-absorbing material which enters into the light reaction.
