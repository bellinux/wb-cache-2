40|$|This Article {{analyzes}} jury {{findings from}} nearly one thousand negligence suits {{to determine whether}} <b>juries</b> <b>in</b> modified comparative negligence jurisdictions apportion percentages of negligence differently than <b>juries</b> <b>in</b> pure comparative negligence jurisdictions. We find that <b>juries</b> <b>in</b> modified comparative negligence jurisdictions are substantially less likely to find that a plaintiff was more than 50 percent negligent. This evidence of jury manipulation strengthens the case for pure comparative negligence, which we argue is already superior on theoretical and policy grounds...|$|R

40|$|Drawing upon {{a recent}} study of felony <b>jury</b> {{sentencing}} <b>in</b> Kentucky, Virginia, and Arkansas, this essay highlights some of the similarities and differences between <b>jury</b> sentencing <b>in</b> capital cases and <b>jury</b> sentencing <b>in</b> non-capital cases. Unlike <b>jury</b> sentencing <b>in</b> capital cases, <b>jury</b> sentencing <b>in</b> non-capital cases includes functional differentials <b>in</b> judge and <b>jury</b> options for sentencing, and fewer controls on arbitrary decision-making. <b>Jury</b> sentencing <b>in</b> both contexts shares the potential for reluctance on the part of elected judges to reduce jury sentences, information gaps on the part of jurors in setting sentences, and, above all, service as a tool in negotiating settlements...|$|R

5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} <b>jury</b> <b>in</b> the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys {{to determine the}} ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue.

5|$|After {{the premiere}} of Trial by <b>Jury</b> <b>in</b> 1875, {{operetta}} companies in London, the British provinces and elsewhere picked it up rapidly, usually playing it as a forepiece or an afterpiece to a French operetta. The first American productions were at the Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia on 22 October 1875 and the Eagle Theatre in New York City on 15 November 1875. The world tour of the original British production took it to America, Australia, and elsewhere. It was even translated into German, and premièred as Im Schwurgericht, at the Carltheater on 14 September 1886, and as Das Brautpaar vor Gericht at Danzer's Orpheum on 5 October 1901.|$|E

5|$|In 1195 Walter {{issued an}} {{ordinance}} by which four knights were appointed in every hundred {{to act as}} guardians of the peace, a precursor {{to the office of}} Justice of the Peace. His use of the knights, who appear {{for the first time in}} political life, is the first sign of the rise of this class who, either as members of parliament or justices of the peace, later became the mainstay of English government. In 1198, Walter requested a carucage, or plough-tax, of five shillings on every plough-land, or carucate, under cultivation. However, difficulties arose over the assessments, so the justiciar ordered them to be made by a sworn <b>jury</b> <b>in</b> every hundred. It is likely that those jurors were elected.|$|E
