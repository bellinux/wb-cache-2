They will also be equipped with an air suspension system, larger windows and doors, and wheelchair spaces, although {{the vast majority of}} Metro stations are not wheelchair-accessible yet. They will also feature more natural lighting, high definition televisions, a new PA system and surveillance cameras. The MPM-10 uses an Alstom Optonix IGBT-VVVF traction system assembled in the United States. Improved ventilation is also featured, however, as with Montreal's previous generation rolling stock, cars are not air conditioned. News reports also suggest that the new rubber-tire train will have to meet very demanding performance requirements: powerful acceleration, high-speed <b>gradeability,</b> high-performance brakes, good ride comfort, low noise, low maintenance costs, low energy costs and high levels of reliability. The new MPM-10 trains will however maintain the same maximum speed as the current MR-63 and MR-73 trains, 72.4 km/h. Improving on the performance levels of the current fleet and developing new rolling stock capable of using sheer speed as a means of increasing line capacity will represent a major challenge to Bombardier and Alstom.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{a methodology}} for determining desirable characteristics and {{requirements of the}} energy storage system for fuel cell hybrid vehicles. The purpose of this work was to provide supporting analysis for the FreedomCAR Technical Teams in defining energy storage requirements for fuel cell vehicles. The power and energy requirements related to specific roles of the energy storage system have been determined for two vehicle class scenarios, a mid-size car and a mid-size SUV. The specific roles of the energy storage system considered included driveline traction power during fuel cell start-up, powerassist capability during the drive cycle, regenerative braking energy recapture capability, <b>gradeability</b> and acceleration performance improvement, electrical accessory loads, and fuel cell startup and shutdown loads. Considering the requirements for each role individually provides the ability to mix and match the characteristics desired based on the specific design scenario. In the short term, specific cost and specific volume of fuel cell systems will likely lead to hybridized fuel cell vehicles to satisfy cost and volume constraints. The process was applied to define the energy storage system characteristics for several scenarios.

40|$|Battery sizing has {{significant}} {{importance for the}} performance of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Although several research has been done over the years for the battery sizing, no research has focused on battery system efficiency which affects fuel economy. This paper has investigated battery system efficiencies of different optimum battery sizes which were optimised using two design optimisation methodologies. The first methodology considered a single driving pattern at a time, whereas, the second methodology considered different driving patterns simultaneously for the optimisation. The study considered a simulation model of a power-split HEV for the optimisation of battery size along with internal combustion engine, motor, and generator. An electric-assist charge sustaining supervisory control strategy was considered as the energy management. The maximum speed, acceleration, and <b>gradeability</b> were considered as design constraints. The optimisation was carried out using a genetic algorithm. Fuel economy was considered as an objective for the optimisation. Five standard driving patterns of different traffic conditions and driving styles were considered for the optimisation. Battery system efficiency of each optimum design was calculated over five standard driving patterns. This study found that battery system efficiency of the design which was optimised over different driving patterns was on average 2 % higher compared to that of the designs which were optimised over a single driving pattern.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the optimization of the layout {{and of the}} control strategy of through-the-road (TTR) parallel hybrid electric vehicles equipped with two compression-ignition engines that feature different values of maximum output power. First, a tool has been developed to define the optimal layout of each TTR vehicle. This {{is based on the}} minimization of the powertrain and fuel cost over a 10 -year time span, taking into account the fuel consumption. Several performance requirements are guaranteed during the optimization, namely maximum vehicle velocity, 0 - 100 km/h acceleration time, <b>gradeability</b> and the all-electric range. A benchmark optimizer that is based on the dynamic programming theory has been developed to identify the optimal working mode and the gear number, which are the control variables of the problem. A mathematical technique, based on the pre-processing of a configuration matrix, has been developed in order to speed up the calculation time. After the layout optimization, the potential of the two identified hybrid vehicles in improving the fuel economy, compared with the conventional vehicle, has been analyzed and discussed over several driving missions, i. e., the New European Driving Cycle, the Artemis Urban Driving Cycle, the Artemis Rural Driving Cycle, the Artemis Motorway Driving Cycle and the Federal Test Procedure. The contributions related to the vehicle electrification and to the control strategy were identified separately. Finally, a real-time optimizer has also been developed, which is based on the instantaneous maximization of an equivalent powertrain efficiency...|$|E

To this end, a consortium among Ford Otosan, İTÜ and TÜBİTAK, led by Ford Otosan, has been established. In view of Ford Otosan, this project {{is considered to be}} a Phase-I project, which is essentially will be a prototyping stage before commercialization of Ford Otosan Hybrid Electric A 75 kW electric motor coupled rear differential is integrated to a FWD diesel engine Ford Transit vehicle. With the addition of 7. 2 kWh 288 V NiMH battery system and hybrid control system, a 4 WD prototype, Ford Transit HYBRID, with a parallel hybrid configuration is constructed. A rule based control strategy is developed and road tested by setting transition rules between the two power sources.

40|$|In Pakistan, {{forest land}} is either owned by {{government}} {{or at least}} managed by provincial forest service if it is private land. Timber is logged by contractors and delivered by small four wheel drive trucks over low standard roads to a transfer yard, where it is unloaded to await transport to an auction market by on-highway trucks. Six months to one year may pass between the time the timber is harvested {{and when it is}} delivered to the auction market, due to a variety of reasons related to the present transportation system. Not only is the transportation cost high, but deterioration of timber due to delays in delivery causes a significant reduction in value as well as a delayed revenue. This study analyzes an alternative transportation strategy; to construct higher standard roads, use on-highway trucks with trailers, and eliminate transfer yards. The specifications of typical on-highway trucks are reviewed {{in order to determine the}} ability of the trucks to operate in adverse terrain and under necessary road standards. The study finds that <b>gradeability</b> and off-tracking of on-highway trucks is adequate. Dr. John Sessions A break-even equation is formulated to determine the volume of tinther needed per entry to justify the higher standard roads. The study concludes that under some conditions found in Pakistan, the construction of permanent forest roads and elimination of transfer yards will yield both greater revenue to the government and increase the supply of higher value tinther to the market. The break-even volume is found to be sensitive to assumptions of the discount rate, road construction cost, and loss in tinther value due to wood deterioration in transit...|$|E
40|$|A Geo Prizm {{electric}} vehicle conversion by U. S. Electricar was {{tested in the}} INEL HEV Laboratory over several standard driving regimes. The vehicle, owned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), was loaned to the INEL for performance testing under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The Prizm conversion is the fourth vehicle in the planned test series. A summary of the test results is presented as Table ES- 1. For the LA- 92 and the Highway Fuel Economy Test cycles, the driving cycle ranges were 71 and 95 km, respectively. The net DC energy consumption during these cycles was measured at 199 and 154 W-h/km, respectively. During the constant-current-discharge test, the vehicle was driven 150 km at an average steady speed of 43 km/h. Energy consumption at various steady-state speeds, averaged over two tests, was approximately 108 W-h/km at 40 km/hr and 175 W-h/km at 96 km/h at 80 T state-of-charge (SOC). Gradeability-at-speed tests indicated that the vehicle can be driven at 80 km/h up a simulated 5 % grade for periods up to 15 minutes beginning at an initial 100 % SOC, and 3 minutes beginning at 80 % battery depth-of-discharge (DOD). Maximum-effort vehicle acceleration times were determined at five different battery DODs and speeds from 24 to 104 km/h. The acceleration is approximately linear up to 48 km/h, with no DOD effect; at higher speeds the curve becomes non-linear, {{and the effect of}} DOD becomes increasingly evident. <b>Gradeability</b> at each of these speeds was also determined, showing a decrease from the initial 26 % at 24 km/h to 4 % at 104 km/h...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} of planetary rover missions is the traversability of rough terrain areas, steep slopes and very soft soil fields. In the past, rovers repeatedly struggled while driving especially in these soft soils, with the Spirit rover even having to be abandoned. With ESA's upcoming ExoMars mission, a rover with an articulated suspension will land on Mars in 2021 that offers additional degrees of freedom through its actuated deployment joints. A full-body kinematic model allows {{to take full advantage}} of such a locomotion system. In this thesis, such a model was derived for EXM-BB 2, a mobility subsystem prototype for the ExoMars rover. The model allows to specify desired body velocities and additional constraints on joint rates to achieve desired motions and includes a slip formulation on wheel level. Additionally, kinematic redundancies can be exploited by the introduction of secondary sub-tasks through null-space projection. Based on this model, two locomotion modes were implemented for increased traversability performance in rough terrain: Balancing, a mode for body pose adjustment that allows to increase the rover's tip-over stability and decrease its body tilt, and Wheel Walking, a mode for increasing <b>gradeability</b> on slopes and traction in soft soils. The effectiveness of the kinematic model and the locomotion modes were shown in a series of tests in the Planetary Exploration Laboratory at DLR. Balancing was able to reduce the rover body pitch and yaw angle by 5 degrees in uneven terrain and decrease side-slip while driving sideways along a slope by more than 50 percent. Wheel Walking managed to outperform Normal Driving (which only actuates the rover wheels) significantly in terms of traction on a slope. Using Wheel Walking, the rover managed to traverse a 30 degree slope with 70 percent of slip while Normal Driving failed at 21 degrees. Additionally, using Wheel Walking, energy consumption for slope traversal could be reduced by 50 percent...|$|E
