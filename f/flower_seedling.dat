40|$|Abstract Background Teak (Tectona grandis L. f.) is {{currently}} the preferred choice of the timber trade for fabrication of woody products due to its extraordinary qualities and is widely grown around the world. Gene expression studies are essential to explore wood formation of vascular plants, and quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is a sensitive technique employed for quantifying gene expression levels. One or more appropriate reference genes are crucial to accurately compare mRNA transcripts through different tissues/organs and experimental conditions. Despite being the focus of some genetic studies, a lack of molecular information has hindered genetic exploration of teak. To date, qRT-PCR reference genes have not been identified and validated for teak. Results Identification and cloning of nine commonly used qRT-PCR reference genes from teak, including ribosomal protein 60 s (rp 60 s), clathrin adaptor complexes medium subunit family (Cac), actin (Act), histone 3 (His 3), sand family (Sand), β-Tubulin (Β-Tub), ubiquitin (Ubq), elongation factor 1 -α (Ef- 1 α), and glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Expression profiles of these genes were evaluated by qRT-PCR in six tissue and organ samples (leaf, <b>flower,</b> <b>seedling,</b> root, stem and branch secondary xylem) of teak. Appropriate gene cloning and sequencing, primer specificity and amplification efficiency was verified for each gene. Their stability as reference genes was validated by NormFinder, BestKeeper, geNorm and Delta Ct programs. Results obtained from all programs showed that TgUbq and TgEf- 1 α are the most stable genes to use as qRT-PCR reference genes and TgAct is the most unstable gene in teak. The relative expression of the teak cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (TgCAD) gene in lignified tissues at different ages was assessed by qRT-PCR, using TgUbq and TgEf- 1 α as internal controls. These analyses exposed a consistent expression pattern with both reference genes. Conclusion This study proposes a first broad collection of teak tissue and organ mRNA expression data for nine selected candidate qRT-PCR reference genes. NormFinder, Bestkeeper, geNorm and Delta Ct analyses suggested that TgUbq and TgEf- 1 α have the highest expression stability and provided similar results when evaluating TgCAD gene expression, while the commonly used Act should be avoided.

40|$|This study {{consisted}} of two sheep grazed dryland pasture experiments. Experiment l compared sheep production from 3 -year-old cocksfoot based pastures grown in combination with white, Caucasian, subterranean or balansa clover with a ryegrass-white clover pasture and a pure lucerne forage. Sheep liveweight gain per head from each pasture treatment and the pure lucerne stand was recorded in the 2006 / 07 and 2007 / 08 seasons. The cocksfoot-subterranean clover pasture provided equal (381 kg LW/ha in 2006) or higher (476 kg LW/ha in 2007) animal production in spring and gave the highest total animal production (646 kg LW/ha) averaged across years of the five grass based pastures. However, total annual liveweight production from lucerne was higher than any grass based pasture mainly due to superior animal production during summer when lucerne provided 42 - 85 % higher animal production {{than any of the}} grass based pastures. In Experiment 2, the effect of stocking rate (8. 3 (low) and 13. 9 (high) ewes + twin lambs/ha) and time of closing in spring on lamb liveweight gain, pasture production and subterranean clover seedling populations was monitored over 2 years for a dryland cocksfoot-subterranean clover and ryegrass-subterranean clover pasture in Canterbury. In both years, twin lambs grew faster (g/head/d) in spring at low (327; 385) than high (253; 285) stocking rate but total liveweight gain/ha (kg/ha/d) was greater at high (7. 26; 7. 91) than low (5. 43; 6. 38) stocking rate. Ewes also gained 0. 5 and 1. 5 kg/head at the low stocking rate in 2006 and 2007 respectively but lost 0. 2 kg/head in 2006 and gained 0. 3 kg/head at high stocking rate in 2007. Mean subterranean clover seedling populations (per m²) measured in autumn after grazing treatments in the first spring were similar at both low (2850) and high (2500) stocking rate but declined with later closing dates in spring (3850, 2950, 2100 and 1700 at 2, 4, 6, 8 weeks after first visible <b>flower).</b> <b>Seedling</b> populations measured in autumn after grazing treatments in the second spring were also unaffected by stocking rate (low 1290, high 1190) but declined with later closing dates in spring (1470, 1320 and 940 at 3, 5 and 8 weeks after first flowering, respectively). The effect of stocking rate and closing dates in spring on pasture and clover production in the following autumn was similar to the effects on seedling numbers in both years. However, clover production in the following spring was unaffected by stocking rate or closing date in the previous year at the relatively high seedling populations generated by the treatments. This was presumably due to runner growth compensating for lower plant populations in pastures that were closed later in spring. Subterranean clover runner growth in spring may not compensate in a similar manner if seedling numbers in autumn fall below 500 /m². Mean annual dry matter production from cocksfoot and ryegrass pastures grown with and without annual clovers pasture production ranged from 6. 4 to 12. 4 t DM/ha/y but stocking rate (8. 3 vs. 13. 9 ewes/ha) during spring did not affect annual pasture production. Pastures overdrilled with annual clovers yielded 23 - 45 % more dry matter production than pastures grown without annual clovers. The study confirms the important role of subterranean clover in improving pasture production and liveweight gains of sheep in dryland cocksfoot and ryegrass pastures. Lowering stocking rate from 13. 9 to 8. 3 ewes/ha was a less effective method of increasing seed production of subterranean clover in dryland pastures although it did lead to increased liveweight gain per head...|$|E

40|$|A major {{function}} of phytochromes in light-grown plants involves {{the perception of}} changes in the relative amounts of red and far-red light (R:FR ratio) and the initiation of the shade-avoidance response. In Arabidopsis thaliana, this response is typified by increased elongation growth of petioles and accelerated flowering and can be fully induced by end-of-day far-red light (EOD FR) treatments.

Contrary to the behaviour of wild-type or monogenic phyA or phyB seedlings, petiole elongation in phyA phyB seedlings is reduced in response to EOD FR treatments.
