Due to the steady success of the Heavy Seas brand, Sisson and his crew decided to rebrand Clipper City beers in 2010; the beers under the Clipper City brand now sell as Heavy Seas Gold Ale, Heavy Seas Powder Monkey Pale Ale and Heavy Seas Cutlass Amber Lager.|$|R

William McEwan Younger, the son of William Younger, was the {{chairman}} and managing director. The company dedicated itself to the free trade, and promoted its brands to an extent not previously witnessed in the British brewing industry. McEwan's Export {{became one of the}} three core brands of the new company, alongside Newcastle Brown Ale and Younger's Tartan Special. Scottish & Newcastle became the dominant force in brewing across Scotland and the North of England. From the 1960s, the company began to style itself MacEwan's in export markets, in order to make pronunciation easier. The company's McEwan's Strong Ale was the <b>highest</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>beer</b> on general sale throughout the world. McEwan's Export was alternatively sold as India Pale Ale or Scotch Ale overseas. William McEwan Younger retired in 1970.|$|R
40|$|Background: Addition {{of sugar}} syrups {{to the basic}} wort is a popular {{technique}} to achieve <b>higher</b> <b>gravity</b> in <b>beer</b> fermentations, but it results in dilution of the free amino nitrogen (FAN) content in the medium. The multicomponent protease enzyme Flavourzyme has beneficial effect on the brewer's yeast fermentation performance during <b>high</b> <b>gravity</b> fermentations as it increases the initial FAN value and results in higher FAN uptake, higher specific growth rate, higher ethanol yield and improved flavour profile. Results: In the present study, transcriptome and metabolome analysis were used to elucidate {{the effect on the}} addition of the multicomponent protease enzyme Flavourzyme and its influence on the metabolism of the brewer's yeast strain Weihenstephan 34 / 70. The study underlines the importance of sufficient nitrogen availability during the course of beer fermentation. The applied metabolome and transcriptome analysis allowed mapping the effect of the wort sugar composition on the nitrogen uptake. Conclusion: Both the transcriptome and the metabolome analysis revealed that there is a significantly higher impact of protease addition for maltose syrup supplemented fermentations, while addition of glucose syrup to increase the gravity in the wort resulted in increased glucose repression that lead to inhibition of amino acid uptake and hereby inhibited the effect of the protease addition...|$|R

40|$|Beer {{stability}} {{is a critical}} quality parameter and {{a large amount of}} research has attempted to understand and optimise it. The present study focused on the flavour and foam aspects of beer stability and novel methods of analysis were employed to investigate the influence of yeast physiological state, pitching rates, pasteurisation methods and raw materials on these important parameters. Laser scanning confocal microscopy and flow cytometry were used to gain an in-depth understanding of physiological state and protein dynamics of brewing yeast. Yeast cell components such as glycogen, neutral lipids, trehalose, bud scars, DNA and intracellular proteinases were successfully visualised and quantified. Co-localisation studies with a yeast GFP clone expressing proteinase A (Pr A) were conducted to explore expression and excretion of Pr A in a variety of stress situations encountered during wort fermentations. Pr A {{plays a key role in}} the degradation of the hydrophobic polypeptides responsible for the beer foam stability. The impact of flash pasteurisation compared to sterile filtration on Pr A levels, hydrophobic polypeptide content and foam stability has been investigated. Another focus of this study was to elucidate the origin and fate of polypeptides, throughout wort production and fermentation. Special emphasis was placed on the changes in size and/or hydrophobicity of foam active polypeptides throughout the brewing process in order to identify stages in the process where retention of foam active polypeptides and consequently beer foam stability could be increased. It was attempted to determine what proportion of polypeptides found in beer originate from the cereals and the hops and how these polypeptides evolve throughout the brewing process. <b>High</b> and lower <b>gravity</b> <b>beers</b> were compared with regard to their polypeptide distribution and degree of polypeptide glycosylation. Understanding the mechanisms of beer staling is a longstanding research priority of brewers in order to extend beer shelf life. It was attempted to shed light on the mechanisms involved in beer staling, the role of Reactive Oxygen Species and their interaction with thiol groups in beer proteins. Several approaches for inhibiting or retarding oxidation of the beer matrix were explored. Novel methods for the assessment of oxidative stability and content of thiol and carbonyl groups in beer proteins were developed...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>High</b> <b>gravity</b> brewing is a {{perspective}} technique for increasing brewing capacity without significant capital expenditure. In Vietnam, <b>high</b> <b>gravity</b> brewing {{has been carried}} out in some breweries, the specific gravity of wort is up to 16 oPlato (Pt). In this paper, fermentation of the 16 - 22 oPt wort was examined. The obtained results showed that the <b>higher</b> the specific <b>gravity</b> of wort, the longer the fermentation time and the higher the residual substrate content in the green beer. The principal reason was due to high ratio of C/N content in wort. Then some nitrogen sources were alternatively added to the 22 oPt wort. It was showed that the fermentation was significantly accelerated and the alcohol content in the green beer increased. Yeast extract was considered as a suitable nitrogen source for supplementation in <b>high</b> <b>gravity</b> brewing. For the 22 oPt wort, the optimal content of supplementing yeast extract is 90 mgN/litre. 1...|$|R

30|$|In {{the work}} {{described}} here, a water soluble fraction (WSF) generated by steam pretreatment of Douglas-fir at high severity conditions {{was used to}} create a <b>high</b> <b>gravity</b> (<b>high</b> sugar concentration), multi-stress fermentation environment. The steam pretreatment of Douglas-fir, which is a softwood, results in a hemicellulose rich water soluble fraction (WSF) that is rich in hexoses with only small amounts of pentoses. Our objective was to establish a promising set of fermentation parameters for <b>high</b> <b>gravity</b> multi-stress fermentation of the hemicellulose rich water soluble fraction from steam treated Douglas-fir while developing {{a better understanding of the}} physiological/biochemical basis of yeast inhibitor tolerance. As will be detailed later, high cell density inoculations are needed if good ethanol productivity is to be achieved. Some yeast strains, especially those adapted to inhibitor-rich hydrolysates, were capable of both rapid conversion of furans and more efficient fermentation of the Douglas-fir WSF. High initial glucose concentrations also resulted in faster in situ detoxification of HMF. High cell density inoculation with minor supplemental nutrients could result in the successful <b>high</b> <b>gravity</b> multi-stress fermentation of softwood hydrolysates.|$|R
