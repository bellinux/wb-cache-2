40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the external and internal qualities of eggs from local varieties of <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> (Common breed, Bonaparte, White, Grey and Black) of Benin. Twenty –four (24) <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> of <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> of each variety aged of 38 weeks were reared in station and five new-laid eggs were collected daily and analyzed weekly by variety during 8 weeks. It appears that White <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> lay the heaviest eggs while Bonaparte laid the smallest (P< 0. 05). According to the egg size, White <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> were the best followed by Black <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl,</b> Common <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> and Grey <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl.</b> Eggshell color was mostly red bright and dark red.

By the 19 th day of embryonic development, the four tunics, tunica mucosa, submucosa, tunica muscularis, and tunica adventitia/serosa, were beginning to differentiate from the mesenchymal cells and also the primordial oesophageal glands appeared as clusters of cells that invaginate from the epithelium. By the 27 th day, the tunics were clearly differentiated and the primordial glands were fully developed as evident with positive reaction to Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS).

40|$|Good feeding for <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> Cue: Our next report {{comes from}} Blantyre in Malawi, where Patrick Mphaka {{reports on the}} growing {{popularity}} of <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> among village poultry keepers. One reason for this popularity is a reported resistance of <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> in Malawi to a major poultry disease, Newcastle disease, which every year has a devastating impact on unvaccinated poultry flocks. While this reported resistance may reflect a greater hardiness in <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> to some common diseases, <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> are, in fact vulnerable to Newcastle disease, in common with nearly all poultry species, and those keeping <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> should follow appropriate steps to keep their birds disease free. IN:		?Traditionally, popular domestic birds? OUT:		?. Newcastle which troubles our chickens. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 00 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Village headman Magombo Ngondo ending that report on a community <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> project in his village. Please note that while in his experience, <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> are more resistant to Newcastle disease, veterinary advice suggests that <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> are, in fact, vulnerable to the disease, in common with other poultry. Transcript Mphaka	Traditionally, popular domestic birds kept by most people here are chickens. These have their advantages, and, naturally, their disadvantages. One of the most menacing problems for the poor lot of chicken keepers is the seasonal outbreak of Newcastle disease. It is a big problem for most people because though easily preventable when appropriate vaccination is supplied to the birds, most of them can not afford it. The result is death en masse of chickens once or twice each year. 		Due to this problem, most people are turning their attention to alternative birds. To this end, the introduction of <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> in some areas has become handy. To date, there are no locally known diseases which attack <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls.</b> This quality directly solves the problem most bird keepers have been having with chickens. Since the retail price of <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> is higher than that of chickens, it has not been easy for most people to start rearing <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls.</b> There are some instances, however, where Non-Governmental organizations have intervened in introducing the birds to some communities. One such community is in Magombo Ngondo village in Traditional Authority Kuntaja in Blantyre district. The community here was given some twenty birds to keep on community level and that as the birds multiply, they can start sharing amongst themselves. I paid the village headman a visit {{to learn more about the}} feeding practices, among other relevant issues. Ngondo	[Vernac] As far as feeding is concerned, we provide them with food two or three times each day within the stall before we release them to fend for themselves outside. In addition, we also ensure that the water containers which you see there are cleaned and filled with clean water each day. We feed these <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> with maize bran, sorghum, or sometimes we look for white ants, so that we are sure that when they are going to fend for themselves, they have already had enough food. Mphaka	You told me earlier that sometimes these birds are 100 % stall fed, and sometimes, like this period, they are on semi-free range. Would you elaborate on that? Ngondo	We stall feed them 100 % when we have just planted various crops in the fields. This is done to ensure that the planted seeds grow without being eaten away by the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls.</b> As you know, these birds are very notorious with seed, especially maize. Once the seedlings are of good health, and can not be destroyed anymore by the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls,</b> we then put them on semi-free range. Mphaka	These <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> belong to the community. How does the community assist you in taking care of the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> in terms of feeding them and other things? Ngondo	The community assists in several ways. They take turns in making sure that the inside and outside of the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> house is clean. They are also the ones who do the actual feeding of the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls.</b> Mphaka	Would you like to tell me the difference in terms of production of eggs between the times when you are giving them food inside their house, and when you are allowing them to go out free range? Ngondo	They lay eggs more continuously when they are on semi-free range. We think this is because they are able to supplement on the food we give them inside the stall. Again, we think that the space and fresh air which they enjoy outside, give them more freedom which make them healthier. Mphaka	What would you say is the advantage of rearing <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> over chickens? Ngondo	<b>Guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> are better than chickens when it comes to diseases. <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> are resistant to Newcastle which troubles our chickens. End of track.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 30 years, studies of single muscles have {{revealed}} complex patterns of regional variation in muscle architecture, activation, strain and force. In addition, muscles are often functionally integrated with other muscles in parallel or in series.

VA. ” (Cassandro, 2004). A total of 117 unrelated males reared in two nucleus units of CO. VA. project in 2003 were analyzed. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood obtained from 68 ducks (Anas platyrhyncos) belonging to the Mignon and the Germanata Veneta breeds, 28 turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) of two different breeds, Ermellinata and Comune Bronzato, and 21 Camosciata helmeted guinea fowls (Numida meleagris). AFLP genotyping was carried out following the protocol described by Barcaccia et al. (1999), modified for the use of TaqI endonuclease as the “frequent cutter” enzyme. In conclusion, AFLP markers allowed the genetic characterization of the three species; heterozigosity and Gst index can be used to monitor genetic variability within and among breeds, thus providing an important tool in the conservation scheme. In duck, AFLP markers permitted the genetic differentiation within species through cluster analysis and also by means of factorial analysis.

40|$|Locomotion {{arises from}} the complex and coordinated {{function}} of limb muscles. Yet muscle function is dynamic {{over the course of}} a single stride and between strides for animals moving at different speeds or on variable terrain. While it is clear that motor unit recruitment can vary between and within muscles, we know little about how work is distributed within and between muscles under in vivo conditions. Here we show that the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) of <b>helmeted</b> <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> (Numida meleagris) performs considerably more work than its synergist, the medial gastrocnemius (MG) and that the proximal region of the MG (pMG) performs more work than the distal region (dMG). Positive work done by the LG was approximately twice that of the proximal MG when the birds walked at 0. 5  m s− 1, and four times when running at 2. 0  m s− 1. This is probably due to different moments at the knee, as well as differences in motor unit recruitment. The dMG performed less work than the pMG because its apparent dynamic stiffness was greater, and because it exhibited a greater recruitment of slow-twitch fibres. The greater compliance of the pMG leads to increased stretch of its fascicles at the onset of force, further enhancing force production. Our results demonstrate the capacity for functional diversity between and within muscle synergists, which increases with changes in gait and speed...|$|E
40|$|Legged animals {{routinely}} negotiate rough, unpredictable terrain with agility {{and stability}} that outmatches any human-built machine. Yet, we know surprisingly little about how animals accomplish this. Current knowledge is largely limited to studies of steady movement. These studies have revealed fundamental mechanisms used by terrestrial animals for steady locomotion. However, {{it is unclear}} whether these models provide an appropriate framework for the neuromuscular and mechanical strategies used to achieve dynamic stability over rough terrain. Perturbation experiments shed light on this issue, revealing the interplay between mechanics and neuromuscular control. We measured limb mechanics of <b>helmeted</b> <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> (Numida meleagris) running over an unexpected drop in terrain, comparing their response to predictions of the mass–spring running model. Adjustment of limb contact angle explains 80 % of the variation in stance-phase limb loading following the perturbation. Surprisingly, although limb stiffness varies dramatically, it does not influence the response. This result agrees with a mass–spring model, although it differs from previous findings on humans running over surfaces of varying compliance. However, guinea fowl sometimes deviate from mass–spring dynamics through posture-dependent work performance of the limb, leading to substantial energy absorption following the perturbation. This posture-dependent actuation allows the animal to absorb energy and maintain desired velocity on a sudden substrate drop. Thus, posture-dependent work performance of the limb provides inherent velocity control over rough terrain. These findings highlight how simple mechanical models extend to unsteady conditions, providing fundamental insights into neuromuscular control of movement and the design of dynamically stable legged robots and prosthetic devices...|$|E

A total of 50 fresh eggs were collected from the two species. Standard measures {{were used to determine}} physical and chemical characteristics. <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowl's</b> eggs were significantly (P < 0. 01) lower in egg weight, egg length, and egg diameter than Bovans'. There {{were no significant differences in}} shape index, while the specific gravity, shell weight and shell thickness of <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowl's</b> eggs were significantly (P< 0. 01) higher. Yolk and albumen weights of <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowl's</b> eggs showed significantly (P< 0. 01) lower values, while the albumen height, Haugh units and membrane weight were not different. <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowl's</b> eggss tended to have a high percentage of egg yolk and eggshell and lower percentage of egg albumen than Bovans'.

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in Borgou department (northern Benin) to characterize <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> production systems in rural areas. A questionnaire was administered to 70 <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> keepers in order to collect information about <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> management and husbandry practices in the region. This activity was practised according to traditional management in Benin where free range {{is the most common}} system of rearing. Birds scavenged during the day while at night, keets and surrogate hens were housed in poor, cramped coops whereas adult <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> roosted on trees. No rational feeding system was practised. <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> gleaned grass seeds, vegetable leaves, insects, worms, bones and eggshells. Poultry received a supplement consisting of cereals and their by-products, e. g. sorghum (30. 4 %), maize (25. 0 %), rice (14. 3 %), maize bran (7. 1 %), kitchen waste (5. 4 %), sorghum bran (3. 6 %), millet (1. 8 %) and complete food (1. 8 %). Adult body weight was 1121. 3 ± 100. 2 g at 6 months and maximum growth rate of 10. 2 g/day was reached at four months. Point-of-lay was between 7 and 9 months. Local hens were used to incubate <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> eggs, and hatchability was 72. 9 %. The survey revealed that <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> productivity is low because of high keet mortality. Average keet mortality registered from 0 to 6 months was 48 % (range 3 to 100 %). Moreover, 74 % of interviewed farmers reported that keet mortality constituted the major constraint to <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> rearing. Others reported constraints, included keet weakness, poor quality of eggs, egg losses hidden under brush, keets predation, poor housing and infestations. The size of the keet populations varied over the year with the highest proportion in June-July while the proportion of growers increased from September to January. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Crested <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> (Guttera pucherani) {{living in}} West African rainforests give alarm calls to leopards (Panthera pardus) and {{sometimes}} humans (Homo sapiens), two main predators of sympatric Diana monkeys (Cercopithecus diana). When hearing these <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> alarm calls, Diana monkeys respond as if a leopard were present, suggesting that by default the monkeys associate <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> alarm calls {{with the presence}} of a leopard. To assess the monkeys' level of causal understanding, I primed monkeys to the presence of either a leopard or a human, before exposing them to playbacks of <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> alarm calls. There were significant differences in the way leopard-primed groups and human-primed groups responded to <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> alarm calls, suggesting that the monkeys' response was not directly driven by the alarm calls themselves but by the calls' underlying cause, i. e. the predator most likely to have caused the calls. Results are discussed with respect to three possible cognitive mechanisms - associative learning, specialized learning programs, and causal reasoning - that could have led to causal knowledge in Diana monkeys...|$|R
40|$|Several local <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> {{varieties}} {{continued to}} be reared in extensive systems in Benin, even though productivity remains low. Improving rearing conditions through feeding and housing may enhance local <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> productivity in Benin. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to verify growth and carcass performances of five (Common, Bonaparte, Grey, White and Black) local <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> varieties under intensive management conditions. At birth, 36 keets (young <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls)</b> of each identified variety were randomly divided into six batches and reared up to 16 weeks old under the same feeding and housing conditions. Body weights were recorded up to week 15. At week 16, carcass measurements were also taken. Growth performances and carcass measurements (morphological and visceral) differed among <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> varieties. The heaviest body weight was observed in Common (832 ± 24 g) and the lowest in Black variety (698 ± 39 g). Highest carcass yield was observed in Grey variety. Liver weight, intestine length and caecum length were highest in Bonaparte variety. Gizzard weight and thigh proportion were highest in Common variety. Breast weight and breast proportion were highest in Grey <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls.</b> Body weight was moderately correlated with drumstick length, body length, wing size, tarsus diameter, thigh length and thorax circumference (range r = 0. 34 - 0. 60). The phenotypic variability and its impact on the characterization of these varieties implies that they are genetically different strains, supporting the hypothesis that the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> population in Benin presents opportunities for genetic improvement.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to assess the}} effect of dietary {{substitution}} of soybean meal (SBM) with dehulled-micronized faba bean (Vicia faba var. minor) in <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> broilers on their growth traits, carcass quality, and meat fatty acids composition. In this trial, 120 day-old <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> keets {{were randomly assigned to}} two treatments which were fed from hatch to 12 weeks of age. Birds were fed two wheat middlings-based diets comprising of a control treatment which contained SBM (78. 3 g/kg) and a test diet containing dehulled-micronized faba bean (130 g/kg) as the main protein source. Substituting SBM with faba bean had no adverse effect on growth traits, dressing percentage, or breast and thigh muscles relative weight of the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls.</b> Conversely, a decrease (p< 0. 05) of abdominal fat was found in <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> fed the faba bean-diet. Breast muscle of birds fed faba bean had higher L* score (p< 0. 05) and water-holding capacity (p< 0. 05) than the SBM control diet. Meat from <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> fed faba bean had less total lipids (p< 0. 05) and cholesterol (p< 0. 01), and higher concentrations of phospholipids (p< 0. 01). Feeding faba bean increased polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations in breast meat and decreased the saturated fatty acid levels. Moreover, dietary faba bean improved the atherogenic and thrombogenic indexes in <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> breast meat. Results indicated that substitution of SBM with faba bean meal in <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> diet can improve carcass qualitative traits, enhancing also meat lipid profile without negatively affecting growth performance...|$|R
40|$|Morphometric and {{macroscopic}} {{studies were}} carried out on the respiratory system of the West African <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> (WAGF). The gross anatomical study revealed that the laryngeal mound of the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> was roughly triangular in shape extending rostrally {{from the base of the}} skull and continues caudally as the trachea. It had only one row of caudally pointing papillae. The larger cartilaginous rings of the trachea bifurcated at the ventrum while the smaller cartilaginous rings did not bifurcate. The investigation also revealed that the lung of the adult <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> had the shape of a trapezium. The morphometric result obtained revealed that the mean (± SE) life weights of the male and female adult <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> were 1. 357 kg and 1. 225 kg, respectively. The mean (± SE) weights of the respiratory system were 9. 638 g and 8. 500 g for male and female birds respectively. The mean (± SE) lengths from the thoracic inlet to the tracheal bifurcation for male and female birds were 3. 26 cm and 4. 40 cm, respectively. The male <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> was significantly heavier (p 0. 05) in the mean weights of the respiratory system of the male and female birds.
