30|$|It can be {{observed}} from Figure  8 and Table  7 that the front part of the <b>front</b> <b>mount</b> frame has a maximum deformation of 0.82  mm, mainly {{because there are no}} rubber blocks. The stress in the <b>front</b> <b>mount</b> is mainly distributed in the six bolt holes and two sides of the vertical part of the metal frame, and the bolt hole of the horizontal part has a maximum stress of 82.017  MPa. Compared with the left and right <b>mounts,</b> the <b>front</b> <b>mount</b> has larger deformation and stress, and is more easily damaged during use, and hence, it is necessary to improve the reliability of the <b>front</b> <b>mount.</b>|$|R

30|$|It can be {{observed}} from Figure  11 that the root-mean-square values of the vibration acceleration {{before and after the}} optimization are 4.84 g and 0.82 g, respectively, indicating a reduction of 83 % and hence, the vibration is evidently attenuated. This is because we optimize both the rubber and metal frame of the <b>front</b> <b>mount,</b> which changes the ratio of stiffness of the metal frame to that of the rubber. The figure of frequency domain also shows that the vibration optimal decoupling and topology optimization can evidently attenuate the vibration of the <b>front</b> <b>mount,</b> especially in the frequency band of 1250  Hz.|$|R
50|$|<b>Front</b> <b>mounted</b> {{longitudinal}} engines with {{rear-wheel drive}} (FR) {{is a common}} layout of luxury cars. European marques like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Jaguar have almost never adopted <b>front</b> <b>mounted</b> engines with front-wheel drive (FF) and retained a lineup mostly or entirely made up of FR cars. Japanese brands such as Lexus and Infiniti also have predominantly FR lineups. The FR layout, while {{more expensive than the}} FF, has been retained by these luxury manufacturers as it allows for higher performance engines (particularly the straight-6, V8, and other engine configurations with more cylinders), better handling, and a smoother ride.|$|R

40|$|Pigeon pea or tur (Cajanus cajan L. Mills.) {{is one of}} the {{important}} pulse crops of India and ranks second to chickpea in area and production. Traditionally the harvesting of pigeon pea is done manually by sickle, which demands considerable amount of labour, drudgery, time and cost to harvest, which reflects on total production cost of the crop. In view of this a tractor operated <b>front</b> <b>mounted</b> pigeon pea stem cutter was developed and being <b>front</b> <b>mounted</b> implement it facilitated better visibility and control to operator. The power was transmitted from pto to gear box. Arrangement of hydraulic cylinder and hydraulic motor was provided on the equipment to facilitate the height of cut and to rotate the conveyer belt. During comparative performance evaluation of developed equipment, the average cutting efficiency and field capacity was found 96. 30 % and 0. 176 ha/hr respectively. There was increase in fuel consumption and plant damage with increase in speed of operation. The average operation cost of newly developed tractor operated <b>front</b> <b>mounted</b> pigeon pea stem cutter was 64. 71 % less as compared with manual harvesting of pigeon pea crop. The time saved was almost 1 / 3 rd to that of manual harvesting...|$|R
