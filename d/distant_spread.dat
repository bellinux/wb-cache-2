25|$|Breast {{cancer is}} cancer that {{develops}} from breast tissue. Signs {{of breast cancer}} may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, or a red scaly patch of skin. In those with <b>distant</b> <b>spread</b> of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin.|$|E
25|$|Breast cancers {{occur during}} {{pregnancy}} {{at the same}} rate as breast cancers in non-pregnant women of the same age.

40|$|Esthesioneuroblastoma {{is a rare}} tumour, {{for which}} a {{multimodal}} approach, including a combination of surgery and radiation, appears {{to provide the best}} disease-free and overall survival. Well-known for its tendency for local recurrence and <b>distant</b> <b>spreading</b> by both lymphatic and haematogenous routes, the most common sites of metastases are lungs and bones, followed by liver, spleen, scalp, breast, adrenals and ovary. One single case of metastasis to the trachea has been reported in the literature.

40|$|We present {{here the}} first case of {{successful}} management via preoperative ultrasonographic (US) study to detect a <b>distant</b> <b>spreading</b> of Fournier’s gangrene (FG), which was happened in a 75 -year-old man. US study showed the necrotizing infection in the periumbilical region distant 22 cm from the genital tract. A target incision of this periumbilical area and debridement of necrotic tissues was made. Computed tomography (CT) is superior to ultrasonography to confirm the diagnosis of FG and support in surgical management, but a CT evaluation in patients with FG may be limited by the frequent presence of concurrent acute renal failure or patient hemodynamic instability. Ultrasonography is an ideal technique for evaluating patients in bedside settings and can be routinely used in an emergency...|$|R
40|$|Squamous and adenosquamous cell carcinomas (ASC and SCC) {{are rare}} subtypes of {{gallbladder}} cancer, traditionally considered more aggressive {{and with a}} poorer prognosis than adenocarcinoma. We report about two patients affected by an advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the gallbladder. Both had a large tumour in the gallbladder fossa region with infiltration of the liver. Surgical resection was radical in one, but palliative in the other. pTNM was T 3 N 0 M 0, G 3, R 0 in the former and T 3 N 0 M 0, G 2 R 1 in the latter. Patients died for local recurrence after 12 and 5 months, respectively. Natural history, clinical findings, prognosis and outcome of this rare gallbladder tumour are discussed {{on the basis of}} a review of the English literature. In conclusion, an aggressive and radical surgical treatment of advanced squamous and adenosquamous cell gallbladder carcinomas seems to be indicated for their low proclivity to <b>distant</b> <b>spreading...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To analyze {{a series}} of {{patients}} with periorbital perineural spread of squamous cell carcinoma and propose treatment guidelines. Methods: Retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series of 17 patients with clinical, radiologic, or histologic evidence of <b>distant</b> perineural <b>spread.</b> Treatment, recurrence, progression, and mortality rates were recorded. Results: Numbness and pain were the most common symptoms, whereas ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and facial palsy were the most frequent signs. All cases received wide-field radiotherapy to at least 50 Gy. Chemotherapy and surgery (biopsy, debulking, exenteration) were used in selected cases. Disease progression occurred in 6 patients, 4 of whom died. Median disease-free survival in the remainder was 37. 5 months. Conclusions: The diagnosis of perineural spread is largely clinical and may be confirmed with imaging findings {{in the majority of}} cases. The role of biopsy is usually complementary but may be essential in some cases. In patients with evidence of <b>distant</b> perineural <b>spread,</b> radiotherapy volumes inclusive of potential antegrade and retrograde spread are recommended. Three-dimensional conformal planning or intensity-modulated radiation therapy assists in minimizing damage to adjacent structures. Synchronous chemotherapy should be considered to potentiate the effectiveness of radiation. The place of surgery in the treatment of perineural spread is palliative...|$|R
50|$|There are two schemes {{commonly}} used to stage prostate cancer. The most common is promulgated by the American Joint Committee on Cancer, and {{is known as the}} TNM system, which evaluates the size of the tumor, the extent of involved lymph nodes, and any metastasis (<b>distant</b> <b>spread)</b> and also takes into account cancer grade. As with many other cancers, these are often grouped into four stages (I - IV). Another scheme, now used less commonly for research, but often still used by clinicians, is the Whitmore-Jewett stage.|$|E

50|$|As of 2015, about 2.2 {{million people}} have cSCC at any given time. It makes up about 20% of all skin cancer cases. About 12% of males and 7% of females in the United States {{developed}} cSCC {{at some point in}} time. While prognosis is usually good, if <b>distant</b> <b>spread</b> occurs five year survival is ~34%. In 2015 it resulted in about 51,900 deaths globally. The usual age at diagnosis is around 66. Following the successful treatment of one case of cSCC people are at high risk of developing further cases.|$|E
40|$|Carcinoid of the {{appendix}} occurred in 92 of 400, 000 surgical pathology specimens covering 70 years, and followed previously reported incidences by age, sex, symptoms, size, localization and histology. Invasion of the mesoappendix occurred in 13 cases, {{and in two}} of these, a reoperative ileocolectomy demonstrated regional node metastases. No distant metastases or fatalities appeared. Tumor size correlated with mesoappendiceal invasion.

30|$|Dissemination of PFTC occurs {{through the}} transcoelomic route with {{implantation}} of cells throughout the abdominal cavity, similarly to ovarian cancer, and also through continuity to adjacent organs, transluminal migration, haematogenous, and lymphatic <b>spread.</b> <b>Distant</b> metastases {{are more common}} in PFTC than ovarian cancer [28, 36, 41], but a biopsy of such lesions would not distinguish them with certainty [41].|$|R
40|$|Antiangiogenic {{treatment}} has recently {{become an integral}} part of modern cancer therapy targeting the vasculature of numerous aggressive malignancies including glioblastoma. There is preclinical evidence that antiangiogenic therapies promote glioma cell invasiveness. In clinical series, upon progression on antiangiogenic therapy with the vascular endothelial growth factor-directed antibody bevacizumab (BEV), glioblastoma has been reported to display a more infiltrative pattern of recurrence. This <b>distant</b> <b>spread</b> at recurrence or progression and a gliomatosis cerebri-like growth pattern is best detectable on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI. The frequency of up to 20 % to 30 % of such a pattern in BEV-treated patients is higher than expected to occur without BEV. Older reports and common clinical knowledge estimate the frequency of diffuse or <b>distant</b> <b>spread</b> in recurrent glioblastoma at 10 %. This observation stimulated two streams of research. One is to overcome this often insidious adverse effect of antiangiogenic treatment, to optimize antiangiogenic therapies and to face this major challenge, integrating antiangiogenic with anti-invasive mechanisms into one combined treatment concept. The second is questioning a specific property of antiangiogenic therapy to induce diffuse or <b>distant</b> <b>spread.</b> Here, alternative hypotheses of increased awareness and better imaging as well as invasiveness being part of the natural course of the disease have been tested. Without doubt, migration and invasiveness are major obstacles to successful glioma therapy, notably local therapies, both in the natural course of the disease and in the concept of "evasive resistance. " However, clinical analyses of case series, matched pairs analyses, and follow-up on the BRAIN trial (A Study to Evaluate Bevacizumab Alone or in Combination with Irinotecan for Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme), which led to accelerated approval of BEV for recurrent glioblastoma in the United States, have not supported a specific propensity of BEV to induce diffuse growth or <b>distant</b> <b>spread</b> at recurrence...|$|E
40|$|Although {{endometrial cancer}} is surgicopathologically staged, {{preoperative}} imaging {{is recommended for}} diagnostic work-up to tailor surgery and adjuvant treatment. For preoperative staging, imaging by transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is valuable to assess local tumor extent, and positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) and/or computed tomography (CT) to assess lymph node metastases and <b>distant</b> <b>spread.</b> Preoperative imaging may identify deep myometrial invasion, cervical stromal involvement, pelvic and/or paraaortic lymph node metastases, and <b>distant</b> <b>spread,</b> however, with reported limitations in accuracies and reproducibility. Novel structural and functional imaging techniques offer visualization of microstructural and functional tumor characteristics, reportedly linked to clinical phenotype, thus with a potential for improving risk stratification.

30|$|Even though {{guidelines}} clearly {{state that}} routine imaging for {{low back pain}} is not considered appropriate, an important exception is made for patients who also report “red flags” symptoms that may conceal malignancy, infection, or other systemic disease (Clearinghouse National Guideline, n.d.). Presence {{of one of the}} following symptoms should raise the suspicion of malignancy: a history of cancer, unexplained weight loss, age over 50  years or under 17  years old, failure to improve with therapy, pain persisting for more than 4 – 6  weeks, night pain or pain at rest. In case of focal hip uptake, SPECT/CT can be particularly useful to differentiate avascular necrosis (Fig. 7 c) and osteoarthritis (Fig. 7 d) from malignant bone disease (Fig. 7 e). Similarly, persistent fever, history of intravenous drug abuse, severe pain, lumbar spine surgery within 1  year, recent bacterial infection, bacteraemia, or an immunocompromised state should prompt a work-up to rule-out occult infection. Both FDG-PET/CT and bone scintigraphy, as well as MRI or CT can be used to detect malignancy. For detecting occult infection, in spondylitis and spondylodiscitis, FDG-PET/CT can be used, especially when suspecting <b>distant</b> <b>spreading</b> (van der Bruggen et al. 2010). In spondylitis and spondylodiscitis the accuracy of using white blood cells (WBC) labeled with either Indium or Technetium is inadequate, with limited penetration of leukocytes and high physiological bone marrow activity, leading to low sensitivity in spinal pathology. In contrast, suspected infection after metallic implants outside of the spine can be visualized with optimal accuracy using WBC and bone marrow imaging (van der Bruggen et al. 2010).|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{transcription}} factor SOX 2, which {{is involved in}} the induction of pluripotent stem cells and contributes to colorectal carcinogenesis, is associated with a poor prognosis in colon cancer (CC). Furthermore, SOX 2 is a repressor of the transcriptional activity of β-catenin in vitro. Since the majority of CC develop via an activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway, indicated by nuclear expression of β-catenin, we wanted to investigate the expression patterns of SOX 2 and β-catenin and correlate them with the occurrence of lymph node and distant metastases as indicators of malignant progression. Methods The expression of SOX 2 and β-catenin was investigated in a case control study utilizing a matched pair collection (N = 114) of right-sided CCs with either corresponding distant metastases (N = 57) or without <b>distant</b> <b>spread</b> (N = 57) by applying immunohistochemistry. Results Elevated protein expression of SOX 2 significantly correlated with the presence of lymph node- (p = 0. 006) and distant metastases (p = 0. 022). Nuclear β-catenin expression correlated significantly only with distant metastases (p = 0. 001). Less than 10 % of cases showed a coexpression of high levels of β-catenin and SOX 2. The positivity for both markers was also associated with a very high risk for lymph-node metastases (p = 0. 007) and <b>distant</b> <b>spread</b> (p = 0. 028). Conclusion We demonstrated that increased expression of either SOX 2 or nuclear β-catenin are associated with distant metastases in right-sided CC. Additionally, SOX 2 is also associated with lymph-node metastases. These data underline the importance of stemness-associated markers for the identification of CC with high risk for <b>distant</b> <b>spread.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Adrenocortical {{carcinoma}} (ACC) is a rare, aggressive tumor {{arising from}} the adrenal cortex that typically presents late with a large mass. The increased use of cross-sectional imaging for unrelated reasons {{has led to a}} greater number of ACCs being detected incidentally at an earlier stage. Recognition of the typical clinical, biochemical, and imaging findings is imperative for rapid diagnosis, prompt intervention, and early use of the appropriate therapy. CONCLUSION: Cross-sectional imaging with CT and MRI is essential for determining the extent of local and <b>distant</b> tumor <b>spread.</b> Complete surgical resection is currently the only potentially curative treatment of ACC, and the information attained from CT and MRI is important to guide surgery and further patient management...|$|R
30|$|Microvessel {{density in}} NSCLC is {{associated}} with <b>distant</b> metastatic <b>spread</b> and poor survival [37]. In other tumors, {{there is evidence that}} the degree of vascularization decreases with the grade of differentiation [38]. Several previous studies have shown that DCE measurements of lung cancer correlate with the histopathological assessment of tumor vascularization such as MVD [36, 39, 40]. The failure to demonstrate a relationship between CTP parameters and MVD in the present study is likely due to our study setting, as we covered tumors of any size rather than focusing on small malignant nodules, which are usually removed surgically and qualify for MVD analysis, whereas larger tumors are often irradiated. Additionally, the association between CTP and MVD might also depend on the histopathological method used [41 – 44].|$|R

30|$|The {{ability to}} select {{patients}} for lymphadenectomy prior to surgery may, therefore, be of value. Imaging {{can assist in}} preoperative assessment and surgical planning by predicting the depth of myometrial invasion, cervical stromal involvement, <b>distant</b> <b>spread</b> and lymph-node involvement. Preoperative knowledge of these factors is important, as patients with disease greater than FIGO Stage 1 A may benefit from lymphadenectomy, {{but the number of}} unnecessary lymph-node dissections can also be reduced in low risk patients by showing that none of these factors are present [27].|$|E
