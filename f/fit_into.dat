5|$|By January 1957, {{with the}} tests just months away, a {{tentative}} schedule had emerged. Short Granite would be fired first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would be fired next. Because Short Granite was {{too large to}} <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> a missile or guided bomb, this would occur whether or not Short Granite was a success. Finally, Green Granite would be tested. In December 1956, Cook had proposed another design, known as Green Granite II. This was smaller than Green Granite I, and could <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> a Yellow Sun casing {{that could be used}} by the Blue Steel guided missile then under development; but it could not be made ready to reach Christmas Island before 26 June 1957, and extending Operation Grapple would cost another £1.5 million.|$|E

5|$|Crocodilian teeth {{vary from}} blunt and dull to sharp and needle-like. Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform. The teeth of {{crocodiles}} and gharials {{tend to be}} more visible than those of alligators and caimans when the jaws are closed. The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. The teeth on the lower jaw of an alligator <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> sockets in the upper jaw, so only the upper teeth are visible when the mouth is closed. The teeth on the lower jaw of a crocodile <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> grooves {{on the outside of the}} top jaw making both the upper and lower teeth visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E

5|$|Among other reforms was the Codex Theresianus, {{begun in}} 1752 and {{finished}} in 1766, that defined civil rights. In 1776, Austria outlawed witch burnings and torture. It was later reintroduced, but the liberal {{nature of these}} reforms remains noted. Much unlike Joseph, but {{with the support of}} religious authorities, Maria Theresa was opposed to the abolition of torture. Born and raised between Baroque and Rococo eras, she found it hard to <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> the intellectual sphere of the Enlightenment, which is why she only slowly followed humanitarian reforms on the continent.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1944, the M3 {{had fallen}} out of favor even with {{airborne}} troops, despite their strong preference for compact and lightweight weapon systems. The Airborne Command had rejected the 57mm M1 in the summer of 1943 claiming its unfitness for airlifting and the Table of Organisation and Equipment (TO) of February 1944 still had airborne divisions keeping their 37mm guns. Nevertheless, the 82nd and the 101st, were reequipped with British-manufactured 6-pounder gun (57mm) on carriage Mk III (designed to <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> the British Horsa glider) for the Normandy airdrops. This change was officially introduced in the TO of December 1944.|$|E
5|$|Domestic American {{alligators}} {{range from}} long and slender to short and robust, possibly due to variations in {{factors such as}} growth rate, diet, and climate. American alligators have broad snouts, especially in captive individuals. When the jaws are closed, {{the edges of the}} upper jaws cover the lower teeth which <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> the jaws' hollows. Like the spectacled caiman, this species has a bony nasal ridge, though it is less prominent. The teeth number 74–80. Dorsally, adult American alligators may be olive, brown, gray, or black in color, while their undersides are cream-colored.|$|E
