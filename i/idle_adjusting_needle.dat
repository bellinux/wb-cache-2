50|$|Mullite {{morphology}} is {{also important}} for its application. In this case, there are two common morphologies for mullite. One is a platelet shape with low aspect ratio {{and the second is}} a needle shape with high aspect ratio. If the needle shape mullite can form in a ceramic body during sintering, it has an effect on both the mechanical and physical properties by increasing the mechanical strength and thermal shock resistance. The most important condition relates to ceramic chemical composition. If the silica and alumina ratio with low basic materials such as sodium and calcium is <b>adjusted,</b> the <b>needle</b> shape mullite forms at about 1400 °C and the needles will interlock. This mechanical interlocking contributes to the high mechanical strength of porcelain.|$|R

50|$|The {{carburetion}} on most control-line engines is {{a simple}} fixed-size orifice (venturi) with only a mixture ratio adjustment. The engine can be run over a very wide range of mixtures and <b>adjusting</b> the <b>needle</b> valve {{can be used to}} adjust the engine speed over a small range. Once released, the engine runs at a more-or-less constant speed until the fuel runs out, or, if equipped, the fuel-shutoff is activated. Altering the size of the venturi used can be used to adjust the gross power. Two-stroke glow motors can be made to run in a 4-stroke mode where the engine mis-fires on every other stroke, and changes mode of firing based on load of the propeller. A tremendous degree of control over how the engine runs in flight is possible by altering the fuel contents, propeller size, pitch, and pitch distribution, venturi size, compression ratio of the engine, and the length of the tuned exhaust, if used.|$|R

A new generation method of digital micro-fluid is proposed in this paper. An interdigital transducer (IDT) and a reflector were fabricated on 128 0 YX-LiNbO 3 substrate, {{which was used}} to excited surface acoustic wave. A needle with 400 um inside diameter connected with a syringe was on the piezoelectric substrate, of which space could be <b>adjusted.</b> The <b>needle</b> tip and the piezoelectric substrate were coated with Teflon AF 1600.

When the flow velocity of the syringe being 2. 269 mm/min, space between the needle tip and the substrate being 0. 98 mm and 34 mdB RF signal power, the volume of the generated water digital micro-fluid is 2 ul. Change the space and RF signal power, the volume of generated water digital micro-fluid is also different.

30|$|A {{custom-made}} particle seeder, {{which included}} a particle container, inlet and outlet tubes, was used to seed the flow with various nanoenergetic materials. Mass measurements, before and after each run, were used to estimate the particle flow rates. Usually about 5  g of aluminum or iron nanoenergetics (nominal diameters of 70  nm, purchased from NanoAmor Inc., Houston, USA, without further treatment) were placed along the flow path inside the particle container. The particle seeder inlet tube was submerged {{below the surface of}} the piles to generate particle suspensions inside the container. The height of the inlet and outlet were offset to ensure roughly uniform seeding in the flow through the discharge tube. Standard breathing dry air was used as the gas supply. A flow controller (FMA 5400, Omega, Stamford, USA) regulated the flow rate in the system to 1 [*]±[*] 0.1 standard liters per minute (slpm). A three-way valve allowed the flow to be switched between the nanoparticle seeder and a bypass line. If particle seeding was desired, the three-way valve and needle valve were opened to allow flow through the seeder. Otherwise, the three-way valve and needle valve were closed to isolate the particle seeder. The pressure in the system was monitored downstream of the cell by a piezoelectric pressure sensor (Series 910, Kurt J. Lesker Company, Jefferson Hills, USA), and the desired pressure was obtained by <b>adjusting</b> the <b>needle</b> valve upstream of the vacuum pump.|$|R

The TALBP-II is NP-hard, and some assignment restrictions in real applications make this problem much more complex. This paper provides an integer programming model for solving the TALBP-II with assignment restrictions optimally and utilizes a simple and effective iterated greedy (IG) algorithm to address large-size problems. This algorithm utilizes a new local search by considering precedence relationships between tasks {{in order to reduce}} the computational time. In particular, a priority-based decoding scheme is developed to handle these assignment restrictions and reduce sequence-dependent <b>idle</b> times by <b>adjusting</b> the priority values. Experimental comparison among the proposed decoding scheme and other published ones demonstrates the efficiency of the priority-based decoding.

40|$|CT-fluoroscopy (CTF) is an {{efficient}} imaging method for guiding percutaneous lung interventions such as biopsy. During CTF-guided biopsy procedure, four to ten axial sectional images are captured {{in a very}} short time period to provide nearly real-time feedback to physicians, so that they can <b>adjust</b> the <b>needle</b> as it is advanced towards the target lesion. Although popularly used in clinics, this traditional CTF-guided intervention procedure may require frequent scans and cause unnecessary radiation exposure to clinicians and patients. In addition, CTF only generates limited slices of images and provides limited anatomical information. It also has limited response to respiratory movements and has narrow local anatomical dynamics. To better utilize CTF guidance, we propose a fast CT-CTF registration algorithm with respiratory motion estimation for image-guided lung intervention using electromagnetic (EM) guidance. With the pre-procedural exhale and inhale CT scans, it would be possible to estimate a series of CT images of the same patient at different respiratory phases. Then, once a CTF image is captured during the intervention, our algorithm can pick the best respiratory phase-matched 3 D CT image and performs a fast deformable registration to warp the 3 D CT toward the CTF. The new 3 D CT image can be used to guide the intervention by superimposing the EM-guided needle location on it. Compared to the traditional repetitive CTF guidance, the registered CT integrates both 3 D volumetric patient data and nearly real-time local anatomy for more effective and efficient guidance.

50|$|Glow plugs {{are used}} for {{starting}} as well as continuing the power cycle. The glow plug consists of a durable, mostly platinum, helically wound wire filament, within a cylindrical pocket in the plug body, exposed to the combustion chamber. A small direct current voltage (around 1.5 volts) {{is applied to the}} glow plug, the engine is then started, and the voltage is removed. The burning of the fuel/air mixture in a glow-plug model engine, which requires methanol for the glow plug to work in the first place, and sometimes with the use of nitromethane for greater power output and steadier idle, occurs due to the catalytic reaction of the methanol vapor to the presence of the platinum in the filament, thus causing the ignition. This keeps the plug's filament glowing hot, and allows it to ignite the next charge. Since the ignition timing is not controlled electrically, as in a spark ignition engine or by fuel injection, as in an ordinary diesel, it must be adjusted by the richness of the mixture, the ratio of nitromethane to methanol, the compression ratio, the cooling of the cylinder head, the type of glow plug, etc. A richer mixture will tend to cool the filament and so retard ignition, slowing the engine, and a rich mixture also eases starting. After starting the engine can easily be leaned (by <b>adjusting</b> a <b>needle</b> valve in the spraybar) to obtain maximum power. Glowplug engines are also known as nitro engines. Nitro engines require a 1.5 volt ignitor to light the glow plug in the heat sink. Once primed, pulling the starter with the ignitor in will start the engine.|$|R

An experiment was carried out that illustrates the important distinction between gas modifiers present as unregulated contaminants and modifiers added in a controlled manner. The effect of contamination was simulated by <b>adjusting</b> the ESI <b>needle</b> position to promote incomplete desolvation, thereby permitting ESI solvent vapor into the FAIMS analyzer region, causing signal instability and irreproducible CV values.

A literature survey was conducted of driver behavior influences, and pertinent factors from on-road experiments with different driving styles were observed. This effort highlighted important driver influences such as surrounding vehicle behavior, anxiety over trying to get somewhere quickly, and the power/torque available from the vehicle. Existing feedback approaches often deliver efficiency information and instruction. Three recommendations for maximizing fuel savings from potential drive cycle improvement are: (1) leveraging applications with enhanced incentives, (2) using an approach that is easy and widely deployable to motivate drivers, and (3) utilizing connected vehicle and automation technologies to achieve large and widespread efficiency improvements...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} {{research}} {{study was to determine}} the most effective way of treating sacroiliac joint dysfunction with associated gluteus medius trigger points, using adjusting of the sacroiliac joint or needling of the gluteus medius muscle or both. The participants were recruited randomly and placed in 3 different groups. Participants in group 1 were treated with an adjustment of the sacroiliac joint, as well as needling of the most prominent gluteus medius trigger point. Participants in group 2 were adjusted only and participants in group 3 were needled only. The treatment of the participants took place at the University of Johannesburg’s chiropractic day clinic. The objective data was acquired using a Digital Inclinometer to measure the ranges of motion at the spinal levels of the 5 th lumbar vertebra and the first sacral vertebra (L 5 / S 1). An Algometer was used to measure the amount of pressure required to evoke pain, within the most prominent trigger point being treated. The subjective data was acquired using the Oswestry Pain and Disability Questionnaire, as well as the Numerical Pain Rating Scale. The results of the trial were of no statistical significance, but clinical improvement in both objective and subjective data was found. Group 2 ’s mean value percentage improvement was the greatest, when looking at range of motion. Group 1 ’s mean value percentage improvement was the greatest, with the Algometer and the subjective readings. The outcome of this study was that overall all three treatment protocols had a positive effect on the participants. Group 1 and group 2 had a slightly greater overall improvement. Thus it is suggested that when treating sacroiliac joint dysfunction with associated gluteus medius trigger points, the doctor can use an adjustment or <b>adjusting</b> with <b>needling,</b> both are effective.

Finally, steerability and shape sensing are integrated in a robotic system for needle steering in MRI-guided percutaneous interventions in the liver. The master-slave system comprises a steerable needle equipped with FBGs for tracking and a piezoelectric actuator unit.

40|$|Currently, the {{hydroelectric}} {{generating sets}} of small HPPs with Pelton turbines employ as their generating units conventional synchronous generators with electromagnetic excitation. To {{deal with the}} torque pulsatile behaviour, they generally install a supplementary flywheel on the system shaft that levels the pulsations. The Pelton turbine power output is <b>adjusted</b> by the <b>needle</b> changing water flow in the nozzle, whose advancement modifies the nozzle area and eventually – the flow. They limit the needle full stroke time to 20 – 40 sec. since quick shutting the nozzle for swift water flow reduction may result in pressure surges. For quick power adjustment so-called deflectors are employed, whose task is retraction of water jets from the Pelton turbine buckets. Thus, the mechanical method of power output regulation requires agreement between the needle stroke inside the turbine nozzles and the deflector. The paper offers employing frequency-controlled synchronous machines with permanent magnets qua generating units for the hydroelectric generating sets of small HPPs with Pelton turbines. The developed computer model reveals that this provides {{a higher level of}} adjustability towards rapid-changing loads in the grid. Furthermore, this will replace the power output mechanical control involving the valuable deflector drive and the turbine nozzle needles with electrical revolution rate and power output regulation by a frequency converter located in the generator stator circuit. Via frequency start, the controllable synchronous machine ensures stable operation of the hydroelectric generating set with negligibly small amount of water (energy carrier). Finally, in complete absence of water, the frequency-relay start facilitates shifting the generator operation to the synchronous capacitor mode, which the system operating parameter fluctograms obtained through computer modeling prove.  </p...|$|R
