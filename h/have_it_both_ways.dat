40|$|Philosophical anarchists {{have made}} their living criticizing {{theories}} of state legitimacy and the duty to obey the law. The most prominent theories of state legitimacy have been called into doubt by the anarchists' insistence that citizens' lack of consent to the state renders the whole justificatory enterprise futile. Autonomy requires consent, they argue, and justification must respect autonomy. In this essay, I want {{to call into question}} the weight of consent in protecting our capacity for autonomy. I argue that if we care about all of the preconditions for autonomy, then we have good reasons to leave the state of nature. This leaves the philosophical anarchist with a dilemma. If she truly cares about autonomy, then she must welcome the state. But if she wants to deny the legitimacy of the state because of the value of consent, then she needs to downplay the moral significance of autonomy in people's lives. If autonomy matters, the state does too. If it doesn't, then consent doesn't. The philosophical anarchist can't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>both</b> <b>way...</b>|$|R
6000|$|Instruction of the British farmer {{begins with}} the {{fortification}} of his will by confidence. When you ask him to plough up grass land, to revise the rotation of his crops, to grow wheat, to use new brands of corn, to plough with tractors, and to co-operate, you are asking a man deeply and deservedly cynical about your intentions and your knowledge. He has seen wheat fail all his life, he has seen grass succeed. Grass has saved him, {{and now he is}} asked to turn his back on it. Little wonder that he curses you for a meddling fool. [...] "Prove it!" [...] he says--and you cannot. You could if you had it in your power to show him that your guarantee of a fair price for wheat was [...] "good as the Bank." [...] Thus, the first item of instruction to the farmer consists in the definite alteration of public opinion towards the land by adoption of the sine quâ non that in future we will feed ourselves. The majority of our farmers do not think their interests are being served by the present revolution of farming. Patriotic fear for the country, and dread of D.O.R.A.--not quite the same thing--are driving them on. Besides, it is the townsmen of Britain, not the farmers, who are in danger of starvation, not merely now, but henceforth for evermore until we feed ourselves. If starvation really knocked at our doors, the only houses it would not enter would be the houses of those who grow food. The farmers in Germany are all right; they would be all right here. The townsmen of this country were entirely responsible for our present condition, and the very least they can do is to support their own salvation. But while with one corner of their mouths the towns are now shouting: [...] "Grow food! Feed us, please!" [...] with the other they are still inclined to add: [...] "You pampered industry!"

6000|$|Soames {{passed into}} the corner where, side by side, hung his real Goya and the copy of the fresco [...] "La Vendimia." [...] His {{acquisition}} of the real Goya rather beautifully illustrated the cobweb of vested interests and passions which mesh the bright-winged fly of human life. The real Goya's noble owner's ancestor had come into possession of it during some Spanish war--it was in a word loot. The noble owner had remained in ignorance of its value until in the nineties an enterprising critic discovered that a Spanish painter named Goya was a genius. It was only a fair Goya, but almost unique in England, and the noble owner became a marked man. Having many possessions and that aristocratic culture which, independent of mere sensuous enjoyment, is founded on the sounder principle that one must know everything and be fearfully interested in life, he had fully intended to keep an article which contributed to his reputation while he was alive, and to {{leave it to the}} nation after he was dead. Fortunately for Soames, the House of Lords was violently attacked in 1909, and the noble owner became alarmed and angry. 'If,' he said to himself, 'they think they can <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>both</b> <b>ways</b> they are very much mistaken. So long as they leave me in quiet enjoyment the nation can have some of my pictures at my death. But if the nation is going to bait me, and rob me like this, I'm damned if I won't sell the lot. They can't have my private property and my public spirit-both.' He brooded in this fashion for several months till one morning, after reading the speech of a certain statesman, he telegraphed to his agent to come down and bring Bodkin. On going over the collection Bodkin, than whose opinion on market values none was more sought, pronounced that with a free hand to sell to America, Germany, and other places where there was an interest in art, a lot more money could be made than by selling in England. The noble owner's public spirit--he said--was well known but the pictures were unique. The noble owner put this opinion in his pipe and smoked it for a year. At the end of that time he read another speech by the same statesman, and telegraphed to his agents: [...] "Give Bodkin a free hand." [...] It was at this juncture that Bodkin conceived the idea which saved the Goya and two other unique pictures for the native country of the noble owner. With one hand Bodkin proffered the pictures to the foreign market, with the other he formed a list of private British collectors. Having obtained what he considered the highest possible bids from across the seas, he submitted pictures and bids to the private British collectors, and invited them, of their public spirit, to outbid. In three instances (including the Goya) out of twenty-one he was successful. And why? One of the private collectors made buttons--he had made so many that he desired that his wife should be called Lady [...] "Buttons." [...] He therefore bought a unique picture at great cost, and gave it to the nation. It was [...] "part," [...] his friends said, [...] "of his general game." [...] The second of the private collectors was an Americophobe, and bought an unique picture to [...] "spite the damned Yanks." [...] The third of the private collectors was Soames, who--more sober than either of the, others--bought after a visit to Madrid, because he was certain that Goya was still on the up grade. Goya was not booming at the moment, but he would come again; and, looking at that portrait, Hogarthian, Manetesque in its directness, but with its own queer sharp beauty of paint, he was perfectly satisfied still that he had made no error, heavy though the price had been--heaviest he had ever paid. And next to it was hanging the copy of [...] "La Vendimia." [...] There she was--the little wretch--looking back at him in her dreamy mood, the mood he loved best because he felt so much safer when she looked like that.|$|E

5000|$|By contrast, the American scholar Rachel Brownstein {{argued that}} Elizabeth rejects two offers of {{marriage}} {{by the time}} she arrives at Pemberley, and notes in rejecting Mr. Collins that the narrator of the novel paraphrases the feminist Mary Wollstonecraft that Elizabeth cannot love him because she is [...] "a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart".

Brownstein further states that Austen <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>both</b> <b>ways</b> in depicting Elizabeth as she uses much irony.

This lecture analyzes examples found in technical and in non-technical contexts. One can say “Abe knows whether Ben draws” {{in two other}} ways: ‘Abe knows whether or not Ben draws’ or ‘Abe knows whether Ben draws or not’. But a stylistic TME occurs in ‘Abe knows whether or not Ben draws or not’. One can say “Abe knows how Ben looks” using ‘Abe knows what Ben looks like’. But syntactical TMEs are in ‘Abe knows what Ben looks’ and in ‘Abe knows how Ben looks like’. One can deny that Abe knows Ben by prefixing ‘It isn’t that’ or by interpolating ‘doesn’t’. But a pragmatic TME occurs in trying to deny that Abe knows Ben by using ‘It isn’t that Abe doesn’t know Ben’. There are several standard ways of defining truth using sequences. Quine’s discussions in the 1970 first printing of Philosophy of logic [3] and in previous lectures were vitiated by mixing two [1, p. 98]. The logical TME in [3], which eluded Quine’s colleagues, was corrected in the 1978 sixth printing [2]. But Quine never explicitly acknowledged, described, or even mentioned the error.

40|$|Recently, Pepperdine University Libraries {{initiated}} the digitization and curatorial arrangement {{of a large}} collection of negatives and prints donated by the widow of Hanson A. Williams, Jr., one of our alumni. Williams had been a photographer by trade and, after his death, his wife donated 13. 86 linear feet of photographic images depicting his life at college and immediately afterwards in the Korean War. After processing the collection, {{we realized that we}} had a copious number of Williams’ original negatives in addition to multiple iterations (in some cases) of prints that he had made from these negatives. As we discussed a digitization plan for scanning these images for both digital preservation and access, we realized we had to answer a critical question: Should we use the negative of an image as the scanning source or one of its corresponding prints? The answer is not so straightforward, as each scenario presents its advantages and disadvantages. Scanning from the negative provides greater sharpness and zoom quality, as well as more visual information (portions of a negative image are typically cropped out of printed photographs). Scanning from a print, however, provides a representation of the photographer’s vision, cropped to his or her liking, and—more importantly—developed to certain levels of contrast, tone, saturation, etc. Scanning from the negative, therefore, values the image for its informational and documentary qualities, while scanning from the print emphasizes the artistry and commentary of the photographer. The question quickly becomes philosophical: what is the image in photography collections and why? The answers may depend on the purpose and spirit of the collection: is it a documentary collection about the visual record produced by a body of work or is it a biographical collection about the creator of that work? <b>Having</b> <b>it</b> <b>both</b> <b>ways</b> can be challenging as both the staffing resources required for scanning and the long-term maintenance of the resulting files come with a price tag.
