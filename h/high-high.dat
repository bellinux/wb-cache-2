40|$|Organizational {{commitment}} {{has been}} linked to different culture types in previous research. It is also well known that higher commitment levels equate to increased retention rates, engaged employees, and profits. The need for this research is because there is very little research on the culture of manufacturing organizations in association with commitment. Therefore, this research disseminated surveys to two manufacturing organizations. The surveys measured organizational culture types (adhocracy, clan, market, and hierarchy) through the use of the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument (OCAI) and organizational commitment through the use of the Organizational Commitment Questionnaire (OCQ). The results confirmed some of the general beliefs about culture types—adhocracy cultures have more positive influence on commitment than the other culture types. However, there were also some varying findings—market culture had the second strongest influence on commitment. These findings will bring forth future research recommendations in order to determine exactly what aspects of adhocracy and market cultures affect commitment. The rewards are <b>high—higher</b> commitment equates to more profit and higher stocks. This research benefits managers and executives in the manufacturing industry. ...|$|R
40|$|This project {{investigated}} a miniature, hourglass-shaped actuator (MHA) and how its geometry affects performance. A custom, self-contained, finite-element simulation code predicts {{how each}} MHA deforms when pressurized internally. This analysis describes the MHA geometry's effects on four characteristics: a) work density b) mechanical advantage, c) work advantage and d) percent elongation. The first three characteristics are {{compared to a}} traditional actuator operating {{at the same pressure}} and elongation. A finite-element modeling code was tailored to study the MHA at 5 MPa internal pressure when 1) MHA height and side-wall thickness are constant and side-wall arc length varies; 2) MHA side-wall arc length and thickness are constant and the height varies; and 3) MHA side-wall thickness varies while height and side-wall arc length are fixed. Case 3 was studied using the MHA geometry with the highest work density found in either condition 1 or 2. Peak mechanical advantage, 6. 47, occurs in a constant height MHA-Case 1 -when the side-wall arc length is shortest. Highest elongation, 8. 67 %, occurs in the Case 1 MHA with the longest side-wall arc length. Finally, under Case 3, work density reaches 0. 434 MJ/m 3 when the side-wall thickness is 1. 9 mm. The MHA has potential for active structures because its work density is <b>high-higher</b> than traditional actuators with the same elongation. Their small elongations limit their use; however, much work remains to determine how MHAs might be arranged in a useful array. Never the less, morphing airfoils and other active structures might benefit from embedded MHAs...|$|R

Organic matter averaged 4. 8 percent; bulk density averaged 1. 3 g/cm 3; and pH averaged 7. 1, which are indicative of mineral soils. Results of the 3 -Mehlick Separation Technique and ICP mineral analysis averaged: aluminum 655 μg-Al/g, boron 1. 6 μg-B/g, calcium 3042 μg-Ca/g, copper 4. 8 μg-Cu/g, iron 492 μg-Fe/g, magnesium 483 μg-Mg/g, manganese 193 μg-Mn/g, nitrate-nitrogen 4. 1 μg-NO 3 /g, phosphorus 13. 2 μg-P/g, potassium 92 μg-K/g, sodium 166 μg-Na/g, sulfur 143 μg-S/g, and zinc 3. 7 μg-Zn/g. The highest concentrations of soil nitrate, iron, and sodium were detected at the Billabong inflow, while the highest concentrations of soil potassium, magnesium and boron were detected in an emergent Typha zone. Spatial {{distribution of}} soil phosphorus was consistent with the expectation that higher concentrations (18. 6 - 21. 9 μg-P/g) would be found in (captured by) the dense emergent Typha zone at the north end of the Billabong near the inflow and that lower concentrations (3. 2 - 6. 4 μg-P/g) would be found in the deep open water zone in the south part of the Billabong.

This study investigated whether familiarity and proficiency factors {{play a role}} in EFL learners’ use of interactional resources (i. e., turn-taking, topic management, repair and task management) and the emergence of interactional patterns (i. e., collaborative, parallel, asymmetric and blend) in paired speaking tests. The study was carried out with 100 EFL learners paired as low-low, <b>high-high</b> and low-high and with 36 EFL learners matched as unfamiliar and familiar in the oral proficiency exam at a state university in Turkey. In order to place the participants for low-low, <b>high-high</b> and low-high groups, their scores in the proficiency exam which measured their reading, writing and listening skills as well as their vocabulary and grammar knowledge, and their scores in the oral proficiency exam were examined by the researcher. While 15 pairs were selected for the low-low and <b>high-high</b> groups separately, 20 pairs were selected for the low-high group. Then all 100 students (50 pairs) in the first cohort were asked whether their partners were their classmates or their friends in the exam and nine pairs out of 50 were detected as familiar. After that, nine unfamiliar pairs were selected in order to compare them with the familiar ones. In total, 50 videos were listened to and transcribed by using the conventions suggested by Jefferson (2004). Forthwith, all transcriptions were analyzed in order to identify the interactional resources such as turn-taking, repair, topic management and task management employed by the test-takers during the test discourse. Following this process, the researcher drew upon the interactional resources in order to assign the interactional patterns such as collaborative, asymmetric, parallel and blend which took place during test-takers’ interaction with each other. The results indicated that pairing two different proficiency level students is disadvantageous for the high level test-takers in terms of topic management, task management and repair. In contrast, while the low levels are advantageous in terms of topic and task management in particular, they are disadvantageous in terms of turn-taking. What is more, while <b>high-high</b> pairs create a collaborative pattern which is the most favorable one, low-low pairs usually create a parallel pattern. On the other hand, low-high pairs usually generate an asymmetric pattern due to the dominance of the high levels. Furthermore, the findings suggested that pairing two unfamiliar peer interlocutors seem more advantageous for the test-takers because unfamiliar pairs usually generate a collaborative pattern whereas familiar pairs usually create an asymmetric pattern during the test discourse. In light of these findings, this study provided insights into how test-takers should be matched in paired speaking tests for the test administrators. by Esma Lot. M. S...|$|E

It should be noted that in some combinations, the intimacy level of the initial disclosure was reciprocated while in others, the respondent did not reciprocate the intimacy level of the initial disclosure. The stimulus materials for these videotapes were derived from 2 pilot studies. Following the viewing of the videotapes, subjects were requested to; (A) recall the exchange; (B) judge the respondent on the likability and friendship scales; (C) give explanations for their judgements. The results implied that the sixth grade children provided evidence for the norm of reciprocity pattern by indicating more liking and greater desirability for friendship with the <b>High-High,</b> Low-Low stimulus person combinations in which. the respondent reciprocated the intimacy level of the initial disclosure. The explanations of judgements given by the sixth grade children also provided some support for the norm of reciprocity pattern. In contrast, the results indicated that the kindergarten children based their liking and friendship judgements on the content of communication...|$|E
40|$|We {{prove that}} the Korteweg-de Vries initial-value problem is {{globally}} well-posed in H − 3 / 4 (R) and the modified Korteweg-de Vries initial-value problem is globally well-posed in H 1 / 4 (R). The new ingredient is that we use directly the contraction principle to prove local well-posedness for KdV equation in H − 3 / 4 by constructing some special resolution spaces {{in order to avoid}} some ’logarithmic divergence ’ from the <b>high-high</b> interactions. Our local solution has almost the same properties as those for H s (s> − 3 / 4) solution which enable us to apply the I-method to extend it to a global solution...|$|E
