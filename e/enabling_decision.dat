How these messages are conveyed to the target audience, {{plays a key role}} tailored to the target audience to trigger deep or shallow processing, from using the best path to persuasion. The target audience analysis process requires a tremendous amount of work, to identify the characteristics of the broad target audience, refining this audience on several dimensions. The specific conformity of the target audience to the desired supporting psychological operations objective is the product of assiduous work, mainly of the target audience analysis phase of influence process, this validates the importance of this role to the overall operation <b>enabling</b> <b>decision</b> makers, to gain substantial objectives in the information environment (Topolniski, 2013).|$|E

40|$|In this article, we {{demonstrate}} that individuals use motivated reasoning to convince themselves that their self-serving behavior is justified, {{which in turn}} affects the distribution of resources in business situations. Specifically, we explore how ambiguous contextual cues and individual beliefs can jointly form motivated reasoning. Across two experimental studies, we find that whereas individual ideologies that endorse status hierarchies (i. e., social dominance orientation) can strengthen the relationship between contextual ambiguity and motivated reasoning, individual beliefs rooted in fairness and equality (i. e., moral identity) can weaken it. Our findings contribute to person–situation theories of business ethics and provide evidence that two ubiquitous factors in business organizations—contextual ambiguity and social dominance orientation—give rise to motivated reasoning, <b>enabling</b> <b>decision</b> makers to engage in self-serving distributions of resources...|$|E
40|$|Summary]: Correctly {{determining}} witness {{credibility is}} integral to a fair trial. Assessments of credibility by the triers of fact are made, inter alia, by reference to behavioural stereotypes that are commonly thought {{to be associated with}} lying and truth telling. These stereotypes are worthless but pervasive. In this study, venire jurors were given information such as would be given by way of judicial direction and/or expert testimony on those behavioural indicia that are useful in detecting deception. Major changes in venire juror perceptions of what does and does not work were found. This has significant implications for the conduct of criminal trials. Recommendations are presented which, it is argued, can be of real, practical assistance in <b>enabling</b> <b>decision</b> makers to assess the credibility of witnesses. ...|$|E

The {{continuing}} rapid {{developments in}} information and sensor technology, supporting Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C 4 ISR) systems, lead by commercial {{industry in the}} form of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products, have the potential to provide modern armies with considerable advantage [1] in terms of improved Situational Awareness (SA) and <b>enabling</b> <b>decision</b> superiority. However, as these products are low cost and unprotected, the C 4 ISR systems are vulnerable and susceptible to Electronic Attack (EA). EA can deny, degrade, deceive and delay the information required by the commander, necessary to enable decision superiority.

40|$|Abstract. Energy {{efficiency}} {{is regarded as}} an important objective {{in a world of}} limited resources. The sustainable use of energy is necessary for the continuity of life styles that do not jeopardize the future. Nevertheless, due to poor information about the impact of human actions on the environment, it is hard to promote and warn for sustainability. This work focuses on the use of ambient intelligence as a mean to constantly revise sustainability indicators in a way they may be used for user awareness and recommendation systems within communities. The approach in this research makes use of sustainable indicators monitored through ambient sensors which enable user accountability concerning their actions inside each environment. Also, it is possible to compare the effect of user actions in the environment, <b>enabling</b> <b>decision</b> making based on such comparison factors...|$|E
