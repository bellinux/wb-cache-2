In the late 1970s the city considered renovating the building, possibly to use as a concert hall for organ recitals, or as a general cultural administration centre.

5|$|Risley's survey {{task was}} aided when {{research}} papers of a recently deceased Indian Medical Service doctor, James Wise, {{were given to}} him by the doctor's widow. Wise had researched the people of Eastern Bengal and it was agreed that, after ascertaining the accuracy of his work, his research should be incorporated into Risley's survey results. In return, those volumes of the survey dealing with ethnographic matters would be dedicated to Wise. Further assistance came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> of Edward Tuite Dalton into the jungle tribes of Chhotanagpur and Assam. Dalton, like Wise, had previously published his efforts but now they would be integrated {{as a part of a}} larger whole. Risley was able to deal with the remaining areas of Bengal by making use of a large staff of correspondents who came from disparate backgrounds, such as missionaries, native people and Government officials.|$|E
5|$|Word that Lewis was {{developing}} his own {{solutions to the}} minimum range problem reached the AI team at St Athan some time in early 1940. Bowen was extremely upset. He had become used {{to the way the}} researchers had been put into an ill-advised attempt at production but now Rowe was directly removing them <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> effort as well. Tizard heard of the complaints and visited Dundee in an attempt to smooth them over, which evidently failed. On 29 March 1940 a memo from Watt's DCD office announced a reorganization of the Airborne Group. Gerald Touch would move to the RAE to help develop production, installation and maintenance procedures for the Mk. IV, several other members would disperse to RAF airfields to help train the ground and air crews directly on the units, {{while the rest of the}} team, including Lovell and Hodgkin, would re-join the main radar research teams in Dundee. Bowen was notably left out of the reorganization; his involvement in AI ended. In late July, Bowen was invited to join the Tizard Mission, which left for the US in August 1940.|$|E

This characteristic immobility could be counteracted by the pre-administration of prazosin.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{emotional}} approach coping may {{signal to the}} social environment that an individual {{is in need of}} support. The responsiveness of the social environment will determine the adaptiveness {{of emotional}} approach coping. Emotional expression that is met with empathetic concern may lead to better adjustment than emotional expression met by rejection. Some evidence <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> suggests this could be a potential mechanism. For women with breast cancer who perceive their social environment to be highly receptive, coping through emotional expression predicts improved quality of life.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} widely {{acknowledged}} that uncertainty in sensory domains results in an increased dependence of multisensory integration. Hence, it follows that cues from multiple modalities that are both temporally and spatially synchronous are viewed neurally and perceptually as emanating from the same source. The degree of synchrony that is required for this 'binding' to occur is currently being investigated {{in a variety of}} approaches. It should be noted here that the integrative function only occurs to a point beyond which the subject can differentiate them as two opposing stimuli. Concurrently, a significant intermediate conclusion can be drawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> thus far. Multisensory stimuli that are bound into a single percept, are also bound on the same receptive fields of multisensory neurons in the SC and cortex.|$|E
25|$|Follower-focused {{approaches}} look at {{the processes}} by which leaders motivate followers, and lead teams to achieve shared goals. Understandably, the area of leadership motivation draws heavily from the abundant research literature {{in the domain of}} motivation in I/O psychology. Because leaders are held responsible for their followers' ability to achieve the organization's goals, their ability to motivate their followers is a critical factor of leadership effectiveness. Similarly, the area of team leadership draws heavily <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> in teams and team effectiveness in I/O psychology. Because organizational employees are frequently structured in the form of teams, leaders {{need to be aware of}} the potential benefits and pitfalls of working in teams, how teams develop, how to satisfy team members' needs, and ultimately how to bring about team effectiveness and performance.|$|E
25|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> {{that has}} been {{conducted}} on TCKs, {{it has been found}} that subjects are generally more tolerant of different cultures and of people of different backgrounds than subjects from the same home country who are not TCKs. In addition, TCKs generally feel that they are better able to adapt to new cultures and understand how to behave appropriately in these new environments. Researcher and teacher Wenda Sheard surveyed some of her multi-cultural students, most of whom were either fluent in two or more languages, and found that many felt that they had an increased tolerance of other cultures. However, as one student explained, part of this tolerance was out of necessity for maintaining a healthy social life in one's new environment and culture.|$|E
