5|$|By 1914 Olivia {{seems to}} have {{realised}} that Dorothy was determined to marry Pound, and finally consented; ironically Pound was then earning less than he had in 1911. Hope Shakespear relented when the couple agreed to a church wedding rather than a civil ceremony, which took place on 20April 1914. Olivia gave them two early circus <b>drawings</b> <b>by</b> Pablo Picasso.|$|E

5|$|Director Rob Bowman {{initially}} {{thought that}} the episode could be filmed in five days, two fewer than usual. However, it was actually filmed in three days after pressure from Paramount with two spent only on the sickbay set. He later said that he simply shot the framework for the clips to be added in later, and never saw a final cut of the episode. Production assistant Eric A. Stillwell was responsible for selecting the clips {{that went into the}} episode, with 21 different clips included. The prop used on Riker to fight the infection was created from <b>drawings</b> <b>by</b> designer Rick Sternbach.|$|E
5|$|Howard and {{her husband}} were part of a circle of artists, writers and {{designers}} who were interested in visual images, in language and in the book arts. One close associate was the graphic designer Allan Fleming, whose Martlet Press published Twenty-Eight <b>Drawings</b> <b>by</b> Barbara Howard in 1970, a period when she was drawing the figure. The Canadian wood engraver Rosemary Kilbourn, a close friend since art college, taught Howard to carve images that could be printed in conjunction with text.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most {{previous}} BS stations, {{a separate}} station building was not constructed at Paddington. A small pedestrian entrance on the north-west {{corner of the}} junction of London Street and Praed Street provides access to the below-ground ticket hall. Following their successful introduction at Earl's Court in 1911, the station was the first {{on the line to}} be designed to use escalators instead of lifts. The ticket hall and platforms are decorated with tiling designs by David Hamilton installed during a £6 million refurbishment of the station between 1984 and 1987 incorporating elements of technical <b>drawings</b> <b>by</b> Marc Isambard Brunel and other engineers.|$|E
5|$|A large mound on {{the south}} side of the plaza was once the Temple of Jakawitz, a deity of the {{mountains}} and the patron of the Ajaw K'iche' lineage. Like the other structures of Q'umarkaj, all the stone facing has been robbed, leaving only a rubble and mud core. This structure was part of a complex that consisted of a patio enclosed by the temple on the northern side, a palace {{on the south}}ern side and a long building on the east. The Jakawitz complex has not been investigated archaeologically. <b>Drawings</b> <b>by</b> Rivera y Maestre suggest that the temple was a narrow building with four or five terraces.|$|E
5|$|Between 1982 and 1988 {{a series}} based on Irish {{architecture}} {{through the ages}} was released, with line <b>drawings</b> <b>by</b> Michael Craig and graphics by Peter Wildbur. It contained twenty-eight stamps, with values ranging from 1p to £5. Stamps based on Irish cultural heritage followed between 1990 and 1995. Irish birds feature in the 1997 series that span the conversion of currency from the Irish pound, through dual currency {{to the introduction of}} the Euro. These were the first definitives where all values were printed in full colour. On 9 September 2004 new stamps, featuring flowers native to the woodlands and hedgerows of Ireland, become available. These were replaced in September 2010 by a seventh series featuring animals and marine life using photographic images.|$|E

5|$|Both monthly {{and daily}} Yotsuba&! {{calendars}} {{have been released}} every year since 2005, although a monthly calendar for 2009 was not released due to constraints on Azuma's schedule. The 2005 edition of the monthly calendar featured pictures of Yotsuba playing with animals such as lions, zebras, and kangaroos. The 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2010 editions feature photographs altered to include Yotsuba doing such things as playing with other children or reaching for a balloon. The photographs were by Miho Kakuta, with <b>drawings</b> <b>by</b> Kiyohiko Azuma. The daily calendars have a mix of original and manga artwork, with occasional captions, {{as well as other}} fun items – for example, the 2006 calendar had a game of shiritori ongoing through the year. The daily calendars run from April to March, following the Japanese school year instead of the calendar year.|$|E
5|$|Despite this protest, {{two sets}} of {{illustrations}} for Candide were produced by the French artist Jean-Michel Moreau le Jeune. The first version was done, at Moreau's own expense, in 1787 and included in Kehl's publication of that year, Oeuvres Complètes de Voltaire. Four images were drawn by Moreau for this edition and were engraved by Pierre-Charles Baquoy. The second version, in 1803, consisted of seven <b>drawings</b> <b>by</b> Moreau which were transposed by multiple engravers. The twentieth-century modern artist Paul Klee stated that it was while reading Candide that he discovered his own artistic style. Klee illustrated the work, and his drawings were published in a 1920 version edited by Kurt Wolff.|$|E
5|$|The Royal College of Music {{commissioned}} {{an official}} {{portrait of the}} composer from Sir Gerald Kelly (1952) which hangs in the college. The Manchester Art Gallery has a bronze sculpture of Vaughan Williams by Epstein (1952) and the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) has <b>drawings</b> <b>by</b> Joyce Finzi (1947) and Juliet Pannett (1957 and 1958); versions of a bronze head of the composer by David McFall (1956) are in the NPG and {{at the entrance to}} the Music reading room of the British Library. There is a statue of Vaughan Williams in Dorking, and a bust in Chelsea Embankment Gardens, near his old house in Cheyne Walk.|$|E

5|$|The book {{contains}} an evenly distributed mixture of natural history, travel, and observation of human societies, including the towns with their Catholic processions. Only {{the most remarkable}} discoveries of animals and plants are described, and theories such as evolution and mimicry are barely mentioned. Bates remarks that finding a new species is only the start; he also describes animal behaviour, sometimes in detail, as for the army ants. He constantly relates the wildlife to the people, explaining how the people hunt, what they eat and what they use as medicines. The book is illustrated with <b>drawings</b> <b>by</b> leading artists including E. W. Robinson, Josiah Wood Whymper, Joseph Wolf and Johann Baptist Zwecker.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum has}} a {{collection}} of 13,000 artifacts, books, photographs, art objects, and memorabilia. The DuSable collection has come largely from private gifts. It has United States slavery-era relics, nineteenth- and twentieth-century artifacts, and archival materials, including the diaries of sea explorer Captain Harry Dean. The DuSable collection includes works from scholar W. E. B. Du Bois, sociologist St. Clair Drake, and poet Langston Hughes. The African American art collection contains selections from the South Side Community Art Center students Charles White, Archibald Motley, Jr., Gus Nall, Charles Sebree, and Marion Perkins, as well as numerous New Deal Works Progress Administration period and 1960s Black Arts Movement works. The museum also owns prints and <b>drawings</b> <b>by</b> Henry O. Tanner, Richmond Barthé, and Romare Bearden, and has an extensive collection of books and records pertaining to African and African American history and culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{palace of}} Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, south east of Paris, was another of Catherine's {{unfinished}} projects. She bought this building, on which Philibert de l'Orme had worked, from the heirs of Cardinal Jean du Bellay, after the latter's death in 1560. She then commissioned de l'Orme {{to finish the}} work he had begun there. <b>Drawings</b> <b>by</b> Jacques Androuet du Cerceau in the British Museum may shed light on Catherine's intentions for Saint-Maur. They show a plan to enlarge each wing by doubling {{the size of the}} pavilions next to the main block of the house. The house was to stay as one storey, with a flat roof and rusticated pilasters. That meant the extensions would not unbalance the masses of the building as seen from the side.|$|E

5|$|Wolf: The Journey Home, {{originally}} titled Hungry for Home: A Wolf Odyssey, is a 1997 American {{young adult}} novel written by 'Asta Bowen. Originally published by Simon & Schuster with line <b>drawings</b> <b>by</b> Jane Hart Meyer, it was retitled and reprinted without illustrations in 2006 by Bloomsbury Publishing. Based on true {{accounts of the}} Pleasant Valley, Montana, wolf pack, the novel traces {{the life of a}} female alpha wolf named Marta after the forced relocation of her pack in 1989 to an unfamiliar territory. Terrified, Marta abandons her pack and begins a journey in search of her home; she eventually arrives in Ninemile Valley, where she finds a new mate with whom she starts a new pack.|$|E
5|$|Monument Valley is an indie puzzle game {{developed}} {{and published by}} Ustwo Games. The player leads the princess Ida through mazes of optical illusions and impossible objects while manipulating the world around her to reach various platforms. Monument Valley was developed over ten months beginning in early 2013 based on concept <b>drawings</b> <b>by</b> company artist Ken Wong. Its visual style was inspired by Japanese prints, minimalist sculpture, and indie games Windosill, Fez, and , and was compared by critics to M. C. Escher drawings and Echochrome. The art was designed such that each frame would be worthy of public display. After a closed beta test, it was released for iOS on April 3, 2014, and was later ported to Android and Windows Phone. The game received generally favorable reviews. Critics praised its art and sound design, but noted its lack of difficulty and short length. It won a 2014 Apple Design Award, was named Apple's best iPad game of 2014, and sold over two million copies by January 2015; by May 2016, sales of the game exceeded 26 million.|$|E
5|$|Tesla read many works, memorizing {{complete}} books, {{and supposedly}} possessed a photographic memory. He was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin. Tesla related {{in his autobiography}} that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions. Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they would provide the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing {{the name of an}} item, {{he would be able to}} envision it in realistic detail. Tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. He typically did not make <b>drawings</b> <b>by</b> hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.|$|E
