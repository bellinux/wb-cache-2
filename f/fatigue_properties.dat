The surface integrity and <b>fatigue</b> <b>property</b> of a high speed milled Ti- 6. 5 Al- 2 Zr- 1 Mo- 1 V (TA 15) titanium alloy were investigated in this research. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to study the influence of milling speed on the surface integraty and <b>fatigue</b> <b>property</b> of the machined part. The surface roughness, work hardening, metallurgical structure and residual stress of the machined surface were studied in a cutting speed range of from 50 m/min to 300 m/min. To verify the relationship between cutting speed and the surface integrity of machined surface, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>property</b> of titanium alloy specimens milled at four different cutting speeds ranging from 50 to 200 m/min were compared at two stress levels. This research shows that the cutting speed has little effect on the work hardening, metallurgical structure and residual stress, but the surface roughness decreases with the increasing cutting speed.
