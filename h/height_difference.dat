Compared to its predecessor, CryoSat-2 features software upgrades, greater battery capacity and an updated instrument package. Its main instrument is an interferometric radar range-finder with twin antennas, which measures the <b>height</b> <b>difference</b> between the upper surface of floating ice and surrounding water. This is often known as 'free-board'.|$|E
5|$|The player {{may choose}} one of two courses: the Royal Troon Golf Club and the Old Course at St. Andrews. The player's caddie {{provides}} information about the pitfalls and idiosyncrasies of each course. The game simulates the strong wind and weather typical of the courses' real-world counterparts, which lie near the seaside. The player may adjust environmental aspects such as weather, wind speed and the wetness of the soil. During a match, the player uses information on the heads-up display to determine such factors as wind speed and direction, the ball's distance from the flag and the <b>height</b> <b>difference</b> between the ball and the hole.|$|E

25|$|The stadium has an {{asymmetrical}} appearance {{from the}} air and from some angles from ground level, due to the discrepancy in height between the sides and ends of the ground. The <b>height</b> <b>difference</b> between the Leazes/Milburn complex and the East/Gallowgate stands allows views of the city centre from many seating positions inside the ground.

30|$|In {{order to}} start the {{iterative}} optimisation loop (step 1 in Fig. 5), an initial mass model and the geoid <b>height</b> <b>differences</b> have to be calculated. This is the initial SEGM constructed in Section 2. However, if no prior information is available, the iteration could start with a “zero” mass model, thus the initial geoid <b>height</b> <b>differences</b> are identical to the EGM-induced geoid heights. In step 1, all mass elements are adjusted based on the sign and magnitude of the co-located geoid <b>height</b> <b>differences.</b> This means masses are added/removed where the SEGM-induced geoid heights are too small/large compared to EGM 2008.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ellipsoidal <b>height</b> <b>differences</b> have b•en {{determined}} for 13 station pairs in {{the central}} Ohio region using measurements made with the Global Positioning System. This in-formation was used to compute geoid undulation differences based on known orthometric <b>heights.</b> These <b>differences</b> were compared to gravimet-rically computed undulations (using a Stokes integration procedure and least squares col-location having an internal r. m. s. agreement of ñ 1 cm in undulation differences). The two sets of undulation differences have an r. m. s. discrepancy of ñ 5 cm while the average station separation is {{of the order of}} 14 km. This good agreement suggests that gravimetric data can be used to compute accurate geoid undulation differences {{that can be used to}} convert ellip-soidal <b>height</b> <b>differences</b> obtained from GPS to orthometric <b>height</b> <b>differences...</b>|$|R
40|$|A linear {{empirical}} {{model has been}} developed for the correction of sea state bias effects, in Seasat altimetry data altitude measurements, that are due to (1) electromagnetic bias caused {{by the fact that}} ocean wave troughs reflect the altimeter signal more strongly than the crests, shifting the apparent mean sea level toward the wave troughs, and (2) an independent instrument-related bias resulting from the inability of height corrections applied in the ground processor to compensate for simplifying assumptions made for the processor aboard Seasat. After applying appropriate corrections to the altimetry data, an {{empirical model}} for the sea state bias is obtained by <b>differencing</b> significant wave <b>height</b> and height measurements from coincident ground tracks. <b>Height</b> <b>differences</b> are minimized by solving for the coefficient of a linear relationship between <b>height</b> <b>differences</b> and wave <b>height</b> <b>differences</b> that minimize the <b>height</b> <b>differences.</b> In more than 50 % of the 36 cases examined, 7 % of the value of significant wave height should be subtracted for sea state bias correction...|$|R
25|$|Between these low {{ranges of}} hills the Ancholme river runs south to north through its flat, lowlying flood plain, with a northsouth <b>height</b> <b>difference</b> {{of only a}} few metres. The town sits on {{alluvial}} soils of the Ancholme, and the area surrounding the town was previously a semiflooded marsh known as carrs. A series of drainage improvements from the 1630s to the 1820s transformed the whole of the valley into arable land. The largest of the drainage channels is also a canal known as the New River Ancholme. The original course of the river has been obliterated in places by the drainage works, but its discontinuous surviving length is known as the Old River Ancholme.|$|E
25|$|Compared to filters {{that hang}} {{on the back of}} the aquarium, canister-style {{external}} filters offer a greater quantity of filter materials to be used along with a greater degree of flexibility with respect to filter material choice. Water enters the canister filled with the chosen filter material through an intake pipe at the bottom of the canister, passes through the material, and is fed back to the aquarium through the return pipe. Water is forced to circulate through the filter by a pump typically installed at the top of the canister. It is important to note that canister filters are sealed, fully flooded systems, meaning that the aquarium, intake pipe, filter interior and the return pipe form a continuous body of water. In this configuration both the intake and return path form two siphons, which precisely counterbalance each other. Under these circumstances, the filter pump does not have to spend any effort to lift the water back to the aquarium, regardless of how high the latter is installed above the canister. The pump should only be powerful enough to push the water through the filtering material as well as overcome the drag in the intake and return pipes. This makes canister filter pumps virtually insensitive to the <b>height</b> <b>difference</b> between the aquarium and the filter (although exceeding the manufacturer-specified height limit can lead to leaks).|$|E

500|$|There is no {{wheelchair}} {{access to}} the southbound platform; the ramp to the northbound platform is steeper than 1 in 12, making it unsuitable for wheelchair users, {{and there is a}} large <b>height</b> <b>difference</b> from the train doors to the platform. In 2011 the government announced a £37.5 million scheme to improve stations under an [...] "Access For All Mid-Tier programme", of which £1,023,000 was to go towards building new ramps at Nailsea and Backwell. The works were due to start in 2013, but were delayed until 2014 due to a need to repair subsidence on the embankment and wait for works on the car park to be completed. However, due to the delays the funding was withdrawn. Further funding was secured in 2015, but plans for ramps were shelved entirely in 2016 due to fears of further subsidence.

500|$|Cassidy {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Bela Talbot, but ultimately received the part of Ruby. As opposed to using traditional demonic abilities such as telekinesis, Ruby instead relies on conventional martial arts and her demon-killing knife. Cassidy trained in kickboxing alongside Bela's actress Lauren Cohan to be able to perform Ruby's martial arts skills, prompting her to attempt as many of the fight scenes as she could rather than rely on her stunt double. Before filming for the third season began, she and Cohan decided to watch previous seasons together to catch up on the show. Cassidy also prepared by looking to Sharon Stone's performance in the film Basic Instinct for inspiration due to Ruby's manipulative ways. As Cassidy explained, [...] " [...] always has the power, and there's this mystery about her." [...] Costume designer Diane Widas had Ruby dressed in dark colors so that she would blend into shadows, also giving her pleather jackets and narrow jeans to allow Cassidy to be more active. Because of Cassidy's <b>height</b> <b>difference</b> with the lead actors—she is 5'7" [...] while Sam's actor, Jared Padalecki, is 6'4"—she had to wear tall, spiky high heels that at times made her lose balance.|$|E
