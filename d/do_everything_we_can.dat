2500|$|The word patriation {{was coined}} in Canada as a {{back-formation}} from repatriation (returning to one's country). Prior to 1982, the Canadian constitution was held by, and modified by, the United Kingdom (on {{request from the}} Parliament of Canada); hence some have felt that the term patriation was more suitable than the term repatriation (returning something). The term was first used in 1966 by Prime Minister Lester B.

[...] Regarding the different explanations afterward for what had happened, she said, [...] "In the wake of an attack like this, in the fog of war, there's always going to be confusion. And I think it is absolutely fair to say that everyone had the same intelligence. Everyone who spoke tried to give the information that they had. As time has gone on, that information has changed. We've gotten more detail, but that's not surprising. That always happens." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bernie Sanders opposes {{guest worker}} {{programs}} {{and is also}} skeptical about skilled immigrant (H-1B) visas, saying, [...] "Last year, the top 10 employers of H-1B guest workers were all offshore outsourcing companies.

[...] In an interview with Vox he stated his opposition to an open borders immigration policy, describing it as:...a right-wing proposal, which says essentially there is no United States...you're doing away {{with the concept of}} a nation-state. [...] What right-wing people in this country would love is an open-border policy. Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be great for them. I don’t believe in that.

2500|$|Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican {{associated}} with the Tea Party movement, questioned her repeatedly on a different aspect, whether Ambassador to the UN Rice had misled the public after the attacks.

Our first duty is towards British citizens caught up in this terror in Mumbai. The High Commissioner has come from Delhi to visit all those who are injured – he's visiting them now. It is too early to say any numbers for the numbers of people who are injured – we will give that {{during the course of the}} day – what I can assure you is we are doing everything within our power. We've set up a crisis centre in the foreign office where British citizens can phone in, just visit it and talk to them – they've had 800 calls already. And at the same time, we're in touch with many people who are caught up in the hotels and giving advice on what they can do. Our second responsibility is obviously to root out terrorism – to help the Indian government with their action – and that's why at the same time as giving support to the Indian prime minister, we're sending police emergency teams that are well versed in Indian terrorism and we will try to give what support we can through British police and security officials to the Indian government at this time".
