5000|$|<b>Infectious</b> <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> is {{a disease}} of large animals, {{especially}} sheep, caused by Clostridium novyi infection. The primary infection is intestinal and transferred by the faecal-oral route. Spores of C. novyi escape from the gut and lodge in the liver, where they remain dormant until some injury creates anaerobic conditions for them to germinate, causing local necrosis and widespread damage to the microvascular system, resulting in subcutaneous bleeding and blackening of the skin, hence the common name [...] "black disease." ...|$|E
40|$|Master of EducationThis thesis {{examines}} {{the life and}} veterinary contribution of Dr Harold E. Albiston. Through his professional life can be traced the history of veterinary science in Victoria, from the horse doctor days of pre World War I to the re-establishment of the University of Melbourne Veterinary School in September 1962. Special {{attention is paid to}} the late 1920 s which saw veterinary teaching cease at the end of 1927 and the University of Melbourne Veterinary School officially close in June 1928. Albiston, who was {{on the staff of the}} Veterinary School, witnessed this critical time in Victorian veterinary history. During the world-wide veterinary recession from 1920 to 1935, due to the declining influence of the horse, Albiston was one of the first veterinarians to appreciate that a new direction was necessary for the profession. While he was assistant-director, he upgraded the facilities of the Veterinary School, and encouraged research and diagnostic work on farm animals. As the day of the horse passed Albiston had built up the Veterinary School or the Veterinary Research Institute (VRI) as it became known in 1931, into an organisation of status serving the emerging livestock industries. The VRI was a unique establishment since it functioned as a normal university department, under the aegis of the University of Melbourne, yet performed diagnostic and research work for the Department of Agriculture. The VRI became an enlightened veterinary centre - a meeting place where veterinarians would visit, browse in the library and discuss problems with Harold Albiston or the VRI senior staff. It also became the centre of post graduate veterinary education in Victoria since all conferences, meetings and seminars were held there and for twenty-three years it was the home of the Australian Veterinary Journal (AVJ). The thesis also examines Albiston's research and diagnostic achievements before he was engulfed by administrative responsibilities. In 1927 he helped to solve black disease, or <b>infectious</b> <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> which was costing the sheep industry millions of pounds. He also played a major role in diagnosing and eradicating the first Newcastle disease outbreak in Australia in 1930. In 1933 he was credited with giving the first post-graduate veterinary course in Australia when he gave a series of poultry lectures at the VRI. So successful was this venture that he gave a similar course on cattle diseases the following year. Harold Albiston has been the longest serving member of the faculty of veterinary science, the longest serving editor of the AVJ and the longest serving member of both the Veterinary and Zoological Boards of Victoria. His contribution came from his humanity and a dogged determination, at board, faculty or committee level to make the most effective use of his talents - his warmth, his lack of pomposity, his consultative ability and his capacity for hard work. In 1959 Harold Albiston was awarded the Gilruth Prize for meritorious service to veterinary science. In 1963 he was awarded the honour of Commander of the British Empire.

40|$|Seven rabbits {{experimentally}} {{infected with}} rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus were examined haematologically and histologically. Haematologically, activated {{partial thromboplastin time}} and prothrombin time were markedly prolonged in the terminal phase of the disease, just prior to death (all the animals died between 27 and 40 hr after inoculation with rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus). There was an increase in the titre of fibrin degradation products and a decrease in antithrombin III activity during the same interval. Acute <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in many organs, including the lung, kidney, spleen and heart were the characteristic histopathological changes. Thus, the haematological and histological changes suggested that DIC was induced by rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus infection.

40|$|Eight European brown hares (Lepus europaeus) {{found dead}} {{throughout}} Greece were examined {{for the presence}} of European brown hare syndrome (EBHS). The diagnosis of the disease was established by macro- and microscopical lesions, and RT-PCR analysis. The most common lesions, such as <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> were observed in the liver, while congestion and haemorrhages were present mainly in lungs and tracheal mucosa. To determine the extent ofgenetic heterogeneity of the EBHSVisolates, a 265 bp fragment of the capsidprotein (VP 60) gene of the eight isolates were amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Greek isolates were indeedEBHS viruses and that EBHSVand RHDVdiffered by an average ofapproximately 39 %. The maximum nucleotide variation amongst all the EBHS viruses was 15 %, whereas variation within the RHDVgroup amountsto 11 %. Apart from GRE- 8, all the Greek viruses fell on a single geneticlineage and differed between 1 and 7 %; however, bootstrap confidence limits were particularly low on all the branches leading {{from the base of the}} EBHSVlineage to GRE- 8 (viz. 20, 13 and 9 %) isolates was better supported (65 %) ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the course}} of the novel, working in the {{hospital}} takes a psychological toll on Basch. His personality and outlook change, and he has outbursts of temper. He has adulterous trysts with various nurses (portrayed in great detail) and social service workers (nicknamed the [...] "Sociable Cervix") and his relationship with his girlfriend Berry suffers. A colleague, Wayne Potts, who had been constantly badgered by the upper hierarchy and haunted by a patient (nicknamed [...] "The Yellow Man" [...] for his fulminant <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> who goes comatose and eventually dies possibly because Potts had not put him on steroids), commits suicide. Basch becomes more callous and he secretly euthanizes a patient, a man called Saul the leukemic tailor, whose illness had gone into remission but was back in the hospital in incredible pain and begging for death. Basch becomes more and more emotionally unstable, until finally his friends force him to attend a mime performance by Marcel Marceau, where he has an experience of catharsis and recovers his emotional stability.|$|R
40|$|Homologous and {{heterologous}} haemagglutination-inhibition (HAI), complement-fixation (CF), immunodiffusion (ID) {{and mouse}} neutralization tests were {{performed with the}} Lunyo (LUN) and a Zimbabwean strain of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus, the prototype and a South African strain of Arumowot (AMT) virus and prototype strains of Gordil (GOR), Saint-Floris (SAF) and Gabek Forest (GF) viruses, using immune mouse ascitic fluids prepared against these viruses. Reactions of identity occurred in all tests between LUN and the Zimbabwean strains of RVF and between the two strains of AMT virus. Otherwise, cross-reactions occurred between all the phleboviruses in HAI tests, while reactions in CF, ID and neutralization tests were monospecific for virus serotypes, except that weak cross-reaction occurred between GOR and SAF viruses in CF and ID tests. Four sheep infected subcutaneously with the Zimbabwean strain of RVF virus developed transient fever, viraemia, leucopaenia, relative thrombocytopaenia, haemoconcentration and raised serum enzyme levels, which indicated that the sheep had developed <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> Disseminated focal <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> was confirmed in a sheep killed for examination on day 4 post-infection. The other three sheep recovered uneventfully after only mild depression and anorexia. Groups of three sheep infected with SAF, GOR, AMT and GF viruses had no demonstrable viraemia or other sign of infection or illness, except that the sheep infected with AMT developed mild fever lasting less than 24 h. Antibody responses were monitored at intervals {{over a period of}} 24 weeks in all sheep by homologous and heterologous HAI, CF and cell culture neutralization (CPENT) tests. Homologous antibody responses were marked in the RVF-infected sheep and their sera cross-reacted strongly in HAI tests with antigens of the other viruses. The sera of the RVF-infected sheep cross-reacted less markedly in CF and CPENT tests. Homologous antibody responses were poor in all the sheep infected with phleboviruses other than RVF, and the cross-reactivity of their sera for RVF antigen or virus was negligible. All sheep were challenged with RVF virus 48 weeks after their initial infection. The sheep which had originally been infected with RVF virus were immune and developed neither fever nor viraemia. All other sheep developed fever, viraemia and antibodies to RVF virus. It was concluded that the African phleboviruses, other than RVF, are unlikely to cause disease in livestock or to induce antibodies which could cause confusion in the diagnosis of RVF...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to report on a fatal case of feline toxoplasmosis with coinfection with the feline leukemia virus (FeLV). A domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus) presented intense dyspnea and died three days later. In the necropsy, the lungs were firm, without collapse and with many white areas; moderate lymphadenomegaly and splenomegaly were also observed. The histopathological examination showed severe necrotic interstitial bronchopneumonia and mild <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> associated with intralesional cysts and tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii that were positive by anti-T. gondii immunohistochemical (IHC) evaluation. The bone marrow showed chronic myeloid leukemia and the neoplastic cells were positive by anti-FeLV IHC evaluation. DNA extracted from lungs was positive for T. gondii by PCR targeting REP- 529. T. gondii was characterized by PCR-RFLP and by the microsatellites technique. ToxoDB-PCR-RFLP # 10, i. e. the archetypal type I, was identified. Microsatellite analysis showed that the strain was a variant of type I with two atypical alleles. This was the first time that a T. gondii clonal type I genotype was correlated with a case of acute toxoplasmosis in a host in Brazil...|$|R
40|$|An age-dependent {{increase}} in the resistance of BALB/c mice to induction of focal <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> by herpes simplex virus type 2 was demonstrated. In 3 -week-old mice inoculated intraperitoneally with virus, numerous necrotic foci developed in the liver. As the mice matured, the number of lesions declined {{until the age of}} 8 weeks, when no further {{increase in}} resistance appeared. Corresponding to this, the virus titers of livers and spleens of 3 -week-old mice were higher than in 8 -week-old animals throughout the infection, and the infection was apparently terminated in these organs of the adult mice by day 5. In vitro infection of peritoneal macrophages from 3 -week-old and 8 -week-old mice showed that this age-related resistance was concomitant with an increased restriction of virus replication in peritoneal macrophages from adult mice. Since, furthermore, the resistance of adult mice could be abolished by intravenous inoculation of the macrophage-toxic agent silica before infection, and since adoptive transfer of 2 X 10 (6) syngeneic macrophages from adult mice to young ones conferred to the latter a resistance comparable to that of the adult mice, it is concluded that macrophage maturation is responsible for the age-dependent resistance seen in this infection...|$|R
40|$|Congenitally athymic nude (nu/nu) mice of a BALB/c genetic {{background}} were found considerably {{more resistant to}} the induction of focal <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) tha, were phenotypically normal littermates (nu/+) or BALB/c mice. The augmented resistance was age dependent, as it was only manifested in mice from 4 to 5 weeks of age. Studies of the course of infection showed that nude mice were able to restrain virus multiplication in the liver far better than normal mice in the early phase of infection. However, they seemed inferior to normal mice in eliminating the infectious process. In vitro investigation of peritoneal macrophages revealed that macrophages from 6 -week-old nude mice exhibited accelerated spreading and were three times as restrictive in the replication of HSV- 2 as macrophages from normal mice. However, no difference {{was found in the}} efficiency of adsorption/phagocytosis between macrophages from nude and normal mice. The increased resistance of nude mice could be abolished by blockade of the microphage function of the mice by silica. Nude mice reconstituted at birth with thymus cells were just as susceptible to infection as normal mice. These data suggest that the increased resistance of nude mice to HSV- 2 hepatitis is due to the presence of nonspecifically activated macrophages before infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of {{herpes simplex}} virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 was compared after inoculation of mice by different routes. Intravaginal inoculation of HSV- 1 and HSV- 2 produced a local infection, with virus recovery from the vagina through 5 days. Virus was recovered from the spinal cords 4 to 5 days after inoculation but not from liver, kidney, lung, spleen, or blood. Intravenous or intraperitoneal inoculation of HSV- 2 produced a focal <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> similar to that described previously (S. C. Mogenson, B. Teisner, and H. K. Andersen, 1974). The viral etiology of the liver lesions was confirmed by virus isolation (through 4 days) and electron microscopy. No evidence of infection of the kidney, lung, blood, or spleen was observed, although virus was isolated from spinal cord homogenates 7 days after inoculation. HSV- 1 inoculation by the intraperitoneal or intravenous route resulted in virus isolation from the kidney during the 7 -day harvest period, without producing overt pathological changes. Virus was isolated from spinal cord homogenates 2 to 3 days after HSV- 1 inoculation but not from homogenates prepared from spleen, lung, or blood. Increases in serum transaminase activity were observed after systemic (intravenous) inoculation of HSV- 2 but not after HSV- 1 inoculation...|$|R
40|$|Rabbit {{haemorrhagic}} disease (RHD) {{is a highly}} infectious and fatal disease of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), responsible for important economic losses in the rabbit industry. The aetiological agent of the disease is a RNA virus (RHDV, Lagovirus, Caliciviridae) first detected in China in 1984. Currently RHDV is endemic {{in most parts of}} Europe, Asia and North Africa. Phylogenetic analyses of RHDV strains have identified 3 distinct groups : the classic RHDV, the variant RHDVa and RHDV 2. This latter has been detected in France {{for the first time in}} 2010 in domestic and wild rabbits (Le Gall-Reculé G et al., 2013) and since then has spread throughout Europe, replacing the circulating RHDV/RHDVa strains in most european countries. RHDV 2 has already been detected in Belgium in rabbitries (Marlier D et al., 2014). Here, we report for the first time the presence of RHDV 2 in wild rabbits in Southern Belgium. In november 2015, the Surveillance Network of Wildlife Diseases received seven dead wild rabbits for necropsy. The discovery of 7 fresh carcasses found at the same time in a same area (Hainaut province) emphasised the infectious or intoxication hypothesis as cause of death. Postmortem examinations were performed at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine (FVM) of the University of Liege according to a systematic protocol based on gross lesions, histopathological and targeted microbiological analysis. For necropsy, each rabbit (1) was weighted and age was determined by the presence/absence of the distal ulna protuberance, (2) stomach was investigated to exclude poison, (3) spleen was systematically driven into Yersinia CIN culture media for detection of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, (4) lungs and livers were systematically (a) packaged into 10 % formaldehyde solution for histopathology analysis (Service of Pathology, FVM) and (b) frozen at - 20 °C for RHDV analysis (Scanelis Laboratory,Toulouse, France) and finally (6) feces were gathered for parasitology (Service of Parasitology, FVM). At necropsy, animals (5 adults: 3 males/ 2 females and 2 juveniles: 1 male/ 1 female) were in good condition. No hematomas or broken bones were detected, only one displayed clues of diarrhoea. Examinations of the carcasses showed congestion of lungs/kidneys and livers were macroscopically normal. No foreign body or suspicious particles was seen in the stomachs, only one rabbit was hardly infested by tapeworms in the gut. Histopathological examination revealed haemorragic lung lesions in one animal while 5 of them presented severe <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> sometimes associated with peri-angiocholitis. Only one animal presented an abnormal high rate of coccidia in feces. Samples of livers were sent to Scanelis Laboratory for RHDV RT-qPCR diagnostic. The results were positive for the new variant RHDV 2 in 5 out of the 7 rabbit livers. All the samples were negative for the classic RHDV. To determine if RHDV 2 was already present before 2015 in wild rabbits in the region, we tested a series of livers that had been collected in 2013 and 2014 for a retrospective study. Among the 25 rabbit livers checked, 12 presented <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> and were sent for analysis. Ten were confirmed positive by RT-qPCR for RHDV 2...|$|R
40|$|A broiler {{breeder flock}} was subcutaneously vaccinated at the {{hatchery}} {{with a live}} avian orthoreovirus (ARV) vaccine against viral arthritis. Chicks began to die at 3 days of age and postmortem examination revealed massive subcutaneous hemorrhages and edema on the dorsal aspect of the neck {{at the site of}} vaccination, a severe <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> and pulmonary edema. Microscopically, the main lesion was a multifocal vacuolar degeneration and necrosis of randomly distributed small groups of hepatocytes with presence of apoptotic and multinucleated syncytial cells. Necrotic foci were also found in the lungs as well as a hemorrhagic, granulomatous, and heterophilic cellulitis and myositis of the neck and a generalized depletion and lymphocytolysis of lymphoid organs. At 8 days of age, birds also began to show hock swelling histologically characterized by a fibrinoleucocytic inflammation of the articulation and tendon sheaths, with hyperplasia of the synovial membrane, and lymphoplasmocytic infiltration. PCR and viral culture of livers were positive for ARV. Partial sequencing of the S 1 gene from the virus isolate showed 99. 2 % to 99. 8 % homology with three vaccinal strains (ARV S 1133, 1733, and 2408). Viral particles compatible with reovirus virions were observed at transmission electron microscopy. Investigation at the hatchery revealed that chicks were inadvertently administered an S 1133 reovirus vaccine labeled for water administration in 10 - to 17 -week-old chickens. This human error is most likely the reason for this unusually severe viremic reovirus infection that affected this flock at such an early age...|$|R
40|$|Rift Valley fever {{phlebovirus}} (RVFV) causes {{high rates}} of abortions and fetal malformations in ruminants, and hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, or blindness in humans. Viral transmission occurs via mosquito vectors in endemic areas, which necessitates regular vaccination of susceptible livestock animals to prevent the RVF outbreaks. Although ZH 501 strain {{has been used as}} a challenge strain for past vaccine efficacy studies, further characterization of other RVFV strains is important to optimize ruminant and nonhuman primate RVFV challenge models. This study aimed to characterize the virulence of wild-type RVFV strains belonging to different genetic lineages in outbred CD 1 mice. Mice were intraperitoneally infected with 1 x 103 PFU of wild-type ZH 501, Kenya 9800523, Kenya 90058, Saudi Arabia 200010911, OS 1, OS 7, SA 75, Entebbe, or SA 51 strains. Among them, mice infected with SA 51, Entebbe, or OS 7 strain showed rapid dissemination of virus in livers and peracute <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> at 2 - 3 dpi. Recombinant SA 51 (rSA 51) and Zinga (rZinga) strains were recovered by reverse genetics, and their virulence was also tested in CD 1 mice. The rSA 51 strain reproduced peracute RVF disease in mice, whereas the rZinga strain showed a similar virulence with that of rZH 501 strain. This study showed that RVFV strains in different genetic lineages display distinct virulence in outbred mice. Importantly, since wild-type RVFV strains contain defective-interfering RNA or various genetic subpopulations during passage from original viral isolations, recombinant RVFV strains generated by reverse genetics will be better suitable for reproducible challenge studies for vaccine development as well as pathological studies...|$|R
40|$|Severe {{adverse effects}} due to 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) are {{reported}} {{with increasing frequency}} in the medical literature. The signs of acute toxicity most often seen are fulminant hyperthermia, hyperexcitatory states, acute renal failure and hyponatraemia. In 1992, hepatotoxicity was also described with unexplained jaundice and hepatomegaly after ingestion of MDMA. We report a case of severe toxic hepatitis following ingestion of MDMA with fulminant hepatic failure which required auxiliary liver transplantation. The diagnosis was <b>necrotic</b> toxic <b>hepatitis</b> following ecstasy ingestion. The outcome was successful, and the patient was discharged from ICU 20 d after surgery.

40|$|In May 2003, an {{outbreak}} of fatal hemorrhagic fever, caused by yellow fever virus, occurred in southern Sudan. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the virus belonged to the East African genotype, which supports the contention that yellow fever is endemic in East Africa {{with the potential to}} cause large outbreaks in humans. Yellow fever virus (genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae) is a mosquitoborne virus endemic in tropical regions of Africa and South America, where it has been responsible for large epidemics. The virus is maintained in sylvatic transmission cycles involving nonhuman primates but uses humans as the sole vertebrate host in urban epidemics. In South America, the sylvatic vectors belong to the Haemogogus and Sabethes genera, and the urban vector is Aedes aegypti; in Africa, Aedes species mosquitoes serve as both sylvatic and urban vectors. The virus causes febrile disease with <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> in humans, and death rates can exceed 50 %. Although an effective vaccine is available, the virus remains a major public health threat, particularly in Africa, where vaccination is limited by poverty, civil wars, and the inaccessibility of rural areas where outbreaks of the disease occur. The World Health Organization estimates 200, 000 cases of the disease occur annually and 30, 000 deaths, but because of underreporting, {{only a small percentage of}} these cases are recorded. The first genetic studies of yellow fever virus identified three topotypes, which corresponded with the virus’s geographic distribution in West Africa, Central and East Africa, and South America (1).

Furthermore, the presence of <b>infectious</b> focus (i.e. <b>necrotic</b> cecum) in CLP mice is in line with the clinical scenario given that a continuous septic focus is frequently present in septic patients despite attempts at appropriate source control [22]. We purposely used healthy, young (4  weeks old) outbred mice: this allowed us (1) to directly examine the link between the development of organ injury/dysfunction in the consistently robust hyperinflammatory environment [23] and (2) to avoid strong confounding factors such as age [24] and comorbidities [25].|$|R
40|$|During routine {{harvest of}} murine {{resident}} peritoneal cells for macrophage function assays the authors recently noted that mice showed a 3 - 4 -fold spontaneous increase {{in number of}} peritoneal cells within 1 week of being placed {{in one of their}} animal rooms. While the mice appeared clinically normal, the collected macrophages had highly convoluted membranes, showed enhanced spontaneous tumor cell killing, and showed increased erythrophagocytosis. Histopathologic findings included mild peritonitis and occasional foci of individual hepatocyte necrosis. The results of routine murine serologic studies and bacterial cultures of the peritoneal cavity were negative. Immunosuppressed mice placed in this room showed severe hepatic necrosis within 4 days, and ultrastructural particles characteristic of corona virus could be demonstrated in the <b>necrotic</b> foci. Mouse <b>hepatitis</b> virus (MHV) was isolated from these livers. Untreated mice showed positive MHV titers, as detected by the enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) after 21 days in the room.

40|$|When {{cells are}} {{infected}} with virus, a chain of biochemical processes are initiated to protect the host cell and organism. Some of these processes are effectuated immediately (innate immunity) whilst other processes might need several days before becoming effective (adaptive immunity). An {{essential part of the}} innate immune system is the receptors which recognize extracellular or endocytosed/phagocytosed foreign organisms (TLR). In addition there are cytoplasmic receptors (the RLHs RIG-I and MDA- 5 or the NLRs) that initiate signaling cascades upon interaction with foreign macromolecules. When these receptors bind foreign molecules, chain-reactions lead to the synthesis and secretion of interferons, certain interleukins, and the activation of different caspases mediating regulated cell-death (apoptosis). The NLRs recognize bacterial components like peptidoglycan containing diaminopimelic-acid or muramyl dipeptide, while the RLHs recognize viral components. When RIG-I bind to viral RNA, down-stream signaling leads to the activation of a mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) that result in increased production of interferon. Activation of virus responsive genes is not always sufficient for protection of salmon against acute infections with the highly pathogenic viruses. The diseases causing the highest ecological and economic impacts in farmed fish in Europe are caused by RNA-viruses. In this thesis two pathogenic viruses that are the causative agents of two important fish diseases in aquaculture are studied; Infectious Salmon Anemia Virus (ISAV) and <b>Infectious</b> Pancreatic <b>Necrotic</b> Virus (IPNV). Cell lines from Atlantic salmon were infected with these viruses to study the intracellular biochemical changes that are initiated upon infection. In this thesis the importance of the pattern recognition receptor RIG-I and the signaling protein MAVS were studied by transfecting cells with plasmids containing genes coding for these proteins. The effect of overexpressing these proteins on virus replication and CPE were analyzed. In addition to this, the subcellular localization of these proteins was studied by transfecting cells with plasmids coding for variants of RIG-I and MAVS protein fused to Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Fluorescence microscopy was utilized to observe and study the effect of virus infection on intracellular localization. Our findings do not conclusively demonstrate that overexpression of RIG-I or MAVS protect the cells from ISAV or IPNV infection...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological, clinical, and {{experimental}} approaches have convincingly demonstrated that host resistance to infection with intracellular pathogens is significantly influenced by genetic polymorphisms. Using a mouse model of infection with virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), we have previously identified the sst 1 locus as a genetic determinant of host resistance to tuberculosis. In {{this study we}} demonstrate that susceptibility to another intracellular pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes, is also influenced by the sst 1 locus. The contribution of sst 1 to anti-listerial immunity is much greater in immunodeficient scid mice, indicating that this locus controls innate immunity and becomes particularly important when adaptive immunity is significantly depressed. Similar to our previous observations using infection with MTB, the resistant allele of sst 1 prevents formation of <b>necrotic</b> <b>infectious</b> lesions in vivo. We have shown that macrophages obtained from sst 1 -resistant congenic mice possess superior ability to kill L. monocytogenes in vitro. The bactericidal effect of sst 1 is dependent on IFN-gamma activation and reactive oxygen radical production by activated macrophages after infection, but is independent of NO production. It is possible {{that there is a}} single gene that controls common IFN-dependent macrophage function, which is important in the pathogenesis of infections caused by both MTB and L. monocytogenes. However, host resistance to the two pathogens may be controlled by two different polymorphic genes encoded within the sst 1 locus. The polymorphic gene(s) encoded within the sst 1 locus that controls macrophage interactions with the two intracellular pathogens remains to be elucidated...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. C-reactive protein (CRP), {{discovered}} in 1930, historically {{has been used}} only to detect and predict the outcome of various <b>infectious,</b> inflammatory and <b>necrotic</b> processes and to assess the efficacy of treatment of those processes. As {{it became clear that}} all stages of atherosclerosis might be considered as an inflammatory response to injury, CRP in its reference values (up to 10 mg/L) arose as one of the “emerging risk factors” for cardiovascular disease. Measurement of its plasma concentrations by high-sensitivity analytical methods, {{in the absence of an}} overt infective or inflammatory episode, has been proven to have a predictive value for first coronary heart disease event. Moreover, recent studies point hsCRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) as a marker for all-cause mortality in general population and patients on hemodialysis. Materials and Methods. Because of the wide diagnostic significance of hsCRP, different methods for its accurate measurement were developed. The aim of this study was to compare the results obtained by immunoturbidimetric and immunochemiluminiscent method. Furthermore, the immunoturbidimetric method was used to assess the predictive value of hsCRP for all-cause mortality in patients on chronic hemodialysis treatment. Results and Discussions. hsCRP was measured in total of 61 random serum samples, within and above reference value, by immunoturbidimetric (Beckman Coulter, AU 400 analyzer) and immunochemiluminiscent (Siemens, Immulite analyzer) method. Excellent correlation was found between methods: r= 9986; regression analysis: АU 400 = 0, 904 Immulite - 0, 100. Except for values below 1 mg/L where immunochemiluminiscent method gave in average slightly lower results (n= 17; 0, 52 ± 0, 26 : 0, 54 ± 0, 25; p 3 mg/L (n = 16; mean age 66 ± 9 years, range from 53 – 78 years; mean duration of hemodialysis 9 ± 7 years, range from 2 – 29 years).

Mycobacterium ulcerans is the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} Buruli ulcer (BU), a serious tropical, necrotizing skin disease {{that can cause}} terrible deformities and disabilities if not treated at early stages. This pathogen was first identified in 1948 by MacCallum and colleagues in Australia; however, until the last decade, BU has received little attention from the scientific community. BU affects mainly rural and poor communities in Africa. Different control measures have been suggested, however, associated with BU, {{there is a strong}} social stigma, and BU is often seen as a curse rather than a disease. Thus, the development of a specific vaccine would be the most satisfactory strategy to control BU. It is therefore critical to advance the knowledge on the host/parasite interactions concerning this enigmatic disease. The pathology of BU is closely associated with mycolactone, a polyketide exotoxin produced by M. ulcerans and which is the major virulence factor of the agent of BU. It is known that cell wall-associated mycolactone or free toxin that diffuses across the tissues, induces apoptosis and necrosis of cells, and, ultimately, the formation of ulcers. Indeed, tissue necrosis and extracellular clumps of M. ulcerans bacilli are the histopathological hallmark of BU. The extensiveness of necrotic areas devoid of cells, which expand, possibly due to mycolactone diffusion, beyond areas where M. ulcerans bacilli can be found, has lead to the assumption that M. ulcerans induces low or absent cellular inflammatory responses. Additionally, the presence of large clumps of free bacteria in the central acellular areas directed early investigators to classify M. ulcerans as an extracellular pathogen, an exception among pathogenic mycobacteria. In contrast, many reports have described the occurrence of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses in BU patients, strongly suggesting that macrophages play an effector role in the control of infection. The use of an animal model of infection, in which it is possible to analyze the entire lesion at very early time points, is essential to understand the interaction of M. ulcerans with the host immune cells, particularly phagocytes. Previous work from our laboratory in the mouse footpad model of infection has shown that inoculation of M. ulcerans in the subcutaneous tissue induces an inflammatory cellular response with the involvement of macrophages and neutrophils. Moreover, our group has shown that even in advanced lesions, inflammatory cells are consistently present, although restricted to the periphery of the <b>necrotic</b> <b>infectious</b> center. The constant availability of phagocytes to interact with M. ulcerans, at the persistent areas of inflammatory cellular infiltration, directed me to reevaluate the interaction of this pathogenic mycobacterium with the host macrophages, in the context of my PhD thesis, both in human and in experimental infections. In experimental murine infections, we showed that M. ulcerans bacilli were phagocytosed in the subcutaneous tissue early after infection. At later time points, as previously described, we found free M. ulcerans organisms concentrated in central necrotic acellular areas. Surrounding these necrotic areas, where inflammatory infiltrates could be seen, M. ulcerans bacilli were however found mainly within macrophages. A histological evaluation of serial sections of BU tissue samples from 15 African patients with inflammatory infiltrates, confirmed the occurrence in 8 patients of intracellular bacilli within phagocytes infiltrating the peripheral areas. In vitro, at low multiplicities of infection (MOI), we found that M. ulcerans was efficiently phagocytosed by macrophages, at similar rates as those for the intracellular pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Within macrophages, M. ulcerans was found surrounded by the phagosomal membrane in tight or spacious phagosomes. We also demonstrated that both virulent, mycolactone-producing, as well as mutant, nonproducing strains grew inside cultured macrophages when low MOIs were used to prevent mycolactoneassociated cytotoxicity. After this initial phase of intracellular residence and proliferation, mycolactone-producing strains were found to lyse the macrophage, becoming extracellular. These results suggest that M. ulcerans is an intracellular pathogen like the other virulent mycobacteria, which explains the reported occurrence of CMI and DTH in model and human cases of M. ulcerans infection. Following the demonstration of an intramacrophage growth phase for the agent of BU, our work focused on the role played by cytokines that are associated with the host resistance to intracellular pathogens. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) are two cytokines with {{a key role in the}} activation of macrophages, required to the control of intracellular mycobacteria. A previous report showed that a lipidic fraction of M. ulcerans culture filtrates containing mycolactone suppressed the production of TNF by cultured human monocytes. On the other hand, the expression of TNF has been reported in BU lesions. Therefore, we considered pertinent to study the effect of the infection with different strains of M. ulcerans on the production of this cytokine by macrophages, as well as to assess in vivo the role played by TNF in infections by M. ulcerans. We confirmed previous observations of other authors by showing that mycolactone inhibits TNF production, in a dose-dependent manner, and we have expanded these observations by using a model of primary mouse macrophages infected with live M. ulcerans bacilli producing different types of mycolactone and displaying different degrees of virulence. Our work shows that macrophages infected with highly virulent M. ulcerans produce much lower levels of TNF, as compared with macrophages infected with intermediate or nonvirulent strains. The reduced production of TNF, including at low MOIs, was not due to an early death of infected macrophages, since the production of the inflammatory chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein- 2 (MIP- 2) was not inhibited in macrophages infected with the highly virulent strain. Finally, we showed that TNF induced during M. ulcerans infection plays a protective role, since TNF-p 55 -defficient mice were more susceptible to nonvirulent and intermediate virulent strains of M. ulcerans when compared to wild-type mice. IFN-γ is a key cytokine in the activation of the macrophage’s microbicidal mechanisms required for the control of intracellular pathogens. We showed that IFN-γ-deficient mice displayed an increased susceptibility to infection by nonvirulent and intermediate virulent strains of M. ulcerans, but not to a highly virulent strain. In vitro, IFN-γ-activated macrophages control the proliferation of the nonvirulent strain as well as the intermediate virulent strain at a low MOI. For the nonvirulent strain, the intramacrophage mechanism of control was nitric oxide (NO) dependent, since with the inhibition of NO production, macrophages were no longer able to control the proliferation of this strain. Contrarily, NO production was not detected in macrophages infected with intermediate and highly virulent strains. However, macrophages infected with the intermediate virulent, as well as with the nonvirulent strain, expressed LRG- 47, being this indicative of phagosome maturation. In summary, we have shown that M. ulcerans, like the other pathogenic mycobacteria, has a phase of intramacrophage residence and multiplication. Additionally, we demonstrated that M. ulcerans induces the production of TNF by infected macrophages and that this cytokine plays a protective role in experimental BU; however, mycolactone, the toxin produced by M. ulcerans, inhibits the production of this cytokine. We also demonstrate that IFN-γ is required to the induction of NO and phagosome maturation which are the macrophage’s microbicidal mechanisms required to control intracellularly M. ulcerans proliferation. Taken together, the results here presented are in accordance with the data in the literature showing that resistance to M. ulcerans infections are associated with CMI and DTH. The peculiarity of the immunology of M. ulcerans infections lies in the association of the mycobacterial nature of this microorganism with its unique capacity to secrete a potent cytotoxic exotoxin which influences CMI. These findings have potential relevance for the development of a vaccine against BU targeting cellular immune mechanisms associated with the activation of the macrophage effector functions. A bactéria Mycobacterium ulcerans é o agente etiológico da úlcera do Buruli (BU), uma doença tropical necrotizante que afecta a pele, causando deformidades terríveis se não for tratada numa fase precoce. Este agente patogénico foi identificado pela primeira vez por MacCallum et al. em 1948 na Austrália; no entanto, até à última década, a BU passou, praticamente, despercebida à comunidade científica. A BU afecta essencialmente comunidades rurais, pobres, de Africa. Diferentes medidas têm sido sugeridas para controlar a BU, no entanto, associado a esta doença existe um estigma social muito forte, sendo que, frequentemente, a BU é vista como uma maldição e não como uma doença. Assim sendo, o desenvolvimento de uma vacina contra a BU seria a estratégia mais adequada para a controlar a doença. Para tal, é essencial aumentar o reduzido conhecimento existente, no que respeita à interacção hospedeiro/agente infeccioso. A patologia da BU está intimamente associada com a micolactona, uma exotoxina produzida pelo M. ulcerans, sendo este o factor de virulência mais importante do agente da BU. É sabido que a micolactona associada à parede celular, ou livre, que se difunde pelos tecidos, induz apoptose e necrose das células do hospedeiro, levando à formação de|$|R
