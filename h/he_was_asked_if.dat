During {{the time that he}} received treatment for his wounds, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he had any requests. His answer was that he had two: First, he wanted a promotion for the corporal who helped rescue him, and second he wanted to be an American citizen.|$|E
5|$|Tired of the {{constant}} violence, Stuart quit hockey after the Stanley Cup championship in 1907 and joined his father in construction. As part of this job, Stuart was sent to Belleville, Ontario, to oversee {{the building of the}} Belleville Drill Shed, one of his father's contracts. While in Belleville, he continued to receive offers to join a new hockey team. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he wanted to manage the Belleville team; a similar offer came from Peterborough, Ontario, while a town outside Toronto was said to have offered a railroad president's salary if Stuart would join them. On the afternoon of June 23, 1907, Stuart went to the Bay of Quinte, near Belleville, to swim with some friends. Stuart swam to the nearby lighthouse, about half a kilometre away from his group, climbed onto a platform and dived into the shallow water. He dived head first onto jagged rocks, gashing his head and breaking his neck. He was killed instantly. His body was brought back to Ottawa, where a service was held at his family's home before he was buried at Beechwood Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|When {{during a}} {{televised}} press conference <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he believed a presidential system was {{possible in a}} unitary state. Erdoğan affirmed this and cited Nazi Germany {{as an example of}} how this is possible. However, the Turkish president's office said that Erdoğan was not advocating a Hitler-style government when he called for a state system with a strong executive. Furthermore, that the Turkish president had declared the Holocaust, anti-semitism and Islamophobia as crimes against humanity and that it was out of the question for him to cite Hitler's Germany as a good example.|$|E

25|$|The {{province}} {{of his birth}} remains unknown, though various conjectures suggest Gallia Belgica, Gallia Narbonensis, or Northern Italy. His marriage to the daughter of Narbonensian senator Gnaeus Julius Agricola implies that he came from Gallia Narbonensis. Tacitus' dedication to Lucius Fabius Justus in the Dialogus may indicate a connection with Spain, and his friendship with Pliny suggests origins in northern Italy. No evidence exists, however, that Pliny's friends from northern Italy knew Tacitus, nor do Pliny's letters hint {{that the two men}} had a common background. Pliny Book 9, Letter 23 reports that, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he was Italian or provincial, he gave an unclear answer, and so was asked if he was Tacitus or Pliny. Since Pliny was from Italy, some infer that Tacitus was from the provinces, probably Gallia Narbonensis.|$|E
25|$|Maroto was in Toledo as {{commanding}} general of that province {{when he was}} visited by Ignacio de Negri y Mendizábal, Count of Negri, {{one of the principal}} Carlist conspirators of 1833. After their conversation, Maroto spent some time considering the revolutionary cause and finally decided, with great calm and certainty, to join it. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if,</b> given his position and standing {{at the head of a}} garrison, he could carry out a military coup, which would have given great support to the cause. Rafael Maroto was a proper and loyal man, and this proposal did not seem ethical to him. He did not want his enlistment in the Carlist ranks to start with a betrayal of the flag to which he had sworn allegiance, or with a flight. He decided to follow a legal path, and started by resigning his command and position within the comandancia general. Once he had broken this link, nothing was in the way of his going over to the other side.|$|E
25|$|After {{recording}} an 8–8 {{record in}} 1988, Elway once again led {{his team to}} the Super Bowl after the 1989 season, with yet another win over the Browns in the AFC championship game, going on to face the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIV. However this game ended even worse for the Broncos than their previous Super Bowl losses. San Francisco blew out Denver 55–10, the most lopsided score in Super Bowl history. Although Elway scored the only touchdown for his team on a three-yard run, his performance was abysmal: 10 out of 26 completions for 108 yards with no touchdown passes and two interceptions. But he didn't try {{to hide from the}} media after the game or downplay his dismal performance. And when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he {{wanted to go back to}} the Super Bowl after three losses, he responded that he wanted to go back every year, even if his team kept losing. Still by this point, many doubted that he would ever win a Super Bowl in his career.|$|E

500|$|The {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} an inquisitorial style; witnesses were not expected to make statements but only to respond to questions asked of them. Bartlett has observed {{that some of the}} questions asked by the commissioners were rather leading. During Cragh's interrogation, for instance, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> [...] "in his country after the time of his hanging, it was publicly and commonly ascribed, and still is ascribed, to a miracle performed by the merits of the Lord Saint Thomas that he obtained and recovered life after the hanging". Cragh of course had no motivation other than to answer [...] "yes", which he did.|$|E
500|$|In December 2006, George W. Bush showed dissatisfaction when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he was {{in denial}} about the {{situation}} in Iraq (the most Bush had said about the situation was that the increase in attacks was [...] "unsettling"). Bush replied [...] "It's bad in Iraq. Does that help?". He had another run-in with Bush at a press conference at Camp David, when Bush asked him [...] "you still hanging around?". He then suggested to Robinson, with reference {{to the fact that it}} was a hot day, that [...] "next time you should cover your bald head". As Bush walked away, Robinson replied [...] "I didn't know you cared", to which Bush responded [...] "I don't". Robinson described his quip as a [...] "fatal error" [...] on his blog. In a final encounter in 2008, Bush joked with Robinson about still not wearing his hat.|$|E
500|$|On 8 June 2008, {{news reports}} {{indicated}} that Pratchett had an experience {{which he described}} as: [...] "It is just possible that once you have got past all the gods that we have created with big beards and many human traits, just beyond all that, {{on the other side}} of physics, there just may be the ordered structure from which everything flows" [...] and [...] "I don't actually believe in anyone who could have put that in my head". He went into further detail on Front Row, in which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> this was a shift in his beliefs: [...] "A shift in me in the sense I heard my father talk to me when I was in the garden one day. But I'm absolutely certain that what I heard was my memories of my father. An engram, or something in my head...This is not about God, but somewhere around there is where gods come from." ...|$|E
5000|$|Columbo's {{first name}} is never {{explicitly}} mentioned during the series. Even the opening credits just simply read, [...] "Peter Falk as Columbo". When asked, Columbo always emphatically answers [...] "Lieutenant". In the episode [...] "By Dawn's Early Light", when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has a first name, he replies {{that the only}} person who [...] "calls" [...] him [...] "that" [...] is his wife.|$|R

50|$|If {{a novice}} chooses to leave {{during the period}} of the novitiate, no penalty <b>is</b> incurred. <b>He</b> may also <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to leave at any time if his {{behaviour}} does not conform to the monastic life, or if the superior discerns that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not called to monasticism. When the abbot or abbess deems the novice ready, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wishes to join the monastery. Some, out of humility, will choose to remain novices all their lives. Every stage of the monastic life must be entered into voluntarily.|$|R
500|$|Idol briefly responded {{once more}} to the {{negative}} reception the album received on two occasions. In 1996, Idol gave an interview for his website in which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he'd pursue the style of Cyberpunk for a future album. Idol addressed the question by first explaining his interpretation {{of the failure of}} the album. [...] "You see the thing about Cyberpunk is that {{it was supposed to be}} like a homemade record, much like these rap bands are doing, all made really on home equipment. But it was very hard to make people understand that I was sort of making an alternative record. They don't allow you to make an alternative record..." [...] He then stated that he would not be pursuing the same style with any future album. In a 2005 interview, Idol simply stated [...] "...the idea that I was trying to do an overground-underground record just wasn't understood at the time." [...] Tony Dimitriades, a prominent music industry producer and manager, interpreted Idol's response at the time. [...] "He realized at that point, 'Well, if that's what people think, maybe I lost touch with my public.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2010, it was {{announced}} that actor Matt Damon would guest star on 30 Rock. He made his debut in the fourth season finale episode [...] "I Do Do" [...] as Carol, an airline pilot and love interest for Fey's character, Liz Lemon, and reprised the role in [...] "The Fabian Strategy". In December 2009, prior to the confirmation of his first guest appearance, Entertainment Weekly informed Damon that he {{was at the top of}} Fey's guest star wish list for the show. A fan of the series, Damon replied [...] "I would do [...] in a heartbeat if they asked me to come on. She should call my people—or even better me. Or I could call her. Let's make this happen." [...] A day after the airing of [...] "I Do Do" [...] <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he would reprise his role as Carol in the upcoming season and responded [...] "If they'll have me, I would love to pop in and see the gang again. I had a great time doing it." [...] In August 2010, Fey confirmed Damon's return saying that he would play her boyfriend once the new season began.|$|E
500|$|On {{the same}} interview, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> his perfect idea of {{encounter}} {{was the same}} as described in the track, one in which your partner is screaming to you, [...] "Give it to me, baby, give it to me, motherfucker" [...] and having attracted the attention of the cops due to the violent noises you are making with your partner outside while [...] "trying to get in". To this question Mars said [...] "It definitely sounds awesome. Right? Isn't that what matters? It's an awesome song! I don't know how to tell you that more". In another interview, this time for Rolling Stone, he explained that the track is about [...] "good old animalistic sex". When the interviewer asked if Mars was concerned with the verses [...] "Got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker" [...] due to his 2010 drug bust, he replied [...] "To take that line out would dilute my art", since the recording [...] "needs a sense of danger. When I was a kid, pop could be dangerous but still massive. Michael Jackson would grab his crotch. Prince would rock assless chaps".|$|E
25|$|While Steiner {{generally}} takes {{things very}} seriously, he also reveals an unexpected deadpan humor: when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> once <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had ever read anything trivial as a child, he replied, Moby-Dick.|$|R
60|$|Mike {{corrected}} {{the rash}} guess, {{and gave his}} name. It struck him as a curious coincidence that <b>he</b> should <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> his name <b>were</b> Smith, of all others. Not {{that it is an}} uncommon name.|$|R
5000|$|In The Question #17 {{published}} by DC Comics in 1988, the Question, on whom Rorschach was partly based, actually read {{a copy of}} the Watchmen trade paperback. Question is briefly inspired by the comic and the character of Rorschach, leading him to take a more physically aggressive style of crime fighting. At the end of the issue, having been overpowered in hand-to-hand combat by a pair of villains, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has any final words, and Question remarks, [...] "Rorschach sucks." [...] Rorschach is also featured in a dream sequence experienced by the Question in that issue.|$|R
500|$|She then {{embarked}} on an affair with fellow resident Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson). Kelly stated during an interview that she felt Becky was [...] "punching above her weight" [...] with Jason. Kelly revealed that she felt Steve was the best man for Becky over her previous lover Jason, stating: [...] "Both boys bring out different things in Becky. With Jason, they liked going clubbing, {{and it was no}} strings attached, I think Becky needs more than that, even though she wouldn't admit it. I think, long-term, Steve's better for her." [...] When Gregson was interviewed by entertainment website Digital Spy, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he thought that his character has had a positive impact on Becky's life. In reply he stated: [...] "I think he's turned it around. She was all over the place getting into trouble all the time but he's made her grow up. And having a little girl there in Amy, that's made her grow a bit, too. She's got responsibilities now. She's besotted with him. She's still a total pisshead, though!" [...] Steve and Becky attempted to marry twice in 2009; their first wedding was given a promotional push from ITV, which aired adverts for the first wedding episodes. Their relationship was featured in a serious of romanctic plots in which ITV dubbed the [...] "Summer of Love" [...] season of the soap, with advertisements airing.|$|E
500|$|Some {{have speculated}} that Clark's {{inexperience}} at giving [...] "soundbite" [...] answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign. The day after he launched his campaign, for example, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he would have voted for the Iraq War Resolution, which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War, a large issue in the 2004 campaign. Clark said, [...] "At the time, I probably would have voted for it, but I think that's too simple a question," [...] then [...] "I don't know if I would have or not. I've said it both ways because {{when you get into}} this, what happens is you have to put yourself in a position—on balance, I probably would have voted for it." [...] Finally, Clark's press secretary clarified his position as [...] "you said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a UN-based solution." [...] After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, The New York Times ran a story with the headline [...] "Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War". Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season. He was forced to continue to clarify his position and at the second primary debate he said, [...] "I think it's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can't get their own story straight... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it's been a huge strategic mistake for this country." ...|$|E
