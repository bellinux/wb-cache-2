5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would have felt silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> needed to change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E
500|$|The {{engineers}} who programmed the Apollo training simulator {{had a difficult}} time keeping the simulator in sync with the continuous changes being made to the spacecraft. According to backup astronaut Walter Cunningham, [...] "We knew that the spacecraft was, you know, in poor shape relative to what it ought to be. We <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> could fly it, but let's face it, it just wasn't as good as it should have been for the job of flying the first manned Apollo mission." [...] NASA pressed on, and mid-January 1967, preparations were being made for the final pre-flight tests of Spacecraft 012.|$|E
500|$|Along the way, the {{production}} team went through drafts {{where the first}} act included far more detail than what {{ended up in the}} final version, such as a troll with a Brooklyn accent who would have explained the backstory behind Elsa's magical powers, and a regent for whom Lee was hoping to cast comedian Louis C.K. After all those details were thoroughly [...] "over-analyzed", they were excised because they amounted to a [...] "much more complex story than really we <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> could fit in this 90-minute film." [...] As Del Vecho put it, [...] "the more we tried to explain things at the beginning, the more complicated it got." ...|$|E

"Oh, Anne," [...] gasped Diana, fairly {{falling on}} the former's neck and weeping with relief and delight, [...] "oh, Anne--we thought--you were--drowned--and <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> murderers--because <b>we</b> had made--you be--Elaine.

500|$|Chester Bennington {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with MTV News, which referred to Linkin Park's new style as being less technical and more organic: [...] "When it came to doing things that <b>felt</b> very much <b>like</b> older Linkin Park, like mixing hip-hop with a rock chorus, [...] <b>felt</b> <b>like,</b> if <b>we</b> were going to do it, we need to really {{do it in a way}} that felt natural and felt original and <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it was something we hadn't done in the past... there are hip-hop songs on the album—'Wretches and Kings', 'When They Come for Me'—they're like nothing the band have tried before: snarling, raw, dark and...strangely organic." ...|$|R
500|$|Gemini, {{with the}} {{exception}} of two songs which were filmed in Switzerland, was shot at AVM Studios. One of the songs, [...] "Penn Oruthi", was shot at Jungfraujoch, the highest railway station in Europe. Part of the song sequence was filmed on a sledge in Switzerland, making it the second Indian film to have done so after the Bollywood film Sangam (1964). Though there were problems in acquiring permission, executive producer M. S. Guhan persisted. The overseas shoots were arranged by Travel Masters, a Chennai-based company owned by former actor N. Ramji. Gemini was completed on schedule and M. Saravanan praised the director, saying, [...] "...we <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were working with S. P. Muthuraman himself, such was Saran's efficiency".|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{opening scene}} depicts a fire fight during the Gulf War. This sequence, which took {{two days to}} film, was shot on a dry expanse of land located an hour outside of Los Angeles. This area had been {{selected}} due to its resembles to an Iraqi desert. Series' co-executive producer Michelle MacLaren said: [...] "We [...] were {{way out in the}} desert and we drove around this corner of these hills and I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> had entered another country. It was so desolate, and there were these stone buildings that looked like a bomb had gone off in them. It was perfect." [...] To add authenticity to the shoot, several of the extras used during this scene were former US military personnel.|$|E
500|$|In March 2010, YouTube began free {{streaming}} {{of certain}} content, including 60 cricket matches of the Indian Premier League. According to YouTube, {{this was the}} first worldwide free online broadcast of a major sporting event. On March 31, 2010, the YouTube website launched a new design, with the aim of simplifying the interface and increasing the time users spend on the site. Google product manager Shiva Rajaraman commented: [...] "We really <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> needed to step back and remove the clutter." [...] In May 2010, YouTube videos were watched more than two billion times per day. This increased to three billion in May 2011, and four billion in January 2012. In February 2017, one billion hours of YouTube was watched every day.|$|E
5000|$|Lovett told NME {{that working}} with James Ford for Wilder Mind {{was part of}} trying {{something}} new. [...] "We felt a need for change. Not from Markus Dravs, {{but he was so}} closely attached to those first two records that as we had taken that time off, we wanted to try doing something new. It <b>felt</b> <b>like,</b> if <b>we</b> do our third record with Markus, does that mean we do our ninth and 10th records with Markus? At some point you have to try different things, as <b>we</b> collectively <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it was time to try other stuff. Markus knows that we might well make the next record with him. We definitely haven't broken up Dravs, we're just playing the field!" ...|$|R

I'm a bit surprised cause, working together with Peter on the new songs on Fate [...] "V" [...] was quite easy regarding the vocal work. It <b>felt</b> just <b>like</b> <b>we</b> left the rehearsalroom yesterday, but today it's almost 13 years ago. I'm ready to give it a second round and if we're lucky and going on a tour again, it would be a wonderful feeling to able to say [...] "hello" [...] to all our fans, if there's any left (laughs) and once again kick some serious ass." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{moment the}} stairs were put down, we scuffled ashore, {{and left the}} steamer {{to go on to}} the Bahamas {{whenever}} she <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it. <b>We</b> gave our valises and trunk-checks to a negro man with a wagon, and told him to take the baggage to a hotel that we could see from the wharf, and then we started off for the fort. But on my way along the wharf I made up my mind that, as the fort had been there for three hundred years, it would probably stand a while longer, and that we had better go along with our baggage, and see about getting a place to live in, for {{we were not going to}} be in any hurry to leave St. Augustine.|$|R
500|$|Writer James Wong was {{disappointed}} with the episode, feeling that he [...] "didn't {{do a great job}} on the script. We wanted to do a show that's all about paranoia and a conspiracy theory, but at the end I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> didn't really gain a lot of new ground or learn a lot of new things. I think we played a lot of texture instead of substance." [...] Series creator Chris Carter on the other hand claimed the episode {{was one of the most}} popular first-season episodes and thought the teaser and the scene with Mulder meeting Deep Throat at a shark tank were memorable. He also praised Jerry Hardin's performance in the episode, finding that he lent the show the [...] "believability" [...] that it needed.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, another rock genre, Britpop, {{emerged in}} part as a {{reaction}} against the dominance of grunge in the United Kingdom. In contrast to the dourness of grunge, Britpop was defined by [...] "youthful exuberance and desire for recognition". The leading Britpop bands, [...] "Blur and Oasis exist as reactionary forces to [...] eternal downcast glare." [...] Britpop artists' new approach was inspired by Blur's tour of the United States {{in the spring of}} 1992. Justine Frischmann, formerly of Suede and leader of Elastica (and at the time in a relationship with Damon Albarn) explained, [...] "Damon and I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were in the thick of it at that point ... it occurred to us that Nirvana were out there, and people were very interested in American music, and there should be some sort of manifesto for the return of Britishness." ...|$|E
500|$|Shooting {{commenced}} {{in early}} November and concluded on November 27, 2007. The strike suspended {{the script for}} the next episode and freed {{the cast and crew}} from an immediate deadline, with the result that more time was spent on filming [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] than the average Lost episode. Shooting did not customarily overlap with the surrounding episodes, although it was produced simultaneously with the [...] mobisodes directed by executive producer Jack Bender and one scene from the season premiere overseen by co-executive producer Jean Higgins. Perrineau hoped the audience would enjoy Michael's return since the cast and crew [...] "busted [...] butts doing this one. It <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were making a movie because there's so much stuff that happens in this episode". Lilly called it [...] "one of the best episodes of the first eight." ...|$|E
5000|$|Burton {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} first win {{of the season in}} front of the crowd; earning him $230,370. He was happy with the result: [...] "That was a heck of a race. It was so much fun racing Matt. I am so appreciative for everyone on this car who stuck with us through times that were tough.", and, [...] "It has been a long time. <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> if <b>we</b> just kept putting ourselves in position then we'd have a good chance. We've been doing that this year." [...] Second-place finisher Edwards congratulated Burton on his victory and said the race was [...] "fun": [...] "We had an awesome Ford Fusion. That's the best car I've ever had here and that was a lot more fun than in the past." ...|$|R
500|$|Since A Thousand Leaves was {{the first}} Sonic Youth album that was {{recorded}} in their own studio, the band had more time and freedom to work on it. As a result, the songs evolved unevenly and were recorded from {{an early stage of}} development. According to guitarist Lee Ranaldo, the album is [...] "a reflection of where we were at the time. We weren't into making anything concise. We were just playing what <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> playing. <b>We</b> really didn't feel <b>like</b> what <b>we</b> needed to be doing was producing another record like Goo." [...] The 11-minute song [...] "Hits of Sunshine (For Allen Ginsberg)" [...] was initially intended to be released on one of the EPs as an instrumental track, but it was ultimately included on the album with vocals. The album was co-produced by the band and Confusion Is Sex producer Wharton Tiers and mastered by Greg Calbi at Masterdisk in New York City.|$|R

Quite soon, after we were married--it was just within a year--I formed a friendship with {{the wife of a}} friend, a woman eight years older than myself.... It wasn't anything splendid, you know. It was just a shabby, stupid, furtive business that began between us. <b>Like</b> stealing. <b>We</b> dressed it in a little music.... I want you to understand clearly that I was indebted to the man in many small ways. I was mean to him.... It was the gratification of an immense necessity. We were two people with a craving. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> thieves. <b>We</b> WERE thieves.... We LIKED each other well enough. Well, my friend found us out, and would give no quarter. He divorced her. How do you like the story?" ...|$|R
500|$|Many of {{the band}} members have {{expressed}} their dissatisfaction with All Hope Is Gone and {{is considered to be}} their least favorite Slipknot album. Feeling discontent over the record's production process, Root said, [...] "it felt a little bit rushed. And it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were trying to do things just to appease a schedule, which I didn't really like." [...] Root was particularly disappointed with the record's producer, Dave Fortman, and said, [...] "Dave Fortman really helped me appreciate Rick Rubin as a producer. [...] wasn't able to get nine people together on the same page and, to me, that's {{the most important thing in}} making a Slipknot record." [...] Conversely, Jordison said, [...] "It's finally the record that I've wanted Slipknot to sound like." [...] He went on to compliment Fortman's ear for tone, and considered All Hope Is Gone to be the band's best album. All Hope Is Gone was mixed by Colin Richardson in Miloco's The Engine Room studio in the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed between October and November 2007 {{in the sixth}} {{production}} block of the series, alongside [...] "Exit Wounds". The sequence of Jack, Ianto and Owen leaving for Gwen's wedding was recorded at Roald Dahl Plass on 25 October 2007. A number of locations {{were used for the}} wedding venue. Producer Richard Stokes notes that [...] "it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were organising a real wedding but one that was being shot in about five different venues". Director Ashley Way states that in directing the wedding scenes, the production team had {{to make sure that the}} colour scheme co-ordinated in regards to aspects like the bridesmaids costumes and the flower patterns. Costume designer Ray Holman experienced difficulty sourcing a maternity wedding dress to accommodate the nine-month baby bump worn by Eve Myles. He remarks that in trying to source three such dresses from bridal shops in Cardiff he was regarded [...] "as if I was the biggest sinner in the world" [...] and ended up designing the dress worn by Gwen himself.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with New York Magazine, Matsoukas explained her response to Beyoncé's proposal: [...] "I was like, 'Let's get into the toxic world and what we really do that is so damaging to ourselves, {{and use it as}} a microcosm for our society'. Obviously, those ideas don't just live in the pageant world; they live in our world. And that's what the song is about. And it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> had to take it there to make it have meaning, because otherwise it would be a superficial, preachy kind of song and visual." [...] A scene from the clip which depicts Beyoncé preparing plastic surgery, consuming diet pills and vomiting, was initially excluded from the video's final cut. However, Beyoncé decided to include the scene to fulfill her role in the clip's premise. Another scene featuring Beyoncé drowning in water while the beauty contest's host questions her life aspirations, was originally intended to depict her falling onstage. However, the scene failed to surface because of time constraints.|$|E
5000|$|Richards said, [...] "Exile was {{a double}} album. And because it’s a double album you’re {{going to be}} hitting {{different}} areas, including D for Down, and the Stones really <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> exiles. <b>We</b> didnt start off intending to make a double album; we just {{went down to the}} south of France to make an album and by the time wed finished we said, We want to put it all out. The point is that the Stones had reached a point where we no longer had to do what we were told to do. Around the time Andrew Oldham left us, wed done our time, things were changing and I was no longer interested in hitting Number One in the charts every time. What I want to do is good shit—if its good theyll get it some time down the road." ...|$|R
2500|$|Regarding the band's {{eventual}} return, Ed Droste noted, [...] "Coming {{back together}} {{to try to}} write and record was like being in junior high again – after you go away for the summer, {{the first couple of}} weeks are slightly awkward when you get back to school. Then, you get back into the swing." [...] Daniel Rossen elaborated, [...] "The whole process with this record <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> starting over. <b>We</b> took enough time off that we... I don't know. My head kind of went out of the game or something. Getting back into it was really confusing. It took a long time." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kristen May stated {{about making}} the record: [...] "When we started writing this record, we had a common hardship. Their singer had quit, and my {{previous}} band had broken up. As writers, we weren't really sure how to move forward. At the same time, we all had this shared feeling of hope and a second chance. Music came out of those experiences from coming together and persevering through whatever doubts and trials we faced in our lives. It <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> home once <b>we</b> began making music." [...] She also stated: [...] "I hope it's an album people can listen to for years to come. We put our hearts and souls into it, and I want them to hear that." ...|$|R
500|$|South Park animators {{created the}} episode using PowerAnimator, the Alias Systems Corporation {{animation}} program most {{commonly known as}} [...] "Alias". It was particularly challenging for animators to design the complex scheme of lights during the episode's disco club scene. Eric Stough, director of animation for the series, said it {{took one of the}} technical directors [...] "about half a day" [...] to set up the brief scene. Parker said he was particularly happy with the animation in [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride", and said he believed the series was starting to settle into the defined look it has retained throughout the years. Parker said, [...] "I think that this was where we finally <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> got it right, we got the look of it right". However, the animation includes some perspective errors, particularly during the football scenes, where Chef stands about as wide as a 10-yard marking on the field. Parker said the animators worked for a long time on the snow in the outdoor scenes, but ultimately decided they did not like how it came out.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} {{backed the}} tenth austerity package which went before Parliament on 16 July. The package {{was the first}} in a series of prior actions necessary for negotiations to open up over bailout funding worth 86billion euros. The package came in two parts, with the first being approved on 16 July, and the second on 23 July. The legislation included a rise in VAT across several goods and services, the abolition of the VAT discount for Greek islands, a corporation tax rise from 26% to 29%, a luxury tax on cars, boats and swimming pools, an end to early retirement by 2022, and an increase in the retirement age to 67. Tsakalotos said on 16 July debate, [...] "I don't know if we did the right thing, however, I do know that we <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> had no other choice but do what we did." [...] The contentious vote was opposed by 109 out of 201 members of the Central Committee of Syriza, and 32 Syriza MPs voted against the proposals on 16 July. It also led to a cabinet reshuffle on 17 July, but Tsakalotos retained his role as Minister of Finance.|$|E
500|$|From {{conception}} {{to final}} release in 2009, drummer Aaron Harris {{estimates that the}} creation and execution of Wavering Radiant took {{about two and a}} half years. During the writing of the record, all of Isis' members were residing permanently within Los Angeles; a situation in contrast to their previous full-length, 2006's In the Absence of Truth; band members were divided between New York and Los Angeles throughout that album's inception and creation. The entire band felt a degree of dissatisfaction with In the Absence of Truth, and Harris felt that the logistical change was beneficial to the writing process, allowing for more time: [...] "rather than feeling like we had limited time to capture something, I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> could take our time with the songs, and come back the next day to work on things rather than in a few weeks". The resulting sound was described by guitarist Michael Gallagher as [...] "more live [...] a little bit dirtier – almost, for lack of a better word, sloppy. But in a good way. We spent a lot of time getting all of our takes as close to perfect as we could on previous records. On this one, we went more with the vibe of the particular take in question." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} four guest artists; Rakim {{from the}} hip hop duo Eric B. & Rakim on [...] "Guilty All the Same", Page Hamilton from the American alternative metal band Helmet on [...] "All for Nothing", Daron Malakian from System of a Down for the song [...] "Rebellion" [...] and Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine fame on the song [...] "Drawbar". Bennington commented on the collaborations, stating that [...] "We really <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> if <b>we</b> need to be inspired and move in another direction. I think when we got Page in, Mike had written this chorus and sang it, and his voice had this tone, and it was unlike anything I'd heard from him before. And I was like, [...] "Dude this is crazy, {{this sounds like a}} Helmet song! It's cool!" [...] And <b>we</b> were <b>like,</b> [...] "Dude, why don't we see if <b>we</b> can get <b>like</b> Page in here?" [...] You know? And if that's why the song says it's feeling like it should be, then why don't we just go straight to the source".|$|R
5000|$|The band started {{recording}} the songs for their 3rd release and first label released full length in mid 2012 at Jonny Bell's (from Crystal Antlers) studio in Long Beach, California. The album was engineered and produced by [...] "Sloppy" [...] Jon B. Gilberts who also produced and engineered New Ghosts / Old Waves. [...] "The Late Great Whatever" [...] {{was released on}} Feb. 26, 2013 through Volcom Entertainment. From the first song, Hear or Anywhere with its prog punk aesthetic and pop heart to the final 12th song Styx and Branches it {{is considered to be}} a furious and infectious garage rock album that draws inspiration from psychedelic surf and punk. The album is also decidedly more heavy and hardcore than New Ghost / Old waves says Brayden Ward, “When people listened to it, we wanted it to feel <b>like</b> how it <b>felt</b> when we were writing it and what it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> when <b>we</b> were writing it was that it was just a little bit dark, and not brooding, black and noir, just a little darker than New Ghost/Old Waves.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Elvis Costello {{also spoke}} {{about how the}} album started, saying: [...] "We were walking off {{the set of the}} show {{together}} after we did “Brilliant Disguise” and Quest dropped this little code phrase to me. I don’t think I ever want to tell people which band, which singer, and what record he named, but I knew what he meant right away. While I knew we couldn’t make that record, I hoped that {{we might be able to}} make this record. It seemed like a good playground, a fabulous ride, to go in and play with a great band that has a broad-minded view of music. It <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> anything was possible." [...] Costello also explained the writing process for the album, saying: [...] "Somebody would lead the way, the same way as any song construction. It was done in dialogue rather than in performance—like the game Exquisite Corpse, where one person's story follows the other, or when you fold a paper doll and then draw the legs on. We had already played together, we knew what that <b>felt</b> <b>like,</b> but <b>we</b> wanted different perspectives. We were really about a work-in-progress, mixing from day one, and developing as the ideas came through. But we didn't need to discuss it very much. We never had one conversation about what we were trying to do, we just did it. We played and the picture emerged, and then you try to sharpen the picture." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Blow" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Marrs Piliero. The video was released on February 25, 2011. Kesha wanted the video to be [...] "different, a video that was cool and random". The director, Piliero, {{came up with the}} idea for the video's mythological aspect saying, [...] "I had this idea running in my head with just the idea of unicorns, If I massacred unicorns, they could bleed rainbows. I'm a fan of violence and I'm always trying to find a way to make it OK." [...] While being interviewed Piliero spoke of the collaboration with Kesha, explaining her point of view on the video, [...] "Before we started filming, we had quite a few talks. She was adamant you can't back away from the crazy; everything about the idea she loved and she enforced the fact that she wanted to embrace every aspect of it and really go for it, On set, she was having fun. She was like, 'I want to lick a unicorn.' It was rad working with her because there definitely wasn't a sense of her feeling awkward about stuff or detached; no ego. It <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> had worked together before." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Vig and Manson met at {{the funeral}} of Pablo Castelaz, the six-year-old son of Dangerbird Records founder Jeff Castelaz, and had a {{conversation}} where, according to Vig, [...] "we <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> had some unfinished business, and we realized how precious life is and how important music has been in our lives." [...] Manson suggested calling guitarists Duke Erikson and Steve Marker {{to get together and}} write some songs. One week later, the group informally convened in Los Angeles, where they laughed, drank, and reminisced of the old days, leaving behind the tensions among them and general weariness that was partly responsible for their 2005 breakup; they set up their equipment and [...] "started fucking around." [...] "We were all pleased to notice on the first day there just didn't seem to be any personal tensions," [...] Vig recalled. [...] "Enough time had passed that any sort of weirdness or tension that had risen between us all had dissipated. So it was easy. There was no one telling us what to do. We weren't signed to a label. We were between managers. So we made this on our own terms." [...] In that session, the group wrote the song [...] "Battle In Me".|$|E
500|$|Nevermind {{not only}} popularized the Seattle grunge {{movement}} but also brought alternative rock {{as a whole}} into the mainstream, establishing its commercial and cultural viability. Neverminds success surprised Nirvana's contemporaries, who felt dwarfed by its impact. Fugazi's Guy Picciotto later commented: [...] "It was like our record {{could have been a}} hobo pissing in the forest for the amount of impact it had. [...] It <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were playing ukuleles all of a sudden because of the disparity of the impact of what they did". Karen Schoemer of the New York Times added that [...] "What's unusual about Nirvana's [...] "Nevermind" [...] is that it caters to neither a mainstream audience nor the indie rock fans who supported the group's debut album." [...] In 1992, Jon Pareles of The New York Times described that {{in the aftermath of the}} album's breakthrough, [...] "Suddenly, all bets are off. No one has the inside track on which of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of ornery, obstreperous, unkempt bands might next appeal to the mall-walking millions". Record company executives offered large advances and record deals to bands, and previous strategies of building audiences for alternative rock bands had been replaced by the opportunity to achieve mainstream popularity quickly.|$|E
5000|$|Diehl, who is 5 ft tall, {{has been}} praised {{for being a}} [...] "normal", healthy size 4 and for not being skinny, a common {{stereotype}} of beauty pageant contestants. Nia Sanchez, {{the winner of the}} 2014 pageant, stated that Diehl is no different than the other athletic pageant contestants she competed against. [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> this year <b>we</b> had a really healthy class of girls, and that’s what the pageant is about, not being skinny and having the clothes fall off your bones, but being fit, healthy and active. And Mekayla is," [...] she said. [...] "We were at the gym working out together. She was telling me how she does different sports. We all do." [...] Diehl has ignited a wave of positivity encouraging women to be healthy and not go to extremes of having unhealthy habits to be skinny.|$|R
500|$|Clifford was {{irritated by}} being placed within a genre by critics, stating that Seefeel [...] "weren't {{trying to fit}} into any one of their scenes and it <b>felt</b> a little <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were almost having {{convention}} thrust upon us when that was the very thing we were reacting against." [...] AllMusic compared the songs to ambient music by the Aphex Twin, while Exclaim! noted that [...] "Quique follows a similar path as Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient work but with structures that a more rock-based band like Chapterhouse dreamed of matching." [...] The members of Seefeel were fans of Aphex Twin and said after playing shows with him and Autechre that they felt [...] "more affinity with them {{than many of the}} bands we'd met – Robin Guthrie and the Cocteau Twins excepted!" ...|$|R
5000|$|On May 2, 2008, Proud Spell contested the 134th {{edition of}} the Kentucky Oaks on a sloppy track at Churchill Downs. Jones had entered both Proud Spell and Eight Belles in the race but opted to run the latter filly in the Kentucky Derby. In a ten-runner field for the Oaks, Proud Spell was made the 3.4/1 {{favorite}} ahead of Country Star (Alcibiades Stakes), Pure Clan, Little Belle and Bsharpsonata. Saez settled the favorite behind the leader Bsharpsonata before moving up on the outside {{to take the lead}} in the straight. She drew away from her opponents in the closing stages to win by five lengths, with Little Belle taking second ahead of Pure Clan. Larry Jones explained that the filly had been unsuited by the synthetic surface at Keeneland and added [...] "We were very fortunate with this filly because she has never been passed in her career. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> if <b>we</b> can run the speed down, she would be in good shape. This filly can run all day long. She is just a quality filly" [...] Brereton Jones, described the winning jockey as [...] "one of the up-and-coming young riders in the country.
