This plan was abandoned on 22 July 1895, when Parliament decided that it should run from Oslo East Station (OsloØ) and via Maridalen. Construction commenced in November. The line was built with a trunk line standard, with 30kilograms per meter (60lb/yd) track. The first section of the line, the Gjøvik Line (then known as the North Line) from Grefsen to Jaren and the Røykenvik Line opened on 18 December 1900. The Alna Line opened on 20 January 1901.|$|E

Their design was based on Indian Army Sheds modified by Major Burke to house aircraft and were pre-fabricated in Glasgow before being transported to Montrose.

25|$|The bladder {{walls are}} very thin and transparent, but are {{sufficiently}} inflexible {{to maintain the}} bladder's shape despite the vacuum created within. The entrance, or 'mouth', of the trap is a circular or oval flap whose upper half is joined {{to the body of}} the trap by very flexible, yielding cells which form an effective hinge. The door rests on a platform formed by the thickening of the bladder wall immediately underneath. A soft but substantial membrane called the velum stretches <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>curve</b> around the middle of this platform, and helps seal the door. A second band of springy cells cross the door just above its lower edge, and provide the flexibility for the bottom of the door to become a bendable 'lip' which can make a perfect seal with the velum.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{believe that}} the CJNG outnumbered the Jalisco State Police during the ambush. According to Luis Carlos Nájera Gutiérrez de Velasco, the Attorney General of Jalisco, the CJNG had at least 80 gunmen on their side. The Jalisco State Police had around 40. In an {{interview}} with the press, he explained the formation of the police units prior to being attacked by the CJNG. The Jalisco State Police was traveling in 10 vehicles; each vehicle paired up with another one – a standard protocol to prevent attacks from organized crime – while crossing through the mountain road where they were ambushed. Of the 10 vehicles, only 4 were attacked. Each of those 4 vehicles had 4 officers in them, totaling 16 (out of those 16, only 1 survived by faking his own death). The CJNG gunmen were hiding in the mountains' sides <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>curve.</b> The gunmen attacked from at least 12 different shooting spots {{from the top of the}} mountains. They used a number of high-calibre assault rifles and ammunition. Among them were AK-47s, AR-15s, 40 mm grenades, and M-60 machine guns, which are capable of firing over 500 shots per minute. Some of the bullets found in the crime scene were specifically for detailed perforation. Nájera Gutiérrez de Velasco explained that the turning point of the attack occurred when the CJNG threw explosives attached to 20 liters of gasoline from the top of the mountains. This burned 4 police vehicles.|$|E
40|$|A 3 D {{non-isotropic}} algebraic stress/flux turbulence {{model is}} employed to simulate turbulent buoyant helicoidal flow and heat transfer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rectangular <b>curved</b> open channel. The prediction shows that, unlike the isothermal flow, {{there are two}} major and one minor secondary flow eddies <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cross section of thermally stratified turbulent buoyant helicoidal flow <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>curved</b> open channel. The results compare favorably with available experimental data. The thermocline <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>curved</b> channel is thicker than that <b>in</b> <b>a</b> straight channel. All of these is the result of complex interaction between the buoyant force, the centrifugal force and the Reynolds stresses. The turbulent flow <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>curved</b> channel is obviously non-isotropic: The turbulence fluctuations in vertical and radial directions are lower in magnitude than that in the axial direction, which illustrates the suppression of turbulence due to buoyant and centrifugal forces. The results are of significant practical value to engineering works such as the choice of sites for intake and pollutant-discharge structures <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>curved</b> river. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.
