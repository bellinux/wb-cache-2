6000|$|That is the perfected {{method of}} the French offensive. I had the {{pleasure}} of learning its broad outlines in good company, in the company of M. Joseph Reinach and Colonel Carence, the military writer. Their talk together and with me in the various messes at which we lunched was for the most part a keen discussion of every detail and every possibility of the offensive machine; every French officer's mess seems a little council upon the one supreme question in France, how to do it best. M. Reinach has made certain suggestions about the co-operation of the French and British that <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>discuss</b> elsewhere, but one great theme was the constitution of [...] "the ideal battery." [...] For years French military thought has been acutely attentive to the best number of guns for effective common action, and has tended rather to the small battery theory. My two companies were playing with the idea that the ideal battery was a battery of one big gun, with its own aeroplane and kite balloon marking for it.|$|E
6000|$|Later <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>discuss</b> {{the powers}} of the League. But before I come to that I would like to say a little about the more general {{question}} of its nature and authority. What sort of gathering will embody it? The suggestions made range from a mere advisory body, rather like the Hague convention, which will merely pronounce on the rights and wrongs of any international conflict, {{to the idea of a}} sort of Super-State, a Parliament of Mankind, a [...] "Super National" [...] Authority, practically taking over the sovereignty of the existing states and empires of the world. Most people's ideas of the League fall between these extremes. They want the League to be something more than an ethical court, they want a League that will act, but on the other hand they shrink from any loss of [...] "our independence." [...] There seems to be a conflict here. There is a real need for many people to tidy up their ideas at this point. We cannot have our cake and eat it. If association is worth while, there must be some sacrifice of freedom to association. As a very distinguished colonial representative said to me the other day: [...] "Here we are talking of the freedom of small nations and the 'self-determination' of peoples, and at the same time of the Council of the League of Nations and all sorts of international controls. Which do we want?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... (3) Most people, {{on hearing}} the {{suggestion}} that it may come to corporal punishment at last (as it did in every slave system I ever heard of, including some that were generally kindly, and even successful), will merely be struck with horror and incredulity, and feel that such a barbarous revival is unthinkable in the modern atmosphere. How far it will be, or need be, {{a revival of the}} actual images and methods of ruder times <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>discuss</b> in a moment. But first, as another of the converging lines tending to corporal punishment, consider this: that for some reason or other the old full-blooded and masculine humanitarianism in this matter has weakened and fallen silent; it has weakened and fallen silent in a very curious manner, the precise reason for which I do not altogether understand. I knew the average Liberal, the average Nonconformist minister, the average Labour Member, the average middle-class Socialist, were, with all their good qualities, very deficient in what I consider a respect for the human soul. But I did imagine that they had the ordinary modern respect for the human body. The fact, however, is clear and incontrovertible. In spite of the horror of all humane people, in spite of the hesitation even of our corrupt and panic-stricken Parliament, measures can now be triumphantly passed for spreading or increasing the use of physical torture, and for applying it to the newest and vaguest categories of crime. Thirty or forty years ago, nay, twenty years ago, when Mr. F. Hugh O'Donnell and others forced a Liberal Government to drop the cat-o-nine-tails like a scorpion, we could have counted on a mass of honest hatred of such things. We cannot count on it now.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> briefly <b>discuss</b> the {{implications}} of the recent quiescent Chandra observation of the long-duration neutron star transient KS 1731 – 260 (Wijnands et al. 2001 a) on models for quiescent systems other than the Brown et al. (1998) cooling neutron star model. However, the Chandra results are not very constraining; for those models to be consistent with the data, one only has to assume that the system parameters of KS 1731 – 260 (e. g., the neutron star spin rate and magnetic field properties; orbital parameters) are very {{similar to those of the}} other systems. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> also <b>discuss</b> the available quiescent data of other long-duration neutron star transients in the context of the Brown et al.
