5|$|The Phoenix Zoo {{garnered}} worldwide {{attention for}} one of its animals, an Asian elephant named Ruby. Ruby came to the zoo in 1973, just months after being born in Thailand. After noticing Ruby doodling in the sand with sticks, her keeper decided {{to give her a}} brush and paint. Ruby quickly became known for her paintings, whose sales raised over US$200,000 for the zoo. Art collectors all over the world joined 18-month waiting lists and paid <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> for original prints.|$|E
5|$|The coins were minted in August 1918, {{and were}} sold {{to the public for}} $1 each. All sold, though many were held by a bank until 1933, and the profits used to defray the cost of local centennial {{celebrations}} or to help those in need because of World War I. Later writers have generally admired the coin, considering it one of the more handsome American commemoratives. The coin is valued in the <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> today, though exceptional specimens may trade for more.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a lengthy}} {{battle over the}} design between the Commission of Fine Arts and the Vermont {{commission}} in charge of organizing the coin issue, {{as a result of}} which the original designer, Sherry Fry, left the project, replaced by Keck. Although the eventual reverse design of a catamount satisfied the Fine Arts Commission, it has been severely criticized by later writers. The coins did not sell out; over a fourth of the issue was returned for redemption and melting. The coins sell for at least in the <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> today, depending on condition.|$|E

There was a group that prepared and sent out a weekly special bulletin to the parishioners in the Armed Forces. These parishioners were happy to receive news from home on the progress of their new church and many of them sent home money to go towards the building fund. During the war, <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> came in from these parishioners fighting in the war. Of the 808 parishioners who went off to war, seven died and their names were engraved on a piece of granite outside of the church: James DiMuzio, Arthur Capo, Nick Costelli, Justine DeFelices, Neal Chipoletti, and Anthony Zaffuto.|$|E

The Congressional-Executive Commission on China writes that the facilities “are used specifically to detain Falun Gong practitioners who have completed terms in reeducation through labor (RTL) camps but whom authorities refuse to release.” Practitioners who are involuntarily detained in the transformation centers must pay tuition fees amounting to <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars.</b> The fees are extorted from family members {{as well as from}} practitioners’ work units and employers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} IBM PC market (1981–83) the major {{programming}} tool vendors all made compilers that {{worked in a}} similar fashion. For example, the Microsoft Pascal system consisted of two compiler passes and a final linking pass (which could take minutes on systems with only floppy disks for secondary storage, although programs were very much smaller than they are today). This process was less resource-intensive than the later integrated development environment (IDE). Vendors of software development tools aimed their products at professional developers, and the price for these basic tools plus ancillary tools like profilers ran into the <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars.</b>|$|E

Increases {{punishment}} for gang-related felonies; {{death penalty for}} gang-related murder; indeterminate life sentences for home-invasion robbery, carjacking, witness intimidation and drive-by shootings; creates crime of recruiting for gang activities; and authorizes wiretapping for gang activities.

Requires registration of gang members committing felonies; allows disclosure of information on juveniles committing serious felonies; limits sealing of violent offenses committed by juveniles 14 or older; requires statewide reporting of felony juvenile records. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: This measure would result in unknown major net costs to the state <b>of</b> at least <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> millions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> annually and one-time costs of at least several <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> millions <b>of</b> <b>dollars.</b> It would also result in unknown net costs to local governments of at least tens <b>of</b> millions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> annually, and tens <b>of</b> millions to <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> millions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> in one-time costs...|$|R

25|$|In the mid-1980s, {{controversy}} {{erupted in}} the cable programming world as United States media companies that owned pay television channels began scrambling their programming and charging fees to home satellite dish owners who accessed the same satellite signals that cable operators received. Many satellite dish owners faced {{the prospect of having}} to purchase descrambling equipment at a cost of <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars,</b> as well as having to pay monthly or annual subscription fees to cable programming providers. Fees for home dish owners were often higher than fees paid by cable subscribers, despite dish owners being responsible for acquiring and servicing their own equipment.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous {{contribution}} to Scouting that Silber has become known for were his belt buckles. In 1950, Max was chosen to be a Scoutmaster for the National Scout Jamboree. He was in the metal ingot business and had souvenir buckles produced for the event which he gave out as friendship gifts. Over the next half century, he made fifty more buckles for national Scout jamboree, world jamborees, New Hampshire jamborees and other special occasions as well as recognition buckles for significant awards such as Eagle Scout, Vigil Honor, and Wood Badge. His buckles have become world-famous and are considered highly prized collectors' items. Amongst collectors, some of the Silber buckles fetch prices in the <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> as evidenced on auction sites such as eBay.|$|E

According to news reports, a Livingston County jury convicted Taylor on a Class C misdemeanor charge.

25|$|A woman's kimono may easily exceed US$10,000; a {{complete}} kimono outfit, with kimono, undergarments, obi, ties, socks, sandals, and accessories, can exceed US$20,000. A single obi may cost several thousand dollars. However, most kimonos owned by kimono hobbyists or by practitioners of traditional arts {{are far less}} expensive. Enterprising people make their own kimono and undergarments by following a standard pattern, or by recycling older kimonos. Cheaper and machine-made fabrics can substitute for the traditional hand-dyed silk. There is also a thriving business in Japan for second-hand kimonos, which can cost as little as ¥500 (about $6). Women's obi, however, mostly remain an expensive item. Although simple patterned or plain colored ones can cost as little as ¥1,500 (about $18), even a used obi can cost <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars,</b> and experienced craftsmanship is required to make them. Men's obi, even those made from silk, tend to be much less expensive, because they are narrower, shorter and less decorative than those worn by women.|$|E
25|$|Many {{competitors}} offer discount {{prices that}} undercut the major bus lines. Typical fares between East Coast cities range from $10 to $20, compared to major curbside bus lines (which typically cost between $1 and $25), terminal-operated bus lines (which cost between $14 and $35), and Amtrak (which costs about $100.) The industry has become highly competitive with companies offering hourly service between major cities. The Appalachian extensions of these lines tend to offer {{less of a}} price advantage; for example, in August 2006, one-way fares from New York to Pittsburgh on the Chinese-owned All State were $35 compared with $45 advance through Greyhound Lines, while tickets from State College, Pennsylvania, to New York were $35, compared to $46 for Greyhound. Chinatown buses also charge flat fees, while other intercity buses may vary pricing based on demand. Low prices led to high demand for many Chinatown bus routes, and although a single round trip can incur <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> in expenses, a fully booked bus can net at least $340 in profits per round trip after these expenses are paid.|$|E
