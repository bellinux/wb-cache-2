50|$|Sate Padang is a {{speciality}} satay from Padang, West Sumatra, Indonesia, {{made from}} beef {{cut into small}} cubes with spicy sauce on top. Its main characteristic is the thick yellow sauce made from rice flour mixed with beef and offal broth, turmeric, ginger, garlic, coriander, <b>galangal</b> <b>root,</b> cumin, curry powder and salt. In Medan, a lot of Sate Padang use not only beef but also chicken and lamb.|$|E
50|$|Some Thais in Canada {{work in the}} {{restaurant}} industry and Thai cuisine, known for its balance between sweet, sour, salty and spicy flavours, and for its use of fresh herbs, coconut milk and <b>galangal</b> <b>root.</b> This cuisine has become popular in Canada, particularly in urban areas. One notable example of a Thai in this industry is internationally acclaimed chef Sasi Meechai-Lim, who resides in Toronto, where she has opened several restaurants.|$|E
50|$|Chemically, {{quercetin}} is {{a member}} of a fairly extensive class of natural coloring matters derived from phenyl benzoyl-pyrone or flavone, the constitution of which followed on the researches of St von Kostanecki, A. G. Perkin, Herzig, Goldschmidt and others. Among the related, coloring matters are: chrysin from poplar buds, apigenin from parsley, luteolin from weld, mignonette and dyer's broom, fisetin from young fustic and yellow cypress, galangin from <b>galangal</b> <b>root,</b> and myricetin from Nageia nagi.|$|E
40|$|The unique {{characteristics}} of Indonesian cuisine {{is due to}} the use of herbs and spices mixture. One material often used is rhizomes, there are some popular rhizomes used in Indonesia such as ginger, greater <b>galangal,</b> turmeric, finger <b>root,</b> and <b>galangal.</b> People mostly use this rhizome only for adding flavor (taste and aroma) in food, but rhizomes also have another benefit. The {{purpose of this study is}} to present an overview of the literature relates to the function of the rhizomes as flavoring agents in seasoning, natural coloring agents, and food preservative agents, as well as health benefit function. The rhizomes is usually used for cooking, hence the effect of heat treatment on the antioxidant activity, total phenolic and total flavonoid of rhizomes are also important to be studied in this research. The volatile and non-volatile compounds in each rhizome give specific and unique flavor (aroma and taste). These characteristics are important for seasoning. The rhizomes also can act as a natural coloring agent, e. g. turmeric, which contributes to the yellow-orange color. Many researchers also proof that rhizomes can be use as natural food preservative agents. Another important function of rhizomes is the health benefits. In some pharmaceutical research, rhizomes extract are proofed as preventing and curing agents for treating some diseases, this function also related to the antioxidant activity. The chemical analysis showed that rhizome has high antioxidant activity, which is does not denature by heating, as well as the phenolic and flavonoid content of all rhizomes studied. The heating treatment could increase those all chemical characteristics...|$|R
5000|$|Sate Padang: A dish from Padang and the {{surrounding}} area in West Sumatra, which is made from cow or goat offal boiled in spicy broth then grilled. Its main characteristic is a yellow sauce made from rice flour mixed with spicy offal broth, turmeric, ginger, garlic, coriander, <b>galangal</b> <b>root,</b> cumin, curry powder and salt. It is further separated into two sub-variants, the Pariaman and the Padang Panjang, which differ in taste and the composition of their yellow sauces.|$|E
50|$|In the Middle Ages, {{the term}} galauntine or galantyne, perhaps {{with the same}} connotations of gallantry, {{referred}} instead to any of several sauces made from powdered <b>galangal</b> <b>root,</b> usually made from bread crumbs with other ingredients, such as powdered cinnamon, strained and seasoned with salt and pepper. The dish was sometimes boiled or simmered before or after straining, and sometimes left uncooked, depending on the recipe. The sauce was used with fish and eels, and also with geese and venison.|$|E
5000|$|Sate Udang: Shrimp Satay {{that uses}} large shrimps or prawns, shelled and cleaned and {{often with the}} tails off and lightly grilled. Some recipes call for a {{marinade}} of thick coconut milk with sambal (chili paste), powdered laos (<b>galangal</b> <b>root),</b> ground kemiri (candlenut, one can substitute macadamia nuts in a pinch), minced shallots and pressed garlic. One can add salt to taste. Shrimp satay seldom served with the peanut sauce so popular with other satays, because it might overpower a delicate shrimp flavour.|$|E
40|$|Ethyl p-methoxycinnamate and {{ethyl cinnamate}} as a {{phytoestrogen}} in <b>galangal</b> <b>root</b> (Kaempferia galanga L.) {{expected to be}} used for replacing the Hormone Replacement Therapy on prevention osteoporosis and as anti-cholesterol in menopausal women. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore the potential estrogenic effect of <b>galangal</b> <b>root</b> extract on prevention of osteoporosis and as an anti-cholesterol agent. In-silico test is performed to measure the molecular interactions between ethyl p-methoxycinnamate and ethyl cinnamate with estrogen receptor protein (1 QKM) and in-vivo tests conducted by the ovariectomy method on female Wistar rats. Thirty female Wistar rats were divided into six treatment groups. Group I is the normal mice and the group II-VI is the ovariectomies rats. Ovariectomy surgery performed at 70 days of age rats. Group II is the baseline of ovariectomized rats. Group III rats treated with CMC-Na 0. 5 % (control). Group IV rats are treated with estradiol 2 μg/kg BW/day while the group V and VI rats are rats treated with <b>galangal</b> <b>root</b> ethanol extract (500 and 1. 000) mg/kg BW/day. Administration of the test material was performed for 30 days. At the end of the experiment, a blood sample was taken from orbital sinus for measurement of blood lipid levels. All the rats were sacrificed for necropsy procedures. The results showed that <b>galangal</b> <b>root</b> ethanol extracts significantly decrease the cholesterol and LDL levels, and enhance the femur bone density. However, extract has not significantly effect in decrease the triglyceride and enhance the HDL levels of ovariectomized rats. There were almost the same binding energy between ethyl p-methoxycinnamate, ethyl cinnamate and 17 β-estradiol on 1 QKM protein with binding energy is - 94. 9984; - 949 948 and - 94. 9982 respectively...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{identify}} physico-chemical properties, SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) and sensory characteristics of dendeng made from shark flesh (Chiloscyllium sp.). Three drying methods were used in this study and they were sun drying, oven drying and oven vacuum drying. Before drying, the slices with dimension of 4 cmx 12 cmx 3 mm were soaked in a mixture of sugar (20 %), salt (1 %), tamarind (4 %), coriander (1. 5 %), <b>galangal</b> <b>root</b> (2. 5 %), ginger (0. 5 %), garlic (1. 0 %) and onion (1. 0 %) for 12 h. The drying was carried out until the moisture content reached 23 - 25 %. Proximate analysis showed there were no significant differences among these samples but had significant influence (p< 0. 05) on the color. The lightness value for vacuum drying was 32. 19 followed by oven drying (29. 97) and sun drying (28. 92). There were no significant differences in mineral values except for sodium (Na). SEM photograph shows that different drying methods affect the compactness of the tissue structure. Sensory evaluation result indicated that all samples were moderately acceptable but there were no significant difference among the samples. However, shark dendeng using oven drying was most preferred...|$|E
