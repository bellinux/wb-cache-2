5|$|At 22:00 on 16 December 1941, Corregidor {{left its}} dock in Manila in total darkness, loaded to {{overcapacity}} with Filipino civilians seeking {{to escape to}} the southern Philippines after the war had started. It {{has been estimated that}} between 1,200 and 1,500 people were on board, including approximately 150 Philippine soldiers, 7 Americans, 5 Philippine legislators, and hundreds of college students who were traveling home after their schools had closed. Also aboard were military supplies as well the entire artillery complement of the Visayan-Mindanao Force of the Philippine Army. The owners of the ship failed to inform the Navy's <b>Inshore</b> <b>Patrol</b> of the ship's plan to leave Manila Bay.|$|E
5|$|Tulsa {{spent her}} {{first five years}} in Central American waters , {{projecting}} America's naval power among the Central American states. She was later involved in the civil strife in Nicaragua in the late 1920s during which bluejackets and marines from Tulsa helped maintain order ashore. Tulsa was involved in operations in Nicaragua from August 1926 to December 1928. On 1 April 1929, Tulsa was assigned as the flagship of the South China Patrol, which was based in Canton and Hong Kong, and patrolled the Pearl River and South China Sea. In June 1929, she was reassigned to a two-week deployment with the Yangtze Patrol. The following month she was reassigned to Tientsin, to gather intelligence, and reported {{it back to the}} Asiatic Fleet. In May 1941, she was reassigned to the Philippines, and joined the <b>Inshore</b> <b>Patrol,</b> which guarded the littoral zone of Manila Bay.|$|E
25|$|The first 54 Kingfishers were {{delivered}} to the U.S. Navy beginning in August 1940 and six {{had been assigned to}} the Pearl Harbor-based Battle Force {{before the end of the}} same year. Many of the following 158 OS2U-2s were attached to flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, but 53 were assigned to equip the newly established <b>Inshore</b> <b>Patrol</b> Squadrons, based at NAS Jacksonville, Florida. In 1942, nine more <b>Inshore</b> <b>Patrol</b> Squadrons were established, all exclusively equipped with OS2N-1s built by the Naval Aircraft Factory.|$|E

50|$|Though {{assigned}} to New London, Connecticut, as an antiaircraft gunnery school ship specializing in machine-gun training for officer trainees, Zircon also conducted <b>inshore</b> <b>patrols</b> and visited ports from New York City to Casco Bay, Maine. Those duties continued until {{the autumn of}} 1941, at which time she began making mail and dispatch runs between Portland, Maine, and Argentia, Newfoundland.|$|R
25|$|As of 2005 the Lebanese Navy had two French EDIC class LST {{transport}} {{ships of}} 670 ton displacement, five 38 ton Attacker class coastal patrol craft, two Tracker Mk 2 patrol boats of 31 tons, and twenty-five 6 ton <b>inshore</b> <b>patrol</b> craft. Lebanon has no operational fixed wing military aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The tug was commandeered by United States Navy and {{assigned}} to the 16th Naval District on 13 December 1941 under command of Lt. (jg.) Trose E. Donaldson, USNR as the war came to the Philippines. Although the tug was not formally commissioned by the U.S. Navy, it still served in Manila Bay with the Base Section of the Navy's <b>Inshore</b> <b>Patrol.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{weather was}} dark, windy, and rough on 6 December as Trepangs conning tower broke the surface after a day's {{submerged}} <b>inshore</b> <b>patrol</b> off Luzon. While shifting course toward deeper water, she detected {{a group of}} ships approaching from the northward. Upon closing to investigate, Trepang counted seven large ships and three escorts in the convoy which slowly approached the Philippines.|$|E
5000|$|... 15 September 1944: VP-61 began ï¬‚ying <b>inshore</b> <b>patrols</b> {{along the}} {{shipping}} lanes, which extended the complete {{length of the}} Aleutian chain. To facilitate the coverage over these vast distances, the squadron was divided into detachments: Headquarters moved to NS Adak, Detachment 1 went to NAF Amchitka, Detachment 2 to NAS Kodiak, and Detachment 3 went to NAF Dutch Harbor.|$|R

5000|$|The sole {{function}} of No. 255 Squadron {{during the war}} was anti-submarine warfare. Initially, the squadron operated within a zone defined as [...] "10m NW Fishguard to 10m S of Caldey Island", but shortly after its establishment, this was extended to 15 miles south of Caldey Island. The squadron's aircraft did not have wireless telegraphy radio set so were restricted to <b>inshore</b> <b>patrols.</b>|$|R
25|$|She {{continued}} {{under the}} direct operational control of CINCAF into the 1930s, being later reassigned to the South China Patrol and observing conditions {{along the south}} China coast during the period following {{the outbreak of the}} undeclared Sino-Japanese war in July 1937. As tensions increased in the Orient in 1940 and 1941, Admiral Thomas C. Hart, CINCAF, incrementally reduced the Asiatic Fleet's presence in Chinese waters. Withdrawn to the Philippines in May 1941, Tulsa joined the <b>Inshore</b> <b>Patrol,</b> guarding the sea approaches to Manila Bay.|$|E
25|$|The Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) has 2,132 {{full-time}} and 435 part-time sailors. The RNZN possess two Anzac class frigates, developed {{in conjunction with}} Australia, based on the German MEKO 200 design. Nine other vessels are in use, consisting of patrol vessels and logistics vessels. In 2010, the RNZN completed the acquisition of seven new vessels: one large Multi-Role Vessel named the HMNZS Canterbury, two Offshore Patrol Vessels, and four <b>Inshore</b> <b>Patrol</b> Vessels. All of these vessels were acquired under Project Protector, and were built to commercial, not naval, standards.|$|E
25|$|With the {{increasing}} {{tensions in the}} Far East, Admiral Thomas C. Hart, Commander in Chief, US Asiatic Fleet, withdrew Asheville and her sister ship Tulsa to the Philippines. Asheville left Chinese waters {{for the last time}} on 5 July 1941, when she sailed from Amoy for Manila. Unfortunately, the ship's single shaft broke while the ship rode out a typhoon off Swatow. Admiral Hart dispatched Marblehead to bring in the crippled gunboat. The cruiser brought Asheville home on 11 July. Since Admiral Hart had regarded Asheville and Tulsa as having neither the speed with which to run nor the guns with which to fight, he assigned them to the <b>Inshore</b> <b>Patrol</b> based at Manila, where they remained on local patrol duty into December 1941.|$|E
50|$|Recommissioned on 12 March 1952,Ruddy joined Mine Division 72 and, after 11 {{months of}} mine warfare {{exercises}} and fleet amphibious operations, sailed from Long Beach, California, in February 1953 for the Korean combat zone. She arrived off Wonsan, North Korea, on 15 March and began operations {{as a unit}} of the U.N. Blockade and Escort Force. On the 16th, she transported prisoners of war to Yo Do, then returned to Wonsan, whence, for 6 weeks, she conducted <b>inshore</b> <b>patrols.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} other {{branches}} of the then FARK, the Cambodian Navy's own military capabilities in the late 1960s remained low and the missions that they performed mirrored those of a peacetime River Police force or Coast Guard rather than a true Navy. Therefore, MRK activities were restricted to inland patrols on the Bassac River, the Mekong, and the Tonle Sap River {{in the vicinity of}} the namesake Great Lake whilst high seas operations were limited to routine <b>inshore</b> <b>patrolling</b> in the Gulf of Thailand.|$|R
5000|$|In February 1951 Whitesand Bay {{sailed to}} Singapore for support duties off the Malayan coast, {{supporting}} of anti-insurgent operations by carrying out <b>inshore</b> <b>patrols</b> and shore bombardments. In May she was deployed off Borneo for anti-piracy patrols, visiting Jesselton and Sandakan. In June {{she began her}} second UN operational tour, relieving the Canadian destroyer [...] in Task Group 95.22 off Wonsan for patrol and bombardment duties. In July she transferred {{to the west coast}} and joined the British Task Group, carrying out survey work with other British and Commonwealth ships in the Han River.|$|R
2500|$|At 0810, an Army {{observation}} plane sighted the life rafts and reported their position to [...] of the <b>Inshore</b> <b>Patrol.</b> By 1100, when strong winds and rising seas {{forced her to}} abandon her search, she had rescued 12 survivors, one of whom died en route to Cape May. The search for the other survivors of Jones continued by plane and ship {{for the next two}} days, but none were ever found.|$|E
2500|$|The Flower {{class had}} been {{designed}} for <b>inshore</b> <b>patrol</b> and harbour anti-submarine defence; therefore, many required minor modifications when the Allied navies began deploying these vessels as trans-Atlantic convoy escorts. These small warships could be supported by any small dockyard or naval station, so many ships came to {{have a variety of}} different weapons systems and design modifications depending upon when and where they were refitted; there is really {{no such thing as a}} 'standard Flower-class corvette' ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{ships were}} first under fire during the {{bombardment}} of Inchon {{in the middle}} of January 1951. The coastal defence fire was inaccurate, and the ships doubled back and silenced the guns. Another bombardment at Inchon two days later was also successful, without damage. The only Canadian naval casualties of the Korean War occurred on 2 October 1952 during an <b>inshore</b> <b>patrol</b> by [...] on the east coast, inflicted by a coastal defence battery: 3 sailors died and 10 were wounded. Canadian ships destroyed 8 of the 28 trains destroyed by United Nations forces, and [...] alone hit 3 trains.|$|E

50|$|Kane recommissioned 23 September 1939 {{to serve}} in the Neutrality patrol in the North Atlantic. On 7 August she took up <b>inshore</b> {{defensive}} <b>patrol</b> along both coastlines of Panama. She then steamed to San Diego, arriving 4 November 1940, to patrol off the coast of California. She overhauled in the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard from 4 January to 3 March 1941, she was based at Seattle for patrols north to Alaska, and along the western seaboard. After the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor, she departed Seattle, Washington for Kodiak, Alaska, and escorted troop transports back to Seattle 23 December. Following a similar escort voyage, she arrived at Seward 19 April 1942 for inter-island convoy and submarine patrols among Alaskan ports.|$|R
2500|$|On 21 October 1951, Commander William Landymore assumed {{command of}} the ship as a regular vessel of the Royal Canadian Navy. Iroquois served off Korea during the Korean War, {{commanded}} by Landymore. Iroquois departed Halifax on 21 April 1952 and arrived in theatre to replace Cayuga on 12 June. Her first assignment was carrier screening on Korean the west coast. For the majority of 1952, Iroquois supported the Island campaign off the west coast. On 2 October, Iroquois in concert with , was bombarding a rail line {{on the east coast}} southwest of Songjin when she was hit by a shell on the starboard side abreast of 'B' gun. Two men were killed and eleven injured, with one dying later of his injuries. The destroyer remained on station for two weeks before returning to Sasebo. These were the only Royal Canadian Navy casualties in the war. Iroquois saw service screening the aircraft carrier [...] and an <b>inshore</b> <b>patrol</b> on the west coast before sailing for Canada on 26 November. She was replaced by Athabaskan. Iroquois returned to Halifax on 8 January 1953.|$|E

[...] In the same month, Maltese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Tonio Borg visited Australia for discussions with Australian foreign minister Stephen Smith, where the commercial relationship between the two countries were discussed, in particular the signing of a contract between a Perth-based shipbuilding company and the Maltese armed forces for the construction and delivery of four <b>inshore</b> Austal-class <b>patrol</b> craft.|$|R
50|$|Don Juan de Austria was recommissioned on 6 April 1917, {{and left}} Detroit on 17 July 1917 for Newport, Rhode Island, {{arriving}} there on 6 August 1917.

50|$|As {{a part of}} the new {{full-time}} {{staff in}} the First Naval District, Boston, in 1918, Deyo taught destroyer seamanship. He was assigned the year after Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves, then Commander, Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet, became Commander of United States Convoy Operations in the Atlantic in addition to his other duties. He was next transferred to the troopship â€˜â€™Northern Pacificâ€™â€™ as a part of its regular USN officer complement. World War I movement of a million men and their supplies was unprecedented. The crews of harbor and pilot boats, <b>inshore</b> scouts and <b>patrol</b> craft, new merchantmen, escorting vessels, all required training.

5|$|The Action of 30 June 1798 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} fought {{along the}} Biscay coast of France during the French Revolutionary Wars. The French Navy had been largely driven from the Atlantic Ocean early in the war following heavy losses {{in a series of}} failed operations. This had allowed the Royal Navy's Channel Fleet to institute a close blockade on the French naval ports of the Biscay coast, particularly Brest in Brittany. The blockade strategy included a constantly <b>patrolling</b> <b>inshore</b> squadron composed of frigates, tasked with preventing the passage of French ships into or out of the port. In the spring of 1798, several French frigates stationed in the Indian Ocean were sent back to France as the base at ÃŽle de France could no longer supply them effectively. One of these ships was the 40-gun frigate Seine, which departed Port Louis laden with 280 soldiers from the garrison.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} part of the Cold War (late 1940s to late 1950s), {{elements}} of one of the three major task forces that then made up the navy's front line strength, including cruisers and destroyers, were based out of Gotland's various anchorages and harbours. This was in addition to locally based elements of the Coastal Artillery's significant support fleet, which included coastal minelayers, <b>inshore</b> minesweepers, and <b>patrol</b> craft. However, in 1958, a doctrinal switch from heavier surface combatants to smaller ASW combatants (increasingly corvette sized and smaller) and Fast Attack Craft began with most of the former being retired without replacement. The operations of these new combatants were still coordinated with submarines though, which, along with the fact that some major combatants weren't immediately retired (e.g. the two Halland-class destroyers), ironically helped to disguise the problems with relying so heavily on light combatants in the short term. In the late 1960s, this shift towards lighter types accelerated, though more for political and economic reasons than military.|$|R
50|$|Cameroon's Marine Nationale RÃ©publique modernised and {{increased}} its capabilities during 2000 with {{the acquisition of}} a number of small Rodman patrol craft and the retirement of some small older craft. A number of small patrol boats have been acquired or ordered from France. Latest estimates indicate naval strength consists of two combat patrol vessels, three coastal patrol vessels and approximately 30 smaller <b>inshore</b> and river <b>patrol</b> craft allocated to both the navy and the local gendarmerie. These include two 135 tonne Yunnan-class landing craft, which are able to carry and launch smaller craft for troop insertions. Some effort has been made to assess equipment needs to bring L'Audacieux P103 and Bakassi P104 to an effective combat status. This has resulted in weapons capabilities being reduced in favour of an increase in serviceability and the service is now effectively without missile attack capabilities. Bakassi (a Type P 48S missile patrol craft) completed a major refit at Lorient, France in August 1999. This included removing the Exocet missile system and EW equipment, and fitting a funnel aft of the mainmast to replace the waterline exhausts. New radars were also installed. Bakassi is now armed only with 40 mm cannon. Although the Bizerte (P48 large patrol craft) class L'Audacieux is fitted for SS-12M missiles these are not embarked and its operational status is in some doubt, having not been reported at sea since 1995. The Quartier-MaÃ®tre Alfred Moto patrol boat was listed as out of service in 1991 but has since been reactivated.|$|R
