5000|$|From 1946 to 1951 the 7JP4 was {{a common}} CRT (Picture Tube or Kinescope) used in lower priced {{televisions}} sold in the United States. These television were popular for portable carry around and small table top sets. These smaller sets were direct view electrostatic deflection designs. This required an extremely large amount of voltage to produce an image across the full display screen. In 1946, RCA influenced manufacturers (with royalty free circuit designs) to move toward <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> type televisions. <b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> uses varying magnetic fields to produce a full screen image. Horizontal and vertical electromagnets are placed at the picture tube neck, called the [...] "yoke". This method allowed the image to be viewed on larger screens. The first heavily mass-produced large picture tube to use this newer method of deflection was RCA's 10BP4, introduced in 1946. Soon after electrostatic picture tubes and the television electronic design would be completely replaced.|$|E

They produced their first mass spectrometer in 1963, and their first scanning electron microscope in 1966. In 1968 they produced the first amino acid analyzer in the world, the JLC-5AH. [...] The company also continued to develop its line of electron microscopes. The JEM-7, in 1964, was the first electronic microscope to include a mechanism for the electrical adjustment of the lens axis. The JEM-100B incorporated an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> unit {{as well as an}} electromagnetic stigmator. The first photomicrograph of atomic arrangement in the world was taken by a JEOL electron microscope, in 1976.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the design, calibration, {{and performance of}} surface forces apparatus with the capability of illumination of the contact interface for spectroscopic investigation using optical techniques. The apparatus can {{be placed in the}} path of a Nd-YAG laser for studies of the linear response or the second harmonic and sum-frequency generation from a material confined between the two surfaces. In addition to the standard fringes of equal chromatic order technique, which we have digitized for accurate and fast analysis, the distance of separation can be measured with a fiber-optic interferometer during spectroscopic measurements (2 Å resolution and 10 ms response time). The sample approach is accomplished through application of a motor drive, piezoelectric actuator, or <b>electromagnetic</b> lever <b>deflection</b> for variable degrees of range, sensitivity, and response time. To demonstrate the operation of the instrument, the stepwise expulsion of discrete layers of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane from the contact is shown. Lateral forces may also be studied by using piezoelectric bimorphs to induce and direct the motion of one surface...|$|R
5000|$|The Lorentz force acts on any charged {{particle}} in an <b>electromagnetic</b> field. Electrostatic <b>deflection</b> uses a special, simplified {{case of this}} general effect by limiting the field to an electric field. An electric field applies a force on a particle that {{is proportional to the}} strength of the field and to the charge on the particle. The direction of the applied force {{is the same as the}} direction of the electric field. For electrostatic deflection, the applied electric field is arranged so that it lies in the plane perpendicular to the initial direction of the stream. The particles are accelerated by this force in proportion to the charge of the particles. The path the particles follow depends on their sideways acceleration and their velocity when they enter the deflecting field. Therefore it is important for good control of the direction that the particles in the stream have a uniform charge to mass ratio and that they move at a uniform speed.|$|R
40|$|Measurement of {{gas density}} and {{viscosity}} was conducted using a micro-cantilever beam. In parallel, {{the validity of}} the proposed modeling approach was evaluated. This study also aimed to widen the database of the gases on which the model development of the micro-cantilever beams is based. The density and viscosity of gases are orders of magnitude lower than liquids. For this reason, the use of a very sensitive sensor is essential. In this study, a micro-cantilever beam from the field of atomic force microscopy was used. Although the current cantilever was designed to work with thermal activation, in the current investigation, it was activated with an <b>electromagnetic</b> force. The <b>deflection</b> of the cantilever beam was detected by an integrated piezo-resistive sensor. Six pure gases and sixteen mixtures of them in ambient conditions were investigated. The outcome of the investigation showed that the current cantilever beam had a sensitivity of 240 Hz/(kg/m 3), while the accuracy of the determined gas density and viscosity in ambient conditions reached ± 1. 5 % and ± 2. 0 %, respectively...|$|R
50|$|Ballistic Transistors are {{electronic}} devices currently being developed for high-speed integrated circuits, {{which is a}} set of circuits bounded on semiconductor material. They use electromagnetic forces instead of a logic gate, a device used to perform solely on specified inputs, to switch the forces of electrons. The unique design of this transistor includes individual electrons bouncing off of wedge-shaped obstacles called deflectors. Initially impelled by the circuits electric field, electrons proceed on their respective paths via this <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>deflection.</b> Electrons are then able to travel without being scattered by atoms or defects thus producing an increased transit time. With an increased transit time, the ballistic transistor will be able to produce longer and more effective results than the standard transistor today.|$|E
50|$|In {{conventional}} CT machines, an X-ray {{tube and}} detector are physically rotated behind a circular shroud (see the image above right). An alternative, short lived design, known as electron beam tomography (EBT), used <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> of an electron beam {{within a very}} large conical X-ray tube and a stationary array of detectors to achieve very high temporal resolution, for imaging of rapidly moving structures, for example the coronary arteries. Cone-beam CT functionality is also an increasingly common function found in medical fluoroscopy equipment; by rotating the fluoroscope around the patient, a geometry similar to CT can be obtained, and by treating the 2D X-ray detector {{in a manner similar}} to a CT detector with a massive number of rows, it is possible to reconstruct a 3D volume from a single rotation using suitable software.|$|E
50|$|Between the {{electron}} gun {{and the screen}} are two opposed pairs of metal plates called the deflection plates. The vertical amplifier generates a potential difference across one pair of plates, giving rise to a vertical electric field through which {{the electron}} beam passes. When the plate potentials are the same, the beam is not deflected. When the top plate is positive {{with respect to the}} bottom plate, the beam is deflected upwards; when the field is reversed, the beam is deflected downwards. The horizontal amplifier does a similar job with the other pair of deflection plates, causing the beam to move left or right. This deflection system is called electrostatic deflection, and is different from the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> system used in television tubes. In comparison to magnetic deflection, electrostatic deflection can more readily follow random and fast changes in potential, but is limited to small deflection angles.|$|E
40|$|A {{low energy}} neutral atomic oxygen beam system was {{designed}} and is currently being assembled at the Lewis Research Center. The system utilizes a 15 cm diameter Kaufman ion source to produce positive oxygen ions which are charge exchange neutralized to produce low energy (variable from 5 to 150 eV) oxygen atoms at a flux simulating real time low Earth orbital conditions. An electromagnet is used to direct only the singly charged oxygen ions from the ion source into the charge exchange cell. A retarding potential grid is used {{to slow down the}} oxygen ions to desired energies prior to their charge exchange. Cryogenically cooled diatomic oxygen gas in the charge exchange cell is then used to transfer charge to the oxygen ions to produce a neutral atomic oxygen beam. Remaining non-charge exchanged oxygen ions are then swept from the beam by <b>electromagnetic</b> or electrostatic <b>deflection</b> depending upon the desired experiment configuration. The resulting neutral oxygen beam of 5 to 10 cm in diameter impinges upon target materials within a sample holder fixture that can also provide for simultaneous heating and UV exposure during the atomic oxygen bombardment...|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{components}} of a typical electron-beam processing device are illustrated in the figure. An electron gun (consisting of a cathode, grid, and anode) is used to generate and accelerate the primary beam. A magnetic optical (focusing and deflection) system is used for controlling {{the way in which}} the electron beam impinges on the material being processed (the [...] "workpiece"). In operation, the gun cathode is the source of thermally emitted electrons that are both accelerated and shaped into a collimated beam by the electrostatic field geometry established by the gun electrode (grid and anode) configuration used. The electron beam then emerges from the gun assembly through an exit hole in the ground-plane anode with an energy equal to the value of the negative high voltage (gun operating voltage) being applied to the cathode. This use of a direct high voltage to produce a high-energy electron beam allows the conversion of input electrical power to beam power at greater than 95% efficiency, making electron-beam material processing a highly energy-efficient technique. After exiting the gun, the beam passes through an <b>electromagnetic</b> lens and <b>deflection</b> coil system. The lens is used for producing either a focused or defocused beam spot on the workpiece, while the deflection coil is used to either position the beam spot on a stationary location or provide some form of oscillatory motion.|$|R

We first show the limitation to the linear characteristics of input-output response and the response time under the saturation condition in this system. We try to improve the frequency-characteristics of the amplifier by making the load resistance constant and the feedback-paths partially positive, and reduce the L/R value of the load circuit by adopting the mutually-coupled yokecoils and the low-current amplifier.

40|$|A {{sensor system}} which {{provides}} registered high-solution multispectral images {{from a single}} sensor with no mechanical moving parts is reported, and the operation of an image dissector camera (IDC) is described. An earth scene 100 nautical miles wide is imaged through a single lens onto a photocathode surface containing three spectral filters, thereby producing three separate spectral signatures on the photocathode surface. An electron image is formed, accelerated, focused, and electromagnetically, deflected across an image plane which contains three sampling apertures, behind which are located three electron multipliers.

40|$|Acceleration using {{centrifugal}} relays is {{a recently}} discovered method for {{the acceleration of}} spaceborne payloads to high velocity at high thrust. Centrifugal relays are moving rotors which progressively accelerate reaction mass to higher velocities. One important engineering problem consists of accurately tracking {{the position of the}} projectiles and rotors and guiding each projectile exactly onto the appropriate guide tracks on each rotor. The topics of this research are the system kinematics and dynamics and the computerized guidance system which will allow the projectile to approach each rotor with exact timing with respect to the rotor rotation period and with very small errors in lateral positions. Kinematics studies include analysis of rotor and projectile positions versus time and projectile/rotor interactions. Guidance studies include {{a detailed description of the}} tracking mechanism (interrupt of optical beams) and the aiming mechanism (electromagnetic focusing) including the design of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> coils and the switching circuitry...|$|E
40|$|A {{particle}} accelerator is any device that, using electromagnetic fields, {{is able to}} communicate energy to charged particles (typically electrons or ionized atoms), accelerating and/or energizing {{them up to the}} required level for its purpose. The applications of {{particle accelerator}}s are countless, beginning in a common TV CRT, passing through medical X-ray devices, and ending in large ion colliders utilized to find the smallest details of the matter. Among the other engineering applications, the ion implantation devices to obtain better semiconductors and materials of amazing properties are included. Materials supporting irradiation for future nuclear fusion plants are also benefited from particle accelerators. There are many devices in a particle accelerator required for its correct operation. The most important are the particle sources, the guiding, focalizing and correcting magnets, the radiofrequency accelerating cavities, the fast deflection devices, the beam diagnostic mechanisms and the particle detectors. Most of the fast particle deflection devices have been built historically by using copper coils and ferrite cores which could effectuate a relatively fast magnetic deflection, but needed large voltages and currents to counteract the high coil inductance in a response in the microseconds range. Various beam stability considerations and the new range of energies and sizes of present time accelerators and their rings require new devices featuring an improved wakefield behaviour and faster response (in the nanoseconds range). This can only be achieved by an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> device based on a transmission line. The <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> device (strip-line kicker) produces a transverse displacement on the particle beam travelling close to the speed of light, in order to extract the particles to another experiment or to inject them into a different accelerator. The deflection is carried out by the means of two short, opposite phase pulses. The diversion of the particles is exerted by the integrated Lorentz force of the electromagnetic field travelling along the kicker. This Thesis deals with a detailed calculation, manufacturing and test methodology for strip-line kicker devices. The methodology is then applied to two real cases which are fully designed, built, tested and finally installed in the CTF 3 accelerator facility at CERN (Geneva). Analytical and numerical calculations, both in 2 D and 3 D, are detailed starting from the basic specifications in order to obtain a conceptual design. Time domain and frequency domain calculations are developed in the process using different FDM and FEM codes. The following concepts among others are analyzed: scattering parameters, resonating high order modes, the wakefields, etc. Several contributions are presented in the calculation process dealing specifically with strip-line kicker devices fed by electromagnetic pulses. Materials and components typically used for the fabrication of these devices are analyzed in the manufacturing section. Mechanical supports and connexions of electrodes are also detailed, presenting some interesting contributions on these concepts. The electromagnetic and vacuum tests are then analyzed. These tests are required to ensure that the manufactured devices fulfil the specifications. Finally, and only from the analytical point of view, the strip-line kickers are studied together with a pulsed power supply based on solid state power switches (MOSFETs). The solid state technology applied to pulsed power supplies is introduced and several circuit topologies are modelled and simulated to obtain fast and good flat-top pulses...|$|E
40|$|Electron-beam {{lithography}} {{is capable}} of high-resolution lithographic pattern generation (down to 10 nm or below). However, for conventional e-beam lithography, pattern-placement accuracy is inferior to resolution. Despite significant efforts to improve pattern placement, a limit is being approached. The placement capability of conventional e-beam tools is insufficient to fabricate narrow-band optical filters and lasers, which require sub-micrometer-pitch gratings {{with a high degree}} of spatial coherence. Moreover, it is widely recognized that placement accuracy will not be sufficient for future semiconductor device generations, with minimum feature sizes below 100 nm. In electron-beam lithography, an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> system is used in conjunction with a laser-interferometer-controlled stage to generate high-resolution patterns over large areas. Placement errors arise because the laser interferometer monitors the stage position, but the e-beam can independently drift relative to the stage. Moreover, the laser interferometer can itself drift during exposure. To overcome this fundamental limitation, the method of spatial phase-locked electron-beam lithography has been proposed. The beam position is referenced to a high-fidelity grid, exposed by interference lithography, on the substrate surface. In this method, pattern-placement performance depends upon the accuracy of the reference grid and the precision with which patterns can be locked to the grid. The grid must be well characterized to serve as a reliable fiducial. This document describes work done to characterize grids generated by interference lithography. A theoretical model was developed to describe the spatial-phase progression of interferometric gratings and grids. The accuracy of the interference lithography apparatus was found to be limited by substrate mounting errors and uncertainty in setting the geometrical parameters that determine the angle of interference. Experimental measurements were performed, which agreed well with the theoretical predictions. A segmented-grid spatial-phase locking system was implemented on a vector-scan e-beam tool to correct field placement errors, in order to fabricate high-quality Bragg reflectors for optical filters and distributed-feedback lasers. Before this work, Bragg reflectors of adequate fidelity had not been fabricated by e-beam lithography. The phase coherence of the gratings fabricated with the segmented-grid method was characterized by measuring the displacement between adjacent fields. From these measurements, field-placement errors of ~ 20 nm (mean + 3 sigma) were estimated. The segmented grid method was used to pattern Bragg gratings, which were used in the fabrication of integrated optical filters. The devices demonstrated excellent performance. by Juan Ferrera.
