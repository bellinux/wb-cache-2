50|$|The {{population}} of the wood duck was in serious decline in the late 19th century {{as a result of}} severe habitat loss and market hunting both for meat and plumage for the ladies' hat market in Europe. By the beginning of the 20th century, wood ducks had virtually disappeared from much of their former range. In response to the Migratory Bird Treaty established in 1916 and enactment of the U.S. Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, wood duck populations began to recover slowly. By ending unregulated hunting and taking measures to protect remaining habitat, wood duck populations began to rebound in the 1920s. The development of the artificial nesting box in the 1930s gave an additional boost to wood <b>duck</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E

Alexander Fridge, George and William Morris founded the Thistle {{manufacturing}} Company in 1824 with the purchase of the property from the Ellicott brothers. The Ellicott's stipulated that the new factory as well as the Dismal Mill downstream would not operate as a competing flour mill, and in turn, the Ellicott's could not sell liquor on their land, Ellicott's Mills. In 1825 Fridge had sold his assets and the Morris brothers petitioned to build a road from the Thistle factory to the turnpike followed in 1832 with a state appropriation of $600 to build a bridge across the Patapsco at Thistle Mills. In 1837 they built a cotton mill and silk production facility on property purchased from the Ellicott brothers. The 100 employee mill building was built of locally quarried stone along with at least five stone buildings to support laborers and a general store. The company expanded production with the purchase of the Ilchester flour mill in 1882, but lost the facility in receivership in 1892. In 1895, the current owner and operator of the mill W.H. Kerr drowned when attempting to rescue his son who fell off his yacht in Annapolis. In 1919 Edward A.A.

50|$|Long Lake Wetland Management District {{encompasses}} three {{counties in}} south-central North Dakota, an area famed for its wealth of waterfowl-producing potholes and native prairie grasslands. Headquarters for the Wetland Management District {{is located in}} the Long Lake National Wildlife Refuge office near Moffit, North Dakota, which is about 35 miles southeast of Bismarck. Topographical landforms of the area include Missouri Coteau and Missouri River Slope. Precipitation averages just under 16 inches per year. Approximately 68 percent of the land in the three county area remains virgin sod - native mixed-grass prairie. The dominant land use is cattle grazing. The Coteau wetlands found in the northeastern portion of the Wetland Management District are classic prairie potholes of various sizes and types that are prime <b>duck</b> <b>production</b> habitat. These areas, when wet, are very productive. Soils in this area are generally deep and quite productive. Due to the rolling nature of the landscape on the Coteau, a lot of the land is also characterized as highly erodible. Conversely, many of the wetlands on Missouri River Slope portion of the Wetland Management District are large semi-permanent and permanent alkali wetlands. There are 21 wetland sites on the Missouri River Slope that have a history of periodic avian botulism outbreaks. These areas occasionally present localized problems for significant numbers of migratory birds. Soils on the Missouri River Slope are characteristically shallow with high proportions of sand and gravel. Much of the land is highly erodible. Since 1985, substantial land acreage in the three county area that was once farmed has been retired to Conservation Reserve Program grasslands. The program has assisted in restoring waterfowl populations for many species in the Wetland Management District which exceed the highest level ever recorded since surveys began.|$|E

The WPAs are administered by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS); increased <b>duck</b> <b>production</b> is a major management objective. Duck recruitment rates {{in much of the}} four-state area are very low because of high predation, especially on nests.

Public trapping and hunting are permitted on nearly all WPAs. Habitat management is widely practiced but has had limited impact on predation rates. Other predator management activities include limited or experimental use of selective predator control, nesting structures, artificial islands, and electric fences. There is growing demand for cost-effective and acceptable methods to reduce predation, but the number, size, and arrangement of WPAs pose difficult management problems...|$|E

40|$|Presence of ducks, and in {{particular}} of free-grazing ducks, has consistently {{been shown to be}} one of the most important risk factors for highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks which has compromised poultry production in South-East Asia since the early 2000 s and continues to threaten public health, farmers' livelihood and food security. Although free-grazing <b>duck</b> <b>production</b> has been practised for decades in South-East Asia, there are few published studies describing this production system, which is suspected to play an important role in the maintenance of avian influenza viruses. This study aimed at describing quantitatively the long-distance free-grazing <b>duck</b> <b>production</b> system in South Vietnam, characterising the movement and contact patterns of the duck flocks, and identifying potential associations between farming practices, movement and contact patterns and the circulation of avian influenza viruses. We conducted interviews among stakeholders involved in the free-grazing <b>duck</b> <b>production</b> system (duck farmers, transporters and rice paddy owners) in combination with a virological cross-sectional survey in South Vietnam. Results show that both direct and indirect contacts between free-grazing duck flocks were frequent and diverse. The flocks were transported extensively across district and province boundaries, mainly by boat but also by truck or on foot. A third of the investigated flocks had a positive influenza A virology test, indicating current circulation of avian influenza viruses, but none were positive for H 5 subtypes. The age and size of the flock as well as its location at the time of sampling were associated with the risk of influenza A circulation in the flocks. These findings should be considered when developing risk assessment models of influenza virus spread aimed at informing the development of improved biosecurity practices leading to enhanced animal health, sustainable animal production and reliable income for farmers...|$|E
40|$|A cross {{sectional}} survey of <b>duck</b> <b>production</b> {{was carried out}} in 2002 on 771 traditional, semiscavenging household duck farms on the coastal Island of Hatia. We determined the socioeconomic characteristics of duck farmers and their management systems, identified the factors associated with egg production, and measured the level of selected duck diseases and current preventive strategies. Household family size varied from 1 to 14 individuals and women were the main caretakers of ducks. Around 34 % of keepers were illiterate. Most duck products (eggs and meat; 85 %) were sold at the local market. Duck houses were poorly ventilated and a variety of bedding materials were used. Feed was available in nearby scavenging areas; however, additional feed was frequently supplied by farmers. Almost all farmers (96 %) ranked the rainy season as the best time for rearing ducks due to greater feed availability. The annual egg production was 79 eggs per layer with a weight of 48 g and a hatchability rate of 87 %. Egg production varied by zone (p[*] 22 weeks (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract: For decades, {{southern}} China {{has been}} {{considered to be an}} important source for emerging influenza viruses since key hosts live together in high densities in areas with intensive agriculture. However, the underlying conditions of emergence and spread of avian influenza viruses (AIV) have not been studied in detail, particularly the complex spatiotemporal interplay of viral transmission between wild and domestic ducks, two major actors of AIV epidemi-ology. In this synthesis, we examine the risks of avian influenza spread in Poyang Lake, an area of intensive free-ranging <b>duck</b> <b>production</b> and large numbers of wild waterfowl. Our synthesis shows that farming of free-grazing domestic ducks is intensive in this area and synchronized with wild duck migration. The presence of juvenile domestic ducks i...|$|E
40|$|Increased <b>duck</b> <b>production</b> is {{a primary}} goal of {{management}} on federal Waterfowl Production Areas and many National Wildlife Refuges in the glaciated Prairie Pothole Region. Considerable effort is expended to manage many of those areas for increased duck nesting success. Predation often reduces the effectiveness of many waterfowl management practices and results in lowered production of young by local waterfowl populations. Recent studies on upland nesting ducks in the Prairie Pothole Region of North and South Dakota show that up to 18 percent of the nesting hens, 20 - 90 percent of the eggs, and a significant though undetermined number of ducklings are destroyed annually by predators. There is evidence that predation has increased {{in recent years as}} a result of changes in land use practices and predator populations...|$|E
