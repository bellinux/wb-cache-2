The economic factors, which are described through the supply and demand chain, are important for understanding the rate and direction of the progresses of technological change. The state determines the supply, based on the relevant scientific and technological knowledge and opportunity. As well, the state assesses the costs and availability of resources, such as the trained technicians and experienced workers that are involved in the research processes to create and improve climate change adaptation technologies. Whereas, the demand for innovation depends on the amount of cost reduction from the particular technology being used, as well as the consumer and producer benefit from a new or improved technology for <b>existing</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|E

The primary aim of the company was initially the preservation of the <b>existing</b> <b>goods</b> traffic from the kaolin mine in Kemmlitz. For that purpose, second-hand, narrow gauge, goods wagons were bought from the Mansfeld mining railway and a new transshipment site to the standard gauge railway network was built in Oschatz.

In spite of this, the demand gradually fell so that goods services had to be closed in 2001. The Döllnitzbahn was the last narrow gauge railway in Saxony to run public freight services.|$|E

50|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of consumer goods during post World War II only increased <b>existing</b> <b>goods</b> in the market through amassed innovation, creating another major shifts in branding, which is more focused on superior features, unique ingredients and functional benefits.

Barratt - known to be the “Father of Modern Advertising” - always looked {{for new ways to}} endorse the product. Barratt used different techniques of creative advertising that would help the soap product appeal to the mass. Barratt used a series of themed posters using imagery and catchphrases to associate the brand with quality and luxury. The series has a reoccurring theme and one of the posters used an iconic painting by John Everett Millais entitled “Bubbles”. The painting was inspired by Millais’ grandson and it was illustrated out of his delight for the child. The painting portrays pure innocence as Millais took the opportunity to paint his grandson because of how exquisite he looked while holding the pipe to make bubbles. Barratt then used the painting’s meaning {{to be part of the}} Pears Soap message. The soap was added on the foreground pertaining that well-groomed middle-class children could enjoy domestic comforts and have aspirations of high society.|$|E
5000|$|Chapeltown Central {{railway station}} was {{situated}} on the former South Yorkshire Railway's Blackburn Valley line between Ecclesfield East and Westwood.

It also served the works of Newton, Chambers & Company, {{one of the largest}} industrial companies in the area.The original station which was mainly constructed of wood opened in 1854. The line at the time was only a single track and this was increasingly recognised as a bottle neck so plans were made to double this which began in 1875 and a new larger station was to be built {{on the north side of}} the track. The new station was built in the M.S.& L.R.'s Double Pavilion style and the building consisted of a station master's house, booking office, goods office, and first, second and third class waiting rooms. In order to make room for this an <b>existing</b> <b>goods</b> warehouse was demolished. The short single line platform was replaced by a double (up and down line) platform, an iron footbridge was constructed linking the two platforms and a new approach road built from the Sheffield-Barnsley turnpike road. The newly built station was officially opened to passengers on the 5th November 1877.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} simple {{quantitative}} model of Schumpeterian economic dynamics. New {{goods and services}} are endogenously produced through combinations of <b>existing</b> <b>goods.</b> As soon as new goods enter the market they may compete against already <b>existing</b> <b>goods,</b> in other words new products can have destructive effects on <b>existing</b> <b>goods.</b> As {{a result of this}} competition mechanism <b>existing</b> <b>goods</b> may be driven out from the market - often causing cascades of secondary defects (Schumpeterian gales of destruction). The model leads to a generic dynamics characterized by phases of relative economic stability followed by phases of massive restructuring of markets - which could be interpreted as Schumpeterian business `cycles'. Model timeseries of product diversity and productivity reproduce several stylized facts of economics timeseries on long timescales such as GDP or business failures, including non-Gaussian fat tailed distributions, volatility clustering etc. The model is phrased in an open, non-equilibrium setup which can be understood as a self organized critical system. Its diversity dynamics can be understood by the time-varying topology of the active production networks. ...|$|E
