40|$|This article {{examines}} the absence of biological relatedness in couples where {{the use of a}} third-party gamete donor casts doubt on the notion of conven-tional kinship. The authors observe that individuals who have used technol-ogy to create a family remediate relatedness through a dehistoricized idea of kinship in which the traditional concept is replaced with the concept of chance. The article also examines how inherited value is replaced by strate-gies that redefine the ways in which <b>donor</b> <b>gamete</b> parents can pass their val-ues on to their children. This examination is accomplished by looking at how couples who used donated gametes articulate the ways in which familial relatedness is left open to chance...|$|E

Participation in the registry would be mandatory for anyone involved in supplying donor gametes.

40|$|Taking {{into account}} a recent decree {{enacted by the}} Catalan {{government}} stipulating the procedure to provide information on a persons biological roots, {{this article examines the}} tension between the anonymity of the gamete donor and the childs right to know their origin. The analysis of legal systems that recognise this right for children conceived through donated gametes spurs us to further examine the hypotheses, quite widespread today, which consider traditional arguments for secrecy outdated. In this regard, the article also challenges the different treatment granted to adopted children and <b>donor</b> <b>gamete</b> children by legal systems such as Spains. Beyond the possible conflicting rights of children, donors and parents, arguments provided by anonymity supporters, such as the moral damage resulting from disclosure or the possible link between disclosure and a {{decrease in the number of}} donors, should be also taken into account. However, these arguments require absolute empirical evidence, which is not currently conclusive. Alternatively, disclosure of the donors identity is consistent with the needs of donor families and with a major trend in family law supporting the right to know ones genetic origin, dissociated from biological and legal parentage...|$|E
40|$|A new {{paradigm}} {{to collect and}} allocate <b>donor</b> <b>gametes</b> is proposed. In the system, called indirect mirror exchange, the partner {{of the person who}} needs <b>donor</b> <b>gametes,</b> donates in exchange for bonus points that are awarded to the infer-tile person. All candidate recipients of <b>donor</b> <b>gametes</b> are ranked on a waiting list and receive points according to waiting time, medical urgency, phenotypic resemblance and contribution. According to the principle of fairness, per-sons who benefit from a system are obliged to contribute their share. However, strict reciprocity is rejected as unfair. A contribution by the couple is thus not a necessary condition for access to the waiting list. The system of reciprocity is adjusted by taking account of need considerations. The number of bonus points awarded to contributors should be high enough to move them to the front section of the waiting list.

40|$|Much of {{the public}} debate {{surrounding}} new technologies and techniques in assisted reproductive technology (ART) is {{caught up in the}} speculative nature of imagined futures of 'science-fictive' proportions. This thesis, by contrast, examines a 'naturalized' ART donor insemination, discussing the manner in which couples (and occasionally single women) construct distributive and kinship networks as they move through the processes of fertility treatment and the selection of donor sperm. This thesis follows a marketing trail for sperm from scientific journal, to the web, to conference floor. In doing so it examines and contrasts the information that is offered by companies distributing donor sperm and drawn upon by those making selective choices. It argues that the process of <b>donor</b> <b>gamete</b> selection [...] -as mediated by Internet technologies [...] -is characterized by a juxtapositioning of two trends: 'eugenic' promise, and expansion kinship networks based on 'like kinds'. This paper strives to explore these desires, beliefs and motivations at play in the commodification, distribution and consumption observed in the online marketing and sale of gametes. This thesis contributes to the body of anthropological theorizing on gifting and commodification, and kinship, by arguing that donor sperm [...] -in the context of current exchange practices [...] -challenges a dichotomous categorization of gift/commodity, and is best understood as a hybrid item of exchange. Following Appadurai, the commodity candidacy of donor sperm, and the context of its commodification is explored, noting the manner in which kinship networks are extended and negotiated in the process...|$|E
40|$|This review {{addresses}} {{research on}} gamete donors, recipients, and offspring and {{demonstrates that the}} foci on all three within the triad are largely directed at disclosure or anonymity; and each in turn centers on the perceived importance of the genetic link. The importance attached to genetics has led some countries to review the ethics of anonymous gamete donation (e. g. New Zealand’s ‘open system ’ of information sharing) and has led other countries (Sweden, Austria, Victoria, Australia; the Netherlands, the UK) to change their laws allowing <b>donor</b> <b>gamete</b> offspring the right to obtain identifying information about their genetic parent. This review demonstrates that genealogical inconsistencies between and within members of the triad are common regardless of legislation. A discussion of future trends and concerns, relating {{to the use of}} gamete donation and the effects legislation is likely to have on the donor triads in the UK following 2005, is provided. The review also addresses the importance of testing theoretical models within future research, and argues this would lead {{to a better understanding of}} the underlying problems encountered at a psychosocial level, such as continued preference for ano-nymity in donors and denial in large numbers of users of the involvement of a donor in conception. Lack of disclosure effec-tively prevents true implementation of legislation; if a child is not informed, it is the result of donated gametes, it cannot take up the legally available option of finding out identifiable information about their genetic parent(s).

40|$|Abstract Background Premature ovarian failure (POF) {{remains a}} {{clinically}} challenging entity because {{in vitro fertilisation}} (IVF) with donor oocytes is currently the only treatment known to be effective. Methods A 33 year-old nulligravid patient with a normal karyotype was diagnosed with POF; she {{had a history of}} failed fertility treatments and had an elevated serum FSH (42 mIU/ml). Oocytes donated by her dizygotic twin sister were used for IVF. The donor had already completed a successful pregnancy herself and subsequently produced a total of 10 oocytes after a combined FSH/LH superovulation regime. These eggs were fertilised with sperm from the recipient's husband via intracytoplasmic injection and two fresh embryos were transferred to the recipient on day three. Results A healthy twin pregnancy resulted from IVF; two boys were delivered by caesarean section at 39 weeks' gestation. Additionally, four embryos were cryopreserved for the recipient's future use. The sister-donor achieved another natural pregnancy six months after oocyte retrieval, resulting in a healthy singleton delivery. Conclusion POF is believed to affect approximately 1 % of reproductive age females, and POF patients with a sister who can be an oocyte donor for IVF are rare. Most such IVF patients will conceive from treatment using oocytes from an anonymous oocyte donor. This is the first report of births following sister-donor oocyte IVF in Ireland. Indeed, while sister-donor IVF has been successfully undertaken by IVF units elsewhere, this is the only known case where oocyte donation involved twin sisters. As with all types of <b>donor</b> <b>gamete</b> therapy, pre-treatment counselling is important in the circumstance of sister oocyte donation. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTwo {{important}} explanations {{exist for}} cross-border reproductive care: restrictive legislation {{at home and}} limited access to affordable treatment.

After a decade of legal challenges by patients, the components of Law 40 have now been deemed unconstitutional in Italy. Similarly, a paucity of <b>donor</b> <b>gametes</b> in the UK has left many patients with few options but to seek donors and treatments overseas.

40|$|Abstract Background This {{investigation}} describes {{features of}} patients undergoing {{in vitro fertilisation}} (IVF) and embryo transfer (ET) where both gametes were obtained from anonymous donors. Methods Gamete unsuitability or loss was confirmed in both members of seven otherwise healthy couples presenting for reproductive endocrinology consultation over a 12 -month interval in Ireland. IVF was undertaken with fresh oocytes provided by anonymous donors in Ukraine; frozen sperm (anonymous donor) was obtained from a licensed tissue establishment. For recipients, saline-enhanced sonography {{was used to assess}} intrauterine contour with endometrial preparation via transdermal estrogen. Results Among commissioning couples, mean&# 177;SD female and male age was 41. 9 &# 177; 3. 7 and 44. 6 &# 177; 3. 5 yrs, respectively. During this period, female age for non dual anonymous gamete donation IVF patients was 37. 9 &# 177; 3 yrs (p < 0. 001). Infertility duration was &# 8805; 3 yrs for couples enrolling in dual gamete donation, and each had &# 8805; 2 prior failed fertility treatments using native oocytes. All seven recipient couples proceeded to embryo transfer, although one patient had two transfers. Clinical pregnancy was achieved for 5 / 7 (71. 4 %) patients. Non-transferred cryopreserved embryos were available for all seven couples. Conclusions Mean age of females undergoing dual anonymous <b>donor</b> <b>gamete</b> donation with IVF is significantly higher than the background IVF patient population. Even when neither partner is able to contribute any gametes for IVF, the clinical pregnancy rate per transfer can be satisfactory if both anonymous egg and sperm donation are used concurrently.

40|$|Background: Involuntary {{infertility}} is {{a tragedy}} in most African setting. This is due to premium placed on fertility {{as a result of}} roles children fulfill in the family and the society. Aetiologic factors of infertility in sub-Saharan Africa are mostly infection related and they are mainly associated with poor treatment outcome to conventional non assisted conception technique. Objective: To evaluate the level of awareness and perception of assisted conception treatment among women attending fertility clinic. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study. Results: One hundred and ninety six women attending fertility clinic were interviewed. Mean age was 34. 8 year and mean duration of infertility of 4. 1 years. Of the 196 infertile women interviewed, 150 (76. 5 %) have heard of Assisted Reproductive Technology treatment. Sources of information were mainly family relation (46 %) and friends (28. 7 %). Knowledge on some of Assisted Reproductive Technology practices showed that 50. 7 % were aware that the treatment could fail, 36. 8 % knew it could be applied for male infertility treatment, 9. 3 % and 18. 7 % respectively are aware that donor oocyte and sperm could be used for treatment. Perception on babies conceived from assisted conception treatment revealed that 52 % of patients interviewed could not comment if they are normal and natural babies. Majority of patients could not affirm if they will agree to the use of <b>donor</b> <b>gamete</b> or zygote for their treatment. Conclusion: Awareness of assisted conception treatment was high, however knowledge on specifics of treatment was low and perception on some of the practices was unfavorable.

40|$|Objective: To measure Irish {{opinion on}} a range of {{assisted}} human reproduction (AHR) treatments. Methods: A nationally representative sample of Irish adults (n= 1, 003) were anonymously sampled by telephone survey. Results: Most participants (77 %) agreed that any fertility services offered internationally should also be available in Ireland, although only a small minority of the general Irish population had personal familiarity with AHR or infertility. This sample finds substantial agreement (63 %) that the Government of Ireland should introduce legislation covering AHR. The range of support for gamete donation in Ireland ranged from 53 % to 83 %, depending on how donor privacy and disclosure policies are presented. For example, donation where the donor agrees to be con­tacted by the child born following donation, and anonymous donation where donor privacy is completely protected by law were supported by 68 % and 66 %, respectively. The least popular (53 %) <b>donor</b> <b>gamete</b> treatment type appeared to be donation where the donor consents {{to be involved in the}} future life of any child born as a result of donor fertility treatment. Respondents in social class ABC 1 (58 %), age 18 to 24 (62 %), age 25 to 34 (60 %), or without children (61 %) were more likely to favour this donor treatment policy in our sample. Conclusion: This is the first nationwide assessment of Irish public opinion on the advanced reproductive technologies since 2005. Access to a wide range of AHR treatment was supported by all subgroups studied. Public opinion concerning specific types of AHR treatment varied, yet general support for the need for national AHR legislation was reported by 63 % of this national sample. Contemporary views on AHR remain largely consistent with the Commission for Assisted Human Reproduction recommendations from 2005, although further research is needed to clarify exactly how popular opinion on these issues has changed. It appears that legislation allowing for the full range of donation options (and not mandating disclosure of donor identity at a stipulated age) would better align with current Irish public opinion...|$|E

40|$|The {{normative}} folk {{model of}} kinship in the US continues to attach great significance to "blood" relationships. These implicit genetic links are commonly reinforced through observations about a child's physical similarity to parents or other family members, i. e., "resemblance talk". This paper explores {{the meanings of}} resemblance and resemblance talk for parents drawing on semi-structured interviews with 148 heterosexual couples who had used a <b>donor</b> <b>gamete</b> to conceive at least one living child. For parents of children conceived with donor eggs or sperm, resemblance talk represents the ongoing threat that comments about physical appearance could stigmatize their children or {{cast doubt on the}} legitimacy of their family structure. Furthermore, these concerns were present regardless of whether a sperm or egg donor had been used and irrespective of the parents' disclosure decision, i. e., whether or not their children were told of the true nature of their conception. Parents found that resemblance talk was not only ubiquitous, unavoidable, and uncontrollable, but it also had the capacity to exacerbate ongoing uncertainties about their disclosure decision (or lack of one), worries about establishing their child within the extended family, and apprehension that insensitive remarks could make the child feel different from other family members. As a result, many couples spent considerable energy developing a variety of strategies for managing resemblance talk that included genetic plausibility arguments, "passing", and strategic silence. We conclude that parents of children conceived with a donor address and contest normative definitions of kinship and family, including stigma and otherness, resist challenges to the family they have created, and, to some extent, rework their allegiance to cultural norms to suit their own needs. Because resemblance talk and disclosure decisions are frequently tied to each other, it is likely that if the public were more accepting of difference, parents would likely feel more comfortable with disclosure. Yet resemblance talk may {{make it more difficult for}} parents to disclose, not easier, as long as attitudes about the implicit primacy of genetic connectedness prevail.

40|$|STUDY QUESTION: Are {{live birth}} rates (LBRs) after {{artificial}} cycle frozen-thawed embryo transfer (AC-FET) non-inferior to LBRs after modified natural cycle frozen-thawed embryo transfer (mNC-FET) ? SUMMARY ANSWER AC-FET: is non-inferior to mNC-FET {{with regard to}} LBRs, clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates (OPRs) but AC-FET does result in higher cancellation rates. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN: Pooling prior retrospective studies of AC-FET and mNC-FET results in comparable pregnancy and LBRs. However, these results {{have not yet been}} confirmed by a prospective randomized trial. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE AND DURATION: In this non-inferiority prospective randomized controlled trial (acronym ‘ANTARCTICA’ trial), conducted from February 2009 to April 2014, 1032 patients were included of which 959 were available for analysis. The primary outcome of the study was live birth. Secondary outcomes were clinical and ongoing pregnancy, cycle cancellation and endometrium thickness. A cost-efficiency analysis was performed. PARTICIPANT/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: This study was conducted in both secondary and tertiary fertility centres in the Netherlands. Patients included in this study had to be 18 – 40 years old, had to have a regular menstruation cycle between 26 and 35 days and frozen-thawed embryos to be transferred had to derive from one of the first three IVF or IVF–ICSI treatment cycles. Patients with a uterine anomaly, a contraindication for one of the prescribed medications in this study or patients undergoing a <b>donor</b> <b>gamete</b> procedure were excluded from participation. Patients were randomized based on a 1 : 1 allocation to either one cycle of mNC-FET or AC-FET. All embryos were cryopreserved using a slow-freeze technique. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE LBR: after mNC-FET was 11. 5 % (57 / 495) versus 8. 8 % in AC-FET (41 / 464) resulting in an absolute difference in LBR of ? 0. 027 in favour of mNC-FET (95 % confidence interval (CI) ? 0. 065 – 0. 012; P = 0. 171). Clinical pregnancy occurred in 94 / 495 (19. 0 %) patients in mNC-FET versus 75 / 464 (16. 0 %) patients in AC-FET (odds ratio (OR) 0. 8, 95 % CI 0. 6 – 1. 1, P = 0. 25). 57 / 495 (11. 5 %) mNC-FET resulted in ongoing pregnancy versus 45 / 464 (9. 6 %) AC-FET (OR 0. 7, 95 % CI 0. 5 – 1. 1, P = 0. 15). ? 2 test confirmed the lack of superiority. Significantly more cycles were cancelled in AC-FET (124 / 464 versus 101 / 495, OR 1. 4, 95 % CI 1. 1 – 1. 9, P = 0. 02). The costs of each of the endometrial preparation methods were comparable (€ 617. 50 per cycle in NC-FET versus € 625. 73 per cycle in AC-FET, P = 0. 54). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The minimum of 1150 patients required for adequate statistical power was not achieved. Moreover, LBRs were lower than anticipated in the sample size calculation. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS LBRs: after AC-FET were not inferior to those achieved by mNC-FET. No significant differences in clinical and OPR were observed. The costs of both treatment approaches were comparable. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S) : An educational grant was received during the conduct of this study.

40|$|Abstract Preconception care {{to address}} genetic risks in {{reproduction}} may be offered either individually to couples with a known or suspected {{increased risk of}} having {{a child with a}} genetic disorder, or systematically to couples or individuals of reproductive age. The identification of cou-ples at risk of transmitting a (serious) genetic disorder allows those couples to refrain from having children or to adapt their reproductive plans (using prenatal or preimplan-tation diagnosis, <b>donor</b> <b>gametes,</b> or adoption). Ethical issues concern the possible objectives of providing these options through preconception genetic counseling or screening, objections to abortion and embryo-selection, concerns about eugenics and medicalization, and issues arising in the pro-fessional–client relationship and/or {{in the light of the}} nor-mative framework for population screening. Although enhancing reproductive autonomy rather than prevention should be regarded as the primary aim of preconception care for genetic risks, directive counseling may well be acceptable in exceptional cases, and prevention in the sense of avoiding serious suffering may be an appropriate objec-tive of specific community-based preconception screening programmes.

Th is has placed Iran, a Shia-dominant country, {{in a unique position}} vis-à-vis the Sunni Islamic world, where all forms of gamete donation are strictly prohibited. In this article, we first examine the “Iranian ART revolution” that has allowed donor technologies to be admitted as a form of assisted reproduction. Then we examine the response of Iranian women to their infertility and the profound social pressures they face. We argue that the experience of infertility and its treatment are mediated by women’s socioeconomic position within Iranian society. Many women lack economic access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) technologies and fear the moral consequences of gamete donation. Thus, the benefits of the Iranian ART revolution are mixed: although many Iranian women have been able to overcome their infertility through ARTs, not all women’s lives are improved by these technologies...|$|R
40|$|Four Jehovah's Witness couples {{were treated}} between 2000 and 2009 using in vitro {{fertilization}} or intracytoplasmic sperm injection. A review of the issues encountered during their treatment, and the options chosen, was made {{in an attempt to}} provide effective treatment without compromising the moral views of the individuals concerned. Considerations specific to the Jehovah's Witness faith were identified that required departure from the standard operating procedures used in the clinic, and the development of modified protocols prior to treatment is recommended to minimize the stress and anxiety of patients and staff alike. Issues raised included the collection of semen by masturbation, the use of <b>donor</b> <b>gametes,</b> the number of oocytes inseminated, the discard of poor quality embryos conventionally thought unsuitable for transfer or embryo cryopreservation. A common request was the avoidance of blood products as a culture medium supplement. The use of recombinant human albumin circumvented this, although a recent shift by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania in the interpretation of the Bible opens the possibility of using blood fractions if not whole blood, and so the use of standard culture medium containing human serum albumin is now acceptable to some Jehovah's Witnesses...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role played}} by psychology and psychologists in the treatment of infertile people, and focuses especially on issues where <b>donor</b> <b>gametes</b> or embryos are used. Psychology has argued strongly for a “therapeutic injunction” in which people undergoing treatment are urged to talk to others; are advised that it is better to tell a child of the method of his/her conception and of his/her genetic background; and are advised that it is better for donors, recipients, and children to have access to information about one another and to know one another. We question this for several reasons. First, there are no data to support the claim that full disclosure produces better mental and family health than nondisclosure. Second, donors and recipients overwhelmingly prefer information, especially identifying information, to be kept private and confidential. Third, in making this prescription, psychology is “psychologising” a physical problem, assuming psychological problems must exist in infertile people which must be treated. The paper concludes by suggesting that psychology and psychologists have been attempting to reproduce psychology, perhaps at the expense of developing {{a better understanding of the}} psychology of reproduction...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} total costs of {{infertility}} coverage, determine {{the proportion of}} healthcare costs related to infertility, compare infertility costs {{to those of other}} diseases, and calculate a per member per month cost of an infertility benefit. DESIGN: Historical prospective analysis. SETTING: A university-based, self-insured, fee-for-service healthcare plan. PATIENT(S) : Healthcare policy members from January 1993 through December 1995. INTERVENTION(S) : General and infertility-specific healthcare that included diagnostic tests for infertility, induction of ovulation, artificial insemination, <b>donor</b> <b>gametes,</b> in vitro fertilization, gamete intrafallopian transfer, zygote intrafallopian transfer, microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration, embryo cryopreservation, and frozen embryo transfer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Healthcare costs, as calculated from the International Classification of Diseases, Volume 9 codes. RESULT(S) : Total healthcare and infertility-specific costs of the university healthcare plan over a 3 -year period were $ 86, 445, 642 and $ 680, 921, respectively. Therefore, infertility accounted for 0. 79 % of the total university healthcare costs. The mean total and infertility-specific per member per month healthcare costs were $ 86. 15 and $ 0. 67, respectively. CONCLUSION(S) : These data reveal that infertility costs account for {{only a small fraction of}} the total healthcare costs and can be attained at a nominal monthly fee...|$|R
40|$|Should {{children}} conceived {{through the}} use of donated gametes have access to information identifying their donors when they reach maturity? The UK Government is expected soon to decide that, from now on, {{the answer to this question}} is to be 'yes'. But is this a good idea? Even though there are sound reasons for relaxing absolute secrecy in the use of <b>donor</b> <b>gametes,</b> <b>donor</b> identification represents an unnecessary step. And it's a bad idea whether or not identifying donors will lead to a decrease the numbers of people donating gametes. Why do people want to remove anonymity? Those lobbying for its removal give several reasons, such as the right of children to know about their genetic heritage taking priority over donor's rights. Knowledge of genetic parentage is also significant to our sense of personal identity, including our cultural and ethnic ties. Additionally, the importance of openness for the welfare of children dictates a need for identifying information. Against this, supporters of donor anonymity highlight the significance of donors' rights to confidentiality and privacy. Anonymity also ensures donors donate for 'good' reasons anonymous donors are more likely to harbour an altruistic desire to assist people to have children, rather than a narcissistic wish to increase one's genetic offspring. Moreover, allowing or compelling a visible third party's entry into donor insemination (DI) families could lead to disruption and hurt on all sides. Weighing up these competing claims is difficult. Whose rights are paramount? How can the dynamics of each unique family be accounted for? These are thorny issues, but respecting the rights of those involved does not necessarily entail the removal of donor anonymity. However, total secrecy is also unwarranted and so some change to current regulations is justified...|$|R
40|$|The {{status quo}} on parental {{licensing}} in most Western jurisdictions is that licensing {{is required in}} the case of adoption but not {{in the case of}} assisted or unassisted biological reproduction. To have a child via adoption, one must fulfill licensing requirements, which, beyond the usual home study, can include mandatory participation in parenting classes. One is exempt from these requirements, however, if one has a child via biological reproduction, including assisted reproduction involving <b>donor</b> <b>gametes</b> or a contract pregnancy. In an earlier paper, we challenged this system of parental licensing by showing that arguments in favour of it do not succeed. One argument we failed to consider, however, is that prospective biological parents have a right to reproduce that protects them against the sort of state interference that is involved in parental licensing. According to this argument, because prospective adoptive parents do not exercise a similar right when attempting to become parents, they are not similarly protected. In this paper, we argue that this reproductive rights argument, like other arguments in favour of the status quo on parental licensing, is flawed. We also question whether people in fact have a right to reproduce, and in doing so distinguish this right from others that we think are legitimate, including a right to become a parent and a right to bodily autonomy...|$|R
