25|$|Zeth Höglund, {{prisoner}} number 172, {{was released}} from Långholmen prison on 6 May 1917 after more than 13 months in prison. He was greeted by his friends, family {{and a couple of}} thousands workers who had gathered outside the prison. On the same day of his release, Höglund held a speech in a park in Stockholm, massing thousands of people to hear <b>him</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> peace, socialism and revolution.|$|E
25|$|Heine {{was more}} {{interested}} in studying history and literature than law. The university had engaged the famous literary critic and thinker August Wilhelm Schlegel as a lecturer and Heine heard <b>him</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the Nibelungenlied and Romanticism. Though he would later mock Schlegel, Heine found in him a sympathetic critic for his early verses. Heine began to acquire a reputation as a poet at Bonn. He also wrote two tragedies, Almansor and William Ratcliff, but they had little success in the theatre.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, one of Keillor's [...] "Old Scout" [...] columns {{contained}} {{a reference to}} [...] "lousy holiday songs by Jewish guys" [...] and a complaint about [...] "Silent Night" [...] as rewritten by Unitarians, upsetting some readers. A Unitarian minister named Cynthia Landrum responded, [...] "Listening to <b>him</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> us over the years, it's {{becoming more and more}} evident that he isn't laughing with us — he's laughing at us", while Jeff Jacoby of the Boston Globe called Keillor [...] "cranky and intolerant".|$|E
5000|$|Perry {{responded by}} stating that his films were meant as {{entertainment}} {{and should not be}} taken so seriously. Stated Perry, [...] "I am sick of <b>him</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> me. I am sick of him saying, 'This is a coon, this is a buffoon.' I am sick of <b>him</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> black people going to see movies. This is what he said: 'You vote by what you see'—as if black people don't know what they want to see. I am sick of <b>him.</b> He <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> Whoopi, he <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> Oprah, he <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> me, he <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> Clint Eastwood. Spike needs to shut the hell up!" ...|$|R

2500|$|Comey also {{testified that}} Ashcroft [...] "expressed himself in very strong terms." [...] Goldsmith testified that Ashcroft spoke {{at length about}} the legal issue. [...] "Attorney General Ashcroft… [...] a couple of minutes' speech {{in which he said}} that he…. shared the Justice department's concerns." [...] Although he was not present for the {{conversation}} between Gonzales and Ashcroft, FBI Director Bob Mueller testified, [...] "Ashcroft complained to Judge Gonzales about White House compartmentalization rules preventing Ashcroft from getting the advice he needed." [...] On July 24, 2007, Gonzales testified that he and Card were also concerned about Ashcroft's competency. [...] "Obviously there was concern about General Ashcroft's condition. [...] And we would not have sought nor did we intend to get any approval from General Ashcroft if in fact he wasn't fully competent to make the decision." [...] In response to a question from Senator Hatch, Gonzales continued, [...] "Obviously we were concerned about the condition of General Ashcroft. [...] We obviously knew he had been ill and had surgery. [...] And we never had any intent to ask anything of him if we did not feel that he was competent. [...] When we got there, I will just say that Mr. Ashcroft did most of the talking. [...] We were there maybe five minutes – five to six minutes. [...] Mr. Ashcroft talked about the legal issues in a lucid form, as I've heard <b>him</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> legal issues in the White House.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} the facts that Nat King Cole had the #7 song in 1959, and the #1 song in 1921, and Chuck Berry had a major hit with [...] "Maybellene" [...] in 1955, in the United States in the 1950s legal {{segregation}} and discrimination against African Americans was common, especially in the Deep South. Presley would nevertheless publicly cite his debt to African American music, pointing to artists such as B. B. King, Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup, Ivory Joe Hunter, and Fats Domino. The reporter who conducted Presley's first interview in New York City in 1956 noted that he named blues singers who [...] "obviously {{meant a lot to}} him. [...] was very surprised to hear <b>him</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the black performers down there and about how he tried to carry on their music." [...] Later that year in Charlotte, North Carolina, Presley was quoted as saying: [...] "The colored folks been singing it and playing it just like I’m doin' now, man, for more years than I know. They played it like that in their shanties and in their juke joints and nobody paid it no mind 'til I goosed it up. I got it from them. Down in Tupelo, Mississippi, I used to hear old Arthur Crudup bang his box the way I do now and I said if I ever got to a place I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw." [...] Little Richard said of Presley: [...] "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music." [...] B. B. King said he began to respect Presley after he did Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup material and that after he met him, he thought the singer really was something else and was someone whose music was growing all the time right up to his death.|$|E

60|$|It {{made our}} mouths water to hear <b>him</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the things, and we handed {{him out the}} stove and the frying-pan and all the eggs that had not smashed and gone over {{everything}} in the hamper, and begged him to begin.|$|E
60|$|Emily was {{inclined}} to make a serious matter of the accident, but her cousin said ten words while she said one, {{and by the time}} her first sentence was uttered, she found <b>him</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> his ride to Devereux Castle.|$|R
50|$|Curnow was {{the subject}} of the 2001 {{documentary}} Early Days Yet, directed by Shirley Horrocks. Filmed in the final months of Curnow's life, it records <b>him</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> his life and work, and visiting the setting of some of his important poems.|$|R
50|$|The {{song and}} its title {{is said to}} be about dance music, but in later interviews, lead singer Simon Fowler said that it is about the sound of cars outside your window and <b>him</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> how he enjoys living in the country.|$|R

6000|$|Robespierre chatted {{continuously}} as {{the meal}} went on, and Harry asked himself in astonishment {{whether he was}} in a dream, and if this man before <b>him,</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> his birds, his flowers, and his life before he came to Paris, could really be the dreaded Robespierre.

Let's go back, Tom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{seems to}} be up the telegraph-post," [...] said the mother, [...] "investigating the wires, no doubt. I heard <b>him</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> {{telegraphy}} to Madge this morning--retailing what cousin Sam tries to teach him,--and I shouldn't wonder if he were now endeavouring {{to make sure that}} what he told her was correct, for you know he is a thorough investigator." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And natty. He knows a {{thing or}} two for a millionaire that don't have to work, and he runs that place of his right up to the handle.

'Ain't your name Tooting?' he hollered. I almost fell out of the buggy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you hear}} that, gentlemen? Do you hear <b>him</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> bloodshed? So it's blood you want, is it, you ravin' desperado!

60|$|Polly {{could not}} help smiling at Tom's new tone, it seemed so strange to hear <b>him</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> {{anything}} but horses and tailors, dancing and girls.

6000|$|Mrs. Reiver {{had broken}} him {{of talking about}} himself, and made <b>him</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> her own merits.

60|$|Alice made <b>him</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> {{his journey}} {{and he did}} so frankly, except {{that he did not}} mention his meeting the girl in the tea-room or the detective's visit to his hotel. Still he felt a certain embarrassment, as he had done when he told his partner's story. It was rather hard to relate his own exploits, and he knew Alice would note any error he was led into by vanity or false diffidence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, isn't he lovely?" [...] cried Miss Graham. [...] "There, Mrs. Bowen! Mr. Waters's {{manner is}} what I call truly complimentary.
