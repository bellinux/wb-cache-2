Internal state of the processor {{is dominated by the}} L 2 cache. During the process of dumping the cache content, the processor’s execution is halted so that the state can be faithfully reproduced offline. In order to reduce the duration for which the processor is halted, and indirectly reduce debug time, we propose two Online Cache Dumping strategies, Retransmit Non-dumped Line (RNL) and <b>Dump</b> History <b>Table</b> (DHT), with the objective of transferring the cache contents while the processor is executing, and yet maintaining fidelity of the dumped data. For typical experimental debug scenarios, we observe that the effective dump times are reduced to between 0. 01 % and 3. 5 % of the original times.

In this paper, we collect and analyze a variety of data to characterize the penetration of IPv 6. We show that each analysis leads to somewhat different conclusions. For example: registry data shows IPv 6 address allocations are growing rapidly, yet BGP <b>table</b> <b>dumps</b> indicate many addresses are either never announced or announced long after allocation; Netflow records from a tier- 1 ISP show growth in native IPv 6 traffic, but deeper analysis reveals most of the traffic is DNS queries and ICMP packets; a more detailed inspection of tunneled IPv 6 traffic uncovers many packets exchanged between IPv 4 -speaking hosts (e. g., to traverse NAT boxes). Overall, our study suggests that from our vantage points, current IPv 6 deployment appears somewhat experimental, and that the growth of IPv 6 allocations, routing announcements, and traffic volume probably indicate more operators and users preparing themselves for the transition to IPv 6. ...|$|R

40|$|The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover, Curiosity, {{has been}} {{exploring}} sedimentary rocks within Gale crater since landing in August, 2012. On the lower slopes of Aeolis Mons (a. k. a. Mount Sharp), drill powder was collected from a high-silica (74 wt% SiO 2) outcrop named Buckskin (BK). It {{was a surprise}} to find that the Buckskin sample contained significant amounts of the relatively rare silica polymorph tridymite. We describe the setting of the Buckskin sample, the detection of tridymite by the MSL Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) X-ray diffraction instrument, and detection implications. Geologic setting: The Buckskin outcrop is part of the Murray formation exposed in the Marias Pass area. The formation was previously studied by CheMin in the Pahrump Hills member [1] where three samples of drill fines were analyzed (Confidence Hills (CH), Mojave 2 (MJ) and Telegraph Peak (TP) [2]). Assuming approximately horizontal bedding, the Buckskin outcrop is approx. 15 m stratigraphically above the bottom of the Pahrump Hills member. Mudstone, generally characterized by fine lamination, is the dominant depositional facies [1]. Buckskin Mineralogical and Chemical Composition: The CheMin instrument and XRD pattern analysis procedures have been previously discussed [3 - 6]. The diffraction pattern used for quantitative XRD analysis (Fig. 1) is the sum of the first 4 of 45 diffraction images. The remaining images are all characterized by both on-ring and off-ring diffraction spots that we attributed to poor grain motion and particle clumping. Coincident with particle clumping was a significant decrease in the intensity of the tridymite diffraction peaks (Fig. 2 a). The derived mineralogical composition of the crystalline component (derived from the first 4 diffraction images) is given in Table 1. The tridymite is well-crystalline and its pattern is refined as monoclinic tridymite (Fig 1). Mineral chemical compositions were derived from XRD unit cell parameters or obtained from stoichiometry. The XRD-calculated amorphous component was 50 +/- 15 wt%. We constrained the value to 60 wt% because it is the minimum value necessary to give a positive Al 2 O 3 concentration for the amorphous component using APXS data for the post-sieve <b>dump</b> pile (<b>Table</b> 2). The amorphous component has high SiO 2 (approx. 77 wt%) and high anion (SO 3 +P 2 O 5 +Cl ~ 10 wt%) concentrations. Calculation shows that a cation-anion balance is achieved if the cations in the amorphous component except SiO 2 and TiO 2, which do not readily form salts, are assumed to be present as amorphous mixed-cation sulfates, phosphates, and chlorides (or perchlorates/ chlorates) ...|$|R
40|$|How can {{the concept}} of abuse of European Union law - which {{can be defined as}} {{undesirable}} choice of law artificially made by a private citizen - generate so much disagreement among equally intelligent individuals? Seeking to transcend the classical debate between its supporters and adversaries, the present study submits that {{the concept of}} abuse of EU law is located on three major fault-lines of EU law, which accounts for the well-established controversies in the field. The first fault-line, which is common to all legal orders, opposes legal congruence (the tendency to yield equitable legal outcomes) to legal certainty (the tendency to yield predictable legal outcomes). Partisans of legal congruence tend to advocate the prohibition of abuses of law, whereas partisans of legal certainty tend to oppose it. The second fault-line is specific to EU law and divides two conceptions of the regulation of the internal market. If economic integration is conceived as the promotion of cross-border competition among private businesses (the paradigm of 'regulatory neutrality'), choices of law must be proscribed as abusive, for they distort business competition. But if economic integration is intended to promote competition among Member States (the paradigm of 'regulatory competition'), choices of law by EU citizens represent a desirable process of arbitrage among national laws. The third and final fault-line corresponds to the tension between two orientations of the economic constitution of the European Union, namely the fear of private power and the fear of public power. Those who fear private power most tend to endorse the prohibition of abuses of law, whereas those who fear public power most tend to reject it. Seen in this way, the concept of abuse of EU law offers a forum in which fundamental questions about the nature and function of EU law can be confronted and examined in a new light.

40|$|International Workshop Current {{developments}} in remediation of contaminated lands 27 - 29 October 2005, Pulawy, Poland Environmental impact and potential remediation of contaminated land affected by Zn-Pb mining Valérie Cappuyns* 1, Rudy Swennen 1, Patrick Ganne 1, 2 and Marjan Niclaes 1 1 Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Fysico-chemische Geologie, Celestijnenlaan 200 C, B- 3001 Heverlee, Belgium 2 Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Mijnbouw, Kasteelpark Arenberg 40, B- 3001 Heverlee, Belgium 1. Introduction From the Middle Ages until {{the beginning of}} the 20 th century, extensive Zn-Pb mining and smelting was carried out in East-Belgium. By lack of waste treatment techniques and of sustainable management practices, metal-bearing slags and unprocessed waste were dumped. Besides the important amount of waste that is stored in huge mine tailings, the surroundings of the tailings are often contaminated {{as a consequence of the}} dispersal of contaminants by wind erosion, runoff or fluvial transport. In the present study, the distribution pattern, the actual and potential mobilisation and (natural) attenuation of Pb, Zn and Cd in the mine tailings of La Calamine and Angleur (East-Belgium) was investigated. 2. Methodology In La Calamine and Angleur (East-Belgium), vertical profiles were sampled in detail within tailings consisting of respectively dredged mine tailing pond sediments and waste from the metallurgical process of Zn-production. Samples were also taken from overbank sediments along the Geul 7, 9 and 12 km downstream from the mine tailing pond of La Calamine and in the neighbourhood (300 m) of the dump site of Angleur. Total metal concentrations, pH and grainsize were determined for all the samples and a mineralogical (petrography, XRD, SEM-EDX) investigation of tailing material from La Calamine and Angleur was carried out. Porewater extractions and the DIN 38414 -S 4 leaching test (extraction with water at a liquid/solid ratio of 10 / 1) were used to evaluate heavy metal leaching from the tailing material. pHstat leaching tests and geochemical modelling of the pH-dependent leaching behaviour were performed on a selection of samples from both mine tailings. The feasibility of the addition of phosphates as a measure to reduce the release of Pb, Zn and Cd into the environment was also investigated. 3. Results and discussion 3. 1. Mineralogical and physico-chemical characterisation At both locations, mine tailings and soils in the surrounding of the tailings were contaminated with Zn, Pb, Cd and As (Table 1). The mine tailing in La Calamine is located in a rural area with a low population density. The nearby Geul river flows through the mine tailing, resulting in a severe contamination of alluvial soils downstream from the tailing. The area around the mine tailing in Angleur has been urbanised. The main minerals in the La Calamine mine tailing were sfalerite (ZnS), smithsonite (ZnCO 3), anglesite (PbSO 4), cerrusite (PbCO 3), galena (PbS), pyrite (FeS 2) and marcasite (FeS 2). Whereas more acid pH values (between 3 and 4. 9) were encountered in the deeper part of the tailing (between 2. 6 and 4 m depth), a lower mobility of Zn, Pb and Cd was found compared to the upper part of the tailing, where pH was in the range 5 - 7. The oxidation of sulphide minerals within the mine tailing releases H+, SO 42 -, Fe 2 +, and trace metals into the porewater. Subsequent pH-buffering in carbonate-rich layers results in the precipitation of secondary minerals such as ZnCO 3, FeCO 3 and CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O. These precipitation processes result in the formation of cemented layers, which show an enrichment in Cd and Zn. Whereas the carbonate-rich layers provide some natural attenuation of contaminants, elevated Zn-, Pb- and Cd concentrations are found in the porewater in the surface layers of the tailing (0 - 2. 6 m depth). In the mine tailing of Angleur, XRD analysis revealed the presence of several oxides and silicates such as franklinite (ZnFe 2 O 4), willemite (Zn 2 SiO 4), wollastonite (CaSiO 3), and traces of sulphates, sulphides and carbonates. pH was neutral to slightly alkaline for al the samples investigated. The upper part of the tailing (0 - 0. 7 m depth) was less contaminated than the lower part (0. 7 - 4 m depth). Contrary to the tailing material in La Calamine and despite the elevated total heavy metal and arsenic concentrations on the site, the DIN 38414 -S 4 leaching test indicates that heavy metal release is very limited and far below European limit values for slag material on <b>dumps</b> (category 1). <b>Table</b> 1 : Total Pb-, Zn-, Cd- and As-concentrations in the mine tailings and the surrounding of the mine tailings of La Calamine and Angleur.

In Angleur, vitreous phases seem very important in controlling heavy metal mobility since metals that are locked up in a silicate matrix are protected against leaching. Liming will not be an effective remediation option for the tailing in Angleur, since As and Pb will be mobilised when pH increases (Fig. 1). However, for the La Calamine dredged mine tailing pond sediments, a pH-increase significantly decreases the leachability of Zn, Cd and Pb, whereas the solubility of As is not affected and remains very low. The addition of phosphates in combination with liming results in an additional decrease of heavy metal solubility and contributes to a reduction of the release of Pb, Zn and Cd into the environment. Fig. 1 : pH-dependent leaching behaviuor of Pb, Cd and As in a sample from the tailing of La Calamine (a) and Angleur (b). Total Pb-, Cd- and As-concentrations and pH of the samples are also indicated. 4. Conclusion In La Calamine, liming and the addition of phosphates can effectively reduce heavy metal leaching from the tailing. However, at both locations, wind erosion and runoff can cause the spreading of fine-grained dust, especially since the waste material is not covered. For a sustainable development of the mining areas of La Calamine and Angleur surface stabilisation is also necessary. status: publishe...|$|R
