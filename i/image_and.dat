40|$|Sounds, <b>Images</b> <b>and</b> Data 2015 is {{a conference}} that {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} the artists and curators in creating new experiences and aesthetics in the 21 st century. By mixing a series of contemporary technologies, Big Data, social media practices and innovative approaches both to curating and artistic practices, contemporary creators and commentators are envisaging and constructing a different world where different strands collide. These practices could be defined as convergent, but they actually bring a complexity to the field of studies that cannot be subsumed under an homologating system, rather it appears to produce multiple and sometimes contradictory aesthetics. Focusing on: Curating Sounds, <b>Images</b> <b>and</b> Big Data Artistic Practices in Sounds, <b>Images</b> <b>and</b> Big Data Theories of Sounds, <b>Images</b> <b>and</b> Big Data Aesthetics of Sounds, <b>Images</b> <b>and</b> Big Data Convergence or Divergence? Experimental Practices of Sounds, <b>Images</b> <b>and</b> Big Data Sounds, <b>Images</b> <b>and</b> Big Data in Relation to Traditional Practices Aims of the Conference: The aim of the conference is to bring together artists, theorists, scholars, sound engineers, historians and curators. The conference speakers will present papers that respond to the themes of sound art, <b>images</b> <b>and</b> data and that will range from artistic practices, historization processes, aesthetics and curatorial studies, spanning from the fine arts to contemporary media arts, cultural representations and including archiving practices. The conference is also opened to areas of conceptualization, aesthetic and philosophical analyses of sounds, <b>images</b> <b>and</b> data.

5|$|In {{discrete}} tomography, {{a simplified}} {{version of the}} problem that has been frequently studied, the shape to be recovered is a polyomino (a subset of the squares in the two-dimensional square lattice), and the cross-sections provide aggregate information about the sets of squares in individual rows and columns of the lattice. For instance, in the popular nonogram puzzles, also known as paint by numbers or griddlers, the set of squares to be determined represents the dark pixels in a binary <b>image,</b> <b>and</b> the input given to the puzzle solver tells him or her how many consecutive blocks of dark pixels to include in each row or column of the <b>image,</b> <b>and</b> how long each of those blocks should be. In other forms of digital tomography, even less information about each row or column is given: only {{the total number of}} squares, rather than the number and length of the blocks of squares. An equivalent version {{of the problem is that}} we must recover a given 0-1 matrix given only the sums of the values in each row and in each column of the matrix.|$|E

The film is considered a step forward in both film grammar and structure. Contemporary audiences may find it rather hoary, although one scholar has noted the format would be familiar to fans of the dog character Lassie.|$|E
