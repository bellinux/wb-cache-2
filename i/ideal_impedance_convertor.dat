40|$|A {{broadside}} radiating, linearly polarized, electrically small Huygens source {{antenna system}} that has a large impedance bandwidth is reported. The bandwidth performance is facilitated by embedding non-Foster components into the near-field resonant parasitic elements of this metamaterial-inspired antenna. High-quality and stable radiation performance characteristics are achieved over the entire operational bandwidth. When the ideal non-Foster components are introduced, the simulated impedance bandwidth witnesses approximately a 17 -fold enhancement over the passive case. Within this - 10 -dB bandwidth, its maximum realized gain, radiation efficiency, and front-to-back ratio (FTBR) are, respectively, 4. 00 dB, 88 %, and 26. 95 dB. When the anticipated actual negative <b>impedance</b> <b>convertor</b> circuits are incorporated, the impedance bandwidth still sustains more than a 10 -fold enhancement.

For evanescent waves, the definitions of the group delay and the reshaping delay get interchanged in comparison to propagating waves. The total delay times for the evanescent waves can be negative in an infinite plasma medium even for broad-band pulses. The total time is, however, positive for broad band pulses {{in the presence of}} an interface when the radiation is detected outside the plasma. We find evidence of the Hartman effect for pulses when the distance traversed in the plasma is much smaller than the free space pulse length. We also show that for a negative refractive index medium(NRM) with ϵ(ω) = μ(ω) the reshaping delay for propagating waves is identically zero. The total delay time in NRM is otherwise dominated by the reshaping delay time, and for broad band pulses in NRM the total delay time is subluminal...|$|R

The rectenna is printed on high permittivity, low-loss board ARLON AD 1000 (r = 10. 35 and tan δ = 0. 0023 @ 10 GHz). The rectifier section is realized with a single reverse-biased schottky diode SMS- 7630 in reverse topology for which a diode model is obtained at − 20 dBm for frequencies F 0 = 2. 45 GHz and 2 F 0 = 4. 9 GHz.

40|$|Electrical Impedance Tomography is a non-invasive, non-ionizing, {{non-destructive}} and painless {{imaging technology}} that can distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous cells by reproducing tomographic {{images of the}} electrical impedance distribution within the body. The primary scope of this thesis {{is the study of}} hardware modules required for an EIT system. The key component in any EIT system is the excitation system. Impedance measurement can be performed by applying either a current or voltage through emitting electrodes and then measuring the resulting voltages or current on receiving electrodes. In this research, both types of excitation systems are investigated and developed for the Sussex EIM system. Firstly, a current source (CS) excitation system is investigated and developed. The performance of the excitation system degrades due to the unwanted capacitance within the system. Hence two CS circuits: Enhance Howland Source (EHS) and EHS combined with a General <b>impedance</b> <b>convertor</b> (GIC: to minimise the unwanted capacitance) are evaluated. Another technique (guard-amplifier) has also been investigated and developed to minimise the effect of stray capacitance. The accuracy of both types of CS circuits are evaluated in terms of its output impedance along with other performance parameters for different loading conditions and the results are compared to show their performance. Both CS circuits were affected by the loading voltage problem. A bootstrapping technique is investigated and integrated with both CS circuits to overcome the loading voltage problem. The research shows that both CS circuits were unable to achieve a high frequency bandwidth (i. e. ≥ 10 MHz) and were limited to 2 - 3 MHz. Alternatively, a discrete components current source was also investigated and developed to achieve a high frequency bandwidth and other desirable performance parameters. The research also introduces a microcontroller module to control the multiplexing involved for different CS circuit configurations via serial port interface software running on a PC. For breast cancer diagnosis, the interesting characteristics of breast tissues mostly lie above 1 MHz, therefore a wideband excitation source covering high frequencies (i. e. ≥ 1 - 10 MHz) is required. Hence, a second type of the excitation system is investigated. A constant voltage source (VS) circuit was developed for a wide frequency bandwidth with low output impedance. The research investigated three VS architectures and based on their initial bandwidth comparison, a differential VS system was developed to provide a wide frequency bandwidth (≥ 10 MHz). The research presents the performance of the developed VS excitation system for different loading configurations reporting acceptable performance parameters. A voltage measurement system is also developed in this research work. Two different differential amplifier circuits were investigated and developed to measure precise differential voltage at a high frequency. The research reports a performance comparison of possible types of excitation systems. Results are compared to establish their relationship to performance parameters: frequency bandwidth, output impedance, SNR and phase difference over a wide bandwidth (i. e. up to 10 MHz).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a linear and direct method of analysing {{the interaction of}} waveform distortion around an HVdc convertor. Existing analysis techniques are reviewed, and their strengths and weaknesses outlined. Both time domain simulation and iterative harmonic domain solutions are potentially very accurate. However, the lack of insight they provide into the important mechanisms of waveform distortion interaction, coupled with the computational expense (time domain), or limitation to steady state integer harmonics (harmonic domain), are considerable shortcomings. The frequency domain transfer function approach is chosen, and extended to cover the most important mechanisms of frequency transfer. The developed approach is used first to consider the convertor in isolation, secondly to consider the convertor coupled with either the ac system or the dc system impedance, and finally the convertor embedded within both an ac and dc system. In this way {{the importance of the}} different mechanisms of distortion transfer through a convertor are established, the frequency dependent <b>impedance</b> of a <b>convertor</b> is developed, and a description of waveform distortion dynamics around a convertor with realistic ac and dc conditions is achieved. A new indicator, the Saturation Stability Factor, is used to describe the dynamics of transformer core saturation instability. The linearised frequency domain convertor model is demonstrated to have useful accuracy, and with its ease and speed of use should prove a useful complement to existing analysis techniques. Finally, a new control system structure for back -to-back HVdc links is proposed, fully utilising the proximity of the rectifier and inverter.

The <b>ideal</b> line termination <b>impedances</b> for a flat transfer function with linear phase (pure delay) are derived, using an s-parameter wire-pair model. It is shown that a driver with series capacitance {{on the one hand}} and a resistive load on the other, are fair approximations of these ideal terminations in the frequency range of interest. From a perspective of power efficiency, a capacitive driver is preferred, as the series capacitance reduces the voltage swing along the line which reduces dynamic power consumption. To reduce cross-talk and maintain data integrity, parallel differential interconnects with alternatingly one or two twists are used. In combination with a low offset dynamic sense amplifier at the receiver, and a low-power decision feedback equalization technique with analog feedback, gigabit communication is demonstrated at very low power consumption.

All impedance responses can be modelled with a porous electrode theory to extract reliable electronic and ionic conductivities, which agree with the results of other independent measurements. [...] The impedances of PPY/CIO₄ and PPY/PSS reveal dominant anion and cation transport, respectively, in these polymers. A strong interaction between the anions and the positive charges on the oxidized polypyrrole chains hinders anion movement in PPY/CIO₄. Absence of such an interaction for the mobile cations in PPY/PSS gives this polymer a ca. 20 times higher ionic conductivity than PPY/CIO₄. [...] Deviation from the <b>ideal</b> model <b>impedance</b> response occurs for poly-MPCA because of its non-uniform structure. Mixed ion conduction can cause another type of deviation as shown by the impedance of PPY/CIO₄ +PSS polymers and the simulated data. High frequency data for reduced films of PPY/PSS and poly-MPCA form a semicircle in the complex impedance plane. This semicircle is attributed to electron transfer at the Pt/polymer interface for PPY/PSS but ion transfer at the polymer/solution interface for poly-MPCA.

The circular geometry is then used to demonstrate an RF MEMS switched capacitor with 10 W power handling at 10 GHz under hot-switching conditions that maintains a relatively-low (< 30 V) pull-in voltage. The device consists of separate RF and DC electrodes, which are defined underneath a temperature-stable circular beam, to result in both increased restoring force above the RF electrode and higher RF self-actuation voltage. This thesis also presents a compact low-loss tunable X-Band bandstop filter that is implemented on a quartz substrate using both miniature RF-MEMS capacitive switches and GaAs varactors. The 2 -pole filter is based on capacitively loaded folded-[lambda] resonators that are coupled to a microstrip line, and the filter analysis includes the effects of non-adjacent inter-resonator coupling. The RF MEMS loaded filter results in a measured 25 dB improvement in power handling and linearity compared to the GaAs varactor design. Finally, a 1. 6 - 2. 4 GHz suspended 3 -pole RF MEMS tunable filter is presented. The filter results in an insertion loss of 1. 34 - 3. 03 dB over the tuning range and a 3 -dB bandwidth of 201 - 279 MHz. This design results in a tunable Q_u of 50 - 150 over the frequency range, and to our knowledge, is the first suspended RF MEMS filter with the best Q_u.
