5|$|In 1907, Sadler began giving {{lectures on}} the Chautauqua adult-education circuit, which {{featured}} itinerant speakers discussing self-help and morality. Sadler often spoke about attaining {{physical and mental}} health without drugs. He also promoted hydrotherapy and discussed moral issues that related to men. Sadler, his wife, <b>her</b> <b>sister,</b> <b>and</b> a friend, formed a four-member lecture company that gave two- or three-day engagements, sometimes accompanied by an orchestra. Newspapers published favorable reviews of the productions. The lectures proved to be a lucrative endeavor: it was rumored that {{he became one of the}} best-paid Chautauqua speakers.|$|E
5|$|In late 1891, {{she left}} Poland for France. In Paris, Maria (or Marie, {{as she would}} be known in France) briefly found shelter with <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>and</b> {{brother-in-law}} before renting a garret closer to the university, in the Latin Quarter, and proceeding with her studies of physics, chemistry, and mathematics at the University of Paris, where she enrolled in late 1891. She subsisted on her meager resources, suffering from cold winters and occasionally fainting from hunger.|$|E
5|$|Once Italy {{entered the}} war, Emanuele Filiberto {{was used as}} a harbor defense ship in Venice to protect the port from Austrian naval attacks. She was aided in this task by <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>and</b> the old {{battleship}} , along with two cruisers and several smaller craft. The ship remained in the Italian Navy's inventory for only a short time {{after the end of the}} war in 1918, and she was stricken from the naval register on 29 March 1920 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|Achilles {{was ordered}} {{as part of}} the 1903–04 naval {{construction}} programme as the third of four armoured cruisers. She was laid down on 22 February 1904 at Elswick by Armstrong Whitworth. The ship was launched on 17 June 1905 and completed on 22 April 1907 at the cost of £1,191,103. Like her sister ships, she joined the 5th Cruiser Squadron in 1907, and made a port visit to Russia in 1908. The ship was later transferred to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron in 1909. Achilles, accompanied by <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> , <b>and</b> three other armoured cruisers were sent to reinforce the defences of the Shetland Islands on 2 August 1914, days {{before the start of the}} First World War. She, and her squadron, was assigned to the Grand Fleet after the beginning of the war.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{was born}} in Carmarthen in 1874 to Rees Barrett, a land and road surveyor, and his second wife Anne Jones, both Welsh-speakers. She {{grew up in the}} town of Llandeilo with her elder brother Rees and a younger sister, Janette. By the 1881 Census, her mother Anne was the lone adult living at their address on Alan Road, her father having died in 1878. Barrett was educated at a {{boarding}} school in Stroud, along with <b>her</b> <b>sister,</b> <b>and</b> won a scholarship to the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. She graduated in 1904 with an external London BSc degree and became a science teacher. She taught in Llangefni, Carmarthen and Penarth.|$|E
5|$|Born on July 18, 1913, in Vincennes, Indiana, Richard Skelton was {{the fourth}} and {{youngest}} son of Ida Mae (née Fields) and Joseph Elmer Skelton. Joseph, a grocer, died two months before Richard was born; {{he had once been}} a clown with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus. During Skelton's lifetime there was some dispute about the year of his birth. Author Wesley Hyatt suggests that since he began working at such an early age, Skelton may have claimed he was older than he actually was in order to gain employment. Vincennes neighbors described the Skelton family as being extremely poor; a childhood friend remembered that her parents broke up a youthful romance between <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>and</b> Skelton because they thought he had no future.|$|E

5|$|Early on Boxing Day 1964, Hindley {{left her}} {{grandmother}} at a relative's house {{and refused to}} allow her back to Wardle Brook Avenue that night. On the same day, 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey disappeared from a funfair in Ancoats. Despite a huge search, she was not found. The following day, Hindley brought her grandmother back home. By February 1965, Patricia Hodges had stopped visiting 16Wardle Brook Avenue, but David Smith was still a regular visitor. Brady gave Smith books to read, and the two discussed robbery and murder. On Hindley's 23rd birthday, <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>and</b> brother-in-law, who had until then been living with relatives, were rehoused in Underwood Court, a block of flats not far from Wardle Brook Avenue. The two couples began {{to see each other}} more regularly, but usually only on Brady's terms.|$|E

They {{encounter}} ice and snow for the first time, and kill a segnosaur in a cave, turning the den into their nest. The older chick accompanies the two adults on hunting expeditions. One day the raptors encounter a strange creature they have never seen—a whip-tailed diplodocid who inflicts wounds on Red and her sister; the older chick is forced to set off alone and find the pack's food. This calamity coincides {{with the arrival of}} a large pack of smaller raptors known as Deinonychus. Sensing the weakness of the Utahraptor pack, they surround the nest and wait for the wounded raptors to become weak enough to attack.|$|E
5|$|From {{the onset}} of Italian {{participation}} in the war, Ammiraglio di Saint Bon {{was used as a}} harbor defense ship in Venice, along with <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>and</b> the old battleship Sardegna, as well as two cruisers and several smaller craft. After April 1916, Ammiraglio di Saint Bon was used as a floating anti-aircraft battery to defend Venice. She continued in this role {{until the end of the}} war in November 1918. The ship remained in the Italian Navy's inventory for only a short time after the end of the war; she was stricken from the naval register on 18 June 1920 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|Hal Rogers {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{because he had}} posted bail for his brother, knowing he had abused Michelle. He later {{said that he had}} promised the family he would post bail and would not renege on his promise. Investigators from Florida and Ohio also discovered that Hal Rogers had withdrawn US$7,000 from his bank {{at the time of the}} disappearance, which he was able to account for. He had planned on using it to look for his wife and daughters before he was notified of their deaths. Investigations proved conclusively that he had never left Ohio during that period. The rape of Michelle Rogers, and gossip by local people, was one of the reasons for the Florida trip, so she and <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>and</b> mother could distance themselves from the incident.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this discovery, Kate locks herself in her crime lab and tries {{to come to terms}} with what just happened, while the police struggle in vain to find any sign of Alice's corpse. These scenes are depicted amongst numerous flashback sequences that comprise most of the issue. Throughout them, back story is provided from her childhood that depicts Kate, her twin sister Beth, and their mother being kidnapped. While Kate's father is able to rescue her, it appears as though both <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>and</b> mother have been killed by the time he arrives.|$|E

Struck forward of the bridge by the cruiser's bow, Fraser was cut in half and sank immediately. All but 45 of the ship's crew were rescued by Restigouche and other nearby ships. Many of the survivors from Fraser transferred that later summer to , and were lost when that vessel sank on 22 October 1940 {{as a result of}} a collision with the freighter MV Port Fairy.|$|E

5|$|The {{fourth season}} saw Patridge {{reconcile}} with Bosworth and repair {{her relationship with}} Conrad before moving into a separate residence. Holly Montag moved from her hometown of Crested Butte, Colorado into <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>and</b> Pratt's apartment, which created tension between the sisters and Pratt. Montag was later fired from her job with Bolthouse after becoming drunk during a company event. While vacationing in Mexico, an intoxicated Montag and Pratt elope. In the season finale, Conrad and Montag appear to have reconciled, though Conrad's suspicions regarding the rumors continued to inhibit a reconciliation. Port eventually relocated to New York City to accept a position with Diane von Fürstenberg.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} the game once, the player can access the Chrysler Building and {{have access to}} the final boss, who takes the form of Aya's sister, Maya. She explains to Aya that Klamp cultivated the liver cells of the original Eve to analyze. When Melissa was giving birth to the Ultimate Being, she created a nest there. In case Melissa and the Ultimate Being failed, the purebred would remain. Aya speaks with <b>her</b> <b>sister,</b> <b>and</b> they engage in battle against the purebred. After the purebred is defeated, the mitochondria inside Aya's body begin to rebel against her. It is explained that Aya's mitochondria have now reached a higher evolutionary stage than Maya’s, but Maya's personality has suddenly become dominant and begun to fight off the Eve persona. Maya eventually wins, purging the Eve persona from herself. Somehow, Maya protects Aya by preventing the original Eve from taking over her. Aya leaves the building by herself, although she apparently has gained some sort of connection with her dead sister.|$|E

5|$|Late in 1907, Rix {{moved to}} Paris. There {{she met with}} Australian artist Emanuel Phillips Fox, went on {{sketching}} expeditions to the Jardin du Luxembourg where Ethel Carrick Fox also worked, and became {{a student at the}} Académie Delécluse, operated by academic painter Auguste Delécluse. The following year she was taught by American impressionist Richard Emil Miller. From him she acquired the use of a relatively bright colour palette, not always naturalistic, as well as his dextrous technique; she did not, however, follow his predilection for pretty compositions, favouring more direct and clear images. Continuing to acquire skills {{from a wide range of}} artists, she next studied at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, including with Swiss-born illustrator Théophile Steinlen. In the summers, Rix, together with <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>and</b> mother, would travel. In 1908 they journeyed through France and Italy, while in subsequent summers they spent time at the artists' colony at the fishing village of Étaples, in northern coastal France. Among the artists painting there was Frenchman Jules Adler, who took an interest in Rix's work, as well as many Australians, including Rupert Bunny, James Peter Quinn, Edward Officer and one of the colony's longest-term residents, Iso Rae.|$|E
5|$|Liz Sanbourne is the adopted {{daughter}} of Mr. Sanbourne and Ruby Lincoln and the adoptive sister of Eve Russell, who is Ruby's daughter {{from a previous}} marriage. Eve and Liz are both unaware of the adoption, believing that they were half-sisters. Mr. Sanbourne repeatedly molested Liz after Eve left home to be a nightclub singer, and a prostitute, and start a relationship with businessman Julian Crane. Liz blamed Eve for abandoning her to her father's sexual abuse. When she was fourteen, Liz went to Boston in search of Eve. She tracked down Julian at a jazz club {{to talk to him}} about <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>and</b> their relationship. Later that night, Alistair Crane, Julian's father, raped Liz in his son's apartment; Julian was passed out in a drunken stupor in the same room and was unaware of what happened. The rape resulted in Liz's pregnancy with Chad Harris-Crane, who was later believed to be Eve and Julian's son; Liz gave up her baby for adoption at birth, and was forced to undergo surgery that left her barren.|$|E
5|$|Marsalas keel {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Castellammare {{shipyard}} on 15 February 1911, {{the same day as}} Nino Bixio. Work on Marsala proceeded slower than on <b>her</b> <b>sister,</b> <b>and</b> she was launched on 24 March 1912, where she was named for the city where Giuseppe Garibaldi launched the Expedition of the Thousand in 1860. After completing fitting-out work, the ship was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 4 August 1914. Italy declared neutrality at the start of World War I in August 1914, but by May 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic, which could also be easily seeded with minefields. The threat from these underwater weapons was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations.|$|E
