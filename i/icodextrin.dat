40|$|Pharmacokinetics of <b>icodextrin</b> in peritoneal {{dialysis}} patients. BackgroundIcodextrin is a glucose polymer osmotic agent {{used to provide}} sustained ultrafiltration during long {{peritoneal dialysis}} (PD) dwells. A {{number of studies have}} evaluated the steady-state blood concentrations of <b>icodextrin</b> during repeated use; however, to date the pharmacokinetics of <b>icodextrin</b> have not been well studied. The current study was conducted to determine the absorption, plasma kinetics and elimination of <b>icodextrin</b> and metabolites following a single <b>icodextrin</b> exchange. MethodsThirteen PD patients were administered 2. 0 L of solution containing 7. 5 % <b>icodextrin</b> for a 12 -hour dwell. <b>Icodextrin</b> (total of all glucose polymers) and specific polymers with degrees of polymerization ranging from two to seven (DP 2 to DP 7) were measured in blood, urine and dialysate during the dwell and after draining the solution from the peritoneal cavity. ResultsA median of 40. 1 % (60. 24 g) of the total administered dose (150 g) was absorbed during the 12 -hour dwell. Plasma levels of <b>icodextrin</b> and metabolites rose during the dwell and declined after drain, closely corresponding to the one-compartment pharmacokinetic model assuming zero-order absorption and first-order elimination. Peak plasma concentrations (median Cpeak = 2. 23 g/L) were observed {{at the end of the}} dwell (median Tmax = 12. 7 h) and were significantly correlated with patients' body weight (R 2 = 0. 805, P < 0. 001). Plasma levels of <b>icodextrin</b> and metabolites returned to baseline within 3 to 7 days. <b>Icodextrin</b> had a plasma half-life of 14. 73 hours and a median clearance of 1. 09 L/h. Urinary excretion of <b>icodextrin</b> and metabolites was directly related to residual renal function (R 2 = 0. 679 vs. creatinine clearance, P < 0. 01). In the nine patients with residual renal function, the average daily urinary excretion of <b>icodextrin</b> was 473 ± 77 mg per mL of endogenous renal creatinine clearance. <b>Icodextrin</b> metabolites DP 2 to DP 4 were found in the dialysate of subsequent dextrose exchanges, contributing to their elimination from blood. Changes in intraperitoneal concentrations of <b>icodextrin</b> metabolites during the dwell revealed a dual pattern, with a progressive rise in the dialysate concentration of smaller polymers (DP 2 to DP 4) and a progressive decline in the dialysate concentrations of the larger polymers (DP 5 to DP 7), suggesting some intraperitoneal metabolism of the glucose polymers. This increase in dialysate metabolite levels, however, did not contribute significantly to dialysate osmolality. In addition, some diffusion of maltose (DP 2) from blood to dialysate may have occurred. There were no changes in serum insulin or glucose levels during <b>icodextrin</b> administration, indicating that <b>icodextrin</b> does not result in hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia as occurs during dextrose-based dialysis. Serum sodium and chloride declined in parallel with the rise in plasma levels of <b>icodextrin,</b> supporting the hypothesis that these electrolyte changes are the result of the increased plasma osmolality due to the presence of <b>icodextrin</b> metabolites. ConclusionsThe pharmacokinetics of <b>icodextrin</b> in blood following intraperitoneal administration conforms to a simple, single-compartment model that can be approximated by zero-order absorption and first-order elimination. A small amount of intraperitoneal metabolism of <b>icodextrin</b> occurs but does not contribute significantly to dialysate osmolality. The metabolism of absorbed <b>icodextrin</b> and the resultant rise in plasma levels of small glucose polymers (DP 2 to DP 4) do not result in hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia, but may result in a small decrease in serum sodium and chloride...|$|E
40|$|<b>Icodextrin</b> is a starch {{derivative}} {{used for}} preparing solutions of peritoneal dialysis. Unfortunately, peptidoglycans (PGN) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) {{have been reported}} to contaminate certain <b>icodextrin</b> batches and to {{contribute to the development of}} sterile peritonitis. The decision of selecting or rejecting <b>icodextrin</b> batches is however difficult, because of limitations in the detection of these bacterial contaminants. Besides monocyte activation tests of cytokine release, a number of bio-assays using stably TLR-transfected cell lines have been developed. Here, we compared the efficacy of TLR 2 - and TLR 4 -transfected cells to detect bacterial contamination with the responses of monocytes exposed to the same <b>icodextrin</b> samples. In contrast to monocyte models of cytokine release, we found that TLR 2 - and TLR 4 -transfected cell lines are highly sensitive to detect little PGN and LPS contaminations in the presence of <b>icodextrin.</b> With the intent to increase PGN reactivity, mutanolysin was used to generate soluble fragments in <b>icodextrin</b> samples.

40|$|<b>Icodextrin</b> is a glucose polymer {{which is}} used as osmotic agent to provide {{sustained}} ultrafiltration (UF) during the long (8 - 16 hours) dwell in end-stage renal disease patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). The aims of this thesis were to study: the metabolism of <b>icodextrin</b> in the peritoneal cavity and in the circulation of PD patients and non-uremic rats, the role of alpha-amylase in its hydrolysis, {{and the rate of}} breakdown of a synthetic maltoheptaose (G 7) ex vivo which we propose as a novel measure of amylase mediated oligosaccharide metabolism. Study I. Gel-filtration HPLC was applied to determine high and low molecular weight <b>icodextrin</b> molecules in dialysate and plasma from PD patients using glucose solution or <b>icodextrin</b> (after the first dwell or chronically). Total hydrolysis of the samples was used to validate the results. 39 % of the infused <b>icodextrin</b> was absorbed from the peritoneal cavity during the long dwell. The plasma concentration of <b>icodextrin</b> metabolites was significantly higher and alpha-amylase activity significantly lower in the <b>icodextrin</b> groups. Study II. An assay for measurement of total alpha-amylase activity in serum containing <b>icodextrin</b> degradation products was validated. The study demonstrated that the low values of plasma alpha-amylase activity in PD patients using <b>icodextrin</b> are correctly determined. Study III. In 23 non-uremic rats undergoing chronic PD using either glucose- or icodextrinbased dialysis solutions, a 4 -hour dwell with <b>icodextrin</b> was performed twice, at days 10 and 21. There was a significant decrease in amylase activity in plasma (which is much higher than in humans) and an increase in dialysate. About 60 % of the infused <b>icodextrin</b> was absorbed from the peritoneal cavity {{at the end of the}} dwell. No <b>icodextrin</b> metabolites were detected in plasma at the end of the dwell. Study IV. The rate of degradation of G 7 in plasma from healthy controls, and PD patients using only glucose solution or glucose in combination with <b>icodextrin</b> was investigated ex vivo. Samples were spiked with G 7 and/or synthetic amylase, and incubated 4 hours at 37 oC. The G 7 degradation rate was lower in plasma from <b>icodextrin</b> patients but it was also reduced in PD patients using glucose, in spite of the higher amylase activity, as compared with the controls. This suggests that the amylase mediated carbohydrate metabolism is reduced in PD patients. It is possible that this could contribute to reduced hyperglycemic changes, especially in patients using <b>icodextrin.</b> Study V. When investigating also pre-dialysis (PreD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients, we found that the rate of degradation of G 7 did not differ from the controls. Amylase activity was increased in the PreD, HD and GLU patients, and decreased in the ICO patients. The rate of G 7 degradation per unit of amylase activity was reduced in PreD and GLU patients. The rate of G 7 degradation was related to the endogenous amylase activity. These findings suggest that the amylase mediated oligosaccharide metabolism is altered in uremic patients, although this needs to be confirmed in larger studies. Study VI. The relationship between the efficacy of <b>icodextrin</b> in changing UF, fluid status and residual urine volume versus the concentration of plasma <b>icodextrin</b> metabolites was investigated.

DESIGN: A nonrandomized, single group, repeated measures study. PATIENTS: Ten peritoneal dialysis patients underwent a single 8 -hour exchange of a 7. 5 % <b>icodextrin</b> solution. All patients were naive to <b>icodextrin.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A modified three-pore model was used to model solute and fluid transport during each 8 -hour exchange. Concordance correlation coefficients were used to estimate the level of agreement between modeled and measured values of net ultrafiltration (UF) and intraperitoneal volume. METHODS: Each patient underwent a modified 8 -hour standard peritoneal permeability analysis using a 2 -L 7. 5 % <b>icodextrin</b> exchange. Dextran 70 was added to the <b>icodextrin</b> solution as volume marker to estimate fluid transport kinetics. Transcapillary UF, fluid absorption, and intraperitoneal volumes were assessed via the volume marker at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 300, 360, 420, and 480 minutes.

In the canola oil group, the histiocytic reactions were significantly increased (p = 0. 001), and the hydroxyproline levels were significantly lower than those in the other groups (p = 0. 034). CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, canola oil was determined to be superior to 4 % <b>icodextrin</b> in lowering hydroxyproline levels and increasing histiocytic reactions. Considering these results, we believe that canola oil is a promising agent for preventing adhesion formation...|$|E
40|$|Background. Randomized {{trials have}} shown that <b>icodextrin</b> reduces the volume of extra-cellular fluid (ECFv) with {{variable}} effects on residual renal function. To explore this fluid shift and its possible mechanisms in more detail, prospectively collected data from one such trial, including measures of inflammation (C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-a, albumin and low and high molecular weight hyaluronan) ANP (atrial naturetic peptide), an indirect marker of intra-vascular Volume, plasma concentrations of <b>icodextrin</b> metabolites and alpha-amylase activity were analysed. Methods. 50 patients were randomized to either 2, 27 % glucose or <b>icodextrin</b> (n = 28) ford long exchange following a month run in. Blood samples were obtained at - 1, 0, 3 and 6 months, coincident with measurements Of urine volume and fluid status. Results. In both randomized groups, a significant correlation between the fall in ECFv and the decline in urine Volume was observed (P = 0. 001), although the relative drop in urine volume for patients randomized to <b>icodextrin</b> tended to be less. At baseline, ANP was higher in patients with proportionately more ECFv for a given body water or height. <b>Icodextrin</b> patients had non-significantly higher ANP levels at baseline, whereas by 3 (P = 0. 026) and 6 months (P = 0. 016) these differed between groups due to divergence. There was a correlation between increasing ANP and reduced ECF at 3 months, r = - 0. 46, P = 0. 007. in patients randomized to <b>icodextrin,</b> but not glucose. There were no relationships between fluid Status and any inflammatory markers at any point of the Study, {{with the exception of}} albumin at baseline, r = - 0. 39, P = 0. 007. Amylase activities at - 1 month and baseline were highly correlated, r = 0. 89, P < 0. 0001. Within patients, concentrations of <b>icodextrin</b> metabolites were highly correlated: the only predictor of between-patient variability oil multivariate analysis was body weight. There was no relationship between plasma concentrations of <b>icodextrin</b> metabolites and any of the other clinical parameters, including change in daily Ultrafiltration, urine volume, fluid or inflammatory status. Conclusions. This analysis supports observational data that changes in fluid status are associated with changes ill urine volume. <b>Icodextrin</b> was not associated with a greater fall ill urine Output despite its larger effect on ECFv Changes ill fluid status Could not be explained or did not appeal to influence systemic inflammation. Nor call they be explained by individual variability in plasma concentrations of <b>icodextrin</b> that are in turn inversely proportional to the volume of distribution...|$|E
30|$|The {{potential}} effects of anti-adhesion products on peritonitis are an essential concern {{when one is}} considering {{the use of such}} agents in sites at risk of infection. Data from animal models suggest that <b>icodextrin</b> 4 % solution is unlikely to affect patient recovery adversely or increase the risk of infection/peritonitis [17, 25]; in a rat infection potentiation model, 4 % <b>icodextrin</b> produced no difference in mortality, abscess formation, or overall abscess score [17]. One case of peritonitis was recorded in the ARIEL gynaecology registry and was unrelated to the use of <b>icodextrin</b> 4 % solution; this suggests that the agent can be used without increasing the risk of onset of peritonitis.|$|E

Although <b>icodextrin</b> {{has been}} shown to augment peritoneal {{ultrafiltration}} in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, its impact upon other clinical end points, such as technique survival, remains uncertain. This systematic review evaluated the effect of <b>icodextrin</b> use on patient level clinical outcomes. Methods. The Cochrane CENTRAL Registry, MEDLINE, Embase and reference lists were searched (last search 13 Sep-tember 2012) for randomized controlled trials of <b>icodextrin</b> versus glucose in the long dwell exchange. Summary esti-mates of effect were obtained using a random effects model. Results. Eleven eligible trials (1222 patients) were identified.

30|$|This is {{the first}} {{meta-analysis}} of the efficacy of 4  % <b>icodextrin</b> solution as an adhesion prevention agent in gynaecological surgery to the authors’ knowledge. It has demonstrated {{that there is a}} dearth of evidence regarding the use of 4  % <b>icodextrin</b> solution. The findings suggest that currently, there is insufficient evidence to support that 4  % <b>icodextrin</b> solution is effective at preventing adhesions in gynaecological surgery compared to RLS. Although 4  % <b>icodextrin</b> solution is cheaper and easier toapply than other commercial adhesion-prevention agents, if it does not prevent adhesions it is neither in the patient’s best interest, or cost-effective to continue using it. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommends that the mAFS score should be used when evaluating adhesion prevention agents; however in addition to this, data should be published in complete and in a way which allows for comparison with other studies. Alternative adhesion prevention agents should continue to be considered for gynaecological surgery.|$|E
40|$|Early {{quality of}} life {{benefits}} of <b>icodextrin</b> in peritoneal dialysis. BackgroundThe impact of new therapies on patient {{quality of life}} (QOL) is emerging as an important indicator {{of the value of}} these therapies. In patients on dialysis, previous QOL evaluations have focused mainly on comparative approaches between modalities, or on longitudinal trends within a modality, but few have evaluated technical innovations or introduction of new therapies. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the early effects of a new dialysis solution (<b>icodextrin)</b> on the QOL of peritoneal dialysis patients. The QOL is compared with that of patients on dextrose, and the impact of demographic, and clinical characteristics on patients' QOL is examined. MethodsThe kidney disease quality of life questionnaire (KDQOL) was administered to patients who participated in a phase III double-blind, parallel group, active-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution containing <b>icodextrin</b> in comparison with dextrose PD solution. A total of 93 patients (58 <b>icodextrin,</b> and 35 dextrose) completed the questionnaire at both baseline and after 13 weeks. In addition to patients QOL, patients' demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded at both baseline and 13 weeks. ResultsMean change scores from baseline to 13 weeks of <b>icodextrin</b> patients were substantially higher (≥ 5) than dextrose, particularly with respect to general health perception, physical functioning, role-physical, and many KDQOL symptom items such as lack of strength, washed out or drained, lack of appetite, faintness or dizziness, dry skin, cramps after an exchange or treatment, cramps during an exchange or treatment, and muscle spasms or twitching. At 13 weeks, <b>icodextrin</b> patients had significantly improved symptoms, and rated their health in general higher than those patients in the dextrose group. Upon multivariate analysis, <b>icodextrin</b> contributed significantly to the improvement of patients' mental health, general health, and symptoms such as muscle spasms or twitching, cramps during an exchange or treatment, cramps after an exchange or treatment, itchy skin, and faintness or dizziness. ConclusionsPeritoneal dialysis patients treated with <b>icodextrin</b> experienced substantial quality of life improvement at 13 weeks after the start of treatment when compared to dextrose patients. Further research is necessary to determine patients' quality of life over time in a longitudinal study setting...|$|E
