5|$|Like {{the modern}} pygmy hippopotamus, the Malagasy pygmy hippo has {{eyes on the}} side of its head rather than high orbits and teeth {{similar to those of the}} pygmy hippopotamus. The Malagasy pygmy hippo <b>is</b> <b>similarly</b> less aquatic, with many of its fossils found in the forested {{highlands}} of Madagascar.|$|E
5000|$|A player may <b>be</b> <b>similarly</b> {{awarded the}} Hero of the People Victory Point for having {{at least three}} Fame Points and {{strictly}} more than the opponent, which must <b>be</b> <b>similarly</b> relinquished.|$|R
50|$|During Truly's stint on {{the show}} Compo <b>was</b> <b>similarly</b> often {{involved}} in dangerous situations against his will. Though Truly <b>was</b> <b>similarly</b> pompous like his predecessors he eventually grew used to Compo's childish behaviour and the two did not argue frequently.|$|R

5|$|Most of Inchkeith is of {{volcanic}} origin {{but there are}} also sections of sandstone, coal, limestone and shale, the last named containing numerous fossils. There are also several springs on the island. Inchcolm <b>is</b> <b>similarly</b> varied, consisting of greenstone, sandstone, shale and limestone.|$|E
5|$|While {{the console}} {{versions}} of the game are fully three-dimensional, the Game Boy Advance version is rendered in an isometric style that incorporates both 2D sprites and 3D models. This version is a more traditional Tony Hawk's game, with little attention given to story or customization. The mobile phone version <b>is</b> <b>similarly</b> restricted.|$|E
5|$|Across all his {{bands and}} projects, Townsend has {{released}} twenty-three studio albums and three live albums. Townsend's trademark production style, featuring a heavily multitracked , {{has been compared}} to the styles of Phil Spector and Frank Zappa. His versatile vocal delivery ranges from screaming to an opera-esque singing, and his songwriting <b>is</b> <b>similarly</b> diverse. Townsend's musical style is rooted in metal, and his albums are written to express different aspects of his personality.|$|E
50|$|His son {{was also}} called Charles (Charles Ruthven Bickerton Blackburn AC), <b>was</b> <b>similarly</b> a Lieutenant-Colonel for the Australian Army Medical Corps (World War II), and <b>was</b> <b>similarly</b> {{associated}} with the University of Sydney, becoming the Bosch Professor and Head of the Department of Medicine in 1957.|$|R

5|$|Fauna <b>is</b> <b>similarly</b> distributed, with {{distinct}} altitudinal zonation present. The highest altitudes {{support the}} endangered mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque), cougar (Puma concolor), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), and Andean fox (Lycalopex culpaeus). Lower down, the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), margay (Leopardus wiedii), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), brocket deers (Mazama sp.), vulnerable northern pudú (Pudu mephistophiles), and endangered giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) {{can all be}} found. Bird species common in the area include the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), Andean cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruvianus), giant hummingbird (Patagona gigas), torrent duck (Merganetta armata), king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa), and swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus).|$|E
5|$|Ferrite (α-iron) is {{a fairly}} soft metal that can {{dissolve}} only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910°C). Austenite (γ-iron) <b>is</b> <b>similarly</b> soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146°C). This form of iron {{is used in the}} type of stainless steel used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.|$|E
5|$|For example, {{the unusual}} {{placement}} of the cadenza before the recapitulation {{is reflected in the}} violin concertos of Tchaikovsky (where the cadenza <b>is</b> <b>similarly</b> placed) and Sibelius (where the cadenza serves to extend the development section). Moreover, following this concerto it was very rare for a composer to leave a cadenza unwritten for the soloist to improvise as in the days of Mozart and Beethoven. The linking of the three movements also influenced other concertos, such as Liszt's Second Piano Concerto.|$|E

5|$|His films also {{typically}} {{end with}} a death, which is portrayed not as a tragedy, but as a happy moving on where the deceased looks down happily at the world below. Between Heaven and Earth ends with a birth, but it <b>is</b> <b>similarly</b> handled the passing of a character into a new world. This pattern is continued in Mr. Nobody, where two deaths open the film and a unique twist on death {{at the end of}} the film conveys a wistful sense of happiness.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen azide (HN3) {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1890 by the oxidation of aqueous hydrazine by nitrous acid. It is very explosive and even dilute solutions can be dangerous. It has a disagreeable and irritating smell {{and is a}} potentially lethal (but not cumulative) poison. It may be considered the conjugate acid of the azide anion, and <b>is</b> <b>similarly</b> analogous to the hydrohalic acids.|$|E
5|$|In the United States and Canada, {{professional}} Major League Baseball (MLB) {{teams are}} divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The major league champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. The top level of play <b>is</b> <b>similarly</b> split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League.|$|E

5|$|In the {{extended}} edition of The Two Towers, Jackson included an invented flashback scene showing that Denethor had neglected him {{in favour of}} Boromir when sending him to Rivendell, so that Faramir wanted to please his father by bringing him the Ring. (The relationship <b>is</b> <b>similarly</b> strained in the book, but his father's favouritism {{does not seem to}} affect his decisions in Ithilien.) Reviewers have opined that {{the extended}} edition presents Faramir in a more favourable light.|$|E
5|$|Schiavo {{describes}} how the FAA uses a formula ascribing specific monetary value to human lives, and how the agency allows numbers {{to decide whether the}} cost of extra safety is worth the additional expense. For example, if equipping an airline fleet with smoke detectors would cost $100 million, but would only save 10 lives each worth $1 million, then the expense is ruled out. Schiavo <b>is</b> <b>similarly</b> critical of the internal FAA politics and the FAA's administrators.|$|E
5|$|Season 4 {{continues}} with Liz's love advice {{proving to be}} a disaster for most of her male co-workers, while she meets someone who could be her love interest (Michael Sheen), despite being reluctant about it. She also attempts to buy an apartment located above hers. Meanwhile, Jack falls for two women and is forced to choose one of them - his high school sweetheart (Julianne Moore), or someone who <b>is</b> <b>similarly</b> successful as him (Elizabeth Banks) while trying to impress the Kabletown executives.|$|E

5|$|Strontium is a {{divalent}} silvery metal with a {{pale yellow}} tint whose properties are mostly intermediate between and {{similar to those}} of its group neighbors calcium and barium. It is softer than calcium and harder than barium. Its melting (777°C) and boiling (1655°C) points are lower than those of calcium (842°C and 1757°C respectively); barium continues this downward trend in the melting point (727°C), but not in the boiling point (2170°C). The density of strontium (2.64g/cm3) <b>is</b> <b>similarly</b> intermediate between those of calcium (1.54g/cm3) and barium (3.594g/cm3). Three allotropes of metallic strontium exist, with transition points at 235 and 540°C.|$|E
5|$|The Singapore {{position}} may {{be compared}} with the situation in other jurisdictions. In Malaysia, the right to vote is entrenched in Article 119 of the Federal Constitution, but suffrage <b>is</b> <b>similarly</b> denied to those serving prison terms. In Yazid bin Sufaat v. Suruhanjaya Pilihanraya Malaysia (2009), it was held that while detainees under the Internal Security Act 1960– who have not been convicted of any crime– still enjoy the right to vote in national elections, that right may only be exercised only in the constituencies they are registered in, and does not extend to allowing them to vote while incarcerated elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The cap {{flesh is}} {{composed}} of two distinct layers: a thin, compact, black-brown and hairy upper layer, and a thick, soft, white to light brown lower layer that is made of thin, thread-like filaments arranged in a roughly parallel fashion. The stem <b>is</b> <b>similarly</b> divided, with a thin, dark and hairy cortical layer covered by hairs, which encircles inner ochre-colored flesh. A drop of potassium hydroxide applied {{to the surface of}} the mushroom will cause it to instantly stain black.|$|E
