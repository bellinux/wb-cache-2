In {{the rest of the}} nation, Covenanters gradually gained political control. Coll (along with the lands of the MacLeans of Duart) was under the shrieval authority of the sheriff of Argyll; under pressure from the Earl of Argyll, {{one of the most powerful}} Covenanter leaders, shrieval authority over Rùm was transferred from Inverness to the Argyll sheriff, which was under the control of the Earl's family.|$|E
5|$|Bats {{employ a}} number of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most species are polygynous, where males mate with multiple females. Male pipistrelle, noctule and vampire bats may claim and defend resources that attract females, such as roost sites, and mate with those females. Males that are unable to claim a site are forced {{to live on the}} periphery where they have less reproductive success. Promiscuity, where both sexes mate with multiple partners, exists in species like the Mexican free-tailed bat and the little brown bat. Nevertheless, there <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be bias towards certain males among females in these bats. In a few species, such as the yellow-winged bat and spectral bat, adult males and females form monogamous pairs. Lek mating, where males aggregate and compete for female choice though display, is rare in bats but notably occurs in the highly sexually dimorphic hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus).|$|E
5|$|Julius Seelye Bixler {{reviewed}} the book twice, in 1952 and 1953. In his first review {{he wrote that}} he believed Stace was trying to have his {{cake and eat it}} with regards to the truth of both naturalism and mysticism. Bixler also wonders whether the revelation of God can really be free of concepts and thus whether time and eternity are utterly unrelated as Stace maintains. He identifies points in Stace’s thought where there is continuity between these two states and mystical language <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> refer to concepts. Finally he rejects the book’s analogy of mystical experience to the evocative power of art, maintaining that art must be somewhat related to logic. Nonetheless, Bixler does concur that the book is a fascinating confessio fidei and personal statement. A year later, he reviewed Time and Eternity alongside Religion and the Modern Mind. As well as reiterating the points he had made earlier, Bixler judges the second book more favourably and recommends reading the two together to better understand the problems they address.|$|E

5|$|Metanephrops challengeri is {{currently}} listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, {{due in part}} to the Quota Management System put in place by the New Zealand government. The species <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be declining, however, based both on burrow counts and analyses of catch per unit effort. Estimates of the total population size of M.challengeri vary depending on the methods used. Based on indirect measures, such as burrow counts, there may be as many as 28million individuals, and the annual catch might represent only 2%–4% of the total population. Using more reliable figures based on those animals seen during surveys, there may be only 2–11million individuals available to trawlers, and the annual catch may remove 12%–28% of that population. Bycatch from the New Zealand scampi fishery has included the New Zealand sea lion, Phocarctos hookeri, which is considered a vulnerable species by the IUCN.|$|E

While sharing of emotional events involves self-disclosure, feelings of shame and guilt are associated with concealment of the self.|$|E
25|$|Although the numbat finds termite mounds {{primarily}} using scent, it has {{the highest}} visual acuity of any marsupial, and, unusually for marsupials, has {{a high proportion of}} cone cells in the retina.

Numbats regularly enter a state of torpor, which may last up to fifteen hours a day during the winter months.|$|E
25|$|However, {{even after}} {{accounting}} for sampling bias, there <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be a gradual decrease in extinction and origination rates during the Phanerozoic.

25|$|This theology, though {{original}} in some respects, {{has often}} been compared to Adoptionism, Arianism, and Sabellianism, all of which Trinitarians rejected in favour of the belief that God exists eternally in three distinct persons. Nevertheless, Servetus rejected these theologies in his books: Adoptionism, because it denied Jesus's divinity; Arianism, because it multiplied the hypostases and established a rank; and Sabellianism, because it seemingly confused the Father with the Son, though Servetus himself <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> have denied or diminished the distinctions between the Persons of the Godhead, rejecting the Trinitarian understanding of One God in Three Persons.|$|E
25|$|Caste itself {{seems to}} have been of low {{importance}} as a social identifier. Even the Kakatiya kings, with one exception, considered themselves to be Shudras (in the ritual varna system). They were egalitarian in nature and promoted their subordinate warrior-chiefs who were similarly egalitarian and spurned the Kshatriya rank. Anyone, regardless of birth, could acquire the nayaka title to denote warrior status, and this they did. There is also little evidence that Kakatiya society paid much regard to caste identities, in the sense of jāti. Although occupation <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> have been an important designator of social position, the inscriptions suggest that people were not bound to an occupation by birth.|$|E

25|$|Some {{commentators}} {{have argued that}} physicians have duties to serve as role models {{for the general public}} in matters of health, for example by not smoking cigarettes. Indeed, in most western nations relatively few physicians smoke, and their professional knowledge <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> have a beneficial effect on their health and lifestyle. According to a study of male physicians, life expectancy is slightly higher for physicians (73.0 years for white and 68.7 for black) than lawyers or many other highly educated professionals. Causes of death less likely in physicians than the general population include respiratory disease (including pneumonia, pneumoconioses, COPD, but excluding emphysema and other chronic airway obstruction), alcohol-related deaths, rectosigmoidal and anal cancers, and bacterial diseases.|$|E
25|$|Chatterjee {{asserts that}} the pelvic girdle is apomorphic {{comparative}} to archaic birds and displays a retroverted pubis, fusion of the ischium and ilium, an antitrochanter, {{and the presence of}} a renal fossa. The pubis <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> display opisthopuby, although this has yet to be verified. The alleged fusion of the ischium and ilium into an ilioischiadic plate is currently not substantiated by the fossils at hand, despite Chatterjee's auspicious illustration to the contrary in The Rise of Birds. At this time the pelvic girdle is not sufficiently well preserved to ascertain whether or not a renal fossa was present, although as no known avian from the Mesozoic displays a renal fossa, it is not clear why Protoavis should, even if it is more derived than Archaeopteryx. Similarly, it is unclear if the alleged antitrochanter has been correctly identified as such.|$|E
25|$|The {{merits of}} the {{allegations}} are impossible to judge, although {{it seems clear that}} Archer was acquainted with Cahill. The assassination plot was just one of many against the queen that received credence during the final decade of her reign. One sceptic has pointed out that the evidence only emerged once Father Robert Persons had published his A Conference about the Next Succession to the Crown of England. The book <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> have alarmed Elizabeth's advisers, and from that date onward the flow of supposed plots against the queen's life became steady. In 1601 Cecil himself was accused of treason at the trial of the Earl of Essex {{on the basis of his}} reading of Person's book, but survived this twist and went on to secure the succession of James I upon the queen's death two years later.|$|E

40|$|This {{study has}} {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} a massed and a spaced preservice programme of science training on the subsequent classroom practices of the graduates of these programmes after they had spent 6 months as year-one teachers. The investigation was conducted in 2 phases. Phase 1 entailed an examination of the training presented to the preservice teachers and the instructional behaviours used by the science lecturers during the presentation of training. Phase 2 involved an examination of the classroom practices of the teacher-graduates. The sample for {{the first phase of the}} study comprised 5 science lecturers and 120 preservice teachers. For Phase 2 the sample comprised 20 volunteer teachers from the earlier sample, 7 of whom had received spaced curriculum training over a period of 2 years (group 1) and 13 of whom had received massed curriculum training over a period of 6 weeks (group 2). Information gathering techniques included direct observation and audiorecording of the curriculum training sessions and the subsequent science lessons of the 2 groups of teachers, as well as structured interviews and a questionnaire. A system developed by Adams (1965) was used for the analysis of the teaching patterns of both science lecturers and teacher-graduates. The results of the study revealed that both groups of teachers: (i) indicated that they were using 47 competencies presented during preservice training with a "high" mean level of success; (ii) attributed their capability to use such competencies to preservice training, and (iii) reported that the use of these competencies had a "high" mean level of influence on their overall level of success as science teachers. The results also revealed that of the 6 teaching patterns with which they were compared, the averaged teaching patterns of both groups of teachers resembled mostly the actual teaching patterns of their respective lecturers. Moreover, on an individual basis: (i) the (averaged) functional patterns of 15 of the 20 teachers resembled the averaged functional patterns of their respective lecturers; and (ii) the (averaged) structural patterns of 18 of the 20 teachers resembled the averaged structural patterns of their respective lecturers. From this it was concluded that the teachers modelled the teaching patterns of their lecturers. In addition to such findings the following conclusions were drawn from the study: (i) Both massed and spaced enquiry-oriented, science curriculum training <b>did</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be effective means for ensuring teacher-use of competencies provided during preservice training. (ii) Positive transfer of training <b>did</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> have resulted from programmes of training with the same objectives of the syllabus which the graduates of these programmes subsequently used. (iii) Preservice training in science teaching did effect positive teacher attitudes towards the teaching of science. (iv) Preservice training in science teaching <b>did</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> influence the teachers' own perceptions of how elementary science should be taught. (v) Role modelling <b>did</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be an effective means of promoting specific teaching behaviours in teachers. (vi) Although teacher-perceptions of the recommendations of their lecturers <b>did</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> influence their own concepts of how science should be taught more than the actual behaviours of their lecturers, the behaviours of their lecturers <b>did</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> have influenced their own teaching patterns more than their own recommendations. (vii) The teachers' ability to control pupils during science classes <b>did</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> have the hightest level of influence on their overall level of success as science teachers. (viii) The teachers' own knowledge and understanding of science <b>did</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be less influential on their science teaching success than was their own ability to teach whatever science they knew...|$|R

25|$|While Muslim intellectuals {{were already}} acquainted with Greek {{philosophy}} (especially logic), al-Kindi {{is credited with}} being the first real Muslim philosopher. His own thought was largely influenced by the Neo-Platonic philosophy of Proclus, Plotinus and John Philoponus, amongst others, although he <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> have borrowed ideas from other Hellenistic schools as well. He makes many references to Aristotle in his writings, but these are often unwittingly re-interpreted in a Neo-Platonic framework. This trend is most obvious {{in areas such as}} metaphysics and the nature of God as a causal entity. Earlier experts had suggested that he was influenced by the Mutazilite school of theology, because of the mutual concern both he and they demonstrated for maintaining the singularity (tawhid) of God. However, such agreements are now considered incidental, as further study has shown that they disagreed on a number of equally important topics.|$|E
25|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that Master's style was closely related to that of paintings from south-western Germany and Switzerland in the period 1430–50, by artists of whom the best known is Konrad Witz. In addition, the Alpine cyclamen - a flowering plant native to the region - very frequently appears in the engravings. Although the theory proposed by Leo Baer to identify the Master as Witz has not been widely accepted, the Master <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> have been trained as an artist rather than a goldsmith like many other early engravers. His prints show an engraving technique closely related to drawing, with forms conceived in three dimensions and delicately modeled; other engravers were usually trained as goldsmiths, such as Master E. S. or Israhel van Meckenem, and their works display {{a different set of}} stylistic conventions. The Master's shading is mostly done using parallel vertical lines, and cross-hatching is rare.|$|E
