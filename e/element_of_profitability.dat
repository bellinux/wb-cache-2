40|$|Abstract—CVP (cost-volume-profit) {{analysis}} and the break-even point <b>of</b> <b>profitability</b> as its integral part {{are the most}} commonly used instruments for short-term business decision making. The theoretical basis of this concept is the accounting approximation on short term straight-line behavior of the total cost within a relevant range of activities. Information base for the construction of the break-even point <b>of</b> <b>profitability</b> provides the calculation of the variable costs. The model of the break even point is of quantitative, static and deterministic character. The conceptual paper is intended as a critical review of the theoretical assumptions of this model from the practical aspects of the application. Keywords—CVP analysis, profitability break-even point, the relevant range of activities, risk assessment. variable costs, which is based on the previously described pattern of behavior of costs and revenues. The focus of critical analysis is directed to the validity of accounting information for CVP analysis (cost-volumeprofit), the basis of which is the calculation of the variable costs. This surely does not mean that other important elements are going to be neglected. Finally, the paper critically discusses using the analytical method the theoretical assumptions of CPV {{analysis and}} its structural <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the <b>profitability</b> break-even point and margin of safety. The critical assessment is mainly based on the assessment of validity of the relevant information for decision making in dynamic and risky business environment. T I...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} industry has changed significantly {{over the last}} two decades due to the effects of globalization, delivery system innovations, increased competition, and the application of information technology. Industry professionals know that to compete in these times they need to manage their performance more efficiently and fine-tune their business strategies to maintain and improve profitability and increase the company value. However, traditional theory and understanding <b>of</b> <b>profitability</b> management are not flexible and powerful enough to lead construction firms to a higher performance in the rapidly changing market. It has been a widespread and serious problem in the {{construction industry}} that profitability appears low, unreliable, and unmanageable. ^ As a pioneer attempt in the exploration of a new theory <b>of</b> <b>profitability</b> management for construction firms, this study identifies the <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the <b>profitability</b> as: quality, potentiality, and sustainability of profits. The study presents that these three elements are interactive and integrated into a profitability system which is dynamic, adaptive, and process based. And moreover, this study develops a model for analyzing the <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> construction firms using system dynamics. The model is illustrated for the bidding practice in a typical medium-size general contractor. The study identifies the path dependency occurring in the construction practice. A small change of external variable could amplify and cause significant change in the business performance. Learning as an important strategy for the organizational unit was studied and simulated. The study found out that learning is effective and helps to improve the performance when the uncertainties are reduced. ^ As another aspect <b>of</b> the <b>profitability</b> system, company overhead is affected by the cash flow management. Overdraft, discount for timely payment, and under/overbilling constitute the most important issues regarding project cash flow management. Construction firms have to balance the material savings and overdraft in an attempt to reduce costs. Based on a case study on a warehouse project, the study finds out that payment policy can be optimized within the framework <b>of</b> the <b>profitability</b> system by integrating overdraft, material credit, and overbilling. The overdraft requirement, material discounts terms, and the overbilling strategy are analyzed and discussed in single and multiple projects environment. ...|$|R
