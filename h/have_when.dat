One barrack appears as it would <b>have</b> <b>when</b> Japanese Americans first arrived at Manzanar in 1942, while another has been reconstructed to represent barracks life in 1945. Exhibits in these barracks opened on April 16, 2015. A restored World War II mess hall, moved to the site from Bishop Airport in 2002, was opened to visitors in late 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{porpoise}} eye {{is relatively}} small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, {{the eyes of a}} porpoise are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans <b>have.</b> <b>When</b> porpoises surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; their eyes contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Porpoises do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most porpoises have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, they are able to form a very clear image of the surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{publishers}} of erotic romance are either small press publishers or electronic book publishers. Writers often have more leeway {{as to what}} types of erotic acts can be included when working with an electronic publisher than they would <b>have</b> <b>when</b> working with a print publisher. The market for erotic romances has been growing rapidly, leading some publishers to create new lines for these types of books. Some subjects are still considered taboo, even with erotic romance. Themes such as pedophilia, incest, and bestiality are discouraged by all publishers.|$|E

This changed the previous separated picture based composition and situational based writing to bring about more creativity for candidates to <b>have</b> <b>when</b> writing the composition.|$|E
25|$|On August 24, 1939, a Cleveland {{resident}} named Frank Dolezal, 52, {{was arrested}} {{as a suspect}} in Florence Polillo's murder; he later died under suspicious circumstances in the Cuyahoga County jail. After his death {{it was discovered that}} he had suffered six broken ribs—injuries his friends say he did not <b>have</b> <b>when</b> arrested by Sheriff Martin L. O'Donnell some six weeks prior. Most researchers believe that no evidence exists that Dolezal was involved in the murders, although at one time he did admit killing Florence Polillo in self-defense. Before his death, he recanted his confession and recanted two others as well, saying he had been beaten until he confessed.|$|E

The rank she <b>had</b> <b>when</b> Fortin and Farragher and Farley were playing here; the rank she <b>had</b> <b>when</b> Salmon, the invincible, tore through the opposition'".|$|R

25|$|Mammalian {{orthoreovirus}} {{does not}} really cause a significant disease in humans. Even though the virus is fairly common, the infection produced is either asymptomatic or causes a mild disease which is self-limiting in the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory region for children and infants. Symptoms are similar to what a person might <b>have</b> <b>when</b> they have the common cold, such as a low-grade fever and pharyngitits. However, in other animals such as baboons and reptiles, other known orthoreoviruses fusogenic strains can cause more serious illness. In baboons it can cause neurological illness while in reptiles {{it can be the}} cause of pneumonia. In birds this virus may even cause death.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s DA class diesel {{locomotives}} began taking over most freight duties, with steam locomotive workings ceasing in 1966. When introduced in 1972, the DX class were not common on the MNPL largely {{owing to the}} need to strengthen bridges to accommodate their weight, but as the DA class was phased out, their usage became frequent. Today all of KiwiRail's current locomotive classes (DC, DFT, DX) operate on the line, usually in multiple and with a DX class unit usually present on all services due to the power advantage they <b>have</b> <b>when</b> climbing the Westmere Bank. The peak season milk trains, for instance, are usually hauled by a pair of DX units owing to the weight of these services. A number of the new DL units are also planned to be used on MNPL services once they are introduced to the lower North Island in 2011.|$|E
25|$|The post of CIGS {{was less}} {{rewarding}} than command {{in an important}} theatre of war but the CIGS chose the generals who commanded those theatres and decided what men and munitions they should <b>have.</b> <b>When</b> it came to finding the right commanders he often complained that many officers {{who would have been}} good commanders had been killed in the First World War and that this was one reason behind the difficulties the British had {{in the beginning of the}} war. When General Sir Claude Auchinleck was to be replaced as the commander of the British Eighth Army in 1942, Brooke preferred Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery instead of Lieutenant General William Gott, who was Churchill's candidate. Soon thereafter Gott was killed in an air crash and Montgomery received the command. Brooke would later reflect upon the tragic event which led to the appointment of Montgomery as an intervention by God. Earlier in 1942 Brooke had been offered the command of British forces in the Middle East. Brooke declined, believing he now knew better than any other general how to deal with Churchill.|$|E

Gangleri then asks what entertainment the einherjar <b>have</b> <b>when</b> they're not drinking. High responds that every day, the einherjar get dressed and [...] "put on war-gear and go out into the courtyard and fight each other and fall upon each other. This is their sport." [...] High says that when dinner time arrives, the einherjar ride back to Valhalla and sit down to drink. In reference, High quotes a stanza from Grímnismál.|$|E
