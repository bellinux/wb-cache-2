5000|$|The {{original}} Pitney-Bowes specification actually varies the narrow:wide width ratio to {{make all}} characters the same width. That is, characters with 2 wide elements use a 3:1 ratio, while characters with 3 wide elements use a 2:1 ratio, so all characters are 10 narrow elements wide (plus the <b>inter-character</b> <b>space</b> makes 11). [...] "Rationalized codabar" [...] uses a fixed ratio and allows the character widths to vary.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel and effective approach to synthesize English handwriting in the user’s writing style. We select {{the most important}} features that depict the handwriting style, including character glyph, size, slant, and pressure, special connection style, letter spacing, and cursiveness. The features can be efficiently computed {{with the aid of}} our specially designed sample collecting user interface. Given ASCII text, the user handwriting is synthesized hierarchically. First, character glyphs are sampled and shape variation is added. Second, words are generated by aligning the character glyphs on the baseline with proper horizontal <b>inter-character</b> <b>space</b> and vertical offset from the baseline. The heads and tails of the letters may be trimmed to avoid severe overlap and facilitate possible connections between neighboring letters. Adjacent letters may be connected to each other by polynomial interpolation. Finally, after the pressure is assigned, the handwriting is rendered word by word and then line by line. The experimental results prove the capability of our system to adapt to the user’s writing style...|$|E

So, if <b>inter-character</b> <b>spacing</b> is large, the recognition rate will not be more affected.|$|R

The proposed method jointly evaluates features obtained from individual characters and <b>inter-character</b> <b>spaces.</b> Combining these features resolves ambiguity in segmentation and classification of low-quality character-string images. To evaluate the inter-character features, an intercharacter orthogonal subspace is constructed for each permutation of two characters.

50|$|It {{was also}} the company's first unit to {{incorporate}} a 16-bit mini-computer known as the DataMate-70. That processor's code base {{was used in the}} Chyron IV and 4100 series systems, which were the workhorses of the mobile sports graphics industry from the late 1970s through most of the 1980s. Programs and fonts were loaded from loop or disk into computer style magnetic core memory. As the font data access needed to be done more quickly than a single core memory could achieve, four core boards were used in parallel to provide faster access. It {{was also the}} first CG that had non-monospaced fonts with adjustable inter-row and <b>inter-character</b> <b>spacing.</b>|$|R
40|$|Click on the DOI link below {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that the masking effects of flankers about a target in the peripheral retina are not isotropic. Rather, regions of lateral interaction are ellipsoid in shape with the major axis oriented radially along a meridian through the fovea. This finding leads to the counterintuitive prediction that horizontal text positioned to the right of fixation might be read more slowly than similarly positioned text oriented diagonally or vertically. Similarly, vertically oriented text above fixation might be read more slowly than horizontally or diagonally oriented text above fixation. We investigated the effect of text orientation and <b>inter-character</b> <b>spacing</b> on word identification in the retinal periphery. Text was presented by rapid serial visual presentation. Words were centered 3 degrees from fixation along four visual field meridians (VM) (right horizontal, upper-right diagonal, vertical, and upper-left diagonal). Regardless of VM identification, performance was best for horizontal text, declining slightly for orientations between + 60 degrees and - 60 degrees and declining more quickly for acute orientations. A weak effect of VM was observed for text with normal <b>inter-character</b> <b>spacing.</b> Performance was best for text centered along the horizontal meridian and declined slightly along the other VM. Finally, identification rates increased by approximately 33 words min(- 1) with the addition of one character space between adjacent letters. The word-recognition processes are very tolerant of text orientation, exhibiting a modest decline for orientations within +/- 60 of horizontal regardless of VM. peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In {{document}} layout analysis, {{the defining}} conditions for textlines and text regions involve certain numerical parameters (e. g. <b>inter-character</b> <b>spacing</b> and inter-textline spacing) whose values {{can only be}} estimated when textlines and text regions have already been formed. This seemingly chicken-and-egg problem can be solved through an adaptive regrouping strategy, which consists of three operations. First, we group basic ingredients into preliminary textlines and text regions according to crude parametric values. Second, we refine our estimate of the parametric values based on the groups thus formed. Third, we form new groups by splitting and merging existing groups based on the newly estimated values. This paper applies the above strategy to Chinese documents whose complexity derives from the coexistence of horizontal and vertical textlines. Successful results are obtained using this approach. The accuracy rates for identifying text regions and textlines are above 98 % in a test database consisting of over one thousand document samples and various layout structures...|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} a {{situation}} that demands contextual kerning in the Minion Pro font is the sequence of three characters f.&rdquo; (f, period, quotation mark), as is often found {{at the end of}} a quotation. Using the font's kerning tables, the quotation mark is too close to the f, although without the period between them their spacing is adequate. The period, in other words, reduces their spacing instead of increasing it. The explanation is this: Without the period, their kerning is a positive 121 (expressed as 1000 units/em). The period's width is 228, but the kerning between f and the period is &minus;5, and between the period and the quotation mark &minus;138. The total is a positive 85, as opposed to the original 121: a net loss of 36 units, which explains why the quotation mark is now closer to the f. Contextual kerning would recognize the sequence of three characters, and would increase one or both <b>inter-character</b> <b>spaces.</b> A similar problem exists with the letters F, P, T, V, W, and Y; with comma rather than period; or with single rather than double quotation mark.|$|R
40|$|Japanese {{documents}} often contain both horizontally and vertically {{printed text}} {{lines in the}} same page. It has been required for document analysis systems to detect correct orientation of text lines and to select text line candidates of correct orientation. We designed an efficient framework for the procedure and developed some algorithms which reduce text line candidates of incorrect orientation. However, our previous system could handle only text lines with slight skew (f 10 "). In order to improve the performance of our document analysis system, we recently developed an improved algorithm for text line extraction which can handle curved or wavy text lines as well as straight text lines of arbitrary orientation. We have also developed a new candidate reduction algorithm for arbitrarily oriented text lines. This paper describes mainly the detail of the candidate reduction algorithm. The overview {{of the system is}} also mentioned. The candidate reduction algorithm is based on the a priori knowledge that inter-line spacing is much wider than <b>inter-character</b> <b>spacing</b> in most documents. Experimental results show that the algorithm works very well for many documents, including very complicated ones, written in both Japanese and English, and also for the documents which contain curved or wavy text lines. ...|$|R

50|$|With {{straight}} keys, side-swipers, and, to an extent, bugs, {{each and}} every telegraphist {{has his or her}} own unique style and pattern when transmitting a message. An operator's style is known as his ‘fist’. To other telegraphers, every fist is unique, and can be used to identify the telegrapher transmitting a particular message. This had a huge significance in the world wars, as it could be used to track the location of individual ships and submarines. See traffic analysis. However, electronic keyers (single paddle or iambic) will produce ‘perfect’ Morse at a set speed, thus only <b>inter-character</b> and inter-word <b>spacing</b> can produce a semblance of a fist.|$|R
