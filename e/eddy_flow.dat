40|$|Abstract—Eddy flow {{has been}} shown to promote focal smooth muscle cell (SMC) {{proliferation}} and neointimal formation in experimental vein grafts. This study focuses on whether the angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1) receptor mediates these events. Experimental vein grafts with and without <b>eddy</b> <b>flow</b> were created in the rat. Losartan was used to assess the influence of the AT 1 receptor on SMC proliferation. In vein grafts with <b>eddy</b> <b>flow,</b> apparent focal expression of AT 1 mRNA and protein was found in the leading region of the proximal focal neointima, where <b>eddy</b> <b>flow</b> occurred, but not in the trailing region, where <b>eddy</b> <b>flow</b> diminished, at days 5, 10, 20, and 30. The rate of SMC proliferation in the leading region (10. 961. 4 %, 19. 562. 2 %, 12. 262. 0 %, and 6. 961. 3 % at these times, respectively) was significantly higher than that in the trailing region (9. 561. 8 %, 15. 362. 0 %, 8. 261. 9 %, and 3. 260. 7 %) in these vein grafts. When <b>eddy</b> <b>flow</b> was prevented in engineered vein grafts, no apparent location difference was found in the distribution of AT 1 receptor mRNA and protein in the neointima, and the rate of SMC proliferation (5. 361. 0 %, 5. 860. 9 %, 3. 461. 0 %, and 3. 760. 9 % at days 5, 10, 20, and 30, respectively) was reduced significantly. In vein grafts with losartan, the rate of SMC proliferation in the leading region of the neointima (9. 461. 8 %, 10. 161. 3 %, 8. 360. 9 %, and 4. 260. 5 % at days 5, 10, 20, and 30, respectively) was significantly lower than that in vein grafts without losartan. These results suggested that <b>eddy</b> <b>flow</b> upregulated the AT 1 receptor, which in turn mediated focal SMC proliferation in the neointima of experimental vein grafts.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedSeventeen-month time series (May 1989 - October 1990) of current, temperature and conductivity {{were obtained from}} 100, 300 and 500 m depth at site P 2, located on the 800 m isobaths off Point Sur, and one-year time series (May 1990 - May 1991) of the same variables at similar depths were obtained from site P 3, approximately 25 km father offshore on the 1800 m isobath. Results show that no net growth or decay of eddy potential energy (EPE) occurred at wither mooring during their respective deployment periods. At mooring P 2, baroclinic instabilities within the water column were signaled by downgradient horizontal eddy heat fluxes that converted mean potential energy (MPE) to EPE at both 225 and 425 m. The dominant balance at 225 m was between mean flow advection (source) and upward eddy heat fluxes (EPE to eddy kinetic energy, EKE), with additional losses coming from downstream advection by the <b>eddy</b> <b>flow.</b> At 425 m, the dominant balance was between downgradient eddy heat fluxes (source) and downstream advection by <b>eddy</b> <b>flow</b> (sink). Unlike 225 m, vertical eddy heat fluxes at 425 m were a weak source (EKE to EPE) while mean flow advection was negligible. At P 3, the net balance involved only downward eddy heat fluxes (source) and downstream advection by <b>eddy</b> <b>flow</b> (sink), as mean advection and MPE-EPE conversions were negligible. Analysis of energetic events within the time series of terms in the EPE equation did not reveal any canonical or common pattern which would explain the temporal means described above, but suggest the flow in this region is highly variable. In fact, most events magnitudes of terms were anywhere from 1 o to 200 {{times that of the}} associated temporal mean. Events at P 2 involved both horizontal and vertical processes and had longer time scales (several days to weeks) compared to those at P 3, which had much shorter time scales and appeared to involve vertical processes only.

Linear growth is arrested when the amplitude of the long-wavelength perturbations reaches the level of background eddies.

40|$|A simple {{kinematic}} {{model has}} been used to compute Lagrangian trajectories. Although it is certainly too simple to model geophysical flows, it has provided insights into the behavior of Lagrangian tracers. In particular, the existence of trapping regions has been shown to greatly increase the dispersion rate of tracers and to lead to net tracer displacements when the Eulerian mean flow is zero. In general, the spectrum of spatial scales present in the trajectories is wider than the Eulerian spectrum and is biased towards shorter wavelengths; the disparity between the 100 -km Eulerian scale and the much shorter length scales experienced by the tracers is demonstrated. The estimation of the Eulerian parameters of the field from Lagranian observations must be done {{with a great deal of}} care, particularly if the <b>eddy</b> <b>flow</b> velocities are comparable to or exceed the mean flow. With a limited number of tracers it is extremely difficult to estimate, with any degree of confidence, the properties of either the mean Eulerian flow or the eddy field.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{mesoscale}} eddy field {{in the presence of}} coherent vortices, by means of Lagrangian trajectories released in a high-resolution ocean model, is presented in this paper. The investigation confirms previous results drawn from real float data statistics (Veneziani et al., 2004) that the eddy field characteristics are due to the superposition of two distinct regimes associated with strong coherent vortices and with a typically more quiescent background <b>eddy</b> <b>flow.</b> The former gives rise to looping trajectories characterized by subdiffusivity properties due to the trapping effect of the vortices, while the latter produces nonlooping floats characterized by simple diffusivity features. Moreover, the present work completes the study by Veneziani et al.

The main result is that the spin obtained from the looping trajectories not only represents a good estimate of the relative vorticity of the vortex core in which the loopers are embedded, but it is also able to follow the vortex temporal evolution. The Lagrangian parameter is then directly connected to the underlying Eulerian structure and could be used as a proxy for the relative vorticity field of coherent vortices. 1...|$|E
40|$|The mean-eddy {{interaction}} in a flow is investigated {{in terms of}} the energy transfer between its mean and eddy processes. In a Reynolds decomposition framework, energy transfer can be defined from the decomposed energy equations, but the definition is subjective with the classical energetics formalism. This paper shows that a faithful formalism can be rigorously established within the same framework. The resulting transfer sums to zero everywhere over the decomposed subspaces, representing a mere redistribution of energy between the mean and eddy processes, without generating or destroying energy as a whole. For this reason, it has been referred to as perfect transfer in distinction from other energy transfers one may have encountered. The perfect transfer has a simple form in expression, with the introduction of an <b>eddy</b> <b>flow</b> coupled with the mean and eddy processes of the field under concern. The eddy or turbulence production is then totally determined by the divergence of this flow. This formalism has been validated with a well-known barotropic instability model, and a wake control problem.

The role of the synoptic eddy and low-frequency flow (SELF) feedback {{in the formation of}} these dominant low-frequency modes is investigated in this paper using the linear barotropic model with the SELF feedback proposed in Part I. It is found that the AO-like and AAO-like leading singular modes of the linear dynamical system emerge from the stormy background flow {{as the result of a}} positive SELF feedback. This SELF feedback also prefers a PNA-like singular vector as well among other modes under the climatological conditions of northern winters. A model with idealized conditions of basic mean flow and activity of synoptic <b>eddy</b> <b>flow</b> and a prototype model are also used to illustrate that there is a natural scale selection for the AAO- and AO-like modes through the positive SELF feedback. The zonal scale of the localized features in the Atlantic (southern Indian Ocean) for AO (AAO) is largely related to the zonal extent of the enhanced storm track activity in the region. The meridional dipole structures of AO- and AAO-like low-frequency modes are favored because of the scale-selective positive SELF feedback, which can be heuristically understood by the tiltedtrough mechanism. 1...|$|E

The effect of varying geometry (involving changes in the film thickness or the amplitude and wavelength of the substrate) and inertia is explored separately. For Stokes-like flow and varying geometry, excellent agreement is found between prediction and existing flow visualizations and measured eddy center locations associated with the switch from attached to locally detached flow. It is argued that an appropriate measure {{of the influence of}} inertia at the substrate is in terms of a local Reynolds number based on the characteristic corrugation length scale. Since, for small local Reynolds numbers, the local flow structure there becomes effectively decoupled from the inertia-dominated overlying film and immune from instabilities at the free-surface; the influence of inertia manifests itself as a skewing of the dividing streamline (separatrix). It is shown that the {{formation and}} presence of eddies can be manipulated in one of two ways. While an decrease/increase in the corrugation steepness leads to the disappearance/appearance of kinematically induced eddies, an increase/decrease in the inertia present in the system leads to the appearance/disappearance of inertially induced eddies. A critical corrugation steepness for a given film thickness is defined, demarking the transition from a kinematically to an inertially induced local <b>eddy</b> <b>flow</b> structure and vice versa. © 2008 American Institute of Physic...|$|E

Changes in the geometry of the membrane module such as using baffles are useful to decrease this problem. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a powerful numerical tool used in modeling membrane processing. Materials and Methods: The effect of baffle geometry on the efficiency of membrane clarification of pomegranate juice in a flat-sheet module was simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The geometry of the membrane unit was plotted and meshed with Gambit software, and was solved using FLUENT software. A two-dimensional double-precision method at steady state was selected to simulate the membrane process. The convective terms were discretized with a standard first-order upwind scheme in computational solution. The RNG k-  model was used due to its high accuracy in eddy flows with a low Reynolds number. The effects on the process performance {{of the number of}} baffles, their angle and the distance between the baffles and the membrane surface were evaluated. Results: The results showed that the configuration with the feed-channel height of 2 cm, the baffle angle of 90 o and the distance between the membrane surface and baffles of 2 mm had maximum permeate flux. Conclusions: Reducing the distance between the baffles and the membrane surface increased the permeate flux due to create an <b>eddy</b> <b>flow</b> near the membrane surface in the flat-sheet module and reduced the total and cake-layer resistances.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} quantumlike mechanics in atmospheric flows with intrinsic nonlocal space-time connections manifested as the selfsimilar fractal geometry {{to the global}} cloud cover pattern concomitant with inverse power law form for power spectra of temporal fluctuations. Such long-range spatiotemporal correlations are generic to dynamical systems in nature and are recently identified as signatures of selforganized criticality, a field of study belonging to the newly emerging discipline of nonlinear dynamics and chaos. The author has presented a universal thory of chaos which postulates that spatial integration of enclosed small scale fluctuations result in the generation of a hierarchical scale invariant eddy continuum(network) with ordered two-way energy flow between the scales. The model concepts lead to the following results. (1) The eddy energy spectrum follows normal distribution characteristics,i. e.,the square of the eddy amplitude represents the probability density,a result which is observed in the subatomic dynamics of quantum systems. (2) Wave-particle duality is attributed to the bimodal (formation and dissipation) phenomenological form for manifestation {{of energy in the}} bidirectional energy flow intrinsic to eddy circulations,e. g., formation and dissipation respectively of clouds in updrafts and downdrafts of atmospheric eddies.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between synoptic eddy and low-frequency flow (SELF) {{has been recognized}} for decades {{to play an important}} role in the dynamics of the low-frequency variability of the atmospheric circulation. In this three-part study a linear framework with a stochastic basic flow capturing both the climatological mean flow and climatological measures of the synoptic <b>eddy</b> <b>flow</b> is proposed. Based on this linear framework, a set of linear dynamic equations is derived for the ensemble-mean eddy forcing that is generated by anomalous time-mean flows. By assuming that such dynamically determined eddy-forcing anomalies approximately represent the time-mean anomalies of the synoptic eddy forcing and by using a quasi-equilibrium approximation, an analytical nonlocal dynamical closure is obtained for the two-way SELF feedback. This linear closure, directly relating time-mean anomalies of the synoptic eddy forcing to the anomalous time– mean flow, becomes an internal part of a new linear dynamic system for anomalous time–mean flow that is referred to as the low-frequency variability of the atmospheric circulation in this paper. In Part I, the basic approach for the SELF closure is illustrated using a barotropic model. The SELF closure is tested through the comparison of the observed eddy-forcing patterns associated with the leading low-frequency modes with those derived using the SELF feedback closure. Examples are also given to illustrate an important role played by the SELF feedback in regulating the atmospheric responses to remote forcing. Further applications of the closure for understanding the dynamics of low-frequency modes as well as the extension of the closure to a multilevel primitive equation model will be given in Parts II and III, respectively. 1...|$|E
40|$|A low-order {{barotropic}} {{system with}} Newtonian forcing and dissipation is investigated. The system has one {{component in the}} zonal flow characterized by a Legendre function and two components in the <b>eddy</b> <b>flow</b> having the same longitudinal wave number, but different meridional indices and described by two associated Legendre functions. Five real amplitudes characterizing the system and a system of five ordinary, non-linear differential equations describe the behaviour of the system. The steady states of the system can be determined by a numerical solution of a 9 th degree equation for a given intensity of the forcing. Section 3 contains {{a description of the}} determination of the steady states and shows that up to five steady states may exist for a given forcing. The most complicated of the steady states have energy in all components of the system and the non-linear exchange of energy among the components is essential for maintaining the state. Other steady states are either zonal or contain energy in one component only. A general procedure for the determination of the stability of a given steady state is outlined in Section 4 together with a determination of the stability of all steady states within a given parameter range in the forcing. It turns out that among the steady states which have energy in the wave components we find both stable and unstable configurations. It would thus appear that this result is in general agreement with the synoptic experience that some wave configurations can exist in a relatively unchanged form for a long time while others, presumably corresponding to the unstable configurations, will change rapidly. A close correspondence with real atmospheric conditions is impossible in a low-order system. The final part of Section 4 gives the result of some numerical experiments with the simple system to illustrate that the type of initial disturbance given to a steady, unstable state will determine the asymptotic steady state in a case where two or more such states exist. 1...|$|E
40|$|Background: Autogenous vein {{grafting}} {{is widely}} used in regular bypassing procedures. Due to its mismatch with the host artery in both mechanical property and geometry, the graft often over expands under high arterial blood pressure and forms a step-depth where <b>eddy</b> <b>flow</b> develops, thus causing restenosis, fibrous graft wall, etc. External stents, such as sheaths being used to cuff the graft, have been introduced to eliminate these mismatches and increase the patency. Although histological and immunochemical studies have shown some positive effects of the external stent, the mechanical mismatch {{under the protection of}} an external stent remains poorly analyzed. Methods: In this study, the jugular veins taken from hypercholesterolemic rabbits were transplanted into the carotid arteries, and non-woven polyglycolic acid (PGA) fabric was used to fabricate the external stents to study the effect of the biodegradable external stent. Eight weeks after the operation, the grafts were harvested to perform mechanical tests and histological examinations. An arc tangent function was suggested to describe the relationship between pressure and cross-sectional area to analyse the compliance of the graft. Results: The results from the mechanical tests indicated that grafts either with or without external stents displayed large compliance in the low-pressure range and were almost inextensible in the high-pressure range. This was very different from the behavior of the arteries or veins in vivo. The data from histological tests showed that, with external stents, collagen fibers were more compact, whilst those in the graft without protection were looser and thicker. No elastic fiber was found in either kind of grafts. Furthermore, grafts without protection were over-expanded which resulted in much bigger cross-sectional areas. Conclusion: The PGA external extent contributes little to the reduction of the mechanical mismatch between the graft and its host artery while remodeling develops. For the geometric mismatch, it reduces the cross-section area, therefore matching with the host artery much better. Although there are some positive effects, conclusively the PGA is not an ideal material for external stent...|$|E
60|$|Night {{with its}} fitful dreams passed. Dawn lifted the ebony gloom {{out of the}} cañon and {{sunlight}} far up on the ramparts renewed Shefford's spirit. He rose and awoke the others. Fay's wistful smile still held its faith. They ate of the gritty, water-soaked food. Then they embarked. The current carried them swiftly down and out of hearing of the last rapid. The character {{of the river and}} the cañon changed. The current lessened to a slow, smooth, silent, <b>eddying</b> <b>flow.</b> The walls grew straight, sheer, gloomy, and vast. Shefford noted these features, but he was listening so hard for the roar of the next rapid that he scarcely appreciated them. All the fugitives were listening. Every bend in the cañon--and now the turns were numerous--might hold a rapid. Shefford strained his ears. He imagined the low, dull, strange rumble. He had it in his ears, yet there was the growing sensation of silence.|$|R

High-frequency magnetic field applied to the conductive microbeads enables spin-valve giant magnetoresis-tance (SV-GMR) sensor to detect the magnetic fields occurred from <b>eddy</b> currents <b>flowing</b> in the conductive microbeads. In this paper, analysis of these magnetic fields by an analytical method is discussed and compared with experimental results. © 2005 IEEE...|$|R
