5|$|Quantum <b>gravity</b> is {{the branch}} of physics that seeks to {{describe}} <b>gravity</b> using the principles of quantum mechanics. Currently, the most popular approach to quantum <b>gravity</b> is string theory, which models elementary particles not as zero-dimensional points but as one-dimensional objects called strings. In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one typically considers theories of quantum <b>gravity</b> derived from string theory or its modern extension, M-theory.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of the radius and the mass of a star determines its surface <b>gravity.</b> Giant stars have a much lower surface <b>gravity</b> than do main sequence stars, while the opposite {{is the case for}} degenerate, compact stars such as white dwarfs. The surface <b>gravity</b> can influence the appearance of a star's spectrum, with higher <b>gravity</b> causing a broadening of the absorption lines.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} <b>Gravity</b> Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving, was {{announced}} {{as a reward}} for contributing to the Idle Thumbs podcast revival Kickstarter. The game was released to Kickstarter backers in July 2012, and later offered as a purchasable title on Steam, which included <b>Gravity</b> Bone as an additional feature. The game, though not a direct sequel in story to <b>Gravity</b> Bone, follows the main character in a heist with two other characters that goes very wrong. The title was critically acclaimed by reviewers, who called the very short but non-linear storytelling of Thirty Flights a novel use of the video game medium.|$|E
40|$|Critical <b>gravities</b> {{originated}} {{in the context of}} three-dimensional massive <b>gravities.</b> They were conjectured to describe gravitational duals of two-dimensional logarithmic conformal field theories. In this talk, we show that critical <b>gravities</b> can also be studied in dimensions d > 3. As in three dimensions, higher-dimensional critical <b>gravities</b> exhibit logarithmic modes. We argue that the existence of these logarithmic modes leads one to conjecture that higher-dimensional critical <b>gravities</b> are dual to logarithmic conformal field theories in more than two dimensions...|$|R

5|$|Analysis of the {{spectrum}} can also reveal the surface <b>gravity</b> of the star. This is usually expressed as log g, the base-10 logarithm of the gravitational acceleration given in CGS units, in this case, cm/s². Beta Pictoris has logg=4.15, implying a surface <b>gravity</b> of 140 m/s², which is {{about half of the}} gravitational acceleration at the surface of the Sun (274m/s²).|$|E
5|$|As a {{rotating}} proto-stellar disk contracts {{to form a}} star its shape {{becomes more and more}} spherical, but the contraction doesn't proceed all the way to a perfect sphere. At the poles all of the <b>gravity</b> acts to increase the contraction, but at the equator the effective <b>gravity</b> is diminished by the centrifugal force. The final shape of the star after star formation is an equilibrium shape, {{in the sense that the}} effective <b>gravity</b> in the equatorial region (being diminished) cannot pull the star to a more spherical shape. The rotation also gives rise to <b>gravity</b> darkening at the equator, as described by the von Zeipel theorem.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{that the}} {{equivalence}} principle holds, <b>gravity</b> influences {{the passage of}} time. Light sent down into a <b>gravity</b> well is blueshifted, whereas light sent {{in the opposite direction}} (i.e., climbing out of the <b>gravity</b> well) is redshifted; collectively, these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift. More generally, processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation.|$|E

5|$|Attempts {{to generalize}} {{ordinary}} quantum field theories, used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions, {{so as to}} include <b>gravity</b> have led to serious problems. Some have argued that at low energies, this approach proves successful, in that it results in an acceptable effective (quantum) field theory of <b>gravity.</b> At very high energies, however, the perturbative results are badly divergent and lead to models devoid of predictive power ("perturbative non-renormalizability").|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} work of J. D. Brown and Marc Henneaux in 1986, {{physicists}} have noticed that quantum <b>gravity</b> in a three-dimensional spacetime is closely related to two-dimensional conformal field theory. In 1995, Henneaux and his coworkers explored this relationship in more detail, suggesting that three-dimensional <b>gravity</b> in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to the conformal field theory known as Liouville field theory. Another conjecture formulated by Edward Witten states that three-dimensional <b>gravity</b> in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to a conformal field theory with monster group symmetry. These conjectures provide examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence that do not require the full apparatus of string or M-theory.|$|E
