40|$|DANALITE is the Fe 2 + end-member of the {{minerals}} of the <b>helvite</b> group, {{which have the}} general formula M 8 (BeSiO 4) 6 S 2, with M = (Mn,Fe 2 +,Zn). These minerals are relatively uncommon, although limited amounts are known at many localities round the world (e. g. Ragu, 1994; Larsen, 1988; Kwak and Jackson, 1986, and references therein). Their typical host rocks are skams, but occurrences in mineralized veins pegmatites, and altered alkali granites have also been reported. Danalite is rarer than <b>helvite</b> (Mn endmember) and genthelvite (Zn end-member) and, unlike the other two end-members, has never been found nor synthesized as a pure mineral (Mel'nikov et al., 1968). Hassan and Grundy (1985) demonstrated {{that there is no}} crystal-chemical reason for pure danalite not being stable and that complete miscibility should exist between the Mn, Fe, and Zn end-members. The apparently restricted stability of danalite in natural environments is probably controlled by sulphur and oxygen fugacities, danalite being replaced by pyrite- or pyrrhotite-bearing assemblages at high fs 2 and by magnetite-bearing assemblages at high fo 2 (Burt, 1980; Kwa k and Jackson, 1986). It follows that the association of danalite with magnetite, quartz, fayalite and/or pyrite (or pyrrhotite) may help to constrain petrogenetic conditions. Several works have addressed the chemical and physical properties of danalite (e. g. Kwak and Jackson, 1986, and references therein), but few crystal-chemical data have so far been produced. Pauling (1930) first recognized helvite-group minerals to be isotypic with sodalite, the (Mn,Fe,Zn), Be, and S atoms of <b>helvite</b> corresponding to the Na, A 1, and C 1 atoms of sodalite, respectively. Holloway et al. (1972) were the first to refne the structure of a <b>helvite</b> crystal. More recently, Hassan and Grundy (1985) reported structural data for six members of the <b>helvite</b> group, including two danalite samples from Western Australia and New Hampshire. In the present work we report the first finding of danalite from the Daba Shabeli Complex, Somalia, and provide new crystal-chemical data on a Fe 65 Mn 23 Zn 12 danalite sample from this locality...|$|E

40|$|Differential thermal {{analyses}} (DTA) and thermogravimetric analyses (TG) {{were carried}} out on sodalite, tugtupite, danalite, and <b>helvite</b> using a Netzsch STA 409 EP/ 3 /D simultaneous TG–DTA apparatus. In the DTA and TG experimental run, a weighed amount of finely powdered sample was heated from 20 to 1450 °C at a constant rate of 5 °C/min. Sodalite, Na 8 [Al 6 Si 6 O 24]Cl 2, melts at 1079 °C. The NaCl component in the sodalite-derived melt is lost in two stages; about 4. 5 wt. % of NaCl is lost slowly at about 1150 °C, and about 7. 0 wt. % of NaCl is lost {{at a faster rate}} at about 1284 °C. The interpretation that the NaCl component behaves this way in sodalite is confirmed by DTA and TG analyses of halite. Tugtupite, Na 8 [Al 2 Be 2 Si 8 O 24]Cl 2, melts at 1029 °C. The NaCl component in tugtupite is lost in two main stages; about 1. 8 wt. % of NaCl is first lost at about 1007 °C, and about 8. 2 wt. % of NaCl is lost in several steps between about 1018 and about 1442 °C. Danalite, ideally Fe 8 [Be 6 Si 6 O 24]S 2, and <b>helvite,</b> ideally Mn 8 [Be 6 Si 6 O 24]S 2, undergo an oxidation of (Mn, Fe) 2 + to (Mn, Fe) 3 + cations. This is followed by a loss of S 2 (g), and then melting at about 1060 °C. Finally, there is another oxidation of Mn 3 + to Mn 4 +. These oxidations occur because the samples were heated in a static air environment. The first oxidation in danalite and <b>helvite</b> begins at about 771 and 705 °C, respectively. Danalite gains 4. 0 wt. %, whereas <b>helvite</b> gains 5. 0 wt. % in the first weight-gain stage.

The second stage of oxidation begins at about 1300 °C in both the danalite- and helvite-derived melts.

Magnetic susceptibility data between 77 and 298 K have been measured for a natural <b>helvite</b> sample containing principally Mn 4 S+ 6 centers but with significant contamination from Mn 3 FeS+ 6 and Mn 3 CaS+ 6. The data exhibited Curie-Weiss behavior with [mu]eff = 5. 969 B. M. and [theta] = 178. 3 K.

40|$|The tin- bearing granites in the State of Goias, Brazil, form {{two groups}} of {{different}} ages: 1770 My for the Sucuri and Soledade massifs, 1658 - 1614 My. for the Serra Dourada, Serra da Mesa and Serra Branca massifs. The geology of the province suggests that these granites were emplaced in a rift context. The Sucuri and Soledade massifs are emplaced in gneisses of Archean age, the others massifs are intrusive in the Serra da Mesa Group, a sedimentary formation composed of pelites and greywackes. This Group was metamorphosed in the amphibolite facies (kyanite- almandine- biotite paragenesis). According to several thermobarometric tools, the temperature was around 540 °C and the pressure between 5 and 7 kBar. The age of the sediments {{is supposed to be}} lower Proterozoic, in accordance with the age proposed for the Serra Dourada massif (1653 My [...] The Serra Dourada massif is composed of four rock types. The petrographic, mineralogic observations and geochemical data reveal a main trend, composed of an amphibole- bearing facies, a biotite- bearing facies, and a fine grained porphyritic facies.. Garnet- bearing granites do not show any relations with the main trend. The contents of these granites in Nb, Y, Zr, Ce, La, Ga, and their MgO/TiO 2 ratio (around 1) {{are similar to those of}} the anorogenic granites of South Western United States and Gabo suite of Australia. However, niobium shows a compatible behaviour in Serra Dourada, in contrast to its incompatible behaviour in many anorogenic granites [...] . // [...] . The compositional variations of the beryllium minerals observed in skarns may be explained by the following processes : -either a late arrival of silica- rich solutions (high Si/Al ratio, presence of phenacite or <b>helvite)</b> within early formed alumina- rich parageneses (musgravite, chrysoberyl), - or a limited mobility of Al relatively to Si, which would induce a limited extension of the aluminous parageneses (musgravite, chrysoberyl). The activity of aluminum plays an essential role in the stability of the beryllium minerals : phenacite and/or <b>helvite</b> are stable when it is low, and beryl, chrysoberyl or musgravite when it is high. However, the increase of activity of other elements (Ca, Mn, Fe, Zn, alkalis) that would induce the formation of minerals incorporating alumina (garnet or felspars) would be unfavourable to the formation of beryl. <b>Helvite</b> is thus typically stable in calcic skarns, and it is associated with phenacite in the rocks submitted to alkaline metasomatism. Beryl, on the contrary, normally appears when acidic fluids separates from highly evolved granitic magmas (aplopegmatitic stage). The zonation of <b>helvite</b> crystals in albitites (genthelvite core, danalite border) reflects the decrease of alkalinity of the fluids. This zonation on the crystal scale is also observed on the outcrop scale: <b>helvite</b> composition varies from Ge 64 Da 10 He 26 in the internal zone to Ge 23 Da 50 He 26, in the external zone. The same variation is observed in an albitized siderophyllite vein, from Ge 25 Da 42 He 33 in a slightly albitized zone to Ge 55 Da 39 He 22 in a highly albitized one. The formation of genthelvite is favoured, as compared with the other members of the <b>helvite</b> group, by alkaline conditions. The compositional variations of <b>helvite</b> in the Sucuri massif would result from variations in fs 2 and f 02, in the fluids. Genthelvite is stable under alkaline and oxidizing conditions. Les granites stannifères de l'état de Goias forment deux groupes d'âge different. Les massifs de Sucuri et de Soledade ont un âge de 1770 Ma et les massifs de Serra Dourada, Serra da Mesa et Serra Branca ont respectivement 1653, 1614 et 1658 Ma. La géologie de cette province conduit à situer la mise en place de ces granites dans la zone de Rift. Les éléments traces Nb, Y, Zr, Ce, La et Ga et le rapport MgO/TiO 2 sont comparables à ceux des granites anorogéniques du sud-ouest des Etats-Unis et de la suite de Gabo en Australie. Les valeurs faibles du rapport Zr/Hf (23 à 28) des massifs étudiés permettent d'exclure une origine directe par fusion partielle, le rapport crustal par fusion est compris entre 30 et 40. La zonalité minéralogique (bordure à biotite et coeur à pyroxène) des lentilles à pyroxène du gisement de Mata Azul (massif de Serra Dourada) traduit le caractère métasomatique de ces roches et rappelle celles des endoskarns. Les études pétrographiques, minéralogiques et géochimiques ont mis en évidence l'importance du rôle du calcium et de la fugacité d'oxygène.

40|$|The Little Nahanni rare-element {{granitic}} pegmatite group (LNPG; ca. 82 Ma) in {{the western}} part of the Northwest Territories, occurs as subparallel dike swarms over an area of ~ 11 5 km in the walls of a series of cirques dominated by schists of the Upper Proterozoic Hyland Group. These pegmatite bodies, up to a few meter wide, are divisible into spodumene-bearing and spodumene-free varieties that occur close together; some dikes split into these two variants. The two types are mineralogically similar. Both contain K-feldspar, plagioclase, quartz, mica (muscovite to lepidolite), columbite-group minerals, cassiterite, tourmaline, beryl, lithiophilite and garnet; they differ in the abundance of mica and accessory phases. The spodumene-free pegmatites have more mica, particularly lepidolite, than the spodumene-bearing variety. Apatite and montebrasite occur primarily in the former, whereas most lithiophilite is present in the latter. Sparse galena, titanian rutile, fluorite and <b>helvite</b> are also found in both variants.

Magnetic and polarized neutron experiments show that the interactions within the tetrahedral metal clusters of divalent ions are predominantly antiferromagnetic. In the sulphide, the clusters behave as totally isolated clusters showing no magnetic interaction across the cages.

40|$|The Rosebery deposit {{in western}} Tasmania is a polymetallic massive sulfide deposit hosted in felsic volcanics of the Cambrian Mount Read Volcanic belt. The deposit {{underwent}} upper greenschist facies regional metamorphism and related deformation during the Devonian Tabberabberan orogeny, resulting in folding, shearing, and faulting (thrusting) of the ore lenses. The {{south end of}} the Rosebery deposit has undergone metasomatic replacement related to a postorogenic Devonian granitoid pluton, whose existence is inferred from geophysical (gravity) data. Metasomatic mineral assemblages related to this pluton have been recognized transgressing Cambrian volcanic-hosted massive sulfide minerals at the {{south end of the}} Rosebery orebody. Cambrian volcanic-hosted massive sulfide mineralization at Rosebery consists of three primary zones: a lowermost pyrite-chalcopyrite zone, overlain by a sphalerite-galena ± pyrite zone, and further overlain by a massive barite ± carbonate zone. Three major Devonian replacement zones are also present (1) a magnetite-biotite ± chalcopyrite zone, (2) a pyrrhotite-pyrite zone, and (3) a tourmaline-quartz ± magnetite zone. Minerals such as fluorite, gamet, and <b>helvite</b> are also present in the replacement zones. Metal zonation studies indicate that zinc occurs dominantly in a blanketlike enrichment zone in the primary sulfide lenses of the Rosebery deposit. Gold is largely concentrated at the top of the ore lenses. In the transgressive pyrrhotite-pyrite replacement zone {{at the south end of}} the Rosebery deposit, zinc is conspicuously depleted but gold concentrations of more than 20 glt are observed. In contrast, the biotite-, magnetite-, and tourmalinebearing replacement zones contain low gold grades (generally less than 5. 0 glt Au).

40|$|The pyrometasomatic {{deposits}} at Iron Mountain, {{near the}} northern end of the Sierra Cuchillo in Sierra and Socorro Counties, New Mexico, have been formed through replacement of calcareous beds of Paleozoic age, generally at or near contacts with intrusive masses of rhyolite, rhyolite porphyry, aplite, and fine-grained granite. The metamorphism is probably mid-Tertiary in age. Its two chief products are (a) light-colored, dense, fine-grained granulites rich in diopside, clinozoisite, bytownite, and other iron-poor silicate minerals, and (b) coarser-grained, dark-colored, iron-rich rocks, called tactites. The spatial and temporal relations of these iron-poor and iron-rich contact rocks, not only to each other but to adjacent igneous bodies and to relatively unmetamorphosed beds, appear to have been determined in a regular and definite manner; this is discussed and illustrated in detail by several examples. The iron-rich pyrometasomatic deposits contain a large number of unusual minerals. Most remarkable are <b>helvite</b> and at least three other beryllium-bearing silicate minerals, which are known to occur in noteworthy concentrations in only one type of rock, a peculiar rhythmically layered variety of tactite to which the name "ribbon rock" has been given. The structure of such tactite is very conspicuous, and appears in section as thin, finely crenulated bands of magnetite alternating with similar bands of silicate minerals and finely crystalline fluorite. Concentric banding about fluorite-rich pods is common. Bodies of "ribbon rock" vary in size from inch-thick lenses to large masses amounting to thousands of tons; most appear to have formed along contacts between recrystallized limestone and massive magnetite-andradite tactite, chiefly by replacing fluids penetrating the limestone from fractures. The layered structure is interpreted as a diffusion effect. The formation of massive and "ribbon rock" tactites can be traced through a range of falling temperatures from a stage characterized by deposition from iron-rich vapors to a stage in which hydrothermal solutions were dominant. Both vapors and liquids appear to have been acid, and reducing conditions undoubtedly existed during {{the latter part of the}} hydrothermal stage. The occurrence of beryllium in "ribbon rock", but not in typical massive tactite may signify that its compounds in pyrometasomatic deposits are confined to rocks of hydrothermal origin. The occurrence of "ribbon rock" itself is suggested as a potentially useful clue for recognition of beryllium-bearing contact deposits elsewhere; at least two other occurrences of what apparently is "ribbon rock" have been described in the literature...|$|E

Most pegmatites show a simple mineral assemblage consisting of K-feldspar, quartz, and muscovite ± biotite, and only a minor percentage of the dikes (< 5 %) contains Sn-Nb-Ta-Y-REE-U oxide, Y-REE phosphate, Mn-Fe-phosphate, Ti-Zr-silicate, Be-Y-REE-U-silicate and oxide minerals (beryl, chrysoberyl, bertrandite, bavenite, and milarite), garnet (almandine-spessartine), tourmaline (schorl to rare elbaite), bismuthinite, magnetite, and rarely dumortierite and <b>helvite.</b> The mineral assemblages, geological context, and chemical compositions allow the distinction between LCT (lithium, cesium, tantalum) and mixed LCT-NYF (niobium, yttrium, fluorine) pegmatites (with only one exception of an NYF dike in the Bodengo area). The LCT pegmatites of the Central Alps did not reach {{a high degree of}} geochemical evolution. The most fractionated pegmatites are found in the Codera area and contain Mn-rich elbaite, triplite, pink-beryl, and Cs-Rb-rich feldspar. In the Bodengo area pegmatites locally contain miarolitic cavities and the most evolved pegmatites correspond to the beryl-columbite-phosphate type. From a structural point of view two main types of pegmatites can be distinguished: (1) pegmatites that were involved in ductile deformation and (2) pegmatites that postdated the main ductile deformation of the SSB. Many pegmatites of the Codera valley belong to the first structural type: they were emplaced at relatively high ambient temperature (ca. 500 °C) and locally show a pervasive recrystallization of quartz and a mylonitic structure. The Codera dikes trend about 70 ° and are steeply dipping. In the Bodengo area the main set of pegmatites (trending approximately N–S to NNE–SSW) crosscuts the ductile deformation structures of the SSB, but the area also includes an earlier generation of boudinaged and folded pegmatite dikes. The undeformed pegmatites from this area may contain miarolitic pockets. There is no systematic difference in the mineral assemblage between the two structural types of pegmatites. However, the chemistry of pegmatite minerals, especially of garnet, in addition to field data suggests that the dikes of the Codera and Bodengo areas represent two distinct generations of pegmatites. Structural data and the few existing radiometric ages suggest that pegmatites were emplaced over a time span between 29 and 25 Ma (and possibly as young as 20 Ma), with the youngest dikes postdating the ductile deformations of the Alpine nappes. The present work presents a first comprehensive field description and geochemical – mineralogical characterization of the Alpine pegmatite field of the Central Alps...|$|E
