5|$|Matt meets Elektra Natchios, {{daughter}} of Nikolas Natchios, a businessman who has dealings with Wilson Fisk, a rich executive {{who is also}} the criminal leader known as the Kingpin.

Matt tries to stop Bullseye, but Bullseye ultimately succeeds in killing Nikolas and framing Matt in the process. Elektra vows to exact revenge, while reporter Ben Urich discovers his secret identity. Believing Matt to have done <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> Hell's Kitchen, Urich tells Matt that Bullseye is going after Elektra next.|$|E
500|$|Opposition Leader Pearson stated, [...] "He {{was a man}} who shirked no duty, faltered in no task, was daunted by no obstacle. He {{got things}} done, and they were <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> the country he served so well and so long." ...|$|E
500|$|Biographer Stephen Murray-Smith is {{more generous}} in his {{assessment}} of Selfe's contribution to education debates {{around the turn of}} the twentieth century: [...] "Selfe went beyond the concept of helping the working man to achieve a share of the good things hitherto reserved for others, towards the concept of leading him to create <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> himself." ...|$|E
50|$|I {{think this}} beast, this cycle way, is {{exceeding}} anybody's expectations {{of what it}} possibly could have done. Which is a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> the community and a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> the businesses along the way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if {{you feel}} that way, Tom, why don't you break away and go? I think, perhaps, it would be not only a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> Dick, but it would, also, be a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> you," [...] and, for the moment, Sam looked very seriously at his brother.|$|R
60|$|Another {{idea arose}} {{in the minds of}} the wisest British statesmen. If {{prohibitive}} warfare were a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> America, it would be an equally <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> England. More than that, it would be a better thing if only these two countries possessed the power of waging prohibitive warfare.|$|R
500|$|A choral {{movement}} confirms [...] "" [...] (The Lord {{has done}} <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> us). The movement is structured like a da capo aria, with a fugue {{in the opening}} and repeat, while the contrasting middle section is mostly homophonic. A a long ritornello theme features an [...] "imperious" [...] trumpet melody, which is played four times during the movement. The voices enter from the lowest to the highest, then additional instruments lead to a climax. In the middle section motifs from the ritornello are played [...] "above and between" [...] the voices. One fanfare motif appears also in Bach's first Brandenburg Concerto and would later {{be used in the}} bass aria [...] in the Christmas Oratorio. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann assumes, reflecting its secular character as a hunting signal and fanfare, that the movement is derived from an earlier homage cantata.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times complimented {{the song}} {{and said that the}} song [...] "tells <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> this winter's blockbuster-to-be. It's not a reimagining or a musical departure, but simply a righting of the ship. The song is big, bold and seems to have a little spot-o-fun". MTV was also positive, stating that [...] "Adele's lush song fits right in with {{classics}} by Shirley Bassey, Paul McCartney and Carly Simon". The Wall Street Journal felt similarly, writing that the song [...] "has sweep and drama, [...] orchestral support [...] gives it a classical timelessness that sets it apart from typical pop songs. Because it is a theme for a Bond film, after all, the song is also shot through with the threat of violence and death". E! Online wrote that Adele's song was [...] "a cross, and a good one at that, between the 1971 Bassey classic and a more-focused version of Garbage's 'The World Is Not Enough'." [...] The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the song [...] "instantly feels like a Bond theme, with the singer's sultry voice set against a minor chord progression. Done in big, orchestral style, the mood – like the singer – is all 1960s throwback, back when Bond themes like 'Goldfinger' were smooth, seductive and larger than life".|$|E
2500|$|The Perry Mason novels {{inspired}} Robert M. Bell, former Chief Judge of the Maryland Court of Appeals, {{to become}} a lawyer. [...] "I used to read those growing up", he recalled in 2012. [...] "I got the sense that a lawyer could do <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> folk and was important to our community. That’s what I wanted to do." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{they were}} through {{laughing}} Nimbleheels answered Old Mother Nature's questions. He {{explained that he}} had heard about that school, as by this time almost every one in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadows had. By chance he learned that Danny Meadow Mouse was attending. He thought that if it was a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> Danny it would be a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> him, so he had come.|$|R
60|$|LORD GORING. Life {{is never}} fair, Robert. And {{perhaps it is}} a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> most of us that it is not.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{it will be}} a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> Cuthbert Hartington after all," [...] she said, {{after sitting}} for some minutes in silence.|$|R
2500|$|Morning Musume's last single of 2005 was [...] "", {{which was}} a remake of a {{previous}} album-only song {{about the importance of}} using your intuition and not taking <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> granted. [...] "Koi wa Hassō Do The Hustle!" [...] {{was going to be the}} title track for the single, but due to poor preview results, became the coupling track instead.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the spring}} race, Busch {{got into an}} {{incident}} with former Penske teammate Brad Keselowski. On pit road, Keselowski slowed in front of Busch, trying to avoid Kasey Kahne. Busch did not slow down in time and rear-ended Keselowski, causing severe damage to the racecar. Keselowski was upset by the collision and criticized Busch {{in an interview in}} the garages. On lap 87, Keselowski and Busch encountered each other on the track with Keselowski over forty laps down and Kurt running in fourth place. Keselowski tried to retaliate by bumping Busch repetitively until NASCAR officials and Keselowski's boss Roger Penske told Keselowski to go to the garage and take a long time-out for his antics. Despite this altercation, Busch {{went on to win the}} race while Keselowski finished 39th. Post-race, Keselowski was quoted as stating, [...] "Kurt does <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> charity and is such a talent but he is the dumbest racer." [...] Busch replied hours later in a media conference by calling Keselowski's retaliatory moves [...] "Punk-ass moves." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'Tis a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> the feller," [...] said Humphrey. [...] "A {{sight of}} times {{better to be}} selling diments than nobbling about here." ...|$|R

60|$|He {{had tried}} four keys without success, {{when he saw}} a waiter {{approaching}} with a trayful of <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> a late supper in a nearby apartment. At once he moved away down the hallway and did not return until the servant had disappeared from view.|$|E
6000|$|Reddy Fox is very, very cunning, and his crafty brain {{had been}} busily {{working out a}} plan to get all these <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> himself.

6000|$|... "Please don't think me rude or unkind," [...] she pleaded. [...] "Don't {{even think}} that I don't like your coming along with us--because I do. It isn't that. Only, as I {{told my father}} before supper, you don't belong! You {{ought not to be}} seen at these places, and with us. For some absurd reason father seems to have taken a fancy to you. It isn't a very <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> you. It very likely won't be a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> us." ...|$|R

[...] "Yet remember, Nephew, that if you live to reach it, a day will come when yours will be as mine is. Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher, all is vanity!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It may {{be those}} are <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> us. No! This {{is just a}} lark as yet, Marjorie. It's still fresh and full of distractions. The discomforts are amusing. Presently we'll get used to it. Then we'll talk out--what {{we have to talk}} out.... I say, wouldn't it keep and improve this goose of ours if we put in a little brandy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} have mentioned," [...] she resumed, [...] "that I shall make you a present of the bill, receipted, on the {{conclusion}} of the ceremony. You will be taken to the ship in my own boat, with all your money in your pockets, and a hamper of <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> the mess. After that I wash my hands of you. You may go to the devil your own way." ...|$|E

60|$|About {{two hours}} after he was gone, came a Leadenhall basket-woman, with a whole load of <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> the mouth (the {{particulars}} are not to the purpose), and brought orders to get supper by eight o'clock. However, I {{did not intend to}} begin to dress anything till I saw him; and he gave me time enough, for he came before seven, so that Amy, who had gotten one to help her, got everything ready in time.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right. I {{like to see}} a {{young woman}} with an appetite. Remember that God sends the <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> us to eat; and as long as we don't take more than our share, and give away {{something}} to those who haven't a fair share of their own, I for one think it quite right to enjoy my victuals.
