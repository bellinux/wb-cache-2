40|$|Economic {{research}} {{offers two}} traditional ways of analyzing decision making under risk. One {{option is to}} compare the goodness of fit of different <b>decision</b> <b>theories</b> using the same model of stochastic choice. An alternative way is to vary models of stochastic choice combining them with {{only one or two}} <b>decision</b> <b>theories.</b> This paper proposes to look at the bigger picture by comparing different combinations of <b>decision</b> <b>theories</b> and models of stochastic choice. We select a menu of seven popular <b>decision</b> <b>theories</b> and embed each theory in five models of stochastic choice including tremble, Fechner and random utility model. We find that the estimated parameters of <b>decision</b> <b>theories</b> differ significantly when theories are combined with different models. Depending on the selected model of stochastic choice we obtain different ranking of <b>decision</b> <b>theories</b> with regard to their goodness of fit to the data. The fit of all analyzed <b>decision</b> <b>theories</b> improves significantly when they are embedded in a Fechner model of heteroscedastic truncated errors (or random utility model in a dynamic decision problem).

25|$|Bayesian <b>decision</b> <b>theory</b> {{can be used}} {{in looking}} at pricing decisions. Field {{information}} such as retail and wholesale prices as well as the size of the market and market share are all incorporated into the prior information. Managerial judgement is included in order to evaluate different pricing strategies. This method of evaluating possible pricing strategies does have its limitations as it requires a number of assumptions to be made about the market place in which an organisation operates. As markets are dynamic environments {{it is often difficult to}} fully apply Bayesian <b>decision</b> <b>theory</b> to pricing strategies without simplifying the model.|$|E
25|$|Historically, Pascal's Wager was {{groundbreaking}} {{because it}} charted new territory in probability theory, {{marked the first}} formal use of <b>decision</b> <b>theory,</b> and anticipated future philosophies such as existentialism, pragmatism and voluntarism.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a puzzling conflict between two positions that are each compelling: (A) it is irrational for an agent {{to pay to}} avoid ‘free’ evidence before making a decision, and (B) rational agents may have imprecise beliefs and/or desires. Indeed, we show that Good’s theorem Good (1967) concerning the invariable choice-worthiness of free evidence does not generalise to the imprecise realm, given the plausible existing <b>decision</b> <b>theories</b> for handling imprecision. A key ingredient in the analysis, and a potential source of controversy, is the general approach taken for resolving sequential decision problems – we make explicit what the key alternatives are and defend our own approach. Furthermore, we endorse {{a resolution of the}} aforementioned puzzle – we privilege <b>decision</b> <b>theories</b> that merely permit avoiding free evidence over <b>decision</b> <b>theories</b> for which avoiding free evidence is uniquely admissible. Finally, we situate this particular result about free evidence within the broader ‘dynamic-coherence’ literature...|$|R

However, the converse is false. Prospect theory {{has been used to}} explain a range of phenomena that existing <b>decision</b> <b>theories</b> have great difficulty in explaining.

25|$|Other formal {{sciences}} include information theory, systems theory, <b>decision</b> <b>theory</b> {{and theoretical}} linguistics.

25|$|In the {{philosophy}} of <b>decision</b> <b>theory,</b> a fundamental question is: From the standpoint of statistical outcomes, {{to what extent do}} the choices of a conscious being have the ability to influence the future?

25|$|One naïve Bayesian {{approach}} to hypothesis testing is to base {{decisions on the}} posterior probability, but this fails when comparing point and continuous hypotheses. Other approaches to decision making, such as Bayesian <b>decision</b> <b>theory,</b> attempt to balance the consequences of incorrect decisions across all possibilities, rather than concentrating on a single null hypothesis. A number of other approaches to reaching a decision based on data are available via <b>decision</b> <b>theory</b> and optimal decisions, {{some of which have}} desirable properties. Hypothesis testing, though, is a dominant {{approach to}} data analysis in many fields of science. Extensions to the theory of hypothesis testing include the study of the power of tests, i.e. the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is false. Such considerations can be used for the purpose of sample size determination prior to the collection of data.|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews {{studies on}} eye {{movements}} in decision making, and compares their observations to theoretical predictions concerning {{the role of}} attention in decision making. Four <b>decision</b> <b>theories</b> are examined: rational models, bounded rationality, evidence accumulation, and parallel constraint satisfaction models. Although most theories were confirmed with regard to certain predictions, none of the theories adequately accounted {{for the role of}} attention during decision making. Several observations emerged concerning the drivers and down-stream effects of attention on choice, suggesting that attention processes plays an active role in constructing decisions. So far, <b>decision</b> <b>theories</b> have largely ignored the constructive role of attention by assuming that it is entirely determined by heuristics, or that it consists of stochastic information sampling. The empirical observations reveal that these assumptions are implausible, and that more accurate assumptions could have been made based on prior attention and eye movement research. Future decision making research would benefit from greater integration with attention research. ...|$|R

25|$|Fisher's {{significance}} {{testing has}} proven a popular flexible statistical tool in application with little mathematical growth potential. Neyman–Pearson hypothesis testing is claimed as {{a pillar of}} mathematical statistics, creating a new paradigm for the field. It also stimulated new applications in statistical process control, detection theory, <b>decision</b> <b>theory</b> and game theory. Both formulations have been successful, but the successes have been of a different character.|$|E
25|$|In <b>decision</b> <b>theory,</b> the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem shows that, {{under certain}} axioms of {{rational}} behavior, a decision-maker faced with risky (probabilistic) outcomes of different choices will behave {{as if he}} is maximizing the expected value of some function defined over the potential outcomes at some specified point in the future. This function is known as the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function. The theorem is the basis for expected utility theory.|$|E

It considers this gap by discussing studies of compensatory education programs and mandates. The inconclusive findings regarding identifying effective programs led to an exploration of <b>decision</b> making <b>theories</b> and persistence to maintain ineffective programs. This information guided the purpose of this study: to explore why decision makers continue an "irrational" course of action. Through application of the <b>decision</b> making <b>theories</b> of Escalation, Sunk-cost and Prospect, this study explored the rationale of decision makers at two California schools, with ineffective programs, via interviews and scenarios.

Applied mathematicians and statisticians often work in a department of mathematical sciences (particularly at colleges and small universities).|$|E
25|$|Emotion {{and social}} skills are {{important}} to an intelligent agent for two reasons. First, being able to predict the actions of others by understanding their motives and emotional states allow an agent to make better decisions. Concepts such as game theory, <b>decision</b> <b>theory,</b> necessitate that an agent {{be able to detect}} and model human emotions. Second, in an effort to facilitate human–computer interaction, an intelligent machine may want to display emotions (even if it does not experience those emotions itself) to appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction.|$|E
