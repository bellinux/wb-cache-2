5000|$|MDEA is less {{reactive}} towards CO2, but has an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>loading</b> capacity approaching 1 mole CO2 per mole amine. It {{also requires}} less energy to regenerate. To combine {{the advantages of}} MDEA and the smaller amines, MDEA is usually mixed with a catalytic promoter such as piperazine, PZ, or a fast reacting amine such as MEA to retain reactivity, but lower regeneration costs. Activated MDEA or aMDEA uses piperazine as a catalyst {{to increase the speed}} of the reaction with CO2. It has been commercially successful. Many tests have been conducted on the performance of MDEA/MEA or MDEA/Piperazine mixtures compared to single amines. CO2 production rates were higher than MEA for the same heat duty and total molar concentration when experiments were performed in the University of Regina pilot plant, which is a modeled after a natural gas plant. There were also insignificant trace amounts of degradation products detected. [...] However, when the same control variables and tests were conducted at the Boundary Dam plant, the CO2 production rate for the mixed solvent was lower than MEA. [...] This was a result of the reduction in the capacity of the solvent to absorb CO2 after degradation. Because the Boundary Dam plant is a coal-fired power plant, it operates under harsher environments and produces an impure flue gas containing, fly ash, SO2, and NO2 that are fed into carbon capture. Even with flue gas pretreatment, there is still enough to produce degradation products such as straight chain amines and sulfur compounds, which accumulate so it is no longer possible to regenerate MEA and MDEA. [...] For these blends to be successful in reducing heat duty, their chemical stabilities must be maintained.|$|E

25|$|A load on a {{framework}} {{is a system}} of forces on the vertices (represented as vectors). A stress is a special case of a load, in which equal and opposite forces are applied to the two endpoints of each edge (which may be imagined as a spring) and the forces formed in this way are added at each vertex. Every stress is an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>load,</b> a load that does not impose any translational force on the whole system (the sum of its force vectors is zero) nor any rotational force. A linear dependence among the rows of the rigidity matrix may be represented as a self-stress, an assignment of equal and opposite forces to the endpoints of each edge that is not identically zero but that adds to zero at every vertex. Thus, a set of edges forms an independent set in the rigidity matroid {{if and only if}} it has no self-stress.|$|R

In this paper, we characterize and calculate the best possible Zig-Zag policy, and argue that simple system-throttling rules are often optimal.

In particular, we consider the case where the processor can operate only at a few discrete states; thus it is required to alternate between cooling and heating phases. In such a setting, we develop an algorithm that outperforms all other Zig-Zag policies, and present computational experiments emphasizing the performance of our algorithm. ...|$|R

With energy storage, there is a possibility to generate more energy when the demand is low and store it for later use. In this paper, we study a dynamic optimal power flow problem with energy storage dynamics in purely resistive power networks. By exploiting a recently-discovered zero duality gap property in the optimal power flow (OPF) problem, we apply optimization decomposition techniques to decouple the coupling energy storage constraints and obtain the global optimal solution using distributed message passing algorithms.

We distinguish between the hydrostatic pressure acting on the interstitial fluid and the pore pressure acting on the cartilage fibril network. Our results show that properties related to the pore matrix microstructure such as diffusion and hydraulic conductivity are strongly influenced by the hydrostatic pressure in the interstitial fluid of the dynamically deforming cartilage which differ significantly from the properties measured under static i. e. <b>equilibrium</b> <b>loading</b> conditions (when the hydrostatic pressure has relaxed back to zero). The magnitude of the hydrostatic fluid pressure also appears to affect the way cartilage's pore matrix changes during deformation with implications for the diffusion and flow-driven fluid transport through the deforming pore matrix. We also show strong evidence for a highly anisotropic pore structure and deformational dynamics that allows cartilage to deform without significantly altering the axial porosity of the matrix even at very large strains. The insensitivity of the axial porosity to compressive strain may be playing a critical function in directing the flow of pressurized interstitial fluid in the compressed cartilage to the surface, to support the load, and provide a protective interfacial fluid film that 'weeps' out from the deforming tissue and thereby enhances the (elasto) hydrodynamic efficacy of sliding joints. Our results appear to show a close synergy between the structure of cartilage and both the hydrodynamic and boundary lubrication mechanisms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Exchange equilibria recorded {{for a range of}} different solution normalities revealed profiles which were represented by conventional “L” or “H” type isotherms at low values of equilibrium concentration (Ce) of calcium ions, plus a superimposed region of increasing calcium uptake was observed at high Ce values. The loading of calcium ions was determined to be ca. 53. 5 to 58. 7 g/kg of resin when modelling only the sorption curve created at low Ce values,which exhibited a well-defined plateau. The calculated calcium ion loading capacity for DOWMAC- 3 resin appeared to correlate with the manufacturer's recommendation. The phenomenon of super equivalent ion exchange (SEIX) was observed when the “driving force” for the exchange process was increased in excess of 2. 25 mmol calcium ions per gram of resin in the starting solution. This latter event was explained in terms of displacement of sodium ions from sodium hydroxide solution which remained in the resin bead following the initial conversion of the as supplied “H+” exchanged resin sites to the “Na+” version required for softening studies. Evidence for hydrolysis of {{a small fraction of the}} sites on the sodium exchanged resin surface was noted.

The membranes were prepared by grafting poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(itaconic acid) (PIA) to cellulose nanofiber mats. Performance measurements quantified the dynamic ion-exchange capacity for cadmium (Cd), productivity, and recovery of Cd(II) from the membranes by regeneration. The dynamic binding capacities of Cd(II) on both types of nanofiber membrane were independent of the linear flow velocity, with a residence time of as low as 2 s. Analysis of breakthrough curves indicated that the mass flow rate increased rapidly at constant applied pressure after membranes approached <b>equilibrium</b> <b>load</b> capacity for Cd(II), apparently due to a collapse of the polymer chains on the membrane surface, leading to an increased porosity. This mechanism is supported by hydrodynamic radius (Rh) measurements for PAA and PIA obtained from dynamic light scattering, which show that Rh values decrease upon Cd(II) binding. Volumetric productivity was high for the nanofiber membranes, and reached 0. 55 mg Cd/g/min.
