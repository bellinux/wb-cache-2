Further comparison of the canned fish that contain high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids show that although this is a canned species, the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids exceeds that of some terrestrial animal products such as Thai fermented pork sausage that contains only 0.01g/100g DHA, with no EPA being detected at all.|$|E

The most important seafood products imported to the U. S. are shrimp, Atlantic salmon, tilapia, catfish, crayfish, mussels and a mixture of mollusks. In 2003, the U.

This study investigates the degree of market integration between fresh farmed tilapia fillets and <b>fresh</b> <b>fillets</b> of farmed catfish, wild sea dab, wild blackback flounder, and wild whole fresh red snapper in the US market. The literature suggests farmed and wild fish of alternative species do not compete. However, this may be changing as new farmed species are introduced to new markets. The results indicate no relationship between prices of fresh tilapia and catfish. Hence, {{there is no evidence that}} fresh tilapia fillets compete in the same market as catfish fillets. Conversely, fresh farmed tilapia fillets compete with wild whole red snapper, wild <b>fresh</b> <b>fillets</b> of sea dab, and blackback flounder. The implications are important for managing these overexploited wild fish species, as prices will most likely decline with increased imports of fresh tilapia fillets.

Generally, the order of effectiveness for inhibiting oxidation in sturgeon fillets was found to be: 5 % TE or OJ = 2. 5 % TE> 2. 5 % OJ> 1 % TE = 1 % OJ. Based on sensory scores, higher amounts of onion juice (> 1 %) were more effective to improve attributive characteristics of the fillets...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine the effect of Pistia stratiotes extract on the shelf life of Pangasius fillet during storage at low temperature. The research used Factorial Randomized Design (FRD) with two factors and two replications. The first factor was the difference immersion Pangasius <b>fillet</b> <b>fresh</b> consist Pangasius <b>fillet</b> with immersion Pistia strtiotes extract (A 0), Pangasius fillet with immersion Pistia stratiotes extract (A 1) and storage time 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 days. The parameters observed were weight loss, whiteness, peroxide value pH, Total Volatile (TVB), and Total Plate Count (TPC). The results showed that the difference immersion of Pistia stratiotes fillet significant effect (p< 0. 05) to the value of weight loss, it is suspected because of the polyphenolic compounds in the Pistia stratiotes extract is capable of inhibiting the enzyme activity of the meat. Whereas, the difference in storage time significantly affected weight loss, peroxide value, TVB, and TPC. Pangasius fillets with immersion Pistia strtiotes extract still fit for consumption until the 25 th da...|$|R
40|$|Near {{infrared}} reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) {{analysis was used}} to predict proximate chemical composition and identify the rearing system of 236 European sea bass caught in four Italian fish farms (extensive ponds, semi-intensive ponds, intensive tanks and intensive sea-cages). Three types of sample preparation (intact <b>fillet</b> portions; whole <b>fresh</b> minced fillet; freeze-dried minced fillet) were compared. NIRS provided good reliability in the prediction of chemical composition of sea bass fillets but weaker results in crude protein prediction. NIRS prediction of chemical composition proved to be more accurate with <b>fresh</b> minced <b>fillets</b> than intact fillet portions. The merely slight improvement of NIRS accuracy with freeze-dried samples did not justify the latter treatment, which was necessary, however, to obtain reliable information on the sea bass rearing system...|$|R
40|$|Spectral {{effects of}} {{microbial}} growth, packaging atmosphere and heme oxidation were investigated with fresh salmon. The presence of microorganisms and their growth have {{little effect on}} the development of spectral features in fresh salmon during storage prior to extensive spoilage. Important spectral changes occur at 606 and 636 nm in the spectra of fresh salmon during storage. Heme oxidation is the primary source of spectral changes occurring at 636 nm in <b>fresh</b> salmon <b>fillets</b> during air storage. The origin of the shoulder peak appearing at 606 nm is absorption due to water in the salmon muscle. The spectral variations at 606 nm depend on the dominant oxidation state of heme in the muscle and the change in the visibility of the water shoulder peak in the spectrum...|$|R
