5|$|As various {{agreements}} were reached, {{activities in}} Luxembourg gradually shifted to Brussels and the Parliament, although bound {{to remain in}} Strasbourg, also started to work <b>in</b> <b>Brussels</b> while the courts remained in Luxembourg. The final agreement in 1992 set up the present arrangement, including {{the division of the}} Parliament's work between the three cities. In 2002, the European Council, having previously rotated between different cities, decided to base itself <b>in</b> <b>Brussels.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} institutions, the Parliament's seat {{was not yet}} fixed. The {{provisional}} arrangements placed Parliament in Strasbourg, while the Commission and Council had their seats <b>in</b> <b>Brussels.</b> In 1985 the Parliament, wishing {{to be closer to}} these institutions, built a second chamber <b>in</b> <b>Brussels</b> and moved some of its work there despite protests from some states. A final agreement was eventually reached by the European Council in 1992. It stated the Parliament would retain its formal seat in Strasbourg, where twelve sessions a year would be held, but with all other parliamentary activity <b>in</b> <b>Brussels.</b> This two-seat arrangement was contested by the Parliament, but was later enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam. To this day the institution's locations are a source of contention.|$|E

5|$|The European Commission {{also has}} its seat <b>in</b> <b>Brussels,</b> {{although}} some departments are hosted by Luxembourg. The European Court of Justice, the General Court, and the Court of Auditors are based in Luxembourg along with the European Investment Bank.

5|$|The {{institutions}} are not concentrated {{in a single}} capital city: instead, their headquarters are spread across four cities, Brussels, Luxembourg, Strasbourg and Frankfurt. The current arrangement was approved in 1992 and attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam. The treaty states that the Commission and Council would be based <b>in</b> <b>Brussels,</b> the Courts in Luxembourg and the Parliament in Strasbourg. However some departments of the Commission and meetings of the Council take place in Luxembourg, while the Parliament has its committees and some sessions <b>in</b> <b>Brussels</b> and its secretariat in Luxembourg. Of the new institutions, the Central Bank is based in Frankfurt while the European Council is based <b>in</b> <b>Brussels</b> (but has some extraordinary meetings elsewhere).|$|E

5|$|Unable {{either to}} stay in France or to move to Germany, Marx decided to emigrate to Brussels in Belgium in February 1845. However, {{to stay in}} Belgium he had to pledge not to publish {{anything}} {{on the subject of}} contemporary politics. <b>In</b> <b>Brussels,</b> Marx associated with other exiled socialists from across Europe, including Moses Hess, Karl Heinzen and Joseph Weydemeyer. In April 1845, Engels moved from Barmen in Germany to Brussels to join Marx and the growing cadre of members of the League of the Just now seeking home <b>in</b> <b>Brussels.</b> Later, Mary Burns, Engels' long-time companion, left Manchester, England to join Engels <b>in</b> <b>Brussels.</b>|$|E
5|$|Above all, however, Joseph {{attempted}} {{to break up}} the structure of autonomous states which provided the framework for the Austrian Netherlands. He introduced two reforms in early 1787 instituting new administrative and judicial reform to create a much more centralised system. The first decree abolished many of the administrative structures which had existed since the rule of Emperor Charles V (1500–58) were replaced by a single General Council of Government under a minister-plenipotentiary. In addition, nine administrative circles (cercles), each controlled by an Intendant, were created to which much {{of the power of the}} states was devolved. A second decree abolished the ad hoc semi-feudal or ecclesiastical courts operated by the states and replaced them with a centralised system similar to that already in place in Austria. A single Sovereign Council of Justice was established <b>in</b> <b>Brussels,</b> with two appeal courts <b>in</b> <b>Brussels</b> and Luxembourg, and around 40 local district courts.|$|E
5|$|As {{departments}} {{have changed over}} the years, some are no longer present {{as they have been}} abolished or merged, with most departments present being mainly based <b>in</b> <b>Brussels</b> while retaining a minor presence in Luxembourg. There are however some departments which are still entirely based in the city per the 1965 agreement.|$|E

5|$|By a {{decision}} of the European Council at Edinburgh in December 1992, the Council has its seat <b>in</b> <b>Brussels</b> but in April, June, and October, it holds its meetings in Luxembourg. Between 1952 and 1967 the ECSC Council held its Luxembourg meetings in the Cercle Municipal on Place d’Armes. Its secretariat moved on numerous occasions but between 1955 and 1967 it was housed in the Verlorenkost district of the city. In 1957 {{with the creation of}} two new Communities with their own Councils, discretion on location was given to the current President. In practice this was to be in the Château of Val-Duchesse until the autumn of 1958, at which point it moved to 2 Rue Ravensteinstraat <b>in</b> <b>Brussels.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite the 1965 agreement, the Parliament's seat {{remained}} {{a source of}} contention. Wishing {{to be closer to}} the activities <b>in</b> <b>Brussels</b> and Luxembourg, a few plenary sessions were held by the Parliament between 1967 and 1981 in Luxembourg instead of Strasbourg—against the wishes of France—and in 1981 it returned to holding sessions entirely in Strasbourg. In the previous year it unsuccessfully issued an ultimatum to the national governments, attempting to force them to reach an agreement. Thus, the Parliament moved some of its decision-making bodies to Brussels, along with its committee and political group meetings, and in 1985 it also built a plenary chamber <b>in</b> <b>Brussels</b> for some part-sessions. All the Parliament's attempts in this field were challenged by member states.|$|E
