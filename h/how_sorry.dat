5|$|Lewis {{enters a}} country pub and {{unexpectedly}} meets Audrey {{and her daughter}} Gail. Upon seeing them, he pretends he is his own identical twin brother. Neither Audrey or Gail are fooled and Lewis offers {{to pay for their}} drinks. He then leaves the pub and heads to Coronation Street. Lewis visits Peter Barlow, apologises for stealing from him and returns the money he took with an extra £1000 as compensation. Lewis then goes to Audrey's salon and he tells her he did not mean to hurt her. He asks Audrey to drive him to the police station to prove <b>how</b> <b>sorry</b> he is. After he is given bail, Lewis enters the Rovers Return and is punched by Deirdre. Lewis faces hostility from Audrey's grandson, David (Jack P. Shepherd) upon his return to the salon.

5|$|The episode {{returns to}} the present day. Margaret prepares some orange juice and {{paracetamol}} for Glynis's migraine. She finds a scrap book of press cuttings surrounding Victor's death in Glynis's kitchen drawer and realises that her new friend is responsible for his demise. As ominous music plays, Margaret thoughtfully looks at the box of paracetamol. She drops some tablets into the glass {{and hands it to}} Glynis, who realises that her secret has been uncovered. Glynis explains that the night she was driving she had been told that her husband was close to death and wasn't concentrating on the road properly. As a result, she didn't realise she was about to hit Victor {{until it was too late}} and had stopped, but left when she saw Margaret arrive. She also tells Margaret <b>how</b> <b>sorry</b> she is and how she never meant to hurt anyone, seeking Margaret out in order to try and help her get over Victor's death. Margaret watches her drink some of the orange juice before leaving the house and driving away, with it never being revealed if she'd followed through with her promise to kill the person responsible for Victor's demise.|$|E

500|$|Gunn {{appointed}} a backroom staff of former Norwich colleagues, making Ian Crook first-team coach and John Deehan chief scout. However, the initial turnaround in form {{could not be}} maintained; having lost their last three games of the season, Norwich were relegated from the Championship. Gunn labelled his players as an [...] "embarrassment" [...] after the 4–2 defeat to Charlton Athletic that sealed relegation to League One. Despite relegation to the third tier of English football {{for the first time}} in nearly 50 years, Writing in Tales from the City, Gunn said of the match [...] "Even going to Charlton on the last day, I thought we could survive… We lost 4-2 and were relegated to the third tier. I was shell-shocked; the emptiest I have ever felt in a sporting or professional context. The directors went on the field to face the fans and to thank them for their support and I had tears in my eyes when I saw Delia and Michael doing that. I told them <b>how</b> <b>sorry</b> I was." ...|$|E
2500|$|Irish Taoiseach Brian Cowen {{called on}} FIFA for a replay, stating that [...] "fair play is a {{fundamental}} part of the game". Cowen raised the issue with French President Nicolas Sarkozy while both were at the European Union summit in Brussels on 19 November 2009. After the summit, Sarkozy stated, [...] "I told Brian Cowen <b>how</b> <b>sorry</b> I was for them...But don't ask me to substitute myself for the referee, or the French football authorities, or the European football authorities." ...|$|E
2500|$|At a press conference, Deputy Chief Constable Doug LePard of the VPD {{apologized to}} the victims' families, saying [...] "I wish {{from the bottom of}} my heart that we would have caught him sooner. I wish that, the several {{agencies}} involved, that we could have done better in so many ways. I wish that all the mistakes that were made, we could undo. And I wish that more lives would have been saved. So on my behalf and behalf of the Vancouver Police Department and all the men and women that worked on this investigation, I would say to the families <b>how</b> <b>sorry</b> we all are for your losses and because we did not catch this monster sooner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{never tell}} him to my dying day, wild horses shan't drag it out of me, so you'll forgive me, Meg, and I'll do {{anything}} to show <b>how</b> out-and-out <b>sorry</b> I am," [...] he added, looking very much ashamed of himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "None, miss. They say as <b>how</b> they're <b>sorry,</b> {{but that}} they've nothing to say. I asked Jane, the upper housemaid, miss, {{who is not}} with the rest but stops on; and she tells me {{confidential}} that they've got some notion in their silly heads that the house is haunted!" ...|$|R

2500|$|A {{group of}} {{fishermen}} gather {{the next day}} around the boat where the fish's skeleton is still attached. One of the fishermen measures it to be [...] from nose to tail. Pedrico is given {{the head of the}} fish, and the other fishermen tell Manolin to tell the old man <b>how</b> <b>sorry</b> they are. Tourists at the nearby café mistakenly take it for a shark. The boy, worried about the old man, cries upon finding him safe asleep and at his injured hands. Manolin brings him newspapers and coffee. When the old man wakes, they promise to fish together once again. Upon his return to sleep, Santiago dreams of his youth—of lions on an African beach.|$|E
2500|$|Chicago Mayor Edward Kelly also {{received}} a note:This is to tell you <b>how</b> <b>sorry</b> I am not to not get ole [...] Degnan instead of his girl. Roosevelt and the OPA made their own laws. Why shouldn't I and a lot more? At the time, there was a nationwide meatpackers strike and the Office of Price Administration OPA was talking of extending rationing to dairy products. Degnan was a senior OPA executive recently transferred to Chicago. Another executive of the OPA had recently been assigned armed guards after receiving threats against his children and, in Chicago, a man involved with black market meat had recently been murdered by decapitation. Police considered the possibility the Degnan killer was a meat packer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{whistleblower}} at {{the centre}} of the allegations was later revealed to be Phaedra Almajid, who claimed that she had fabricated the claims of corruption in order to exact revenge on the Qatari bid after being relieved of her campaign job on the team. She signed a legal affidavit and claimed that she decided to go public with her admission because her [...] "lies had gone too far." [...] FIFA confirmed receipt of an email from Almajid stating her retraction. Having originally claimed African Football Confederation president Issa Hayatou, Ivorian FIFA member Jacques Anomua and Nigeria's suspended exco official Amos Adamu were paid $1.5m to vote for Qatar, Almajid went on to say [...] "I cannot tell you <b>how</b> <b>sorry</b> I am. I have hurt reputations of three members of the Fifa [...] exco, I have hurt their reputation, and more importantly I have hurt my colleagues on the Qatar bid." [...] She also stressed that she had not been put under any pressure by the Qatari bid team or anyone else to make a retraction. John Whittingdale, the chairman of the House of Commons select committee for culture, media and sport, stood by the decision to publish the allegations against Qatar and the three executive committee members despite the retraction.|$|E

5000|$|The Los Angeles Times' Kevin Thomas {{calls the}} film a [...] "brisk, incisive and mind-boggling — no other phrase will work — exposé {{of his native}} New Jersey's public {{education}} system," [...] saying that [...] "Bowdon moves beyond statistics to discover <b>how</b> the <b>sorry</b> condition of his state's public schools came to be." ...|$|R

2500|$|Barry {{remained}} on-screen as {{a full-time}} character until 1988. His character was used to highlight many other gay issues, such as homophobia, gay legal inequality — the legal age of gay sexual consent (which {{at the time was}} 21 instead of 16 as it is today) — and most notably the hardship that many young gay men face when [...] "coming out" [...] to their parents. The plot saw Barry forced into [...] "outing" [...] himself to his father, who reacted badly, and this subsequently led to Barry living the remainder of his stay in Walford as a heterosexual in order to appease him [...] — thus highlighting the pressure to conform that many young gay people face. Although the scenes where Barry was disowned by his father (as a result of his sexuality) were filmed, they never made it to air. In an interview featured in EastEnders Handbook by Hilary Kingsly, Michael Cashman expressed <b>how</b> <b>sorry</b> he was that these particular scenes were cut, although no reason for their exclusion was given. As such, Barry's confrontation with his father occurred off-screen. Eventually, the differences between Colin and Barry became too great for them to overcome, they split and Barry left Walford for a job on a cruise ship, but returned briefly in February 1989 to aid the departure of Colin.|$|E

I hope anyone who listens to these words knows <b>how</b> truly <b>sorry</b> I am." ...|$|R

50|$|Then, as Kestrel {{was trying}} to {{organize}} that year's Renaissance Faire, history repeated itself. Mary's parents found out about her engagement to Felix, and refused to let her see Felix again. Felix cracked, and {{wanted to talk to}} Kestrel, who grudgingly agreed. He asked her if this was karma, punishing him for how he treated Kestrel in the past. Seeing <b>how</b> deeply <b>sorry</b> he was and how much he still loved Mary, Kestrel began to forgive Felix.|$|R

6000|$|Lane was {{so shocked}} {{he could not}} collect his {{scattered}} wits, let alone think of {{the right thing to}} say, if there were any right thing.
