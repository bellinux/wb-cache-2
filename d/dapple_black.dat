500|$|The silver dapple gene {{survived for}} two reasons. First, it only affects black colour and {{therefore}} is [...] "masked" [...] in chestnuts. Second, {{when it does}} act on black and bay base coat colors, it produces a chestnut-like phenotype. Silver dapple bays were long registered as [...] "cinnamon chestnuts", and silver <b>dapple</b> <b>blacks</b> as [...] "flaxen-maned dark chestnuts".|$|R
5000|$|Of coat colours, {{the breed}} {{standard}} allows the following: chestnut, bay, black, palomino, buckskin, silver dappled bay, silver <b>dappled</b> <b>black,</b> silver <b>dappled</b> buckskin, and gray. Retaining diversity of coat colour is desirable. BEC/Blue-eyed cream individuals {{may not be}} accepted in the studbook. Star and blaze are common markings, but blazes extending to the eye area, bald faces, and stockings reaching or exceeding 1/3 of the cannon on hind legs are discouraged. Blue eyes, white markings on the body, and [...] "white reaching {{the skin of the}} forelegs" [...] are disqualifying faults.|$|R

40|$|Hyphessobrycon nicolasi is {{described}} from the Uruguay River basin in the Mesopotamian Region, Entre RÃ­os, Argentina. The new species {{can be distinguished}} from all congeners {{by the presence of}} a well-defined oblique and marginal black stripe on each lobe of the caudal fin. Other characters defining H. nicolasi are the possession of 1 - 3 teeth with 3 - 10 cusps on maxilla; outer premaxillary row with 2 - 3 small teeth, with 5 or 7 cusps; iv-vi, 27 - 36 anal-fin rays; 33 - 36 scales on the longitudinal series; two vertical dark spots on the humeral region; dorsal and anal fins <b>dappled</b> in <b>black</b> and base of caudal fin bearing conspicuous black spot; and the presence of bony hooks on the rays of dorsal, anal and caudal fins of the mature males...|$|R
50|$|These colobine Old World monkeys, {{native to}} Southeast Asia, have an {{extremely}} striking appearance. The red-shanked douc characteristically has bright maroon legs and reddish patches around the eyes. In contrast, the grey-shanked douc is less vibrant, with speckled grey legs and orange markings on the face. Both have <b>dappled</b> grey bodies, <b>black</b> {{hands and feet}} and white cheeks, although the cheek hairs of the red-shanked douc are much longer. The black-shanked douc has black legs. Their long hind limbs and tail allow these monkeys to be very agile in their treetop habitat.|$|R
60|$|When the khans and chieftains {{began to}} assemble, there came first {{the sons of}} the king, {{returning}} from the various expeditions on which their father had sent them, and bringing with them magnificent presents. These presents, of course, consisted of the treasures and other valuables which they had taken in plunder from the various cities which had fallen into their hands. The presents which Jughi brought exceeded in value those of all the others. Among the rest, there was a herd of horses one hundred thousand in number. These horses had, of course, been seized in the pastures of the conquered countries, and were now brought to the emperor to be used by him in mounting his troops. They were arrayed in bands according to the color, white, <b>dappled</b> gray, bay, <b>black,</b> and spotted, of each kind an equal number.|$|R
50|$|The Fila Brasileiro has Bloodhound ancestry that {{is evident}} in its long muzzle and {{pendulous}} skin. It is a Molosser breed with large bones and loose skin. The breed standard requires males to be between 65 and 75 cm (25.5 inches to 29.5 inches) high at the withers and weigh 50 to 82 kg. Females are slightly smaller {{and are expected to}} be 60 to 70 cm (23.5 inches to 27.5 inches) high at the withers and weigh at least 41 kg (90 lbs). They have a rectangular build and though they are massive, their natural agility is apparent. The head is big and heavy with a deep muzzle. The ears are large, thick, tapered and either droop or fold back exposing the interior, depending on mood. Neck and back are well muscled, the chest is broad and deep. Unlike the vast majority of canines, the croup is higher than the withers. Legs are heavily boned. The skin is very distinctive of the breed as it is thick and loose all over the body, mainly in the region around the neck. The thick skin forms pronounced dewlaps. In many individuals, the dewlaps proceed to the chest and abdomen. Some dogs show a fold {{at the side of the}} head and also at the withers descending to the shoulders. The coat is short and dense and the texture is normally smooth and soft. Their colours vary from solid, brindle, mouse grey, patched, <b>dappled</b> or <b>black</b> and tan. They are almost never white. Typical colours are fawn, black and brindle. Brindles of a basic color may have the stripes of either less or with very strong intensity. Sometimes a black mask is present.|$|R
60|$|Section 16. The uro-genital {{organs of}} the frog, and {{especially}} those of the male, correspond with embryonic stages of the rabbit. In this sex the testes (T., Sheet 13) lie in the body cavity, and are white bodies usually <b>dappled</b> with <b>black</b> pigment. Vasa efferentia (v.e.) run to the internal border of the anterior part of the kidney, which answers, therefore, to the rabbit's epididymis. The hinder part of the kidney is the predominant renal organ. There is a common uro-genital duct, into which a seminal vesicle, which is especially large in early spring, opens. This is the permanent condition of the frog. In the rabbit, for urogenital duct, we have ureter and vas deferens; the testes and that anterior part of the primitive kidney, the epididymis, shift back into the scrotal sacs, and the ureters shift round the rectum and establish a direct connection with the bladder, carrying the genital ducts looped over them. The oviducts of the female do not fuse distally to form a median vagina {{as they do in}} the rabbit. In front of the genital organ in both sexes is a corpus adiposum (c.ad.), which acts as a fat store, and is peculiar to the frogs and toads. The distal end of the oviduct of the female is in the breeding season (early March) enormously distended with ova, and the ovaries become then the mere vestiges of their former selves. The distal end of the oviduct is, therefore, not unfrequently styled the uterus. There is no penis in the male, fertilisation of the ova occurring as they are squeezed out of the female by the embracing fore limbs of the male. The male has a pad, black in winter, shown in Figure 1, which is closely pressed against the ventral surface of the female in copulation, and which serves as a ready means of distinguishing the sex.|$|R
