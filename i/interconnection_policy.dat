It then looks at the relationship between various aspects of regulatory and institutional policy changes in Europe and how they affect access prices. The paper finds that a lower access price promotes greater deployment of digital technology among US incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs). Based on this finding, it suggests that it is in the ILECs interest to have access to their networks encouraged. The European data for interconnection are recent and far reaching conclusions are not feasible, but the findings, however, suggest that competition has worked by facilitating new entry through decreasing interconnection prices, although path dependencies, of existing and traditional concepts, in the mindsets of operators as well as regulators, may account for these findings.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ensemble}} of European traffic roads is changing {{in relation to}} the economic geography that has been developing these recent years and also to the localisation of production centres, logistics and the demand linked to the transportation of goods. The development of communication has been defined through the project of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T). This network has been progressively defined until it has reached the present architecture in which Italy is crossed by four of the nine total corridors that compose the whole network - which means by almost half of the main traffic roads at European level -. Undoubtedly this new geography of European communication offers member States new development opportunities, but {{it is also true that}} the distance of the different territories from the major traffic roads can be a disparity factor. In fact, this phenomenon can worsen the marginalisation processes of some European territories, contrary to the objective of the <b>interconnection</b> <b>policy</b> of the EU territories. In front of these possible territorial disparities, the Planning discipline in Italy has not been adequately questioned, aiming instead at the research of the “territorial patching up”, progressively decreasing, rather than at the exploration of new development forms. As a consequence, mobility planning becomes strategic for Italy, especially for its Alpine area. Hence the need to set up valid tools for the environmental evaluation as regards planning and programmes, such as the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), but also projects, as the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). The idea to realise an important road infrastructure, which may connect Belluno directly with Austria, is presented in this paper as an emblematic case, in which the application of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) permits to verify the best performing infrastructure on a territorial scale...|$|E
40|$|Scholars have {{neglected}} {{the privatization}} of the Internet, despite the obvious significance of the U. S. Government turning control over a powerful new communication medium to the private sector. This article provides a detailed historical study on {{the transition from a}} government sponsored backbone network to multiple commercially owned backbone networks. Next we document a number of problems that occurred during these privatizations. Not only have these problems led to a lack of competition in the backbone industry, but also the same types of problems are reoccurring in the ongoing privatization of Domain Name System (DNS). The three types of problems that occurred in both privatizations, and will likely occur again in future Internet privatizations, unless recognized, can be categorized as follows: problems with procedural fairness in the processes adopted by the government; the government's management of competition during the privatizations; and problems related to the management of the technological infrastructure. In response, we have developed a series of proposals to address existing problems and to prevent these problems from reoccurring in future privatizations. The specific proposals for the backbone industry are twofold. First, there must be an <b>interconnection</b> <b>policy</b> that ensures all networks non-discriminatory access to the Internet. Second, the government should support the development and use of standardized technologies, which contribute to interconnection, through a new Code-based technological <b>interconnection</b> <b>policy.</b> Such a policy is informed by a guiding principle that new technologies should not amplify network effects and should instead facilitate competition. Thus, we wish to place a discussion of network effects squarely within the discourse on Internet privatization. To increase competition for the ongoing privatization of the DNS, we have three main proposals. First and most importantly, the U. S. Government must ensure that ICANN is accountable to the Internet community as a whole and not just business interests. Second, the U. S. Government must ensure that there is more transparency and public input into ICANN's decision-making. Finally, it must be remembered that a privatization is a means to achieve desirable public purposes, such as the creation of competition, and not an end all by itself since privatization does not, in and of itself, guarantee competition in the relevant market. Without multiple competing firms, the proper use of interconnection agreements to counter network effects in the DNS, and fair treatment by ICANN, there will continue to be problems with {{the privatization of}} the DNS. In analyzing the privatizations of the Internet, our analysis is steeped in the theoretical construct of "Code. " Throughout this work, we explained how Code could regulate behavior, for example, by affecting competition between backbone providers. However, Code all by itself cannot create competition; instead there must be put into place the requirement of policies that all parties shared common ground rules for all competitors. Thus our analysis shows that both Code and policies are necessary to bring competition to the Internet. Additionally, the privatizations have also highlighted two important roles for the government with respect to Code. First, government must be vigilant in ensuring Code is not implemented which is contrary to our societal interests, such as the maintenance of competition in the marketplace. Second, the government should consider encouraging or mandating the development of Code for vindicating certain societal interests, especially in those areas that the private sector has little interest in. The results of this study provide insights and evidence about the appropriate role of government in regulating the Internet. While most rulemaking on the Internet is conducted in a decentralized "bottom-up" manner, this approach has its limitations. Some of these limitations include the private sector acting as top-down rule makers; the limited mobility of most individuals to switch between different rule sets; the role of network effects; and how "bottom-up" rulemaking could be contrary to our society's values. Similarly, the history of the privatizations demonstrates the problems the government had with their use of "top-down" rulemaking. The overarching lesson is that both "top-down" and "bottom-up" modes of regulations have their limitations and problems.

40|$|Belize is {{currently}} faced with several critical challenges {{associated with the}} production, distribution and use of energy. Despite an abundance of renewable energy resources, the country remains disproportionately dependent on imported fossil fuels, which exposes it to volatile and rising oil prices, limits economic development, and retards its ability to make the investments that are necessary for adapting to climate change, which pose a particularly acute threat to the small island states and low-lying coastal nations of the Caribbean. This transition from energy consumption and supply patterns {{that are based on}} imported fossil fuels and electricity towards a more sustainable energy economy that is based on environmentally benign, indigenous renewable energy technologies and more efficient use of energy requires concerted action as the country is already challenged by limited fiscal space which reduces its ability to provide some fiscal incentives, which have been proven to be effective tools for the promotion of sustainable energy markets in a number of countries. This report identifies the fiscal and regulatory barriers to implementation of energy efficiency measures and renewable energy technologies in Belize. Data and information were derived from stakeholder consultations conducted within the country. The major result of the assessment is that the transition of policies and plans into tangible action needs to be increased. In this regard, it is necessary to articulate sub-policies of the National Energy Policy to amend the Public Utilities Commission Act, to develop a grid <b>interconnection</b> <b>policy,</b> to establish minimum energy performance standards for buildings and equipment and to develop a public procurement policy. Finally, decisions on renewable energy and energy efficiency-related incentives from the Government formally requires decision-makers to solve what may be extremely complex optimization problems in order to obtain the lowest-cost provision of energy services to society, thereby weighing the cost of revenue losses with the benefits of fuel and infrastructure expansion savings.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a simple game theoretic model of two Internet access providers who choose between peering and transit agreements. There is no regulation {{with regard to}} <b>interconnection</b> <b>policies</b> of providers, {{though there is a}} general convention that the providers peer if they perceive equal benefits from peering, and have transit arrangements otherwise. In the literature there is a debate whether the large providers gain and exploit market power through the terms of interconnection that they offer to smaller providers. In this paper we develop a game theoretic model to examine how providers decide who they want to peer with and who has to pay transit. The model discusses a set of conditions, which determine the formation of peering and transit agreements. The model takes into account the costs of carrying traffic by peering partners. Those costs should be roughly equal for the providers to have incentives to peer, otherwise the larger provider believes that the smaller provider might free ride on its infrastructure investments. The analysis suggests that the providers do not necessarily exploit market power when refusing to peer. Moreover, Pareto optimum is achieved under transit arrangements only. The paper argues that the market forces determine the decisions of peering and transit, and {{there is no need for}} regulation to encourage peering. Furthermore, to increase efficiency, the regulators might actually need to promote transit arrangements...|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} has {{provided}} an in-depth comparative review of policy approaches to network interconnection in China and Hong Kong SAR, both vertically and horizontally. These {{have been in}} sharp contrast, {{due to differences in}} the regulatory frameworks. Vertically, the <b>interconnection</b> <b>policy</b> in China has experienced a revolutionary leap forward before and after the establishment of the quasi-independent regulator - the Ministry of Information Industry (MII). The affiliation of China Telecom with the former Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) had led to above-cost interconnection fees, protracted negotiations and unfair technical arrangements. As a result, political intervention over interconnection has been frequently requested. The different market position of China Unicom before and after the establishment of the MII has shown that an ineffective regulatory framework is perhaps the largest competitive barrier for new entrants. Horizontally, the controversial status of the former MPT in China and the completely independent status of OFTA in Hong Kong SAR have led to differing levels of regulatory perseverance in liberalising the telecommunications sector, and, in consequence, different approaches in dealing with network interconnections. The less-problematic experience in Hong Kong SAR demonstrates how important an independent regulatory agency is for a secure and healthy competitive market. OFTA's cost-oriented and market-driven principles on network interconnection pricing have, to a certain extent, prevented the occurrence of market distortion, while its transparent guidelines on interconnection have guaranteed the fairness and effectiveness in implementing network interconnection. If OFTA had in close affiliation to any of the operators, it would likely not have been possible for it to have taken this regulatory approach in the past few years. Clearly, an effective regulatory framework {{is one of the most}} critical factors in facilitating network interconnection, and in creating a truly competitive market. One of the lessons to be learned from this case study is that the affiliation of the incumbent operator with the regulator can place new entrants on a path to financial loss and frustration. Therefore, it seems timely for international organisations such as the ITU and the WTO to strengthen their stance in encouraging member states to ensure the independent status of their national regulators. Moreover, in countries where an independent regulator is still to be established, certain international standards over technical aspects of network interconnection, such as points of interconnection, traffic routing, signalling and quality of interconnection, might prove to be helpful...|$|E
40|$|Since 1997, the U. S. {{government}} {{has attempted to}} use the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement on telecommunications services {{as a vehicle for}} 'exporting' American principles of telecommunications regulation to other nations. The United States took the position in 1997 that the WTO telecommunications agreement requires its signatory nations to follow the practices of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on telecommunications regulatory policy. Subsequently, the Office of the U. S. Trade Representative (USTR) has sought to influence, under the implicit threat of trade sanctions, Japan's domestic regulatory policy on the pricing of mandatory competitor access to the unbundled elements of the local network belonging to the operating companies of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT). In this Article, we examine the substantive difficulties of engrafting the FCC's <b>interconnection</b> <b>policy</b> onto the telecommunications marketplace of another nation. For more than five years, many American experts on telecommunications policy have disagreed whether American consumers have benefited from the very FCC policies that the USTR would have Japanese regulators emulate. The USTR's initiative appears to ignore that the transition to costoriented rates for interconnection and retail telecommunications services has been a difficult and unfinished process in the United States; that the cost models used by the FCC to set interconnection prices have significant deficiencies; that actual interconnection prices both within and outside the United States diverge considerably from the estimates of the FCC's cost models; that variations across countries in the prices of inputs {{have a significant effect on}} the costs of interconnection; and that, with respect to depreciation in particular, regulators treat this cost differently'and, from an economic perspective, more reasonably'in Japan than in the United States. Such substantive economic considerations suggest why the FCC's policy in this area has generated continuous litigation, including two Supreme Court cases, since 1996 and consequently is too unresolved at this point in the American experience for the United States to force on its trading partners. Next, we ask whether the USTR has the detailed knowledge required to negotiate trade agreements on interconnection pricing. We question the propriety of using the USTR to influence the domestic regulatory policy of another country on a topic as complex as the efficient pricing of mandatory access to unbundled network elements. The USTR's power to formulate trade policy on this subject resides in officials who are unlikely to possess the economic expertise and resources necessary to evaluate the consumer-welfare implications of the policies that they would have Japan and other nations adopt. For these reasons, the USTR cannot credibly make the interconnection pricing policies of another nation a legitimate concern of U. S. trade policy. ...|$|E

Information dissemination and education was accomplished by publishing newsletters; creating a base of information, guides, and models on the www. irecusa. org and the www. millionsolarroofs. org web sites; convening workshops and seminars; engaging multiple stakeholders; and widening the solar network to include new consumers and decision makers. Two major web sites were maintained throughout the project cycle. The www. irecusa. org web site housed dedicated pages for Connecting to the Grid, Schools Going Solar, Community Outreach, and Certification & Training. The www. millionsolarroofs. org web site was created to serve the MSR Partnerships with news, interviews, key documents, and resource material. Through {{the course of this}} grant, the Interstate Renewable Energy Council has been supporting the Department of Energys solar energy program goals by providing the Department with expertise services for their network of city, state, and community stakeholders. IREC has been the leading force at the state and federal levels regarding net metering and <b>interconnection</b> <b>policy</b> for photovoltaic systems. The principal goal and benefit of the interconnection and net metering work is to lower both barriers and cost for the installation of PV. IREC typically plays a leadership role among small generator stakeholders and has come to be relied upon for its expertise by industry and regulators. IREC also took a leadership position in developing quality and competency standards for solar professionals and for training programs  critical components to bring the solar industry into step with other recognized craft labor forces. IRECs objective was to provide consumer assurances and assist the states and the solar industry in building a strong and qualified workforce. IRECs Schools Going Solar Clearinghouse provided channels of information to educate students, teachers, parents and the community at large about the benefits of solar energy. Solar school projects enhance science and math education while creating an initial entry market for domestic PV. And, IRECs community and outreach network got the right information out to capture the interest and met the needs of different audiences and reached groups that werent traditionally part of the solar community. IRECs PV 4 You project was effective because it resulted in reduced costs through easier interconnection and better net metering agreements and by raising the competency standards for solar practitioners. The project provided ways to eliminate barriers and constraints by providing technical assistance, offering model agreements based on industry consensus that were used by state and local decision makers. And, the project increased public acceptance by providing information, news and guidelines for different audiences...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we begin by {{discussing}} ‘ideology’ as a theoretical construct, and the <b>interconnections</b> between <b>policy</b> and ideology in the education system in England. We analyse the main principles of education policies that can be broadly defined from Left to Right, according to the following ideologies: Marxism/Socialism/Radical Leftism, Social Democracy, Liberal-Progressivism, Neoliberal Conservatism and Neoconservatism. We {{then move on to}} analysing responses to inequalities, as informed by different ideological positions, and identify three main types of responses: (1) conforming; (2) reforming; and (3) transforming. The article concludes by addressing some historical developments in terms of equality in early years and identifies key implications for leadership and management...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the political agendas of public sector and organized private sector interests concerned with policies affecting uncertified home care agencies in three met-ropolitan areas. Using a telephone survey, the study found substantial differences across these groups in both {{the frequency with which}} they work on given issues and in some key attitudes. Overall, respondents were most likely to work on policies related to home care quality, and had particularly diverse—and at times conflicting—concerns in this area. Policymakers need to actively solicit the diverse attitudes of key interest groups towards controversial issues in order to understand less dominant perspectives, keep in mind the <b>interconnection</b> of <b>policy</b> issues, and arrive at politically viable solutions to home care policy problems...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} party {{ideologies}} {{are made up}} of a series of issues that vary in the extent of their interconnections. This approach to party programmes builds on Converse's (1964) description of belief systems and on Downs' (1957) understanding of ideologies. The concept of <b>policy</b> <b>interconnections,</b> originally applied to voter preferences, {{can also be used to}} understand party ideologies. In fact, parties are likely to exhibit stronger interconnections than voters. The strength, nature and effect of <b>policy</b> <b>interconnections</b> are examined for 23 Western European and English-speaking democracies using two expert surveys and the dataset of the Comparative Manifesto Project. Three distinctions need to be made in order to understand how party policies are interconnected. First, linkages between issues are based either on an inherent logic or on historical and sociological circumstance. Logic-based interconnections are more consistent across contexts than circumstance-based interconnections. Moreover, parties are more likely to alter policy stances on two areas simultaneously if the issues are linked through logic. Second, linkages exist for position and salience, but salience interconnections are weaker than their positional counterparts. This helps explain the strategic attraction of salience manipulation. Finally, positions can be more extreme or more moderate than the overall mean party preferences, a characteristic termed the 'degree of unusualness'. Parties are likely to stress such unusual positions, especially if they are small, niche competitors. The findings of this thesis have important implications for the study of party competition. For example, strategies such as vote-maximization and salience manipulation are directly affected by the impact of <b>policy</b> <b>interconnections.</b> This approach therefore significantly extends existing spatial models of party competition and challenges some of their assumptions. As interconnections influence voter choice and coalition formation, there are also broader implications for political representation...|$|R
