25|$|In a 2008 study, complex engine {{controls}} and increased exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> allowed a compression ratio of 19.5 with fuels ranging from neat ethanol to E50.

25|$|Emissions are {{inherent}} to the combustion of diesel fuels that are {{regulated by the}} U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.). As these emissions are a byproduct of the combustion process, {{in order to ensure}} E.P.A. compliance a fuel system must be capable of controlling the combustion of fuels as well as the mitigation of emissions. There are a number of new technologies being phased in to control the production of diesel emissions. The exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> system, E.G.R., and the diesel particulate filter, D.P.F., are both designed to mitigate the production of harmful emissions.|$|E
25|$|While {{studying}} {{the effect of}} biodiesel on a D.P.F. {{it was found that}} though the presence of sodium and potassium carbonates aided in the catalytic conversion of ash, as the diesel particulates are catalyzed, they may congregate inside the D.P.F. and so interfere with the clearances of the filter. This may cause the filter to clog and interfere with the regeneration process. In a study on the impact of E.G.R. rates with blends of jathropa biodiesel it was shown that there was a decrease in fuel efficiency and torque output due to the use of biodiesel on a diesel engine designed with an E.G.R. system. It was found that CO and CO2 emissions increased with an increase in exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> but NOx levels decreased. The opacity level of the jathropa blends was in an acceptable range, where traditional diesel was out of acceptable standards. It was shown that a decrease in Nox emissions could be obtained with an E.G.R. system. This study showed an advantage over traditional diesel within a certain operating range of the E.G.R. system.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe article {{outlines}} {{the results of}} comparative assessment of characteristics of the diesel 4 ChN 13 / 15 working process with exhaust <b>gases</b> <b>recirculation</b> and their cooling in the vortex tube. It is shown {{that the presence of}} cooling on the most exploited mode of work of the engine (n= 1250  min- 1, loading 75 %), with the share of recycled gases in the fresh charge equal to 18 % and their cooling on 60 K, gives an observable temperature difference of the fresh charge on the input to cylinder, the maximum and average gases temperature in the head-end volume. Moreover, a lower fresh charge temperature in case of cooling the recycled gases provides the increase of oxygen mass fraction in the head-end space, and, consequently, it allows boosting the fuel combustion which leads to a more intensive heat generation...|$|R

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) direct {{numerical}} simulation and experimental Schlieren results were used to study a non-equilibrium plasma discharge in a lean CH 4 -air mixture. The impact of <b>gas</b> flow <b>recirculation</b> on the temporal evolution of species and gas temperature {{in the vicinity of}} the discharge zone was examined. The results showed that the formation of a fresh gas counterflow with stagnation plane at the center of the discharge and parallel to the electrodes changed the topology of the hot kernel from an initial cylindrical shape to a toroidal one. This phenomenon leads to an increase of the area/volume ratio of the reactive kernel that may result under certain conditions in kernel extinction. Also the importance of considering this 3 D <b>gas</b> flow <b>recirculation</b> was revealed to correctly predict the temporal evolution of the hot kernel. Particularly the temperature and species concentrations in the central region of the discharge returned to fresh gas conditions shortly after the end of the pulse in the order of 150 μs. This result is particularly important for ignition by Nanosecond Repetitively Pulsed discharges since the gas conditions at the beginning of each successive pulse depend greatly on the time interval between pulses thus on the pulse frequency.

25|$|Although the 200Tdi engine {{had been}} an undoubted {{technological}} and sales success, it had certain limitations and flaws {{that needed to be}} rectified. Despite the numerous differences, it was still in essence a direct-injection version of the older Diesel Turbo engine. It was also considered rather raucous and unrefined, especially for use in the Discovery and Range Rover models. A special version of the engine had to be produced to fit the Defender, and problems with weak head gasket had been identified. The British Army (and some other military buyers) had not opted for the 200Tdi because it could not be fitted with a 24-volt generator for powering radio equipment- instead the Army continued to buy vehicles with 2.5-litre naturally aspirated diesels. Upcoming European diesel emissions regulations (Euro I) meant that Land Rover would be forced to radically alter the engine anyway. The resulting development project (coded Romulus) produced the 300Tdi engine. Although externally very similar to the Discovery/Range Rover version of its predecessor, 208 changes were made. These included modifications to the block, cylinder head, fuel injector system and ancillary systems. The crankshaft, pistons and connecting rods were significantly altered over the 200Tdi. The most obvious external changes were the fitting of a rubber acoustic cover over the engine to reduce noise and the change to a single serpentine belt to drive the ancillaries instead of the multiple V-belts of the older engines. Emissions regulation included the fitting of an exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> system. Power and torque outputs remained the same, and the engine had been specifically designed to be compatible with all the models in the Land Rover range without any changes. This meant that the Defender engines were fitted in the same tune as the Discovery/Range Rover engines. The 300Tdi was noticeably smoother and quieter than the 200Tdi, but was generally found to not be quite as economical in real-world use. It turned out that the Euro I emissions regulations were not as severe as Land Rover anticipated, and so the 300Tdi was able to remain in production until the introduction of the Euro III rules. When fitted to vehicles with an automatic transmission, power was increased to 122 horsepower {{to make up for the}} power losses in the transmission. These engines (designated 23L) had Bosch Electronic Diesel Control systems, where the mechanical injector system was controlled by a drive-by-wire electronic throttle to reduce emissions. The 300Tdi was replaced in 1998 by the 5-cylinder Td5, bringing to an end the line of Land Rover 4-cylinder engines that can be traced back to 1957. The Td5 engine was loosely based on the Rover Group's L-series diesel engine. The 300Tdi remained in production in Brazil, and was offered as an option on rest of world (non-UK/Europe) models. Following Ford's acquisition of Land Rover in 2000, the engine was used in Brazilian-built Ford pick-up trucks as well. Increasing emissions laws worldwide and falling sales led to production of the 300Tdi ending in 2006. A much-modified 2.8-litre version was built by International Engines in Brazil until 2010, and was available as an after-market fitment to Land Rovers through specialist converters. International then became MWM International Motores and a further update of the 300Tdi design was launched as the 3.0 Power Stroke. Although based around the same block and basic architecture as the 300Tdi the Power Stroke has major differences such as electronic common rail injection and new crossflow cylinder head with Overhead camshaft.|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, Yugo America {{introduced}} an {{electronic fuel injection}} version of the Yugo GVX to replace the less expensive carbureted fuel system; however, it arrived too late {{as the result of}} a recall by the United States Environmental Protection Agency of over 126,000 vehicles sold in the United States due to a failure to meet exhaust emissions. The recall effectively caused Yugo America to cease importation and fold in April 1992. The faulted emission system used an [...] "emissions" [...] carburetor of outdated design, a two-way catalyst that required an air pump, and exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> valve; the outdated, power-reducing application of this equipment on an already under-performing drivetrain was one of the major problems that caused the vehicles to get a reputation for poor drivability and the inability to meet emission standards.|$|E
40|$|An {{industrial}} burner {{operating in}} the MILD combustion regime through internal <b>recirculation</b> of exhaust <b>gases</b> has been characterized numerically. To develop a self-sufficient numerical model of the burner, two subroutines are coupled to the CFD solver to model the air preheater section and heat losses from the burner through radiation. The resulting model is validated against experimental data on species concentration and temperature. A 3 -dimensional CFD model of the burner is compared to an axisymmetric model, which allows considerable computational saving, but neglects some important burner features such {{as the presence of}} recirculation windows. Errors associated with the axisymmetric model are evaluated and discussed, as well as possible simplified procedures for engineering purposes. Modifications of the burner geometry are investigated numerically and suggested in order to enhance its performances. Such modifications are aimed at improving exhaust <b>gases</b> <b>recirculation</b> which is driven by the inlet air jet momentum. The burner is found to produce only 30 ppmv of NO when operating in MILD combustion mode. For the same air preheating the NO emissions would be of approximately 1000 ppmv in flame combustion mode. It is also shown that the burner ensures more homogeneous temperature distribution in the outer surfaces with respect to flame operation, and this is attractive for burners used in furnaces devoted to materials' thermal treatment processes. The effect of air excess on the combustion regime is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation performed upon a single-ended self-recuperative radiant tube burner fuelled by natural gas in the non-premixed mode, which is used in the steel industry for surface treatment. The main goal of the research activity was a systematic investigation of the burner aimed to find the best operating conditions in terms of optimum equivalence ratio, thermal power and lower pollutant emissions. The analysis, which focused on the main parameters influencing the thermal efficiency and pollutant emissions at the exhaust (NOx and CO), has been carried out for different operating conditions of the burner: input thermal powers from 12. 8 up to 18 kW and equivalence ratio from 0. 5 (very lean flame) to 0. 95 (quasi-stoichiometric condition). To significantly reduce pollutant emissions ensuring {{at the same time the}} thermal requirements of the heating process, it has been developed a new burner configuration, in which a fraction of the exhaust gases recirculates in the main combustion region through a variable gap between the burner efflux and the inner flame tube. This internal <b>recirculation</b> mechanism (exhaust <b>gases</b> <b>recirculation,</b> EGR) has been favoured through the addition of a pre-combustion chamber terminated by a converging nozzle acting as a mixing/ejector to promote exhaust gas entrainment into the flame tube.

2500|$|As a fuel, {{methanol}} and ethanol {{both have}} {{advantages and disadvantages}} over fuels such as petrol (gasoline) and diesel fuel.

Note that AKI refers to 'Anti-Knock Index' which averages the RON and MON ratings (RON+MON)/2, and is used on U.S. gas station pumps. [...] Ordinary European petrol is typically 95 RON, 85 MON, equal to 90 AKI.

2500|$|The Moke {{was built}} in Australia from 1966 to 1981 where it was {{originally}} marketed as the Morris Mini Moke and from 1973 as the Leyland Moke. Initially Australian Mokes had the same 10-inch wheels as British Mokes and Mini saloons but in 1968 these were replaced by 13-inch wheels with longer rear trailing arms, which made them more practical for gentle off-road or beach use than the British version. There was also a widening piece welded to the wheel arches, front and rear to allow for wider tyres and rims. [...] The solid metal seats of the British Mokes were replaced with tubular-framed [...] "deck-chair" [...] seats. This variant started with a 998cc engine, which was switched mid-production to 1,098cc.

For model year 1993, Lotus design modifications were made to the cylinder heads, exhaust system and valvetrain of the LT5, bringing horsepower up from 375 to 405. In addition, a new exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> system improved emissions control. [...] The model remained nearly unchanged into the 1995 model year, after which the ZR-1 was discontinued as the result of waning interest, development of the LS series engines, cost and the coming of the C5 generation.

Not until the debut of the C5 platform Z06 in 2001 would Chevrolet have another production Corvette capable of matching the ZR-1's performance.|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 5 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 1 - 4 July, 2007. In this work has been developed a methodology to determine nitrogen oxides emissions (NOx) in steam generators that burn both fuel oil and natural gas. The methodology is based on four main parameters related to combustion process in the furnace active burning zone (ABZ). Such parameters are the following ones: air excess coefficient in ABZ, average temperature in ABZ, reflected heat in ABZ and the residence time of combustion products in ABZ. As a tool to apply this methodology, there was a specially designed software which was named “NOX AD”. It can calculate the four parameters above {{as well as the}} NOx concentration for different operational methods to get a maximized reduction of NOx. The methodology was applied in a 350 -ton/h (80 MW) steam generator manufactured by Combustion Engineering, which is equipped with tangential burners and is currently working in the thermoelectric plant Ing. Jorge Luque located in the State of Mexico. The fuel oil used has a mass percentage composition of C= 84. 9 %, S= 3. 8 %, N= 0. 4 %, H= 10. 8 %, O= 0. 0 % and W= 0. 0 %. The natural gas has a volume percentage composition of CH 4 = 91. 97 %, C 2 H 6 = 7. 12 % and C 3 H 8 = 0. 91 %. Different methods of NOx decrease were applied by using “NOX AD” software: <b>gases</b> <b>recirculation,</b> entrance place of <b>recirculation</b> <b>gases,</b> water injection in the ABZ, combustion at two stages and combinations of methods.

40|$|Colorless Distributed Combustion (CDC) with swirl is {{investigated}} for {{gas turbine engine}} applications due to its benefits for ultra-low pollutants emission, improved pattern factor and thermal field uniformity, low noise emission, and stable combustion with the alleviation of combustion instabilities. Adequate and fast mixing between the injected air and internally recirculated hot reactive gases to form hot and diluted oxidant is critical for CDC, followed by rapid mixing with the fuel. This results in distributed reaction zone instead of a concentrated thin flame front as observed in conventional diffusion flames, leading to avoidance of hot spot regions and providing reduced NOx and CO emissions. The focus of this dissertation is to develop and demonstrate CDC in a cylindrical combustor for application to stationary gas turbine combustors. The dissertation examines the sequential development of ultra-low emission colorless distributed combustor operating at a nominal thermal intensity of 36 MW/m 3 -atm. Initially, the role of swirl is evaluated through comparing the performance of swirling and non-swirling configurations with focus on pollutants emission, stability, and isothermal flowfield through particle image velocimetry. Different fuel injection locations have also been examined, and based on performance a swirling configuration have been down selected for further investigations demonstrating emissions as low as 1 PPM of NO with a 40 % reduction compared to non-swirling configuration. Further investigations were performed to outline the impact of inlet air temperature and combustor pressure on reaction distribution and combustor performance. Next, Fuel flexibility has been examined with view to develop CDC combustors that can handle different gaseous and liquid fuels, both traditional and renewable. These fuels included diluted methane, hydrogen enriched methane, propane, ethanol, kerosene, JP- 8, Hydrogenated Renewable Jet fuel, and novel biofuel. Swirling CDC combustor demonstrated emissions below 7. 5 PPM of NO regardless of the fuel used, with emissions below 40 PPM of CO for liquid fuels and 10 PPM for gaseous fuels. Further enhancement of swirling CDC combustor was sought next. Various fuel injection techniques have been examined, outlining the importance of fuel injection location with respect to air and hot reactive <b>gases</b> <b>recirculation.</b> The impact of air injection velocity on combustor performance have been examined in terms of increased recirculation (via isothermal flow field characterization using PIV) and enhanced performance with lower pollutants emission leading to 45 % reduction in NO emissions with no impact on CO emissions. The impact of fuel dilution on mixing and performance has been also examined as a method to enhance mixing due to the increased fuel jet momentum. Dual air and fuel injection have been explored to outline the impact of multi injection on combustor performance for scaling up of the combustor. Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence technique {{was used to evaluate}} the reaction behavior and its distribution in the combustor through detection of activated OH radicals at different activation lines in different configurations. The different investigations performed (experimentally and numerically) have been compiled and analyzed with view to develop a "Distribution Index" that evaluated the reaction distribution in a given combustor based on certain parameters. These parameters include, but no limited to, hot reactive <b>gases</b> <b>recirculation</b> (entrainment) rate, air injection velocity, mixing between air and fuel, and operational equivalence ratio and inlet air temperature.

2500|$|The {{shape of}} the Wankel {{combustion}} chamber is more resistant to preignition operating on lower-octane rating gasoline than a comparable piston engine. The combustion chamber shape may also lead to relatively incomplete combustion of the air-fuel charge. This {{would result in a}} larger amount of unburned hydrocarbons released into the exhaust. The exhaust is, however, relatively low in NOx emissions, because combustion temperatures are lower than in other engines, and also because of some inherent exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> (EGR) in early engines. Sir Harry Ricardo showed in the 1920s that for every 1% increase in the proportion of exhaust gas in the admission mix, there is a 7°C reduction in flame temperature. This allowed Mazda to meet the United States Clean Air Act of 1970 in 1973, with a simple and inexpensive [...] "thermal reactor", which was an enlarged chamber in the exhaust manifold. By decreasing the air-fuel ratio, unburned hydrocarbons (HC) in the exhaust would support combustion in the thermal reactor. Piston-engine cars required expensive catalytic converters to deal with both unburned hydrocarbons and NOx emissions. This inexpensive solution increased fuel consumption, which was already a weak point for the Wankel engine, and the oil crisis of 1973 raised the price of gasoline. Toyota discovered that injection of air into the exhaust port zone improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. The best results were obtained with holes in the side plates; doing it in the exhaust duct had no noticeable influence. The use of a three-stage catalysts, with air supplied in the middle, as for two-stroke piston engines, also proved beneficial.|$|E

Solutions {{to the problem of}} heat management in fixed bed reactors at high temperature and high pressure are described, while a continuous flow of nitrogen for driving a gas turbine is produced. Each reactor involved in the process goes through a cyclic sequence of five reaction and heat transfer stages. Cool product <b>gas</b> <b>recirculations</b> are incorporated into the Ni oxidation and NiO reduction stages in order to moderate the maximum temperatures in the beds and control the displacement of the reaction and heat transfer fronts. A preliminary conceptual design of the process has been carried out to determine the minimum number of reactors needed for continuous operation in typical large-scale CO 2 capture systems. Basic reactor models and assumptions based on an ideal plug flow pattern have been used in all the reactors during the chemical reactions and the heat transfer operations.
