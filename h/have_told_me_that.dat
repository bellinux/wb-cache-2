Journalist Robyn Flans, {{writing for the}} Percussive Arts Society, stated: [...] "I cannot {{count the number of}} drummers who <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Ringo inspired their passion for drums". Drummer Steve Smith commented on Starr's musical contribution: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Badlaa" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{inspired}} by stories of Indian fakirs. In fact, the episode's title means [...] "to retort" [...] or [...] "to revenge" [...] in Urdu. Further inspiration came [...] "from {{a little bit of}} desperation" [...] according to Shiban. He later recalled that he was walking through the Vancouver airport and suddenly had the thought, [...] "What if someone who {{came up to me and}} asked me for money was actually a bad guy." [...] Shiban later noted that his early drafts of the episode featured the antagonist with a different power. He explained, [...] "My original idea was a beggar with no legs who can actually shrink himself and climb inside your ear, and Chris Carter–and this is why he's Chris Carter–said 'No, no, no! I know what's even better.'" [...] Shiban later said that [...] "... one thing about this episode that I'm sort of proud is that people often <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it is the most disgusting thought that they ever had, that this little man would actually enter your body and travel around inside you." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011, Ford {{promised to}} release a [...] "real {{comeback}} album" [...] {{later in the year}} with drummer Chuck Spradlin, saying that 2009's nu metal-inspired Wicked Wonderland, {{was too much of a}} collective project with ex-husband Jim Gillette. [...] "A lot of people <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> they want a real Lita Ford album, and I know what they mean. They are going to get it", she was quoted as saying at the time.|$|E

2500|$|According to Hassan Hassan {{writing in}} the Guardian {{newspaper}} in mid-2012, while the Brotherhood did come to dominate the Syrian National Council, a body formed outside Syria, the Brotherhood {{appears to be more}} popular among exiles than in the uprising population inside Syria. [...] "Activists from various parts of Syria <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> prior to the uprising last year, the country had almost zero Brotherhood presence." [...] "At least 70%" [...] of Syria's population – non-Sunnis (Muslim and Christian), Kurds, and tribal groups [...] "have been outside" [...] the Brotherhood's influence [...] "in the past", and Hassan believes will remain so in the future.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{authors have}} written {{material}} they claimed was channeled from Seth, especially after Roberts' death. These included Thomas Massari, {{who founded the}} Seth-Hermes Foundation {{and said he had}} channeled Seth as early as 1972, and Jean Loomis, director of the Aquarian Center in Connecticut and others to date. [...] However, in the introduction to the first book written about Seth, Seth is said to have conveyed that [...] "communications will come exclusively through Ruburt [...] at all times, to protect the integrity of the material". In The Seth Material, Jane Roberts wrote: [...] "Several people <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Seth communicated with them through automatic writing, but Seth denies any such contacts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like {{the other}} players in the Heartbreakers, Campbell avoids the virtuoso {{approach}} to playing, preferring to have his work {{serve the needs of}} each song. Guitar World magazine noted [...] "there are only a handful of guitarists who can claim to have never wasted a note. Mike Campbell is certainly one of them". He is a highly melodic player, often using two or three-strings-at-a-time leads instead of the more conventional one-at-a-time approach. [...] "People <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> my playing sounds like bagpipes," [...] he muses. [...] "I'm not exactly sure what that means." [...] His estimation of his own style is typically modest: [...] "I don't think people can really top Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton as far as lead guitar goes. I like my playing to bring out the songs." [...] Like Tench, he is heavily involved in constructing the arrangements for the Heartbreakers' tunes. And also like Tench, he prefers rawness to polish in the studio and onstage.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, O'Neal {{said that}} Bryant {{should have won}} the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, which was awarded to Dirk Nowitzki. During the offseason, Bryant was [...] "beyond furious" [...] at reports from a Laker insider that Bryant had insisted O'Neal be traded from the Lakers. [...] Bryant {{reported}} that Buss said, [...] "I {{am not going to}} re-sign Shaq. I am not about to pay him $30 million a year or $80 million over three years ... His body is breaking down, and I don't want to pay that money to him when I can get value for him right now rather than wait ... It doesn't matter to me what you do in free agency because I do not want to pay , period." [...] O'Neal agreed with Bryant: [...] "There's {{no doubt in my mind}} Kobe is telling the truth. I believe him a thousand percent ... I would have respected Dr. Buss more as a man if he would <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> himself, because I know he said it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Hermione Granger {{is played}} by the South African-born actress Noma Dumezweni, also known for her work in Linda, A Raisin in the Sun and A Human Being Died That Night. Dumezweni {{described}} the role as a [...] "privilege and a responsibility" [...] and said that [...] "we all aspire to be Hermione." [...] The choice of a black actress to play the part led to criticism on social media, which J.K. Rowling described as being by [...] "a bunch of racists", adding that the books never explicitly mentioned her race or skin colour, and {{that she has been}} portrayed as black in fan art. Emma Watson also expressed her support for the actress, tweeting that she looked forward to seeing her in the role. Dumezweni herself called the backlash [...] "so unimaginative", stating that [...] "So many young actors and actresses <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> they’re so pleased I’m playing Hermione because they can see a version of themselves on the stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1977 Fleetwood and Nicks began {{having an}} affair. It would {{continue}} sporadically {{for the next}} two years during the fallout from the end of Fleetwood's relationship with Boyd, until the pair mutually decided to end the affair. [...] "Never in a million years could you <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> [...] would happen," [...] Nicks later stated. [...] "Everybody was angry, because Mick was married to a wonderful girl and had two wonderful children. I was horrified. I loved these people. I loved his family. So it couldn't possibly work out. And it didn't. I just couldn't." [...] Boyd and Fleetwood had in fact begun living together once more in 1976, and would remarry temporarily to assist their children with emigration to the United States. However they quickly divorced for the second time some months later. In November 1978 Fleetwood moved into a Bel Air home with Sara Recor, mutual friend of Fleetwood and Nicks who was at the time married to another music producer. Meanwhile, Fleetwood began working on a charity project to get Fleetwood Mac to tour the Soviet Union, however the Soviet War in Afghanistan later made the tour untenable.|$|E

2500|$|Romain Dillet of TechCrunch focused {{mostly on}} the iPad in his review, writing that iOS 11 [...] "turns your iPad into a {{completely}} different machine", with [...] "much more efficient" [...] multitasking and improved ease of access with the application dock. He also praised the design overhaul of the App Store, calling it [...] "a huge improvement compared to the previous App Store", and also highlighted design changes in other apps, including [...] "a huge bold header {{with the name of}} the app or section". Although he acknowledged that [...] "Many tech friends <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> they hate this change", Dillet stated that [...] "I think most people will like it. It’s visually pleasing and distinctive". He stated that augmented reality will become more relevant in the days following the iOS 11 release as third-party developers incorporate features into their apps, and praised Apple for creating the ARKit development tools as it [...] "makes it much easier to implement augmented reality features". In conclusion, Dillet wrote that [...] "Ten years ago, iOS started as a constrained operating system. It {{is now one of the}} biggest digital playgrounds".|$|E
