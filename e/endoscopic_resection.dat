5|$|Colonization with H. pylori is not {{a disease}} in and of itself, but a {{condition}} associated {{with a number of}} disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Testing for H. pylori is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after <b>endoscopic</b> <b>resection</b> of early gastric cancer, first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of dyspepsia, not routinely. Several ways of testing exist. One can test noninvasively for H. pylori infection with a blood antibody test, stool antigen test, or with the carbon urea breath test (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath). Also, a urine ELISA test with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity is available. None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy. Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity. Some drugs can affect H. pylori urease activity and give false negatives with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting H. pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy, combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main cause}} of Barrett's {{esophagus}} {{is thought to be}} an adaptation to chronic acid exposure from reflux esophagitis. [...] The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has increased substantially in the Western world in recent years. The condition is found in 5–15% of patients who seek medical care for heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease), although a large subgroup of patients with Barrett's esophagus do not have symptoms. Diagnosis requires endoscopy (more specifically, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, a procedure in which a fibreoptic cable is inserted through the mouth to examine the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum) and biopsy. The cells of Barrett's esophagus, after biopsy, are classified into four general categories: nondysplastic, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and frank carcinoma. [...] High-grade dysplasia and early stages of adenocarcinoma can be treated by <b>endoscopic</b> <b>resection</b> and new endoscopic therapies such as radiofrequency ablation, whereas advanced stages (submucosal) are generally advised to undergo surgical treatment.

50|$|Endoscopic submucosal {{dissection}} (ESD) is {{an advanced}} surgical procedure using endoscopy to remove gastrointestinal tumors {{that have not}} entered the muscle layer. ESD may {{be done in the}} esophagus, stomach or colon. Application of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>resection</b> (ER) to gastrointestinal (GI) neoplasms is limited to lesions with no risk of nodal metastasis. Either polypectomy or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is beneficial for patients because of its low level of invasiveness. However, to ensure the curative potential of these treatment modalities, accurate histopathologic assessment of the resected specimens is essential because the depth of invasion and lymphovascular infiltration of the tumor is associated with considerable risk for lymph node metastasis. For accurate assessment of the appropriateness of the therapy, en bloc resection is more desirable than piecemeal resection. For a reliable en bloc resection of GI neoplasms, a new method of ER called endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been developed.|$|E

AIM: To evaluate the value of p 53 and Ki- 67 immunohistochemistry in predicting the cancer recurrence in patients with Barrett's esophagus-related cancer referred to circumferential <b>endoscopic</b> mucosal <b>resection.</b> METHODS: Mucosectomy specimens from 41 patients were analyzed. All endoscopic biopsies prior to <b>endoscopic</b> mucosal <b>resection</b> presented high-grade dysplasia and cancer was detected in 23 of them. Positive reactions were considered the intense coloration in the nuclei of at least 90 % of the cells in each high-power magnification field, and immunostaining {{could be classified as}} superficial or diffuse according to the mucosal distribution of the stained nuclei. RESULTS: <b>Endoscopic</b> mucosal <b>resection</b> samples detected cancer in 21 cases. In these cases, p 53 immunohistochemistry revealed a diffuse positivity for the great majority of these cancers (90. 5 % vs. 20 %), and Ki- 67 showed a diffuse pattern for all cases (100 % vs. 30 %); conversely, patients without cancer revealed a superficial or negative pattern for p 53 (80 % vs. 9. 5 %) and Ki- 67 (70 % vs. 0 %). During a mean follow-up of 31. 6 months, 5 (12. 2 %) patients developed six episodes of recurrent cancer. <b>Endoscopic</b> mucosal <b>resection</b> specimens did not show any significant difference in the p 53 and Ki- 67 expression for patients developing cancer after endoscopic treatment.

50|$|ESD is {{characterized}} by three steps: injecting fluid into the submucosa to elevate the lesion from the muscle layer, circumferential cutting of the surrounding mucosa of the lesion, and subsequent dissection of the connective tissue of the submucosa beneath the lesion. Major advantages of this technique in comparison with polypectomy or EMR are as follows. The resected size and shape can be controlled, en bloc resection is possible even in a large neoplasm, and neoplasms with submucosal fibrosis are also resectable. So this technique {{can be applied to}} the resection of complex neoplasms such as large neoplasms, ulcerative non-lifting neoplasms, and recurrent neoplasms. The disadvantages of this technique are the requirement of two or more assistants, it is time-consuming, there is a higher risk of bleeding and perforation than EMR. In Japan, ESD is now gaining acceptance as the standard <b>endoscopic</b> <b>resection</b> technique for stomach neoplasms in an early stage, especially for large or ulcerative neoplasms.

Question In {{patients who had}} <b>endoscopic</b> <b>resection</b> for early gastric cancer, does eradication of Helicobacter pylori reduce risk for metachronous gastric cancer...|$|E
25|$|Forms of {{endoscopic}} therapy {{have been}} used for stage 0 and I disease: <b>endoscopic</b> mucosal <b>resection</b> (EMR) and mucosal ablation using radiofrequency ablation, photodynamic therapy, Nd-YAG laser, or argon plasma coagulation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Endoscopic</b> mucosal <b>resection</b> {{has also}} been {{evaluated}} as a management technique. Additionally an operation known as a Nissen fundoplication can reduce the reflux of acid from the stomach into the esophagus.|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{therapeutic}} endoscopy, {{in particular}} <b>endoscopic</b> mucosal <b>resection,</b> <b>endoscopic</b> submucosal dissection, per-oral endoscopic myotomy, submucosal <b>endoscopic</b> tumor <b>resection</b> {{opened a new}} era where direct esophageal visualization is possible. Combining these information with advanced diagnostic endoscopy, the esophagus is organized, from the luminal side to outside, into five layers (epithelium, lamina propria with lamina muscularis mucosa, submucosa, muscle layer, adventitia). A specific vascular system belonging to each layer is thus visible: Mucosa with the intra papillary capillary loop in the epithelium and the sub-epithelial capillary network in the lamina propria and, at the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) level with the palisade vessels; submucosa with the drainage vessels and the spindle veins at LES level; muscle layer with the perforating vessels; peri-esophageal veins in adventitia. These structures are particularly important to define endoscopic landmark for the gastro-esophageal junction, helpful in performing submucosal therapeutic endoscopy...|$|R
