5|$|Tolkien began devising the {{language}} around 1910 and restructured the grammar several times until Quenya reached its final state. The vocabulary remained relatively stable throughout the creation process. Also, {{the name of}} {{the language}} was repeatedly changed by Tolkien from <b>Elfin</b> and Qenya to the eventual Quenya. The Finnish language had been a major source of inspiration, but Tolkien was also familiar with Latin, Greek, and ancient Germanic languages when he began constructing Quenya.|$|E
5|$|The Albany Pine Bush {{is home to}} {{hundreds}} of species of Lepidoptera (moths), including over 40 Noctuidae considered to be pine barrens specialists. The most well-known species in the area is the Karner blue (Lycaeides melissa samuelis), discovered in the 1940s and named by the author Vladimir Nabokov. The butterfly {{is now on the}} Endangered Species List. Once found in large numbers throughout the grassy openings of the pine barrens, it is today extremely rare and found in a handful of sites. Attempts to reintroduce the butterfly focus on the food and host plant for its larvae – the wild blue lupine, which needs frequent forest fires to maintain its habitat. Other regionally rare butterflies include the dusted skipper (Atrytonopsis hianna), Henry's <b>elfin</b> (Incisalia henrici), frosted <b>elfin</b> (Incisalia irus), and Edward's hairstreak (Satyrium edwardsii). The inland barrens buck moth (Hemileuca maia) is a state-listed special concern animal; and other rare moths include the broad-lined catopyrrha (Catopyrrha coloraria), several noctuid moths (Apharetra purpurea, Chaetaglaea cerata, Chytonix sensilis, Macrochilo bivittata, and Zanclognatha martha), bird dropping moth (Cerma cora), and a geometrid moth (Itame). The Albarufan dagger moth was last seen in the Pine Bush in 1983 and is presumed locally extinct.|$|E
5|$|The genus Gyromitra {{had been}} classically {{considered}} part of the family Helvellaceae, along with the similar-looking <b>elfin</b> saddles of the genus Helvella. Analysis of the ribosomal DNA of many of the Pezizales showed Gyromitra esculenta and the other false morels to be only distantly related to {{the other members of the}} Helvellaceae and instead most closely related to the genus Discina, forming a clade which also contains Pseudorhizina and Hydnotrya. Thus the four genera are now included in the family Discinaceae.|$|E

5|$|However, in Scotland {{and parts}} of {{northern}} England near the Scottish border, beliefs in elves remained prominent into the nineteenth century. James VI of Scotland and Robert Kirk discussed elves seriously; elf-beliefs are prominently attested in the Scottish witchcraft trials, particularly the trial of Issobel Gowdie; and related stories also appear in folktales, There is a significant corpus of ballads narrating stories about elves, such as Thomas the Rhymer, where a man meets a female elf; Tam Lin, The <b>Elfin</b> Knight, and Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight, in which an Elf-Knight rapes, seduces, or abducts a woman; and The Queen of Elfland's Nourice, a woman is abducted to be a wet-nurse to the elf-queen's baby, but promised that she may return home once the child is weaned.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 1924 Blyton married Major Hugh Alexander Pollock, DSO (1888–1971) at Bromley Register Office, without {{inviting}} her family. They married {{shortly after}} he divorced from his first wife, {{with whom he had}} two sons. Pollock was editor of the book department in the publishing firm of George Newnes, which became her regular publisher. It was he who requested that Blyton write a book about animals, The Zoo Book, which was completed in the month before they married. They initially lived in a flat in Chelsea before moving to <b>Elfin</b> Cottage in Beckenham in 1926, and then to Old Thatch in Bourne End (called Peterswood in her books) in 1929. Blyton's first daughter Gillian, was born on 15 July 1931, and after a miscarriage in 1934, she gave birth to a second daughter, Imogen, on 27 October 1935.|$|E
5|$|In his lifetime, J. R. R. Tolkien {{never ceased}} to {{experiment}} on his constructed languages, {{and they were}} subjected to many revisions. Therefore, Quenya had many grammars with substantial differences between the different stages of its development. During the first conceptual stage of early Quenya c. 1910 to c. 1920, the language was called <b>Elfin</b> in English and Eldarissa in Qenya proper. While its development was a continuous process, Quenya underwent {{a number of major}} revisions in its grammar, mostly in conjugation and the pronominal system. The vocabulary, however, was not subject to sudden or extreme change. Tolkien sometimes changed the meaning of a word, but he almost never discarded it once invented, and he kept on refining its meaning, and countlessly forged new synonyms. Moreover, Elvish etymology was in constant flux. Tolkien delighted in inventing new etymons for his Quenya vocabulary. But after the publication of The Lord of the Rings (finished c. 1949–1950, published in 1954–1955), the grammar rules of Quenya went through very few changes and this version was then defined as late Quenya (c. 1950–1973).|$|E

5|$|The ballads are characterised {{by sexual}} {{encounters}} between everyday people and human(-like) beings {{referred to in}} at least some variants as elves (the same characters also appear as mermen, dwarves, and other kinds of supernatural beings). The elves pose a threat to the everyday community by trying to lure people to into the elves' world. Much the most popular example is Elveskud and its many variants (paralleled in English as Clerk Colvill), where a woman from the elf-world tries to tempt a young knight to join her in dancing, or simply to live among the elves; in some versions he refuses and in some he accepts, but in either case he dies, tragically. As in Elveskud, sometimes the everyday person is a man and the elf a woman, as also in Elvehøj (much the same story as Elveskud, but with a happy ending), Herr Magnus og Bjærgtrolden, Herr Tønne af Alsø, Herr Bøsmer i elvehjem, or the Northern British Thomas the Rhymer. Sometimes the everyday person is a woman and the elf is a man, as in the northern British Tam Lin, The <b>Elfin</b> Knight, and Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight, in which the Elf-Knight bears away Isabel to murder her, or the Scandinavian Harpans kraft. In The Queen of Elfland's Nourice, a woman is abducted to be a wet-nurse to the elf-queen's baby, but promised that she may return home once the child is weaned.|$|E

50|$|The {{subfamily}} Theclinae is a {{group of}} butterflies, including the hairstreaks, <b>elfins</b> and allies, in the family Lycaenidae. There are many tropical species {{as well as a number}} found in the Americas. Tropical hairstreaks often have iridescent blue coloration above, caused by reflected light from the structure of the wing scales rather than by pigment. Hairstreaks from North America are commonly brown above. Few Theclinae are migratory. Members of this group are described as 'thecline'.|$|R
40|$|Historically {{the natural}} habitat for this species was grassy {{openings}} dominated by Andropogon spp. and burned areas in oak barrens and savannas with sandy/rocky soils. Today, the species occurs mostly in open habitats created and maintained by human {{activities such as}} powerline and railroad right of ways, along sand or gravel roads in dry woods and barrens habitats, and around rock outcrops and old gravel pits. Active roadways with host plants are not good habitat because annual spring mowing will kill the larvae, and vehicle traffic will drive off adults. Nearby tree cover is an important habitat component, because it provides shelter from the wind and sun. Adult males tend to congregate in open grassy areas with food plants in cool to moderate weather where they defend grass clumps, but they often move to shady woodland edges at about 82 °F. Frosted <b>elfins</b> occur in two population types, one with caterpillars that feed on lupine (Lupinus perennis), {{and the other with}} caterpillars that feed on wild indigo (Baptisia tinctoria). All populations in Pennsylvania are thought to be wild indigo feeders, even if lupine is also available. Adults are usually found very close to wild indigo plants (e. g. ...|$|R
25|$|After {{the water}} had been mostly removed by a {{lowering}} in the water table, these eroded forms remained and growth began to take hold via stalactites, stalagmites, columns, etc. Some notable formations include the Leaning Column, undermined and tilting like the campanile of Pisa; The Great Stalacpipe Organ, a large shield formation, that was used from very early on as an instrument {{for a variety of}} folk and religious songs; and a vast bed of disintegrated carbonates left by the water in its retreat through the great space called the <b>Elfin</b> Ramble.|$|E
25|$|The {{major threat}} {{for the forest}} {{tinamous}} is deforestation. Neotropical forests are badly affected, with large tracts being clearcut for cropping, pasture or timber plantations. Much of this land is poor in nutrients, so is abandoned {{after a few years}} for newly cleared land. Forest species are consequently forced to adapt, relocate, or die out. As well as the forests, most types of habitat in Middle and South America, apart from the high Andes and Patagonia, are under threat. There is controversy over the vegetative history with speculation that what is now high-altitude grassland in the Andes was once <b>elfin</b> forest.|$|E
25|$|The San Bruno Mountain Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP), {{the first}} of its kind in the United States, was adopted in 1983. Currently, it is the only HCP that {{potentially}} addresses the Bay checkerspot. The plan covers some 3,400acres(14km2) in northern San Mateo County and identifies seven animal species and 44 plant species to be conserved. Among them, the federally endangered Mission blue and the Bay checkerspot butterfly, the Bay checkerspot was not federally listed when the plan was adopted. Thus, this HCP's primary focus is on the two species of butterfly that were federally listed when it was adopted in 1983, the Mission blue butterfly and San Bruno <b>elfin</b> butterfly. The permit for the plan expires on March 31, 2013, and there are currently no provisions in the HCP for incidental take of Bay checkerspots. The Bay checkerspot was lost on San Bruno Mountain around 1986. The impetuses included fires, non-native plant species and natural fluctuations. The reintroduction of the Bay checkerspot is one of the goals of the San Bruno HCP.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} half of the 1970s, the Tasman Series {{continued}} purely as a local series for Formula 5000 racers, but by 1976, the Australian and New Zealand legs fractured apart and the Australian Grand Prix separated from the remnants and became a stand-alone race once more. During this era, the former Tasman stars, Matich, Geoghegan and Bartlett would continue on as a new generation of drivers emerged, some like Garrie Cooper (<b>Elfin)</b> and Graham McRae developing their own cars while others like Max Stewart, John McCormack and Alfredo Costanzo using European-built cars, mostly Lolas. Matich won two Grands Prix is his own cars before Stewart and McRae each took a pair of wins. Towards the end of the 1970s, the race again became a home to returning European-based antipodeans like Alan Jones and Larry Perkins with Warwick Brown winning the 1977 race, while in 1976, touring car racer John Goss completed a remarkable double becoming the only driver to win the Grand Prix and the Bathurst 1000 touring car race.|$|E

500|$|Helvella {{acetabulum}} is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Helvellaceae, order Pezizales. This relatively large cup-shaped fungus {{is characterized by a}} tan fruit body with prominent branching ribs resembling a cabbage leaf; for this reason it is commonly known as the cabbage leaf Helvella. Other colloquial names include the vinegar cup and the brown ribbed <b>elfin</b> cup. The fruit bodies reaches dimensions of [...] by [...] tall. It is found in Asia, Europe, and North America, where it grows in sandy soils, under both coniferous and deciduous trees. Although it may be considered edible, the fungus is not recommended for consumption unless cooked thoroughly, as it contains the toxin gyromitrin.|$|E
500|$|The genus name {{is derived}} from the Greek words gyros/γυρος [...] "round" [...] and mitra/μιτρα [...] "headband"; the {{specific}} epithet is [...] from the Latin infǔla, a heavy band of twisted wool worn by Roman officiants at sacrifices. It is known more commonly as the <b>elfin</b> saddle or the hooded false morel. Additionally, G.infula is a member of a group of fungi collectively known as [...] "false morels", so named for their resemblance to the highly regarded edible true morels of the genus Morchella.

500|$|Elves entered {{early modern}} elite culture most {{clearly in the}} {{literature}} of Elizabethan England. Here Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene (1590–) used fairy and elf interchangeably of human-sized beings, but they are complex imaginary and allegorical figures. Spenser also presented his own explanation of the origins of the Elfe and <b>Elfin</b> kynd, claiming that they were created by Prometheus. Likewise, William Shakespeare, in a speech in Romeo and Juliet (1592) has an [...] "elf-lock" [...] (tangled hair) being caused Queen Mab, who is referred to as [...] "the fairies' midwife". Meanwhile, A Midsummer Night's Dream promoted the idea that elves were diminutive and etherial. The influence of Shakespeare and Michael Drayton made the use of elf and fairy for very small beings the norm, and had a lasting effect seen in fairy tales about elves, collected in the modern period.|$|E
500|$|Gyromitra infula, {{commonly}} known as the hooded false morel or the <b>elfin</b> saddle, is a fungus in the family Helvellaceae. The dark reddish-brown caps of the fruit bodies develop a characteristic saddle-shape in maturity, and the ends of both saddle lobes are drawn out to sharp tips that project above the level of the fruit body. The stipe is white or flushed pale brown, smooth on the outside, but hollow with some chambers inside. It is found in the Northern Hemisphere, usually in the late summer and autumn, growing on rotting wood or on hard packed ground. G.infula is considered inedible as it contains the toxic compound gyromitrin, which, when metabolized by the body, is converted into monomethylhydrazine, a component of some rocket fuels. The toxin may be removed by thorough cooking. Gyromitra fungi are included in the informal category [...] "false morels".|$|E
