25|$|Interactivity can be {{considered}} a central concept in understanding new media, but different media forms possess, or enable different degrees of interactivity, and some forms of digitized and converged media are not in fact interactive at all. Tony Feldman considers digital satellite television {{as an example of a}} new media technology that uses digital compression to dramatically increase the number of television channels that can be delivered, and which changes the nature of what can be offered through the service, but does not transform the experience of television from the user's point of view, and thus lacks a more fully interactive dimension. It remains the case that interactivity is not an <b>inherent</b> <b>characteristic</b> of all new media technologies, unlike digitization and convergence.|$|E

30|$|First, quality {{evaluation}} {{comes down to}} the definition of quality. The concept of quality has gone through numerous evolutions; the most authoritative definition to date proposed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is as follows: ‘Degree to which a set of <b>inherent</b> <b>characteristics</b> fulfill requirements’ (ISO [2000]). Hence, <b>inherent</b> <b>characteristics</b> and requirement fulfilling are theoretical foundations for {{quality evaluation}} (Juran and Godfrey [2003]).|$|R

500|$|The {{average height}} at the withers is [...] Height {{should not be}} more than about taller horses may seem coarse. Chestnut {{is the most common}} colour, {{followed}} by bay, grey and dun. Dun horses may have primitive markings, a dorsal stripe and zebra stripes on the legs. The black color does not appear in the breed. [...] Skewbald patterns can occur. The Kathiawari has a concave facial profile, with a broad forehead and short muzzle. The neck and body are proportional and relatively short, while both the head and tail are carried high. Although well-proportioned, many Western breeders consider them to be lacking in bone in the legs. However, soundness is an <b>inherent</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the breed. One of the breed's most distinctive features is its ears, which curve inward to touch and sometimes overlap at the tips. The Kathiawari has the most extremely curved ears of any breed of horse. At some points in the breed's history, breeders focused on the preservation of these curving ears, to the detriment of some other, more important, physical characteristics. Like many desert breeds, the Kathiawari can subsist on minimal rations and water and is more resistant to the heat than breeds developed in colder climates. As well as the usual gaits, the Kathiawari also performs a swift, lateral pace, called the revaal. It is a high-spirited, intelligent and affectionate horse.|$|E
2500|$|A {{dedicated}} MAT {{has been}} found to be dispensable for polyketide production under in vitro conditions. The PKS may [...] "borrow" [...] the MAT from its own fatty acid synthase and this may be the primary way ACP receives its malonate group in DXR biosynthesis. [...] Additionally, there is excellent evidence [...] that [...] "self-malonylation" [...] is an <b>inherent</b> <b>characteristic</b> of Type II ACPs. [...] In summary, a given Type II PKS may provide its own MAT (s), it may borrow one from FAS, or its ACP may “self-malonylate”.|$|E
2500|$|He had {{an abiding}} {{confidence}} in the natural, untutored instinct for rightness and beauty in the average person: [...] "all men have {{sense of what is}} right in this matter, if they would only use and apply this sense; every man knows where and how beauty gives him pleasure, if he would only ask for it when he does so, and not allow it to be forced upon him when he does not want it." [...] This contrasts with the thread of modernism that holds that people must be taught to appreciate good design. Another contrast with modernism is in the aesthetic of functionality: Ruskin saw no beauty in well-designed tools: beauty is out of place where there is not serene leisure, or [...] "if you thrust it into the places of toil. Put it in the drawing-room, not into the workshop; put it on domestic furniture, not upon tools of handicraft." [...] For Ruskin, Beauty was not an <b>inherent</b> <b>characteristic</b> but a thing that could be applied to an object or withheld from it.|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} use of variable speed compressors (VSC) in refrigeration systems can potentially lead to the unstable operation when compressor speed is varied {{from time to time}} for capacity control. The causes of unstable operation may be classified into two groups, one relating to control algorithms and the other to the <b>inherent</b> <b>characteristics</b> of systems. This paper reports on a study on the operational stability of a VSC refrigeration system due to its <b>inherent</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Based on experimental results, a new modified minimal stable superheat (MSS) line having a maximum MSS value and a minimal MSS value has been proposed. Using the modified MSS line, and supported by a series of purposely designed experiments, a detailed analysis on the operational stability of a VSC refrigeration system due to its <b>inherent</b> <b>characteristics</b> when its compressor speed is changed for capacity control has been carried out and presented.

2500|$|In October 1666 two {{fishermen}} {{caught a}} huge female shark {{near the town}} of Livorno, and Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, ordered its head to be sent to Steno. Steno dissected the head and published his findings in 1667. He noted that the shark's teeth bore a striking resemblance to certain stony objects, found embedded within rock formations, that his learned contemporaries were calling glossopetrae or [...] "tongue stones". Ancient authorities, such as the Roman author Pliny the Elder, in his Naturalis Historia, had suggested that these stones fell from the sky or from the Moon. Others were of the opinion, also following ancient authors, that fossils naturally grew in the rocks. Steno's contemporary Athanasius Kircher, for example, attributed fossils to a [...] "lapidifying virtue diffused through the whole body of the geocosm", considered an <b>inherent</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the earth – an Aristotelian approach. Fabio Colonna, however, had already shown in a convincing way that glossopetrae are shark teeth, in his treatise De glossopetris dissertatio published in 1616. Steno added to Colonna's theory a discussion on the differences in composition between glossopetrae and living sharks' teeth, arguing that the chemical composition of fossils could be altered without changing their form, using the contemporary corpuscular theory of matter.|$|E
6000|$|Failure to {{recognize}} that the American, is at heart an idealist is to lack understanding of our national character. Two of our greatest interpreters proclaimed it, Emerson and William James. In a recent address at the Paris Sorbonne on [...] "American Idealism," [...] M. Firmin Roz observed that a people is rarely justly estimated by its contemporaries. The French, he says, have been celebrated chiefly for the skill of their chefs and their vaudeville actors, while in the disturbed 'speculum mundi' Americans have appeared as a collection of money grabbers whose philosophy is the dollar. It remained for the war to reveal the true nature of both peoples. The American colonists, M. Roz continues, unlike other colonists, were animated not by material motives, but by the desire to safeguard and realize an ideal; our <b>inherent</b> <b>characteristic</b> today is a belief in the virtue and power of ideas, of a national, indeed, of a universal, mission. In the Eighteenth Century we proposed a Philosophy and adopted a Constitution far in advance of the political practice of the day, and set up a government of which Europe predicted the early downfall. Nevertheless, thanks partly to good fortune, and to the farseeing wisdom of our early statesmen who perceived that the success of our experiment depended upon the maintenance of an isolation from European affairs, we established democracy as a practical form of government.|$|E
