5|$|Jim Carrey was {{considered}} for the part of Jack Sparrow. However, the production schedule for The Curse of the Black Pearl conflicted with Bruce Almighty. Others {{considered for the}} role include Michael Keaton and Christopher Walken. Although Cook had been a strong proponent of adapting Disney's rides into films, the box office failure of The Country Bears (2002) made Michael Eisner attempt to shut down production of Pirates of the Caribbean. However, Verbinski told his concept artists to <b>keep</b> <b>working</b> on the picture, and when Eisner came to visit, the executive was astonished by what had been created.|$|E
5|$|Chester {{had planned}} to retire in June 2009, and the {{congregation}} embarked on {{a search for a}} new senior rabbi in 2008. Twenty-three candidates were narrowed down to one finalist, but in early December that individual informed the search committee that he was withdrawing his name from consideration. While the search was progressing, Chester had realized that, due to the 2008 financial crisis, he would have to <b>keep</b> <b>working.</b> After the main candidate withdrew, the synagogue's president approached Chester, asking if he would stay on for another term, which Chester agreed to do. Chester retired in June 2011, becoming (along with Broude) Rabbi Emeritus.|$|E
5|$|Lancashire {{monitored}} MacLaren's progress {{during his}} time at Harrow. When his season there ended in 1890, he was selected to play for Lancashire in the County Championship. Making his first-class debut on 14 August 1890 in a match against Sussex, he scored 108 runs on a difficult pitch in a relatively fast time of two hours. Although less successful in the remaining games of the season, he finished fourth in the Lancashire averages with 140 runs {{at an average of}} 23.33. MacLaren's financial circumstances forced him to <b>keep</b> <b>working</b> at the District Bank, limiting the amount of cricket he played in 1891 and 1892.|$|E

5|$|The Comet had a {{total of}} four {{hydraulic}} systems, two primaries, one secondary, and a final emergency system for basic functions such as lowering the undercarriage. The undercarriage could also be lowered by a combination of gravity and a hand-pump. Power was syphoned from all four engines for the hydraulics, cabin air conditioning, and the de-icing system; these systems had operational redundancy in that they could <b>keep</b> <b>working</b> even if only a single engine was active. The majority of hydraulic components were centred in a single avionics bay. A pressurised refuelling system, developed by Flight Refuelling Ltd, allowed the Comet's fuel tanks to be refuelled at a far greater rate than other methods.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I <b>keep</b> <b>working</b> on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E

25|$|To {{avoid the}} {{appearance}} of slavery, however, Dessalines abolished the ultimate symbol of slavery, the whip. Likewise, the working day was shortened by a third. Dessalines' chief motivator nonetheless was production and to this aim he granted much freedom to the plantations' overseers. Barred from using the whip, many instead turned to lianes, which were thick vines abundant throughout the island, to persuade the laborers to <b>keep</b> <b>working.</b> Dessalines effectively sent the Haitian people back into slavery. Nevertheless, he succeeded in rebuilding much of the countryside and in raising production levels.|$|E

Even so, Eva is determined to run for vice-president, and Perón fears that the military will stage a coup if she runs and that Eva's health is too delicate for any stressful work, but Eva insists she can continue, despite her failing health ("Dice Are Rolling/Eva's Sonnet").|$|E

25|$|Macri {{intended}} {{to run for}} chairman of Boca Juniors in 1991, but his father convinced him to <b>keep</b> <b>working</b> at Sevel. He tried to buy the Deportivo Español team, but could not get support from the team's board of directors. Macri supported Boca Juniors, paying coach César Luis Menotti's salary and buying players for the team (including Rubén Perazzo). Franco, skeptical about his son's prospects for success, finally allowed him to run Boca Juniors. He instructed aide Orlando Salvestrini to work with Mauricio for two reasons: to help him and to monitor his activities. Mauricio met with former Boca Juniors chairmen Antonio Alegre and Carlos Heller, and tried to convince them to work with him; both rebuffed him. Macri later sought the support of other groups in Boca Juniors, eventually winning the team's internal elections.|$|E
25|$|The NCB was {{encouraged}} to gear itself toward reduced subsidies in the early 1980s. After a strike was narrowly averted in February 1981, pit closures and pay restraint led to unofficial strikes. The main strike started on 6 March 1984 with a walkout at Cortonwood Colliery, {{which led to the}} NUM's Yorkshire area's sanctioning of a strike on the grounds of a ballot result from 1981 in the Yorkshire Area, which was later challenged in court. The union strategy was to cause a severe energy shortage of the sort that had won victory in the 1972 strike. The government strategy, designed by Margaret Thatcher, was threefold: to build up ample coal stocks, to keep as many miners at work as possible, and to use police to break up attacks by pickets on working miners. The critical element was the NUM's failure to hold a strike ballot, which enabled a minority to <b>keep</b> <b>working</b> and kept other unions from supporting it.|$|E

500|$|One of Vargas Llosa's {{more recent}} novels, The Way to Paradise (El paraíso en la otra esquina), is set largely in France and Tahiti.

Unfortunately, Vargas Llosa was not as successful in transforming these historical figures into fiction.
