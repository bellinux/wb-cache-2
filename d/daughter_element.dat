50|$|All {{forms of}} {{isochron}} dating {{assume that the}} source of the rock or rocks contained unknown amounts of both radiogenic and non-radiogenic isotopes of the <b>daughter</b> <b>element,</b> along with some amount of the parent nuclide. Thus, at the moment of crystallization, the ratio of the concentration of the radiogenic isotope of the <b>daughter</b> <b>element</b> to that of the non-radiogenic isotope is some value independent of the concentration of the parent. As time goes on, some amount of the parent decays into the radiogenic isotope of the daughter, increasing the ratio of the concentration of the radiogenic isotope to that of the daughter. The greater the initial concentration of the parent, the greater the concentration of the radiogenic daughter isotope will be at some particular time. Thus, the ratio of the daughter to non-radiogenic isotope will become larger with time, while the ratio of parent to daughter will become smaller. For rocks that start out with a small concentration of the parent, the daughter/non-radiogenic ratio will not change quickly as compared to rocks starting with a large concentration of the parent.|$|E
50|$|Isochron dating is {{a common}} {{technique}} of radiometric dating and is applied to date certain events, such as crystallization, metamorphism, shock events, and differentiation of precursor melts, {{in the history of}} rocks. Isochron dating can be further separated into mineral isochron dating and whole rock isochron dating; both techniques are applied frequently to date terrestrial and also extraterrestrial rocks (meteorites). The advantage of isochron dating as compared to simple radiometric dating techniques is that no assumptions are needed about the initial amount of the daughter nuclide in the radioactive decay sequence. Indeed, the initial amount of the daughter product can be determined using isochron dating. This technique can be applied if the <b>daughter</b> <b>element</b> has at least one stable isotope other than the daughter isotope into which the parent nuclide decays.|$|E

The DNA copies are often subject to recombination once {{integrated into the}} genome. Complex elements, where two elements share an LTR, are not uncommon.

Results Here, we present evidence for another potential mechanism {{for the creation of}} complex elements, involving abnormal template switching during reverse transcription. The template switching creates a large, complex <b>daughter</b> <b>element,</b> formed by the fusion of two parent sequences, which is then inserted into the genome.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to establish links between groundwater quality, groundwater residence times, and regional geology in the St. Lawrence Lowlands fractured bedrock aquifer. The study focuses on a 4500 km 2 watershed located in the St. Lawrence Lowlands of the province of Quebec in eastern Canada. A total of 150 wells were sampled for major, minor, and trace ions. Tritium (3 H) and its <b>daughter</b> <b>element,</b> 3 He, as well as radiocarbon activity (A 14 C) were measured in a subset of wells to estimate groundwater residence times. Results show that groundwater evolves from a Ca–HCO 3 water type in recharge zones (i. e., the Appalachian piedmont) to a Na–HCO 3 water type downgradient, toward the St. Lawrence River. Locally, barium (Ba), fluoride (F), iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn) concentrations reach 90, 2, 18, and 5. 9 mg/L respectively, all exceeding their respective Canadian drinking water limits of 1, 1. 5, 0. 3, and 0. 05 mg/L. Release of these elements into groundwater is mainly controlled by the groundwater redox state and pH conditions, as well as by the geology and the duration of rock–water interactions. This evolution is accompanied by increasing 3 H/ 3 He ages, from 4. 78 ± 0. 44 years upgradient to more than 60 years downgradient. Discrepancies between calculated 3 H/ 3 He and 14 C water ages (the latter ranging from 280 ± 56 to 17, 050 ± 3410 years) suggest mixing between modern water and paleo-groundwater infiltrated through subglacial recharge when the Laurentide Ice Sheet covered the study area, and during the following deglaciation period. A linear relationship between 3 H activity and corrected 14 C versus Mg/Ca and Ba support a direct link between water residence time and the chemical evolution of these waters. The Ba, F, Fe, and Mn concentrations in groundwater originate from Paleozoic rocks from both the St. Lawrence Platform and the Appalachian Mountains. These elements have been brought to the surface by rising hydrothermal fluids along regional faults, and trapped in sediment during their deposition and diagenesis due to reactions with highly sulfurous and organic matter-rich water. Large-scale flow of meltwater during subglacial recharge and during the subsequent retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet might have contributed to the leaching of these deposits and their enrichment in the present aquifers.

In other careful experiments conducted over a period of many months they find that they are unable to confirm the element 102 discovery work of Fields et al. reported in 1957. The experiments at Berkeley were performed with the new heavy ion linear accelerator (HILAC) {{over a period of several}} weeks and culinated the chemical identification of an isotope of fermium (Fm{sup 250 }) as the daughter of an alpha-particle-emitting isotope of element 102 (102 {sup 254 }). The method used to detect the isotope of element 102 was essentially a continuous milking experiment wherein the atoms of the <b>daughter</b> <b>element</b> 100 were separated from the parent element 102 by taking advantage of the recoil due to the element 102 alpha particle decay. The target consisted of a mixture of isotopes of curium (95 % Cm{sup 244 } and 4. 5 % Cm{sup 246 }) mounted on a very thin nickel foil. The target was approximately 0. 5 mg/cm{sup 2 } thick and was covered with 75 {micro}gm/cm{sup 2 } aluminum to prevent curium 'knockover'. The curium was bombarded with mono-energetic C{sup 12 } ions at energies from 60 to 100 Mev. The transmuted atoms were knocked into helium gas to absorb the considerable recoil energy. It was found that with a sufficient electric field strength practically all of these positively charged atoms could be attracted to a moving negatively charged metallic belt placed directly beneath the target. These atoms would then be carried on this conveyer belt under a foil which was charged negatively relative to the belt. Approximately half of the atoms undergoing alpha decay would cause their daughter atoms to recoil from the surface of the belt to the catcher foil. The catcher foil was cut transversely to the direction of the belt motion into five equal length sections after a time of bombardement suited to the half-life of the daughter atom to be examined. The five foils were then alpha-pulse-analyzed simultaneously in a multiplex assembly consisting of five Frisch grid chambers, amplifiers, a single Wilkinson type 'kick-sorter', and a printer. With this equipment it was easily possible to make all the desired measurements for identifying the atoms caught on the catcher foils and thus to measure the half-life of the parent of the recoiling atoms. The method was first successfully used in bombardments of Pu{sup 240 } with C{sup 12 } ions to identify a new isotope of element 100, Fm{sup 248 }.

40|$|Factors {{controlling}} closure in the biotite Rb-Sr {{system were}} investigated in a {{detailed study of}} an amphibolite-facies metacarbonate from the central Swiss Alps. Oxygen isotope {{data suggest that the}} rock cooled as a closed system. Calcite- dolomite thermometry temperatures of similar to 450 degreesC to 500 degreesC and feldspar thermometry temperatures of similar to 300 degreesC to 400 degreesC provide evidence of extensive Ca-Mg and Na-K exchange during cooling. Biotite in the sample is 90 mol. % phlogopite and has high Rb (similar to 900 ppm) compared to Sr (similar to 0. 3 ppm), giving precise Rb-Sr ages. Carefully separated and sized phlogopite shows a range of Rb-Sr ages that do not simply decrease with grain size as predicted by current models of closure temperature. Rb-Sr ages decrease from 18. 1 Ma to 16. 6 Ma with a decrease in mean grain diameter from 1. 16 mm to 0. 74 mm, but grains with mean diameter of 0. 54 mm show an increase again to 17. 6 Ma. This contrasts with Ar-Ar data for single phlogopites, which do show a decrease in age with decreasing grain size. The Rb-Sr age pattern is due to Rb- loss during cooling, which is most pronounced in the finest fraction. The phlogopites are restricted to a a-cm-thick layer in calcite marble; Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 of the calcite decreases away from the phlogopite band over 4 cm, indicating that the calcite was moving towards Sr-isotope equilibration with the phlogopites over this distance and that the phlogopite was not equilibrating with an "infinite reservoir. " Ion microprobe traverses across grains of different minerals reveal systematic core-rim variations in major and trace element concentrations. In particular, Sr decreases from calcite core to rim, but increases from core to rim in K-feldspar, whereas Rb decreases from core to rim in phlogopite but also increases from core to rim in K-feldspar. These gradients are interpreted as indicating the direction of transport of elements during cooling as a result of cation exchange reactions; calcite and phlogopite were sources for Sr and Rb, respectively, whereas K- feldspar acted as a sink for both elements. This chemical equilibration was taking {{place at the same time}} as isotopic equilibration during cooling, and was equally important in controlling the apparent ages recorded by the mica grains. In contrast, closure temperature calculations for geochronological systems based on classic Dodsontype models assume parent and <b>daughter</b> <b>element</b> concentrations are homogeneous across grains and do not change with time, only isotopic exchange is modeled. Closure in mica Rb-Sr systems will depend both on the factors that control isotopic exchange (grain size, mode, Sr- 87 diffusion coefficients) and those that control chemical exchange (grain size, mode, Rb and Sr diffusion coefficients, Rb and Sr contents of phases and their partition coefficients) ...|$|E

The nuclear medicine department performs both diagnostic tests and therapies using open radiation sources whereas the diagnostic use currently prevails.

Using a scintillation detector, which is incorporated in a gamma camera, {{the distribution of the}} radiopharmaceutical in the target tissue can be observed, either after {{a certain period of time}} from the administration of the radiopharmaceutical (static scintigraphy) or over time (dynamic scintigraphy). One of the most common examinations performed at the nuclear medicine department is bone scintigraphy. The examination is carried out using osteotropic radiopharmaceutical that binds to bones, thus revealing pathologies caused by the change of metabolic activity. The examination in itself takes place through external detection of the administered radiopharmaceutical. Bone scintigraphy is a very useful examination that is used to detect bone metastases in cancer diseases, to diagnose primary malignant bone tumors, to detect infectious processes in the bones, to diagnose joint diseases, metabolic diseases of the skeleton, and bone injuries. The examination in itself is performed by using radiopharmaceuticals. Once administered, the radiopharmaceutical serves as a diagnostic indicator. This is a medicine that incorporates a radionuclide that emits ionizing radiation. The radionuclides used in nuclear medicine are artificially prepared and transported either as ready-to-use products or as radionuclide generators to the nuclear medicine department. The generator that is the most commonly used at the nuclear medicine department is the 99 Mo/ 99 mTc generator. The above mentioned radionuclide generator consists of a glass chromatography column which is located in a lead shielding cylinder. The column contains the adsorbent material (alumina) in which the parent radionuclide is adsorbed. Due to different chemical properties of the parent and the <b>daughter</b> <b>element</b> the daughter radionuclide can be washed out (eluted) by means of a suitable solution. In practice, the radiopharmaceuticals are commonly prepared using kits that are commercially available. The kits are labeled by using sodium pertechnetate solution obtained from the 99 Mo/ 99 mTc generator. Prior to the administration of the radiopharmaceutical to the patient it is necessary to carry out the determination of radiochemical purity. The most commonly used is a paper chromatography and thin layer chromatography. In the Czech Republic, 99 mTc labelled diphosphonates (e. g. the kits TechneScan HDP, 6 -MDP or 8 -MDP are used for bone scintigraphy. These osteotropic radiopharmaceuticals are prepared in a shielded laminar box in the radiopharmaceutical laboratory at the nuclear medicine department. The preparation is subject to the manufacturer's instructions. After preparation, prior to administration to the patient, the determination of radiochemical purity needs to be performed. The determination of radiochemical purity of the radiopharmaceutical TechneScan HDP is carried out by using thin layer chromatography (ITLC-SG) by means of 13. 6 % solution of sodium acetate and methyl ethyl ketone as eluent. However, this determination is demanding for the normal operation of the department in terms of design as well as costs. Therefore, a suitable alternative method was sought. The new method consists in paper chromatography by using 0. 9 % solution of sodium chloride and acetone as eluent.

This approach offers far more leverage than any other short-lived nuclide system because: 1. the half-life of 9 Myrs is ideal for accretionary timescales; 2. both parent and <b>daughter</b> <b>elements</b> are highly refractory and in known, chondritic proportions in the Earth; 3. the initial 182 Hf atomic abundance {{at the start of}} the solar system was relatively high; and 4. Hf and W are strongly fractionated by the early processes of melting and core formation. In this paper we review in detail the basic systematics of W isotope geochemistry and then discuss the presently available data for more than 80 meteorites and lunar samples in the context of various kinds of accretionary and core formation models. Tungsten isotope data are now available for metals from 30 iron meteorites and 8 ordinary chondrites, as measured by MC-ICPMS and N-TIMS and demonstrate a ubiquitous and well defined deficiency in the range 200 to 500 ppm in the 182 W/ 184 W of early segregated metals relative to that found in bulk carbonaceous chondrites. This deficiency, together with Hf-W internal isochrons for ordinary chondrites and theoretical predictions from modeling 182 Hf as a product of the same processes that produce the actinide elements, all yield the same result, that the 182 Hf/ 180 Hf {{at the start of the}} solar syste...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Technetium {{isotopes}} 97 Tc, 98 Tc and 99 Tc decay to 97 Mo, 98 Ru and 99 Ru, with half-lives of 2. 6 My, 4. 1 My, and 0. 21 My respectively. If {{there were}} early solar system processes {{that resulted in}} significant fractionation of Tc from the <b>daughter</b> <b>elements,</b> decay of extant Tc could {{have led to the}} creation of Mo and Ru isotopic heterogeneities. To assess the potential of metallic core crystallization to fractionate these elements, we examine the partitioning behavior of Tc relative to Re, Mo and Ru in the Fe-Ni-S system between solid metal and liquid metal alloy. The experimental evidence shows that Tc behaves more like the modestly compatible siderophile element Ru than the more highly compatible siderophile element Re, and that Tc is substantially more compatible than Mo. We also demonstrate a pressure effect in the partitioning of Mo during the crystallization of Fe-Ni-S melts. For a sulfur concentration in the liquid fraction of the core of 10 wt % (16. 3 at%), the Jones and Malvin (1990) parameter is ln(1 – 2 1. 09 0. 163) 0. 44, which yields: D(Re) 4. 1; D(Ru) 2. 3; D(Tc) 1. 7; D(Mo) Lo-P 1. 0;. and D(Mo) Hi-P 0. 5. Our results suggest that detectable Tc-induced isotopic anomalies (0. 1 unit) in Ru and Mo could only be produced by unrealis-tically extreme degrees of crystallization of metal during asteroidal core fractionation, regardless of the time scales and initial Tc abundances involved.

2500|$|In 1906, Hahn {{returned}} to Germany, where he collaborated with Emil Fischer at the University of Berlin. Fischer placed {{at his disposal}} a former woodworking shop ("Holzwerkstatt") in the Chemical Institute to use as his own laboratory. There, {{in the space of}} a few months, using extremely primitive apparatus, Hahn discovered mesothorium I, mesothorium II, and – independently from Bertram Boltwood – the mother substance of radium, ionium (later identified as thorium-230). In subsequent years, mesothorium I (radium-228) assumed great importance because, like radium-226 (discovered by Pierre and Marie Curie), it was ideally suited for use in medical radiation treatment, while costing only half as much to manufacture. Wilson wrote in his Rutherford biography:Hahn was rapidly carving out his place as the world's leading radio-chemist, with a series of new discoveries of radioactive <b>daughter</b> <b>elements.</b> He also showed a wisdom and humour which impressed Rutherford, for when the New Zealander suggested [...] "paradium" [...] as the name for one of Hahn's newly discovered elements - meaning [...] "parallel to radium" [...] - Hahn rejected the suggestion on the grounds that the name was too reminiscent of military activity and goose-stepping.In 1914, for the discovery of mesothorium I (radium-228), Otto Hahn was first nominated for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry by Adolf von Baeyer and, in June 1907, by means of the traditional habilitation thesis, Hahn qualified to teach at the University of Berlin. On 28 September 1907 he made the acquaintance of the Austrian physicist Lise Meitner who was almost the same age, who had transferred from Vienna to Berlin. So began the thirty-year collaboration and lifelong close friendship between the two scientists.|$|R

Phrasal word order is determined within locally definable word order domains, which are ordered sequences of constituents. 2. Phrasal word order domains are composed compositionally from their daughter word order domains. 3. Lexical entries do not have word order domains. 4. The functor of a phrasal constituent is an element of its mother's domain. 5. Either (a) a nonfunctor <b>daughter</b> is an <b>element</b> of its mother's domain, or (b) the elements of a nonfunctor <b>daughter's</b> domain are <b>elements</b> of its mother's domain, and furthermore they may appear discontinuously or nonadjacently in the mother's domain [...] - provided the relative order of the <b>elements</b> of the <b>daughter</b> domain are preserved in the mother's domain.
