Involving a software team frequently for changing the business policies is not a good idea. Such needs can be catered using rule engine. Business rules can be written separately from the application code using rule engine which makes it easy for a business user to change the rules as and when needed without the help of a programmer. Traditionally, rule engines are designed to work on high-end processors, having them on a low-end processor is a big challenge. In this era we are dealing with palmtops and iPhones, which are going to replace the bulky desktops even for computational purposes.

The algorithm generates {{one or more}} decision trees that determine what rules or triggers might be enabled by an individual database element, {{reducing the number of}} rules or triggers that must be evaluated. The algorithm operates by symbolically representing the space of database elements and subdividing the space based on rule predicates. Regions of the state space represent particular combinations of enabled rules. Decision trees are then generated based on the subdivided state space. The trees have the important property that no individual test is repeated. The ordered binary decision diagram (BDD) data structure is used to represent and manipulate the state space. 1.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the role}} of the main international actors involved in the implementation of police reform in post-conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina, notably that of the UN and the EU. Despite considerable efforts and resources deployed over 17 years, the implementation of police reform remains an ‘unfinished business’ that demonstrates the slow pace of <b>implementing</b> <b>rule</b> of law reforms in Bosnia’s post-conflict setting, yet, in the long-term, remains vital for Bosnia’s stability and post-conflict reconstruction process. Starting with a presentation of the status of the police before and after the conflict, UN reforms (1995 – 2002) are first discussed in order to set the stage for an analysis of {{the role of}} the EU in the implementation of police reform. Here, particular emphasis is placed on the institution-building actions of the EU police mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina deployed on the ground for almost a decade (2003 -June 2012). The article concludes with an overall assessment of UN and EU efforts in post-conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the remaining challenges encountered by the EU on the ground, as the current leader to police reform implementation efforts. More generally, the article highlights that for police reform to succeed in the long-term, from 2012 -onwards, the EU should pay particular attention to the political level, where most of the stumbling blocks for the implementation of police reform lie...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{this research}} was to classify flower plant diseases by <b>implementing</b> <b>Rule</b> Based technique. There were several types of flower plants and diseases were conducted for this research which were six types of flower plants and seven types of diseases. Orchid, Hibiscus, Sunflower, Roses, Daylily and Jasmine were the six types of flower plant while black spot, insects, leaf spot, mildew, microorganism, rust and sooty mold were the diseases that are covered in this research. This system consisted of two users or actors which interact within it which were the owner of Rumpun Damai Nursery itself and the staff. Currently, {{the management of the}} nursery regarding the diseases infected to the plant are unorganized. This was because of some factors such as lack of knowledge regarding the flower plant diseases among the owner and staff at the nursery. Therefore, in order to solved those problem, the objective have been identified that lead to the conducting of this research. This classification system can help the owner and staff at Rumpun Damai Nursery to identify flower plant diseases. In order to apply Rule Based technique in this research, the data regarding the flower plant and diseases need to gathered first and undergo preprocessing method.

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} “INSPIRE data specification on Natural Risk Zones – Guidelines” version 2. 0 as {{developed by the}} Thematic Working Group (TWG) Natural Risk Zones using both natural and a conceptual schema language. This version is now available for the public consultation. Based {{on the results of}} the consultation (received comments and the testing reports), the final version 3. 0 will be prepared by the TWGs. The data specification is based on a common template used for all data specifications and has been harmonised using the experience from the development of the Annex I data specifications. This document provides guidelines for the implementation of the provisions laid down in the draft <b>Implementing</b> <b>Rule</b> for spatial data sets and services of the INSPIRE Directive. This document includes two executive summaries that provide a quick overview of the INSPIRE data specification process in general, and the content of the data specification on Natural Risk Zones in particular. We highly recommend that managers, decision makers, and all those new to the INSPIRE process and/or information modelling should read these executive summaries first. The UML diagrams (in Chapter 5) offer a rapid way to see the main elements of the specifications and their relationships. The definition of the spatial object types, attributes, and relationships are included in the Feature Catalogue (also in Chapter 5). People having thematic expertise but not familiar with UML can fully understand the content of the data model focusing on the Feature Catalogue. Users might also find the Feature Catalogue especially useful to check if it contains the data necessary for the applications that they run. The technical details are expected to be of prime interest to those organisations that are/will be responsible for implementing INSPIRE within the field of Natural Risk Zones. The technical provisions and the underlying concepts are often illustrated by examples. Smaller examples are within the text of the specification, while longer explanatory examples and descriptions of selected use cases are attached in the annexes. In order to distinguish the INSPIRE spatial data themes from the spatial object types, the INSPIRE spatial data themes are written in italics...|$|E
40|$|Section 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act and its <b>implementing</b> <b>Rule</b> 10 b- 5 are {{the primary}} antifraud {{provisions}} for {{both private and public}} enforcement of the federal securities laws. Neither the statute nor the rule expressly provides for a private right of action, but federal courts have long recognized such an implied right, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has supported the implied private right of action as a “necessary supplement” to its own efforts. However, after a decade of applying an expansive interpretation to Section 10 (b), in the early 1970 s the U. S. Supreme Court began to narrowly interpret this implied private right of action, citing concerns about the costs that frivolous litigation may impose on capital markets. Most recently, in Janus Capital Group, Inc. v. First Derivative Traders, the Supreme Court constricted the ambit of Rule 10 b- 5 (b) — which imposes liability for fraudulent misstatements — by narrowly interpreting the word “make” in a way that effectively removes entire categories of plaintiffs from liability under Rule 10 b- 5 (b). While Janus involved private plaintiffs, the Court’s interpretation cannot easily be distinguished {{on the basis of the}} plaintiff’s identity. Therefore, Janus appears to limit the Commission to the same extent that it does private plaintiffs, even if such a limitation was not the Court’s intent. This Note offers a solution to the Commission’s Janus problem, whereby the Commission could use its rulemaking authority to implement a “New Rule 10 b- 5. ” This New Rule 10 b- 5 would be drafted so that only the Commission could use it to prosecute fraud, addressing the Court’s concern about the potential costs of expanding private litigation. Additionally, the New Rule 10 b- 5 could substitute different language for the word “make” so that the Commission could sidestep the Court’s restrictive interpretation of that word’s meaning. Going forward, this bifurcated approach to Section 10 (b) — with separate rules for private and public enforcement — would allow the courts to interpret the contours of each cause of action without inadvertently restricting or expanding the scope of the other...|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} {{developed}} {{to predict the}} amount of fertilizer substances for gardening by <b>implementing</b> <b>Rule</b> Based Technique. Rimbun Ventures Nursery is chosen as stakeholder for this project, which is located at Taman Pulai Flora, Johor Bahru, Johor where it’s near to Pulai Spring Resort and Technology Park University Technology Malaysia (UTM). There are few users of this system which are {{the owner of the}} nursery itself, the gardener and the other users in related area of knowledge. Currently, there is very few system that predict the amount of fertilizer substances to be used, this lead to several problems such as flower plant stunted growth because of lacking nutrient, misuse type of fertilizer and fertilizer amount used over or understated. In order to minimize this problem, the objectives had been identified for conducting and monitoring this research. This prediction system helps the nursery by providing the suggestion on the fertilizer amount needs for flower plant, according to the uncertainty attributes such as the age of flower plant, temperature (Celcius), water requirement and soil pH value. The Rule Based technique was chosen to analyze and produce the rules from the data that have been gathered from the expert knowledge. Beforehand, the data have to undergo data pre-processing phase in order to clean, transform, reduce and smooth the raw data. Based on the data that have been pre-processed, the uncertainty attributes were divided into several categories to ease the rules produced such age of flower plant that has been categorized into threes according to its height, which are small, medium and large. From the rules, the system can suggest a few suggested percentages of the fertilizer amount needed for flower plants. The rules embedded into the prototype system to demonstrate on how the rules functioning. Therefore, the type of fertilizer to be used also being suggested according to soil pH values. In order to control the entire process involved, a waterfall methodology has been chosen. Even though this project have been completed, {{there is a lot of}} enhancement that can be done to improve such as within the scope of this research on covering the other type of plants such as herb, fruit and vegetables. Furthermore, this prototype system platform also can be changed into mobile applications for more easy and quick uses as well as can address the need of the testing phase. In conclusion, this research proved to be beneficial not only for the stakeholder but also for the other users...|$|E
