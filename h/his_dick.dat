500|$|Escape was {{recorded}} in 16 days at Battery Studios in London, with Hutchins often writing lyrics in the studio. He {{found it difficult to}} write a complete song at home, and finished the lyrics later. Hutchins worked well with Smith, and said that the producer became involved in the music-making and [...] "would start talking a lot of shit to us to let us feel like he felt". Smith's presence is evident on [...] "Friends", whose beat was (according to Hutchins) [...] "nothing like the way it sounded after he got to it". Whodini often argued with the studio personnel; Hutchins said that he [...] "never seen studio sessions like ours. Criticism would be flying around that studio like skyrockets and bullets ... But we knew we got something right when Larry started grabbing <b>his</b> <b>dick,</b> and that was the craziest thing in the world." [...] Smith encouraged Whodini to use a variety of instruments on each track, from Linn LM-1 and Roland TR-707 drum machines to a Fender Jazz Bass.|$|E

500|$|Andy Kellman of Allmusic called [...] "Carry Out" [...] the dirtiest {{track on}} the album and noted that the two artists aimed for a {{contemporary}} form of The Lonely Island's [...] "Dick in a Box" [...] (Incredibad, 2009), on which Timberlake was featured. Brian Linder of IGN commented that the production on the song is tight, but panned the single for its food-sex metaphors, calling it [...] "unforgivably stupid" [...] and [...] " [...] such a joke that we half expected Andy Samberg to show up with <b>his</b> <b>dick</b> in a happy meal box," [...] making reference to [...] "Dick in a Box", which premiered on Saturday Night Live in 2006. Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine called the collaboration and [...] "Say Something" [...] "admirable turns" [...] {{on the album}}, but commented that they are [...] "forced to operate with unenviably tepid production." [...] Cataldo concludes, writing, [...] "The overall laziness of that facet is even more inexcusable coming {{from one of the}} most renowned producers of the last decade." [...] Hugh Montgomery of The Observer noted it as one of the album's best tracks but called it [...] "merely passable" [...] and said it was [...] " [...] weighed down by [...] own leaden rapping and with nothing new to add to the familiar, futurist R formula." ...|$|E

60|$|He felt {{a slight}} touch on his arm, felt it move down, felt Mercedes slip a {{trembling}} cold little hand into <b>his.</b> <b>Dick</b> looked at her. She seemed a white-faced girl now, with staring, frightened black eyes that flashed up at him. If the loneliness, the silence, the desert, the unknown {{dangers of the}} night affected him, what must they be to this hunted, driven girl? Gale's heart swelled. He was alone with her. He had no weapon, no money, no food, no drink, no covering, nothing except his two hands. He had absolutely {{no knowledge of the}} desert, of the direction or whereabouts of the boundary line between the republics; he did not know where to find the railroad, or any road or trail, or whether or not there were towns near or far. It was a critical, desperate situation. He thought first of the girl, and groaned in spirit, prayed that it would be given him to save her. When he remembered himself it was with the stunning consciousness that he could conceive of no situation which he would have exchanged for this one--where fortune had set him a perilous task of loyalty to a friend, to a helpless girl.|$|E
