5|$|In contrast, chords {{cannot be}} shifted around the <b>fretboard</b> in {{standard}} tuning, which requires four chord-shapes {{for the major}} chords: There are separate fingerings for chords having root notes {{on one of the}} four strings three–six.|$|E
5|$|In each regulartuning, the musicalintervals are {{the same}} for each pair of {{consecutive}} strings. Other regular tunings include all-fourths, augmented-fourths, and all-fifths tunings. For each regular tuning, chord patterns may be moved around the <b>fretboard,</b> a property that simplifies beginners' learning of chords and advanced players' improvisation.|$|E
5|$|A {{player can}} access a Premium Show either through playing {{specific}} songs {{already in the}} GHTV catalog or through microtransactions. Completing Premium Shows can earn the player in-game rewards such as a decorative item for their player card or on-screen <b>fretboard.</b> The week after their introduction, these songs {{are added to the}} on-demand playlist, and after another week enter into the GHTVs rotation of songs. At the release of Guitar Hero Live, Activision announced plans to add 70 new songs to GHTV before the end of 2015.|$|E

5|$|Frith {{recorded}} the album at David Vorhaus's Kaleidophon Studios in London on 11–13 and 15 July 1974, {{where he played}} a modified 1936 Gibson K-11. He added an extra pickup over the strings at the nut, enabling him to amplify sound {{from both sides of}} the fretted note. He then split the <b>fretboard</b> in two with a capo, effectively giving him two guitars, each amplified separately that he could play independently with each hand. To split the sounds further he attached alligator clips at various positions on the strings. The net result was a guitar with multiple sound sources that could be channelled to a mixer and distributed across the stereo soundscape.|$|E
25|$|Regular tunings have {{symmetrical}} scales {{all along}} the <b>fretboard.</b> This makes it simpler to translate chords into new keys. For the regular tunings, chords may be moved diagonally around the <b>fretboard.</b>|$|E

5000|$|... "Double-Neck Dulcimers": Somewhat {{the same}} as a [...] "courting dulcimer", but with both <b>fretboards</b> (or [...] "necks") facing the same direction. Popularized by {{performer}} Bing Futch, it allows for multiple tunings without changing instruments.|$|R

25|$|Lakland Blonde Translucent Joe Osborn Signature – Has a Rosewood <b>fretboard</b> with Birdseye Maple {{blocks and}} a Black pickguard. Used between 2008 and 2015 with Rage, Wakrat and the Sound City Studios record.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, regular tunings {{have equal}} {{intervals}} between the strings, {{and so they}} have symmetrical scales all along the <b>fretboard.</b> This makes it simpler to translate chords. For the regular tunings, chords may be moved diagonally around the <b>fretboard.</b> The diagonal movement of chords is especially simple for the regular tunings that are repetitive, in which case chords can be moved vertically: Chords can be moved three strings up (or down) in major-thirds tuning and chords can be moved two strings up (or down) in augmented-fourths tuning. Regular tunings thus appeal to new guitarists and also to jazz-guitarists, whose improvisation is simplified by regular intervals.|$|E
25|$|The Santana guitars feature necks made of {{a single}} piece of {{mahogany}} topped with Rosewood <b>fretboards</b> (some feature highly sought-after Brazilian Rosewood). This helps create the smooth, singing, glass-like tone for which he is known.|$|R
5000|$|OOIOO was {{allegedly}} founded as a [...] "fake band for a magazine photo shoot" [...] and would later open for Sonic Youth in 1997 with [...] "stickers on their <b>fretboards</b> to indicate where their fingers should go".|$|R
50|$|Other {{examples}} of lutes with scalloped <b>fretboards</b> include the South Indian veena and Vietnamized guitar (called đàn ghi-ta, lục huyền cầm, or ghi-ta phím lõm).The Japanese multi-instrumentalist and experimental musical instrument builder Yuichi Onoue made a deeply scalloped electric guitar for Vietnamese microtonal playing techniques.|$|R
25|$|The neck is made {{of light}} wood, with a veneer of {{hardwood}} (usually ebony) to provide durability for the <b>fretboard</b> beneath the strings. Unlike most modern stringed instruments, the lute's <b>fretboard</b> is mounted flush with the top. The pegbox for lutes before the Baroque era was angled back from the neck at almost 90° (see image), presumably to help hold the low-tension strings firmly against the nut which, traditionally, is not glued in place but is {{held in place by}} string pressure only. The tuning pegs are simple pegs of hardwood, somewhat tapered, that are held in place by friction in holes drilled through the pegbox.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Fender {{announced}} a second Artist Signature model, {{based on his}} California Series Stratocaster. It retains all the specifications of his original guitar, has a compound radius <b>fretboard</b> and is made entirely in their Ensenada plant in Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The {{first five}} strings of NST have all-fifths tuning, and so its all-fifths chords are movable around the <b>fretboard.</b> In contrast, {{standard}} tuning has an irregular major-third interjected among its perfect fourths, which complicates {{the learning of}} chords by beginners.|$|E
50|$|Reichel {{constructed}} and built several variations of guitars and basses, {{most of them}} featuring multiple <b>fretboards</b> and unique positioning of pickups and 3rd bridges. The resulting sounds exceeded the range of conventional tuning and added unusual effects, from odd overtones to metallic noises, to his play.|$|R
50|$|This type of Quintola {{is like a}} {{mandolin}} or mandola, {{but with}} either 5 single strings or 10 strings in 4 paired courses. It is usually tuned C-G-D-A-E, combining the tuning of both the mandolin and mandola. They will sometimes have fanned <b>fretboards</b> to accommodate this tuning.|$|R
5000|$|The CB10C Thunderchief and CB28C Thunderchief were {{acoustic}} bass guitars featuring {{an oversized}} body with rosewood and ebony <b>fretboards</b> respectively.

25|$|Custom {{built for}} Iommi by BC Rich. Features include Dimarzio pick-ups, two {{built-in}} preamps, scalloped <b>fretboard</b> and Iommi's trademark cross inlays. This guitar {{can be seen}} in Tony's , for Star Licks Productions along with a left handed BC Rich mockingbird.|$|E
25|$|The {{irregularity}} has a price. Chords {{cannot be}} shifted around the <b>fretboard</b> {{in the standard}} tuning E-A-D-G-B-E, which requires four chord-shapes for the major chords. There are separate chord-forms for chords having their root note on the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth strings.|$|E
25|$|Fender Roadhouse Stratocaster – arctic {{white with}} brown shell pickguard and a {{rosewood}} <b>fretboard</b> – Parker's primary guitar, {{used in the}} studio and live from 2008 to 2011. It appears that Parker has stopped using this guitar as it has been damaged.|$|E
5000|$|Since 1998 Byrd {{has used}} his own design Byrd Guitar's Super Avianti guitar exclusively, which feature {{scalloped}} <b>fretboards</b> and DiMarzio pickups. He uses Marshall amplifiers and 8x10" [...] Marshall cabs, and for guitar effects, a Dunlop Cry Baby and DOD Electronics 250 overdrive pre-amp and FX35 Octoplus.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} viols had flat, glued-down bridges {{just like}} their plucked counterpart vihuelas. Soon after, however, viols adopted the wider and high-arched bridge that facilitated the bowing of single strings. The earliest of viols {{would also have}} had the ends of their <b>fretboards</b> flat on the deck, level with or resting upon the top or sound board. Once {{the end of their}} <b>fretboards</b> were elevated above the top of the instrument's face, the entire top could vibrate freely. Early viols did not have sound posts, either (again reflecting their plucked vihuela siblings). This reduced damping again meant that their tops could vibrate more freely, contributing to the characteristic [...] "humming" [...] sound of viols; yet the absence of a sound post also resulted in a quieter and softer voice overall.|$|R
50|$|The American Deluxe {{was later}} updated with Samarium Cobalt Noiseless (SCN) pickups by Fender in 2004. As of March 23, 2010, all American Deluxe series guitars {{came with a}} tinted maple neck with {{compound}} <b>fretboards,</b> N3 noiseless pickups and the S-1 switching system has been reconfigured with a Passing Lane switch on the humbucker-equipped models.|$|R
