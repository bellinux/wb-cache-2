50|$|The {{invertebrate}} fauna of {{the reserve}} has been surveyed in detail in 2002 and 2012, and surveyors found a rich and diverse fauna {{with an abundance of}} ancient woodland associated species. A total of 650 species have been identified and the reserve is now known to be of SSSI quality for saproxylic invertebrates (dead wood specialists). Of special interest is the rare fungus weevil Pseudeuparius sepicola, a Red Data Book species. The nationally scarce wood-cricket Nemobius sylvestris is very common in Briddlesford Copse and a population of the ash-black slug (Limax cinereoniger) was also recently discovered at the reserve - the largest terrestrial slug in the world. The rides and railway cuttings also provide a valuable habitat for a variety of woodland butterflies including silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia), white admiral (Limenitis camilla) and the <b>dark</b> <b>crimson</b> <b>underwing</b> moth (Catocala sponsa).|$|E

50|$|Tigerella is a bi-colored tomato cultivar, {{relatively}} small, 2 to 4 ounces (60-120 g), {{and early}} (59 days). Upon maturity the fruit is red with yellow stripes, {{essentially the same}} as Green Zebra, except that the fruit is red instead of green, and has a sweeter flavor. The colour occasionally varies, in New Zealand for instance, commercially produced Tigerella is <b>dark</b> <b>crimson</b> red with very dark green stripes.|$|R
60|$|The flowers {{produced}} by the self-fertilised plants of the last or fourth generation were as uniform in tint as those of a wild species, being of a pale pink or rose colour. Analogous cases with Mimulus and Ipomoea, after several generations of self-fertilisation, have been already given. The flowers of the intercrossed plants of the fourth generation were likewise nearly uniform in colour. On the other hand, the flowers of the London-crossed plants, or those raised from a cross with the fresh stock which bore <b>dark</b> <b>crimson</b> flowers, varied extremely in colour, as might have been expected, and as is the general rule with seedling carnations. It deserves notice that {{only two or three}} of the London-crossed plants produced <b>dark</b> <b>crimson</b> flowers like those of their fathers, and only a very few of a pale pink like those of their mothers. The great majority had their petals longitudinally and variously striped with the two colours,--the groundwork tint being, however, in some cases darker than that of the mother-plants.|$|R
