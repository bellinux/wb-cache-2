50|$|At {{the distal}} {{end of the}} metacarpal, the {{extensor}} tendon will expand to <b>form</b> a <b>hood,</b> which covers the back and sides {{of the head of}} the metacarpal and the proximal phalanx.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ground floor}} walls rise to {{approximately}} 15' 0" [...] {{and have an}} exposed frame 4" [...] x 2" [...] stud wall at 18" [...] centres. Above this and the verandah the upper level is clad in horizontal mini profile corrugated galvanised iron and above this the gables have rusticated boards. Three double hung windows are located in west and north elevations and there are four windows in the south elevation. Each of these have quadrant <b>form</b> <b>hoods</b> in galvanised iron. The roof and verandah are clad in corrugated galvanised iron. A narrow timber stair runs from the upper level {{across the back of}} the building.|$|R
5000|$|Green or yellowish-green {{flowers are}} on stalk of 5-20, with upper sepals closely {{contacting}} the petals to <b>form</b> a <b>hood</b> over the style. The lateral (side) sepals are curved. Petals are triangular and lance-like. The lip is yellowish and linear.|$|R

50|$|About 1300 the {{chaperon}} {{began to}} be worn by putting the hole intended for the face {{over the top of}} the head instead; perhaps in hot weather. This left the cornette tail and the cape or patte, hanging loose from the top of the head. This became fashionable, and chaperons {{began to be}} made to be worn in this style. Some authorities only use the term chaperon for this type, calling the earlier <b>forms</b> <b>hoods</b> - which was certainly their usual name in English. This is a categorisation for modern discussions only; there is no dispute over whether chaperon was the contemporary term. See the wearing Colley-Weston-ward of the mandilion for an analogous development in a type of coat.|$|R

50|$|The {{headlights}} and indicators {{were set}} into the front wings higher and more forward than on earlier Docker Daimlers, and the curve of each front wing <b>formed</b> a <b>hood</b> {{over the top of}} its headlight. A Perspex cover shielded the headlight and indicator in each wing.|$|R
25|$|The buff striped keelback is nonvenomous {{and totally}} harmless. When alarmed, it inflates its body causing the bright interscale colours to be exposed. Sometimes, the snake {{flattens}} and narrows its head to <b>form</b> a <b>hood.</b> This behaviour sometimes causes the species to be mistaken by laypersons {{for a baby}} cobra.|$|R

5000|$|Xanthomendoza fallax (hooded sunburst lichen) {{is a small}} yellow-orange to red-orange fioliose lichen {{that grows}} on bark, rarely on rock, {{all over the world}} except very dry areas. The nonfruiting body (thallus) grows in rosettes to 3 cm in diameter. The rosettes {{sometimes}} coalesce with each other. The lobes may appear divided at the tips. It is sometimes tightly appressed to the substrate (adnate), and sometimes not. The fruiting bodies (apothecia) are lecanorine, meaning that they are disc-like with a ring or rim of tissue around the disc that is made of tissue similar to the thallus. The tips of the lobes <b>form</b> <b>hood</b> shaped soralia that produce powdery greenish yellow soredia. It prefers growing on oak bark in California, but can also be found on rock and other wood. Lichen spot tests on the surface are K+ purple, C-, KC-, and P-.|$|R

50|$|Throughout {{the church}} there are wagon roofs, {{plastered}} in the nave and aisles and ornately {{painted in the}} chancel and transepts. The chancel has piscina, sedilia and aumbry, above which the continuous east window sill string <b>forms</b> a <b>hood.</b> Some of the wall panelling in the north aisle, and the boxing in the ringing chamber probably re-used woodwork from the 17th century pews.|$|R
5000|$|... 116-118 South Michigan Street 1887<1892 Old Argos Opera House / Huff Block is an Italianate, two-story, brick building, two bay in width. It {{dominates the}} 100 block of South Michigan in its height and design. The street level facade has been modernized with {{aluminum}} and glass. The upper facade remains unchanged. On {{the second floor}} are six masonry openings with half-round brick arches. The northern window has a lower sill, which would have provided access to a porch along the front over the sidewalk. The sills are smooth-faced limestone and the brick arches <b>form</b> <b>hoods</b> slightly raised {{from the face of}} the facade. The building is topped with a brick parapet of a simple corbelled design with stepped horizontal courses and vertical [...] "brackets". The center of the parapet is a brick half-round approximately 6 by 2 ft high. Access to the Opera hall on the second floor is from a stairwell at the south end (left) of the building.|$|R
50|$|The 15th-century {{tower is}} one of a superb group to be found in this area, and has a western doorway over which is a quaint stone <b>hood</b> <b>forming</b> a shallow porch.|$|R
25|$|The prepuce in {{both sexes}} is {{formed by the}} growth of a solid plate of {{ectoderm}} into the superficial part of the phallus; on coronal section this plate presents the shape of a horseshoe. By the breaking down of its more centrally situated cells the plate is split into two lamellæ. Thus, a cutaneous fold, the prepuce, is liberated and <b>forms</b> a <b>hood</b> over the glans.|$|R
50|$|Men of {{the upper}} classes often went hatless. The {{chaperon}} in the <b>form</b> of <b>hood</b> and attached shoulder-length cape was worn during this period, especially by the rural lower classes, and the fitted linen coif tied under the chin appeared very late in the century. Small round or slightly conical caps with rolled brims were worn, and straw hats were worn for outdoor work in summer.|$|R

50|$|Leptodoras {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by its long conical snout and well-developed oral <b>hood</b> <b>formed</b> by the membranous union of maxillary barbels, paired jaw barbels on the chin, and lip structures. It has fimbriate barbels.|$|R
50|$|As Washington's {{old growth}} forests were dwindling {{the need for}} new sources of lumber became readily apparent. On June 12, 1941 the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company {{designated}} the first certified tree farm, the Clemons Tree Farm in Washington state. The Puget Mill Company, now known as Pope & Talbot, Inc. soon followed suit, <b>forming</b> the <b>Hood</b> Canal Tree Farm in 1946 and having 75,000 acres in the tree farm by 1953.|$|R
50|$|Serapias parviflora {{grows to}} around 10 - 30 cm high (occasionally up to 40 cm). At {{the base of}} the stem, there are 4-7 keeled, linear leaves, and 1-3 bract-like leaves further up the stem. The 3-8 flowers (rarely up to 12) are {{arranged}} in a spike. The greyish-pink sepals and petals <b>form</b> a <b>hood</b> over the column and the lip, which is typically 14 - 19 mm long.|$|R
50|$|Suffa met band mate MC Pressure at Blackwood High School in {{the early}} 1990s and <b>formed</b> the Hilltop <b>Hoods.</b> After a demo and two releases, the band had a {{breakthrough}} album with The Calling in 2003.|$|R
5000|$|The Hooker Oak was {{featured}} Warner Brothers Studio's film The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938). Errol Flynn as Robin <b>Hood</b> <b>forms</b> his outlaw band beside the tree (called the [...] "Gallows Oak" [...] in the film).|$|R
50|$|They {{range from}} the Himalayas to south China, Southeast Asia, Australia, New Guinea, Melanesia and Hawaii, found in moist areas with deep shade. Most are small terrestrials, but a few are lithophytes with green or colored, velvetlike, intricate-veined leaves. The {{inflorescence}} on the erect central spike bears a few large pubescent and resupinate flowers with large, prominent lip. The petals <b>form</b> a <b>hood</b> together with the dorsal sepal. There are two stigma and two pollinia.|$|R
5000|$|Caladenia attenuata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an {{underground}} tuber {{and a single}} hairy leaf. The flowers are less than 10 mm in diameter and are borne on a spike up to 24 cm high. The flowers are white with a [...] sepal that curves forwards, <b>forming</b> a <b>hood</b> over the column. The mid-lobe of the labellum has a smooth edge but the surface is wrinkled. Flowering occurs in October and November.|$|R
5000|$|The school {{developed}} a resource with Sturt Police on [...] "Teenage Parties" [...] {{that has been}} adapted by Victorian private schools Scotch College and Toorak College. The Adelaide-based hip hop group, Hilltop <b>Hoods,</b> <b>formed</b> at Blackwood High School.|$|R
50|$|Dickson {{developed}} {{a formula for}} smokeless gunpowder, <b>forming</b> the Robin <b>Hood</b> Powder Company in 1900. He went on to establish the Robin Hood Arms Factory, which was later bought by Remington, in Swanton, Vermont. Dickson died in Swanton in 1903.|$|R
5000|$|The flower stem is 10-30 cm1 {{long and}} bears a single flower 23-28 mm long and 9-11 mm wide and shiny, greenish-white with darker green stripes. The [...] sepal is erect {{at its base}} but then arches forward, <b>forming</b> a <b>hood</b> over the {{labellum}} and has a threadlike tip, 7-14 mm long. The labellum is blunt, sharply kinked {{in the middle and}} is 13.5-17 mm long and about 3 mm wide. Flowering occurs from March to May.|$|R
50|$|The {{fenestration}} comprises {{pairs of}} three-light casements and fanlight which {{are separated by}} pilasters with simple vertical detailing and articulated by raised vertical and horizontal rendered concrete bands. The pilasters finish to the underside of a wide string course that projects forward to <b>form</b> a <b>hood</b> at each entrance and at {{the centre of the}} building. The parapet is decorated on its upper edge and on a string course below with a vertical lined pattern which creates a subtle crenellated silhouette.|$|R
50|$|The tiny {{flowers are}} green, {{arranged}} spiral in a spike or raceme around the erect and tall central stalk, and appear between September and January. The lowermost flowers are close the exit of the stalk from the sheating leaf. The dorsal sepal is sharp-pointed and <b>forms</b> a <b>hood</b> over the column. The lateral sepals are oblong and sometimes recurved. The dorsal sepal often keeps the oblong petals out of sight. The lip is ovate-oblong with united basal calli. The lobed lip has a rough, irregular margin.|$|R
50|$|Mambas and cobras are in {{the same}} family: the Elapidae. Like cobras, a mamba may rear and <b>form</b> a <b>hood</b> as part of its threat display, but the mamba's hood is {{narrower}} and is longer than the broader hood of some species of cobra, such as say, the spectacled cobras of parts of Asia. In their threat display mambas commonly gape; the black mamba's mouth is black within, which renders the threat more conspicuous. Typically also, a rearing mamba tends to lean well forward, instead of standing erect as a cobra does.|$|R
6000|$|After a {{long time}} he was one flight of stairs nearer it. It was making itself {{at home on the}} bottom step; resting, doubtless, before it came hopping up. Another dozen steps, and--It was beautifully dressed in one piece of yellow and brown that reached almost to its feet, with a bit left at the top to <b>form</b> a <b>hood,</b> out of which its pert face peeped impudently; oho, so they came in their Sunday clothes. He drew so near that he could hear it cooing: thought itself as good as upstairs, did it! ...|$|R
5|$|The {{black mamba}} is graceful but skittish and often unpredictable. It is agile and can move quickly, it is shy and secretive by nature and, like most snakes, it avoids threats. In the wild, a black mamba seldom tolerates humans {{approaching}} {{more closely than}} about 40 meters. When confronted {{it is likely to}} gape in a threat display, exposing its black mouth and flicking its tongue. It also is likely to <b>form</b> a <b>hood</b> by spreading its neck-flap as cobras do. The mamba's hood however, is narrower than that of a typical cobra. The threat display may be accompanied by audible hissing.|$|R
5000|$|Pterostylis sanguinea, {{commonly}} known as the red-banded greenhood or dark-banded greenhood, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to southern Australia. The plants either have a rosette of leaves in the years when not flowering or stem leaves on a flowering spike. When flowering, it has up to about twelve flowers which are dark reddish-brown, sometimes green or green and brown with the [...] sepal and petals joined, <b>forming</b> a <b>hood</b> over the column. It is a common and widespread orchid, found in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and, rarely, in Tasmania.|$|R
