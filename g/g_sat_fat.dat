There are multiple reports of MR imaging of peripheral nerves in compression and entrapment neuropathies.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} improve the fat {{suppression}} performance of in vivo 13 C-MRS operating at 3. 0 Tesla, a phantom model study was conducted {{using a combination of}} two fat suppression techniques; a set of pulses for frequency (chemical shift) selective suppression (CHESS), and spatial saturation (SAT). By optimizing the slab thickness for SAT and the irradiation bandwidth for CHESS, the signals of the – 13 CH 3 peak at 49 ppm and the – 13 CH 2 – peak at 26 ppm simulating fat components were suppressed to 5 % and 19 %, respectively. Combination of these two fat suppression pulses achieved a 53 % increase of the height ratio of the glucose C 1 O peak compared with the sum of all other peaks, indicating better sensitivity for glucose signal detection. This method will be applicable for in vivo 13 C-MRS by additional adjustment with the in vivo relaxation times of the metabolites.

Students choose an effort level, their performance is graded, and their grade correlates with their future income. Ex-ante, the policy maker chooses the optimal coarseness of the grading scale to maximize student welfare. When choosing their effort, students overweight outstanding - or salient - grades. I show that this behavior leads to excessive effort levels when grading is fully informative, and that coarse grading can be used to counterbalance incentives. Thus, salience can help explain why grading ranges from Pass/Fail scales (tenure decisions) via A-F-scales (school) to fully disclosing scores (e. <b>g.</b> <b>SAT)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Recent work in {{portfolios}} {{of problem}} solvers has shown {{their ability to}} outperform single-algorithm approaches in some tasks (e. <b>g.</b> <b>SAT</b> or Automated Planning). However, not much work has been de-voted {{to a better understanding}} of the relation-ship between the order of the component solvers and the performance of the resulting portfolio over time. We propose to sort the component solvers in a sequential portfolio, such that the resulting or-dered portfolio maximizes the probability of pro-viding the largest performance at any point in time. We empirically show that our greedy approach efficiently obtains near-optimal performance over time. Also, it generalizes much better than an op-timal approach which has been observed to suffer from overfitting. ...|$|R
40|$|In three {{tropical}} rain forest light environments in Sabah, Malaysia, we compared photosynthesis in seedlings of ten climax tree species with putatively differing shade tolerances. The objectives {{of the study were}} (a) to characterise the range of photosynthetic responses in ten species of the Dipterocarpaceae and (b) to elucidate those photosynthetic characteristics that might provide a basis for niche partitioning. Seedlings were acclimated (c. 7 months) in three light environments; understorey, partial shade and a gap (140 m 2). The light environments represented a gradation in median diurnal (0630 - 1830 hours) photon flux density (PFD) ranging from understorey (4. 7 μmol m- 2 s- 1) through partial shade (21. 2 μmol m- 2 s- 1) to gap (113. 7 μmol m- 2 s- 1). Integrated diurnal PFD were in the sequence gap > partial shade > understorey (15. 2, 4. 7, 1. 3 mol m- 2 day- 1, respectively). In gap-acclimated plants, species differed in the photosynthetic light-response variables apparent quantum yield, dark respiration rate, light compensation point, net saturated leaf assimilation rate (A(sat)), and in stomatal conductance (<b>g(s</b> <b>sat))</b> when assimilation rate (A) was saturated. A light-demanding pioneer species (Macaranga hypoleuca) and a shade-demanding understorey species (Begonia sp.) had, respectively, higher and lower A(sat) and <b>g(s</b> <b>sat)</b> than the dipterocarp species. In high-light conditions A(sat) and <b>g(s</b> <b>sat)</b> were strongly positively correlated in dipterocarp species. Differing photosynthetic characteristics of gap acclimated plants suggest that, in these dipterocarp species, different rates of carbon fixation may be an important factor contributing towards niche partitioning. Mean integrated diurnal A (A(diurnal)) in the gap, partial shade and understory were, respectively, 122. 9, 52. 7, 20. 5 mmol m- 2 day- 1. Differences occurred in A(diurnal) of dipterocarp species between light environments. When Macaranga was included, differences in A(diurnal) were evident in the gap and partial shade, and in both cases were attributed to the pioneer. For the variable A(diurnal), there was of a shift in the rank position of Macaranga among light environments, but a shift did not occur among the dipterocarp species. Results from this study are consistent with the idea that rates of carbon fixation per unit leaf area may contribute towards niche differentiation between the climax and single pioneer species, but not within the group of climax species. Other physiological and/or carbon allocation factors may be involved in any niche partitioning; dipterocarp species often have inherently different growth rates and susceptibility to herbivory. As an alternative to niche partitioning, dipterocarp species may co-exist in natural light environments as a result of habitat disequilibrium or purely stochastic processes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{adaptive}} noise mechanism {{was introduced}} in Novelty+ to automatically adapt noise settings during the search [4]. The local search algorithm <b>G</b> 2 W <b>SAT</b> deterministically exploits promising decreasing variables to reduce randomness and consequently the dependence on noise parameters. In this paper, we first integrate the adaptive noise mechanism in <b>G</b> 2 W <b>SAT</b> to obtain an algorithm adaptG 2 W SAT, whose performance suggests that the deterministic exploitation of promising decreasing variables cooperates well with this mechanism. Then, we propose an approach that uses look-ahead for promising decreasing variables to further reinforce this cooperation. We implement this approach in adaptG 2 W SAT, resulting in a new local search algorithm called adaptG 2 W SATP. Without any manual noise or other parameter tuning, adaptG 2 W SATP shows generally good performance, compared with <b>G</b> 2 W <b>SAT</b> with approximately optimal static noise settings, or is sometimes even better than <b>G</b> 2 W <b>SAT.</b> In addition, adaptG 2 W SATP is favorably compared with state-of-the-art local search algorithms such as R+adaptNovelty+ and V W. ...|$|R
