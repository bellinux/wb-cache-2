5|$|Combined {{with the}} Domesday Survey, the Pipe rolls {{contributed to the}} {{centralisation}} of financial records by the Norman kings (reigned 1066–1154) of England that was ahead of contemporary Western European monarchies; the French, for instance, {{did not have an}} <b>equivalent</b> <b>system</b> of accounting until the 1190s. The exact form of the records, kept in a roll instead of a book, was also unique to England, although why England kept some of its administrative records in this form is unclear. A set of Norman rolls, drafted differently, are extant in a few years for the reigns of Kings Henry II (reigned 1154–1189) and Richard I (reigned 1189–1199), who also ruled the Duchy of Normandy in France. It is believed that the Norman rolls were started {{about the same time as}} the English, but due to lack of survival of the earlier Norman rolls, it is unclear exactly when they did start. An Irish Exchequer produced Irish Pipe rolls, and much like the English Pipe rolls, the earliest surviving Irish Pipe roll, that of 1212, does not appear to be the first produced.|$|E

Thus, the Hill coefficient defines cooperativity as a statistical dependence of one binding site on the state of other site(s).|$|E

40|$|Two {{different}} physical {{systems are}} said to be thermodynamically equiv- alent if one of the thermodynamic potentials of the first system is pro- portional to the corresponding potential of the second system after expressing the state variables of the first system in terms of those of the second by a transformation reversible throughout the state pa- rameter domain. The thermodynamic equivalence has a transitive nature so that physical systems divide into classes of thermodynam- ically <b>equivalent</b> <b>systems</b> that have similar phase diagrams. A first class of thermodynamically <b>equivalent</b> <b>systems</b> is formed by the ideal classical and quantum Fermi gases, whatever the dimensions of the confining spaces, and the one dimensional hard rod gas. A second class is formed by the physical systems characterized by interactions that coincide by a scaling of the distance and the coupling constant. A third class is formed by the ideal Boses gases in arbitrary spatial dimensions. The thermodynamic equivalence can also be defined in a more general way. By so doing the first and the third class combine into a single class of thermodynamically <b>equivalent</b> <b>systems.</b> Comment: 20 pages; 2 figur...|$|R
