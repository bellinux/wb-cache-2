5|$|After the Romanian Communist Party seized {{political}} power, the sovietization of {{the army}} commenced, {{under the supervision of}} the new Minister of Defence, Emil Bodnăraş. Thirty per cent of the officers and noncommissioned officers (mostly experienced soldiers, and a potential source of opposition) were purged from the military. This involved copying the Soviet model of military and political organisation, and changing the military doctrine of combat and defence, also in the context of Romania's <b>integration</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> strategic system of the Soviets, at the beginning of the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty on Increased <b>Integration</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Economic and Humanitarian Fields {{signed in}} 1996 laid the first {{foundation}} for economic convergence. The treaty ensured {{the creation of}} a permanent executive organ to oversee integration of states that later would be part of the EEU. It served as the blueprint for the future common market for goods, services, capital and labour. The Single Economic Space established a single market across the territory of Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan. In 2015 with the entry into force of the EEU Agreement, the single market was expanded to include Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. The countries represent a market of some 183 million people and a combined GDP of around $4 trillion.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} current {{challenges}} to wind power grid <b>integration</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states {{in the middle of}} the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy. As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances. However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so. Another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.|$|E

40|$|Simple retroviruses induce tumors by {{integrating}} into the host genome, activating cellular oncogenes and microRNAs, or inactivating tumor suppressor genes. The identification of these genes elucidates molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis. In this study, we identified avian leukosis virus (ALV) proviral <b>integration</b> sites <b>in</b> rapid-onset B cell lymphomas arising < 12 weeks after infection of chicken embryos. By using inverse PCR, 28 unique viral integration sites were identified <b>in</b> rapid-onset tumors. <b>Integrations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter/enhancer region {{were observed in}} four different tumors, suggesting {{that this is a}} common integration site. These provirus integrations ranged from 217 to 2, 584 bp upstream of the TERT transcription initiation site and were all <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite transcriptional orientation to TERT. Southern blots of tumor samples demonstrated that these integrations are clonal and therefore occurred early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of tumorigenesis. Real-time RT-PCR showed overexpression of TERT mRNA in tumors harboring viral <b>integrations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> TERT promoter. Telomerase activity was also up-regulated in these tumors; however, telomere-length alterations were not detected. Furthermore, viral LTR sequences directly enhanced the expression of luciferase reporters containing the TERT promoter sequences.

Proviral insertions of MoMLV <b>in</b> <b>the</b> different <b>integration</b> clusters upregulate the transcriptional activity of the Gfi- 1 gene, which is located within the pal- 1 locus. The eis- 1 /pal- 1 /gfi- 1 /evi- 5 locus serves as a target for MoMLV proviral insertions in pre-B-cell lymphomas of Emu-myc transgenic mice (20 %) and in T-cell lymphomas of H- 2 K-myc (75 %) and Emu-pim- 1 (93 %) transgenic mice. Many tumors overexpress both Gfi- 1 as well as Myc and Pim gene family members, indicating that Gfi- 1 collaborates with Myc and Pim <b>in</b> lymphomagenesis. Proviral <b>integrations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previously identified insertion site bmi- 1 are, however, mutually exclusive with <b>integrations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eis- 1 /pal- 1 /gfi- 1 /evi- 5 locus.
