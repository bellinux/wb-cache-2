30|$|Rats {{were exposed}} to {{phosgene}} (COCl 2) using a directed-flow nose-only inhalation principle [33, 37, 51]. Current testing guidelines give preference to this mode of inhalation exposure [52]. Certified gas standards with specified stability in synthetic air were used in all studies. The gas was contained in 10  L cylinders @ 150  bar. The volume-to-mass conversion factor for phosgene is 1  ppm =  4.1  mg/m 3. Throughout all studies, the exposure period was 30  min. Air flow, temperature, and humidity measurements in the <b>inhalation</b> <b>chamber</b> utilized a computerized data acquisition and control system. The exposure conditions were adjusted to maintain an airflow rate of 0.75  L/min per rat, which is threefold higher than the respiratory minute ventilation of the rat. Under the given conditions, <b>inhalation</b> <b>chamber</b> state–state was attained within the first minute of exposure.

40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{reported}} {{an increased risk of}} cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality associated with increasing exposure to air pollution.

Recently, we have reported that an acute single intranasal instillation of SOA may induce inflammatory response in lung, but not in brain of adult mice. To clarify the whole body exposure effects of SOA on central nervous system functions, we first created <b>inhalation</b> <b>chambers</b> for diesel exhaust origin secondary organic aerosols (DE-SOAs) produced by oxidation of diesel exhaust particles caused by adding ozone. Male BALB/c mice were exposed to clean air (control), DE and DE-SOA in <b>inhalation</b> <b>chambers</b> for one or three months (5 h/day, 5 days/week) and were examined for memory function using a novel object recognition test and for memory function-related gene expressions in the hippocampus by real-time RT-PCR. Moreover, female mice exposed to DE-SOA for one month were mated and maternal behaviors and the related gene expressions in the hypothalamus examined. Novel object recognition ability and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor expression in the hippocampus were affected in male mice exposed to DE-SOA. Furthermore, a tendency to decrease maternal performance and significantly decreased expression levels of estrogen receptor (ER) -a, and oxytocin receptor were found in DE-SOA exposed dams compared with the control.

40|$|ABSTRACT The bioavailability, toxicity, and {{therapeutic}} efficacy {{of a drug}} {{is directly related to}} its administration route. The pulmonary route can be accessed by inhalation after fumigation, vaporization or nebulization. Thus, pharmacological and toxicological evaluation accessed by an apparatus specifically designed and validated for this type of administration is extremely important. Based on pre-existing models, an <b>inhalation</b> <b>chamber</b> was developed. This presents a central structure with five animal holders. The nebulized air passes directly and continuously through these holders and subsequently to an outlet. Evaluation of its operation was performed using clove essential oil, a nebulizer, and a flow meter. The air within the chamber was collected by static headspace and analyzed by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector. For this purpose, a 2. 5 minutes chromatographic method was developed. The air flow in each of the five outputs was 0. 92 liters per minute. During the first minute, the chamber became saturated with the nebulized material. Homogeneous and continuous operation of the chamber was observed without accumulation of volatile material inside it for 25 minutes.

These responses have repeatedly been documented in rodents following hyperoxic exposure in <b>inhalation</b> <b>chambers</b> [9 – 15]. Although hyperoxia has been suggested to induce time-dependent inflammatory responses [10], studies in animals are usually restricted to periods of up to 6  h of mechanical ventilation, limiting its clinical applicability [16 – 19].

Given that oxygen therapy cannot altogether be avoided, we aimed to increase knowledge on the host response to different levels of oxygen. Hypothesizing that hyperoxia induces a dose-dependent gradual inflammatory response that may be aggravated by prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation, our purpose was to induce hyperoxia in mice and study both time- and dose-dependent inflammation effects of supplemental oxygen during prolonged ventilatory support with protective and injurious tidal volumes.|$|R

Methods: We used chemical vapor deposition (CVD) without the addition of any additives to generate nano-CBPs with a particle size (electrical mobility diameter) of less than 100 nm {{to examine the effects}} of inhalation exposure. Nano-CBPs were applied to a nose-only <b>inhalation</b> <b>chamber</b> system for studying the inhalation toxicity in rats. The effect on the lungs and circulatory system was determined according to the degree of inflammation as quantified by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The functional alteration of the hemostatic and vasomotor activities was measured by plasma coagulation, platelet activity, contraction and relaxation of blood vessels. Results: Nano-CBPs were generated in the range of 83. 3 - 87. 9 nm. Rats were exposed for 4 hour/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks to 4. 2 × 106, 6. 2 × 105, and 1. 3 × 105 particles/cm 3. Exposure of nano-CBPs by inhalation resulted in minimal pulmonary inflammation and did not appear to damage the lung tissue.
