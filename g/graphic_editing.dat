50|$|Appraisal fraud: Occurs when a home's {{appraised}} value is deliberately overstated or understated. When overstated, more {{money can be}} obtained by the borrower {{in the form of a}} cash-out refinance, by the seller in a purchase transaction, or by the organizers of a for-profit mortgage fraud scheme. Appraisal fraud also includes cases where the home's value is deliberately understated to get a lower price on a foreclosed home, or in a fraudulent attempt to induce a lender to decrease the amount owed on the mortgage in a loan modification. A dishonest appraiser may be involved in the preparation of the fraudulent appraisal, or an existing and accurate appraisal may be altered by someone with knowledge of <b>graphic</b> <b>editing</b> tools such as Adobe Photoshop.

40|$|Simulation {{practitioners}} in construction often experience difficulties in developing simulation models, i. e., tediousness and error-proneness. The visual environment {{presented in this}} paper gives users user-friendly support throughout the entire simulation development process, with the provision of a visual modelling interface, easy-to-use icon animation, and dynamic statistics. Under the visual modelling interface, modelling construction operations is completed through editing activity-based graphics as the standard <b>graphic</b> <b>editing</b> tools do, and no programming is required. An easy-to-use animation can facilitate communication between the simulation model and users, and assist users in verification and validation of the simulation model. Instead of creating 3 -D images with adequate skills and much time, this animation takes the graphic simulation model as the background images and the pre-created 2 -D iconic images as moving objects, in order that the preparing for animation is simple. ...|$|E
