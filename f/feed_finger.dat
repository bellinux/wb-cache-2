25|$|Southern Death Cult {{reformed}} as the Cult, a {{more conventional}} hard rock group. In their wake, the Mission, which included two {{former members of the}} Sisters of Mercy, achieved commercial success in the mid-1980s, as did Fields of the Nephilim and All About Eve. Other bands who continue to be associated with gothic rock include Alien Sex Fiend, All Living Fear, And Also the Trees, Balaam and the Angel, Claytown Troupe, Dream Disciples, <b>Feeding</b> <b>Fingers,</b> Inkubus Sukkubus, Libitina, Nosferatu, Rosetta Stone, and Suspiria. The 1990s saw a resurgence of the goth subculture, fueled largely by crossover from the industrial, electronic and metal scenes; and goth culture and aesthetic again worked itself into the mainstream consciousness, inspiring thriving goth music scenes in most cities and notoriety throughout popular culture.|$|R

Some babies {{can take a}} preference to bottle feeding if it is introduced before breastfeeding is established. 2. <b>Finger</b> <b>feeding</b> is one alternative offered to a mother to feed her baby when giving breast milk or formula milk to a baby that a mother wishes to breastfeed. 3. A ravenous baby can make attachment more difficult. The <b>finger</b> <b>feeding</b> technique {{can be used to}} calm a fractious baby before offering the breast 1, 2 4.

5000|$|AllMusic {{reviewer}} Andrew Hamlin criticised {{the band}} for [...] "high 'pricing' {{of their new}} project" [...] and called the above-mentioned [...] "challenge" [...] imperious. He has admitted that [...] "this odd poise of seeming to snap on <b>feeding</b> <b>fingers</b> carries over to the record on several levels". Philip Wilding of Classic Rock magazine rated the album four stars out of five and described it as [...] "a collection full of grace and tenacity, thoughtful and thought provoking and not without moments of real clarity and beauty". Hogarth was complimented for his vocals which had [...] "rarely sounded better". In the opinion of Catherine Chambers from Kerrang! magazine, it was shocking that Anoraknophobia, conjuring up [...] "a pretty contemporary feel with its classy mix of blues, country, and even trip-hop stylings" [...] proved to be [...] "actually pretty damn good" [...] after Marillion had delivered many poorly received recordings. Stuart Maconie was more critical of the album in his review for Q magazine, awarding it just two stars out of five. He wrote: [...] "Steve Hogarth is way funkier than Fish but the tone is still as arch and self-important as a lower-sixth poetry mag". He praised [...] "Between You and Me", comparing it favourably with Crowded House and U2, but criticised the band for musical self-indulgence, especially on the 11-minute [...] "This is the 21st Century". Maconie concluded: [...] "Clearly Marillion can play. If only they wouldn't play so much of it".|$|R
25|$|Involuntary {{movements}} {{may make}} feeding difficult or messy and may excessively prolong mealtimes. It {{may be easier}} to <b>finger</b> <b>feed</b> than use utensils (e.g., spoon or fork). For liquids, it is often easier to drink from a closed container with a straw than from an open cup. Caregivers may need to provide foods or liquids so that self-feeding is possible, or they may need to feed the person with A-T. In general, meals should be completed within approximately 30 minutes. Longer meals may be stressful, interfere with other daily activities, and limit the intake of necessary liquids and nutrients.|$|R
40|$|Loss of hand {{function}} is a core feature of Rett syndrome. This article describes longitudinal hand function at 3 time points for 72 subjects {{participating in the}} Australian Rett Syndrome Database. Approximately 40 % of subjects with some grasping abilities lost skill over the 3 - to 4 -year period between video assessments. In these subjects, a decrease in hand function was seen less frequently in girls 13 to 19 years old than in those younger than 8 years, in subjects with some mobility compared with those who were wheelchair bound, and in those who had previously been able to <b>finger</b> <b>feed.</b> Relationships with the magnitude of change reflected these findings. Change in hand function did not vary with clinical severity. The results for all subjects were similar to results obtained when analysis was restricted to those with a pathogenic mutation. Variability in the longitudinal course of hand function in Rett syndrome was observed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, {{the role of}} <b>finger</b> millet <b>feeding</b> on skin {{antioxidant}} status, nerve growth factor (NGF) production and wound healing parameters in healing impaired early diabetic rats is reported. Hyperglycemic rats received food containing 50 g/ 100 g finger millet (FM). Non-diabetic controls and diabetic controls received balanced nutritive diet. Full-thickness excision skin wounds were made after 2 weeks prior <b>feeding</b> of <b>finger</b> millet diet. The rate of wound contraction, and the levels of collagen, hexosamine and uronic acid in the granulation tissue were determined. The skin antioxidant status and lipid peroxide concentration were also monitored during the study. In hyperglycemic rats fed with finger millet diet, the healing process was hastened with an increased rate of wound contraction. Skin levels of glutathione (GSH), ascorbic acid and  α-tocopherol in alloxan-induced diabetic rat were lower as compared to non-diabetics. Altered activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were also recorded in diabetics. Interestingly, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were elevated in the wound tissues of all the groups, when compared to normal (unwounded) skin tissues. However, in diabetic rats the TBARS levels of both normal and wounded skin tissues were significantly elevated (P< 0. 001) when compared with control (non-diabetic) and diabetics fed with FM. Impaired production of NGF, determined by ELISA, in diabetic rats was improved upon FM feeding and further confirmed by immunocytochemical observations reflects the increased expression of NGF in hyperglycemic rats supplemented with FM-enriched diet. Histological and electron microscopical evaluations revealed the epithelialization, increased synthesis of collagen, activation of fibroblasts and mast cells in FM-fed animals. Thus, increased levels of oxidative stress markers accompanied by decreased levels of antioxidants {{play a vital role}} in delaying wound healing in diabetic rats. However, FM feeding to the diabetic animals, for 4 weeks, controlled the glucose levels and improved the antioxidant status, which hastened the dermal wound healing process...|$|R
40|$|To provide {{staff with}} the {{information}} to assist a woman with flat or inverted nipples to breastfeed successfully. POSTNATAL MANAGEMENT OF NIPPLE VARIATION: 1. Keep mother and baby skin-to-skin {{for as long as}} is medically possible after birth. Teach the mother to watch her baby for early feeding cues, e. g., mouthing, hand to mouth, rapid eye movement. 2. If baby is unable to attach effectively, record on variance sheet ‘MR 261. 10 Flat or Inverted Nipples’. 3. Express the colostrum and feed the baby by cup or <b>finger</b> <b>feeding.</b> Regular expression 8 - 10 times (using hands, an electric pump or a combination of both) in 24 hours will be necessary to establish lactation. See Clinical Guidelines, Section B, 8. 3. 1). Ensure only a gentle even pressure is exerted on the breast tissue by the shield of the electric pump and ensure the correct size shield is used. Reassure the mother that with the onset of lactogenesis II she will start to obtain expressed milk. 4. Continue to offer breast regularly before expressing. 5. If the baby cannot attach to the breast and no colostrum can be expressed continue to offer skinto-skin contact. Use the double pump with Symphony and the correct sized shield. Note: Formula feeds may need to be medically ordered until lactation is established if no milk can be expressed. NIPPLE SHIELD USE � Once lactogenesis Stage II has occurred, a nipple shield may be effective in enabling breast attachment 1 - 3 � The Lactation Consultant or an experienced midwife should review feeding prior to using/introducing nipple shield. ...|$|R
