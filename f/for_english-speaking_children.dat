40|$|AIMS: The aim of {{this study}} was to obtain {{normative}} nasalance values for typically developing Ugandan <b>English-speaking</b> <b>children</b> as a reference point for clinical practice and further research. METHODS: Sixty-nine typically developing Ugandan children (35 males and 34 females, 2. 7 - 13. 5 years of age) participated in the study. Nasalance scores were obtained with the Nasometer while children repeated 4 sustained sounds, 14 repeated syllables, 15 sentences (12 oral, 3 nasal) and 2 texts ('Rainbow Passage' and 'Zoo Passage'). Data were analyzed for gender and age dependence. RESULTS: No significant effects of age or gender on nasalance values were obtained; hence, normative values for the overall group were reported. The average nasalance scores <b>for</b> Ugandan <b>English-speaking</b> <b>children</b> were 17 and 64 % for the oral and nasal sentences and 33 and 14 % for the oronasal and oral text, respectively.

40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this study}} was to better {{understand}} how and when onset /l/ (leap) and coda /l/ (peel) are acquired by children by examining both the articulations involved and adults' perceptions of the produced segments. Method: Twenty-five typically developing Australian <b>English–speaking</b> <b>children</b> aged 3; 0 (years;months) to 7; 11 participated in an elicited imitation task, during which audio, video, and lingual ultrasound images were collected. Transcribers perceptually rated audio, whereas video and ultrasound images were visually examined for the presence of adult-like articulations. Results: Data from this study establish that for Australian English–learning children, coda /l/s are acquired later than onset /l/s, and older children produce greater proportions of adultlike /l/s in both onset and coda positions, roughly following established norms <b>for</b> American <b>English–speaking</b> <b>children.</b> However, although perceptibility of coda /l/s was correlated with their articulations, onset /l/s were nearly uniformly perceived as adultlike despite substantial variation in the articulations used to produce them. Conclusions: The disparity in the production and perception of children's singleton onset /l/s is linked to both physiological and phonological development. Suggestions are made for future research to tease these factors apart. 15 page(s...|$|R

50|$|In 1965, a {{group of}} parents, {{concerned}} that their children were growing up as English monolinguals in a predominantly French-speaking Quebec, wanted to implement French immersion programs in their community of St. Lambert, Quebec. These parents sought help from bilingualism experts such as Lambert and Richard Tucker to implement these programs. To address the concerns of these parents, Lambert and Tucker designed an experiment in which there were two groups of English-speaking children. One group attended increasing numbers of classes (subjects) taught in French, with the remaining classes taught in English, while the other group received instruction solely in the traditional English. Lambert and Tucker’s objective {{was to determine whether}} learning French would be beneficial <b>for</b> <b>English-speaking</b> <b>children</b> in Quebec’s social and political context. They also sought to evaluate the consequences of learning a second language on academic performance in general. After the fourth year of instruction in their respective groups, the children were compared in terms of their attitudes toward the Francophone community, as well as their academic scores. Results showed that the French immersion group performed as well as the English control group in all academic subjects, while mastering a second language. In a follow-up evaluation, the researchers found that those who had acquired French as a second language had more favourable attitudes toward the French community compared to those in the control groups. The implications of this study led to the successful implementation of many language immersion programs in Canada and around the world.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the respective contribution of verbal working memory, which was operationalized as immediate digit and sentence recall, to bilingual children’s reading fluency and comprehension in the first language (L 1) and second language (L 2).

40|$|ABSTRACT—Children’s {{acquisition}} of fundamental biologi-cal concepts (LIVING THING, ANIMAL, PLANT) {{is shaped by}} the way these concepts are named. In English, but not Indo-nesian, the name ‘‘animal’ ’ is polysemous: One sense in-cludes all animate objects, and the other excludes humans. Because names highlight object categories, if the same name (‘‘animal’’) points to two different, hierarchically related biological concepts, children should have difficulty settling on the scope of that term and its close neighbors (e. g., ‘‘alive’’). Experiments with 4 - to 9 -year-old English- and Indonesian-speaking children revealed that ‘‘alive’ ’ poses unique interpretive challenges, especially <b>for</b> <b>English-speaking</b> <b>children.</b> When asked to identify entities that are ‘‘alive,’ ’ older Indonesian-speaking children selected both plants and animals, but their English-speaking counter...|$|E

The onset and subsequent growth of nouns, predicates, function words and social terms proved to be quite similar in both languages. No support was found for the prediction that verbs would emerge earlier in Italian, although Italians did produce {{a higher proportion of}} social terms, and there were small but intriguing differences {{in the shape of the}} growth curve for grammatical function words. A strikingly similar nonlinear relationship between grammatical complexity and vocabulary size was observed in both languages, and examination of the order in which function words are acquired also yielded more similarities than differences.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{language}} use and literacy practices of 36 children (aged three-and-a-half, seven and 11) from a Gujerati and Urdu-speaking Muslim community in north-east London. These experiences are explored in the children’s three-generation families, {{in the community}} and in school through interviews, recordings and observations.

The findings suggest that children who have access to the culture and leisure facilities of a community centre maintain a higher level of linguistic vitality in Gujerati and are more creative story tellers in both Gujerati and English than children who do not have these opportunities. Support for Gujerati in the home is oral rather than literacy-based and does not have a significant directimpact on children’s achievement in literacy. Support for literacy in English is related to books, and does have a positive impact. Overall, by age 11, children are performing above the norms <b>for</b> monolingual <b>English-speaking</b> <b>children</b> of a similar background, are fluent speakers of a dialect of Gujerati and are becoming literate in Urdu for religious purposes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} nonstandard {{approach}} to standard English {{as a second}} dialect (SESD). It rejects assimilationist ideology {{as a way of}} legitimizing the educational experience of language minority groups, advocating instead a pluralist position which views the acquisition of standard English by native speakers of other varieties as "additive bidialectalism" rather than remediation. The paper begins by clarifying "dialect," "creole" and "standard" as necessary background to a discussion of the ideology of linguistic prescriptivism. Research in two areas is then reviewed: (a) studies examining dialectal differences and their influence on cross-dialectal communication, and (b) sociolinguistic research on classroom participation structures involving language minority students.

30|$|As {{asserted}} by Ambridge and Kidd (2015), Hale (2001), and Levy (2008), {{there is}} a correlation between {{the frequency with which}} specific patterns occur in the input and the ease of production, comprehension, and acquisition of relative clauses. As for the relative clauses, we would hypothesize that the frequency of occurrence is relevant to the difficulty of relative clauses. According to Diesel (Diessel 2009. p. 258) the frequency of subject and direct object RC’s is far more than any other type of the relative clause in maternal speech. This is in line with our finding that subject RC’s benefit from an advantage over their indirect object counterparts. But it does not justify the finding that oblique RC’s are not more difficult than direct object RC’s for EFL learners to comprehend. Kim, and O’Grady, W. (2015) assert that the Frequency Hypothesis may not offer a general explanation for the performance of children in the production of relative clauses. They note that a full account of RC’s needs to explain not only why specific relative clauses are easier than others, but also why learners resort to the particular avoidance strategies while producing different types of relative clauses. One such approach involves passivization. In their study, <b>for</b> instance, <b>English-speaking</b> <b>children</b> passivized the verbs to create a subject RC.|$|R
