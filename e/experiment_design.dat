2500|$|At {{the end of}} the century, {{the members}} of the French Academy of Sciences had {{attained}} clear dominance in the field. At the same time, the experimental tradition established by Galileo and his followers persisted. [...] The Royal Society and the French Academy of Sciences were major centers for the performance and reporting of experimental work. Experiments in mechanics, optics, magnetism, static electricity, chemistry, and physiology were not clearly distinguished from each other during the 18th century, but significant differences in explanatory schemes and, thus, <b>experiment</b> <b>design</b> were emerging. [...] Chemical experimenters, for instance, defied attempts to enforce a scheme of abstract Newtonian forces onto chemical affiliations, and instead focused on the isolation and classification of chemical substances and reactions.|$|E

40|$|The Anthropometric Measurements Laboratory has {{accumulated}} {{a large body}} of data from a number of previous experiments.

The accumulated data defines two groups or classes. Some of the data was collected from an <b>experiment</b> <b>designed</b> to measure the flexibility of the limbs, referred to as radial movement. The remaining data was collected from <b>experiments</b> <b>designed</b> to determine the surface of the reach envelope. An interactive signal processing package was designed and implemented.
