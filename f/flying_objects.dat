5|$|Shen Kuo wrote {{several other}} books besides the Dream Pool Essays, yet {{much of the}} writing in his other books has not survived. Some of Shen's poetry was {{preserved}} in posthumous written works. Although much of his focus was on technical and scientific issues, he {{had an interest in}} divination and the supernatural, the latter including his vivid description of unidentified <b>flying</b> <b>objects</b> from eyewitness testimony. He also wrote commentary on ancient Daoist and Confucian texts.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics, who {{adhere to}} the psychosocial {{hypothesis}} for unidentified <b>flying</b> <b>objects,</b> argue that the convergence of New World Order conspiracy theory and UFO conspiracy theory {{is a product of}} not only the era's widespread mistrust of governments and the popularity of the extraterrestrial hypothesis for UFOs but of the far right and ufologists actually joining forces. Barkun notes that the only positive side to this development is that, if conspirators plotting to rule the world are believed to be aliens, traditional human scapegoats (Freemasons, Illuminati, Jews, etc.) are downgraded or exonerated.|$|E
5|$|The first aerial {{photographs}} {{were taken in}} 1858 by the balloonist Nadar; in 1860 James Wallace Black took the oldest surviving aerial photographs, also from a balloon. As photographic techniques made further progress, {{at the end of}} the 19thcentury some pioneers placed cameras in unmanned <b>flying</b> <b>objects.</b> In the 1880s, Arthur Batut experimented with kite aerial photography. Many others followed him, and high-quality photographs of Boston taken with this method by William Abner Eddy in 1896 became famous. Amedee Denisse equipped a rocket with a camera and a parachute in 1888, and Alfred Nobel also used rocket photography in 1897.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Change the {{aerodynamic}} {{characteristics of}} the <b>flying</b> <b>object</b> by controlling the canard deflection and achieve ballistic correction of the <b>flying</b> <b>object.</b> Select different angles of attack to simulate and analyze the changes on aerodynamic performance of the <b>flying</b> <b>object</b> at different flight speed. Study the variation regularity and influence factors of aerodynamic characteristics with the deflection angle and {{the area of the}} canard as characteristic parameters...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose the}} <b>flying</b> <b>object</b> that adapts {{itself to the}} {{environment}} {{by means of the}} dynamic behavior change mechanism. The <b>flying</b> <b>object</b> is user-defined, first-class and abstract entity. Such properties provide independency and transparency. The <b>flying</b> <b>object</b> model establishes a unique decomposition of the <b>flying</b> <b>object.</b> In this model, the <b>flying</b> <b>object</b> consists of four objects: the delegator that encapsulates the implementation, the message handler that interprets the messages, the event handler that provides adaptation strategies and the context object that holds a state beyond the adaptation. The ability of accommodation, the openness, is one of great contributions of this model because many functions such as object migration, load balancing, distributed transaction management, the communication protocols and even adaptation strategies can be introduced by the message handler and the event handler as a plug-in module. Furthermore, a source code translation technique is introduced for automatic decomposition of the <b>flying</b> <b>object</b> as a replacement for the virtual machine customizations or low-level programming. The delegator and the context object are instantiated from the same translated class to minimize maintenance costs of classes {{as a result of an}} automatic translation. Therefore, the system organized by the <b>flying</b> <b>object</b> is best suited for the open distributed environment...|$|R

The result of its work, formally titled Scientific Study of Unidentified <b>Flying</b> <b>Objects,</b> and known as the Condon Report, appeared in 1968.|$|E

25|$|Mulder {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in the first season pilot episode, broadcast in 1993. Mulder believes in extraterrestrial unidentified <b>flying</b> <b>objects</b> (UFOs) and a government conspiracy to hide or deny the truth of their existence.

25|$|A {{significant}} {{fraction of}} the population believes {{that at least some}} UFOs (Unidentified <b>Flying</b> <b>Objects)</b> are spacecraft piloted by aliens. While most of these are unrecognized or mistaken interpretations of mundane phenomena, there are those that remain puzzling even after investigation. The consensus scientific view is that although they may be unexplained, they do not {{rise to the level of}} convincing evidence.|$|E

He also presented other material during the 1970s such as metal samples, sound recordings and film footage. Meier reports regular contacts with extraterrestrials he calls the Plejaren.|$|E
25|$|A {{record of}} a saucer-shaped object is from 1290 of a silver disc flying over a village in Yorkshire. Disc-like <b>flying</b> <b>objects</b> were {{occasionally}} reported throughout the millennium. For example, in a mass sighting over Nuremberg in 1561, discs and spheres were reported emerging from large cylinders (see woodcut at left). They are also claimed by ufologists to frequently show up in religious artwork.|$|E
25|$|Project Blue Book {{was one of}} {{a series}} of {{systematic}} studies of unidentified <b>flying</b> <b>objects</b> (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force. It started in 1952, and it was the third study of its kind (the first two were projects Sign (1947) and Grudge (1949)). A termination order was given for the study in December 1969, and all activity under its auspices ceased in January 1970.|$|E

25|$|UFO {{conspiracy}} theories argue that various governments, and politicians globally, {{most notably the}} officials of Washington DC, are suppressing evidence of extraterrestrial unidentified <b>flying</b> <b>objects</b> and alien visitors. Such {{conspiracy theories}} commonly argue that Earth governments, especially the Government of the United States, are in communication and/or cooperation with extraterrestrials despite public claims to the contrary, and further {{that some of these}} theories claim that the governments are explicitly allowing alien abduction.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} of extraterrestrial life is not, by itself, a paranormal subject. Many scientists are {{actively engaged in}} the search for unicellular life within the solar system, carrying out studies on the surface of Mars and examining meteors that have fallen to Earth. Projects such as SETI are conducting an astronomical search for radio activity that would show evidence of intelligent life outside the solar system. Scientific theories of how life developed on Earth allow for the possibility that life developed on other planets as well. The paranormal aspect of extraterrestrial life centers largely around the belief in unidentified <b>flying</b> <b>objects</b> and the phenomena said to be associated with them.|$|E
25|$|The Kenneth Arnold UFO {{sighting}} {{occurred on}} June 24, 1947, when private pilot Kenneth Arnold {{claimed that he}} saw a string of nine, shiny unidentified <b>flying</b> <b>objects</b> flying past Mount Rainier at speeds that Arnold estimated at a minimum of 1,200 miles an hour (1,932km/hr). This was the first post-War sighting in the United States that garnered nationwide news coverage and is credited with being {{the first of the}} modern era of UFO sightings, including numerous reported sightings over the next two to three weeks. Arnold's description of the objects also led to the press quickly coining the terms flying saucer and flying disc as popular descriptive terms for UFOs.|$|E
