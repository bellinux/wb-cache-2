Another passenger from the flight was placed <b>in</b> <b>handcuffs</b> after a dog alerted officers to his carry-on luggage; he was searched, and released without charges. For several days following, federal officials denied that this second handcuffing had occurred, they later reversed this position, confirming that a second passenger had been handcuffed.|$|E

Metal is practically immune to struggling and escape. In BDSM erotica, metal chains are often associated with historical torture and prison scenarios.|$|E

25|$|Another of Houdini's {{most famous}} {{publicity}} stunts was {{to escape from}} a nailed and roped packing crate after it had been lowered into water. He first performed the escape in New York's East River on July 7, 1912. Police forbade him from {{using one of the}} piers, so he hired a tugboat and invited press on board. Houdini was locked <b>in</b> <b>handcuffs</b> and leg-irons, then nailed into the crate which was roped and weighed down with two hundred pounds of lead. The crate was then lowered into the water. He escaped in 57 seconds. The crate was pulled to the surface and found still to be intact, with the manacles inside.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} years of the next decade, two {{prominent}} foreign citizens were perp-walked by American law enforcement agencies. Viktor Bout, a Russian long wanted by the U.S. and other governments for arms smuggling, was arrested in Thailand and taken past waiting media by federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents upon his extradition in 2010. The next year, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then director of the International Monetary Fund and considered a leading candidate to challenge Nicolas Sarkozy in the 2012 French presidential election, was arrested and charged with the attempted rape of a hotel housekeeper. French journalists covering the incident in New York were stunned into silence when a handcuffed Strauss-Kahn was brought by them. In France, where it is illegal to publish pictures of an identifiable person <b>in</b> <b>handcuffs</b> or police custody unless they have been convicted, the images sparked considerable public outrage.|$|E

500|$|At {{the request}} of the local sheriff and United Airlines, the Federal Bureau of Investigation sent {{fingerprint}} experts to help identify the human remains. The Los Angeles Times reported that among the dead were 13 civilian and military managers, engineers and technicians assigned to the American ballistic missile program. [...] Articles in the Las Vegas Review-Journal commemorating the 40th and 50th anniversaries of the crash reported that the FBI search went beyond fingerprint matching for identification; the agents were also looking for any surviving sensitive papers relating to national security that the group of military contractors had carried on board <b>in</b> <b>handcuffed</b> briefcases. The same reports also said the crash prompted the military and defense industry to adopt rules to keep groups of technical people involved in the same critical project from traveling together on the same plane.|$|R

On more than one occasion, they both performed straitjacket escapes while dangling upside-down {{from the roof of}} a building in the same city.|$|R
