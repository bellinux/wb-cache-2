50|$|Prior to General Motors {{bankruptcy}} filing, U.S. {{state law}} governed the minimum required distance between same-franchise dealers; {{known as the}} eight-mile rule. The eight-mile rule prohibits same-franchise dealers from locating within eight miles of each other. In 2001 General Motors formally declared Project 2000 would be implemented {{as part of a}} brand-channeling strategy designed to consolidate its network of privately owned individual franchise dealerships and reduce the number of locations from 7,300 to 3,800. Project 2000 served as the primary mechanism for combining single-point Buick-Pontiac-GMC dealer locations together forming a single corporate brand division (BPG). Project 2000 also targeted single-point Cadillac-Hummer-Saab dealer locations and allowed single-point Chevrolet and Saturn dealer locations to stand on their own. Project 2000 calculated the fair market value for each individually owned dealer franchise to be $3,000 per vehicle based on total volume from any one of the previous three years. Upon agreement of a fair market value, dealers with interest in selling their franchise rights were free to negotiate with each other, and ultimately execute a buy-sell agreement which contained mutually agreed upon terms and conditions required to legally sell and transfer franchise property and ownership rights. Section 363 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code expedited General Motors Project 2000 efforts to reduce its dealer network and circumvent state and federal criminal laws prohibiting the illegal sale of property, or transfer of ownership by an unauthorized party. Thousands of family-owned, profitable, well-capitalized dealerships were forced to forfeit their franchise rights to a neighboring dealer-competitor selected by General Motors. Compensation has not yet been awarded in cases where <b>individual</b> <b>dealer</b> franchise property and ownership rights were transferred for the purpose of granting such rights to a nearby dealer selected by General Motors. In addition to reports of fraud and theft filed with the police, GM dealers joined to form the Committee to Restore Dealer Rights. The committee to restore dealer rights is responsible for helping draft HR 2743, which asserts the action taken by General Motors to consolidate its dealer network by transferring <b>individual</b> <b>dealer</b> franchise ownership and property without compensation was illegal. , HR 2743 remains in committee.|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of a service parts supply chain is especially challenging in environments characterized by low-demand rates, expensive parts and high service requirements. As a result, {{an increasing number}} of manufacturers have begun pursuing a strategy that promotes inventory sharing among the dealers in their distribution network. Hence, {{there is a need for}} decision models that enable the analysis of the dealer inventory sharing problem, particularly in decentralized dealer networks, i. e., networks in which the dealers are independent of the manufacturer. In this paper we develop a framework for modeling and analyzing inventory sharing problems in decentralized dealer networks. We first analyze an <b>individual</b> <b>dealer</b> problem under inventory sharing in a make-to-stock setting. We use dynamic programming to characterize the structure of the optimal policy for an <b>individual</b> <b>dealer.</b> A queueing approach is then used to characterize the performance measures for this optimal inventory replenishment and sharing policy. We then consider a decentralized, multi-dealer setting to study the impact of inventory sharing among independent dealers.

40|$|Secret sharing is a {{mechanism}} by which a trusted dealer holding a secret “splits ” the secret into many “shares ” and distributes the shares to a collection of parties. Associated with the sharing is a monotone access structure, that specifies which parties are “qualified ” and which are not: any qualified subset of parties can (efficiently) reconstruct the secret, but no unqualified subset can learn anything about the secret. In the most general form of secret sharing, the access structure can be any monotone NP language. In this work, we consider two very natural extensions of secret sharing. In the first, which we call distributed secret sharing, there is no trusted dealer at all, and instead {{the role of the}} dealer is distributed amongst the parties themselves. Distributed secret sharing {{can be thought of as}} combining the features of multiparty non-interactive key exchange and standard secret sharing, and may be useful in settings where the secret is so sensitive that no one <b>individual</b> <b>dealer</b> can be trusted with the secret.

40|$|In this dissertation, we {{consider}} an inventory sharing and rationing problem in continuous-review, infinite-horizon, distribution networks. Unlike previous literature on inventory sharing, we model inventory sharing as a multiple demand classes problem {{in which each}} dealer faces two classes of demand: his own customers and inventory sharing requests from other dealers. We first focus on a decentralized system in which each <b>individual</b> <b>dealer</b> is independent of the manufacturer and thus makes his own inventory decisions {{in order to minimize}} his own cost. We analyze inventory sharing in two different settings: a make-to-stock decentralized system with exponential replenishment lead time; and a decentralized system with constant replenishment lead time. For these two models, we use different approaches to obtain dealers 2 ̆ 7 performance measures and cost functions, and then use a game theoretic approach to characterize the equilibrium behavior of the individual dealers. Comprehensive computational studies are conducted for both models, highlighting the impact of the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s incentives and the cost of sharing on dealers 2 ̆ 7 sharing behavior in a decentralized system. We believe that these two models are the first attempt to simultaneously consider inventory sharing, inventory rationing, and decentralized decision making. To complete our analysis, we also consider an inventory sharing and rationing problem in a centralized network. We focus our analysis on a make-to-stock inventory sharing system, which enables us to consider capacity issues in inventory transshipment, which has not been studied in previous work. Compared to previous literature, {{we consider}} transshipment in a much broader sense. Transshipment can be used for transferring inventory for emergency demand filling and balancing inventory allocation between different locations, as well as achieving production capacity flexibility. For the centralized inventory sharing system, we prove the structure of the optimal policy, analyze structural properties of the optimal policy parameters, and provide conditions that simplify the optimal policy. We also conduct a numerical sensitivity analysis of the optimal solution to different cost parameters. We conclude with a discussion of a heuristic developed from our understanding of the true optimal policy. ...|$|E
40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsJeffery R. WilliamsFor {{the past}} couple years, farm income has {{declined}} due to lower prices for corn, soybeans, and wheat. This decline has caused agricultural producers to keep equipment longer, which has affected equipment sales at John Deere. When times are good, producers buy new and trade used equipment, but when a producer’s profit is lower than previous years, they tend to save their money for input costs for the next growing season. The decline in farm income has had {{a negative effect on}} agriculture sales, but dealers can maintain their market share goals and still be profitable if they adjust their focus to other areas of their business, including sales of parts and equipment service. The goal {{of this study is to}} create an analysis tool that field managers can use to help dealers see the potential sales, profit, and pay for performance that they are missing because they are not up to suggested guidelines for sales of parts and equipment service. The tool includes several metrics from an existing report called the Categorization Report. These metrics are Dealer Performance Market Share, Aftermarket Performance Factor, Service Market Performance Factor, and Net Operating Return on Sales. The tool calculates the differences between the dealer metrics and John Deere metrics. Further, this tool is used to compare an <b>individual</b> <b>dealer</b> to other dealer averages and determine what a high performance, fully optimized dealer looks like and how much more a dealership could be selling in sales, parts and service to be a sustainable business in today’s economy. The tool is used to examine three scenarios to demonstrate its flexibility. These scenarios include a top-ten dealer, a large-scale above-average dealer, and a merger of three dealerships. The spreadsheet tool will display a two-page summary that shows how a dealership compares with other dealers that are similar in size and how they compare to the top-ten elite dealers in their category. The summary will also include market share maps to show which dealer-specific geographical areas need improvement to earn more sales in the future...|$|E

No responsibility for them should be attributed to the Bank of Canada. iii Dealers in foreign exchange (FX) markets provide intraday liquidity to market participants by standing ready to buy and sell currencies at their posted bid and o¤er quotes. They are also key participants in the provision of overnight, or interday, liquidity. To hold an unde-sired position, dealers demand compensation in terms of higher exchange rate returns either directly or indirectly via the private information learned from order ow. As intermediaries in the decentralized FX market, they are able to learn about the order ow of various market participants which can be informative about future movements in the exchange rate. Dealers in nancial institutions trade in multiple price-correlated markets, and look for opportuni-ties to speculate, or reduce any undesired risky positions, across markets. I illustrate an interdependent relationship between the overnight positions of non- 8 ̆ 5 nancial customers and dealers across markets. While dealers provide liquidity to foreign 8 ̆ 5 nancial customers, they are resistant to providing liquidity when central banks intervene.
