5|$|In {{the court}} of Vizhnitz, it was known that if the Rebbe asked for a {{cigarette}} to smoke {{in the middle of}} reading a kvitel, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> that the petitioner's request had been accepted. Rabbi Eliezer Dovid Friedman, a follower of the fourth Vizhnitzer Rebbe, Rabbi Chaim Meir Hager, witnessed this in 1965 when he delivered a kvitel to the Rebbe on behalf of a Melbourne Jew stricken with cancer and the Rebbe asked for a cigarette while reading the kvitel. The man recovered completely. However, in 1972, immediately after the death of the Rebbe, the Melbourne Jew fell ill with the same disease and succumbed to it.|$|E
5|$|Outside Europe, {{women were}} able to dress as men and go undetected. Deborah Sampson fought in the American Revolution as a man named Robert Shurtlieff, and pursued {{relationships}} with women. Edward De Lacy Evans was born female in Ireland, but took a male name during the voyage to Australia and lived as a man for 23 years in Victoria, marrying three times. Percy Redwood created a scandal in New Zealand in 1909 when he {{was found to be}} Amy Bock, who had married a woman from Port Molyneaux; newspapers argued whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of insanity or an inherent character flaw.|$|E

25|$|Trimble's {{election}} as Leader {{came in the}} aftermath of his role in the Drumcree conflict, in which he led a controversial 1995 Orange Order Protestant march, amidst Nationalist protest, down the predominantly Roman Catholic Nationalist Garvaghy Road in Portadown, County Armagh. Trimble and Democratic Unionist Party Leader Ian Paisley walked hand-in-hand as the march, banned since 1997, proceeded down the road. Many Irish Catholics viewed it as insensitive, while many Protestants felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> that Trimble was defending them.|$|E
25|$|Timur {{himself had}} divided his territories among Pir Muhammad, Miran Shah, Khalil Sultan and Shah Rukh, which {{resulted}} in inter-family warfare. Upon Babur's death, Humayun's territories were the least secure. He had ruled only four years, and not all umarah (nobles) viewed Humayun as the rightful ruler. Indeed, earlier, when Babur had become ill, some of the nobles had tried to install his uncle, Mahdi Khwaja, as ruler. Although this attempt failed, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of problems to come.|$|E
25|$|St. Martin’s {{popularity}} was renewed {{during the}} First World War. Anticlericalism declined, and priests {{served in the}} French forces as chaplains. More than 5,000 of them died in the war. In 1916, Assumptionists organized a national pilgrimage to Tours that attracted people from all of France. The devotion to St. Martin was amplified in the dioceses of France, where special prayers were offered to the patron saint. When the armistice was signed on Saint Martin’s Day, 11 November 1918, the French people saw <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of his intercession {{in the affairs of}} France.|$|E

25|$|The Cardinals opened 2011 {{with a loss}} at {{home against}} the San Diego Padres on March 31, after leading 3–2 with two outs in the 9th inning. Matt Holliday hit {{what looked to be}} the game-winning home run {{in the bottom of the}} 8th, but closer Ryan Franklin gave up a game-tying home run in that 9th inning, sending the game to extra innings. The Padres scored twice in the 11th to win 5–3. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of things to come for Franklin in 2011.|$|E
25|$|The Ashanti {{government}} was built upon a sophisticated bureaucracy in Kumasi, with separate ministries {{to handle the}} state's affairs. Of particular note was Ashanti's Foreign Office based in Kumasi; despite its small size, it allowed the state to pursue complex negotiations with foreign powers. The Office was divided into departments to handle relations separately with the British, French, Dutch, and Arabs. Scholars of Ashanti history, such as Larry Yarak and Ivor Wilkes, disagree over {{the power of this}} sophisticated bureaucracy in comparison to the Asantahene, but agree that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of a highly developed government with a complex system of checks and balances.|$|E
25|$|In late 1995, Ó Sé {{returned}} to the limelight when he was appointed manager of the Kerry senior football team. The task ahead was enormous as Kerry had fallen down the pecking order in terms of championship aspirations. The county hadn't won an All-Ireland title since Ó Sé was a player almost a decade earlier in 1986. Kerry's last Munster title came in 1991; however, since then near rivals Cork had dominated the provincial series. In Ó Sé's first Munster campaign in 1996 Kerry reached the final. Cork, a team looking for an eighth title in ten years, provided the opposition, however, Ó Sé's touch worked the oracle as the Kingdom won by 0-14 to 0-11. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> that Kerry {{were on the way}} back; however, a defeat by Mayo in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final highlighted the fact that the team was lacking in some quarters.|$|E

25|$|With a 25-run lead, England {{knew they}} would need to open up a decent margin over New Zealand in their second innings to take the match away from the tourists. Despite the loss of both captain Alastair Cook and Nick Compton in the first 10 overs, England started well, as Jonathan Trott and Joe Root built a third-wicket {{partnership}} of 123, the only century partnership in the match. However, the loss of Root for 71 with the last ball of the 50th over {{was the beginning of the}} end. Trott achieved his half-century in the following over, but Bairstow's wicket fell soon after, followed by Matt Prior, who picked up a pair off Tim Southee. Trott was out himself two overs before the close of play, and England finished on 180/6. On the fourth morning, Southee went on to tear through the English lower order, which included an out-of-sorts Ian Bell, who had spent most of the previous day recovering from flu-like symptoms. England were eventually all out for 213 in just 68.3 overs, despite having been 159/2 in the 50th. Only Stuart Broad showed any resistance, scoring an unbeaten 26, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of things to come.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his 227 receiving yards, Carter had a 30-yard carry and returned two punts for 21 yards. Vikings lineman Chris Doleman had two sacks. Wilson completed 20/34 passes for 298 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception. Nelson finished the day a perfect 5/5 on field goals, a notable contrast to his lowly 13/24 performance during the regular season. Montana was held to just 12/26 completions for 109 yards with one interception. Young had a solid performance with 12/17 completions for 158 yards and a touchdown, with one interception, while also leading San Francisco in rushing with 72 yards on six carries. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of what lay in store for 49ers fans, as they would watch him and Montana compete fiercely for the starting quarterback job until Young inherited the starting position when Joe Montana suffered a serious elbow injury during the 1991 preseason. Until the 2007–08 NFL playoffs with the Cowboys losing to the Giants, {{this was the last}} time the No. 1 seed in the NFC did not advance to the NFC Championship Game. Oddly, after the Cowboys loss, three of the next four No. 1 seeds in the NFC would lose their first playoff game (2008 Giants, 2010 Falcons and 2011 Packers).|$|E

AEG president Tim Leiweke stated he hoped that the film would give fans some peace of mind that as a company, Jackson's 'legacy' and well being was always a priority and the fact that people had thought otherwise had really [...] "hurt" [...] people at AEG.

500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} {{four days after the}} riot, journalist André Laurendeau was the first to suggest that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of growing nationalism in Quebec. Laurendeau suggested the riot [...] "betrayed what lay behind the apparent indifference and long-held passiveness of French Canadians". In contrast, in his book The Rocket: A Cultural History of Maurice Richard, Benoît Melançon disputes the importance of the riot, stating its perceived importance in history grew retroactively with Richard's myth. Melançon wrote: [...] "According to this popular narrative, {{for the first time the}} people of Quebec stood up for themselves; especially English Canada delights in anachronistically announcing that this was the beginning of the 1960s Quiet Revolution." ...|$|E
500|$|The next Second Circuit vacancy {{arose in}} 1921, {{but with the}} {{conservative}} Warren G. Harding administration in power, Hand did not put himself forward. [...] Nonetheless Hand's reputation was such that by 1923, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. wanted him on the Supreme Court, and in 1924 Harding's successor, Calvin Coolidge, appointed Hand to the Second Circuit. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of Hand's increased stature that figures such as Coolidge and Chief Justice William Howard Taft now endorsed him. Coolidge sought to add new blood to a senior judiciary that was seen as corrupt and inefficient. In 1926 and 1927, the Second Circuit was strengthened by the appointments of Thomas Walter Swan and Hand's cousin Augustus Noble Hand.|$|E
500|$|Marshall's {{performance}} {{received a}} positive response from Passions cast members, while her exit {{was the subject of}} criticism. Ross felt that Marshall had the most demanding role on the soap opera, and commended her ability to make [...] "Liz want to have sex {{in the middle of the}} tsunami" [...] look believable. During the filming of the show, Ross said she used to watch Marshall and take notes on how to improve her own acting. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Ross criticized the decision to remove Marshall, and said, [...] "When you're an actress of her caliber and kind to everyone and plan Christmas parties and celebrate everyone's birthday and know your lines and are the most darling girl that ever breathed, of course you're going to be fired!" [...] Rodney Van Johnson, who portrayed T. C.

500|$|On 13 May, a {{committee}} of Buddhist monks formalized their request to Diệm for the five demands. Although the signatories had couched the declaration as [...] "requests", they had expectations that these would be met. On 15 May, a delegation of six monks and two laymen met Diệm to present the document. After the meeting, the monks {{held a press conference}} at the Xá Lợi Pagoda. It was to be the first of many in which they attempted to publicise their cause to the foreign press corps. Diệm agreed to meet with a Buddhist delegation, but increased tension further by demeaning them. Initially, Diệm refused to pay compensation, believing <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of weakness. He claimed there was no discrimination in South Vietnam and that all religions had been treated equally with respect to the flag issue. In regard to the classification of Buddhism as an [...] "association" [...] under Decree 10, Diệm claimed it was an [...] "administrative oversight" [...] that would be fixed (although no action was taken on the matter during his final six months of office); Diệm labeled the Buddhists [...] "damn fools" [...] for demanding something that according to him, they already enjoyed. The government press release detailing the meeting also used the expression [...] "damn fools".|$|E
500|$|A further {{reason for}} the absence of Baroque decoration, and the most common, is that most rooms were never {{intended}} for such decoration. Many of the palazzi were vast, meant for huge numbers of people. The household of the Sicilian aristocrat, beginning with himself, his wife and many children, would typically also contain a collection of poorer relatives and other extended family members, all of whom had minor apartments in the house. Moreover, there were paid employees, often including a private chaplain or confessor, a major domo, governesses, secretary, archivist, accountant, librarian, and innumerable lower servants, such as a porter to ring a bell a prescribed number of times according to the rank of an approaching guest. Often the servants' extended families, especially if elderly, also lived in the palazzo. Thus many rooms were needed to house the household. These everyday living quarters, even for the [...] "Maestro and Maestra di Casa", were often simply decorated and furnished. Further rooms were required by the Sicilian tradition that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of poor breeding to permit even mere acquaintances to stay in local inns. Any visiting foreigner, especially an Englishman, was regarded as a special trophy and added social prestige. Hence the Sicilian aristocrat's home was seldom empty or quiet.|$|E
500|$|Baroque {{eventually}} {{went out}} of fashion. In some parts of Europe, it metamorphosed into the rococo, but not in Sicily. No longer ruled by Austria, Sicily, from 1735 officially the Kingdom of Sicily, was ruled by the King of Naples, Ferdinand IV. Hence Palermo was in constant association with the principal capital Naples, where there was architecturally a growing reversion to the more classical styles of architecture. Coupled with this, {{many of the more}} cultured Sicilian nobility developed a fashionable obsession with all things French, from philosophy to arts, fashion, and architecture. Many of them visited Paris in pursuit of these interests and returned with the latest architectural engravings and theoretical treatises. The French architect Léon Dufourny was in Sicily between 1787 and 1794 to study and analyse the ancient Greek temples on the island. Thus Sicilians rediscovered their ancient past, which with its classical idioms was now the height of fashion. The change in tastes did not come about overnight. Baroque remained popular on the island, but now Sicilian balconies, extravagant as ever, would be placed next to severe classical columns. Dufourny began designing in Palermo, and his [...] "Entrance Temple" [...] (1789) to the Botanical Gardens was the first building in Sicily in a style based on the Greek Doric order. It is pure neoclassical architecture, as established in England since 1760, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of things to come.|$|E
50|$|If {{high levels}} of {{nitrogen}} appear in the fluid, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of fertilizer burn.

40|$|Despite {{indications}} that {{economic growth is}} picking up, the coalition government {{shows no sign of}} moving away from its austerity programme.
