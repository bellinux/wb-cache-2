5|$|Dairying is only {{economic}} in Wales with {{a sufficiently}} large herd in a productive lowland area. Hand-milking a few cows in a byre <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> {{of the past}} and nowadays herds are milked by machine in modern parlours, {{two or three times a}} day. The milk passes by pipeline to the cooler and is stored in a refrigerated bulk tank and collected by milk tanker daily. In general, the cows graze outdoors in summer and spend their winter under cover, often in cubicles, the bulk of their feed being silage. Milk prices barely cover the costs of production, margins are tight, and there are fewer family-run dairy farms each year. In 2014, there were 1855 milk-producers in Wales, an annual decline of 1.23% since 2011, but the number of cows milked was nearly static at 223,000.|$|E

The related adjective, car-carrying, is also endocentric: it refers to an object, which is a carrying-thing (or equivalent, which does carry).|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} British Hindus and Sikhs still {{adhere to the}} caste system and still seek {{marriage}} with individuals who are of similar caste categories. There have been several incidents involving abuse of low caste British Hindus, known as Dalits, by higher caste individuals in schools and workplaces. However, other Hindus say that caste discrimination <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> {{of the past in}} Britain, and that the Asian community has moved on.|$|E
25|$|Descartes {{explains}} how {{he made a}} mention of the two questions, the existence of God, and the soul, in his Discourse on Method. Following this, he received objections, {{and two of them}} he considers are of importance. The first is how he concludes that the essence of the soul <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> that thinks, excluding all other nature. To this he says that he has a clear perception that he is a thinking thing, and has no other clear perception, and from this he concludes that there is nothing else in the essence of the self.|$|E

25|$|People with aphasia may {{experience}} {{any of the}} following behaviors due to an acquired brain injury, although some of these symptoms may be due to related or concomitant problems such as dysarthria or apraxia and not primarily due to aphasia. Aphasia symptoms can vary based on the location of damage in the brain. Signs and symptoms {{may or may not be}} present in individuals with aphasia and may vary in severity and level of disruption to communication. Often those with aphasia will try to hide their inability to name objects by using words like thing. So when asked to name a pencil they may say it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> used to write.|$|E

500|$|Brownlee was the campaign's {{dominant}} figure, {{and gave}} 67 speeches around the province.

[...] Having signed the resource agreement, {{he asked for a}} mandate to administer its implementation. [...] In response to claims that a strong opposition was needed to exercise a check on his certain-to-be-re-elected government, he restated his view of government as [...] "the administration of business" [...] by saying [...] "an opposition <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> that is no more needed in the public business of this Province...than in the management of the affairs of any of our large corporations."

His shots off the back foot down the ground off fast bowlers—you can't really describe how good they were." [...] His captain for Australia and New South Wales, Richie Benaud said that he was [...] "one of the greatest entertainers we've had in Australian cricket". O'Neill's style led the British writer EW Swanton to say [...] "the art of batting, he reminded us, was not dead, merely inexplicably dormant" [...] Wisden opined that [...] "A high innings by O'Neill <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> of masterful beauty.

500|$|A Rutgers University study, {{published}} in 2011, {{was the first}} to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain, and supports the possibility of a distinct G-spot. When the research team asked several women to stimulate themselves in a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) machine, brain scans showed stimulating the clitoris, vagina and cervix lit up distinct areas of the women's sensory cortex, which means the brain registered distinct feelings between stimulating the clitoris, the cervix and the vaginal wall – where the G-spot is reported to be. [...] "I think that the bulk of the evidence shows that the G-spot is not a particular thing," [...] stated Barry Komisaruk, head of the research findings.

500|$|Commentators {{have noted}} a resurgent {{interest}} from citizens in renewing their BNO passports {{as they are}} feeling insecure in having a Hong Kong passport. Legal experts have become increasingly concerned at the reach of Chinese law enforcement. Jerome A. Cohen, expert in Chinese law at New York University, said China's increasing assertiveness in the world represents [...] "not only the extending reach of Chinese law, but the extending reach of Chinese lawlessness." [...] Willy Lam, professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, warned: [...] "Not just the publishing and media circles, but the entire Hong Kong society, including people who do business in [...] China, and who might have commercial disputes with Chinese companies or {{different parts of the}} Chinese government, might fear for their safety because of such a very dangerous precedent". [...] "Freedom from fear <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> of the past for Hong Kong and this applies to everyone: businessmen or student," [...] said a spokesman for the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor.|$|E
500|$|For example, the {{following}} quote {{was presented to}} both groups of subjects: [...] "Only the willfully blind can fail {{to see that the}} old style capitalism of a primitive freebooting period is gone forever. The capitalism of complete laissez-faire, which thrived on low wages and maximum profits for minimum turnover, which rejected collective bargaining and fought against justified public regulation of the competitive process, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> of the past." [...] When participants thought that Bridges (a well-known union leader) was the author, they interpreted the passage to be an [...] "expression of the accomplishments of labor in the face of opposition from capital and contained a resolve to defend these gains from attack". However, when Johnston (president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the time) was the author, they interpreted the passage to be [...] "a perspective of policy in the interest of business, especially of 'enlightened' business". Asch conducted a very similar and classic study with participants reading statements either attributed to Jefferson or Lenin.|$|E
500|$|Media {{response}} to Intimacy was generally favourable; aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised rating of 69% based on 27critical reviews. Steven Robertshaw of Alternative Press described the album as arguably Bloc Party's finest career moment {{and noted that}} it offers [...] "sweat and circuitry, savagery and submission, and a captivating energy that's severely lacking in many music scenes on the planet". Kyle Anderson of Rolling Stone claimed that by [...] "replacing Bloc Party's distant cool with vivid honesty, Okereke makes Intimacy a confident new peak for his band", while PopMatters' Ross Langager explained that the record [...] "might not actually be all that intimate, but it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> of rough, recycled beauty". Adam Mazmanian of The Washington Times commented that the album's final mix showed that producers Epworth and Lee preserved the essence of Bloc Party's signature sound—"minor key rock thrumming with rhythmic intensity"—while taking the band in new musical directions. Dave Simpson of The Guardian concluded that it would please old and new fans alike by being [...] "brave, individual and heartfelt".|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Anything Goes" [...] / [...] "Anything You Can Do" [...] mash-up {{was widely}} acclaimed. Respers France named Pearce's {{performance}} the best {{moment of the}} episode, {{and found that the}} character positively reminded her of [...] "Glee of old". The song was also a favorite of Lee's, who wrote that the intensity of the actress was perfectly matched to the character's disposition. West, Slezak and Benigno gave the performance an [...] "A"; the former called it an [...] "outstanding rendition" [...] which [...] "felt like it belonged on a big stage or in a big-screen musical", and the latter two praised her vocal talent, which Benigno deemed unequalled on Glee. Futterman and Bell found Harmony a credible rival to Rachel vocally, and eagerly anticipated future competition between them. Urban called Pearce's performance merely [...] "serviceable". Though she felt her acting was a weak point, she compared her favorably to season two guest star Charice and praised her vocals. Criticism came from New York Lindy West, who did not understand Rachel's humiliation, as New Directions [...] "sing way more elaborate and equally competent arrangements four to five times an episode". She elaborated, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> that drives me crazy about Glee. As a viewer, there's no knowing whether a performance was 'good' like 'Anything Goes,' or 'bad' like 'We've Got the Beat,' until Rachel starts crying or some cheerleader starts throwing spaghetti." ...|$|E
500|$|Patrick Kolan of IGN Australia awarded it {{a perfect}} 10/10 and said, [...] "It's the Watchmen film you {{always wanted to}} see, but never {{expected}} to get." [...] Also praising the film along with another perfect score (4/4) was Kyle Smith of the New York Post, comparing it to some of Stanley Kubrick's films: [...] "Director Zack Snyder's cerebral, scintillating follow-up to 300 seems, to even a weary filmgoer's eye, as fresh and magnificent in sound and vision as [...]" [...] Roger Ebert gave it four out of four stars and wrote, [...] "It's a compelling visceral film—sound, images and characters combined into a decidedly odd visual experience that evokes {{the feel of a}} graphic novel." [...] Richard Corliss of Time concluded [...] "this ambitious picture <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> of bits and pieces," [...] yet [...] "the bits are glorious, the pieces magnificent." [...] Total Film awarded it 4/5 stars, stating: [...] "It's hard to imagine anyone watching the Watchmen as faithfully as Zack Snyder's heartfelt, stylised adap. Uncompromising, uncommercial, and unique." [...] When comparing the film to the original source material, Ian Nathan of Empire felt that while [...] "it isn't the graphic novel... Zack Snyder clearly gives a toss, creating a smart, stylish, decent adaptation." [...] Nick Dent of Time Out Sydney gave the film 4/6 in his review of February 25, praising the film's inventiveness but concluding, [...] "While Watchmen is still as rich, daring, and intelligent an action film as there's ever been, it also proves Moore absolutely right [...] As a comic book, Watchmen is an extraordinary thing. As a movie, it's just another movie, awash with sound and fury." ...|$|E
500|$|Inside Zimbabwe, the {{reaction}} was hostile to the players. Zimbabwe's Minister of Information, Jonathan Moyo, called Olonga an [...] "Uncle Tom" [...] who had [...] "a black skin and a white mask". Zanu PF information secretary Nathan Shamuyarira claimed they were forced into it by the British media, and [...] "No true Zimbabwean would have joined in," [...] but [...] "Olonga is not a Zimbabwean, he is a Zambian". Olonga was charged with treason, an offence punishable by death. MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai released a statement {{in support of the}} protest. He was charged with treason, although the charge was later dropped. Givemore Makoni, the President of Takashinga Cricket Club where Olonga played said [...] "It is disgraceful what Henry Olonga and Andy Flower have done. Taking politics on to the playing field <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> the International Cricket Council and all sports organisations have been trying to avoid," [...] and that [...] "by taking politics on to the field and bringing the game into disrepute Henry appears to have breached Takashinga's code of conduct". Olonga was immediately suspended and later sacked by Takashinga Cricket Club. Stephen Mandongo, the President of the Zimbabwe Cricket Union also condemned the protest, saying [...] "What Flower and Olonga did is very wrong. They have jeopardised our reputation when given this once in a lifetime chance to host the World Cup ... It would be wrong if they wore black armbands again." [...] They referred the matter to the International Cricket Council, who deemed that they had taken a political action, but refused to charge them with a formal offence. Instead, they released a statement reiterating the apolitical nature of the organisation, and asked the players not to wear black armbands {{for the rest of the}} tournament, with the threat of more serious punishment if they continued to wear them.|$|E
