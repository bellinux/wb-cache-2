40|$|Intrusion {{detection}} systems (IDS) {{are among}} the most common countermeasures against network attacks. In order to improve the alerts obtained from them, various methods of post-processing have been proposed. These methods usually try to alleviate specific drawbacks of intrusion detection. We propose a system that is a post-processing solution. The input of our system is a set of <b>multiple</b> IDS sensors <b>alert</b> sets. Each set's alerts are aggregated in order to improve their quality, before <b>multiple</b> <b>alert</b> sets merge into one general alert set. Then, a low clustering procedure allows the system to hypothesize about missed security events and to create relevant alerts. The main clustering phase comes next, before the final step, in which a clusters graph is generated to produce a high level presentation of the security events. The system has been tested using the DARPA 2000 dataset, as well as a live network dataset, and has produced satisfactory results. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{fast and}} {{efficient}} delivery of alerts to citizens {{in case of}} natural or manmade disasters is a crucial element in the crisis reaction chain. Current procedures and practices are however inhomogeneous and rely partially on outdated technologies. The increasing availability of new information channels suggests that the exploitation of available communications technologies can provide a consistent improvement in the alerting process. These considerations have led the ETSI Working Group SES/SatEC (Satellite Earth Stations and Systems/Satellite Emergency Communications) to initiate a standardization activity in order to define a multi-technology alert encapsulation protocol called MAMES (<b>Multiple</b> <b>Alert</b> Message Encapsulation over Satellite). This paper reports on the motivations and the approach followed within SES/SatEC {{in the definition of}} MAMES...|$|R

50|$|The {{three layer}} {{architecture}} for intelligent vehicles, namely Perception-Decision-Action, is an application integration concept. The Perception layer fuses together {{the information from}} the vehicle sensors in order to bring better and more reliable perception of the environment. It then passes this information to a decision layer which centralises and keeps track of all potential threats around the vehicle. Finally, the Action layer receives a decision information and judges by itself how and when to trigger an information, warning or intervention for the driver. This simplified concept helps the design of intelligent vehicles by using one single reliable and precise source of perception of the environment including the vehicle itself and avoid <b>multiple</b> <b>alerts</b> or conflicting messages displayed to the driver.|$|R

40|$|New {{features}} of the PAYL anomalous payload detection sensor are demonstrated to accurately detect and generate signatures for zero-day worms. Experimental evidence demonstrates that site-specific packet content models are capable of detecting new worms with high accuracy in a collaborative security system. A new approach is proposed that correlates ingress/egress payload alerts to identify the worm's initial propagation. The method also enables automatic signature generation that can be deployed immediately to network firewalls and content filters to proactively protect other hosts. We also propose a collaborative privacy-preserving security strategy whereby different hosts can exchange PAYL signatures to increase accuracy and mitigate against false positives. The important principle demonstrated is that correlating <b>multiple</b> <b>alerts</b> identifies true positives from the set of anomaly alerts and reduces incorrect decisions producing accurate mitigation...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} compliance with The Joint Commission’s Congestive Heart Failure Core Measures, a rule based {{clinical decision support system}} (CDSS) was developed and deployed at a community hospital in our health system. We evaluated the performance of the CDSS in identifying patients with primary congestive heart failure (CHF) and identified problems encountered with its introduction. Performance of the CDSS was compared against a manual review of records of patients with diagnosis of primary CHF. The CDSS had a sensitivity of 0. 79 and PPV of 0. 11. The CDSS issued <b>multiple</b> <b>alerts</b> for majority of the patients (74 %). The number of alerts issued for patients without primary CHF was large, and for a majority of patients (63 %) physicians did not respond to alerts the first time. The CDSS performed poorly and was eventually withdrawn but provided insight into a subsequently successful method for managing CHF. 1...|$|R
