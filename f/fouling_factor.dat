The authors have developed and implemented methodologies for quantitatively evaluating the various sources of SG performance degradation, {{both internal and external}} to the SG pressure boundary. These methodologies include computation of the global <b>fouling</b> <b>factor</b> history, evaluation of secondary deposit thermal resistance using deposit characterization data, and consideration of pressure loss causes unrelated to the tube bundle, such as hot-leg temperature streaming and SG moisture separator fouling. In order to evaluate the utility of the global <b>fouling</b> <b>factor</b> methodology, the authors performed case studies for a number of PWR SG designs. Key results from two of these studies are presented here. In tandem with the fouling-factor analyses, a study evaluated for each plant the potential causes of pressure loss. The combined results of the global <b>fouling</b> <b>factor</b> calculations and the pressure-loss evaluations demonstrated two key points: (1) that the available thermal margin against fouling, which can vary substantially from plant to plant, has an important bearing on whether a given plant exhibits losses in electrical generating capacity, and (2) that a wide variety of causes can result in SG thermal performance degradation...|$|E

The layer of deposits represents additional resistance to heat transfer and causes the rate of heat transfer in a heat exchanger to decrease.

40|$|The {{majority}} of large-scale desalination {{plants in the}} Arab Gulf area employ the multistage flash (MSF) processes. MSF processes are energy intensive and it is, therefore, essential to search for design and operating conditions which lead to reduction of energy dissipation and consequently lower water production cost. This paper reports a simulation study which was carried out to examine {{to what extent the}} thermal irreversibility of an MSF process is influenced by variation of the most important design and operating parameters. The impact of variation of top brine temperature, number of stages and terminal temperature approach on the distiller performance ratio and irreversibility were explored and presented graphically in the term of thermal grids. The simulation study revealed that within the selected range of number of stages (16 - 40) and top brine temperature (90 120 oC), the MSF distiller irreversibility is highly influenced by the number of stages {{and to a lesser extent}} by the variation of the top brine temperature. The simulated results are compared with one year operating data obtained from an MSF distiller. The distiller is a cross-tube configuration, which consists of 22 stages and operating at a top brine temperature ranging between 90 to 98 oC. Using a steady state simulation program, an envelop of possible operating conditions is constructed for the distiller to interrelate performance ratio, production, recycle flow and top brine temperature.

Scaling data were collected at constant heat flux from eight experimental runs. Five different constant heat fluxes were used ranging from 45000 to 93000 Btu/hr. ft², in increments of approximately 12000 Btu/hr-ft². Scaling behavior was quantified by combining measured temperature and heat flux data to obtain corresponding local fouling factors.

Plotting the fouling factors versus time showed that a typical plot was composed of three fouling periods. During an initial delay period the <b>fouling</b> <b>factor</b> remained constant, or increased relatively slowly.

40|$|The {{utilization}} of osmosis for engineered applications sparked off various emerging technologies relying on osmotically driven membrane processes (ODMPs). Represented by forward osmosis (FO) and pressure retarded osmosis (PRO), ODMPs show great promise to leverage the global water-energy nexus and have drawn considerable attention in recent years. However, their performance in practical applications is significantly affected by membrane fouling. Membrane fouling {{is a complex}} problem and {{is associated with the}} foulant deposition, concentration polarization and reverse solute diffusion (RSD) in ODMPs. The current paper provides a comprehensive review on membrane fouling in ODMPs with a focus on the elaboration of the factors and mechanisms governing the fouling behavior. Among those <b>fouling</b> <b>factors</b> and mechanisms, some are also applicable for pressure-driven membrane processes (e. g., reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF)), such as the effects of hydrodynamic conditions, feedwater composition, and membrane material and properties, and the cake-enhanced concentration polarization (CE-CP) mechanism. Others are unique for ODMPs, such as the effects of draw solution composition and membrane orientation, the internal concentration polarization (ICP) self-compensation effect, and the RSD-enhanced fouling. A general osmotic-resistance filtration model for ODMPs is presented in this paper to assist in the interpretation of the intrinsic interrelationships among those <b>fouling</b> <b>factors</b> and mechanisms.

40|$|Among many {{seawater}} desalination processes, the multistage flash (MSF) desalination {{process is}} {{a major source of}} fresh water around the world. The most costly design and operation problem in seawater desalination is due to scale formation and corrosion problems. <b>Fouling</b> <b>factor</b> {{is one of the many}} important parameters that affect the operation of MSF processes. This thesis therefore focuses on determining the optimal design and operation strategy of MSF desalinations processes under fouling which will meet variable demand of freshwater. First, a steady state model of MSF is developed based on the basic laws of mass balance, energy balance, and heat transfer equations with supporting correlations for physical properties. gPROMS software is used to develop the model which is validated against the results reported in the literature. The model is then used in further investigations. Based on actual plant data, a simple dynamic <b>fouling</b> <b>factor</b> profile is developed which allows calculation of <b>fouling</b> <b>factor</b> at different time (season of the year). The role of changing brine heater <b>fouling</b> <b>factor</b> with varying seawater temperatures (during the year) on the plant performance and the monthly operating costs for fixed water demand and fixed top brine temperature are then studied. The total monthly operation cost of the process are minimised while the operating parameters such as make up, brine recycle flow rate and steam temperature are optimised. It was found that the seasonal variation in seawater temperature and brine heater <b>fouling</b> <b>factor</b> results in significant variations in the operating parameters and operating costs. The design and operation of the MSF process are optimized in order to meet variable demands of freshwater with changing seawater temperature throughout the day and throughout the year. On the basis of actual data, the neural network (NN) technique has been used to develop a correlation for calculating dynamic freshwater demand/consumption profiles at different times of the day and season. Also, a simple polynomial based dynamic seawater temperature correlation is developed based on actual data. An intermediate storage tank between the plant and the client is considered. The MSF process model developed earlier is coupled with the dynamic model for the storage tank and is incorporated into the optimization framework within gPROMS. Four main seasons are considered in a year and for each season, with variable freshwater demand and seawater temperature, the operating parameters are optimized at discrete time intervals, while minimizing the total daily costs. The intermediate storage tank adds flexible scheduling and maintenance opportunity of individual flash stages and makes it possible to meet variable freshwater demand with varying seawater temperatures without interrupting or fully shutting down the plant at any-time during the day and for any season. Finally, the purity of freshwater coming from MSF desalination plants is very important when the water is used for industrial services such as feed of boiler to produce steam. In this work, for fixed water demand and top brine temperature, the effect of separation efficiency of demister with seasonal variation of seawater temperatures on the final purity of freshwater for both cleaned and fouled demister conditions is studied. It was found that the purity of freshwater is affected by the total number of stages. Also to maintain the purity of freshwater product, comparatively large number of flash stage is required for fouled demister...|$|E

These heat exchangers often suffer from severe fouling issues because as {{the water in the}} cooling tower evaporates, the mineral concentration in the remaining water increases. Once the solubility limits are reached, the minerals precipitate and deposit on the heat transfer surfaces: an undesirable yet unavoidable phenomenon. Due to the fouling deposit on the heat transfer surfaces, the thermal resistance between refrigerant and water gradually increases. The fouling resistance depends on several factors such as heat exchanger geometry, heat flux, water quality and water flow rates. The <b>fouling</b> <b>factors</b> penalize the overall effectiveness of the refrigerant condensers and thus must be properly accounted for during the equipment design. Predictions of the fouling allowances during the life service of the condenser characterize the degradation in thermal performance and provide guidelines about the maintenance and service of this type of equipment. In this work, a smooth TTHE was investigated by using a new experimental facility at Oklahoma State University. The aim was to measure the fouling resistance in real time and correlate the data with the water quality and heat flux inside the refrigeration condenser. The fouling resistance in the TTHE was observed to have asymptotic trend and the asymptotic limit was lower than that for BPHEs with soft corrugation angles and higher than that of BHPEs with hard corrugation angles operating at similar conditions. The hydraulic performance was similar as BPHEs with hard corrugation angles. The fouling deposit inside the tube-in-tube heat exchanger was further analyzed by using a CCD camera with a borescope probe and by adopting a chemical digestion process for the fouling particles inside the tubes. Fouling did not deposit uniformly inside the TTHE and it was evident that more fouling was present at the outlet section of the water side. The chemical analysis showed that more than 85 % of the fouling material was CaCO 3, which was expected from the chemical analysis of the water in critical saturation conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: One of {{the most}} costly {{problems}} in the maintenance of heat exchangers is de-fouling, which results in {{a waste of time}} and money. The present study includes two parts: the first section addresses <b>fouling</b> <b>factor,</b> its disadvantages, and circumstance of formation, fouling types, and general models of the fouling. In the second part, the problem of fouling in oil exchanger and particular type of fouling, namely, wax fouling in the oil mixtures has been studied. This paper reviews the fouling which is the most important parameter in designing heat exchanger and states the losses of the oil industry and other industries related to ignoring this issue. Failing to estimate this factor correctly, can result into problems in exchanger and as a result fluids of the process fail to reach the desired temperature. This paper tries to present solutions to deal with the problem of fouling in the oil industry and assesses the financial loss that comes from deposits in the industry...|$|E
40|$|Co-firing high {{shares of}} biomass with coal in {{pulverized}} fuel-fired furnaces may {{give rise to}} increased deposition of ash in the convective area (fouling). This paper describes first results of work aiming to develop a mathematical model {{as well as a}} system for the on-line monitoring of ash deposition in full-scale plants. Ash deposition experiments have been performed using a new type of deposition probe featuring on-line heat flux measurement. Ash deposits from straw, coal and a 20 / 80 %/ % mixture are compared. An initial increase of the derived <b>fouling</b> <b>factor</b> is attributed to the radiative properties of the first ash depositing on the probe. The subsequent decrease of the heat transfer is caused by the insulating effect of the growing ash deposit. A mathematical model is formulated to describe the processes of ash deposition in relation to local gas flow patterns; the model is a post-processor which uses the results of CFD calculations for input...|$|E
40|$|A unique {{test program}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate flue gas-side fouling and cleaning performance characteristics of a heat exchanger tube bundle for application in coal-fired environments. The test bundle contained helically finned tubes in a staggered arrangement. Air sootblowers were installed upstream and downstream of the test bundle to evaluate cleaning effectiveness during the fouling test. The bundle was installed in the outlet flue of a coal-fired test boiler to simulate flue gas and friable flyash conditions of a pulverized-coal-fired utility or industrial boiler. Thermal and hydraulic performance characteristics were measured {{to determine the effects}} of fouling and sootblower cleaning on bundle heat transfer and pressure drop. Results showed that ash deposits were controllable by sootblowing and that the bundle did not plug. The maximum <b>fouling</b> <b>factor</b> depended on sootblowing frequency, and there was no measurable increase in bundle pressure drop. Fouling-factor data were correlated against time, bundle geometry, and flue gas conditions for the two coals tested.

40|$|Heat {{recovery}} from exhaust gas streams is applicable {{to a wide}} variety of industries. Two problems encountered in exhaust gas heat recovery are: the high heat transfer resistance of gases and the presence of entrained particulate matter, which can limit the use of extended surface area. Standard heat exchangers use round tube. This study uses Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to investigate whether round or another shape is the best tube selection for exhaust heat recovery. Tube shape rankings are based on taking into account heat transfer, gas flow resistance and foulability. Foulability is inferred from the average wall shear stress around the front or back of each shape. An estimated asymptotic fouling resistance is used to calculate an equivalent <b>fouled</b> j <b>factor,</b> jf. CFD results suggest the best tube for exhaust heat recovery is an elliptical tube. The ellipse shape produced j/f and jf/f ratios (where f is the tube bank friction factor) over 1. 5 times larger than that of standard round tube. A flattened round tube is also promising and may be the practical and economic optimum...|$|R
40|$|Examination of {{activity}} demands and stoppage durations across game periods provides useful insight concerning fatigue, tactical strategies, and playing pace in team {{sports such as}} basketball. Therefore, the aims {{of this study were}} to quantify and compare game activity fluctuations across quarters in professional and semiprofessional basketball players. Video-based time-motion analyses were conducted across multiple games. Frequencies, total durations (in seconds), total distances (in meters), and mean velocities (in meters per second) were calculated for low-intensity movement (≤ 3 m·s - 1), high-intensity movement (> 3 m·s - 1), shuffling, and dribbling activity. Frequencies were determined for jumping and upper-body activity; stoppage durations were also calculated. Separate repeated-measures analysis of variance and Cohen's d were used to identify significant differences and quantify the effect sizes between game quarters for all outcome measures, respectively. Pearson correlation analyses were performed to determine the relationship between stoppage duration and all activity measures. The results showed significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) reduced dribbling (3. 09 ± 0. 03 m·s - 1 vs. 2. 81 ± 0. 01 m·s - 1) and total (2. 22 ± 0. 04 m·s - 1 vs. 2. 09 ± 0. 03 m·s - 1) activity velocities during the third compared with the first quarter in professional players. Furthermore, effect size analyses showed greater decreases in high-intensity (professional: d 1. 7 - 5. 4; semiprofessional: d 0. 3 - 1. 7), shuffling (professional: d 2. 3 - 3. 2; semiprofessional: d 1. 4 - 2. 1), and total (professional: d 1. 0 - 4. 9; semiprofessional: d 0. 3 - 0. 8) activity and increases in dribbling (professional: d 1. 4 - 4. 7; semiprofessional: d 2. 5 - 2. 8) with game progression in professional players. In semiprofessional players, stoppage duration was significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) related to various low-intensity (R 0. 64 - 0. 72), high-intensity (R 0. 65 - 0. 72), and total (R 0. 63 - 0. 73) activity measures. Although not directly measured, the observed game activity fluctuations were likely because of a combination of physiological (e. g., muscle glycogen depletion, dehydration), tactical (e. g., ball control, game pace), and game-related (e. g., time-outs, player <b>fouls)</b> <b>factors.</b> Basketball coaches can use the provided data to (a) develop more precise training plans and management strategies, (b) elevate semiprofessional player performance closer to the professional level, and (c) incorporate tactical strategies to maximize the benefits of stoppages...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a forward osmosis (FO) system may be characterised by the assessment parameters: FO-RO flux ratio (J w/J w(RO)), apparent FO water permeability (J w/(π ds-π ml)), and the newly developed flux efficiency factor (J w,ob/J w,re). The former two parameters offer information on extent of internal concentration polarisation and driving force utilisation, respectively. The J w,ob/J w,re factor has practical relevance, and reveals the inevitable trade-off between flux and recovery (φ) for a FO system. The derived J w,ob/J w,re factors corresponded well to experimental observations. High water permeability, low salt-to-water permeability ratio, and large mass transfer coefficient improve the {{performance of}} a FO system, but these may also be influenced by operational and fouling effects, such as draw solute transmission, fouling resistance and cake-enhanced concentration polarisation. It was shown that membrane properties also {{play a significant role in}} fouling behaviour. <b>Fouling</b> amelioration <b>factors</b> include aeration and osmotic backwash. A thin-film composite membrane showed potential for FO application with favourable intrinsic transport parameters. It was demonstrated that a FO system could achieve stable water production with both relatively high flux efficiency (J w,ob/J w,re= 0. 8) and high recovery (φ= 95. 8 %), which attested to the technology potential. © 2012 Elsevier B.
