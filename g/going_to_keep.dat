25|$|After its incorporation, Walpole {{had a role}} in {{the events}} leading up to the American Revolutionary War. The {{citizens}} agreed that the taxes imposed by the British government were unfair. They sent a representative, Joshua Clapp, to the state meetings at Faneuil Hall in Boston. These meetings were to discuss how Massachusetts was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> its residents safe and peaceful during the events of the American Revolutionary War. In 1775, Walpole sent 157 men to the Battle of Lexington and Concord. These men were led by Captain Seth Bullard. In December 1777, a British fleet of ships came into Narragansett Bay and anchored in Newport Harbor in Rhode Island. Walpole sent two groups of minutemen, consisting of 65 men in total, to help with the situation. These men were led by Joshua Clapp, and Oliver Clapp. They stayed in Rhode Island to defend the port for three weeks.|$|E
25|$|In January 2014, Geoff Johns {{announced}} that Lex Luthor and Captain Cold would be joining the Justice League. In {{the wake of}} the Crime Syndicate's invasion, public opinion of Lex Luthor was incredibly favorable, and he decided that he liked it. Another reason was he believed the entity that destroyed the Earth from the alternate universe which the Crime Syndicate came from was the larger threat and might eventually become a threat to their universe and wanted the Justice League to be prepared for that possibility beforehand. In an effort to continue being regarded as a hero, he tried to convince the Justice League to recruit him, but was initially unsuccessful. The Justice League eventually talked about how Luthor was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on his crusade with or without the help of the Justice League. They let Luthor join the Justice League knowing he could find out information that could put all of them in danger, but Batman figured at least they could keep a close watch on Luthor and LexCorp, and much to the chagrin of Superman, Luthor secured a place in the Justice League, even building a new Watchtower for them and recruiting Shazam onto the team.|$|E

500|$|The {{show was}} {{controversial}} from its beginning {{and has made}} the news several times. In the early seasons, some parents and conservatives characterized Bart as a poor role model for children and several United States public schools even banned The Simpsons merchandise and t-shirts. In January 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush made a speech during his re-election campaign in which he said: [...] "We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons."

500|$|The January 30, 1992 rerun of {{the episode}} {{featured}} a brief alternate opening, which was written {{in response to a}} comment made by the then President of the United States, George Bush, three days earlier. The show had previously had a [...] "feud" [...] with the President's wife Barbara Bush when, in the October 1, 1990 edition of People, she called The Simpsons [...] "the dumbest thing [...] had ever seen". The writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter to Bush in which they posed as Marge Simpson. Bush immediately sent a reply in which she apologized. Later, on January 27, 1992, George Bush made a speech during his re-election campaign which included the statement [...] "we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons." ...|$|E
500|$|Noel Murray from The A.V.

[...] Murray concluded his review, [...] "It may be that Fringe has bitten off more than it can chew here, and the storytelling is about to get hopelessly convoluted, as it often does once time-travel enters the picture. But for now, I’m going to enjoy living with and thinking over what I’ve seen so far. And I’m going to trust that no matter how crazy Fringes fourth season gets, the writers are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> bringing everything back to less mind-bending questions". Some reviewers questioned the logic of Peter having never existed, though others expressed their trust in the writers' ability to make it work.|$|E

First baseman Bruce Bochte said, [...] "Steve indicated {{there was a lot of}} talk going around, that his situation wasn't stable.

500|$|On January 27, 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush made {{a speech}} during his {{re-election}} campaign that reignited the feud between The Simpsons and the Bushes. At that point, family values were the cornerstone of Bush's campaign platform, to which effect he gave the following speech at the National Religious Broadcasters' convention in Washington, D.C.: [...] "We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons". The next broadcast of The Simpsons was a rerun of [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] on January 30, 1992. It included a new opening, which {{was a response to}} Bush's speech. The scene begins in the Simpsons' living room. Homer, Bart, Lisa, and Patty and Selma all stare at the television and watch Bush's speech. After Bush's statement, Bart replies [...] "Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying {{for an end to the}} Depression too." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode makes {{references}} to several real-life persons. The piano-playing satirist who annoys Bart is {{a reference to}} Mark Russell and/or Tom Lehrer. Bob Arnold, the corrupt congressman, tells Lisa that {{there are quite a}} few women senators, but Lisa asserts that there are only two. At the time of airing there were indeed only two female senators: Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. Then-President George H. W. Bush is featured briefly in the episode. Shortly after it aired, Bush disparaged The Simpsons in a speech during his re-election campaign on January 27, 1992. At that point family values were the cornerstone of Bush's campaign platform, so he gave the following speech at the National Religious Broadcasters' convention in Washington: [...] "We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons." [...] As a result, Bush appeared in future episodes in a more negative light.|$|E
500|$|Joel Keller of TV Squad said {{he enjoyed}} seeing Ron {{stand up for}} the parks department, which proved that despite his hatred of government, he knows his {{co-workers}} well and is a good boss. Keller also praised Pamela Reed's performance and said she works well with Amy Poehler. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic said although he believed the no-dating policy was little more than an unnecessary device meant to create friction between Leslie and Ben, he enjoyed the lengths with which they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their relationship secret. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called [...] "The Bubble" [...] an excellent episode that went a long way in fleshing out the Leslie and Ben romance, but primarily set the scene for the superior [...] "Li'l Sebastian". Time magazine writer James Poniewozik said [...] "The Bubble" [...] was not as funny as some of the better third season episodes like [...] "Harvest Festival" [...] or [...] "Andy and April's Fancy Party", but was nonetheless enjoyable and [...] "perfectly funny".|$|E

LeMond continued, [...] "I decided that day that nobody's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> me from cycling, not Trek, not Armstrong, not Verbruggen, not anybody." [...] At the time, LeMond was alluding to a series of public and private disputes related to his anti-doping advocacy that hampered his enjoyment of cycling. Especially significant was LeMond's appearance as a USADA witness in the Floyd Landis doping case. There, on the eve of LeMond's testimony in May 2007, Landis' business manager called and threatened to disclose publicly that LeMond was the victim of childhood sexual abuse, should he appear in court as scheduled the following day. Undeterred, LeMond took the stand and testified, before admitting to the world that he had been molested.|$|E

The criticism eventually led to the idea for the episode [...] "Two Bad Neighbors", which has George and Barbara move into the house across the street from the Simpsons.|$|E
500|$|The {{season premiere}} episode was [...] "Stark Raving Dad", which guest starred Michael Jackson as the {{speaking}} voice of Leon Kompowsky. One of Jackson's conditions for guest starring {{was that he}} voiced himself under a pseudonym. While he recorded the voice work for the character, all of his singing was performed by Kipp Lennon, because Jackson wanted to play a joke on his brothers. Michael Jackson's lines were recorded at a second session by Brooks.
