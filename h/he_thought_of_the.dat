5|$|Herrmann {{used the}} lowered music budget to his {{advantage}} by writing for a string orchestra rather than a full symphonic ensemble, contrary to Hitchcock's request for a jazz score. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> single tone color of the all-string soundtrack {{as a way of}} reflecting the black-and-white cinematography of the film. The strings play con sordini (muted) for all the music other than the shower scene, creating a darker and more intense effect. Film composer Fred Steiner, in an analysis of the score to Psycho, points out that string instruments gave Herrmann access to a wider range in tone, dynamics, and instrumental special effects than any other single instrumental group would have.|$|E

500|$|Morgan was {{inspired}} to write this episode after seeing men working on an open escalator in a mall around Christmas time. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scare factor from a creature living underneath the escalator, and felt Tooms {{would be the perfect}} choice for the creature. Tooms was the first villain in the show's history to make an appearance in a second episode. It was actor Doug Hutchison's idea to play Tooms nude during the escalator sequence, a decision which Carter felt [...] "caused a little discomfort", but that [...] "actually added to the scene". The bile-like substance coating Tooms and his nest was actually a yellow piping gel, which the cast found would stick to their skin and pull out hair upon removal. Tooms framing Mulder for assault seems to have been inspired by a similar plot point in the film Dirty Harry.|$|E
500|$|Davies is an {{admitted}} procrastinator {{and often}} waits hours or days for concepts to form before he commits {{them to the}} script. In The Writer's Tale, he describes his procrastination by discussing his early career: at the time, his method {{of dealing with the}} pressures of delivering a script was to [...] "go out drinking" [...] instead. On one occasion in the mid-1990s, he was at the Manchester gay club Cruz 101 when <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> climax to the first series of The Grand. As his career progressed, he instead spent entire nights [...] "just thinking of plot, character, pace, etc" [...] and waited until 2:00am, [...] "when the clubs used to shut", to overcome the urge of procrastination.

500|$|Barrett had one noted {{reunion with}} the members of Pink Floyd, in 1975 during the {{recording}} sessions for Wish You Were Here. He attended the Abbey Road session unannounced, and watched the band working on the final mix of [...] "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" [...] — a song that happened to be about him. By that time, the 29-year-old Barrett had become quite overweight, had shaved off all of his hair (including his eyebrows), and his former bandmates did not initially recognise him. Barrett's behaviour at the session was erratic; he spent part of the session brushing his teeth. Roger Waters finally managed to ask him what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song and he simply said that it [...] "sounds a bit old". He briefly attended the reception for Gilmour's wedding to Ginger that immediately followed the recording sessions; however, he left early without exchanging goodbyes with the newlyweds.|$|E
500|$|As Edgeworth {{had been}} a popular {{character}} ever since start of the series, Takumi {{found it difficult to}} come up with a way to bring him back without having him, a supposedly great prosecutor, always lose to Phoenix. While he was writing the story for the game's final case, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> idea to have Edgeworth become a player character; he liked this idea so much that he immediately started to rewrite the case. In order to allow Edgeworth to be the player character, the first thing he did was to [...] "get rid of" [...] Phoenix by having him fall from a bridge into an icy river. He enjoyed writing from another character's perspective, who thought differently from Phoenix; he also used the case to explore the relationship between Edgeworth and Gumshoe. One of the game's episodes had originally been written for Justice for All: it had been intended as the fourth episode of Justice for All, but was cut due to memory limiations, and ended up being reused as the third episode of Trials and Tribulations.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 15 November, Pedro II was in Petrópolis when he {{received}} the first telegram from Ouro Preto informing him of the rebellion. However, he did not assign much import to the news. At 11a.m. as he left a mass {{in honor of the}} 45th anniversary of his sister Maria II's death, the monarch received a second telegram and decided to return to Rio de Janeiro. His wife expressed concern, but he told her, [...] "On what ma'am? When I arrive there it will be over!" [...] He travelled by train, reading periodicals and scientific magazines. Not imagining the gravity of the situation, he arrived at the city palace at 3p.m. André Rebouças suggested that he go to the countryside to organize resistance. The Marquis of Tamandaré asked for his permission to lead the Armada (navy) and suppress the rebellion. He dismissed all the ideas put forward and said, [...] "This is nothing. I know my countrymen." [...] The Emperor asked the Conservative senator Manuel Francisco Correia what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation. Correia answered that he believed that {{it was the end of}} the monarchy. Pedro II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the possibility.|$|E

500|$|Zwingli criticised the {{practice}} of priestly chanting and monastic choirs. The criticism dates from 1523 when he attacked certain worship practices. His arguments are detailed in the Conclusions of 1525, in which, Conclusions 44, 45 and 46 are concerned with musical practices {{under the rubric of}} [...] "prayer". He associated music with images and vestments, all of which he felt diverted people's attention from true spiritual worship. It is not known what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> musical practices in early Lutheran churches. Zwingli, however, eliminated instrumental music from worship in the church, stating that God had not commanded it in worship. The organist of the People's Church in Zurich is recorded as weeping upon seeing the great organ broken up. Although Zwingli did not express an opinion on congregational singing, he made no effort to encourage it. Nevertheless, scholars have found that Zwingli was supportive of a role for music in the church. Gottfried W. Locher writes, [...] "The old assertion 'Zwingli was against church singing' holds good no longer... Zwingli's polemic is concerned exclusively with the medieval Latin choral and priestly chanting and not with the hymns of evangelical congregations or choirs". Locher {{goes on to say that}} [...] "Zwingli freely allowed vernacular psalm or choral singing. In addition, he even seems to have striven for lively, antiphonal, unison recitative". Locher then summarizes his comments on Zwingli's view of church music as follows: [...] "The chief thought in his conception of worship was always 'conscious attendance and understanding'—'devotion', yet with the lively participation of all concerned".|$|E
500|$|Will & Grace creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan based {{the show}} on their own lives. Mutchnick, who is openly gay, based the {{relationship}} between Will and Grace on his real-life relationship with a woman named Janet. Originally, Mutchnick and Kohan first went to the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), who told them to create a television series about a new young love story, as Mad About You was going off the air. The character of Will {{was part of a}} sitcom Mutchnick and Kohan first pitched to NBC executives in 1997. The original concept was an ensemble comedy featuring three couples, one of which was a gay man living with a straight woman. Warren Littlefield, the executive vice president of NBC at the time, was not excited about the first two couples, but wanted {{to learn more about the}} gay and straight couple, so Mutchnick and Kohan was sent to create a pilot script centering on those two characters. NBC went to sitcom director James Burrows to see what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> homosexual subject matter and if an audience would be interested in the show. Burrows liked the idea and when he first read the script in November 1997, he decided that he wanted to direct it. Burrows said, [...] "I knew that the boys had captured a genre and a group of characters I have never read before." [...] The filming of the pilot began in March 1998. The actors who played Will and Grace, Eric McCormack and Debra Messing, were positive about the series and they thought it had the potential to last on television. McCormack said, [...] "When shooting was finished that night, Debra and I were sitting on the couch and looking at each other and I said, ‘We’re gonna be on this set for a while.’ And we sort of clasped hands, but we didn’t want to say anything beyond that and jinx it." ...|$|E
