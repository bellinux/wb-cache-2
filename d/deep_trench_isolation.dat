Lately, other substrates, such as silicon-on-insulator has become in use which requires a greater control of the silicon CMP process. CMP is used to planarize oxide interlevel dielectric and to remove excessive tungsten after plug filling in the Al interconnection technology. In Cu interconnection technology, the plugs and wiring are filled in one step and excessive Cu is removed by CMP. In front end processing, CMP is used to realize shallow trench isolation (STI), to planarize trench capacitors in dynamic random access memories (DRAM) and in novel gate concepts. This thesis is focused on CMP for front end processing, which is the processing on the device level and the starting material. The effects of dopants, crystal orientation and process parameters on silicon removal rate are investigated. CMP and silicon wafer bonding is investigated. Also, plasma assisted wafer bonding to form InP MOS structures is investigated.

40|$|SiGe is a {{significant}} enabling technology for therealization of integrated circuits used in high performanceoptical networks and radio frequency applications. In order tocontinue to fulfill the demands for these applications, newmaterials and device structures are needed. This thesis focuseson new materials and their integration into heterojunctionbipolar transistor (HBT) structures as well as using devicesimulations to optimize and better understand the deviceoperation. Specifically, a SiGeC HBT platform was designed,fabricated, and electrically characterized. The platformfeatures a non-selectively grown epitaxial SiGeC base,in situdoped polysilicon emitter, nickel silicide,LOCOS isolation, and a minimum emitter width of 0. 4 μm. Alternately, a selective epitaxy growth in an oxide window wasused to form the collector and isolation regions. Thetransistors exhibited cutoff frequency (fT) and maximum frequency of oscillation (fMAX) of 40 - 80 GHz and 15 - 45 GHz, respectively. Lateral design rules allowed the investigation of behavior suchas transient enhanced diffusion, leakage current, and theinfluence of parasitics such as base resistance and CBC. The formation of nickel silicide on polysiliconSiGe and SiGeC films was also investigated. The formation ofthe low resistivity monosilicide phase was shown to occur athigher temperatures on SiGeC than on SiGe. The stability of themonosilicide was also shown to improve for SiGeC. Nickelsilicide was then integrated into a SiGeC HBT featuring aselectively grown collector. A novel, fully silicided extrinsicbase contact was demonstrated along with the simultaneousformation of NiSi on thein situdoped polysilicon emitter. High-resolution x-ray diffraction (HRXRD) was used toinvestigate the growth and stability of SiGeC base layers forHBT integration. HRXRD {{proved to be an}} effective, fast,non-destructive tool for monitoring carbon out-diffusion due tothe dopant activation anneal for different temperatures as wellas for inline process monitoring of epitaxial growth of SiGeClayers. The stability of the SiGe layer with 0. 2 - 0. 4 at% carbonwhen subjected to dopant activation anneals ranging from 1020 - 1100 &# 176 C was analyzed by reciprocal lattice mapping. It was found that as the substitutional carbon increases theformation of boron clusters due to diffusion is suppressed, buta higher density of carbon clusters is formed. Device simulations were performed to optimize the DC and HFperformance of an advanced SiGeC HBT structure with low baseresistance and small dimension emitter widths. The selectivelyimplanted collector (SIC) was studied using a design ofexperiments (DOE) method. For small dimensions the lateralimplantation straggle has {{a significant}} influence on the SICprofile (width). A significant influence of the SIC width onthe DC gain was observed. The optimized structure showedbalanced fT/fMAXvalues of 200 + GHz. Finally, SOI BJT transistorswith <b>deep</b> <b>trench</b> <b>isolation</b> were fabricated in a 0. 25 μmBiCMOS process and self-heating effects were characterized andcompared to transistors on bulk silicon featuring deep trenchand shallow trench isolation.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} advanced circuits in CMOS for {{microwave and}} millimeter-wave communications. First, low- noise W-band amplifiers and mW-level 170 - 200 GHz output doublers in 45 -nm Semiconductor-On-Insulator (SOI) CMOS technology are presented. The transistors are modeled using R/C extraction and full electromagnetic modeling. The measured ft of a 30 x 1 -[mu]m transistor is 200 - 210 GHz at a bias current of 0. 3 - 0. 5 mA/[mu]m. A 3 -stage W-band amplifier shows a record noise figure of 6. 0 dB and a saturated output power of 7. 5 - 8. 0 dBm {{with a power}} added efficiency of 9 %, all at 95 GHz. The G-band balanced doubler results in an output power of 1 mW at 180 GHz. A W -band amplifier/G-band doubler chip is also demonstrated, with a peak output power of 0. 5 - 1 mW at 170 - 195 GHz and a conversion gain of - 2 - - 1 dB. This work shows that 45 -nm SOI CMOS, built for digital and mixed-signal applications, results in state-of-the-art performance at W-band and G- band. Next, a miniature DC- 70 GHz single-pole four-throw (SP 4 T), 50 - 70 GHz single-pole double-throw (SPDT), and single-pole four-throw (SP 4 T) switches built in a low-cost 0. 13 -[mu]m CMOS process are presented. The DC- 70 GHz SP 4 T switch {{is based on a}} series-shunt design with input and output matching circuits. Deep n-well (also called triple- well) CMOS transistors are used to minimize the substrate coupling. Also, <b>deep</b> <b>trench</b> <b>isolation</b> is used between the different ports to minimize the port-to-port coupling. The SP 4 T results in a measured insertion loss of less than 3. 5 dB up to 67 GHz with an isolation of greater than 25 dB. The measured port-to-port coupling is less than 28 dB up to 67 GHz. The measured P 1 dB and IIP 3 are independent of frequency and are 9 - 10 dBm and 20 - 21 dBm, respectively. The active chip area is 0. 24 x 0. 23 mm². When this work was published, it represented the widest bandwidth SP 4 T switch in any CMOS technology to-date. The 50 - 70 GHz single-pole double-throw (SPDT) and single-pole four-throw (SP 4 T) switches are based on tuned [lambda]/ 4 designs with output matching networks. High substrate resistance together with deep trenches and isolation moats are used for low insertion loss. The SPDT and SP 4 T switches result in a measured insertion loss of 2. 0 and 2. 3 dB at 60 GHz, with an isolation of > 32 dB and > 22 dB, respectively. The measured output port-to-port isolation is > 27 dB for both designs. The P 1 dB is 13 - 14 dBm with a measured IIP 3 of > 23 dBm for both switches. Both designs have a return loss better than - 10 dB at all ports from 50 to 70 GHz. The active chip area is 0. 39 x 0. 32 mm² (SPDT) and 0. 59 x 0. 45 mm² (SP 4 T). When this work was published, it presented the lowest loss 60 GHz SPDT and SP 4 T switches and also the highest isolation SPDT switch in any CMOS technology to- date. In another project, 5 - 6 GHz 8 x 8 and Ku-band 4 x 4 Butler matrices are presented in a 0. 13 -[mu]m CMOS implementation. The 8 x 8 design results in an insertion loss of 3. 5 dB at 5. 5 GHz, with a bandwidth of 5 - 6 GHz and no power consumption. The chip area is 2. 5 x 1. 9 mm² including all pads. The 8 x 8 matrix is mounted on a Teflon board with 8 -antennas, and the measured patterns agree well with theory and show an isolation of > 12 dB at 5 - 6 GHz. The 4 x 4 design results in an insertion loss of 2. 4 dB at 12 GHz with a bandwidth of 11 - 13 GHz. The chip area is only 0. 85 x 0. 65 mm² including all pads, and the power consumption is 0 ̃ mA from a 1. 5 V power supply. The 4 x 4 matrix is mounted on a Teflon board with 4 -antennas, and the measured patterns agree well with theory and show an isolation of > 11 dB at 11 - 13 GHz. CMOS Butler matrices are an excellent candidate for MIMO systems, and can also replace small-element phased-array systems for high-gain transceivers. The applications areas are in high data-rate communications. Finally, a contactless, microwave-based gamma ray detector for detecting low-energy gamma ray photons is presented as an appendix. The detection is based on a microwave cavity perturbation method, and uses a reflection-type cavity resonator with a detector-grade CZT crystal. The reflected power from the cavity is measured and this monitors the changes in the photoconductivity of the CZT crystal {{in the presence of a}} gamma-ray.
