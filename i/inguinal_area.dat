There may also be pain in the <b>inguinal</b> <b>area</b> but no nausea or other symptoms. Back pain may be concurrent or absent and some patients have a long history of low back pain. Onset of pain is commonly related to activity that would stress the low back such as lifting heavy objects. Other stresses that might cause low back pain are imaginative coital positions, jogging, sitting hunched over a computer, long car driving, or other such positions of unsupported seating posture that flattens the normal lumbar lordosis curve." ...|$|E
50|$|Females {{are able}} to {{reproduce}} from one year old or 425g. Mating commences from late winter to early spring with a gestation period of 34 days. Water rats have four mammae with nipples located in the abdominal <b>inguinal</b> <b>area</b> enabling litters of an average of four to five are born from September to February and are suckled for four weeks. Sexual maturity develops at around twelve months but has been documented to commence at 4 months and breeding in the season of their birth. They {{are able to}} continuing breeding until females are {{three and a half}} years old, and have a life expectancy of 3-4 years.A territorial species, they are mostly solitary excluding the periods of mating and rearing their young. Their social organisation suggests adults are intra-sexually aggressive with their limited home range and overlapping sex and age classes. In captivity only the dominant female in the hierarchy will successfully reproduce. Fecundity is lower than that of other murid species producing only four to five litters, but fertility is very high which can create high population growth in period of favourable breeding conditions. This can be also influenced by the rapid growth in juveniles who can reach maturity and size within their first year.|$|E
