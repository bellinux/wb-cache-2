500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2013–14 season, Paul re-signed with the Clippers for five years on a {{contract}} worth approximately $107 million. Despite a shoulder injury that sidelined him for over a month, Los Angeles set another new franchise record for wins with 57. His final averages were 19.1 points, 10.7 assists, and 2.5 steals per game. In Game 1 of the second round of the playoffs, he hit a career postseason-high eight three-pointers to help the Clippers take an early series lead over the Oklahoma City Thunder.

We wanted to create an air of tension. With <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened,</b> we wanted to explain what it could be. At every point, everything can be explained. Was she taken or killed by her boyfriend, who she was seeing against her mother's wishes? Is it Twin Peaks or an alien abduction? That was the theme of the show." [...] Gordon and Gansa were afraid that series creator Chris Carter would not like the script, but Carter liked the script and approved the episode they wrote.|$|E

500|$|In 1939, Rockwell {{moved to}} Arlington, Vermont, {{which was an}} artist-friendly {{community}} that had hosted Robert Frost, Rockwell Kent, and Dorothy Canfield Fisher. Of the move from New Rochelle, New York, Rockwell said [...] "I was restless... The town [...] seemed tinged with <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> to me". In New Rochelle, he had both endured a divorce and run with a fast crowd. Artists John Atherton, Mead Schaeffer and George Hughes established residences in Arlington soon after Rockwell. The resident artists, Rockwell included, were mutually supportive and hired local citizens as their amateur models. Using photography and Arlington residents as models, Rockwell was able to capture what he referred to as [...] "human-looking humans", who were generally working-class people, {{in an hour or}} so rather than hire professional models for the entire day. Rockwell paid his models modestly. Rose Hoyt, who was engaged for a total of three photographic sessions for Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Worship, earned $15 ($ in [...] dollars) for her sittings.|$|E
500|$|According to Richard Freedman of the Newhouse News Service, [...] "This must be {{the first}} version of the Faust myth in which not only does Faust (or Faustina , here) manage to weasel out of the pact with the Devil, but succeeds in {{regenerating}} him, as well." [...] Elliot Krieger of Rhode Island's Providence Journal also took note of such a theme, headlining his review [...] "Faust goes to summer camp". [...] In regards to continuity issues, a reviewer in The Scarecrow Movie Guide observed a [...] "montage showing the Care Bears and their Cousins growing up together from infancy to full Care Bear maturationnullifying <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> in the first movie". [...] Mike McLane of Florida's Gainesville Sun gave a few suggestions of the storyline's possible religious subtext. [...] He compared the Great Wishing Star to God, the Bears' [...] "beautiful cloud kingdom" [...] of Care-a-Lot to Heaven, and Dark Heart to Satan; he also hinted that the Bears protected humankind like angels did.|$|E

[...] He added that he loved Chilli, however, [...] "...it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash..." [...] Although [...] "Burn" [...] is a reference to his dying relationship with Chilli—hence the title—Usher answered the press that the impregnating issue was not taken from a specific situation in his life. He also revealed that his friends who went through similar situations inspired him to write those songs: [...] "...it's just something that I collectively got energy from everybody around me that had been through it." [...] In early 2006, Dupri revealed that {{the story behind the}} album is his: [...] "...me cheating on my steady girlfriend, having a baby with that other woman and having to confess to <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> to my main girl." ...|$|E

This whole episode was Maddy living out her perfect day in her head. On October 21, 2009, Chantelle was admitted to AAU, pregnant after her boyfriend kicked her in the stomach. Despite telling Maria she didn't kill Maddy, she actually confessed to the murder after Mark told her of the consequences about her lying about her boyfriend abusing her and killing Maddy.|$|E
500|$|Sometimes, Mary and George {{appear to}} have been distant parents. At first, they failed to notice the nanny's abuse of the young Princes Edward and Albert, and their {{youngest}} son, Prince John, was housed in a private farm on the Sandringham Estate, in Bill's care, perhaps to hide his epilepsy from the public. However, despite Mary's austere public image and her strait-laced private life, Mary was a caring mother in many respects, revealing a fun-loving and frivolous side to her children and teaching them history and music. Edward wrote fondly of his mother in his memoirs: [...] "Her soft voice, her cultivated mind, the cosy room overflowing with personal treasures were all inseparable ingredients of the happiness associated with this last hour of a child's day... Such was my mother's pride in her children that <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> to each one was of the utmost importance to her. With the birth of each new child, Mama started an album in which she painstakingly recorded each progressive stage of our childhood". He expressed a less charitable view, however, in private letters to his wife after his mother's death: [...] "My sadness was mixed with incredulity that any mother could have been so hard and cruel towards her eldest son for so many years and yet so demanding at the end without relenting a scrap. I'm afraid the fluids in her veins have always been as icy cold as they are now in death." ...|$|E

Back in the [...] "green reality", Michael goes to the hotel, since Alina had left {{in the middle of}} the night. Once there, Marcus warns Michael and Bird that if they do not find her, Marcus will give himself up to Maxim Basayev, his mobster boss. Back at the station, after looking at evidence, Michael decides to talk to the hotel staff where Alina and Marcus are staying, with Bird, rather than Alina's friends. Later, Michael and Bird go to the home of Greg Hollander (Ron Melendez), one of Alina's friends, but do not find Greg, the person they would like to question regarding Alina's whereabouts. Hollander, who is tied up, kicks down a table as the detectives leave, notifying the cops that he is in there. As the criminals run away, Bird and Michael break into the house; Bird and Michael enter the house, while Bird shoots the two gang members. After that, they speak to Greg, who tells them that Alina constantly talks about how she and her husband have grown apart. Michael goes to search for Alina at a beach and finds her there. The two talk about Marcus and <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> previously. Michael explains that she has a chance to start over and takes her back to the hotel. In the [...] "red reality", at Jake's home, Jake says he and Vega can have dinner alone to get to know each other. That night, Michael and Hannah go nude swimming at the college pool.|$|E
