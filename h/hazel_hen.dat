5|$|The least weasel feeds {{predominantly}} on mouse-like rodents, including mice, hamsters, gerbils and others. It {{usually does}} not attack adult hamsters and rats. Frogs, fish, small birds and bird eggs are rarely eaten. It {{can deal with}} adult pikas and gerbils, but usually cannot overcome brown rats and sousliks. Exceptional cases are known of least weasels killing prey far larger than themselves, such as capercaillie, <b>hazel</b> <b>hen</b> and hares. In England, a favoured prey item is the field vole (Microtus agrestis). These have fluctuations in population size, and in years of abundance may form up to 54% of the weasel's diet. In years of scarcity, birds form {{a greater proportion of}} the diet and female least weasels may fail to breed.|$|E

60|$|A {{few words}} on the latest attempt which {{has been made to}} naturalize an exotic bird in England will not seem out of place here. About eight years ago a gentleman in Essex {{introduced}} the rufous tinamou--a handsome game bird, nearly as large as a fowl--into his estate. Up till the present time, or till quite recently these birds have bred every year, and at one time they had increased considerably and scattered about the neighbourhood. When it began to increase, the neighbouring proprietors and sportsmen generally were asked not to shoot it, but to give it a chance, and {{there is reason to believe}} that they have helped to protect it, and have taken a great interest in the experiment. Whatever the ultimate result may be, the partial success attained during these few years is decidedly encouraging, and that for more reasons than one. In the first place, the bird was badly chosen for such an experiment. It belongs to the pampas of La Plata, to which it is restricted, and where it enjoys a dry, bright climate, and lives concealed in the tall close-growing indigenous grasses. The conditions of its habitat are therefore widely different from those of Essex, or of any part of England; and, besides, it has a peculiar organisation, for it happens to be one of those animals of ancient types of which a few species still survive in South America. That so unpromising a subject as this large archaic tinamou should be able to maintain its existence in this country, even for a very few years, encourages one to believe that with better-chosen species, more highly organized, and with more pliant habits, such as the <b>hazel</b> <b>hen</b> of Europe for a game bird, success would be almost certain.|$|E

40|$|The common {{approach}} to solve linear program (LP) arising from an energy system model (ESM) {{is based on}} the shared memory paradigm. However, the apparent simplicity of the non-uniform memory access architecture (NUMA) limits the scalability of the underlying hardware components, such as the memory and compute units. On the other hand, increasing of the resolution in spatial and temporal data of ESM requires more and more computational resources. High Performance Computing (HPC) provides a technical solution to overcome these limitations. Use of HPC demands changes to the existing ESM solving framework. This talk presents the latest results obtained in the BEAM-ME project. We discuss the central questions that came up during integration of the parallel optimization solver PIPS in the framework of GAMS language, which is widely used in the field of ESM. Based on a block structured (stochastic) linear problem, the results regarding the scalability and efficiency of the HPC solution were obtained on two Petaflops supercomputers: <b>Hazel</b> <b>Hen,</b> a Cray XC 40 -system, at High Performance Computing Center Stuttgart (HLRS) and JURECA, a fat-tree EDR-InfiniBand cluster, at Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC) ...|$|E
40|$|DASH is {{a library}} of {{distributed}} data structures and algorithms designed for running the applications on modern HPC architectures, composed of hierarchical network interconnections and stratified memory. DASH implements a PGAS (partitioned global address space) model {{in the form of}} C++ templates, built on top of DART [...] a run-time system with an abstracted tier above existing one-sided communication libraries. In order to facilitate the application development process for exploiting the hierarchical organization of HPC machines, DART allows to reorder the placement of the computational units. In this paper we present an automatic, hierarchical units mapping technique (using a similar approach to the Hilbert curve transformation) to reorder the placement of DART units on the Cray XC 40 machine <b>Hazel</b> <b>Hen</b> at HLRS. To evaluate the performance of new units mapping which takes into the account the topology of allocated compute nodes, we perform latency benchmark for a 3 D stencil code. The technique of units mapping is generic and can be be adopted in other DART communication substrates and on other hardware platforms. Furthermore, high [...] level features of DASH are presented, enabling more complex automatic transformations and optimizations in the future.

40|$|ON FAUNA OF INTEREST TO HUNTERSIN THE FRENCH ALPS - Both for Mammalia and Birds the Alps offer special biologicalconditions, {{very similar}} to those of the polar regions, but differingby the regular diurnal changes of day and night. Thepresent alpine fauna is paleontologically of mixed origin : arctic,mediterranean and oriental. Its whole history is {{dominated}} bythe glacial period. At the end of the latter, a few species of thearctic fauna (The Reindeer, the Wolverene, the Musk-Ox) havemoved up northwards and without settling in the mountainswhich do not suit them. But, on the other hand, the Lynx, theVariable Hare and the Common Ptarmigan present alpine, aswell as nordic forms. The eastern element is represented bythe Ibex, the Chamois and the Rock Partridge. The mediterraneanelements, few in number, are all birds, of which somemust be looked upon as autochtonous and preglacial : the SnowVole, the alpine Shrew, the Bearded Vulture, the water-ousel,the alpine crows. Water fowl from the North may stop in thecourse of their peregrinations, but none of them makes its nestthere. Before turning to the alpine animals of special interest to thehunter it may be stated that the Red-deer still survived in theAlps (of Savoy) as recently as about 1870, and that the Wolf,who disappeared from the Dauphiné in 1883, had survived inthe Savoy country down to the end of the XIXth century. The author then overlooks the alpine Mammalia : the Ibex,whom Italian protection has succeeded in preserving; the Chamois,whose numbers have varied but who still exists ratherabundantly now adays; the Marmot, a hibernating animalbuilding burrows and hawing many biological peculiarities; theVariable Hare, who during the winter becomes entirely white; the Bear, who still survives in the Vercors region of the Dauphinéand on the border between the Dauphiné and the Savoy;finally the Lynx, who has almost entirely disappeared from theFrench Alps. Of the birds, the Capercaillie has, so to speak, gone from theFrench Alps. The Black Grouse, on the contrary, is still plentiful. The <b>Hazel</b> <b>Hen</b> lives in the woods, and the CommonPtarmigan, whose moulting is so interesting, is found on theupper pasture lands. Hunters frequently confound the RockPartridge with the Red-legged Partridge. Mention must finallybe made of the great birds of prey, the Golden Eagle, who becomesmore rare every year, and the Bearded Vulture, who isnearly extinct...|$|E
