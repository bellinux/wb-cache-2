40|$|Artificial ground {{freezing}} (AFG) {{is a well}} established technique first practised in South Wales in 1862. Since then many different temporary and permanent applications have been developed. AFG is mostly used in tunnels and for stabilising excavations, {{but there is an}} increasing interest in using AFG for environmental protection and for using freeze/thaw cycles for remediation of contaminated soil. Freeze dredging is a novel <b>dredging</b> <b>technique</b> developed at Luleå University of Technology in co-operation with industrial partners. The contaminated sediment is first stabilised by freezing, and then the frozen sediment is lifted up above the water with a minimum of disturbance of the surrounding soil. Full-scale field tests have been performed with very good results. It has been hypothesised that underwater freezing can be used also for removal or radioactive material, fragile containers with hazardous content, and ammunition. This paper describes the basic principles of the technology and lessons learned from the full scale tests. It also deals with considerations necessary for designing a system for underwater freezing of different materials. Godkänd; 2003; 20090814 (svek...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} an {{improved}} harbor access resulted {{in the construction of}} two new rubble mound breakwaters in Ostend, Belgium. In the past, a specific <b>dredging</b> <b>technique</b> was used to maintain the required depth of the access channel to the harbor. This has resulted in a complex soil layering underneath {{the northern part of the}} new western breakwater with locally very thick soft soil layers. As an alternative for an expensive soil remediation, a very strong geotextile was included into the breakwater core, reinforcing the structure. In addition a staged construction was necessary, allowing the soft layers to consolidate and preventing undrained failure during construction. Because of the complexity of the situation, a numerical model was used to get an estimate of the settlements and the consolidation process during and after construction of the breakwater. Extensive field measurements of the settlements were performed during construction and are still performed at this moment (early 2013). Comparison of the settlement measurements with the calculations results in a better understanding of the consolidation process and allows improvement of the model, resulting in a more accurate settlement (and thus consolidation) prediction curve. Because of the improved insight in the consolidation of the soft layer, a substantial gain in the progress of the construction of the dam is achieved. This paper shows, based on a case study of a breakwater constructed on soft soil, that existing models used to predict settlements can be improved using field data, leading to a clear benefit regarding the construction phasing...|$|E

Many of these deposits can be exploited {{in shallow water}} using currently-available technology including drilling platforms, solution extraction, and underground mining from onshore installations which extend offshore.

Deposits of this second group include construction materials, some placer deposits, phosphorites, and glauconite, all of which are found primarily on the shelf and upper slope; and deposits of the deeper oceans, including deep-sea oozes, manganese nodules, and metalliferous muds and brines. <b>Dredging</b> <b>techniques</b> are used for exploiting superficial deposits in shallow waters; various types of dredges are being tested, or are planned for the deeper-water deposits.

40|$|The {{underwater}} mining {{has increased}} {{in the recent years}} and the growing awareness of the potential impacts on the environment, as results of increasing the encroachment on the marine environment. Therefore, the debate has increased about how to protect this environment by using the scientific research thatś relevant to the various environmental effects and developing the equipment used in dredging. There is a wide diversity of underwater mining equipments, such as continuous and non-continuous dredging which used for production of sand, gravel, alluvial deposits and raw material. There are a relation between increasingly dredging activities in the recent years and their impacts on the aquatic environment. These impacts are causes by changes in the topography of the sea floor such as turbidity, noise and other environmental impacts. Today, there is an international framework of legislation which has been developed for dredging projects. This contains rules and regulations which must be followed by mining companies and have to implemented by national authorities. The European countries also develop their legislation to control on the dredged material which deposit on land and sea. This legislation is constantly changing related to scientific knowledge and increasing the implementation frameworks. Also, the people become more sensitive to emissions that have a negative attitude towards dredging in the neighborhood. In addition, <b>dredging</b> <b>techniques</b> give rise to objections, which eventually led to think in more environmentally-friendly production methods. After that, the use of dredger is the only alternative in some project. The question is what are the true benefits of these techniques and what is the relation between possible improvements and technological potential as well as the costs. Therefore, it is intended to assess mining techniques {{in the context of their}} environmental impact and the costs. There are many systematic approaches which have been used for evaluation and determination of the environmental performances of different <b>dredging</b> equipment, <b>techniques</b> and procedures. Moreover, the new future developments and latest proposals in the dredging industry have been presented. Also, the new proposal to reduce the turbidity and suspended material effect which is the most important environmental impacts during dredging operations has presented. This research work gives a description of underwater mining techniques and different way of evaluating the dredging equipment’s in term of environmental, economic and social aspects. Also, this work presents two different methods of evaluation. The first approach is the statistical analyses method by using the modern Fuzzy evaluation concept. The second slant is a mathematical accounting method by using the information from the Egyptian case study, in order to reach the most environmental-friendly <b>dredging</b> <b>techniques</b> by taking into account the economic and social point of views. The final evaluation showed that the suction and bucket ladder dredger are the best choices. The assessment was made after comparing many parameters such as performance, characteristics, working depth, soil types and project area. Also, this work presents two different new practices for extraction of the underwater placer deposits which occur on the Egyptian Mediterranean coast. The first technique uses floating processing unit in the in situ area, which gets the extracted material and treated it to reduce the transportation costs. The second technique has divided the working area to many stages which make the suction dredger used also for transporting the material into the beach.

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the within-season and the one-year post impacts of drainage-channel maintenance on juvenile salmonid habitat. A reach of Marblehill Creek experienced a “hard ” bank-to-bank dredging with little-to-no utilization of fish habitat mitigation measures. The second treatment reach, in Big Ditch, experienced a “softer ” form of dredging where fish habitat structures, in the form of rip-rap rock weirs, were restored as the dredging was undertaken. The key variables used to determine effects through comparison between the treatments included: 1. an assessment of the relative abundance of juvenile fish using minnow trapping; 2. measurements of angular canopy density (ACD) along the stream channels (a proxy measurement for stream-channel shading); 3. an assessment of thalweg-velocity variability; and 4. the calculation of channel-roughness coefficients. The fish-use comparisons support four important conclusions regarding the juvenile salmonid habitat impacts relating to these dredging activities: 1. unmitigated channel dredging had a severe detrimental effect on the within-season relative abundance of over-summer rearing coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) (up to- 94 %) and coastal cutthroat trout (O. clarki clarki) (up to...|$|R

Hidden data dredging (also called p-hacking) is {{a major contributor to}} this crisis because it substantially increases Type I error resulting in a much larger proportion of false positive findings than the usually expected 5 %. In order to build better intuition to avoid, detect and criticise some typical problems, here I systematically illustrate the large impact of some easy to implement and so, perhaps frequent data <b>dredging</b> <b>techniques</b> on boosting false positive findings. I illustrate several forms of two special cases of data dredging. First, researchers may violate the data collection stopping rules of null hypothesis significance testing by repeatedly checking for statistical significance with various numbers of participants. Second, researchers may group participants post-hoc along potential but unplanned independent grouping variables. The first approach 'hacks' the number of participants in studies, the second approach ‘hacks’ the number of variables in the analysis. I demonstrate the high amount of false positive findings generated by these techniques with data from true null distributions. I also illustrate that it is extremely easy to introduce strong bias into data by very mild selection and re-testing. Similar, usually undocumented data dredging steps can easily lead to having 20 - 50 %, or more false positives...|$|R

Their significance {{is bound to}} increase further, due to increasing coastal zone development, stricter environmental regulation concerning land-won aggregates and increasing demand for beach replenishment material. Marine aggregate (MA) deposits can be differentiated into relict and modern deposits. The former consist of sedimentary material deposited {{in the past and}} under different environmental and sedimentary regimes than those existing presently (e. g. the gravel/ sand deposits of the Pleistocene buried river valleys of the northwestern European shelves). The latter are deposits, which have been formed and controlled by the modern hydro-and sediment dynamic conditions (e. g. the linear sand banks of the southern North Sea).

40|$|Dredging {{has evolved}} into a highly {{sophisticated}} process drawing from some of the latest technology. The methods of navigational dredging range from clamshell buckets to sophisticated hydraulic dredges. More recently, these techniques have evolved into the processes used for environmental dredging applications. High concentrations of certain contaminants in sediments pose human heath and ecological risks. Dredging of contaminated sediment provides a method of removal of these contaminants of concern (COC). One of the most obvious benefits of environmental dredging is the fact the contaminated sediments are permanently removed from the water body. These sediments are typically disposed of in an upland containment facility or landfill. In some cases disposal of contaminates may not be permitted or the costs to transport them to a permitted facility may be very high. Alternate uses for the contaminated sediments may be considered and may help to reduce or eliminate risks. The cost of these alternate treatment and use methods must be evaluated against other permit-able disposal options. Of paramount concern when dredging is the ability of the process to remove the COCs to a level that is below the regulated concentration. Although <b>dredging</b> <b>techniques</b> have been demonstrated to reduce sediment contaminant concentrations, it appears that these techniques can result in residual contamination. This residual contamination {{may be the result of}} re-suspension of contaminates into the water column or sloughing of adjacent materials into the dredged areas. Concern over these residual concentrations may lead to subsequent passes or other means to minimize risk from the residuals. The impacts of the cleanup activity to the surrounding area need to be evaluated regarding the impact of the operation or long-term disturbance of an area. A dredging operation will typically require some sort of sediment dewatering process. After removal of the solids, the associated water may have to be treated before it can be discharged back into the waterway. Because of these facts a dredging operation typically requires onshore support facilities. Construction of these facilities will likely impact the area surrounding the dredged area...|$|R

40|$|China's {{economy is}} growing rapidly. For 1997 an {{economic}} growth of 10. 5 per cent is expected (source: Economic pages of de Volkskrant, December 1996). With the economic growth the demand for new industrial zones and harbour areas arises. To facilitate these demands the port authority of Shanghai faces two major problems: the shortage of free land and the shallow depth of the entrance channel to Shanghai. To counter the first problem, the lack of free land, the Chinese authorities appointed special port planning zones. These areas are strictly reserved for future port development. Unfortunately, the special port planning zone of Shanghai, called Jinshanwei, is located some 100 kilometres {{away from the city}} centre and the existing harbours. This is a very unworkable situation. Therefore new alternative plans have been developed. The first plan involves the reclamation of new land along the south bank of the Yangtze River. On this new land terminals can be built. The new terminals will be separated from the Yangtze river by a dam. Thereby an artificial canal to the sea is recreated. This plan is called the coastal canal option. The second plan involves the conversion of two islands, close to Shanghai, into new port areas. This plan anticipates at the expected great economic burst of the cities upstream along the Yangtze river. The most important function of the new terminals at these island will be providing a cargo transit-hub to the ports upriver. The islands in the mouth of the Yangtze delta are Changxing and Hengsha. In the future the terminals at these island can be linked with an eight kilometre long bridge to the industrial centre of Shanghai; the Pudong area. The second, and most acute, problem of Shanghai's port is the shallow depth of its entrance channel. Currently the depth of the channel is some seven metres below Chart Datum. At spring tide a maximum water depth of eleven metres is available. These depths are far to small for today's modem vessels. Therefore the Chinese, together with Dutch counterparts, conducted intensive research to the deepening of the entrance channel. The research showed that a combination of river training dams and dredging works will provide the opportunity to deepen the channel from CD- 7. oo metre to CD- 12. 50 metre. With aid of a newly developed entrance channel dredging simulation model the dredging of the entrance channel has been simulated. Five large 15000 m) trailing suction hopper dredgers can bring the channel to its desired depth in some 3. 5 years. Thereby taking in account limiting conditions such as waves, gales and typhoons. Currently new <b>dredging</b> <b>techniques</b> are under development and made commercially available. One of these dredging methods is called water injection dredging (WlD). As combination of conventional trailing suction hopper dredgers and water injection dredgers could be the ideal solution for the dredging operations within Shanghai. Soil and seabed conditions are very favourable for WlD. This requires further research. The entrance channel dredging simulation model can be expanded with a module, representing the process of a water injection dredger. New simulation runs and evaluations should provide the answer whether a combination of these dredgers lives up to its high expectations. Perhaps this is the solution to Shanghai's entrance channel problems. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Contaminated {{granular}} wastes {{are potentially}} reusable {{because they have}} similar {{physical and chemical properties}} as primary raw building materials. From environmental aspects, the reuse must not result in polluting the soil, groundwater and surface water. Therefore the leaching values of inorganic components such as heavy metals and the composition of organics must be under certain limits. From technical aspects, the physical properties must meet the technical requirements of the intended application. Both of environmental contaminants and technical pollutants must be removed or reduced. The main aims of quality improvement are to reduce leaching values and to increase the reusability of materials. For this purpose, the selection of suitable separation and cleansing techniques is important. Effective techniques guarantee the liberation of materials, by which, the useful materials and contaminants are broken apart from each other. Any difference in physical properties of individual components, like size, shape, density, magnetism, surface wettability, electrical conductivity and colour, can be used as the basis for separation of materials.

Methods: Regulations and direct costs for the {{management of}} dredged material are well known, and are strong drivers for decision making, but the importance of indirect costs and ensuing benefits are now recognized although they have generally received less attention to date. Is the perception of dredged sediment reuse options by European stakeholders different in North Western Europe countries? How to strengthen indicators for a sustainable reuse of dredged material? How to help stakeholders to take decisions for dredged material reuse? What is the global impact in terms of economics and the environment for dredged material reuse options? In this context, the CEAMaS Interreg IVB project has taken a multidisciplinary approach involving eight partners from Belgium, France, Ireland and the Netherlands in collaborative research and development to produce analyses and decision tools to support and facilitate stakeholders in strengthening reuse options.

The {{stock of}} the Mid-Atlantic Bight sea scallop fishery is {{assessed}} every year {{through the use of}} various <b>dredging</b> and imaging <b>techniques.</b> The sustainability of the fishery depends on the proper setting of the yearly catch limits based on the assessment of the preceding year. Within the past 10 years, digital image surveys have been explored as a potential method to supplement the yearly dredged based surveys. AUVs {{have been shown to be}} a successful platform for rapidly and accurately performing seafloor image surveys of benthic habitats. In 2011, a Teledyne-Gavia autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with a hull-mounted camera was used to non-invasively optically and acoustically image 313 km of the seafloor within the Mid-Atlantic Bight at a constant altitude of 2 m. Survey transects were completed at 24 open access ground locations and 3 additional locations within the Elephant Trunk Access Area. Trained image analysts, using a scallop counting and sizing algorithm developed for this stock assessment, were able to enumerate and size sea scallops within the collected 250, 000 seafloor images, finding that the region had an overall scallop density of 0. 027 scallops/m 2. Georeferenced data was tagged by the AUV inertial navigation system (INS) to every seafloor image, allowing for unprecedented meter scale spatial analysis of the sea scallop distribution. The relationship between image subsampling and the accuracy of the resulting scallop density was explored via simulations run on the image analysis results. Eight AUV transects were resurveyed by a New Bedford commercial scallop dredge for shell height calibration data and to calculate the harvest efficiency of the dredge (0. 60). Image analysis and backscatter data collected by the AUV’s 900 kHz side-scan sonar were used to classify seafloor substrate types. The surveyed scallop strata were classified as 98. 6 % sandy seafloor with the remaining 1. 4 % representing intermittent shell hash, mounds, and ripples. The side-scan backscatter data revealed other varied seafloor texture, including escarpments from scallop dredge trawling and wave created sorted bedforms. Seafloor dredge scar area measured from the side-scan backscatter data and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) vessel monitoring system (VMS) tracking data were used as a proxy for fishing effort.

Furthermore, the artificial perturbation generated by the berm installation provides a unique opportunity to understand the equilibrium process of coastal morphodynamics.

The dredged material was placed approximately 600 ft offshore of Fort Myers Beach and 1. 5 miles southeast of Matanzas Pass, {{in the form of}} an artificial berm. Time-series surveys and sediment sampling were conducted semi-annually in order to quantify sedimentological characteristics and morphological changes within the first year after construction of the berm. The artificial berm at Fort Myers Beach is composed mainly of fine sand. Patches of mud were found throughout the study area, with the highest concentrations being in the trough landward of the berm, and offshore southeast of the berm area. The highest concentration of carbonates was found in the swash zone, as well as at the landward toe of the berm, which coincides with the coarsest sediment. The overall mud content of the berm is lower than that of the dredged sediment, thus indicating a coarsening of the berm over time. The reduction in fines as compared to the original dredged sedimet could also indicate a selective transport mechanism that moves finer material offshore, and coarser material landward, a desirable trend for artificial berm nourishment. During the course of the first year, the berm migrated landward and increased in elevation. Onshore migration occurred mostly within the first 6 months. Along with onshore migration, the shape of the berm changed from a symmetrical bell curve to an asymmetrical shape with a steep landward slope. There is no clear spatial trend of volume change alongshore within the berm area, indicating that sediment transport is mostly cross-shore dominated. A salient was formed landward of the northern portion of the berm. Several gaps were created during berm construction due to <b>dredging</b> and placement <b>techniques.</b> These dynamic gaps are likely maintained by rip currents through them. This study showed that the Fort Myers Beach berm is active, due to its landward migration during the first year after construction...|$|R
