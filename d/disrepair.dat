5|$|When British troops left Malta in 1979, {{the fort}} was {{abandoned}} {{and fell into}} a state of <b>disrepair.</b> Parts of it were also vandalized. At some point it was also used as a desalination plant.|$|E
5|$|After being decommissioned, Fort Manoel was {{abandoned}} {{and fell into}} a state of <b>disrepair.</b> Parts of it were also vandalized. In 1970, the Royal Malta Yacht Club acquired part of the fort as its club house, and the yacht club remained there until it acquired new premises in Ta' Xbiex in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Although {{repairs to}} the chapel were {{carried out by the}} last Baron Hylton and the {{successive}} owners in the 19th century, it fell into <b>disrepair</b> until, like the castle, it was taken over by the state in 1950.|$|E
5|$|As {{in much of}} the UK, Leeds' {{housing stock}} had fallen into <b>disrepair</b> {{by the middle of the}} 20th century. The city was overcrowded, and the Victorian {{terraces}} were unsuitable for modern inhabitation. Leeds had one of the most Labour orientated councils and in the 1930s pledged to replace 30,000 slums.|$|E
5|$|In 1812, Bishop Winnington Ingram School was {{established}} by the vestry of St Martin's church in Eastcote Road. The school had 111 pupils by 1845 but fell {{into a state of}} <b>disrepair</b> until it was rebuilt in 1931.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, a fire {{destroyed}} the acrylic outer skin of Buckminster Fuller's dome, {{and the previous}} year the Ontario pavilion was lost due to a major fire. With the site falling into <b>disrepair,</b> and several pavilions left abandoned and vandalized, it began to resemble ruins of a futuristic city.|$|E
5|$|Only the {{foundation}} {{remains of the}} property's windmill. What is left, ten rows of stone above the ground, is completely invisible when the home is viewed by passers-by on Lincoln Highway. The windmill started to fall into <b>disrepair</b> around the 1930s or 40s. The original, specific use of the windmill is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Rendered {{unusable}} due to {{a bombing}} by the Italians on 5 July 1915, the ruins remained {{in a state of}} <b>disrepair</b> until the advent of the 21st century, when it was restored by the local administration of Ampezzo, {{with the assistance of the}} Lacedelli family. The fort houses a museum containing relics related to the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Ross {{hotel was}} created by Agustín Ross in 1885, and {{originally}} named Great Hotel Pichilemu (Gran Hotel Pichilemu). It {{is one of the}} oldest hotels in Chile. Although it is still partially open to guests, it is in a state of <b>disrepair.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Gardiner {{section was}} in such a state of <b>disrepair</b> in 2004 that the Wallkill Valley Land Trust almost closed it. Gardiner {{received}} a $100,000 grant from the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation in December 2006, and the purchase was completed in 2007. The state provided an additional $5,000 to maintain the trail.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} wooden structure {{had fallen}} into <b>disrepair</b> by 1978 {{and was replaced by}} the present brick building. The Brudenell Social Club reopened on 30 November 1978, with an official opening taking place on 7 December.|$|E
5|$|The {{town was}} later given {{defensive}} walls, {{probably in the}} 3rd century. After the failure of Roman authority {{in the first decade}} of the 5th century, the baths fell into <b>disrepair</b> and were eventually lost as a result of rising water levels and silting.|$|E
5|$|There was cinema in Northallerton from 1939 until 1995. The Lyric, in the High Street, {{opened in}} October 1939 and {{also served as}} a theatre, with a {{capacity}} of 1,000 seats. It fell into <b>disrepair</b> and eventually closed in June 1995. The building was then bought by the New Life Baptist Church and converted to a place of worship.|$|E
5|$|Zahir and {{his family}} built fortresses, watchtowers, warehouses, and khans (caravanserais). These {{buildings}} improved the domestic administration and general security of Galilee. Today, many of these structures {{are in a state}} of <b>disrepair</b> and remain outside the scope of Israel's cultural preservation laws.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Agrippa in 12BC, a {{solution}} had {{to be found in}} maintaining Rome's water supply system. This came about because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile, and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his own expense. In that year, Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Rome's aqueducts did not fall into <b>disrepair.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the {{property}} was sold in 1960, the garden fell into <b>disrepair,</b> but with {{the purchase of the}} Barnett building, plans were made to restore it using historical photographs. The restoration to the original layout was completed in 2013. In its prime, the garden's centerpiece was a neoclassical bronze statue of Mercury by an unknown artist. The statue was given away in the 1960s, but it was donated back to the museum around 2013, to be displayed in the restored garden.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some work}} was done to {{strengthen}} the structure in the 1960s, the complex was allowed to fall into <b>disrepair.</b> Also during the 1960s, some sections of the complex began to be left unoccupied and others burned down including an engine block. During this period, parts of the complex were used for light industrial use before they too fell into disuse. In the 1990s, the buildings fell victim to vandalism and arson that threatened to destroy {{what remained of the}} site.|$|E
5|$|Brownsea Castle was {{purchased}} by Mary Bonham-Christie in 1927. She allowed the property to fall into <b>disrepair</b> {{and by the time}} of her death in 1961 it was in a very poor condition. It was then purchased by the National Trust and leased to the John Lewis Partnership, who restored it over many years. In the 21st century it is still used by the Partnership as a corporate hotel for their employees and retired staff.|$|E
5|$|Building of {{the palace}} started around 1210 by Bishops Jocelin of Wells and Reginald Fitz Jocelin. The chapel and great hall were added by Bishop Robert Burnell between 1275 and 1292. The walls, {{gatehouse}} and moat were added in the 14th century by Bishop Ralph of Shrewsbury. The Bishops House was added in the 15th century by Bishop Thomas Beckington. The great hall later fell into <b>disrepair</b> and was partially demolished around 1830.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, the O Street Market had once more become dilapidated. The {{structure}} fell into <b>disrepair,</b> trash collected around the building, many vendors were squatters without leases, {{and drug dealers}} and gang members loitered nearby, driving customers away. The building's owner fell behind on tax payments, and the city threatened to place a lien on the building and foreclose.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} World War II was over, the houses on Milwaukee Avenue were falling into <b>disrepair.</b> They had been {{neglected}} throughout the Great Depression and wartime. In 1959, the City of Minneapolis presented {{a plan for}} the Seward neighborhood, which listed the houses on Milwaukee Avenue in 'deteriorated' condition, meaning they had no indoor plumbing or were severely battered.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the fortifications {{had fallen}} into <b>disrepair</b> because the Swedish command did not pay much {{attention}} to these territories, and funds that were allotted for renovation were insignificant. In addition, the forts at Nöteborg and Nyenskans were considered sufficient to provide defense for the region. In 1702, however, some repairs were completed under the supervision of Captain L. Stobecks.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the mosque}} began under the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in either 1634 or 1635, and was {{completed}} in approximately seven years. In the late 1880s, John Lockwood Kipling, father of Rudyard Kipling, wrote about the mosque and its decorative elements in the former Journal of Indian Art. The British scholar Fred Henry Andrews noted in 1903 that the mosque had fallen into <b>disrepair.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 2nd century, {{at least}} part of the Legio XX Valeria Victrix took part in the {{construction}} of Hadrian's Wall, leading to some sections of the fortress being abandoned and others being allowed to fall into <b>disrepair.</b> The Legio XX Valeria Victrix probably went on campaign in 196 under Decimus Clodius Albinus into Gaul, leaving Deva under-garrisoned. They would have suffered heavy losses in Gaul before returning to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Few visible {{signs of}} the company remain. The former extent of the Bolckow, Vaughan {{property}} at the Eston Sheet and Galvanizing Works beside the River Tees Dockyard is still marked by boundary stones on Smiths Dock Road, Middlesbrough. The graves {{of the founding fathers}} of the company and of Middlesbrough, Henry Bolckow and John Vaughan, in St Cuthbert's Churchyard, Marton, were neglected for the whole of the 20th century, and fell into <b>disrepair.</b> The neglect was recognised and the graves refurbished in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Fort Stanwix {{occupied}} a strategic western portage {{known as the}} Oneida Carrying Place (site of modern Rome, New York) between the Mohawk River, which flowed southeast to the Hudson River, and Wood Creek, whose waters ultimately led to Lake Ontario. Built by the British in 1758 during the French and Indian War on the only dry ground in the area, the fort had fallen into <b>disrepair.</b> When the American Revolutionary War widened in 1776 to include the frontier areas between New York and the Province of Quebec, the site again became strategically important.|$|E
5|$|Having fallen {{somewhat}} into <b>disrepair,</b> {{the structure}} {{came under the}} care of the Banagher Branch of the Offaly Historical Society in the 1980s and considerable restoration work has been undertaken since then. The Canal Bank on which it stands, is the property of the people of Banagher and is held in trust as a public amenity. Considerable works around the castle have also taken place and the castle, park and riverside walk are open to the public.|$|E
5|$|In 1711, by {{the order}} of then-Governor of Kiev, the route between the Zamkova and Andriyivskyy {{mountains}} were expanded, thus allowing traffic to become more suitable for horses and wagon carriages. The Andriyivskyy Descent was renamed in 1920 in honor of young revolutionary Georgiy Liver. In 1944, {{it was decided to}} return the street to its prior name; in 1957, the street was renamed back to Andreevsky Spusk—the Russian variant of Andriyivskyy Descent. In the 1980s, the Andriyivskyy Descent received a thorough reconstruction after years of <b>disrepair.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1875, the U.S. Department of the Interior was {{in serious}} <b>disrepair</b> due to {{corruption}} and incompetence. Interior Secretary Columbus Delano, discovered {{to have taken}} bribes for fraudulent land grants, {{was forced to resign}} from office on October 15, 1875. Delano had also given lucrative cartographical contracts to his son John Delano and Ulysses S. Grant's own brother, Orvil Grant. Neither John Delano nor Orvil Grant performed any work, nor were they qualified to hold such surveying positions.|$|E
5|$|In late April, {{leading a}} fleet of seven ships and over 700, Phips sailed from Boston to the Acadian capital, Port Royal. On May 9 he summoned {{governor}} Louis-Alexandre des Friches de Meneval to surrender. Meneval, in command of about 70 men and a fort in <b>disrepair,</b> promptly negotiated terms of capitulation. When Phips came ashore the next day, {{it was discovered that}} Acadians had been removing valuables, including some that were government property (and thus were supposed to come under the victor's control).|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, {{the line}} lay unused and in <b>disrepair,</b> but the riveted-steel {{elevated}} structure was structurally sound. Around this time, the structure became known {{to a few}} urban explorers and local residents for the tough, drought-tolerant wild grasses, shrubs, and rugged trees such as sumac that had sprung up in the gravel along the abandoned railway. It was slated for demolition under the administration of then-mayor Rudy Giuliani.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, the battle site attracted fewer visitors {{and fell into}} <b>disrepair.</b> It was later {{taken over by the}} Tippecanoe County Historical Association, which now maintains the battleground and the seminary building, housing a museum about the battle. They added an amphitheater to the memorial in 1986. In 1989–90, the amphitheater was used for performances of The Battle of Tippecanoe Outdoor Drama.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages {{the area was}} a farm, growing to a wealthy estate that fell into <b>disrepair</b> towards 1900. It was bought in 1919 by Scout Commissioner William de Bois Maclaren and given to The Scout Association of the United Kingdom to provide camping to London Scouts, and {{training}} for Scouters. As Scout Leaders from all {{countries of the world}} have come to Gilwell Park for their Wood Badge training, {{it is one of the}} landmarks of the world Scouting movement.|$|E
5|$|It is {{recorded}} in Domesday that a priest was resident in Ashby, {{and that the}} church dedicated to St Helen consisted only of a nave. In about 1144, Philip Beaumais, lord of the Manor of Ashby, granted the church, its lands and revenues to the Augustinian community of Lilleshall Abbey, which retained possession until 1538. A 2013 excavation found evidence of a two-storey vicarage dating from this period, but the building fell into <b>disrepair</b> following the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the site was cleared in the English Civil War of 1642–49.|$|E
5|$|King Caesar’s grandchildren, {{the sons}} and daughters of Gershom B. Weston, then {{inherited}} the house which by that time was in <b>disrepair.</b> They soon sold it to Frederick Bradford Knapp, former Superintendent of Buildings at Harvard College, in 1886. Knapp established the Powder Point School for Boys, a preparatory school, and converted Ezra Weston’s farm into athletic fields and the outbuildings into classrooms and gymnasiums. The King Caesar House was designated as the headmaster's house. The Powder Point School for Boys ceased operation in 1926 and the Knapp family sold the property in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the holiday}} homes were never {{designed}} for long-term residence and {{are now in a}} state of <b>disrepair.</b> According to the Index of Multiple Deprivation of both 2010 and 2015, the eastern half of the village is the most deprived area of England. Jaywick has significant problems with unemployment and is at risk of flooding, despite several attempts by the local council and government to transform the area.|$|E
