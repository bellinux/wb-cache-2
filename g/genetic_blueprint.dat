40|$|Abstract: For {{more than}} half a century, child {{development}} has endured as one of the main components of teacher education. But if children do develop, as developmentalists claim, what precisely is it that develops and how? Traditionally, within education, answers to these questions have drawn heavily on the theories of Jean Piaget and Lev Vygotsky. Piaget advocated the progressive development of reasoning through identifiable linear phases or stages. Vygotsky emphasised the role of cultural mediation, whereby the child internalises the habits of mind of his/her social group. More generally within cognitive psychology, development has been attributed to the interaction of two distinct causes- nature and nurture- and the developmental process has been viewed as being linear, progressive, and incremental, guided by some inner mechanism of design; by schemas or <b>genetic</b> <b>blueprints</b> acting as programs in the mind. According to the Dynamic Systems Approach (DSA), however, there are no programs or blueprints and no teleological design. Instead, human development is the results of non-linear emergent self-organisation; a holistic process that rejects the dualisms of nature/nurture, perception/cognition and mind/brain associated with traditional theory. This very different account of development calls for a reconceptualisation of child development theory in teacher education. Our paper attempts to move some way in that direction...|$|R

The Colonists eventually returned to Earth in 1947 when one of their ships crashed in New Mexico due to exposure to magnetite in the surrounding rocks. Shortly after this event, a select few power brokers, mainly in the United States and the Soviet Union (though some also came from other nations), first learned of the Colonist plot to retake the planet.

Targeting of gene delivery {{is essential to}} achieve specificity for the intended tissue, which is especially critical in cancer gene therapy to avoid destruction of healthy tissue. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is considered the safest viral vector and, compared to non-viral vectors, offers several advantages: higher efficiency, genetic modification, combinatorial panning, and high monodispersity. Classic viral targeting has focused on engineering ligand-receptor interactions, but many cell surface targets do not support post-binding transduction events. Furthermore, many potential target tissues – such as triple negative breast cancer – may not display a single, unique identifying surface receptor, so new methods of targeting are needed. Alternatively, many pathological states, including most cancers, exhibit upregulation of proteolytic enzymes in the extracellular milieu. The present work describes {{the development of an}} AAV platform that has been engineered to activate in response to disease-related proteases. The specificity and sensitivity of these protease-activatable viruses (PAVs) can be tuned {{to meet the demands of}} various clinical scenarios, giving the platform some therapeutic versatility.

40|$|In {{microbial}} ecology, high-resolution molecular {{approaches are}} essential to characterize the vast organismal and functional diversity and to understand the interactions between environmental factors and microbial communities (MCs). Molecular eco-systems biology based on the integration of genomics and functional omics, allows conclusive links to be drawn between genetic potential and function. However, the field faced major challenges arising from the heterogeneity and dynamics of MCs. Hence, to facilitate meaningful data integration, analysis and modeling, {{it is crucial to}} obtain standardised, reproducible and simultaneous measurements of multiple features from a unique sample. We have developed a new methodological framework for the isolation of high-quality DNA, large and small RNA, proteins and metabolites fractions from undivided MC samples. The methodology is based on cryogenic sample preservation and cell lysis. Metabolites are first extracted using organic solvents, followed by sequential isolation of biomacromolecules using chromatographic spin column technology. The methodology was validated by comparison to commonly used dedicated methods and its broad applicability was demonstrated on MCs of biotechnological, environmental and medical interest. Applying this method to sewage plant MCs has allowed us to determine community-level keystone genes and to probe the functional relevance of the population-level composite genomes, leading to the identification of key players of the community. This methodological framework lays the foundation for standardized molecular eco-systems biology and offers exciting prospects for elucidating the <b>genetic</b> <b>blueprints</b> and the functional relevance of specific populations within MCs, particularly in relation to environment-driven demography changes leading to catastrophic bifurcations...|$|R

As {{the study of}} microbes {{and their impact on}} the environment grows, so too does the desire to understand the genetic basis of the physiologies that make possible interactions between microbial cells and their environment. Since it is now much more cost-effective to sequence bacterial genomes, environmental metagenomic assembly is a very attractive option for obtaining the <b>genetic</b> <b>blueprints</b> of bacterial physiologies. Bacteria of the genus Thiomargarita (Greek; theio-: sulfur; margarites: pearl), pose a particularly interesting quandary. The genus includes the world's largest bacteria, but as uncultured organisms, their physiologies and basis for their gigantism are not well understood. In order to investigate the genetic basis for these modes, a single cell MDA amplification approach was used on T. nelsonii cells collected at the Hydrate Ridge methane seep off of the coast of Oregon. These particular cells were derived from a gastropod-attached epibiont community. Next-generation sequencing produced a metagenomic product representing both T. nelsonii and attached bacteria (epibionts). These reads were assembled into contigs, binned using the tetranucleotide frequency of the resultant contigs, and finalized using a more stringent secondary assembly. The resulting draft genome shows evidence in Thiomargarita nelsonii for a complete denitrification pathway not previously known in large, vacuolated, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Additionally, the genes necessary for polyphosphate metabolism were observed. Polyphosphate metabolism is thought {{to play a role in}} the formation of phosphatic minerals that serve as important reservoirs in the marine phosphorous cycle...|$|R

40|$|It {{is likely}} that more words {{have been written about}} human {{sexuality}} than any other topic, {{with the possible exception of}} human death. Indeed, the two experiences are combined in a characteristic French phrase, le petit mort. In the book under review, Janet Shibley Hyde, a professor of psychology and women's studies at the University of Wisconsin— Madison, has edited seven chapters reviewing the psychobiology of human sexuality. These well-written contributions range from an introduction to the relationship between contemporary neuroscience and research on sex to a concluding chapter forecasting future directions and prospects for the field. What sets this book apart from related texts is its emphasis on the biological basis of human sexuality. In Chapter 1, Hyde convincingly argues that “an explosion of neuroscience research on sexuality ” (p. 3) has been driven by pharmacological and technological advances. It is also likely that the pace of studies on human sexuality has been driven by basic science (e. g., Craig, Harper, & Loat, 2004; Lim et al., 2004). Hyde justifies her focus on the biological substrates of human sexuality by highlighting the “tremendous amount ” (p. 3) of information about these processes that has been learned in the past 10 years. However, her use of the term <b>genetic</b> <b>blueprints</b> to characterize one level of substrate is unfortunate given our current understanding of genes as dynamic, modifiable, capable of being immobilized, and, possibly, subordinate to environmental induction in some conditions.

40|$|Now that a draft {{sequence}} {{of the human genome}} is nearly complete, questions regarding both the information contained within our <b>genetic</b> <b>blueprints</b> as well as the manner in which that information content changes over time can be addressed in ways that had not previously been possible. By their very nature, some of the nucleotide sequences present within our genome allow detailed examination of the mode and pattern of evolution that has shaped our genetic instructions over time spans of tens of millions of years. Alu repeats are one example. Using these relatively short, ubiquitous DNA sequences we explore the problem of attempting to predict the relative abundance of a variety of different possible substitution events that have accumulated over the past 20 million years. To perform well when applied to biological sequence data, computational methods must have the ability to tolerate both natural variation in the data and noise introduced in data measurement. As a result and due to their ability to search complex, noisy search spaces, Evolutionary computation techniques are particularly promising for the analysis of nucleotide sequence data and other biological data sets. We have used these techniques to address a key question in understanding the process of evolution: the effect of genomic context on substitutions (the degree to which the genomic information surrounding a particular region of a chromosome affects the changes to that region over time). We utilized genetic programming to predict changes in these DNA sequences over time. These approaches reveal that a significant proportion of DNA nucleotide substitutions within a given region are governed by a model that takes into consideration only the GC-content of the DNA sequences surrounding the region being considered...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Despite {{several decades}} of criticism, dichotomous {{thinking}} about behavioral development (the {{view that the}} behavioral phenotype can be partitioned into inherited and acquired components) remains widespread and influential. This is particularly true in study of birdsong development, where {{it has become increasingly}} common to diagnose songs, elements of songs, or precursors of songs (song templates) as either innate or learned on the basis of isolation-rearing experiments. The theory of sensory templates has encouraged both the dichotomous approach (by providing a role for <b>genetic</b> <b>blueprints</b> to guide song learning) and an emphasis on structural rather than functional aspects of song development. As a result, potentially important lines of investigation have been overlooked and the interpretation of existing data is often flawed. Evidence for a genetic origin of behavioral differences is frequently interpreted as evidence for the genetic determination of behavioral characters. The technique of isolation rearing remains the methodology of choice for many investigators, {{despite the fact that it}} offers only a rather crude analysis of the contribution of experience to song development and provides no information at all about genetic contributions to development. The latter could in principle be elucidated by the application of developmental-genetic techniques, but it is unlikely that these can easily be applied to the study of birdsong. Because developmental questions are so often posed in terms of the learned—innate dichotomy, "experience" istaken to be synonymous with "learning " and the possible role of nonobvious contributions to song development has largely been ignored. An alternative approach, based on Daniel Lehrman's interactionist theory of development, permits a more thorough appreciation of the problems that have yet to be addressed, and provides a more secure conceptual foundation for theories of song development...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{appropriate}} {{function of}} the nervous system relies on precise patterns of connectivity among hundreds to billions of neurons across different biological systems. Evolutionarily conserved patterns of neural circuit organization and connectivity between morphologically and functionally diverse sets of neurons emerge from a remarkably robust set of <b>genetic</b> <b>blueprints,</b> uniquely defining circuits responsible for planning and execution of behavioral repertoires (Arenkiel et al., 2004; Dasen, 2009; Pecho-Vrieseling et al., 2009; Sürmeli et al., 2011; White and Sillitoe, 2013; Inamata and Shirasaki, 2014). Although it is well-established that individual neurons represent the elemental building blocks of the brain, understanding the architecture of neural circuits and how neurons functionally “wire up” through synapses, remains one of biology's major challenges. Our current understanding of how interconnected neuronal populations produce perception, memory, and behavior remains nascent. To unravel the details of complex nervous system function, we must consider not only the morphological and physiological properties of individual neurons, but also the structure and function of connections formed between different cell types. In the last decade much effort has been focused on trying to fully characterize “the brain connectome” and to understand how patterns of synaptic connectivity between neurons might help to better inform the underlying defects associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders (Sporns et al., 2005; Lichtman and Sanes, 2008). More recently there is a growing interest in mapping, and eventually classifying, all synapses in the brain to construct a complete “synaptome” (DeFelipe, 2010; O'Rourke et al., 2012). The very nature of these studies, which rely on multidisciplinary research efforts, have thus catalyzed the development of new research tools and technologies. For instance, advances in molecular genetics, viral engineering, and imaging technologies now allow precise labeling, manipulation, and mapping of complex neural circuits, together revealing previously unattainable details about the cellular morphologies and subcellular structures that are unique to the different types of neurons that make up the brain. Such technological advances could not be possible without successful co-evolution of novel computational tools and analytical methods that allow acquisition, management, and interpretation of gigantic and complex datasets. In fact, this last point perhaps represents the main challenge for the future of “connectomics” (Lichtman et al., 2014) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} diversity {{found in}} plants {{has served as}} a major source of inspiration to many synthetic and biological chemists. Nature has evolved enzyme active sites to catalyze the synthesis of structurally complex compounds that serve as pharmaceuticals, insecticides, dyes, perfumes, and biofuels. In Catharanthus roseus, approximately 130 structurally complex monoterpene indole alkaloids are produced, including the clinically used anti-mitotic drugs, vinblastine and vincristine. The common intermediate to all monoterpene indole alkaloids is strictosidine, the product of an asymmetric Pictet- Spengler condensation of tryptamine and the iridoid monoterpene secologanin. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme strictosidine synthase. This thesis describes the use of kinetic isotope effects, the rate dependence on pH, as well as structural and computational data to propose a mechanism by which strictosidine synthase catalyzes the Pictet-Spengler reaction. Notably, the data also shed light on the mechanism of the widely used nonenzymatic reaction. Interestingly, the Pictet-Spenglerase strictosidine synthase belongs to a superfamily of enzymes that have mainly been observed to catalyze ester hydrolysis. Using the [beta]-propeller fold conserved in both strictosidine synthase and the related hydrolase, paraoxonase, rational mutagenesis was used to convert strictosidine synthase into a hydrolase. Intriguingly, during the rational design process, the function of a closely related strictosidine synthase homolog was also functionally characterized as a hydrolase. In addition to reengineering proteins with new catalytic activity, the chemical diversity in plants can also modified using metabolic engineering. However, this approach requires knowledge of the <b>genetic</b> <b>blueprints</b> of the plant to be known. Using the recently released C. roseus transcriptome sequencing data along with co-expression analysis, this thesis describes the functional characterization of a new P 450 gene involved in metabolizing a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of bioactive bisindole alkaloids. With the functional characterization of this new gene, a combination of gene silencing and synthetic biology techniques will provide a greater understanding on how to "tune" alkaloid biosynthesis in C. roseus in order to generate more functionally diverse molecules. by Lesley-Ann Giddings.

40|$|Biological {{wastewater}} treatment {{is arguably the}} most widely used biotechnological process on Earth. Wastewater also represents a valuable energy commodity that is currently not being harnessed comprehensively. Mixed microbial communities that naturally occur at the air-water interface of certain biological {{wastewater treatment}} systems accumulate excess long chain fatty acids intracellularly. This phenotypic trait may potentially be exploited for the transformation of lipid-rich wastewater into biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters). Using a molecular Eco-Systems Biology approach, we are studying which genes contribute to the lipid accumulation phenotype and, thus, overall community function. We first compared the lipid accumulation phenotype to the structure of lipid accumulating communities from a local wastewater treatment plant by coupled deep sequencing of the 16 S rRNA locus, metagenome sequencing and metabolomic analysis of 4 biological replicates sampled at 4 different time points. Based on the results of these analyses and in order to obtain a detailed view of the structure and function of the respective microbial communities, metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, metaproteomic and (meta-) metabolomic analyses were completed for a single representative biological sample of highest interest. In order to facilitate meaningful data integration of this highly heterogeneous consortium, biomolecular fractions used for the omic analyses were extracted from a unique single sample using a recently developed biomolecular isolation protocol. The coupled survey and the comparative metagenomic analysis demonstrate that the communities change significantly from dates with warm water temperatures to cold water temperatures while alpha diversity remains stable. In the winter period, this switch results in a strong enrichment of a bacterial genus well known to accumulate intracellular lipids, namely Microthrix spp., a representative genome of which has recently been sequenced by us. Correlation networks based on microorganism and concomitant intra- and extra-cellular metabolite abundances provides an overview of organisms potentially involved in the community-wide lipid accumulating phenotype. A sample with the highest abundance of Microthrix spp. was subsequently chosen {{for the construction of a}} community-wide metabolic model using metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, metaproteomic and (meta-) metabolomics data. Based on these omic datasets, expressed enzyme variants linked to the lipid accumulation phenotype have been identified and are currently undergoing in vitro characterization. Meta-omic analyses offer exciting prospects for elucidating the <b>genetic</b> <b>blueprints</b> and the functional relevance of specific populations within microbial communities. Consequently, connecting the overall community phenotype to specific genotypes will allow much needed fundamental ecological understanding of microbial community and population dynamics, particularly in relation to environment-driven demography changes leading to tipping points and catastrophic bifurcations...|$|R

Newmeyer (1998) instead views the lack of symmetry, irregularity and idiosyncrasy that universal grammar tolerates and the widely different principles of organization of its various sub-components and consequent wide variety of linking rules relating them as evidence that such design features do not qualify as an exaptation.

However, it is not known how the newly synthesized polypeptide chains fold into a protein with specific function. It was not until 1973 that Anfinsen [1] postulated that all the information needed for a protein to correctly fold into its native structure is encoded solely in its amino acid sequence and that the native state of the protein is the conformation with the lowest energy. Consequently, this important principle has brought immense interests among the scientists to investigate how proteins fold into their native structures and eventually determine the correct functional fold for the proteins. The two most mature and conventional experimental techniques to solve the structure of a protein are the X-ray crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). John Kendrew and Max Perutz shared the Nobel Prize in 1962 for their pioneering achievement in solving the atomic level structure of the protein myoglobin and hemoglobin, respectively, using X-ray diffraction. Since then, many protein structures were solved and various roles of proteins in living cells were known. Despite the accuracy and the advances of these experimental techniques, such methods are very costly and it may take months to years for solving one structure. The current number of 3 D protein structures is very small compared to the number of protein sequences, creating a huge gap between them. It has become more pressing with the growth of genome sequencing projects providing protein sequences for which structural information is not available. As this gap is expected to keep on growing with the ongoing genome projects, the experimental techniques certainly cannot be expected to keep pace with the rapid flow of the sequences. This has caused an urgent need to accurately predict the 3 D structure of proteins from the linear chain of amino acid sequence using other methods especially computational work that relies heavily on theoretical studies. However, despite decades of active research and the impressive advances [2, 3, 4, 5], computational protein structure prediction and protein folding remain one of the most important unsolved problems in structural biology today [6, 7, 8]...|$|R
40|$|Native seed {{needs to}} be sourced locally yet contain ample <b>genetic</b> variation. A <b>blueprint</b> is {{developed}} for assembling and assessing native plant material at one eco-geographical site prior to seed multiplication for restoring degraded drylands of North Africa. To satisfy the 'local yet ample' criterion, the feasibility of selecting {{a limited number of}} high-yielding genotypes within one starter collection of Cenchrus ciliaris L. in Presaharian Tunisia (100 - 200 mm annual rainfall) was tested and compared to outcomes with similar work on its ecological complement, Stipa lagascae R. & Sch. Results showed that a limited number of high-yielding genotypes can easily produce quality native seed because of the high genetic diversity of the starter material. Results also showed that there was a high potential to increase the rain-use efficiency of degraded drylands using this seed. Seven ground rules are suggested when building the starter collection: (i) carefully delimit the region for sourcing seed; (ii) work with individual plants; (iii) carefully choose the collection site; (iv) replicate plant material as much as is feasible; (v) match evaluation methods to resource constraints; (vi) wait for conditions of maximum resource availability before culling; and (vii) apply a two-tiered selection strategy. © 2008 The Authors.
