50|$|Slowing {{stream bed}} erosion by taking {{advantage}} of a thalweg helps stabilize running water sources. Placing boulders along the thalweg in a running water source helps to protect the channel's sedimentary erosion and <b>deposit</b> <b>balance.</b> In concurrence with the placement of boulders along a thalweg, the placement of boulders along an instream to form man-made sills also helps to slow the sedimentary erosion and deposit of running water sources, while keeping the esteem (fishing, local wildlife, and recreation) and natural resources of the running water source intact. The placement of boulders along a thalweg and the creation of instream sills help to aid the flow of water during late summer months when the flow rate drops, and helps to slow sedimentary erosion and deposit in the spring and fall months when the flow rates are high. This process of utilizing a thalweg to slow stream bed erosion was used in Meacham Creek in Umatilla, Oregon.|$|E

30|$|First, the {{discriminant}} analysis {{results indicate that}} the resilience of the top two most resilient groups, Groups Usurper and Resistant (green and blue areas in Fig.  7) was characterized by high values of the following eight variables: GDP per capita; gross output value of farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery per square kilometer; percentage of population aged 15 – 64; percentage of urban population; resident saving <b>deposit</b> <b>balances</b> per capita; per capita social welfare beds; percentage of population with education of senior secondary school and above; percent of cultivated land; and population density. Counties belonging to the Usurper and Resistant groups were mostly associated with economically developed and highly populated areas such as those in Chengdu City, Mianyang City, and Deyang City. We can interpret that GDP per capita and gross output value of farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery per square kilometer are indicators of the economic state of a county. The state of prequake economic health might have helped in longer-term recovery after the earthquake. Counties with higher percentages of urban population and per capita saving <b>deposit</b> <b>balances</b> might be more resilient, as more wealth can help the county reduce and recover from damage quicker. Higher percentages of population with education of senior secondary school and above and population aged 15 – 64 also characterize a resilient county because they are important in technology innovation and boosting economic vitality, which could promote the resilience of a county.|$|R

Non-pecuniary avoidance efforts included increased offering of convenience features such as large numbers of branch offices and giveaways of consumer goods to new customers.
