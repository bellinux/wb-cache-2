40|$|Abstract — In recent years, {{inspection}} {{has declined}} in importance as {{statistical process control}} has assumed a more prominent role in the quality function. However, product quality inspection is still an important task {{in the production of}} hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> <b>component</b> manufacturing. In the case study company, which produces hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> <b>component,</b> inspection occurs at many points in a process. Inspectors perform 100 % inspection using microscope for many hours without adequate break. After continually monitoring the performance of inspectors, it was found that certain nonconformities were more difficult to find, the number of nonconformities reported was unusual, and inspectors varied in their abilities. Turnover rate of the quality inspection division in this company is high. Therefore, this research aims at determining the impact of working duration and resting time on reducing the mental fatigue in inspection task with microscope in the hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> <b>component</b> manufacturing. Five types of working duration and resting time were studied and compared using Randomized Complete Block Design of Experiment with two replicates. A variety of data collection tools were used to assist in the data collection. The data collection tools used included bipolar questionnaire, reaction time, and critical flicker frequency (CFF). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted. The result showed that, the work-rest period type significantly affects the mental fatigue reduction as measured by questionnaire scores and reaction time. However, the work-rest period type significantly does not affect the mental fatigue reduction as measured by CFF...|$|R

40|$|RAID is a {{data storage}} {{virtualization}} technology that combines multiple <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> <b>components</b> into a logical unit {{for the purpose}} of data redundancy or for the performance improvement. Data is distributed across the drives in several ways which is referred to as RAID levels, depending on the specific level of redundancy and performance requirement. Solid-state drive RAID is a strategy for improving performance that involves dividing and storing the same data on multiple solid state drives. A group of solid-state drives (SSDs) are connected together to create a redundant array of independent disks (RAID). An operating system sees the RAID as one large disk, but since read and write operations are being spread out over multiple disks, inputs/outputs (I/Os) can be carried out simultaneously, so that performance speed can be improved. In this paper we will discusss about various method by which data can be moved to and from other storage devices and how they overcomes the problem that occur when we store data in disk drives...|$|E

40|$|Disk drives {{have been}} around since the 19502 ̆ 7 s. Since their inception, disk drives have {{undergone}} significant improvements and considerable downsizing.

To keep up with this demand and the need for greater disk drive performance, many electronic firms are sourcing OEM drives for their product lines.

With the help of GHI 2 ̆ 7 s Shock Response Spectrum software, several shock signals were created and evaluated against each other in the frequency domain. Various shock signal parameters including pulse width, wave shape, peak or faired acceleration and filtering were compared against each other for effects on input energy.

At present, the trend of using hard disk drives has continuously declined leading to limits in a company’s revenue potential. It is important to improve and develop the production process to create market share and {{to have the ability to}} compete with competitors with a higher value and quality. Therefore, an effective tool is needed to support such matters. In this research, the Arena program was applied to analyze the results both before and after the improvement. Finally, the precedent was used before proceeding with the real process. There were 14 work stations with 35 operators altogether in the RA production process where this study was conducted. In the actual process, the average production time was 84. 03 seconds per product piece (by timing 30 times in each work station) along with a rating assessment by implementing the Westinghouse principles. This process showed that the rating was 123 % underlying an assumption of 5 % allowance time. Consequently, the standard time was 108. 53 seconds per piece. The Takt time was calculated from customer needs divided by working duration in one day; 3. 66 seconds per piece. Of these, the proper number of operators was 30 people. That meant five operators should be eliminated in order to increase the production process. After that, a production model was created from the actual process by using the Arena program to confirm model reliability; the outputs from imitation were compared with the original (actual process) and this comparison indicated that the same output meaning was reliable. Then, worker numbers and their job responsibilities were remodeled into the Arena program.
