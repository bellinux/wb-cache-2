5|$|The {{failure of}} Ibn al-Ash'ath's revolt {{led to the}} {{tightening}} of Umayyad control over Iraq. Al-Hajjaj founded a permanent garrison for the Syrian troops at Wasit, situated between Basra and Kufa, and the Iraqis, regardless of social status, were deprived of any real power in the governance of the region. This was coupled with a reform of the salary (ʿaṭāʾ) system by al-Hajjaj: whereas hitherto the salary had been calculated based {{on the role of}} one's ancestors in the early Muslim conquests, it now became limited to those actively participating in campaigns. As most of the army was now composed of Syrians, this measure gravely injured the interests of the <b>Iraqis,</b> <b>who</b> regarded this as another impious attack on hallowed institutions. In addition, extensive land reclamation and irrigation works were undertaken in lower Iraq (the Sawad), but this was limited mostly to around Wasit, and the proceeds went to the Umayyads and their clients, not the Iraqi nobility. As a result, the political power of the once mighty Kufan élites was soon broken.|$|E

500|$|Nearly {{all members}} of a squad from 2nd Battalion 4th Marines were killed when they drove into an ambush in unarmored Humvees, {{the first time the}} Marines had lost a firefight in Iraq. On 17 April, insurgents {{attacked}} a Marine patrol in the border city of Husaybah, leading to a series of engagements that lasted the whole day and resulted in five Marines and at least 120 insurgents killed. [...] Around the same time, on 14 April, a squad led by Corporal Jason Dunham was operating near Husaybah when one member of a group of <b>Iraqis</b> <b>who</b> were being searched by Dunham's squad threw a grenade at the squad. Dunham immediately threw himself on the grenade, receiving a mortal wound from the blast but saving his fellow squad members. He later became the first Marine since the Vietnam War to be awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E

2500|$|On October 13, 2007, the FBI {{reported}} that it had concluded that at least 14 of the 17 <b>Iraqis</b> <b>who</b> died in the square had been killed without cause. The three justifiable killings were those of the two passengers in the white Kia sedan and an unidentified Iraqi nearby. A Blackwater spokeswoman responded to the findings by saying Blackwater [...] "supports the stringent accountability of the industry. If it is determined that one person was complicit in the wrongdoing, we would support accountability in that. The key people in this have not spoken with investigators." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2008, Iraqi archaeologists {{were able}} to visit the areas {{for the first time}} since the invasion. Later that year, the US military's efforts to restore Dair Mar Elia were {{reported}} in the international media. The journalist James Foley, who was later beheaded by ISIL, wrote that the site was being saved [...] "for future generations of <b>Iraqis</b> <b>who</b> will hopefully soon have the security to appreciate it."

2500|$|An {{article in}} the New York Times {{describes}} [...] "irregularities including millions of reconstruction dollars stuffed casually into footlockers and filing cabinets, an American soldier in the Philippines who gambled away cash belonging to Iraq, and three <b>Iraqis</b> <b>who</b> plunged to their deaths in a rebuilt hospital elevator that had been improperly certified as safe." [...] While the US government has begun the process of prosecuting contractors that stole American tax dollars, the Iraqi government currently has no means of reacquiring Iraqi assets that were stolen by US contractors. This is partially due to a decree passed by the CPA that gives civilian contractors in Iraq immunity from all Iraqi jurisdiction.|$|E

2500|$|Different {{routes and}} {{terminal}} locations on the Mediterranean coast were {{sought by the}} French, who favored a northern route through Syria and Lebanon terminating at the city of Tripoli on the Lebanese coast, and the British and the <b>Iraqis</b> <b>who</b> preferred a southern route, terminating at Haifa, in what then was Palestine. The issue was settled by a compromise which provided {{for the construction of}} two pipelines, each with a throughput capacity of 2,000,000 tons a year. The length of the Northern line would be , that of the Southern line (Mosul-Haifa oil pipeline) [...] In 1934, the pipelines were completed from Kirkuk to Al Hadithah, and from there, to both Tripoli and Haifa; the Kirkuk field was brought online the same year. Only in 1938, nine years after the discovery, did IPC begin to export oil in significant quantities.|$|E
2500|$|Current U.S. {{policy is}} not working, {{as the level of}} {{violence}} in Iraq is rising and the government is not advancing national reconciliation. Making no changes in policy would simply delay the day of reckoning at a high cost. Nearly 100 Americans are dying every month. The United States is spending $2 billion a week. Our ability to respond to other international crises is constrained. A majority of the American people are soured on the war. This level of expense is not sustainable over an extended period, especially when progress is not being made. The longer the United States remains in Iraq without progress, the more resentment will grow among <b>Iraqis</b> <b>who</b> believe they are subjects of a repressive American occupation. As one U.S. official said to us, [...] "Our leaving would make it worse. ... The current approach without modification will not make it better." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 9, 2003, a large {{statue of}} Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square, {{directly}} in front of the Palestine Hotel where the world's journalists had been quartered, was toppled by a U.S. M88 tank recovery vehicle surrounded by dozens of celebrating <b>Iraqis,</b> <b>who</b> had been attempting to pull down the statue earlier with little success. One such futile attempt by sledgehammer wielding weightlifter Kadhem Sharif particularly caught media attention. [...] Eventually the M88 was able to topple the statue which was jumped upon by Iraqi citizens who then decapitated the head of the statue and dragged it through the streets of the city hitting it with their shoes. The destruction of the statue was shown live on cable news networks as it happened and made the front pages of newspapers and covers of magazines all over the world - symbolizing the fall of the Saddam government. The images of the statue falling came as a shock to many Arab viewers, who had thought that Iraq was winning the war.|$|E
