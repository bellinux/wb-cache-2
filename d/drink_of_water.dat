There is a long silence as the two stare at each other before the curtain comes down.|$|E
25|$|Mind in the ToK system {{refers to}} the set of mental {{behaviors}}. Mental behaviors are behaviors of animals mediated by the nervous system that produce a functional effect on the animal-environment relationship. As such, Mind is essentially synonymous with what behavioral psychologists have meant when they use the term behavior. Thus, a fly avoiding a fly swatter, a rat pushing a bar or a human getting a <b>drink</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> are all mental behaviors. Mind is not synonymous with sentience or the capacity for mental experience, although such processes are presumed {{to emerge in the}} mental dimension. Cognition, in the broad sense of the term (i.e., as meaning neuro-information processing) is seen as covert mental behavior, whereas change between the animal and the environment is defined as overt mental behavior. Thus, by defining mind as mental behavior, Henriques argues that the ToK System provides a way to bridge the epistemological differences between cognitive and behavioral science.|$|E

25|$|The {{novel is}} divided into eight books, or parts, {{each with its own}} subchapters. Book one opens with the story of the three Magi, who arrive in Bethlehem to hear the news of Christ’s birth. Readers meet the fictional {{character}} of Judah {{for the first time in}} book two, when his childhood friend Messala, also a fictional character, returns to Jerusalem as an ambitious commanding officer of the Roman legions. The teen-aged boys come to realize that they have changed and hold very different views and aspirations. When a loose tile is accidentally dislodged from the roof of Judah's house during a military parade and strikes the Roman governor, knocking him from his horse, Messala falsely accuses Judah of attempted assassination. Although Judah is not guilty and receives no trial, he is sent to the Roman galleys for life; his mother and sister are imprisoned in a Roman jail, where they contract leprosy; and all the family property is confiscated. Judah first encounters Jesus, who offers him a <b>drink</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and encouragement, as Judah is being marched to a galley to be a slave. Their lives continue to intersect as the story unfolds.|$|E
25|$|Kelly's first {{documented}} {{brush with}} the law was on 15 October 1869 {{at the age of}} 14 when he was charged with the assault and robbery of Ah Fook, a pig and fowl trader of Chinese descent from Bright. According to Fook, as he was passing Kelly's house, Kelly approached him with a long bamboo stick, announcing that he was a bushranger and would kill him if he did not hand over his money. Kelly then allegedly took him into the bush, beat him with the stick and stole 10 shillings. According to Kelly, his sister Annie and two witnesses, Bill Skilling and Bill Grey, Annie was sitting outside the house sewing when Fook walked up and asked for a <b>drink</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Given creek water, he abused Annie for not giving him rain water, and Kelly came outside and pushed him. Fook then hit Kelly three times with the bamboo stick, causing him to run away. The visitor then walked away, threatening to return and burn the house down, and Kelly did not return until sundown. Historians find neither account convincing and believe that Kelly's account is likely true up to being hit by Fook but then Kelly probably took the stick from him and beat him with it.|$|E
