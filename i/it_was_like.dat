5|$|I {{was sitting}} there in the theater at the back, showing it to people for the first time. I mean, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> a puddle of sweat around my feet. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E
5|$|Colleagues have testified that, {{far from}} feeling bound or stifled by the Whiteman orchestra, as Green {{and others have}} suggested, Bix often {{felt a sense of}} exhilaration. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> {{attending}} a music school, learning and broadening: formal music, especially the synthesis of the American vernacular idiom with a more classical orientation, so much sought-after in the 1920s, were calling out to him.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{there had}} been a muffled thud or deadened {{explosion}} within the ship. Now, without warning she seemed to start forward, moving forward and into the water at an angle of about fifteen degrees. This movement with the water rushing up toward us was accompanied by a rumbling roar, mixed with more muffled explosions. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> standing under a steel railway bridge while an express train passes overhead mingled with the noise of a pressed steel factory and wholesale breakage of china.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} I {{distinguish}} {{the notion of}} there being something <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> {{a certain kind of}} creature from that of there being something <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to have a certain kind of experience. Work on consciousness has typically dealt with the latter while employing the language of the former. I propose several ways of analyzing what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> a certain kind of creature and find problems with them all. The upshot is that even if there <b>is</b> something <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to have certain kinds of experience, it does not follow that there <b>is</b> anything <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> a certain kind of creature. Skepticism about the existence of something that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> an F is recommended...|$|R

5|$|She wrote popular {{articles}} for newspapers, including an advice column for girls, describing what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> {{to be an}} actress, and answering questions from readers. For adult readers, Michelena wrote other pieces such as {{a history of the}} moving picture industry. In 1920 when she stopped making films, she returned to her career as a singer.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus. The actor {{was tired}} of doing {{independent}} films where his expectations were not met; when he met with director Bryan Singer, he went into a 15-minute tirade telling him what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> to work with him. After Baldwin was finished, Singer told him exactly what he expected and wanted, which impressed the actor.|$|E
5|$|With Misery we had {{the luxury}} of doing a two-day shoot, which is totally luxurious these days. And we got to do what we love the most, which is just fashion and making {{beautiful}} images, and not having any rules. It was very much on the fly. We went downtown to the abandoned Sears building; it’s all destroyed and creepy in there. We were there for two days and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> an art project.|$|E

5|$|Here {{came the}} Rabbi, his back bent, his face shaved... His mere {{presence}} among the deportees added {{a touch of}} unreality to the scene. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> a page torn from some story book... One by one they passed in front of me, teachers, friends, others, all those I had been afraid of, all those I once could have laughed at, all those I had lived with over the years. They went by, fallen, dragging their packs, dragging their lives, deserting their homes, the years of their childhood, cringing like beaten dogs.|$|E
5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E

5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. Vitti had wanted an episode centered on Mrs. Krabappel that examined what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> to have Bart as a student. It was the first episode of the show to feature her in a prominent role. The subplot where Homer tries to clean up his language was written partially {{in response to the}} complaints the show had been getting about the amount of cursing on the show. Woodrow's voice was performed by Harry Shearer, who did an impression of Ricardo Montalbán. The picture Bart sends Edna is of NHL and WHA star Gordie Howe. The writers had originally wanted to use a picture of American football player Johnny Unitas, but were unable to get the rights to use his image.|$|E
5|$|Tobe Hooper, then {{preparing}} both Invaders From Mars and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, was mooted as director. Golan and Globus misunderstood {{the concept}} of the character ("They thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> The Wolf Man", said director Joseph Zito) and instructed writer Leslie Stevens, creator of The Outer Limits, to write a treatment reflecting their misconception. In Stevens' story, a corporate scientist intentionally subjects ID-badge photographer Peter Parker to radioactive bombardment, transforming him into a hairy, suicidal, eight-armed monster. This human tarantula refuses to join the scientist’s new master-race of mutants, battling a succession of mutations kept in a basement laboratory.|$|E

40|$|A {{widespread}} assumption {{in current}} philosophy of {{mind is that}} a conscious state’s phenomenal properties vary with its representational contents. In this paper, I present (rather dogmatically) an alternative picture that recognizes two kinds of phenomenal properties that do not vary concomitantly with content. First, it admits phenomenal properties that vary rather with attitude: what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> {{for me to see}} rain is phenomenally different from what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for me to remember (indistinguishable) rain, which is different again form what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for me to visualize (indistinguishable) rain – where these differences cannot be traced back to variations in content. Secondly, {{there is a kind of}} phenomenal property that varies neither with content nor with attitude but is altogether invariant across all conscious states: a substantive phenomenal commonality among what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for me to see, remember, and visualize rain, cats, or dogs. This substantive commonality, I will suggest, is the for-me-ness component of what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for me to have any of these experiences. I will close by discussing the interrelations among these three concentric layers of phenomenality: content-based, attitude-based, and for-me-ness...|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{that of the}} pied currawong, {{the grey}} currawong's call does not sound like its name. It {{is best known for}} making a sound {{variously}} transcribed as p'rink, clink, cling, ker-link or tullock, either in flight or when gathered in any numbers. The call has been described as very loud and ringing in the Tasmanian and Kangaroo Island subspecies; Edwin Ashby wrote that in Tasmania it was akin to the squeaking of a wheelbarrow and Gregory Mathews that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> the kling of an anvil. Elsewhere, their call has been likened to the screech of ungreased metal grinding in Victoria and South Australia (races versicolor and melanoptera are noted as similar to each other), and as a harsh squeak in Western Australia. The clinking call resembles that of the superb lyrebird, which imitates the currawong call at times.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} people in Wales had seen an opera, {{and they had no}} idea what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> The opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those who were members of Welsh nonconformist churches needed reassurance {{that this was not a}} theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. The majority of participants in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that the participants were not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1941, Wheeler and three of his {{batteries}} were assigned to fight against German and Italian forces in the North African Campaign. In September, they set sail from Glasgow aboard the RMS Empress of Russia; because the Mediterranean was controlled largely by enemy naval forces, {{they were forced to}} travel via the Cape of Good Hope, before taking shore leave in Durban. There, Wheeler visited the local kraals to compare them with the settlements of Iron Age Britain. The ship docked in Aden, where Wheeler and his men again took shore leave. They soon reached the British-controlled Suez, where they disembarked and were stationed on the shores of the Great Bitter Lake. There, Wheeler took a brief leave of absence to travel to Jerusalem, where he visited Petrie on his hospital deathbed. Back in Egypt, he gained permission to fly as a front gunner in a Wellington bomber on a bombing raid against Axis forces, to better understand what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> for aircrew to be fired on by an anti-aircraft battery.|$|E

5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> a day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long a wisp of cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E

Thomas Nagel, Raymond Smullyan, Douglas Hofstadter, and Robert Nozick tackle the problem of translating the experiences of one being into terms another can understand. But can we ever know what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> another self? For that matter, what can we know about what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> ourselves? Hofstadter and Dennett's commentary suggest that self-knowledge is elusive, {{to say nothing of the}} experience of other minds.|$|R
