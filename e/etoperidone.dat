50|$|Lorpiprazole (INN) (brand name Normarex) is a marketed {{anxiolytic}} drug of the phenylpiperazine group. It {{has been}} described as a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI) in the same group as trazodone, nefazodone, and <b>etoperidone.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is as an {{antagonist}} {{of several}} receptors {{in the following}} order of potency: 5-HT2A receptor (36 nM) > α1-adrenergic receptor (38 nM) > 5-HT1A receptor (85 nM) > α2-adrenergic receptor (570 nM); it has only very weak or negligible affinity for blocking the following receptors: D2 receptor (2,300 nM) > H1 receptor (3,100 nM) > mACh receptors (>35,000 nM). In addition to its receptor blockade, <b>etoperidone</b> also has weak affinity for the monoamine transporters as well: serotonin transporter (890 nM) > norepinephrine transporter (20,000 nM) > dopamine transporter (52,000 nM).|$|E
5000|$|Mepiprazole (INN, BAN) (brand name Psigodal) is an {{anxiolytic}} drug of the phenylpiperazine {{group with}} additional antidepressant properties that is marketed in Spain. It {{acts as a}} 5-HT2A and α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist and inhibits the reuptake and induces the release of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine to varying extents, and {{has been described as}} a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI). Controlled clinical trials of mepiprazole in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were also carried out and suggested some benefits of the drug in relieving symptoms of IBS in some patients. [...] Similarly to other phenylpiperazines like trazodone, nefazodone, and <b>etoperidone,</b> mepiprazole produces mCPP as an active metabolite.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the psychotropic drug <b>etoperidone</b> on the {{response}} to laboratory stressors was investigated in a controlled study. Cardiovascular and hormonal (catecholamines, corticotropin, and cortisol) measurements were made {{in a group of}} young, healthy volunteers during a cold pressor test (CPT), a mental arithmetic test (MAT), and insulin-induced hypoglycaemia (ITT). One-week treatment with <b>etoperidone</b> (ETO) (150 mg/day, orally) reduced basal and stress-induced values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) on CPT, while it did not alter catecholamine output in response to the stressor. Cardiovascular response was also attenuated after ETO on MAT, {{in the absence of any}} hormone changes. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol secretions were markedly reduced on ITT after ETO, whereas catecholamine outflow and cardiovascular parameters were substantially unaffected. These findings on ITT suggest that the anti-serotoninergic and anti-alpha 1 -adrenergic activities of ETO may be used in the pharmacological control of the potentially detrimental consequences of the stress response...|$|E
