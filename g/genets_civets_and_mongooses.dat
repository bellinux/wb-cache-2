40|$|Southern Africa {{is renowned}} for its wealth of animal life both in numbers and variety. Antelope in countless herds once roamed the plains, while the large mammals, the {{so-called}} big game, have drawn hunters to this continent {{from all over the}} world. Selected wildlife products such as ivory, rhino horn and skins have been articles of trade for centuries. But far more important, zoologically, is the fact that in this region representative of 51 families of mammals occurs, a greater variety than {{are to be found in}} any other zoo-geographical region. These are all placental mammals, and no monotremes or marsupials are bound here. The region is also characterized by the absence of bears, true deer, wild sheep* and goats. Another striking feature is that no less than 12 families are endemic, the most characteristic of which are the hoofed mammals. The antelopes from the major group of herbivorous mammals and probably the most remarkable component of the fauna of this region, numbering at least 30 species and ranging from the large eland (Taurotragus oryx) measuring two m at the shoulder and weighing 700 kg, to the diminutive and delicately built blue duiker (Cephalophus monticola). Although horses do not occur in the wild state, the fossilized remains of a true horse (Equus capensis) have been recorded. The family is, however, well represented by at least four species of zebra. From the viewpoint of this paper, however, the carnivores are the most important order and are also particularly well represented; in fact, the lion may be regarded as symbolic of the sub-continent. Representatives of the order include the <b>civets,</b> <b>genets,</b> <b>mongooses,</b> <b>and</b> meerkats; the honey-badger, otters, and weasels; the dog family such as jackals and hyenas; the large cat family, and that peculiar animal, the aardwolf (Proteles cristatus), which is endemic...|$|R

The eight species in the family exhibit significant variations in form. These differences initially led to the species in this family sharing common names with, and being placed in the different families of, apparently more similar species on the mainland (e.g. <b>civets</b> <b>and</b> <b>mongoose).</b> However, phylogenetic analysis of DNA provides strong evidence that all Malagasy carnivorans evolved from a single common ancestor that was a herpestid (Yoder et al. 2003). Recent phylogenetic analysis supports this view and places all of the Malagasy carnivorans in the family Eupleridae (Gaubert et al. 2005).|$|R

50|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{divergence between}} the herpestids and the euplerids {{dates back to}} the Oligocene;. At that time, feliforms shared many similarities, particularly between the cats and the viverrids. Palaeoprionodon (within the superfamily Aeluroidea), found in Europe and Asia from the late Eocene or early Oligocene, looked similar to the modern fossa, while Proailurus, an extinct form of cat, exhibited many viverrid-like characteristics. Despite these similarities in the fossil record, the modern Malagasy carnivores are distinctly different, with the Euplerinae and Galidiinae subfamilies bearing similarities with <b>civets</b> <b>and</b> <b>mongooses,</b> respectively. Species in Euplerinae (including the fossa, falanouc, <b>and</b> Malagasy <b>civet)</b> have auditory regions similar to those of viverrids, while those in Galidiinae have auditory regions similar to those of herpestids. Based on this trait, Robert M. Hunt Jr. proposed in 1996 that Madagascar was colonized twice, once by viverrids and once by herpestids. However, the genetic studies by Yoder and colleagues in 2003 suggested that a single colonization event occurred by a primitive herpestid ancestor, which was quickly followed by adaptive radiation. The common ancestor arrived from Africa, probably by rafting, during the late Oligocene or early Miocene (24-18 Mya), though Philippe Gaubert and Veron estimated a divergence date of 19.4 Mya (16.5-22.7 Mya).|$|R

40|$|The food habits, {{movement}} and activity patterns, and habitat use of sympatric carnivores, and wildlife harvest and utilization, were {{studied at the}} Taohong Village, Jiangxi Province, southeastern China during 1992 – 1996. ^ Food habits of four species of sympatric carnivores were studied by scat analysis. Crab-eating mongooses (Herpestes urva) had the most diversified diet that included many water-edge food items. Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) consumed {{a large proportion of}} fruits. Both small Indian <b>civets</b> (Viverricula indica) <b>and</b> hog badgers (Arctonyx collaris) fed heavily on rodents. Though there was a certain degree of difference in habitat use among these species, the rather high diet overlap suggested that the population densities of these species were reduced to a very low level by constant harvest pressure and secondary poisoning so that the diet ceased to have relevant effect on the sympatry of these species. The food habits (based on scat analysis) of the sympatric dhole (Cuon alpinus) and wolf (Canis lupus) showed that their depredation on the endangered Sika deer (Cervus nippon kopschi), domestic animals and small carnivores was negligible. ^ Telemetry studies showed that small Indian civets, masked palm <b>civets,</b> <b>and</b> crab-eating <b>mongooses</b> did not have permanent dens but moved among their numerous daybeds. Small Indian civets used daybeds among the bushes and grass on the ground while other species used underground dens exclusively. Small Indian <b>civets</b> <b>and</b> crabeating <b>mongooses</b> limited their activity to the foothills at low altitude, while masked palm civets included habitat of higher altitude in their home ranges. Both small Indian <b>civets</b> <b>and</b> masked palm <b>civets</b> were nocturnal, but the latter had a low activity level in the daytime. Crab-eating mongooses were active in the daytime. ^ Ferret badgers (Melogale moschata) were strictly nocturnal. Their daybeds included both natural and man-made sites. The lack of direct conflict of interest with humans allowed them to live in close proximity to human settlement. ^ Wildlife harvest during the 1992 / 96 harvest seasons was studied by the method of participant observation. Wildlife harvesters comprised 1. 5 % of the local population, and a few professional harvesters accounted for {{a large proportion of the}} game yield. Shotguns and two kinds of traps were the most common harvest methods used. Muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) and hares (Lepus sinensis and L. capensis) were the most important game species. In spite of the steady increase in the price of wildlife parts, the game yields experienced a gradual decline due to reduced harvest efforts. Wildlife harvest was market-oriented and played an insignificant supplemental role in the local economy. Marketing channels for both pelt and game meat have been well established and are spreading. Wildlife harvest remained largely unregulated. The prospect of wildlife harvest at Taohong is discussed and recommendations to control harvest are proposed. ...|$|R

5|$|The fossa was {{formally}} described by Edward Turner Bennett {{on the basis}} of a specimen from Madagascar sent by Charles Telfair in 1833. The common name is the same as the generic name of the Malagasy civet (Fossa fossana), but they are different species. Because of shared physical traits with <b>civets,</b> <b>mongooses,</b> <b>and</b> cats (Felidae), its classification has been controversial. Bennett originally placed the fossa as a type of civet in the family Viverridae, a classification that long remained popular among taxonomists. Its compact braincase, large eye sockets, retractable claws, and specialized carnivorous dentition have also led some taxonomists to associate it with the felids. In 1939, William King Gregory and Milo Hellman placed the fossa in its own subfamily within Felidae, the Cryptoproctinae. George Gaylord Simpson placed it back in Viverridae in 1945, still within its own subfamily, yet conceded it had many cat-like characteristics.|$|R

Galidiines, which share some characters with both the <b>civets</b> <b>and</b> <b>genets</b> (current Viverridae) <b>and</b> the <b>mongooses</b> (Herpestidae), were allied early on both with the former and the latter, with some going as far as to doubt that they should be placed in a different subfamily than the other mongooses.|$|R

Some predators, such as snakes, raid nests and eat eggs and chicks. Nile crocodiles sometimes attack drinking queleas, and an individual in Ethiopia hit birds out of the vegetation on the bank into the water with its tail, subsequently eating them. Queleas drinking at a waterhole were grabbed from below by African helmeted turtles in Etosha.
