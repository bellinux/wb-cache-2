25|$|Apple's {{earliest}} computers, {{along with}} other personal computers of the period, had extremely limited graphical capabilities and could originally display only uppercase ASCII using a set bitmap font. The IIc and Enhanced Apple IIe expanded on this, supporting 40 or 80 columns of text and an <b>extended</b> <b>character</b> set called MouseText. It was used to simulate simple graphical user interfaces, similar {{to the use of}} ANSI X3.64.|$|E
25|$|BBSes were {{generally}} text-based, rather than GUI-based, and early BBSes conversed using the simple ASCII character set. However, some home computer manufacturers extended the ASCII character set {{to take advantage}} of the advanced color and graphics capabilities of their systems. BBS software authors included these <b>extended</b> <b>character</b> sets in their software, and terminal program authors included the ability to display them when a compatible system was called. Atari's native character set was known as ATASCII, while most Commodore BBSes supported PETSCII. PETSCII was also supported by the nationwide online service Quantum Link.|$|E

Greek and Cyrillic fonts support ISO Adobe 2 and Latin <b>Extended</b> <b>characters,</b> and support super/sub-script OpenType feature.|$|R

25|$|There {{were many}} {{shortcomings}} {{in the original}} Line 21 specification from a typographic standpoint, since, for example, it lacked many of the characters required for captioning in languages other than English. Since that time, the core Line 21 character set has been expanded to include quite a few more characters, handling most requirements for languages common in North and South America such as French, Spanish, and Portuguese, though those extended characters are not required in all decoders and are thus unreliable in everyday use. The problem has been almost eliminated with a market specific full set of Western European characters and a private adopted Norpak extension for South Korean and Japanese markets. The full EIA-708 standard for digital television has worldwide character set support, {{but there has been}} little use of it due to EBU Teletext dominating DVB countries, which has its own <b>extended</b> <b>character</b> sets.|$|E

500|$|Once {{principal}} photography was finished, Forman {{found himself}} with miles of raw material, {{so he and}} his editor, Miroslav Hájek, spent many long hours organizing the footage {{into a series of}} situations, like the [...] "big dance" [...] situation and the [...] "meeting the parents" [...] situation. In turn, each of these situations are constructed out of sequences of gags in which the characters improvise, in the words of commentator Constantin Parvulescu, [...] "like various instruments of a band": [...] "Many of these situations can be broken down into gags. There are several such gags reminiscent of early comedy in Loves of a Blonde: the soldiers-getting-off-the-train gag; the wine-bottle gag; the wedding-ring gag; the palm-reading gag; the roll-up-blinds gag; and the three-guys-in-two-beds gag." [...] Interspersed with these gags are <b>extended</b> <b>character</b> improvisations, such as Milda's discussion of Picasso, his mother's rants at the dining table, and the factory supervisor's appeal for the army's support.|$|E
5000|$|Newskool changed {{significantly}} {{as the result}} of the introduction of <b>extended</b> proprietary <b>characters.</b> The classic 7-bit standard ASCII characters remain predominant, but the <b>extended</b> <b>characters</b> are often used for [...] "fine tuning" [...] and [...] "tweaking".

5000|$|In most vendor extensions, <b>extended</b> <b>characters</b> {{are placed}} in the various zones {{reserved}} for user-defined characters, each of which are normally regarded as associated with the preceding zone.For example, additional [...] "graphical characters" [...] (e.g., punctuation marks) {{would be expected to}} be placed in the 0xa3c0-0xa3fe range, and additional logograms would be placed in either the 0xc6a1-0xc8fe or the 0xf9d6-0xfefe range.Sometimes, this is not possible due to the large number of <b>extended</b> <b>characters</b> to be added;for example, Cyrillic letters and Japanese kana have been placed in the zone associated with [...] "frequently-used characters".|$|R
500|$|The adult fandom of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic {{has led to}} {{references}} to the program in popular culture. The animated television show Mad spoofed Friendship Is Magic at least twice; one segment was called [...] "My Little War Horse". An episode of Bob's Burgers, [...] "The Equestranauts", satirized bronies and their conventions. A secret level in the video game Diablo III included enemies named [...] "Rainbow Western", [...] "Midnight Sparkle" [...] and [...] "Nightmarity", alluding to Friendship Is Magic. Owlchemy Labs added a [...] "Brony Mode" [...] to their video game Snuggle Truck as free downloadable content in October 2012 specifically as {{a nod to the}} brony community. The mode replaces the fuzzy animals in the game with Friendship Is Magic-inspired ponies which the user must drive safely across a landscape. An <b>extended</b> <b>character,</b> the Mechromancer, available as downloadable content for the game Borderlands 2, includes numerous {{references to}} the show and the fans through the character's skill tree. Bronies: The Musical is a 2014 off-Broadway production written by Tom Moore and Heidi Powers that is inspired by the brony culture, and won for Best Musical in the Hollywood Fringe Festival. The popularity of the show {{as a result of the}} brony fandom led to a brief bit of animation created by the show to be used in an NFL advertisement during Super Bowl XLIX.|$|E
60|$|Balafre was, in short, a keen soldier, hardened, selfish, {{and narrow}} minded; active and bold in the {{discharge}} of his duty, but acknowledging few objects beyond it, except the formal observance of a careless devotion, relieved by an occasional debauch with brother Boniface, his comrade and confessor. Had his genius been of a more <b>extended</b> <b>character,</b> he {{would probably have been}} promoted to some important command, for the King, who knew every soldier of his bodyguard personally, reposed much confidence in Balafre's courage and fidelity; and besides, the Scot had either wisdom or cunning enough perfectly to understand, and ably to humour, the peculiarities of that sovereign. Still, however, his capacity was too much limited to admit of his rising to higher rank, and though smiled on and favoured by Louis on many occasions, Balafre continued a mere Life Guardsman, or Scottish Archer.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the modular {{properties of the}} characters which appear in the partition functions of nonabelian fractional quantum Hall states. We first give the annulus partition function for nonabelian FQH states formed by spinon and holon (spinon-holon state). The degrees of freedom of spin are described by the affine SU(2) Kac-Moody algebra at level $k$. The partition function and the Hilbert space of the edge excitations decomposed differently according to whether $k$ is even or odd. We then {{investigate the}} full modular properties of the <b>extended</b> <b>characters</b> for nonabelian fractional quantum Hall states. We explicitly verify the modular invariance of the annulus grand partition functions for spinon-holon states, the Pfaffian state and the 331 states. This enables one to extend {{the relation between the}} modular behavior and the topological order to nonabelian cases. For the Haldane-Rezayi state, we find that the <b>extended</b> <b>characters</b> do not form a representation of the modular group, thus the modular invariance is broken.
