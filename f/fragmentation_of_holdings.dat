A monetized urban {{property market}}, based on high land values, already existed by the 10 th century. Extensive records survive from the 12 th century onwards, and are now being used in ways which make it possible reliably to compare the values of properties over time, and between different localities. Trends in values reflect a complex interaction between demographic, economic, and political change. Town-dwellers displayed a consistent response to the property market throughout the period. Urban property was a means of storing rather than of creating wealth, and its use by private individuals was closely related to career- and life- cycles. The <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>holdings</b> (especially in the period up to 1300) and highly differentiated values, both produced by the market, profondly influenced the physical appearance and the social topography of towns. Legal changes altered the structure of urban estates, making it possible for landlords to maintain control over their holdings in the long term. After 1600, newly built-up areas could thus take on a new form, contrasting with the fragmented pattern of the older urban centres. Keene Derek. The property market in English towns, A.

40|$|Access to land {{is deeply}} {{important}} in rural India, where {{the incidence of}} poverty is highly correlated with {{lack of access to}} land. The author provides a framework for assessing alternative approaches to improving access to land by India's rural poor. He considers India's record implementing land reform and identifies an approach that includes incremental reforms in public land administration to reduce transaction costs in land markets (thereby facilitating land transfers) and to increase transparency, making information accessible to the public to ensure that socially excluded groups benefit. Reducing constraints on access to land for the rural poor and socially excluded requires five key issues: restrictions on land-lease markets, the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>holdings,</b> the widespread failure to translate women's legal rights into practice, poor access to (and encroachment on) the commons, and high transaction costs for land transfers. Among guidelines for policy reform the author suggests: a) Selectively deregulate land-lease (rental) markets, because rental markets may be important in giving the poor access to land. b) Reduce transaction costs in land markets, including both official costs and informal costs (such as bribes to expedite transactions), partly by improving systems for land registration and management of land records. c) Critically reassess land administration agencies and find ways to improve incentive structures, to reduce rent-seeking and base promotions on performance. d) Promote women's independent land rights through policy measures to increase women's bargaining power within the household and in society generally. e) Improve transparency of land administration and public access to information, to reduce rent-seeking by land administration officers and to strengthen poor people's land rights (and knowledge thereof). f) Strengthen institutions in civil society to provide the awareness, monitoring, and pressure needed for successful reform and to provide checks and balances on inappropriate uses of state power. In a companion paper (WPS 2124) the author addresses these issues at the level of a particular state - Orissa, one of India's poorest states - in an empirical study, from a transaction costs perspective, of social exclusion and land administration.

40|$|This paper aims {{to give an}} {{overview}} of the main technical and policy issues that have {{to be taken into account}} when land consolidation is implemented in the most practicable way. The paper focuses on land consolidation for agricultural purposes, that is land consolidation as an instrument to abolish <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> agricultural <b>holdings.</b> Land consolidation for specific non-agricultural purposes such as nature and landscape is not an issue in this paper. Land consolidation on a voluntary basis implies too much uncertainty with respect to its final results. Land consolidation can only be carried out in an efficient way when it is based on special legislation. Therefore the description of the land consolidation process in this paper emanates from a process provided by law. In countries where land consolidation already has a long history, procedures have become rather complicated, because over the years the instrument of land consolidation has been developed in such a way that the fulfilment of a variety of different goals with respect to the development of the rural area can be achieved. The advanced multi-purpose character of the instrument may imply that the instrument is becoming too inert. Therefore there is a need t...|$|R
40|$|Small farms {{characterize}} {{agriculture in}} Asia. With the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> land <b>holdings,</b> the average size of farms {{fell in the}} region, while the number <b>of</b> small-size <b>holdings</b> increased significantly. These small-scale farmers {{play an important role}} for food security and poverty alleviation. However, whether and how these small farms can survive under globalization is a hotly debated topic. In particular, the traditional claim that "small is beautiful," which is based on empirical observation that small farms present higher land productivity than large farms, is being challenged. It has been shown that a positive relationship also exists between farm size and labor productivity (and therefore income). To help these small farms prosper under increasing globalization, the governments have to change the "business as usual" attitude. Innovative land reform, for example, is crucial to secure property rights to farmers and to increase farm size. Equally important is the reform of public institutions in order to help small farmers to have access to credit, marketing, and technology. Moreover, promoting diversification in the production of high-value commodities can {{play an important role in}} raising the small-holders' income. Finally, policies that facilitate urban-rural migration and promote the development of the rural nonfarm sector are essential to help alleviate poverty among small-farm households and among the rural poor in general.

40|$|The 1945 {{agrarian reform}} in Albania changed the {{distribution}} of landownership. The land of the largest landlords was distributed to 70, 000 families who either did not own any land or owned very little. Since this agrarian reform, land tenure structures have continually changed according to the organizational form of the agricultural sector. In the early 1990 s, when the centralized economy {{was transformed into a}} market economy, landownership also had to change. Through the application of a 1991 law, approximately 383, 000 families received about 500, 000 hectares from the ex-cooperatives. In 1992, state-farm workers' families obtained the state-farm land. As a result of privatization, 480, 000 farms were created. Land fragmentation is a relatively new phenomenon in Albania, but when privatization of agricultural land was concluded each family had a farm holding that was fragmented into many different parcels. Land fragmentation in Albania appears to be a spatial and territorial phenomenon, which means subdivision into many parcels of farmland that cannot support rational utilization of land.

This has been {{in the form of a}} spatially elaborated implementation of the precautionary principle adopted in the Maastricht treaty from 1992 by the EU (Andersen, 2000). We concretised these rules in relation to actual landscape practices among primary producers of sugar beet in Denmark, we simulated the co-existence of GM and conventional sugar beet in an area of intensive sugar beet production on Lolland, South Eastern Denmark. The theoretical basis for our work finds three major sources of inspiration namely Ulrich Beck’s theory of the `Risk Society´, Torsten Hägerstrand’s concept of `the progress landscape´ and its relation to the social practices of land users, and Brian Wynne’s studies of the discrepancy between theoretical and practical knowledge related to environmental risk. The farmers, who were involved in the study, were interviewed concerning their opinions on land use practices in cases of co-existence. Interviews were carried out both before and after the study took place. It is concluded that although the farmers are positive towards the possibility of introducing GM sugar beet, it is not realistic to expect the rules of co-existence to be observed, which makes the risk assessment behind the new rules unrealistical.

The Work Participation Rates (WPR) for males has {{increased}} {{during the period}} 1993 - 94 to 2009 - 10, whereas the same for females has been fluctuating around {{a lower level of}} 15 to 20 per cent. Thus, unemployment rates for females have been higher than males. A sector-wise distribution of workers shows that the proportion of males employed in the farm sector has been declining in favour of the Non-Farm Sector (NFS), while the females are more concentrated in the farm sector. Thus, females stand in a more disadvantageous situation in the rural labour market as indicated by their low WPR, higher unemployment rates and low level of diversification into NFS. However, gender equality is necessary for growth. This is more so with regard to education and employment. India has introduced the concept of inclusive growth in the Eleventh Five Year Plan. Inclusive growth ensures opportunities for all sections of the population, with a special emphasis on the poor, particularly women and young people, {{who are most likely to}} be marginalised. A rapidly growing population in India has not only increased the size of the rural labour force but has also led to <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> land <b>holdings.</b> Thus, this sector alone cannot create additional employment opportunities, even in high growth agriculture states of India. This has led to the growth of a vibrant non-farm sector. The study comes up with the suggestion that the NFS, with its greater potential of employment generation, can not only solve the unemployment problem, but can also lead to the increased access of women to resources and employment opportunities...|$|R

The production system is a little known Buddhist agropastoral system in the high altitude Spiti Valley (agriculture up to 4450 m, livestock grazing 4900 m, total area ca. 12, 000 km 2) in the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh. The local population (ca. 10, 000) belongs to one of the three Buddhist sects Gelukpa, Shakyapa, or Ningmapa, is related by blood, and shares a common Tibetan dialect. Family is the basic unit of production, though families are highly dependent upon the community to meet production goals. A village council appointed on rotation and functioning democratically is responsible for village administration, and is the arbiter of all decision-making pertaining to collective work and settling disputes. The council ensures equal access of families to common resources, as well as equitable distribution of responsibilities among them. Systems of primogeniture, celibacy, and polygamy seem to have prevented the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> land <b>holdings</b> and limited population growth.

30|$|The study {{offers an}} insight into the {{historical}} development of the Kangayam grassland in a rain deficit region of south India. The Kangayam grassland in its present state of expanse has been in place for the last one hundred and fifty years. The grazing lands are all in private ownership and there are no communal grazing lands. The unoccupied wastelands were taken on lease by a growing human population between 1855 and 1881 and live fences of B. berryi were raised along the field boundaries. A system of rotational grazing of livestock in the paddocks was introduced which required minimal labour input. Careful management of the grazing paddocks was adhered to, among which was the withholding of animals for a month after initiation of rain to let the grass crop come up well and maintaining an optimum number of Acacia trees. Supplementary feeding is also practiced during lean period between March and June when the grass is almost completely grazed by the animals. The sustainable management of the grassland over a century also had some positive social spinoffs such as moderate growth in human population and a healthy female to male ratio. Alternatively, the necessity to check human population growth may also have arisen to prevent the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> land <b>holdings,</b> making them unsustainably small. Unfortunately, the sustainable management of the Kangayam grassland in a low rainfall region has remained unheard of beyond its immediate vicinity because people, places and events mostly make the news for the wrong reasons. A serene, sustainable system and society hardly makes any sensational news and thus remains obscured from the world at a large. This example provides some important lessons to emulate and replicate elsewhere in the areas of policy measures, technological interventions, and collective action to enhance the livelihood opportunities of livestock farmers.|$|R

The potential maximum epidemic size was also estimated. All parameters were calculated for three time periods: the 3 -yearly network, the yearly and the monthly networks. The yearly and the monthly networks were more fragmented than the 3 -yearly network. On average, one-third <b>of</b> the <b>holdings</b> were isolated in the yearly networks and almost three quarters in the monthly networks. This represented an immense {{reduction in the number}} <b>of</b> <b>holdings</b> participating in the trade of the monthly networks.

S 1 nuclease treatment of the agarose plugs containing cells suggested {{that the majority of}} DNA fragments did not contain single-strand gaps. Chromosomal DNA fragmentation was inhibited by cycloheximide, indicating that protein synthesis was required for DNA fragmentation. Phosphonoacetic acid, an inhibitor of EBV DNA polymerase, did not inhibit <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> chromosomal DNA. These findings suggest that EBV-specific early proteins participate in <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> chromosomal DNA. Chromosomal DNA of P 3 HR- 1 cells was also fragmented by treatment with n-butyrate plus 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA), which induced activation of latent EBV genome following viral replication. In addition, <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> DNA preceded cell death during lytic infection. These results suggest that <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> chromosomal DNA is generally induced during EBV replication and probably contributes to the cytopathic effect of EBV. The role <b>of</b> DNA <b>fragmentation</b> in death <b>of</b> infected cells is discussed in relation to apoptosis...|$|R
