Korshunov remembered [...] "She never misses a chance of buying new books when competing in other places. Elena swallows one book after another. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> book lying, next to her bag one day, a new one is there the next day." [...] She played checkers. She enjoyed going on angling trips with Viktor, her father, and Gennady. [...] "I like to read and listen to music, but mostly I enjoy a few quiet hours by the water. I love to go fishing. I {{spend a lot of time}} fishing with my father or my coach, either on a lake in a boat, or on the banks of the Neva." [...] She enjoyed cooking and baking. As with many gymnasts she has a fondness for ice cream.|$|E

6000|$|To {{think how}} eager {{we are in}} {{building}} our houses! To think others shall be just as eager, and we quite indifferent! <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> building the house that serves him a few years, or seventy or [...] eighty years at most, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> building the house that serves him longer than that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Want to fly, hey? Wal, {{excuse me}} from them birds. <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>one,</b> an' thet's enough for me.... An', changin' the subject, Miss Lenore, beggin' your pardon--you ain't ridin' {{in the car}} much these days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By Saint Paul!" [...] said he, passing {{his hands}} over the engine, [...] "I have heard men talk of these things, but never before have <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>one.</b> It {{is none other than}} one of those wondrous new-made bombards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, indeed, he did,' said John. 'This {{is what he}} says to me. [...] "Never have <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> more {{gentle and}} engaging, and I feel sure she would have gained more on our {{affections}} every day, and proved herself a treasure to the family."' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{quite so}} crude, Wingate," [...] he said. [...] "I know an enemy when <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>one,</b> but I wasn't {{thinking}} {{of getting rid}} of you that way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do, but it {{is another}} thing to stand {{laughing}} here. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> thing that I shall do--I shall take away your picture and hang it in my room.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Methinks <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> {{straight}} line of houses there,' I observed, shading my eyes with my hand. 'But it is distant, and the shimmer {{of the sun}} disturbs the sight.' ...|$|E
60|$|WANDA. No; I am verree quiet. Since I {{know your}} brother, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> no <b>one,</b> sare.|$|R
60|$|The Khania was {{a lovely}} woman. Never to my {{knowledge}} have <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> lovelier, but oh! how coarse and poor she showed beside the wild, ethereal beauty of Ayesha born again. For that beauty was not altogether human, far less so indeed {{than it had been}} in the Caves of Kor; now it was the beauty of a spirit.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's no mistake," [...] {{said the}} landlord. [...] "I had my suspicions when I first clapped eyes on him. I seed he wasn't our usual sort, and I seed how {{he tried to}} hide his face. If he weren't the Bishop, then I don't know a Bishop when <b>I</b> <b>sees</b> <b>one,</b> that's all. Besides, there's his bag, and there's his sermon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know," [...] I said, [...] "I am {{absolutely}} inexperienced as regards fowls. I just {{know enough to}} help myself to bread sauce when <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>one,</b> but no more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not on your sweet life. I know a good sailor when <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>one.</b> But if he don't {{leave you}} alone I'll give him the worst licking he's ever had." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I see pockets," [...] {{the man in}} the trance was saying. [...] "I {{see many}} pockets, but they are all empty. No; <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> pocket that is not empty." ...|$|E
25|$|ARMITAGE: <b>I</b> {{have never}} <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> named.|$|R
60|$|I {{sing the}} Equalities; I sing the endless finales of things; I say Nature continues--Glory continues; I praise with {{electric}} voice: For <b>I</b> do not <b>see</b> <b>one</b> imperfection in the universe; And <b>I</b> do not <b>see</b> <b>one</b> cause or result lamentable at {{last in the}} universe.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{knew that}} before, Harry," [...] Mrs. Holl said severely, [...] "for I told you {{over and over}} again that your mother was a lady, though she was in bad circumstances, and I think, after {{charring}} in respectable houses for the last twenty years, I ought to know a lady when <b>I</b> <b>sees</b> <b>one.</b> Well, there's nothing as you think I could do about it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Quin, with a {{measured}} voice. [...] "I {{have heard the}} glad tidings of great joy. Shall we take a hansom down to Kensington? <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> over there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{may come}} to that. I have other plans in my head, however, which may be tried first. I think that <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> {{way out of it}} which would simplify matters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why send {{a public}} {{officer on the}} duty? <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>one,</b> there, in the livery of Queen Anne. We are no lovers of Her Majesty's servants, and would not willingly form disagreeable acquaintances." ...|$|E
60|$|It was as {{if these}} lazy ones delighted in filth. Again and again have <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> or another throw the {{scrapings}} of the trencher bowls just outside {{the door of the}} tent or hut, where those who came or went must of a necessity tread upon them, and one need not struggle hard to realize what soon was the condition of the village.|$|R
6000|$|... "She shall go," [...] he {{declared}} grimly. Drops stood upon his brow. [...] "Why should I let that woman make my life miserable? Never have <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> day of freedom from trouble since I have known her. You are right, Vivienne. Héloise must be sent away before I {{can take you}} home. But she shall go. I have decided. I will turn her from my doors." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, father," [...] replied Betty, {{turning her}} eyes in the {{direction}} towards which Paul gazed. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>see</b> only <b>one</b> man," [...] she added.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I shall get {{a manager}} somewhere, no doubt," [...] said Henchard, with strong {{feeling in his}} tones. [...] "But it will be long before <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> that would suit me so well!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's that?" [...] he said. [...] "I know a--pretty--woman when <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>one,</b> and all I can say is, I don't see {{the young}} man about that's fit for her; but perhaps--you--do, come, perhaps--you-do!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Wyndham nodded. [...] "I expect we'll find Rupert Wyndham the worst. However, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> advantage; none of {{the three}} knows our plans and all theirs clash. We are not up against a combine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It’s a fact,” he said, “that when I am {{at home in}} Malata <b>I</b> <b>see</b> no <b>one</b> consciously. <b>I</b> {{take the}} {{plantation}} boys for granted.” ...|$|R
6000|$|EGO. [...] "'I {{thought it}} was Saxon; but, instead of two swords [the Saxon mark], <b>I</b> <b>see</b> only <b>one,</b> which is well worth both of them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{heard of}} {{threshers}} catchin' fire," [...] said Anderson, as if dumfounded, [...] "but <b>I</b> never <b>seen</b> <b>one....</b> Now {{how on earth}} did that happen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I think they're beastly, they're horrid,' she cried. 'If <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>one,</b> {{it gives}} me the creeps all over. If one were to crawl on me, I'm SURE I should die--I'm sure I should.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Mabel, [...] "now you're very nice! But let's be frank. You were {{thinking}} about another drama, in real life, that touches you close. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> comfort; there's no Lady Macbeth in the piece." ...|$|E
60|$|Har. Sen. You are weary now, I know, sea-beat and weary; 'tis time we respite further ceremony; besides, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> coming, whom I {{know you}} long to embrace, and I should be unkind {{to keep you}} from her arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just traveling. I'm glad we're going together, Mr. Morton. I don't {{think most}} of these cattlemen are very nice. Except for the old Jews. They seem to be fine old coots. They make you think of--oh--you know--prophets and stuff. Watch 'em, over there, making tea. I suppose the steamer grub ain't kosher. <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> on the Joy Line saying his prayers--I suppose he was--in a kind of shawl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell {{him that}} <b>I</b> <b>see</b> no <b>one.</b> <b>I</b> am ill. <b>I</b> will not <b>see</b> him, be his {{business}} what it may. Do you hear, child? Go {{and send him}} away." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Our {{house is}} on the eastern slope of Rupert Mountain, just off a country road, still unpaved then, and five {{miles from the nearest}} town...Even at the most unpromising times of year– in mudtime, on bleak, snowless winter days– it is in so many {{unexpected}} ways beautiful that even after all this time I have never quite gotten used to it. <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> other places equally beautiful in my time, but never, anywhere, have <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> more so." ...|$|R
