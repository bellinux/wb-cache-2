5|$|In 1090/91, the Byzantines under Constantine Dalassenos {{recovered}} Chios. Undeterred, Tzachas rebuilt his forces, {{and resumed}} his attacks, even proclaiming himself emperor (basileus) and seeking to conclude an alliance against Alexios I with the Pechenegs in Thrace for a joint attack on Constantinople. In 1092, Dalassenos {{and the new}} megas doux, John Doukas, were sent against Tzachas, and attacked the fortress of Mytilene on Lesbos. Tzachas resisted for three months, but <b>finally</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> negotiate a surrender of the fortress. During his return to Smyrna, Dalassenos attacked the Turkish fleet, which was almost destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the start}} of the 20th century, two-thirds of the Mississippi farmers who owned land in the Delta were African American. Many had become overextended with debt during the falling cotton prices of the {{difficult}} years of the late 19th century. Cotton prices fell throughout the decades following the Civil War. As another agricultural depression lowered cotton prices into the 1890s, however, numerous African-American farmers <b>finally</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> sell their land to pay off debts, thus losing the land which they had developed by personal labor.|$|E
25|$|In 772 Pepin's son Charlemagne {{started the}} final {{conquest of the}} Saxon lands. Though his ongoing campaigns were successful, he {{had to deal with}} the {{fragmentation}} of the Saxon territories in Westphalian, Eastphalian and Angrian tribes, demanding the conclusion of specific peace agreements with single tribes, which soon were to be broken by other clans. The Saxons devastated the Frankish stronghold at Eresburg; their leader (Herzog) Widukind refused to appear at the 777 diet at Paderborn, retired to Nordalbingia and afterwards led several uprisings against the occupants, avenged by Charlemagne at the (alleged) Massacre of Verden in 782. Widukind <b>finally</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pledge allegiance in 785, having himself baptised and becoming a Frankish count. Saxon uprisings continued until 804, when the whole stem duchy had been incorporated into the Carolingian Empire.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Tournay or Pont-à-Chin on 22 May 1794 was a Coalition victory. Pichegru {{attacked}} the allies with 62,000 beginning at 5:00 am. First contact occurred between the French brigade of Herman Willem Daendels and troops under Bussche at Spiere. After some fighting, Bussche withdrew across the Scheldt at Warcoing. Bitter fighting continued for 15 hours as the French tried to overrun the Coalition positions, but they <b>finally</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> retreat. In the following weeks, York {{was left to}} defend Tournai while the decisive actions occurred at Ypres and Charleroi. The French began the Siege of Ypres on 1 June and accepted its surrender on 18 June. The Coalition position in Belgium began to collapse and Brussels fell to Pichegru on 10 July.

25|$|Pope Clement XIV died {{suddenly}} on September 22, 1774 {{at the age}} of 68. His pontificate had been dominated by the problem of the Society of Jesus. The various courts under the House of Bourbon and the Kingdom of Portugal (under the House of Braganza) urged the general suppression of the order. The Pope tried to defend Jesuits and to temporize, but <b>finally</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> capitulate, and in 1773 he issued the Brief Dominus ac Redemptor which suppressed the Society of Jesus. Father Lorenzo Ricci, general of the order, had been imprisoned in the Castel Sant'Angelo. However, the Jesuits still had many adherents in the Roman Curia and in the Sacred College of Cardinals. The attitude toward Jesuits remained the main criterion of the appreciation of the candidates to the papal succession in the subsequent conclave.|$|E
25|$|Permission to sit the Pass School was granted. Betjeman famously {{decided to}} offer a paper in Welsh. Osbert Lancaster tells the story that a tutor came by train twice a week (first class) from Aberystwyth to teach Betjeman. However, Jesus College {{had a number of}} Welsh tutors who more {{probably}} would have taught him. Betjeman <b>finally</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> leave {{at the end of the}} Michaelmas term, 1928. Betjeman did pass his Divinity examination on his third try but was 'sent down' after failing the Pass School. He had achieved a satisfactory result in only one of the three required papers (on Shakespeare and other English authors). Betjeman's academic failure at Oxford rankled with him for the rest of his life and he was never reconciled with C.S. Lewis, towards whom he nursed a bitter detestation. This situation was perhaps complicated by his enduring love of Oxford, from which he accepted an honorary doctorate of letters in 1974.|$|E
25|$|The company's {{third and}} last {{production}} was Handel's Acis and Galatea (performed with The Masque of Love) which {{opened at the}} Great Queen Street Theatre on March 10, 1902. Shaw had convinced the theatre's owner, W. S. Penley, to let them rent it for only £40 a week. Nevertheless, the production's finances were precarious. The 1901 Dido and Aeneas revival had not made any profit, and Acis and Galatea had no working capital apart from two or three small donations from friends, including one of £10 from Walter Crane. With insufficient {{money to pay the}} stage hands and other creditors, the planned two-week run had to be curtailed to six performances. According to Craig, the creditors' agents called at the theatre on the last night to ensure that no property was removed and even searched the bags of the chorus members as they left. Ellen Terry eventually paid the outstanding bills, but the Purcell Operatic Society was essentially bankrupt, and with no funds forthcoming for future productions, <b>finally</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> close down.|$|E

25|$|Charles {{spent the}} years 1702–06 in a {{protracted}} struggle with Augustus II the Strong; {{he had already}} inflicted defeat on him at Riga in June 1701 and took Warsaw the following year, but trying to force a decisive defeat proved elusive. Russia withdrew from Poland {{in the spring of}} 1706, abandoning artillery but escaping from the pursuing Swedes, who stopped at Pinsk. Charles wanted not just to defeat the Commonwealth army but to depose Augustus, whom he regarded as especially treasonous, and have him replaced with someone who would be a Swedish ally, though this goal proved hard to achieve. After years of marches and fighting around Poland he <b>finally</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> invade Augustus' hereditary Saxony to bring him out of the war. In the treaty of Altranstädt (1706), Augustus was indeed forced to step down from the Polish throne, but Charles had lost a valuable time advantage over his main enemy in the east, Peter I, who had had the time to recover and build up a new and better army.|$|E
25|$|Eventually {{a man was}} sighted who {{approached}} the settlement shouting. When near enough to be heard, he cried that Menéndez had taken the French fort and put all the French to the sword. A procession was formed to go forth and meet the victor. Soon after his triumphant reception in the fort, Menéndez heard of Ribault's party having been wrecked, and learned that a detachment had {{made its way to}} Matanzas Inlet. After an ineffective interview and an offer of 100,000 ducats ransom, the Huguenots surrendered to Menéndez, and met the same fate as their comrades at Fort Caroline. A second party, with Ribault himself, were also slain {{at the hands of the}} Spanish. A few, however, who belonged to the Catholic faith, were spared. The Indians, who had been particularly friendly with the French, resented the Spanish invasion and the cruelty of Menéndez, and led by their chief Saturiwa, made war upon the Spanish settlers. The latter were running short of provisions and mutinied during the absence of Menéndez, who had gone back to Cuba for relief, and who <b>finally</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> seek it from the King in person in 1567.|$|E
25|$|When, in August 1980, Anna Walentynowicz {{lost her}} job at the Gdańsk Shipyard because of her {{position}} as editor of the underground newspaper Robotnik Wybrzeze, her fellow workers took action. Around 16,000 employees of the shipyard discontinued their work and occupied its premises on the morning of August 14, demanding Walentynowicz’s re-employment, the erection of a monument in honor of the victims of the strikes of 1970, and a pay rise of 2000 zlotys, amongst other things. After negotiating with management and having most of their demands met, a vote was taken on August 16 leading to the strike being called off. By this time, however, many of the workers at facilities surrounding the Gdańsk Shipyard had begun their own strikes making similar demands, and it was decided that in solidarity with them, the workers in the shipyard would continue to strike despite their own demands having been met. By the next morning the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee (Polish shorthand: MKS) had been formed within the gates of the shipyard, intending to unite workers in the Gdańsk-Sopot-Gdynia area, coordinating action and maintaining and order {{to ensure the safety of}} the strikers. Lech Wałęsa, an electrician who had lost his job at the Gdańsk Shipyard in the strikes of 1976 was elected as chair of the MKS, while the remainder of the committee was composed of delegates from other facilities including Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda, and others. By August 18, the MKS represented workers from 156 separate enterprises, and the number was steadily growing. Just two days after the formation of MKS the Polish economy was brought to a standstill as workers struck at factories and ports all along the Baltic coast. By August 21, much of the country was affected by strikes, even including the inland mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area, as more and more workers joined independent unions. The Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee at Gdańsk was becoming the national center for trade union movement: a phenomenon which was itself unique to this series of events. In the strikes of the 1950s and ‘70s it was the lack of a central organized structure that had limited the mobilization potential of striking workers. Now the MKS had been specifically designed with this problem in mind - the decentralization of the workers’ movement – and was working for the first time to unify and strengthen the movement, coordinating strikes all across Poland. It was for this reason that the government of Edward Gierek found they could no longer buy off strikers with small concessions, and <b>finally</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> settle into heavy negotiations with the MKS.|$|E
