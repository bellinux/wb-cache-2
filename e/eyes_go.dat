5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: {{the left side of the}} brain interacts with the right side of the body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both <b>eyes,</b> <b>go</b> to the left side of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body, and visual input from the left side of the visual field.|$|E

500|$|In {{writing the}} script, the Breaking Bad staff decided {{early on that}} Gus would not speak much during the scene because they felt it was more {{dramatic}} that way and more appropriate for his character. Esposito felt the scene was a pivotal moment not only for his character, but for Gus' relationship with Walter, and a warning that Walter should continue to operate Gus' way or risk death. Regarding his character's murder of Victor, Esposito said: [...] "This had to be done. Someone did something, they got seen. ... It was about survival. This had to be done, but I {{could do it in}} a way that also sent a message to the people who weren't listening." [...] Bryan Cranston said he was not expecting the episode to take the direction it did. He called the scene [...] "painful, but beautifully crafted, and reasonably so", and commented on the contrast between Gus' calm demeanor and Walter's [...] "tap-dancing to stay alive". Cranston said of Esposito's performance, [...] "When he plays that bad character, his <b>eyes</b> <b>go</b> dead, and all it takes is to look into his eyes." [...] Gilligan said although Gus' actions in the scene were scripted, [...] "You'd be surprised how little I talked to Giancarlo about how he played that part ... This is a man with amazing instincts." ...|$|E

Lee and Tamposi then left for Kygo and Watt to work on the production where they followed the melodies and message of the demo. According to Tamposi, the producers brought the song to life.|$|E

60|$|His search {{not being}} rewarded with {{immediate}} success, {{he decided to}} return to the pit where his rykor lay chained and look to its wants. As he approached the end of the burrow that terminated in the pit he slackened his pace, stopping just within the entrance of the runway that he might scan the interior of the chamber before entering it. As he did so he saw the figure of a warrior appear suddenly in an opposite doorway. The rykor sprawled upon the table, his hands groping blindly for more food. Ghek saw the warrior pause and gaze in sudden astonishment at the rykor; he saw the fellow's <b>eyes</b> <b>go</b> wide and an ashen hue replace the copper bronze of his cheek. He stepped back as though someone had struck him in the face. For an instant only he stood thus as in a paralysis of fear, then he uttered a smothered shriek and turned and fled. Again was it a catastrophe that Ghek, the kaldane, could not smile.|$|E

At a time when nothing was known of you except that you had disappeared.

You understand that I know all your secret; all her part in it at least. And I know that you understand what loving duty lies before you. I see it in your eyes; your brave, true <b>eyes!</b> <b>Go!</b> and the Lord be with thee!' Her accustomed idiom had returned with prayer. She turned her head away, and, standing up, leaned against the window. Bending over, he took her hand and said simply: ...|$|E

[...] "President Sunday is a terrible fellow for one's intellect, {{but he is not}} such a Barnum's freak {{physically}} as you make out. He received me in an ordinary office, in a grey check coat, in broad daylight. He talked to me in an ordinary way. But I'll tell you what is a trifle creepy about Sunday. His room is neat, his clothes are neat, everything seems in order; but he's absent-minded. Sometimes his great bright <b>eyes</b> <b>go</b> quite blind. For hours he forgets that you are there. Now absent-mindedness is just a bit too awful in a bad man. We think of a wicked man as vigilant. We can't think of a wicked man who is honestly and sincerely dreamy, because we daren't think of a wicked man alone with himself. An absentminded man means a good-natured man. It means a man who, if he happens to see you, will apologise. But how will you bear an absentminded man who, if he happens to see you, will kill you? That is what tries the nerves, abstraction combined with cruelty. Men have felt it sometimes when they went through wild forests, and felt that the animals there were at once innocent and pitiless. They might ignore or slay. How would you like to pass ten mortal hours in a parlour with an absent-minded tiger?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Now {{winter was}} at hand; the days grew short and the nights long; {{and under the}} golden face of morning the isle would stand silver with frost. Word came from Holyfell to Frodis Water of a company of young men upon a journey; that night they supped at Holyfell, the next {{it would be at}} Frodis Water; and Alf of the Fells was there, and Thongbrand Ketilson, and Hall the Fair. Aud went early to her bed-place, and there she pored upon these fineries till her heart was melted with self-love. There was a kirtle of a mingled colour, and the blue shot into the green, and the green {{lightened}} from the blue, as the colours play in the ocean between deeps and shallows: she thought she could endure to live no longer and not wear it. There was a bracelet of an ell long, wrought like a serpent and with fiery jewels for the eyes; she saw it shine on her white arm and her head grew dizzy with desire. [...] "Ah!" [...] she thought, [...] "never were fine lendings better met with a fair wearer." [...] And she closed her eyelids, and she thought she saw herself among the company and the men's <b>eyes</b> <b>go</b> after her admiring. With that she considered that she must soon marry one of them and wondered which; and she thought Alf was perhaps the best, or Hall the Fair, but was not certain, and then she remembered Finnward Keelfarer in his cairn upon the hill, and was concerned. [...] "Well, he was a good husband to me," [...] she thought, [...] "and I was a good wife to him. But that is an old song now." [...] So she turned again to handling the stuffs and jewels. At last she got to bed in the smooth sheets, and lay, and fancied how she would look, and admired herself, and saw others admire her, and told herself stories, till her heart grew warm and she chuckled to herself between the sheets. So she shook awhile with laughter; and then the mirth abated but not the shaking; and a grue took hold upon her flesh, and the cold of the grave upon her belly, and the terror of death upon her soul. With that a voice was in her ear: [...] "It was so Thorgunna sickened." [...] Thrice in the night the chill and the terror took her, and thrice it passed away; and when she rose on the morrow, death had breathed upon her countenance.|$|E
6000|$|I am {{doubtful}} whether even Cinderella's {{luck was}} quite as satisfying {{as we are}} led to believe. After the carpetless kitchen and the black beetles, how beautiful the palace must have seemed--for the first year, perhaps for the first two. And the Prince! how loving, how gallant, how tender--for the first year, perhaps for the first two. And after? You see he was a Prince, {{brought up in a}} Court, the atmosphere of which is not conducive {{to the development of the}} domestic virtues; and she--was Cinderella. And then the marriage altogether was rather a hurried affair. Oh yes, she is a good, loving little woman; but perhaps our Royal Highness-ship did act too much on the impulse of the moment. It was her dear, dainty feet that danced their way into our heart. How they flashed and twinkled, eased in those fairy slippers. How like a lily among tulips she moved that night amid the over-gorgeous Court dames. She was so sweet, so fresh, so different to all the others whom we knew so well. How happy she looked as she put her trembling little hand in ours. What possibilities might lie behind those drooping lashes. And we were in amorous mood that night, the music in our feet, the flash and glitter in our eyes. And then, to pique us further, she disappeared as suddenly and strangely as she had come. Who was she? Whence came she? What was the mystery surrounding her? Was she only a delicious dream, a haunting phantasy that we should never look upon again, never clasp again within our longing arms? Was our heart to be for ever hungry, haunted by the memory of--No, by heavens, she is real, and a woman. Here is her dear slipper, made surely to be kissed. Of a size too that a man may well wear within the breast of his doublet. Had any woman--nay, fairy, angel, such dear feet! Search the whole kingdom through, but find her, find her. The gods have heard our prayers, and given us this clue. [...] "Suppose she be not all she seemed. Suppose she be not of birth fit to mate with our noble house!" [...] Out upon thee, for an earth-bound, blind curmudgeon of a Lord High Chancellor. How could a woman, whom such slipper fitted, be but of the noblest and the best, as far above us, mere Princelet that we are, as the stars in heaven are brighter than thy dull old <b>eyes!</b> <b>Go,</b> search the kingdom, we tell thee, from east to west, from north to south, and see to it that thou findest her, or it shall go hard with thee. By Venus, be she a swineherd's daughter, she shall be our Queen--an she deign to accept of us, and of our kingdom.|$|E
