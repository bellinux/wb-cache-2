50|$|Some {{local public}} {{transport}} observers and citizens feel that most road corridors are too narrow for developing <b>dedicated</b> <b>lanes</b> for BRTS. Further, enforcement of traffic is generally seen to be weak, and many doubt if the city {{will be able to}} enforce <b>dedicate</b> <b>lanes.</b> Last, many feel that city is not mature yet to accept <b>dedicated</b> <b>lanes,</b> and private vehicle users may not like the proposal.|$|R

5000|$|Dedicated {{right-of-way}} — An {{exclusive right-of-way}} {{is vital to}} ensuring that buses can move quickly and unimpeded by congestion. Enforcement of the <b>dedicated</b> <b>lane</b> can be handled in different ways, such as delineators, bollards, or colorized pavement.|$|E

50|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} a new {{proposal}} for a system of 5 fast tram lines at-grade was approved. However, only the planned line 3 was built following the original project, while the others eventually were built either as regular tram lines, with no <b>dedicated</b> <b>lane,</b> or as bus lines.|$|E
50|$|The Juárez-Lincoln International Bridge is an eight-lane {{bridge with}} and is 1008 ft long and 72 ft wide. The {{international}} bridge is for buses and non-commercial traffic only.

It has a <b>dedicated</b> <b>lane</b> for SENTRI program users.|$|E
50|$|Since August 2011, {{the city}} has {{operated}} a bus rapid transit system called Trans Sarbagita. Two main routes and some feeder lines are operated daily from 5 a.m. until 9 p.m. There is no <b>dedicated</b> <b>lane</b> for the buses: they run on main streets. In 2012 an average of 2,800 passengers per day used the service.|$|E
2500|$|Christie {{questioned}} {{the policy of}} allowing three <b>dedicated</b> <b>lanes,</b> saying [...] "I didn't know Fort Lee got three <b>dedicated</b> <b>lanes</b> until all this stuff happened, and I think we should review that entire policy. Because I don't know why Fort Lee needs three <b>dedicated</b> <b>lanes</b> {{to tell you the}} truth," [...] and [...] "the fact that one town has three <b>lanes</b> <b>dedicated</b> to it? That kind of gets me sauced [...]" [...] However, members of the New Jersey Assembly Transportation Committee said at a November 25, 2013, hearing that the Fort Lee entrance has been used by an even greater number of commuters from the surrounding Bergen County towns. PA officials, including Patrick Foye, confirmed that assessment in their sworn testimony at the committee hearing on December 9, 2013.|$|R

50|$|Pacific Coast Highway is a transitway station {{along the}} Harbor Freeway in Carson, California, located at its overcrossing with the Pacific Coast Highway in Los Angeles County. It {{is one of}} two that are outside of a {{dedicated}} transitway; however, the station has its own <b>dedicated</b> <b>lane</b> on the freeway. This station has a 244 space park and ride lot.|$|E
5000|$|RTA {{plans on}} {{implementing}} a limited-stop system called RapidLink along Magnolia Avenue, from Riverside to Corona, largely paralleling the existing Route 1 with limited stops and traffic-signal priority. The project as proposed would closely resemble LACMTA's Metro Rapid lines, with buses traveling in mixed traffic {{rather than a}} <b>dedicated</b> <b>lane.</b> Dubbed the Gold Line, the service {{is expected to begin}} operating in 2017.|$|E
50|$|Between Himes Avenue and downtown, {{southbound}} (westbound) {{traffic was}} shifted {{on to the}} original northbound lanes. However, those wishing to exit at either the Howard/Armenia or Himes Avenue exits continue on the original southbound lanes. Those exiting on Himes Avenue have one <b>dedicated</b> <b>lane</b> in the original southbound lanes. Traffic entering the freeway from Armenia Ave. now does so on the original northbound exit ramp. This creates an odd left-lane merge situation. However, to help motorists in this effort, the entrance ramp has a <b>dedicated</b> <b>lane</b> from the freeway entrance until just over the Himes Avenue bridge. Traffic heading northbound on Howard Avenue must now turn left onto Green Ave., left onto Armenia Avenue, and then right onto the entrance ramp in order to enter the freeway. While this setup is temporary, it has somewhat improved traffic flow in the area, as motorists who intend to exit at Howard/Armenia or Himes now exit the freeway much earlier.|$|E

50|$|Also in the '60s Eldon Industries, Inc. {{produced}} 1/32 scale slot {{cars and}} sets {{with a very}} modern lane change system for analogue cars branded Selectronc that used lane change sections with a <b>dedicated</b> <b>lane</b> change controller. The cars and transformer used diodes to separate the control signals from the hand controllers that allowed for both cars to run independently in the same lane.|$|E
50|$|The {{triangle}} {{created by}} the separation of Pembina Highway's northbound and southbound lanes at Osborne is also bisected by a <b>dedicated</b> <b>lane</b> reserved for Winnipeg Transit buses. The rightmost lane of Osborne {{along the side of}} the triangle is also reserved for buses; in 2007, the city of Winnipeg repaved the bus-only lanes in a different colour of pavement than the rest of the roadway.|$|E
50|$|The Transitway joins Regional Road 174 a short stretch past Blair, {{running in}} a <b>dedicated</b> <b>lane.</b> Route 95 buses exit at Montreal Road and Jeanne d'Arc Boulevard and stop on the ramps at {{ordinary}} bus stops; these will be upgraded to full Transitway stations by 2009, tentatively named Montreal/St. Joseph and Jeanne d'Arc Stations. On the 2006-2007 system map, OC Transpo had included Jeanne d'Arc as a transit station.|$|E

5000|$|A truckway is a <b>dedicated</b> <b>lane</b> {{for longer}} length trucks; for instance, the Florida Turnpike allows 96-foot long double trailer combinations, in {{contrast}} to normal Florida highways' 53-foot limit. Since the major cost of trucking is the fixed cost of the same trailer with its driver the cost per ton of operating with truckway size and weight allowances is 35 to 40 percent below the cost of operations on the non-truckways.|$|E
50|$|Since February 2009, {{construction}} was completed on Grand Central Parkway, {{with the exception}} of the station themselves. Construction was still ongoing along Casino Center Boulevard and 3rd St. The route is set to use a <b>dedicated</b> <b>lane</b> from Grand Central to Imperial/3rd St. From that point, it is to operate in mixed flow travel, with special stations built along the route. It is expected to terminate at the South Strip Transfer Terminal.|$|E

50|$|The Central Transitway is the {{downtown}} section of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada's Transitway. The {{section of the}} Transitway uses <b>dedicated</b> <b>lanes</b> on existing streets, namely Albert Street for westbound routes and Slater Street for eastbound routes. The <b>lanes</b> are <b>dedicated</b> to buses only on weekdays {{from the start of}} morning rush hour (6:00 am) to the end of evening rush hour (6:00 pm); they are otherwise open to regular traffic. Even during rush hour, regular traffic needs to cross the <b>dedicated</b> <b>lanes</b> to access right turning lanes.|$|R
