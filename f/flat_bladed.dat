They are deployed {{as a means of}} introduction for cameras and laparoscopic hand instruments, such as scissors, graspers, etc., to perform surgery hitherto carried out by making a large abdominal incision ('open' surgery), something that has revolutionized patient care. Today, surgical trocars are most commonly a single patient use instrument and have graduated from the 'three point' design that gave them their name, to either a <b>flat</b> <b>bladed</b> 'dilating-tip' product, or something that is entirely blade free. This latter design offers greater patient safety due to the technique used to insert them.|$|E

40|$|The {{flow field}} in a {{cylindrical}} container {{driven by a}} <b>flat</b> <b>bladed</b> impeller was investigated using particle image velocimetry (PIV). Three Reynolds numbers (0. 02, 8, 108) were investigated for different impeller locations within the cylinder. The results showed that vortices were formed at {{the tips of the}} blades and rotated with the blades. As the blades were placed closer to the wall the vortices interacted with the induced boundary layer on the wall to enhance both regions of vorticity. Finite time lyapunov exponents (FTLE) were used to determine the lagrangian coherent structure (LCS) fields for the flow. These structures highlighted the regions where mixing occurred as well as barriers to fluid transport. Mixing was estimated using zero mass particles convected by numeric integration of the experimentally derived velocity fields. The mixing data confirmed the location of high mixing regions and barriers shown by the LCS analysis. The results indicated that mixing was enhanced within the region described by the blade motion as the blade was positioned closed to the cylinder wall. The mixing average within the entire tank was found to be largely independent of the blade location and flow Reynolds number. © 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers...|$|E
40|$|The {{resistance}} {{characteristics in}} terms of power consumption, interpreted {{in terms of}} Power number (P- 0), of unbaffled surface aeration systems consisting of <b>flat</b> <b>bladed</b> impellers, were studied in two shapes of surface aerations tanks: square and circular. Experiments were conducted in three different sizes {{in each of the}} geometrically similar unbaffled square and circular surface aerators. Results have shown that the P- 0 cannot be simulated singularly either with Reynolds number R or with Froude number as there are scale effects; hence {{there appears to be a}} need for incorporating the effects of both R and F. It is found that P- 0 is uniquely related to a parameter X (=(FR 1 / 3) -R- 4 / 3), which is defined as a parameter governing the theoretical power per unit volume for both shapes of aeration tanks; however, such relationships are different for both shapes of aerators. Interestingly P- 0 values are always higher in square surface aerators than in circular surface aerators, which suggests that the circular surface aerators require less power input than the square surface aerators. The usefulness of such correlations was demonstrated in estimating the power requirement while achieving a required oxygen transfer coefficient in surface aerators...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A simple mobile {{engine-driven}} pneumatic paddy collector made {{of locally}} available materials using local manufacturing technology was designed, fabricated, and tested for collecting and bagging of paddy dried on concrete pavement. The pneumatic paddy collector had the following major components: radial <b>flat</b> <b>bladed</b> type centrifugal fan, power transmission system, bagging area, frame and the conveyance system. Results showed significant {{differences on the}} collecting capacity, noise level, and fuel consumption when rotational speed of the air mover shaft was varied. Other parameters such as collecting efficiency, air velocity, augmented cracked grain percentage, and germination rate were not significantly affected by varying rotational speed of the air mover shaft. The pneumatic paddy collector had a collecting efficiency of 99. 33 % with a collecting capacity of 2685. 00 kg/h at maximum rotational speed of centrifugal fan shaft of about 4200 rpm. The machine entailed an investment cost of P 62, 829. 25. The break-even weight of paddy was 510, 606. 75 kg/yr at a collecting cost of 0. 11 P/kg of paddy. Utilizing the machine for 400 hours per year generated an income of P 23, 887. 73. The projected time needed to recover cost of the machine based on 2685 kg/h collecting capacity was 2. 63 year.

40|$|An our {{research}} on Siena and Central Tuscany has {{enabled us to}} formulate hypotheses on the evolution, through time, of the different finishing techniques for exposed brick surfaces. We identified three main phases. 1. The first one dates back to {{between the end of}} the 12 th and {{the second half of the}} 13 th century. The most significant building is the cathedral of Siena: the original brick walls of the Romanesque church are finished with diagonal or herringbone hatching. The hatching was executed with a small flat-bladed axe, working the fired bricks one by one before laying. This technique links Siena cathedral to the Romanesque and early Gothic brick churches of the Po Valley. 2. A new finishing technique, one of the most refined in Europe, was introduced towards the end of the 13 th century. The most significant example is the first floor façade of the Town Hall of Siena. All the building work is in herringbone hatched rubbed bricks. Moreover, the first floor was planned to receive a red colouring directly spread on bricks, enriched, in the decorative features, with golden yellow and light blue. In order to obtain a hatching with accurate parallel lines, they could not have used an axe as in the previous phase. They might have used a thin <b>flat</b> <b>bladed</b> percussion tool, the strokes of which can be recognized. 3. The use of hatching in Siena did not continue beyond the second half of the 14 th century, and this trend seems common to other Tuscan towns. However, the taste for giving exposed brickwork a refined finish had not been exhausted. The 15 th-century façades of many gothic and renaissance buildings were entirely realized with rubbed bricks. According to Leon Battista Alberti the rubbing was done after the firing and before the laying, brick by brick, with the same technique as in the preceding century...|$|E
40|$|The most {{renewable}} energy used in Indonesia {{is coming from}} hydro energy. The hydro energy available in Indonesia is about 75000 - 76000 MW. From the whole water energy available in Indonesia there was just about 3, 783 MW being harnest for large scale power plants and about 220 MW for small-scale power plants. One of the small- scale hydro energy sources is from a small river which has a water speed range between 0. 01 m/s to 2. 8 m/s. Although having only a low water speed, the energy stored in it has a potential power to generate electricity. This low speed water flow usually used to move a water wheel to convert the water energy to another form of energy. The water flow hit directly to the water wheel blade which will force the water wheel runner to move and rotate so that the water kinetic energy would be converted to a mechanical energy to rotate a generator to produce electricity. Water flow has a potential {{renewable energy}} and it is environmentally friendly. This water flow potential energy could be converted to another form of energy such as mechanical energy, kinetic energy or electrical energy. Implementing water turbines {{is one way to}} convert the potential water energy to another form of energy. Most of undercurrent sources of hydropower were not observed seriously. However, there were some undercurrent water turbines research but it is not much. Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} find the best performance of a <b>flat</b> <b>bladed</b> undercurrent water turbine. The experiment was observed by implementing different blade numbers on a particular water flow rate. The study was conducted in experimental and theoretical analysis by implementing a blade number of 4, 6, and 8 blades. The water flow rate was maintained constant at 0. 0594 m 3 /s. The results showed that for the flat plate bladed turbine efficiency increases with the increasing of blade numbers. The maximum efficiency was achieved on the turbine with a blade number of 6. Furthermore, the turbine efficiency decreases when the number of blades is less than 6 blades...|$|E

Various mixer designs including a four pitched blades impeller, a six <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> impeller and four two <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> impeller were compared. Experimental data confirmed the analytical results previously obtained. The results showed that there are similarities regarding the effects generated by four pitched blades impeller {{and one of the}} two <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> impeller. Also, it is found that two shortblade impeller produces the lowest depression of all tested impeller. The maximum depression produced by all type of impellers do not exceeds 120 mmH 2 O at 400 rpm, which is a small value to realize the vaporization of the fluid and to reach the cavitation. The equipment is not in danger to be destroyed. The numerical results obtained by experiments can be used in various practical applications...|$|R
