25|$|One popular {{configuration}} for {{the mixing}} tube {{is a large}} bore tube {{with a series of}} internal baffles which create turbulence in the mixture after the <b>injection</b> <b>point,</b> which causes fairly rapid mixing to a homogenous mixture, which may then be continuously analysed by a monitoring instrument before further processing, or may be directly processed and analysed later from the storage cylinder. Continuous analysis allows adjustment of flow rate of the added gases to correct the mixture if it deviates from the specification. Post-analysis makes correction more difficult. Addition of components may be done in sequence or together. Adding them together means that mixing is done once, and this reduces the pressure loss in the intake system. It is important that the gases are thoroughly mixed before analysis as the analysis will then be more reliable. It is also highly desirable to ensure that the intake gases do not vary significantly in oxygen content over time for safety reasons, as the compressor will probably only be safe for a limited oxygen fraction.|$|E

These materials are mainly used in applications in actor or sensor technology. One example is the application as multipolar encoder wheel in magnetic sensors.

50|$|As {{emission}} control strategies grew {{more sophisticated and}} effective, the amount of unburned and partially burned fuel in the exhaust stream shrank, and particularly when the catalytic converter was introduced, the function of secondary air injection shifted. Rather than being a primary {{emission control}} device, the secondary air injection system was adapted to support the efficient function of the catalytic converter. The original air <b>injection</b> <b>point</b> {{became known as the}} upstream <b>injection</b> <b>point.</b> When the engine is cold, air injected at this point cleans up the extra-rich exhaust and raises the temperature of the exhaust so as to bring the catalytic converter to operating temperature quickly.

5000|$|The {{most common}} design uses two {{different}} basins: one {{catering to the}} autotrophic bacteria and the second to the heterotrophic bacteria. However, SNdN accommodates to both in one basin with strict control of DO. This {{has been done in}} two common approaches. One is to develop an oxygen gradient by adding oxygen in one location in the basin. Near the O2 <b>injection</b> <b>point,</b> a high DO concentration is maintained allowing for nitrification and oxidation of other organic compounds. Oxygen is the electron acceptor and is depleted. The DO level in localized environments decreases with increasing distance from the <b>injection</b> <b>point.</b> In these low DO locations, the heterotrophic bacteria complete the nitrogen removal. The Orbal process is a technology in practice today using this method. The other method is to produce an oxygen gradient within the bio floc. The DO concentration remains high in the outside rings of the floc where nitrification occurs but low in the inner rings of the floc where denitrification occurs. This method is dependent on the floc size and characteristics; however controlling flocs is not well understood and is an active field of study ...|$|E

Early versions of the LPCI system injected through the recirculation loops or into the downcomer.

A distributed oxygen feed through discrete <b>injection</b> <b>points</b> {{along the length of the}} reformer to control the heat in the reaction medium is compared with oxygen feeding through dense perovskite membranes and the conventional direct feeding of oxygen (co-feed). Equispaced and orthogonal <b>injection</b> <b>points</b> for oxygen distribution, as well as uniform and nonuniform oxygen flow distribution, are investigated. The results indicate that the staging distribution of oxygen enables one to control the hot-spot temperatures and to operate the reactor under safer operability conditions in contradistinction to the possibility of thermal runaway for the conventional co-feed mode of operation. The results also show that the nonuniform oxygen flow distribution is superior, with regard to hydrogen yield over uniform oxygen flow distribution, for both equispaced and orthogonal injection systems. This is due to the good control and high oxygen fluxes at the <b>injection</b> <b>points.</b> The equispaced <b>injection</b> system gives better hydrogen yield than the orthogonal injection system in a certain region of parameter space and vice versa in other regions.

50|$|The frequency-multiplication {{mechanism}} is {{designed in the}} following way: the bunches arriving at the delay loop have a frequency of approx. 0.5 GHz, and they are gathered in 240 ns long trains, which have a relative phase shift of 180°. The frequency of accelerating modules is thereby 1 GHz, so that all bunches are accelerated equally.The electromagnetic kicker at the <b>injection</b> <b>point</b> of the delay loop has a frequency of 0.5 GHz, so that only bunches of every second train are led into the delay loop. The length of the delay loop is set to 240 ns, so that the delayed train {{comes out of the}} loop simultaneously with the next train passing by the kicker. As a result, both trains leave the kicker together, their bunches being phase-shifted by 180°. Hence, trains of 240 ns length with 240 ns gaps between the trains are created, with a frequency of 1 GHz within the train. A similar principle is used in the combiner rings, with phase shifts of only 90° for the 4-combiner ring and 120° for the 3-combiner ring.|$|E
