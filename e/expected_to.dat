5|$|Despite {{the change}} in {{electron}} configuration, unbiunium is not <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> behave chemically very differently from its lighter congeners. A 2016 calculation on unbiunium monofluoride (UbuF) showed similarities between the valence orbitals of unbiunium in this molecule and those of actinium in actinium monofluoride (AcF); in both molecules, the highest occupied molecular orbital is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be nonbonding, unlike in the superficially more similar nihonium monofluoride (NhF) where it is bonding. Nihonium has the electron configuration 5f146d107s27p1, with an s2p valence configuration. Unbiunium may hence be somewhat like lawrencium in having an anomalous s2p configuration from relativistic effects that does not affect its chemistry: the bond dissociation energies, bond lengths, and polarisabilities of the UbuF molecule are <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> continue the trend down group 3. Hence lawrencium and unbiunium are <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be similar to lutetium and actinium respectively, and not thallium and nihonium {{as would be expected}} from looking at their electron configurations. The Ubu–F bond is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be strong and polarised, just like for the lighter group 3 monofluorides.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} our {{preliminary}} findings from an innovative module of survey {{questions in the}} RAND American Life Panel designed to measure willingness to delay take-up of Social Security benefits. Among respondents who <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> stop working full time prior to turning age 62, over 60 percent report that they <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> start claiming Social Security benefits after they turn 63 [...] that is, they <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> delay claiming. In contrast, among those who <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> stop full-time work sometime from age 62 to age 70, only about onequarter <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> delay claiming beyond the retirement age. Another main finding arises from reported probabilities of delayed claiming in hypothetical choice scenarios. These probabilities tend to be quite high relative to previous findings on delayed claiming outcomes. This result is particularly striking {{for those who are}} presented with information about the so-called "break-even age" for delayed claiming rather than information about the total amount of benefits that must be foregone during the one year delay. ...|$|R

50|$|Implied pot odds, {{or simply}} implied odds, are {{calculated}} {{the same way}} as pot odds, but take into consideration estimated future betting. Implied odds are calculated in situations where the player <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> fold in the following round if the draw is missed, thereby losing no additional bets, but <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> gain additional bets when the draw is made. Since the player <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> always gain additional bets in later rounds when the draw is made, and never lose any additional bets when the draw is missed, the extra bets that the player <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> gain, excluding his own, can fairly be added to the current size of the pot.

5|$|The {{electron}} {{configurations of}} Lr+ and Lr2+ are <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be 7s2 and 7s1 respectively, unlike the lanthanides {{which tend to}} be 5d1 as Ln2+. However, in species where all three valence electrons of lawrencium are ionized to give at least formally the Lr3+ cation, lawrencium is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> behave like a typical actinide and the heavier congener of lutetium, especially because the first three ionization potentials of lawrencium are predicted to be similar to those of lutetium. Hence, unlike thallium but like lutetium, lawrencium would prefer to form LrH3 than LrH, and LrCO is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be similar to the also unknown LuCO, both metals having a valence configuration of σ2π1 in their respective monocarbonyls. The pπ–dπ bond is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be observed in LrCl3 just as it is for LuCl3 and more generally all the LnCl3, and the complex anion − is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be stable just like its lanthanide congeners, with a configuration of 6d1 for lawrencium; this 6d orbital would be its highest occupied molecular orbital.|$|E
