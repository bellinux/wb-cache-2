25|$|The ESC {{system uses}} several sensors to {{determine}} what the driver wants (input). Other sensors indicate the actual {{state of the vehicle}} (response). The control algorithm compares <b>driver</b> <b>input</b> to vehicle response and decides, when necessary, to apply brakes and/or reduce throttle by the amounts calculated through the state space (set of equations used to model the dynamics of the vehicle). The ESC controller can also receive data from and issue commands to other controllers on the vehicle such as an all wheel drive system or an active suspension system to improve vehicle stability and controllability.|$|E
25|$|Dual zone {{climate control}} was a {{standard}} feature across the WH range, as was 12-mode trip computer {{integrated into the}} instrument cluster. Caprice including rear roof mounted climate control and stereo controls for rear passengers- rear passengers were also provided with two headphone jacks in the rear parcel shelf and could listen to a different audio source to the front occupants. A rear flip down table was incorporated into the rear armrest, complete with storage pocket and cup holders. The exclusive-to-Caprice options included standard Howe leather seats, 260-watt 12-speaker DSP audio system, individual ignition key memory (not available in Statesman- stereo settings, seating position) for three drivers, upright Holden crest logo on the bonnet, chrome exterior door handles, as well as heated side view mirrors and auto dipping passenger side view mirror to avoid alloy wheel damage when reversing. Headlights could be set to automatically sense low light levels and turn on without <b>driver</b> <b>input.</b> Caprice featured a fine chrome vertical bar grille, while Statesman used a chrome matrix style front grille design, and lacked chrome exterior door handles.|$|E
40|$|A. G. and H. B. {{have contributed}} equally to this work. Ascending and {{descending}} information is relayed through the thala-mus via strong, “driver ” pathways. According to our current knowl-edge, different driver pathways are organized in parallel streams {{and do not}} interact at the thalamic level. Using an electron microscopic approach combined with optogenetics and in vivo physiology, we examined whether <b>driver</b> <b>inputs</b> arising from different sources can interact at single thalamocortical cells in the rodent somatosensory thalamus (nucleus posterior, POm). Both the anatomical and the physiological data demonstrated that ascending <b>driver</b> <b>inputs</b> from the brainstem and descending <b>driver</b> <b>inputs</b> from cortical layer 5 pyr-amidal neurons converge and interact on single thalamocortical neurons in POm. Both individual pathways displayed driver proper-ties, but they interacted synergistically in a time-dependent manner and when co-activated, supralinearly increased the output of thala...|$|R

2500|$|General Motors (GM) {{worked with}} Delphi Automotive and {{introduced}} {{its version of}} ESC called [...] "StabiliTrak" [...] in 1997 for select Cadillac models. StabiliTrak was made standard equipment on all GM SUVs and vans sold in the U.S. and Canada by 2007 except for certain commercial and fleet vehicles.

The same year, Cadillac introduced an integrated vehicle handling and software control system, called Integrated Chassis Control System (ICCS), on the Cadillac Eldorado.

50|$|While a {{sequential}} {{manual transmission}} can (depending on the model) offer faster shift speeds and thus faster race times, many road-car-driving enthusiasts prefer a standard manual transmission, which—with a clutch pedal {{and the ability}} to skip gears—allows more <b>driver</b> <b>input</b> and a more traditional driving experience.|$|E

50|$|Tramlining is the {{tendency}} of a vehicle's wheels to follow the contours in the surface upon which it runs. The term comes from {{the tendency}} of a car's wheels to follow the normally recessed rails of street trams, without <b>driver</b> <b>input</b> {{in the same way}} that the train does. The same effect is sometimes called Nibbling.|$|E
50|$|The Tiptronic S is {{an upgrade}} to the {{original}} Tiptronic, {{with the ability to}} adapt to driver's behaviour, and also allows driver to change gears without entering manual mode.

40|$|Coming {{from the}} time {{constraints}} of VEX robotics while writing autonomous programs, ARC is a program that converts a <b>driver’s</b> <b>inputs</b> into written lines of code. Previously in this competition, writing out programs for these robots would require a programmer to map out each individual motor and sensor on the robot. This section of code is designed to allow a programmer to write large sections of code without typing them out by hand. ARC’s purpose is to make life much easier for the programmer, and streamline the programming process. Once activated, ARC takes the <b>driver’s</b> <b>input</b> and converts it into a program that the robot can read. Once {{the program has been}} recorded, the driver can copy the generated program into the main section of code, and the robot will replay the actions that the driver had previously performed. This could also be used as an educational tool for younger students learning how to program. By seeing live and relevant examples to what they need to program, they can learn what the code is doing, as well as how to do it for themselves...|$|R
2500|$|... (ABS) is an {{automobile}} safety {{system that allows}} the wheels on a motor vehicle to maintain tractive contact with the road surface according to <b>driver</b> <b>inputs</b> while braking, preventing the wheels from locking up (ceasing rotation) and avoiding uncontrolled skidding. It is an automated system that uses the principles of threshold braking and cadence braking which were practiced by skillful drivers with previous generation braking systems. It does this at a much faster rate and with better control than many drivers could manage.|$|R

Reportedly, the system will seamlessly transition between rear-wheel drive (RWD) and AWD with no <b>driver</b> <b>input</b> required.|$|E
50|$|Accelerometers {{are used}} in vehicle Electronic {{stability}} control systems to measure the vehicle's actual movement. A computer compares the vehicle's actual movement to the driver's steering and throttle input. The stability control computer can selectively brake individual wheels and/or reduce engine power to minimize the difference between <b>driver</b> <b>input</b> and the vehicle's actual movement. This can help prevent the vehicle from spinning or rolling over.|$|E

30|$|The <b>driver’s</b> control <b>input</b> will be {{affected}} by the driver’s subjective feelings, previewing time, reaction time, and other uncertain factors, which lead to a lack of uniform and accurate mathematical models in the study of closed-loop systems [1 – 5]. The study of inverse dynamics in vehicle handling is in contrast to the positive problem. When setting up a model without a <b>driver,</b> the <b>driver’s</b> <b>input</b> can be obtained if the model of the vehicle and the motion state are known [6, 7]. This method is able to compare the maneuverability of different vehicles operated in the most efficient manner. The specified maneuverability involves accurately reaching a given state variable [8, 9], tracking a given path accurately [10 – 12], and passing through the given path within the shortest time without deviating from the given path boundary [13, 14]. The latter situation is the issue studied in this research.|$|R
