500|$|Hartman {{was widely}} mourned in Hollywood. NBC {{executive}} Don Ohlmeyer stated that Hartman [...] "was {{blessed with a}} tremendous gift for creating characters that made people laugh. Everyone who {{had the pleasure of}} working with Phil knows that {{he was a man of}} tremendous warmth, a true professional and a loyal friend." [...] Guttenberg expressed shock at Hartman's death, and Steve Martin said he was [...] "a deeply funny and very happy person." [...] Matt Groening called him [...] "a master", and director Joe Dante said, [...] "He was one of those guys who was a dream to work with. I don't <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> didn't like him." [...] Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly concluded that Hartman was [...] "the last person you'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper" [...] and [...] "a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with." [...] In 2007, Entertainment Weekly ranked Hartman the 87th greatest television icon of all time, and Maxim named Hartman the top Saturday Night Live performer of all time.|$|E
2500|$|Hynde and Honeyman-Scott {{have both}} {{acknowledged}} the influence their contrasting styles had {{on each other}} (Guitar Player, 1981; Uncut, 1999). According to Honeyman-Scott, Hynde had a unique style he adjusted to in several ways: [...] "She does {{quite a bit of}} rhythm guitar, and I don't <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> plays like her. It's real distinct, and I can't count her beat half the time. Instead, I just put a little guitar line over it, like the lick in 'Tattooed Love Boys'" [...] (Guitar Player, 1981). He joked about his other strategy: [...] "I've never told them I can't work out their time at all! They are used to me coming in a bar too late; they think that's the way I play. But it's because I've missed where she comes in! I just bluff it and hope for the best." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since then many {{world famous}} authors have praised War and Peace as a {{masterpiece}} of the world literature. Gustave Flaubert expressed his delight in a January 1880 letter to Turgenev, writing: [...] "This is the first class work! What an artist and what a psychologist! The first two volumes are exquisite. I used to utter shrieks of delight while reading. This is powerful, very powerful indeed." [...] Later John Galsworthy called War and Peace [...] "the best novel that had ever been written". Romain Rolland, remembering his reading the novel as a student, wrote: [...] "this work, like life itself, has no beginning, no end. It is life itself in its eternal movement." [...] Thomas Mann thought War and Peace to be [...] "the greatest ever war novel {{in the history of}} literature." [...] Ernest Hemingway confessed that it was from Tolstoy that he'd been taking lessons on how to [...] "write about war in the most straightforward, honest, objective and stark way." [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> could write about war better than Tolstoy did", Hemingway asserted in his 1955 Men at War. The Best War Stories of All Time anthology.|$|E

5000|$|Robb Armstrong set out {{to portray}} young black couples from his own experience. In Marcy and Joe the reader sees an average middle class couple, busy with work and raising a family. Armstrong says, [...] "The image of young blacks is so skewed, so false. I don't <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who's</b> carjacking, playing basketball, rapping. Joe and Marcy and the {{characters}} I've developed are deep and based on real life." ...|$|R

6000|$|I do {{not know}} where Ballymulligan is, and never <b>knew</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> did. Once I asked the Mulligan the question, when that {{chieftain}} assumed a look of dignity so ferocious, and spoke of [...] "Saxon curiawsitee" [...] in a tone of such evident displeasure, that, as after all it can matter very little to me whereabouts lies the Celtic principality in question, I have never pressed the inquiry any farther.|$|R

60|$|Did he <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> else <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> us? The {{question}} {{appeared to}} him almost insulting. Everybody in Innsbruck knew us, honoured us, respected us--everybody, that is, except a few post-office officials, people quite out of society.|$|R
6000|$|... "It gave me up," [...] said Poppy, with {{a little}} tremulous laugh. [...] "I had a week’s pay instead of notice the day before yesterday.

5000|$|James L.

Your - your voice always catches on 'a writer.' I think it takes about 14 years to not have the catch in your voice if you’re very aggressive. It takes longer if you're not. Because ... so many of us have dreamt about it forever as a dream that could not be realized." ...|$|R

[...] "Moreover, you are too late, for the canoe is {{a hundred yards away}} by now, and you shan't have ours. Remember the Pauline maxims, old fellow, which you are so fond of quoting, and {{be all things to all}} men, and another that is more modern, that when you are at Rome, you must do as the Romans do; also a third, that {{necessity}} has no law, and for the matter of that, a fourth, that all is fair in love and war." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{was sorry}} to have old Samivel leave us, and we bid him a most {{friendly}} good-by, and promised if we ever <b>knew</b> of <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> wanted {{to go down the}} River Wye we would recommend them to ask at Ross for Samivel Jones to row them.|$|R

I don't know exactly where it is--and I don't <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> does, but that's no matter.

6000|$|We {{came back}} to town quietly, taking a bus to Hyde Park Corner. Jonathan thought it would {{interest}} me {{to go into the}} Row for a while, so we sat down. But there were very few people there, and it was sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made us think of the empty chair at home. So we got up and walked down Piccadilly. Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in the old days before I went to school. I felt it very improper, for you can't go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit. But it was Jonathan, and he was my husband, and we didn't <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> saw us, and we didn't care if they did, so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful girl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano's, when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said under his breath, [...] "My God!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tom, I {{certainly}} {{must ask}} you what business it is of yours," [...] said my mother, settling back into the hortatory attitude familiar to mothers. [...] "Supposing the thing is as you think,--suppose that Mary is a girl of refinement and education, who, from some unfortunate reason, has no resource but her present position,--why should you hunt her out of it? If she is, as you think, a lady, there is the strongest reason why a gentleman should respect her feelings. I fear the result of all this restless prying and intermeddling of yours will be to drive her away; and really, now I have had her, I don't know how I ever could do without her. People talk of female curiosity," [...] said my mother, with a slightly belligerent air; [...] "I never found but men had fully as much curiosity as women. Now, {{what will become of}} us all if your restlessness about this should be the means of Mary's leaving us? You know the perfectly dreadful times we had before she came, and I don't <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> has less patience to bear such things than you." ...|$|E

500|$|In the U.S., {{demand for}} the book {{dramatically}} increased. Within a week, sales had risen tenfold; it reached number 1 on amazon.com's best-seller list, and number 6 in the best-seller lists of the bookstore chains Borders Group and Barnes & Noble. A prominent critic of Chomsky's political views, Alan Dershowitz of Harvard Law School, told The New York Times that he believed most of those buying Hegemony or Survival would not read it, remarking that [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who's</b> ever read a Chomsky book". Furthermore, he related that the MIT professor [...] "does not write page turners, he writes page stoppers.

The wicked men; I should like to tear them to pieces. Why is not he in Parliament? and then they could not take him up. They never could arrest Charles Fox.

60|$|But {{his chief}} trouble {{was that he}} did not know any editors or writers. And not merely did he not know any writers, but he did not <b>know</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> had ever {{attempted}} to write. There was nobody to tell him, to hint to him, to give him the least word of advice. He began to doubt that editors were real men. They seemed cogs in a machine. That was what it was, a machine. He poured his soul into stories, articles, and poems, and intrusted them to the machine. He folded them just so, put the proper stamps inside the long envelope along with the manuscript, sealed the envelope, put more stamps outside, and dropped it into the mail-box. It travelled across the continent, and after a certain lapse of time the postman returned him the manuscript in another long envelope, on the outside of which were the stamps he had enclosed. There was no human editor at the other end, but a mere cunning arrangement of cogs that changed the manuscript from one envelope to another and stuck on the stamps. It was like the slot machines wherein one dropped pennies, and, with a metallic whirl of machinery had delivered to him a stick of chewing-gum or a tablet of chocolate. It depended upon which slot one dropped the penny in, whether he got chocolate or gum. And so with the editorial machine. One slot brought checks and the other brought rejection slips. So far he had found only the latter slot.|$|E

His house has been closed to me for twenty years--and my mother, who might have interceded for me, is dead. Can I appeal to the sympathy and compassion (once already refused in the hardest terms) of my merciless relatives in this city? I have appealed! I forced my way to them yesterday--I owned that I owed a sum of money which was more, far more, than I could pay. I drank the bitter cup of humiliation to the dregs--I even offered my daughter's necklace as security for a loan. Do you want to know what reply I received? The master of the house turned his back on me; the mistress told me to my face that she believed I had stolen the necklace. Was the punishment of my offense severe enough, when I heard those words? Surely I have asserted some claim to your pity, at last? I only want more time. With a few months before me--with my salary as housekeeper, and the sale of my little valuables, and the proceeds of my work for the picture-dealers--I can, and will, replace the money. You are rich. What is a loan of five thousand florins to you? Help me to pass through the terrible ordeal of your day of reckoning on the sixth of the month! Help me to see Minna married and happy! And if you still doubt my word, take the pearl necklace as security that you will suffer no loss." ...|$|E
