40|$|Humans with <b>darkly</b> <b>pigmented</b> skin display {{superior}} permeability {{barrier function}} {{in comparison with}} humans with lightly pigmented skin. The reduced pH of the stratum corneum (SC) of <b>darkly</b> <b>pigmented</b> skin could account for enhanced function, because acidifying lightly pigmented human SC resets barrier function to <b>darkly</b> <b>pigmented</b> levels. In SKH 1 (nonpigmented) versus SKH 2 /J (pigmented) hairless mice, we evaluated how a pigment-dependent reduction in pH could influence epidermal barrier function. Permeability barrier homeostasis is enhanced in SKH 2 /J versus SKH 1 mice, correlating with a reduced pH in the lower SC that colocalizes with the extrusion of melanin granules. <b>Darkly</b> <b>pigmented</b> human epidermis also shows substantial melanin extrusion in the outer epidermis. Both acute barrier disruption and topical basic pH challenges accelerate reacidification of SKH 2 /J (but not SKH 1) SC, while inducing melanin extrusion. SKH 2 /J mice also display enhanced expression of the SC acidifying enzyme, secretory phospholipase A 2 f (sPLA 2 f). Enhanced barrier function of SKH 2 /J mice {{could be attributed to}} enhanced activity of two acidic pH-dependent, ceramide-generating enzymes, β-glucocerebrosidase and acidic sphingomyelinase, leading to accelerated maturation of SC lamellar bilayers. Finally, organotypic cultures of <b>darkly</b> <b>pigmented</b> human keratinocytes display enhanced barrier function in comparison with lightly pigmented cultures. Together, these results suggest that the superior barrier function of pigmented epidermis can be largely attributed to the pH-lowering impact of melanin persistence/extrusion and enhanced sPLA 2 f expression. © 2014 The Society for Investigative Dermatology...|$|R

In addition to its dark coloration (vs. depigmented, translucent white body in congeners), the new species can be distinguished from its two congeners, Typhleotris madagascariensis and T. pauliani, by the sculpted, bony (vs. fleshy) appearance of its head with strongly protruding lateral ethmoid, sphenotic, and pterotic bones, and an elevated vertebral count...|$|R
40|$|The {{pigmentation}} {{of terrestrial}} invertebrates {{has been shown}} to function in the optimization of solar warming, yet pigmented aquatic invertebrates have never been examined for the ability to utilize solar illumination in a similar manner. The degree of carotenoid pigmentation in calanoid copepods is easily quantified, and comparisons between populations suggest that variation in copepod pigmentation is related to variation in water temperature, with the most <b>darkly</b> <b>pigmented</b> copepods occurring in the coldest lakes. <b>Darkly</b> <b>pigmented</b> copepods show significantly higher metabolic rates in the light than in the dark, whereas lightly pigmented copepods do not. The metabolic experiments provide evidence that dark coloration is adaptive to cold-water copepods because it facilitates significant internal warming of tissues by sunlight.

40|$|Background: Basal cell {{carcinoma}} (BCC) is the commonest malignancy among Caucasians in Europe, North America, and Australia. This study attempted {{to identify the}} prevalence, risk factors, and outcome of management of this problem in our region. Methods: All the patients with histologic diagnosis of BCC presenting to the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Calabar {{during the study period}} January 2000 to December 2009 were evaluated. Results: One hundred and fifty two patients (136 blacks, 16 albinos) were afflicted with skin malignancy, squamous {{cell carcinoma}} and BCC totaled 70 [SCC – 62, BCC – 8], and malignant melanoma (MM) – 16. Of the 8 patients, (3 males and 5 females, mean age 43 years, range 21 - 65 years) observed with BCC lesions, 2 (25 %) were <b>darkly</b> <b>pigmented</b> and 6 (75 %) were albinos. Most of the albinos who presented 3 decades before the <b>darkly</b> <b>pigmented</b> ranged in age from 21 - 60 years (mean 35. 7 years). The lesions afflicted the head and neck region, 9 (82 %), while 2 (18 %) were observed on the upper limb. All the patients had excision with satisfactory results during the period of follow up that ranged from 6 months to 3 years (mean 13 months). Conclusion: BCC is an uncommon lesion in our region. Albinism and solar radiation were identified risk factors. Most of the albinos presented 3 decades earlier than the <b>darkly</b> <b>pigmented.</b> Early institution of preventive measures, early diagnosis, and treatment would result in better outcome...|$|R

40|$|Purpose To {{determine}} whether prior instillation of amethocaine {{would increase the}} rate and magnitude of tropicamide-induced pupillary dilatation in <b>darkly</b> <b>pigmented</b> irides. Method A total of 50 healthy Africans aged 18 – 40 years, with <b>darkly</b> <b>pigmented</b> irides, received a drop of amethocaine in one eye and a drop of placebo in the contralateral eye, followed by two drops of tropicamide in both eyes. Serial pupil diameters were measured using a monocular infrared video pupillometer. Rate of pupillary dilatation was compared in both eyes. Survival statistics were calculated for the time taken to reach a clinically effective dilatation, clinically effective diameter (CED) of 6. 0 mm. Results Mean difference in pupil diameters between amethocaine- and placebo-treated eyes was 0. 30 ± 0. 09 mm (P < 0. 002). In all, 62 % of amethocaine-treated eyes and only 46 % of placebo-treated eyes reached the CED. Conclusion We observed a small but statistically significant potentiating effect of a drop of amethocaine on tropicamide-induced dilatation within 20 minutes...|$|R
50|$|Dark skin offers great {{protection}} against UVR {{because of its}} eumelanin content, the UVR-absorbing capabilities of large melanosomes, and because eumelanin can be mobilized faster and brought {{to the surface of}} the skin from the depths of the epidermis. For the same body region, light- and dark-skinned individuals have similar numbers of melanocytes (there is considerable variation between different body regions), but pigment-containing organelles, called melanosomes, are larger and more numerous in dark-skinned individuals. Keratocytes from dark skin cocultured with melanocytes give rise to a melanosome distribution pattern characteristic of dark skin. Melanosomes are not in aggregated state in <b>darkly</b> <b>pigmented</b> skin compared to lightly pigmented skin. Due to the heavily melanised melanosomes in <b>darkly</b> <b>pigmented</b> skin, it can absorb more energy from UVR and thus offers better {{protection against}} sunburns and by absorption and dispersion UV rays. <b>Darkly</b> <b>pigmented</b> skin protects against direct and indirect DNA damage. Photodegration occurs when melanin absorbs photons. Recent research suggest that the photoprotective effect of dark skin is increased by the fact that melanin can capture free radicals, such as hydrogen peroxide, which are created by the interaction of UVR and layers of the skin. Heavily pigmented melanocytes have greater capacity to divide after UVR irradiation, which suggests that they receive less damage to their DNA. Despite this, UVB damages the immune system even in darker skinned individuals due to its effect on Langerhans cells. The stratum corneum of people with dark or heavily tanned skin is more condensed and contains more cornified cell layers than in lightly pigmented humans. These qualities of dark skin enhance the barrier protection function of the skin.Although <b>darkly</b> <b>pigmented</b> skin absorbs about 30 to 40% more sunlight than lightly pigmented skin, dark skin does not increase the body's internal heat intake in conditions of intense solar radiation. Solar radiation heats up rather the body's surface and not the interior. Furthermore, this amount of heat is negligible compared the heat produced when muscles are actively used during exercise. Regardless of skin colour, humans have excellent capabilities to dissipate heat through sweating. Half of the solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface is in the form of infrared light and is absorbed similarly regardless of skin coloration.|$|R
