40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a rapid {{modeling}} method for micropumps, based on <b>electrical</b> <b>analogies</b> and equivalent networks. The different parts of a pump are modelled by means of lumped elements which are calculated using appropriate formulae. These elements are linked together to constitute a network which describes the entire electromechanical system. The networks built were implemented in an electrical simulation tool for rapid analysis. In the case of pneumatic actuation, the method was validated by a qualitative and quantitative comparison with results obtained by another method. The particular case of electrostatic actuation was also investigated, leading to the observation of specific features of this actuation mechanism. 1...|$|R
