50|$|Microfluidics is {{a widely}} {{represented}} research area within PSL*. On the Latin quarter campus, its institutions have developed considerable research capacities, notably the Ecole normale supérieure, Chimie ParisTech, ESPCI ParisTech and Curie Institute. Managed by the Fondation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, the Institute for Microfluidics will achieve this interconnexion.Microfluidics deals with the behaviour, control and manipulation of fluids that are geometrically to a sub-millimeter scale. It is a fundamentally multidisciplinary field, intersecting physics, chemistry, biotechnology, and engineering. DNA chips, micro-propulsion and micro-thermal technologies have all evolved from microfluidics. Microfluidics still has considerable potential applications, especially in its droplet-based and continuous-flow variants.Building upon the successful action of the Fondation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, the IPGG will provide researchers with cutting-edge research facilities, accelerate technology transfer with industry and create an environment conducive to innovation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop an algorithm that could be used in order to reduce the spread of chicken hatching in industrial incubators for chicken eggs. The approach that is used is based on frequency analysis of sounds recorded inside the <b>industrial</b> <b>incubator</b> and aims at identifying the time at which all the eggs inside the incubator have reached the internal pipping stage. The developed algorithm is able to be calibrated automatically in order to adjust for sounds around the incubator and the acoustics of every incubator. The algorithm has been implemented in a Digital Signal Processor and applied in real-time in an industrial environment. It is shown that the algorithm can correctly identify the time at which 93 - 98 % of the eggs have had been in the internal pipping stage. This level of accuracy is considered adequate for a practical application focusing on reduction of the hatching window. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|During {{the final}} phase of incubation, {{continuous}} recording and analysis of embryo sounds allow estimations about the percentage of hatched chickens. The objective {{of this study was to}} predict the time at which all eggs in an <b>industrial</b> <b>incubator</b> had passed the stage of internal pipping (IP 100 %). Chicken vocalization starts around day 19 when lung respiration commences. The amount of chicken vocalization increases during the hatching process, resulting in an increase of sound energy in the frequency range of 2500 to 3300 Hz. Using a standard microphone mounted inside the incubator, continuous sound recordings were processed to monitor the sound intensity during the hatching process. The method discussed in this article was assessed in an industrial-scale hatch setter (19, 200 eggs) and repeated five times. The results show that the sound intensity signal results in a specific pattern that holds information about the stage of hatching. It was shown for five trials that the time at which automatic IP 100 % detection occurred was within +/- 3 h of the manually observed time for IP 100 %. The results imply that real-time sound recording and analysis during incubation allow prediction of the hatch outcome in industrial incubators. Such an acoustic monitoring system might provide industrial users with valuable information for hatch management. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Both the {{increasing}} demand in objective data {{and the availability of}} cheap technology result in better monitoring practices for animal and human applications. Especially due to the high demand of meat, worldwide, and the occurrence of disease epidemics on a global scale -both among animals and from animals to humans  there will be an increasing demand for monitoring systems. Technology that can indicate the health or welfare status of individuals can contribute to a more efficient management or treatment. This thesis investigates how sound features can be used to monitor various species in real time, from group level to individual level. The first objective was to assess the possibility to extract physiological information of a group of animals during growth, only taking into account spectral information. The second objective was to assess if sound is capable of distinguishing short term changes in the status of living organisms both taking into account spectral information and the shape of the waveform of the examined sound signal. The third objective was to examine the importance of dynamics in vocalization on the behavioral state of individual organisms looking to the interaction between spectral information and shape of the waveform. In Chapter 2, a method is developed to monitor the growth stage of a group of chicken embryos in an <b>industrial</b> <b>incubator.</b> By knowing the moment that chicken embryos start hatching and the spread of the hatching in the entire incubator, incubation specialists can optimize their process management. Using spectral sound information of a group of 19. 200 embryos, it was shown that real time sound analysis allowed the detection of internal pipping, the moment at which embryos start breathing with their lungs. In Chapters 3 and 4, the monitored species is the pig. Respiratory problems contribute for up to 8 % of the mortality in commercial pig houses, causing considerable financial losses. By using sound analysis, a classification system was set up to classify and localize sick pig cough sounds based on their acoustic features. Chapter 3 only uses spectral information to distinguish sick from healthy cough sounds, while Chapter 4 assesses the dynamics of the energy envelope of the waveform as an indicator for sick cough sound. In Chapter 5, human cough sounds are analyzed at different degrees of lung inflammation. Instead of evaluating differences of acoustic parameters between groups of individuals, the effect of lung inflammation on acoustic parameters within every individual was assessed. Compared to Chapters 2, 3 and 4, the intra-subject variability, or individual monitoring, is very important to monitor the progression of lung inflammation. Furthermore, the technique developed on pig coughs to assess the dynamics of the energy envelope of the waveform was also extrapolated to human cough sounds. In Chapter 6, the degree of decoupling between energy envelope of the waveform and fundamental frequency variation in infant cry sounds is assessed towards a pain score basedon theModified Behavioural Pain Scale. Although no significant relation between the degree of decoupling of the sound features with the pain scores was observed, the technique developed in this chapter allows a new way of quantifying infant cry sounds and opens the door to longitudinal studies to monitor cortical development based on cry sound features. The overall conclusion of this thesis is that, depending on the complexity of the sound signal and the level on which organisms are monitored (in group or individual), spectral information alone; the combination of spectral and time domain information or the interaction between them, allows quantification of the biological status of living organisms in real time.

A total of 1800 fertilized Ross 308 eggs were used during the study. For each incubation trial, 10 focal eggs per incubator were individually monitored using EST sensors and video recordings. The results indicated EST measurements as a potential monitoring tool for detection of the exact hatching time of individual chicken embryos.

40|$|Innovation and {{competitiveness}} are important factors for promoting economic growth not only nationally, but regionally as well. In Romania, research, development and innovation could {{be among the}} factors that are accountable for the increasing regional disparities, as the territorial distribution of R&D resources is very unbalanced. Romania is currently trying to define a regional strategy for R&D, as well as appropriate policies and priorities for innovation at regional level. In this context we {{address the issue of}} the regional intensity of R&D as one of the main determinants of economic growth in Alba county (subregion NUTS 3) in Romania. The Alba subregion can be considered an obvious example of a successful economic transformation since its GDP per capita increased more than 2 times in 10 years, based on a high rate of economic growth. We have analysed the regional intensity of R&D, measured as the share of total research and development expenditures in regional GDP, and have developed an economic growth model that aimed to capture the influence of R&D intensity alongside labour productivity, employment rate, human capital, the share of manufacturing in total economic activity, the extent of private entrepreneurship, and a dummy variable for economic crisis. The results point to a highly significant impact of research and development intensity on the long-run economic development of Alba county, as measured by GDP per capita. This positive effect of R&D on the economic performance in Alba county can be largely attributed to the creation and modernization of the business support infrastructure aimed at developing <b>industrial</b> parks, business <b>incubators,</b> <b>industrial</b> and scientific clusters, technological and logistic platforms, centers for research and transfer of technology, etc. These structures are designed to support business development in areas affected by industrial restructuring, but also economic activities in other areas with development potential in the county, providing favorable conditions for productive SME development, which can further contribute to economic development and job creation in both the underdeveloped and the rising areas in this subregion...|$|R

40|$|The {{explosive}} growth of incubation {{has seen a}} concurrent and significant increase in research on {{and knowledge of the}} incubation phenomenon. However, instead of comprehensively differentiating between non-profit and for-profit incubators, research has described a whole array of partly overlapping archetypes, thus missing out on important aspects. This article first offers two arguments validating a framework of what non-profit university incubators can learn from for-profit corporate incubators before presenting the framework itself. While corporate incubators are for-profit organizations with which to enhance a corporation’s technology development, university incubators try to leverage technological insights from the university in a similar manner. In accordance with their respective missions, organizational structures, incubator processes and resource flows, it is possible to transfer lessons learned from two corporate incubator archetypes—the fast-profit incubator and leveraging incubator—to the world of university incubator. Our empirical findings are based on in-depth case studies of 25 companies through 52 semi-structured interviews with managers of corporate incubators of large technology-intensive corporations in Europe and the U. S., two EU incubator benchmarking surveys and five interviews with the heads of technology transfer offices of two top technology universities.

40|$|Romania, as {{a country}} with a low R&D level, in order to {{converge}} to the living standards of western economies, is doomed to foster private investments in applied research and experimental development. Thus, it is critical to study what are the main objectives for innovation at organizational level. This paper investigates the most important objectives for innovation in Romania and in the European Union, aiming to find out what are the main challenges innovative enterprises have to face. The general approach is focused on the analysis of the frequency with which these objectives occur, both at general and structural levels. Therefore we have extracted the most important three highly important objectives for innovation, both in Romania and EU: improving the quality of goods or services, the need to increase the range of goods or services and the entering new markets or increase the market share. All these three are positively correlated with the size (number of employees) of the organization. One of our findings underlines that there are fewer objectives in EU then in Romania, both at general and structural levels. Such a situation suggesting that the differences derive from two main sources: Romania has more needs, thus the enterprises target more goals, and {{there is a lack of}} managerial know-how that leads to non-prioritized objectives for innovation. Also, we identified an asymmetry, consisting in the fact that in EU, medium sized enterprises are more likely to act as the small ones, as opposed to the Romanian context. R&D and innovation component should be in the center of the Romanian strategy for convergence and competitiveness strengthening, treating differently the SMEs in order to foster innovation in a sustainable manner, through the encouragement of private enterprises to engage in partnerships for R&D an innovation. Also there is a critical need for governmental intervention in building facilities for the modern business infrastructures (business <b>incubators,</b> <b>industrial</b> parks, clusters, and competitive poles), creating a viable VC market for innovative projects, stimulating the creation of new SMEs and fostering internationalization of the local enterprises...|$|R
50|$|Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan {{are also}} {{building}} technology parks {{as part of}} their drive to modernize infrastructure. In 2011, construction began of a technopark in the village of Bikrova near Ashgabat, the Turkmen capital. It will combine research, education, <b>industrial</b> facilities, business <b>incubators</b> and exhibition centres. The technopark will house research on alternative energy sources (sun, wind) and the assimilation of nanotechnologies. Between 2010 and 2012, technological parks were set up in the east, south and north Kazakhstan oblasts (administrative units) and in the capital, Astana. A Centre for Metallurgy was also established in the east Kazakhstan oblast, as well as a Centre for Oil and Gas Technologies which {{will be part of the}} planned Caspian Energy Hub. In addition, the Centre for Technology Commercialization has been set up in Kazakhstan as part of the Parasat National Scientific and Technological Holding, a joint stock company established in 2008 that is 100% state-owned. The centre supports research projects in technology marketing, intellectual property protection, technology licensing contracts and start-ups. The centre plans to conduct a technology audit in Kazakhstan and to review the legal framework regulating the commercialization of research results and technology.Countries are seeking to augment the efficiency of traditional extractive sectors but also to make greater use of information and communication technologies and other modern technologies, such as solar energy, to develop the business sector, education and research. In March 2013, two research institutes were created by presidential decree to foster the development of alternative energy sources in Uzbekistan, with funding from the Asian Development Bank and other institutions: the SPU Physical−Technical Institute (Physics Sun Institute) and the International Solar Energy Institute. Three universities have been set up since 2011 to foster competence in strategic economic areas: Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan (first intake in 2011), an international research university, Inha University in Uzbekistan (first intake in 2014), specializing in information and communication technologies, and the International Oil and Gas University in Turkmenistan (founded in 2013). Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are both generalizing the teaching of foreign languages at school, in order to facilitate international ties. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have both adopted the three-tier bachelor’s, master’s and PhD degree system, in 2007 and 2012 respectively, which is gradually replacing the Soviet system of Candidates and Doctors of Science. In 2010, Kazakhstan became the only Central Asian member of the Bologna Process, which seeks to harmonize higher education systems in order to create a European Higher Education Area.|$|R
40|$|Uganda’s {{economy is}} agro-based; {{although}} {{the country is}} land locked it has great potential for industrial development. It is well endowed with natural resources and salubrious climate, but with little success in transforming its agricultural and mineral wealth into processed commodities for local, regional and international markets. The Uganda’s National Development Plan 2010 - 2014 and Uganda Vision 2040 call for a transformed Ugandan society from a peasant to a modern and prosperous country within 30 years. To achieve this goal, Ugandan economy needs to be industrialized. This need {{is one of the}} identified strategic bottlenecks. Various strategies and action plans have been developed to steer the country’s economy towards sustainable development and increased competitiveness but with little success. It has been recognized globally that economic development depends heavily on small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs are the prime source of new jobs and {{play a crucial role in}} income generation as well as in industrialization processes. However, most small businesses fail within their early stages of operation mainly due to under-capitalization and / or lack of proper management and business skills. Globally, through business incubators, start-ups and SMEs have been significantly enhanced to overcome their initial and critical stages of development. Business incubators have been tried in Uganda but not in a successful way. An Open Innovation Business Incubator is a physical or virtual environment that combines the attributes of open innovation and business incubation concepts in creating and supporting new start-ups. This research aimed at understanding more of the situation in Uganda, how the innovation systems and incubators are managed in other countries and to design a model for how to create better conditions for incubators in Uganda and similar low-income countries and stimulate industrial development. The proposed model has adopted an open innovation approach and a list of suggestions and recommendations has been made. Different methodological tools and participatory approaches were utilized in the process of undertaking the study to achieve the objectives. Data were collected through literature review, analysis of relevant theories such as industrialization, entrepreneurship, science, technology and innovation, business incubation, triple helix and clusters theory, open innovation, and public private partnerships. Review of Government reports and policy documents, discussions with industrial and incubation experts, surveys, focus group discussions and case studies were done. Useful ideas were obtained from seminars and conferences. Research findings indicated that: • There are hardly any graduate incubatees in Uganda, thus there is a need to foster partnerships and synergies between government, private sector/non-government organizations and academia for open incubation, • All incubators in Uganda focus on incubatees developing technologies and products but not on business models, • Open innovation incubators combined with entrepreneurial oriented strategies can effectively support start-ups and SMEs but requires strong mutual trust amongst actors, • Through public-private partnerships and open innovation <b>incubators,</b> <b>industrial</b> transformation can be stimulated...|$|R
