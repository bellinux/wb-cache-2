5|$|Culturally, the {{campaign}} captured the public imagination in Britain and France: the Battle of Grand Port {{is the only}} naval battle that appears on the Arc de Triomphe, while in Britain Rowley and Bertie were both made baronets <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>services</b> in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Kingdoms—roughly {{the size}} of commanderies—were ruled {{exclusively}} by the emperor's male relatives as semi-autonomous fiefdoms. Before 157 BC some kingdoms were ruled by non-relatives, granted to them in return <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>services</b> to Emperor Gaozu. The administration of each kingdom was {{very similar to that}} of the central government. Although the emperor appointed the Chancellor of each kingdom, kings appointed all the remaining civil officials in their fiefs.|$|E

5|$|On September 19, Grant's army {{defeated}} Confederates at the Battle of Iuka, then successfully defended Corinth, inflicting heavy casualties. On October 25, Grant assumed {{command of}} the District of the Tennessee. In November, after Lincoln's preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, Grant ordered units under his command to incorporate former slaves into the Union Army, giving them clothes, shelter and wages <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E
5|$|Women {{are active}} and play key roles in {{organizing}} activities and administering {{them in the}} Church. Female office holders are always head of groups of women and not groups of men.

5|$|Lejoille's {{published}} {{account of}} the action greatly exaggerated the scale of his success, and, although he was highly praised in the French press, he was castigated in Britain for his conduct. Thompson, Berry {{and most of the}} British officers were exchanged and acquitted at court martial, and the captains were knighted <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>services,</b> while Leander and many of the crew were recaptured in March 1799 by a Russian squadron that seized Corfu, and returned to British control by order of Tsar Paul. Généreux survived another year in the Mediterranean, but was eventually captured off Malta in 1800 by a British squadron under Lord Nelson.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was now precarious and violence appeared likely as the rebels prepared to unleash a volley of arrows. Richard rode forwards towards {{the crowd and}} persuaded them to follow him away from Smithfields, to Clerkenwell Fields, defusing the situation. Walworth meanwhile began {{to regain control of}} the situation, backed by reinforcements from the city. Tyler's head was cut off and displayed on a pole and, with their leader dead and the royal government now backed by the London militia, the rebel movement began to collapse. Richard promptly knighted Walworth and his leading supporters <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{coincide}} with the 60th anniversary of the Ballon d'Or in 2016, France Football published a reevaluation of the awards presented before 1995, when only European players were eligible to win the award. 12 out of the 39 Ballons d'Or presented during this time period would have been awarded to South American players; in addition to Pelé and Diego Maradona, Garrincha, Mario Kempes, and Romário were retrospectively recognized as worthy winners. The original recipients, however, remain unchanged. Maradona and Pelé received honorary Ballons d'Or <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>services</b> to football in 1996 and 2013, respectively.|$|E

5|$|After {{decades of}} upheavals and rebellions mounted by Arab tribes in the Middle East, the Ottomans {{attempted}} to reassert centralized {{control over the}} Arab vilayets. In 1657, they sent an expeditionary force led mostly by Arab sipahi officers from central Syria to reassert Ottoman authority in Nablus and its hinterland, {{as part of a}} broader attempt to established centralized rule throughout the empire at that time. In return <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>services,</b> the officers were granted agricultural lands around the villages of Jabal Nablus. The Ottomans, fearing that the new Arab land holders would establish independent bases of power, dispersed the land plots to separate and distant locations within Jabal Nablus to avoid creating contiguous territory controlled by individual clans. Contrary to its centralization purpose, the 1657 campaign allowed the Arab sipahi officers to establish their own increasingly autonomous foothold in Nablus. The officers raised their families there and intermarried with the local notables of the area, namely the ulama and merchant families. Without abandoning their nominal military service, they acquired diverse properties to consolidate their presence and income such as soap and pottery factories, bathhouses, agricultural lands, grain mills and, olive and sesame oil presses.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} rising {{importance}} of a central administration arose {{a new class of}} educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>services.</b> Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration. As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150BC, is assumed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed an {{agreement}} known as the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit spending and debt levels. Some EU member states, including Greece and Italy, were able to circumvent these rules and mask their deficit and debt levels {{through the use of}} complex currency and credit derivatives structures. The structures were designed by prominent US investment banks, who received substantial fees in return <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>services</b> and who took on little credit risk themselves thanks to special legal protections for derivatives counterparties. Financial reforms within the U.S. since the financial crisis have only served to reinforce special protections for derivatives—including greater access to government guarantees—while minimising disclosure to broader financial markets.|$|E
5|$|On 31 December, the {{battered}} Vénus docked in Rivière Noire and Stewart and his men, {{who had never}} {{had an opportunity to}} seize their freedom, were marched to Port Louis, where they witnessed the arrival of Manche, accompanied by Créole, Charlton and United Kingdom on 1 January 1810. <b>For</b> <b>their</b> <b>services,</b> Stewart and his fellow prisoners were later released and allowed to sail to the Cape of Good Hope. There they discovered Windham, which had failed to arrive at Île de France. Although her prize crew had retained control of the ship following the storm, they had been sighted, chased and seized within sight of Île de France on 29 December by the newly arrived British frigate HMS Magicienne under Captain Lucius Curtis. Bellone and her prizes arrived at Port Louis on 2 January, having slipped past Rowley's blockade during a period of calm weather.|$|E
5|$|Slaves (nuli 奴隸) {{comprised}} roughly 1% of the population, {{a proportion}} {{far less than}} the contemporary Greco-Roman world which relied on the labor of a large slave population. Slaves were classified into two categories: those who were privately owned, and those who were owned by the state. Privately owned slaves were often former peasants who fell into debt and sold themselves into slavery, while others were former government slaves bestowed to nobles and high officials as rewards <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>services.</b> State-owned slaves were sometimes prisoners of war (yet not all were made slaves). However, most slaves were tributary gifts given to the court by foreign states, families of criminals who committed treason against the state, and former private slaves who were either donated to authorities (since this would exempt the former slaveholder from labor obligations) or confiscated by the state if their master had broken a law. In both Western and Eastern Han, arrested criminals became convicts and it was only during the reign of Wang Mang that counterfeiting criminals were made into slaves.|$|E

5|$|The French counter-attacked and {{recapture}}d Guadeloupe on 2 June 1794. Jervis and Grey {{landed a}} force to recapture the island but were repulsed by the reinforced French garrison and the British expedition withdrew. In November 1794 Admiral Benjamin Caldwell replaced Jervis. Disputes over prize money were widely held as the reason that Jervis and Grey were not awarded peerages for their service. Grey and Jervis' enemies proposed a vote of censure against the General and Admiral. The vote itself was negative. The prize money for the capture of the three islands, when finally calculated, amounted to £70,000 that {{was due to the}} officers and men of the navy. If adjusted for inflation this would equal approximately £ as of 20. Jervis and Grey were however awarded the thanks of both Houses of Parliament <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>services.</b> On 12 April 1794 Jervis was promoted vice-admiral of the white.|$|E
5|$|The academy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{expensive}} in Europe, operating at a cost of £5million a year. The main cost is the dormitory, La Masia itself. The minimum age for the youth program is six years; each year, more than 1,000boys from the ages of six to eight try out for admittance. The best 200 are selected. The club also actively seeks for prospective students; it employs a system in which 15scouts are deployed in Catalonia, 15 in the rest of Spain and 10 scattered throughout the world. To alleviate the expenses of this scouting, the club has an agreement with 15 local clubs for them to train players who are not ready for entry into the youth academy. In return, FC Barcelona gives money, coaching and technical advice to these clubs <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>services.</b> While expanding its operations abroad, the club established five schools in Mexico and one in Egypt; successful applicants to these schools become full-time students, receiving academic education and football training.|$|E
5|$|The main {{striking}} {{force of the}} Parthian army was its cataphracts, heavy cavalry with man and horse decked in mailed armor. The cataphracts were equipped with a lance for charging into enemy lines, but were not equipped with bows and arrows which were restricted to horse archers. Due {{to the cost of}} their equipment and armor, cataphracts were recruited from among the aristocratic class who, in return <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>services,</b> demanded a measure of autonomy at the local level from the Arsacid kings. The light cavalry was recruited from among the commoner class and acted as horse archers; they wore a simple tunic and trousers into battle. They used composite bows and were able to shoot at enemies while riding and facing away from them; this technique, known as the Parthian shot, was a highly effective tactic.|$|E
