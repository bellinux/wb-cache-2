25|$|The {{two parts}} of town were divided into encomiendas for a very short time, but in 1537 the {{entirety}} would be declared a city by the Spanish Crown, receiving its coat of arms in 1540. However, {{there is evidence that}} the division of the city was recognized since the early colonial period. The Franciscans established themselves in San Pedro first, with the San Gabriel monastery because this was the power center of the city and at first the monks were not sufficient to be spread out around the entire city. This early emphasis on the San Pedro side, along with the settling of the Spanish population almost exclusively here, resulted in this side of the city becoming mixed race (mestizo) early in the colonial era. Evidence of political distinctions can be found as early as 1548, but in 1714, the two halves were definitely separated when San Andrés was made an Indian Republic. This separation would cause political and economic problems between the two halves of the city, but still coexisting in matters of religion. The two municipalities were established by 1861. However, the two halves never completely split and the two municipalities formed a partial union called the Distrito Cholula de Rivadavia in 1895, with the appendage in honor of Bernardino de Rivadavia. As such, San Pedro <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is the oldest continuously inhabited city in the Americas.|$|E
