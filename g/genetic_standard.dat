40|$|Returns {{from the}} {{utilization}} of genetic markers in breeding programs have been computed in two ways. In the first approach, returns accrue from additionally improved milk yield that was due to marker utilization in selection. In the second approach, changes in returns from semen sales for a breeding organization operating in a competitive market are determined. The genetic effect of markers is taken to result from preselection of young bulls. Based on the literature, the increase in mean breeding value of young bulls {{as a result of}} marker-based preselection was taken to range from. 15 to. 45 additive <b>genetic</b> <b>standard</b> deviation. When additive <b>genetic</b> <b>standard</b> deviation is assumed at $ 67 with an interest rate of 5 % and a time horizon of 25 yr, cumulative discounted returns from 1 yr of marker utilization ranged from $ 7 to $ 21 per cow for progeny testing and from $ 20 to $ 60 for an open nucleus. Additional discounted financial returns from increased semen sales range from $ 5. 0 million to $ 16. 2 million for a situation in which an AI firm utilizes markers during 20 yr and competitors do not follow. Lower costs are expected as technology improves, and improved statistical analysis should reduce the number of typings required.

The objectives of this study were to compare genomic breeding values (GEBV) of the continuous with the routine genomic evaluation systems and to investigate the effect of genotype imputation on genomic predictions of embryos. A total of 2440 animals genotyped with Illumina 50 K, LD and EuroG 10 K chips were available between March and April 2014 for comparing genomic evaluations between the two systems. Average differences for all 44 evaluated traits ranged from- 4 % to 1 % <b>genetic</b> <b>standard</b> deviations for direct genomic values (DGV) and from- 10 % to 5 % <b>genetic</b> <b>standard</b> deviations for GEBV. Depending on the traits, correlations of DGV between the two systems were above 0. 995, 0. 992, and 0. 988 for animals genotyped with 50 K, EuroG 10 K and LD chips, respectively. GEBV correlations exceeded 0. 98 for all the traits across all the chip types. Due to the genotype imputing step, DGV variances of embryos increased, on average, by 2 % to 7 % of total additive genetic variance and about half of the variance increase was attributed to Mendelian sampling.

40|$|Quantitative genetic {{analysis}} was performed on 10, 919 data records collected over three generations from the selection programme for increased body weight at harvest in red tilapia (Oreochromis spp.). They were offspring of 224 sires and 226 dams (50 sires and 60 dams per generation, on average). Linear mixed models were used to analyse body traits (weight, length, width and depth), whereas threshold generalised models assuming probit distribution were employed to examine genetic inheritance of survival rate, sexual maturity and body colour. The estimates of heritability for traits studied (body weight, standard length, body width, body depth, body colour, early sexual maturation and survival) across statistical models were moderate to high (0. 13 – 0. 45). Genetic correlations among body traits and survival were high and positive (0. 68 – 0. 96). Body length and width exhibited negative genetic correlations with body colour (− 0. 47 to − 0. 25). Sexual maturity was genetically correlated positively with measurements of body traits (weight and length). Direct and correlated genetic responses to selection were measured as estimated breeding values in each generation and expressed in <b>genetic</b> <b>standard</b> deviation units (σG). The cumulative improvement achieved for harvest body weight was 1. 72 σG after three generations or 12. 5 % per generation when the gain was expressed {{as a percentage of}} the base population.

40|$|Abstract Background Genomic {{selection}} {{has become}} an important tool in the genetic improvement of animals and plants. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the impacts of breeding value estimation method, reference population structure, and trait genetic architecture, on long-term response to genomic selection without updating marker effects. Methods Three methods were used to estimate genomic breeding values: a BLUP method with relationships estimated from genome-wide markers (GBLUP), a Bayesian method, and a partial least squares regression method (PLSR). A shallow (individuals from one generation) or deep reference population (individuals from five generations) was used with each method. The effects of the different selection approaches were compared under four different genetic architectures for the trait under selection. Selection was based on one of the three genomic breeding values, on pedigree BLUP breeding values, or performed at random. Selection continued for ten generations. Results Differences in long-term selection response were small. For a genetic architecture with a very small number of three to four quantitative trait loci (QTL), the Bayesian method achieved a response that was 0. 05 to 0. 1 <b>genetic</b> <b>standard</b> deviation higher than other methods in generation 10. For genetic architectures with approximately 30 to 300 QTL, PLSR (shallow reference) or GBLUP (deep reference) had an average advantage of 0. 2 <b>genetic</b> <b>standard</b> deviation over the Bayesian method in generation 10. GBLUP resulted in 0. 6 % and 0. 9 % less inbreeding than PLSR and BM and on average a one third smaller reduction of genetic variance. Responses in early generations were greater with the shallow reference population while long-term response was not affected by reference population structure. Conclusions The ranking of estimation methods was different with than without selection. Under selection, applying GBLUP led to lower inbreeding and a smaller reduction of genetic variance while a similar response to selection was achieved. The reference population structure had a limited effect on long-term accuracy and response. Use of a shallow reference population, most closely related to the selection candidates, gave early benefits while in later generations, when marker effects were not updated, the estimation of marker effects based on a deeper reference population did not pay off. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Some {{analytical}} and simulated criteria {{were used to}} determine whether a priori genetic differences among groups, which are not accounted for by the relationship matrix, ought to be fitted in models for genetic evaluation, depending on the data structure and the accuracy of the evaluation. These criteria were the mean square error of some extreme contrasts between animals, the true genetic superiority of animals selected across groups, i. e. the selection response, and the magnitude of selection bias (difference between true and predicted selection responses). The different statistical models studied considered either fixed or random genetic groups (based on six different years of birth) versus ignoring the genetic group effects in a sire model. Including fixed genetic groups led to an overestimation of selection response under BLUP selection across groups despite the unbiasedness of the estimation, i. e. despite the correct estimation of differences between genetic groups. This overestimation was extremely important in numerical applications which considered two kinds of within-station progeny test designs for French purebred beef cattle AI sire evaluation across years: the reference sire design and the repeater sire design. When assuming a priori genetic differences due to the existence of a genetic trend of around 20 % of <b>genetic</b> <b>standard</b> deviation for a trait with h 2 = 0. 4, in a repeater sire design, the overestimation of the genetic superiority of bulls selected across groups varied from about 10 % for an across-year selection rate p = 1 / 6 and an accurate selection index (100 progeny records per sire) to 75 % for p = 1 / 2 and a less accurate selection index (20 progeny records per sire). This overestimation decreased when the genetic trend, the heritability of the trait, the accuracy of the evaluation or the connectedness of the design increased. Whatever the data design, a model of genetic evaluation without groups was preferred to a model with genetic groups when the genetic trend was in the range of likely values in cattle breeding programs (0 to 20 % of <b>genetic</b> <b>standard</b> deviation). In such a case, including random groups was pointless and including fixed groups led to a large overestimation of selection response, smaller true selection response across groups and larger variance of estimation of the differences between groups. Although the genetic trend was correctly predicted by a model fitting fixed genetic groups, important errors in predicting individual breeding values led to incorrect ranking of animals across groups and, consequently, led to lower selection response. </p...|$|E

Estimation of variance components, ordinary breeding values, and vEBV was performed using standard variance component estimation software (ASReml), applying the methodology for double hierarchical generalized linear models. Estimation using ASReml took less than 7 d on a Linux server. The <b>genetic</b> <b>standard</b> deviations for residual variance were 0. 21 and 0. 22 for somatic cell score and milk yield, respectively, which indicate moderate genetic variance for residual variance and imply that a standard deviation change in vEBV for one of these traits would alter the residual variance by 20 %.
