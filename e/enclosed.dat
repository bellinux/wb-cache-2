5|$|Parliamentary {{enclosures}} {{accounted for}} about 4.5 million acres {{of what had been}} open fields, not counting the enclosure of common land and wild 'waste'. In 1700 roughly half England's arable land was already enclosed; {{by the end of the}} enclosure process, almost all of it was. The revolution in the landscape began in about 1750, affecting about 3,000 parishes, especially in the English midlands. Between 1760 and 1800 there were 1,479 enclosure acts, covering 2.5 million acres; another 1.5 million acres were <b>enclosed</b> by 1844, by more than a thousand further acts. Some counties such as Kent, Essex and Devon were little affected, having largely been <b>enclosed</b> much earlier, often directly from forest or moorland. Many miles of new straight hedgerows were laid to mark out the newly <b>enclosed</b> fields of the midlands; in some areas such as Derbyshire, straight limestone walls were used instead. Many straight new roads were created at the same time. Farmhouses remained in the old villages at first, but new red-brick Victorian ones were often built in the middle of their now <b>enclosed</b> land in due course.|$|E

50|$|In any {{vacuum region}} of space-time, all {{components}} of the Ricci tensor must be zero. This demonstrates that <b>enclosing</b> any amount of vacuum will not change our volume integral. It also means that our volume integral will be constant for any <b>enclosing</b> surface, {{as long as we}} <b>enclose</b> all of the gravitating mass inside our surface. Because Stokes theorem guarantees that our surface integral is equal to the above volume integral, our surface integral will also be independent of the <b>enclosing</b> surface as long as the surface <b>encloses</b> all of the gravitating mass.|$|R
