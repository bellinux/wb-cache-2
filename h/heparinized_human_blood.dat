This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract During surgical procedures, abdominal swabs are routinely used to adsorb {{blood from the}} operation field and for the retention of tissues and organs. Due to the material characteristics, abdominal swabs exhibit a slight procoagulant activity, which is usually desirable and mostly harmless. However, during cardiac surgery with heart–lung machine (HLM) support, abnormal clot for-mation may result in life-threatening thromboembolic complications. Therefore, a simple clotting test (SCT) al-lowing in vitro detection of abdominal swabs with elevated hypercoagulant potency {{in the presence of}} <b>heparinized</b> <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> was developed and validated.

SUMMARY and EXPLANATION This test kit allows the quantitative determination of basophil degranulation in <b>heparinized</b> <b>human</b> whole <b>blood.</b> It contains the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) as positive control, important allergens, a two-colour antibody reagent {{for assessing the}} activation of human basophilic granulocytes and necessary reagents. It determines the percentage of basophilic granulocytes which have degranulated after incubation with allergen or fMLP. The evaluation of basophil degranulation should be performed by flow cytometry. The detailed instructions result from specific experience and validation assays. Critical steps are in bold letters. A graphic summary of the test is attached. APPLICATIONS BASOTEST is intended for investigation of allergen induced activation of basophilic granulocytes.

For as long as 26 hours following exposure, potassium is progressively lost from the cells and quantitatively replaced by sodium with little, if any, osmotic disturbance. The mean rate of loss at 20, 000 r and 24 °C. is about 0. 4 per cent of the initial cell potassium per hour and approximately doubles for a 20, 000 r increase. It is accentuated if blood is stored at low temperature (5 °C.) following radiation exposure. Isotope experiments show {{that the rate of}} entrance of potassium into the cells is practically unaltered, the principal effect being an acceleration of the rate from cells to plasma. This suggests that radiation may have interfered with a mechanism of selective potassium accumulation based on preferential retention of the element. The sodium which enters the cells following irradiation contributes to the rapidly exchanging portion of the cellular sodium, suggesting that this fraction is ionic sodium...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate electrolysis-related changes of blood as a potential cause of thromboembolic complications associated with GDC use. METHODS: For in vitro observations, 15 GDCs (10 conventional coils and five insulated coils) were experimentally detached under microscopic observation. Three coils were detached in normal saline, five in human serum, and seven in <b>heparinized</b> <b>human</b> <b>blood.</b> For animal experiments, two coils were detached in two canine normal common carotid arteries with systemic heparinization. Immediately after detachment, the arteries were exposed, and clot formations were observed. RESULTS: Significant amounts of gas bubbles were observed in all in vitro observations; more were seen in conventional coils, which required longer detachment times, than in insulated coils. Gas generation started with the growth of tiny bubbles into larger ones. In insulated coils, gas was generated only at the detachment zone, and no difference between saline, serum, and blood environments was observed. During detachment within heparinize...|$|E

Utilizing a flow cytometry-based technique, we have investigated the phagocytosis of M+ group A streptococci by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in <b>heparinized</b> <b>human</b> peripheral whole <b>blood.</b> Intracellular labeling of streptococci with a nontoxic fluorescent dye allowed us to quantify the association and phagocytosis of M+ streptococci by PMNs in whole blood in {{the presence or absence}} of C 5 a, a physiologically important chemotactic activator of PMNs. We found that wild-type strains of group A streptococci that are resistant to phagocytosis (determined by the classical Lancefield method) readily associate with C 5 a-activated whole-blood PMNs. In the absence of opsonizing M-type-specific antibodies, the M+ streptococci associated with PMNs are phagocytized and killed. In addition, blockade of the β 2 integrin, CD 11 b/CD 18, with anti-human CD 11 b monoclonal antibody inhibited association between M+ streptococci and C 5 a-activated PMNs. These findings establish a new relationship between M+ streptococci and PMNs, in which C 5 a-activated PMNs have the capacity to kill M+ streptococci in whole blood through a receptor-mediated phagocytic mechanism...|$|R

Microvessels with diameters of 50, 100, and 400 mu m were constructed in a scattering phantom. Perfusion was simulated by pumping <b>heparinized</b> <b>human</b> whole <b>blood</b> at five velocities (0 to 20 mm/s). Vessel diameter and blood flow velocity were assessed with LSCI, OCT, and SDF. Quantification of vessel diameter was feasible with OCT and SDF. LSCI could only visualize the 400 -mu m vessel, perfusion units scaled nonlinearly with blood velocity. OCT could assess blood flow velocity in terms of inverse OCT speckle decorrelation time. SDF was not feasible to measure blood flow; however, for diluted blood the measurements were linear with the input velocity up to 1 mm/s. LSCI, OCT, and SDF were feasible to visualize blood flow.

This model system was applied to study various fields of drug development. Materials and Methods. <b>Heparinized</b> <b>human</b> whole <b>blood</b> was incubated with drugs for less than 4 h. The changes of specific mRNA were then quantified using the method we developed (Mitsuhashi, Tomozawa, Endo, and Shinagawa, Clin Chem 52 : 634 – 642, 2006). Results. The mRNA quantitation method {{was used as a}} model system to study the following areas: (1) identification of respondents and non-respondents, (2) ex vivo compound screening, (3) determination of individually optimized doses, (4) drug-to-drug comparison, (5) assessment of leukocyte toxicity, (6) discovery of molecular targets, (7) assessment of the action of dietary supplements, and (8) characterization of respondents and non-respondents for various dietary supplements. Conclusion. Since ex vivo assays are safe, a large number of healthy donors and disease patients can be recruited to identify individual-to-individual variations, which is not available from current preclinical study models. Although each system should be validated using a large number of samples, the ex vivo analysis will be a new tool for the development of drugs and dietary supplements in future.

Phosphodiesterase type 4 is the predominant phosphodiesterase isozyme in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and {{plays a key role in}} the regulation of polymorphonuclear leukocyte activation. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of rolipram, a selective phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor, on the functional changes of polymorphonuclear leukocytes by using simulated extracorporeal circulation. Methods: Simulated extracorporeal circulation was established by recirculating <b>heparinized</b> <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> for 120 minutes on a membrane oxygenator with and without 10 μmol/L rolipram. F-actin content and L-selectin and CD 11 b expression of polymorphonuclear leukocytes were measured by means of flow cytometry. Polymorphonuclear leukocyte deformability was evaluated with a microchannel array flow analyzer that had a similar diameter as the capillaries. Polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase was measured with an enzyme immunoassay. Results: Rolipram reduced the increase of F-actin content of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the increase of transit time of 100 μL of blood sample through a microchannel. Rolipram reduced the increase of CD 11 b expression and the decrease of L-selectin expression of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Rolipram reduced the release of elastase from polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Conclusion: Rolipram inhibited the deformability change mediated by F-actin assembly, the changes in adhesion molecules, and the release of elastase from activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes in simulated extracorporeal circulation.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Presumed {{differences}} in the thrombolytic activity and fibrinolytic specificity of the three commonly used thrombolytic agents, streptokinase, urokinase, and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), are based on clinical study results, where variability renders meaningful comparisons difficult. An in vitro model of catheter-directed venous thrombolysis {{was used to compare}} the three agents. Methods: Retracted iodine 125 – radiolabeled clots that simulate those observed in the venous system were infused with thrombolytic agents at doses analogous to those used clinically. Perfusion with <b>heparinized,</b> whole <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> was undertaken for 60 minutes, measuring the efficacy of thrombolysis through serial quantification of radio tracer released into the circuit. Fibrinolytic specificity was determined by following decrements in perfusate fibrinogen concentration. Results: Streptokinase was the agent associated with the slowest rate of clot lysis (p = 0. 01 vs urokinase and rt-PA). Urokinase was associated with an intermediate rate of lysis but appeared to be the agent with the greatest degree of fibrinolytic specificity (p = 0. 02 vs streptokinase, p = 0. 05 vs rt-PA). Although rt-PA was associated with improved efficacy early in the perfusions, the differences between rt-PA and urokinase dissipated after 30 minutes. Conclusions: These laboratory observations suggest that urokinase may be the most appropriate agent for catheter-directed venous thrombolysis, offering an advantageous compromise between fibrinolytic specificity and thrombolytic speed.

40|$|The {{association}} of Streptococcus suis types 1 and 2 with meningitis in pigs {{has been the}} subject of previous communications (1, 2). Alternatively designated group S (type 1) and group R (type 2) (3), these streptococci have attracted renewed attention because type 2 has been identified as a cause of meningitis in man, particularly in men whose employment brings them into association with pigs (4). S. suis constitutes a subgroup in Lancefield's serological group D (1). In this subgroup, two serological types, types 1 and 2, are distinguishable by the immunological specificity of a component thought to be a capsular polysaccharide (2). In bactericidal tests, well capsulated strains grow readily in <b>heparinized</b> porcine and <b>human</b> <b>blood.</b> Such growth is inhibited by phagocytosis in the presence of typespecific antibody directed against the capsule (5). It was, therefore, of interest to determine whether vaccination with capsular polysaccharide would elicit the production of type-specific antibodies in pigs. If this were so, such vaccination might protect against infection with homologous streptococci...|$|R
40|$|Background: Stent {{thrombosis}} and restenosis are {{of great}} clinical significance. We constructed a closed loop in vitro <b>heparinized</b> whole <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> circulation model for testing hemocompatibility of coronary stents, This model allows evaluation of <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> activation by blood-stent interaction in a well-controlled setting, Until now these interactions were {{studied in the}} highly coagulable pig coronary artery model. Methods: We evaluated activation of the coagulation system and blood components by uncoated, heparin-coated, and silicon-carbide coated tantalum stents, The effects, measured by biochemical assays, were compared with stainless-steel stents, Also the inhibitory effect on platelet activation by indomethacin equal to the oral effect of 325 mg acetylsalicylic acid daily, was measured and visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Results: Both activation of the coagulation system and platelets were counteracted by indomethacin, suggesting an important role for platelets in activation of the coagulation system in this model. Despite platelet activation by all stents, the SiC-coated tantalum stent demonstrates a significantly lower GpIIIa receptor-mediated platelet adhesion at the stent surface (21. 7 X 10 (3) counts per second/mg stent weight) compared to all other stents (stainless-steel 54. 0, heparin-coated 95. 7 and uncoated 76. 2 X 10 (3) cps/mg). Also activated leukocytes demonstrated a significantly loner CD 11 b receptor-mediated adhesion at the SiC-coated stent (37. 0 X 10 (3) cps/mg) than at the stainless-steel stent (114. 5 X 10 (3) cps/mg). Conclusions: Data from this in, vitro circulation study show a significantly lower platelet and leukocyte adhesion at {{the surface of the}} SiC-coated tantalum stent than at the surface of stainless-steel stents or uncoated and heparin-coated tantalum stents...|$|R
40|$|Poly(2 -methoxyethylacrylate) (PMEA) {{is a new}} coating {{material}} that appears to reduce protein and platelet adsorption. However, the exact performance of PMEA coated circuit remains to be revealed in well-controlled experiments. Therefore, we compared its hemocompatibility with covalent-bound heparin-, and non-coated circuits during 6 hours of in vitro circulation, using donor blood from six volunteers. In our model, simple tubing circuits containing one-way ball valve {{were placed on the}} rotary table, which moved alternatively to generate pulsatile recirculation of <b>heparinized</b> <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> inside the tubing. Using this model, we expected fine assessment of the material surface, because we could reduce blood damage by avoiding air and a blood pump. Moreover, the small capacity of circuit allowed us to compare three kinds of circuits using a single unit of donor blood, eliminating effects by possible variations between blood donors. The anti-thrombin capacity of the PMEA-coated circuits was maintained even after six hours blood circulation, whereas surface thrombin generation increased markedly after use in non-coated circuits (P < 0. 05). Deposition of fibrin onto PMEA circuits was reduced more than 30 % compared with heparin and non-coated circuits (P < 0. 05). However, the increase of plasma Factor XIIa was similar in all circuits. Increase of CD 11 b expression on circulating leukocytes and of plasma C 3 a was ameliorated in the heparin- and PMEA-coated circuits (P < 0. 05). PMEA-coated circuits appear to maintain their anti-thrombogenicity during use, otherwise PMEA-coated and heparin-coated circuits showed a similar character in hemocompatibility. This long-standing anti-thrombogenicity might be attributable to less adsorption of activated blood components onto the surface...|$|E
40|$|Because {{passage of}} the {{bacterium}} to blood is a crucial step in the pathogenesis of many group B Streptococcus (GBS) invasive infections, we recently conducted a whole-genome transcriptome analysis during GBS incubation ex vivo with human blood. In the current work, we sought to analyze in detail the difference in GBS gene expression that occurred in one blood sample (donor A) relative to other blood samples. We incubated GBS strain NEM 316 with fresh <b>heparinized</b> <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> obtained from healthy volunteers, and analyzed GBS genome expression and cytokine production. Principal component analysis identified extensive clustering of the transcriptome data among all samples at time 0. In striking contrast, the whole bacterial gene expression in the donor A blood sample was {{significantly different from the}} gene expression in all other blood samples studied, both after 30 and 90 min of incubation. More genes were up-regulated in donor A blood relative to the other samples, at 30 min and 90 min. Furthermore, there was significant variation in transcript levels between donor A blood and other blood samples. Notably, genes with the highest transcript levels in donor A blood were those involved in carbohydrate metabolism. We also discovered an unusual production of proinflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines: MIF, tPAI- 1 and IL- 1 beta were produced at higher levels in donor A blood relative to the other blood samples, whereas GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL- 7 and IL- 10 remained at lower levels in donor A blood. Potential reasons for our observations are that the immune response of donor A significantly influenced the bacterial transcriptome, or both GBS gene expression and immune response were influenced by the metabolic status of donor A...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Dysregulation of the {{coagulation}} system due to inflammatory {{responses and}} cross-species molecular incompatibilities represents {{a major obstacle}} to successful xenotransplantation. We hypothesized that complement inhibition mediated by transgenic expression of human CD 46 in pigs might also regulate the coagulation and fibrinolysis cascades and tested this in ex vivo human-to-pig xenoperfusions. METHODS Forelimbs of wild-type and hCD 46 /HLA-E double transgenic pigs were ex vivo xenoperfused for 12 hours with whole <b>heparinized</b> <b>human</b> <b>blood.</b> Muscle biopsies were stained for galactose-α 1, 3 -galactose, immunoglobulin M, immunoglobulin G, complement, fibrin, tissue factor, fibrinogen-like protein 2, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) - 1. The PAI- 1 /tPA complexes, D-dimers, and prothrombin fragment F 1 + 2 were measured in plasma samples after ex vivo xenoperfusion. RESULTS No differences of galactose expression or deposition of immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G were found in xenoperfused tissues of wild type and transgenic limbs. In contrast, significantly lower deposition of C 5 b- 9 (P < 0. 0001), fibrin (P = 0. 009), and diminished expression of tissue factor (P = 0. 005) and fibrinogen-like protein 2 (P = 0. 028) were found in xenoperfused tissues of transgenic limbs. Levels of prothrombin fragment F 1 + 2 (P = 0. 031) and D-dimers (P = 0. 044) were significantly lower in plasma samples obtained from transgenic as compared to wild-type pig limb perfusions. The expression of the fibrinolytic marker tPA was significantly higher (P = 0. 009), whereas PAI- 1 expression (P = 0. 022) and PAI- 1 /tPA complexes in plasma (P = 0. 015) were lower after transgenic xenoperfusion as compared to wild-type xenoperfusions. CONCLUSIONS In this human-to-pig xenoperfusion model, complement inhibition by transgenic hCD 46 expression led to a significant inhibition of procoagulant and antifibrinolytic pathways...|$|E
40|$|Titanium {{implants}} {{are most}} commonly used for bone augmentation and replacement due to their favorable osseointegration properties. Here, hyperhydrophilic sand-blasted and acid-etched (SBA) titanium surfaces were produced by alkali treatment and their responses to partially <b>heparinized</b> whole <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> were analyzed. Blood clot formation, platelet activation and activation of the complement system was analyzed revealing that exposure time between blood and the material surface is crucial as increasing exposure time results in higher amount of activated platelets, more blood clots formed and stronger complement activation. In contrast, the number of macrophages/monocytes found on alkali-treated surfaces was significantly reduced as compared to untreated SBA Ti surfaces. Interestingly, when comparing untreated to modified SBA Ti surfaces very different blood clots formed on their surfaces. On untreated Ti surfaces blood clots remain thin (below 15 mm), patchy and non-structured lacking large fibrin fiber networks whereas blood clots on differentiated surfaces assemble in an organized and layered architecture of more than 30 mm thickness. Close to the material surface most nucleated cells adhere, above large amounts of non-nucleated platelets remain entrapped within a dense fibrin fiber network providing a continuous cover of the entire surface. These findings might indicate that, combined with findings of previous in vivo studies demonstrating that alkali-treated SBA Ti surfaces perform better in terms of osseointegration, a continuous and structured layer of blood components on the blood-facing surface supports later tissue integration of an endosseous implant...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} (p < 0. 001) {{difference was}} found in the rate of ammonia forma-tion and theamountformed in <b>heparinized</b> dogand <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> at 4 #{ 176 }C. The initial ammonia concentration and the increase in ammonia formation with time were correlated for <b>human</b> <b>blood.</b> This in vitro ammonia formation was not prevented by certain enzyme inhibitors, but it continued after cells and plasma were exhaustively dialyzed against water or saline, sug-gesting that it originates from enzyme action. BLOOD AMMONIA CONCENTRATION increases rap-idly during storage. While studying ammonia metabolism in man and dogs (1, 2), we noticed that the blood ammonia concentration of dogs did not increase as rapidly on storage as did that of <b>human</b> <b>blood.</b> Whemi large amounts of blood are used during blood transfusions the concentration of ammonia in such blood can be critical, especially in patients with cirrhosis undergoing portocaval shunts. The cause of increase in ammonia during storage is not explained. Tobe (3) showed that the concen-tration of ammonia in shed whole blood steadily and spontaneously increased, and that the maxi-mum amount of ammonia was formed after seven days. Both plasma and erythrocytes contributed to this formation. There are compounds present in both plasma and erythrocytes that increase anirnonia in stored blood (4), possibly adenine and adenylic acid derivatives. The addition of a small amount of zinc bromide partially prevented this ammonia in-crease. Itin (5) presented evidence that the ammonia level in blood increased on storage to as much as 790 Mg/i 00 ml. They also indicated that blood transfusions were accompanied by an in-crease in the concentration of ammonia in patient sera. Materials and Methods Heparinized blood submitted to the laboratory for ammonia determination was allowed to stand at 4 #{ 176 }Cbefore blood ammonia was determined after 1, 3, and 7 days. A wide range of blood ammonia concentrations was found. In a similar fashion, hep-arinized blood obtained from dogs used in acute ammonia intoxication experiments was used. (I...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The {{measurement}} of {{reactive oxygen species}} provides a simple method for monitoring the degree of activation of leukocytes in various disorders, and for determining the effects of drugs on this activation. The present report describes the determination of luminol- or lucigenin-amplified chemiluminescence of whole blood in a microtitre plate assay with a 96 -well luminometer (HAMAMATSU MTP reader®). Using <b>heparinized</b> venous <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> from healthy donors, optimal chemiluminescence intensities were determined at a blood dilution of 1 / 100 in a total volume of 0. 25 ml of Hank's balanced salt solution, containing 0. 4 mmol/l luminol as enhancer and either opsonized zymosan (1 g/ 1) or the phorbol ester, 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate (10 ~ 6 mol/l), as stimuli. The in vitro effects of nordihydroguaiaretic acid, diphenylene iodonium, and diclofenac were tested. After preincubation of the diluted whole blood with these drugs for 15 min, the zymosan-stimulated chemiluminescence was diminished in all cases. The specific NADPH oxidase inhibitor, diphenylene iodonium, was most effective (half maximal inhibition at 1. 5 χ 10 ~ 8 mol/ 1), whereas higher concentrations of the antioxidant, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (1. 6 χ 10 ~ 6 mol/ 1), or the non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug, diclofenac (about 10 " 5 mol/ 1), were needed to achieve half maximal inhibition. In addition to its usefulness in the rapid screening of drug effects this assay system {{seems to be very}} beneficial for the clinical diagnosis of congenital disorders. Furthermore, it is suited as an effective and simple metho...|$|R
