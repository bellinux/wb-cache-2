5|$|I have labored {{to make a}} {{covenant}} with myself, that affection may not press upon judgment; for <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>there</b> is no man that hath any apprehension of gentry or nobleness, but his affection stands to the continuance of a house so illustrious, and would take hold of a twig or twine-thread to support it. And yet time hath his revolutions; {{there must be a}} period and an end to all temporal things—finis rerum—an end of names and dignities, and whatsoever is terrene; and why not of de Vere? For where is Bohun? Where is Mowbray? Where is Mortimer? Nay, which is more, and most of all, where is Plantagenet? They are entombed in the urns and sepulchres of mortality! yet let the name of de Vere stand so long as it pleaseth God.|$|E
500|$|Although {{originating}} roughly {{simultaneously in}} Holland, England, and France, {{it was only}} in England, and later in Ireland, that the legend became well known and widely believed. In 1861 Charles Dickens remarked on the longevity of the belief in pig-faced women in England, commenting that [...] "In every age, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> <b>there</b> has been a pig-faced lady".|$|E
500|$|In January 1991, {{following}} her departure from Automatic Dlamini, Harvey formed her own band with former bandmates Rob Ellis and Ian Oliver. Harvey decided {{to name the}} trio PJ Harvey after rejecting other names as [...] "nothing felt right at all or just suggested the wrong type of sound", and also {{to allow her to}} continue music as a solo artist. The trio consisted of Harvey on vocals and guitars, Ellis on drums and backing vocals, and Oliver on bass. Oliver later departed to rejoin the still-active Automatic Dlamini. He was subsequently replaced with Steve Vaughan. The trio's [...] "disastrous" [...] debut performance was held at a skittle alley in Charmouth Village Hall in April 1991. Harvey later recounted the event saying: [...] "we started playing and <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>there</b> was about fifty people there, and during the first song we cleared the hall. There was only about two people left. And a woman came up to us, came up to my drummer, it was only a three piece, while we were playing and shouted at him 'Don't you realize nobody likes you! We'll pay you, you can stop playing, we'll still pay you!'" ...|$|E

500|$|Belle {{was also}} the main {{character}} in various comic books based on the film, including one set during Belle's stay at the castle published by Marvel Comics, and a prequel set several years before the film distributed by Disney Comics. In the former, the storylines generally have the servants trying to coax Belle into doing something with the Beast, only for it to backfire and nearly ruin their friendship before they make up. In the latter serial, Belle ends up {{locked up in a}} cellar by village children after reluctantly playing pirates with them, and later nearly goes down the path leading to Beast's castle. The latter serial also implies that she holds misandric views and refuses to associate herself with the village children, especially the males, due to their not being as well-versed in literature as she."Maurice: You should be playing outside with the other children! // Belle: I'm having a much better time in King Arthur's Court! Sometimes I can see myself living in a castle surrounded by servants. I might even entertain the thought of a handsome prince.....As long as he was gentle and kind... Not like those childish roughnecks in the square! Not one of them could even spell gallant! // Maurice: A day will come when those boys will look like knights in shining armor to you. // Belle: Never! I won't {{have anything to do with}} them. Men are such... such... // Maurice: Hear that, Pierre? According to my daughter there isn't an ounce of difference between us! // Pierre: Oink! // Belle: Well, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>there</b> are some exceptions." ...|$|E
2500|$|As to the radula of this species, it is a {{very small}} and rather obscure object, and only by teasing it to pieces, I could get an idea of the shape of the teeth. The uncini quite cover the median rows, and cross even the uncini of the {{opposite}} side. The rhachidian or median tooth has a subquadrate basal part, with rounded, convex posterior and less convex lateral margins. It has a broad, triangular cusp, with one small median denticle and about 6 smaller ones on each side. The laterals one on each side, have a transversely triangular shape, with an unarmed, arched upper and concave proximal and basal margin, with blunt points at the proximal and distal extremities of the basal margin. On each side I see at least 3, but <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>there</b> are 4 uncini which are long, slender and strongly curved. Though this radula has some resemblance with that of Aporrhais, like Verrill (Mollusca of the New England coast. Transact. Connecticut Acad, of arts and sciences, Vol. VI, May 1884, p. 1S6 and 188) has stated, and like his figure (I.e. pi. 31, fig. 14b) affirms, I cannot agree without doubt with his view that it should be taenioglossate, as the [...] "Siboga"-specimen has a radula with at least 9 rows of teeth and probably 11. The nacreous character of the shell agrees with the Rhipidoglossa, and so does the larger number of uncini. I should think the genus will belong to the Rhipidoglossa with a restricted number of teeth, such as Basilissa. As however only a knowledge of other anatomical particulars, the position and structure of the gills, of the heart etc. can decide the question I have left the family near Trichotropis in accordance with the newest systematic arrangement of Paul Pelseneer (A treatise on Zoology, edited by Ray Lankester, Part V, Mollusca, 1906, p.156) ...|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{fish that}} is still unmentioned, which it is {{scarcely}} advisable to speak about on account of its size, because it will seem to most people incredible. There are only a very few who can speak upon it clearly, because it is seldom near land nor appears where it may be seen by fishermen, and <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>there</b> are not many {{of this sort of}} fish in the sea. Most often in our tongue we call it hafgufa ("kraken" [...] in e.g. Laurence M. Larson's translation). Nor can I conclusively speak about its length in ells, because the times he has shown before men, he has appeared more like land than like a fish. Neither have I heard that one had been caught or found dead; {{and it seems to me}} as though there must be no more than two in the oceans, and I deem that each is unable to reproduce itself, for I believe that they are always the same ones. Then too, neither would it do for other fish if the hafgufa were of such a number as other whales, on account of their vastness, and how much subsistence that they need. It is said to be the nature of these fish that when one shall desire to eat, then it stretches up its neck with a great belching, and following this belching comes forth much food, so that all kinds of fish that are near to hand will come to present location, then will gather together, both small and large, believing they shall obtain their food and good eating; but this great fish lets its mouth stand open the while, and the gap is no less wide than that of a great sound or bight, And nor the fish avoid running together there in their great numbers. But as soon as its stomach and mouth is full, then it locks together its jaws and has the fish all caught and enclosed, that before greedily came there looking for food.|$|E
