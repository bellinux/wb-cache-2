5|$|When {{he learned}} of the complaint, Arafiles spoke with the sheriff of Winkler County, who was his friend {{and one of his}} patients. Arafiles alleged that the nurses' reports to the medical board {{constituted}} harassment. The sheriff investigated and obtained the TMB complaint, which provided enough information about Mitchell and Galle to make them identifiable. Galle and Mitchell were terminated from the hospital and faced criminal charges of misuse of official information. Galle's charges were dropped before trial and Mitchell was acquitted by a jury. In the aftermath of Mitchell's trial, Arafiles, several county officials and a <b>hospital</b> <b>administrator</b> all faced jail time for their roles in the retaliation against the nurses.|$|E

Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) attempts to convince the curmudgeonly Gregory House to treat Adler, but House initially dismisses him, believing that the case would be boring. <b>Hospital</b> <b>administrator</b> Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) approaches House in the elevator and attempts to persuade him to fulfill his duties at the hospital's walk-in clinic, a task House loathes because the cases are usually simplistic. House refuses, claiming that Cuddy cannot fire him due to tenure, and hurriedly leaves. When House's team attempts to perform an MRI on Adler, they discover that House's authorization for diagnostics has been revoked; Cuddy restores his authorization in exchange for his working at the clinic.|$|E

Megan visits her old hospital, where she was once a neurosurgeon.

Whilst at the hospital, Megan meets her old friend and the <b>hospital</b> <b>administrator</b> Gwen Baldwin (Carolyn McCormick) and whilst there Gwen reveals her son died of an overdose.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} expand the demand-control-support (DCS) model to include justice {{perceptions}} and test the utility of this expanded model. The study {{examined the effects of}} the DCS model and multiple types of organizational justice variables (i. e., procedural, distributive, interpersonal, and informational) on indicators of psychological and organizational well-being (i. e., organizational commitment, job satisfaction, psychological distress), specifically among <b>hospital</b> <b>administrators.</b> Questionnaires were completed by 189 administrators working in a medium-sized Australian hospital facility. The utility of expanding the DCS to include justice perceptions was supported by several independent effects of justice; however, the pattern of results differed markedly between the 3 outcomes examined. The main finding {{is that there is a}} U-shaped relationship between job demand and job satisfaction, particularly for <b>hospital</b> <b>administrators</b> who have a high level of support from family and friends, whereby increasing job demands for <b>hospital</b> <b>administrators</b> appears beneficial up to an optimal level. That is, optimally stimulating work that is not overwhelmingly demanding keeps <b>hospital</b> <b>administrators</b> satisfied. The results of this study also highlight the benefit of adding organizational justice to job stress models such as the DCS, and emphasize the importance of testing curvilinear and interaction effects when testing models of job stress. The results indicate that managers of <b>hospital</b> <b>administrators</b> should provide adequate demands that are challenging, yet not overwhelming, to maintain their job satisfaction. Additionally, <b>hospital</b> <b>administrators</b> should be encouraged to develop their social networks outside work and to seek their support when needed...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine and document the hierarchy of job wants as ranked by nurses.
