SCRAP was the first full-court consideration of the American National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

25|$|Conrail began {{turning a}} profit by 1981, {{the result of}} the Staggers Act freedoms and its own {{managerial}} improvements under the leadership of L. Stanley Crane, who had been {{chief executive officer of the}} Southern Railway. While the Staggers Act helped immensely in allowing all railroads to more easily abandon unprofitable rail lines and set its own <b>freight</b> <b>rate,</b> it was under Crane's leadership that Conrail truly became a profitable operation. Soon after Crane took office in 1981 he shed another 4,400 miles from the Conrail system in the following two years, which accounted for only 1% of the railroad's overall traffic and 2% of its profits while saving it millions of dollars in maintenance costs. NERSA relieved Conrail of its requirement to provide commuter service on the Northeast Corridor, further improving its finances.|$|E
25|$|The BC Express began {{a weekly}} round trip service from Fort Gorge to Tête Jaune Cache, {{carrying}} capacity loads of freight and passengers. The passenger fare was $35, meals and berths extra, and the <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> was $80 a ton. This latter seemed quite costly, until the shipper investigated the alternative shipping method, which was shipping his cargo by scow for $70 a ton, with {{no guarantee that}} the shipment would arrive intact, or at all. The risk to scows was mostly at the Grand Canyon, and the deadly whirlpool within it, which was responsible for the loss of at least eighty lives that summer alone, as well as the loss of approximately one in ten scows, and thousands of dollars of merchandise. Needless to say, the BC Express did a brisk business that season, often grossing $12,000 on a single trip. She was the only sternwheeler to offer freight and passenger service to the general public, as the Operator and Conveyor were strictly used for hauling their own workers and supplies needed for rail construction. The BC Express also had a very interesting season in 1913 and many stories of what occurred that summer were told and retold for years afterwards.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is “How did the oil price {{influence}} the <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> for VLCC crude oil tankers between 2005 and 2015 ?” The oil price {{is important for the}} development of world economic activity, as oil is a primary energy source. Given that oil is mainly transported in tankers, the oil price has substantial influence on crude tanker <b>freight</b> <b>rates.</b> The period 2005 - 15 was eventful with large movements in both the oil price and <b>freight</b> <b>rates.</b> The analysis in this thesis is based on a basic supply and demand model, as well as a more specific model of the shipping market developed by the shipping economist, Martin Stopford. The correlation between the oil price and <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> varies across time, and the oil market affects <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> both directly and indirectly. The freight market is influenced by predictable factors such as economic activity and fleet growth, which develop gradually over time. However, “random shocks” is the most important variable in Stopford’s model. One such shock was the global financial crisis, when oil prices and <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> dropped significantly. While oil prices recovered quickly, <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> remained low for years. Another random shock was the American shale oil revolution, which led to substantial increases in oil production. Subsequently, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries sacrificed their objective to maintain stable and high oil prices and instead chose to protect their market share. Consequently, the oil prices dropped, while the <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> started to increase following the growing demand for cheap oil. This thesis demonstrates how unpredictable elements, such as oil price movements, have influenced the tanker market, and thus the fortunes of tanker owners. Fluctuations have always been {{an important part of the}} shipping market, and make the shipping sector an interesting object of study...|$|R

Cassatt wanted to end the rebate practice being undertaken by Standard Oil and Carnegie Steel, both larger shippers, which kept the freight rates extremely low: to do so, the two railroads bought stock in smaller and weaker trunk line railroads.

The plan worked: the average <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> for the two companies went up. Cassatt first purchased B stock in 1899, with a majority of stock being under PRR control in 1901.

2500|$|Justice Potter Stewart {{wrote the}} opinion in three parts.

[...] He determined that although [...] "attenuated," [...] SCRAP’s members had [...] "alleged a specific and perceptible harm that distinguished them from other citizens who had not used the natural resources that were claimed to be affected." [...] In Part III of the decision, Justice Stewart concluded that {{at this early stage}} of the rate increase review process (the suspension stage) the Court had no jurisdiction to issue a preliminary injunction. Although the 2.5 percent rate increase could go into effect (and the harm SCRAP alleged would occur), the ICC retained jurisdiction to further review the increase. The Court also noted the ICC’s intention to comply with NEPA’s requirements at a later stage in the proceedings.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} competitive transport markets in shaping the location of economic activity and the pattern of trade. In our model, carriers supply transport services for shipping man- ufactured goods, and <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> are set to clear transport markets.

These costs increase the <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> charged to firms located in regions that are net exporters of manufactured goods. Since demand for transport services depends on the spatial distribution of economic activity, the concentration of production in one region raises <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> to serve foreign markets from there, thus working against specialization and the agglomera- tion of firms.
