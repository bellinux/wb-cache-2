This peace treaty was ratified by Ranavalona and Rainilaiarivony in January 1886 and French government representatives two months later.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{manufacture}} of artificial plant ice was still negligible in 1880, it began to grow in volume {{towards the end of}} the century as technological improvements finally allowed the production of plant ice at a competitive price. Typically ice plants first took hold in more distant locations where natural ice was at a cost disadvantage. The Australian and Indian markets were already dominated by plant ice, and ice plants began to be built in Brazil during the 1880s and 1890s, slowly coming to replace imported ice. In the U.S., plants began to become more numerous in the southern states. The long distance transportation companies continued to use cheap natural ice for the bulk of their refrigeration needs, but they now used purchased local plant ice at <b>key</b> <b>points</b> across the US, to allow for surge demand and to avoid the need to hold reserve stocks of natural ice. After 1898 the British fishing industry too began to turn to plant ice to refrigerate its catches.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Pacific War, remnants of the United States Asiatic Fleet fled to Australia, on orders from Washington. The S-boats from the Philippines were organized into a fighting force at Brisbane, and Admiral Ernest King ordered S-boats from the Atlantic Fleet to supplement the force in Australia. Christie went along, arriving in April 1942, {{just in time for the}} Battle of the Coral Sea. During the Solomon Islands campaign, he ordered his boats to patrol around harbors which, while being <b>key</b> <b>points</b> for shipping, also tended to be heavily patrolled by aircraft and anti-submarine craft. In step with then-current U.S. Navy submarine doctrine, he made capital ships the prime targets, rather than have his boats focus on merchant shipping.|$|E
5|$|Bridges {{and other}} <b>key</b> <b>points</b> were {{prepared}} for demolition at short notice by preparing chambers filled with explosives. A Depth Charge Crater was a site in a road (usually at a junction) prepared with buried explosives that could be detonated to instantly form a deep crater as an anti-tank obstacle. The Canadian pipe mine (later known as the McNaughton Tube after General Andrew McNaughton) was a horizontally bored pipe packed with explosives– once in place this {{could be used to}} instantly ruin a road or runway. Prepared demolitions had the advantage of being undetectable from the air—the enemy could not take any precautions against them, or plot a route of attack around them.|$|E

5|$|During the French Revolutionary Wars, {{he fought}} with {{distinction}} {{again for the}} First Coalition, particularly at Ketsch and Frœschwiller, and in 1796 at Emmendingen, Schliengen and Kehl. He was stationed at <b>key</b> <b>points</b> to protect {{the movements of the}} Austrian army. With a force of 10,000, he defended the German Rhineland at Kehl, and reversed a bayonet assault by French troops at Bellheim; his troops also overran Speyer without any losses. By the end of the War of the First Coalition, at the age of 35, he had achieved the rank of Field Marshal. During the War of the Second Coalition, he fought in the first two battles of the German campaign, at Ostrach on 21 March 1799, and at Stockach on 25 March 1799. At the latter action while leading a regiment of grenadiers, he was hit by French case shot and knocked off his horse. He died shortly afterward.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{the player}} {{character}} discovers a secret underground laboratory containing Umbrella's experiments. In the lab, the player finds Jill or Chris {{in a cell}} and encounters Wesker programming a Tyrant, a giant humanoid supersoldier. Wesker reveals {{that he is a}} double agent working for Umbrella, and plans to use the Tyrant to kill the remaining STARS members. However, in the ensuing confrontation, Wesker is supposedly killed and the player character defeats the Tyrant. After activating the lab's self-destruct system, the player character reaches the heliport and manages to contact Brad for extraction. The game features multiple endings depending on the player's actions at <b>key</b> <b>points</b> {{over the course of the}} game. In the best ending, the surviving team members escape by helicopter after defeating the Tyrant one last time. In contrast, in the worst possible ending, the mansion remains intact and the player character is the sole survivor.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{plays with}} a single-handed backhand, which gives him great variety. He employs the slice, {{occasionally}} {{using it to}} lure his opponent to the net and deliver a passing shot. Federer can also fire topspin winners and possesses a 'flick' backhand with which he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net. His serve is difficult to read because he always uses a similar ball toss, regardless of what type of serve {{he is going to}} hit and where he aims to hit it, and turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on <b>key</b> <b>points</b> during a match. His first serve is typically around 200km/h (125mph); however, he is capable of serving at 220km/h (137mph). Federer is also accomplished at serve and volleying, and employed this tactic frequently in his early career.|$|E

5|$|In 1517, Martin Luther, an Augustinian friar in Germany, {{sent his}} Ninety-Five Theses to several bishops. His theses protested <b>key</b> <b>points</b> of Catholic {{doctrine}} {{as well as}} the sale of indulgences. In Switzerland, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin and other Protestant Reformers further criticised Catholic teachings. These challenges developed into the European movement called the Protestant Reformation, which gave birth to a variety of Christian denominations known today collectively as Protestantism. The English Reformation during the reign of Henry VIII began as a political dispute. When the pope denied Henry's petition for a declaration of nullity of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, he had the Acts of Supremacy passed, making him head of Church of England, forming Protestant Anglicanism.|$|E
5|$|In October 1886 Britain {{declared}} the Line {{to be the}} provisional frontier of British Guiana, and in February 1887 Venezuela severed diplomatic relations. Proposals for a renewal of relations and settlement of the dispute failed repeatedly, and by summer 1894, diplomatic relations had been severed for seven years, the dispute having dragged on for half a century. In addition, both sides had established police or military stations at <b>key</b> <b>points</b> in the area, partly to defend claims to the Caratal goldfield of the region's Yuruari basin, which was within Venezuelan territory but claimed by the British. The mine at El Callao, started in 1871, was for a time {{one of the richest}} in the world, and the goldfields as a whole saw over a million ounces exported between 1860 and 1883. The gold mining was dominated by immigrants from the British Isles and the British West Indies, giving an appearance of almost creating an English colony on Venezuelan territory.|$|E
5|$|In late May, the 6th Machine Gun Battalion was {{deployed}} {{to support the}} defensive operations in the Chateau–Thierry Sector. During this time they were employed as a complete unit {{in order to provide}} concentrated fire support at <b>key</b> <b>points</b> along the Allied line. The 77th and 81st Companies were assigned to the right flank while the 15th and 23rd Companies were assigned to the left. Their job was to lay down covering and harassing fire during both defensive and offensive operations. They also assisted the 5th and 6th Marine Regiments in their respective drives through Belleau Wood. On 10 June, the battalion's commanding officer, Major Cole, was mortally wounded and command temporarily passed to Captain Harlan E. Major. Captain George H. Osterhout took over on 11 June; however, he remained in command only until 21 June, when Major Littleton Waller officially took over.|$|E

5|$|In {{the month}} after the election, members of the Paris 2012 {{delegation}} argued that the London delegation had violated IOC rules. The <b>key</b> <b>points</b> in the accusations were London 2012's abortive athlete incentive initiative and lobbying by then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair. A public statement by IOC President Jacques Rogge dismissed these accusations, stating that the competition had been fair. Another controversy occurred during the bidding process when an undercover investigation by British television series Panorama revealed a corruption scandal associated with IOC member Ivan Slavkov and Olympic agents, who offered to deliver votes from IOC members to any 2012 Olympic bid in return for financial favours. Still recovering {{from the effects of}} the Salt Lake City scandal, the IOC reacted swiftly and punitively toward the rule-breaking individuals.|$|E
5|$|One of the <b>key</b> <b>points</b> {{stressed}} in {{this interpretation}} is that salvation {{is an individual}} experience difficult to communicate to outsiders. In his depiction of Camelot, the poet reveals a concern for his society, whose inevitable fall will bring about the ultimate destruction intended by God. Gawain was written {{around the time of}} the Black Death and Peasants' Revolt, events which convinced many people that their world was coming to an apocalyptic end and this belief was reflected in literature and culture. However, other critics see weaknesses in this view, since the Green Knight is ultimately under the control of Morgan le Fay, often viewed as a figure of evil in Camelot tales. This makes the knight's presence as a representative of God problematic.|$|E
