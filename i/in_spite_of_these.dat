5|$|By 1943, the Allies {{had gained}} air superiority over Germany, and bombings of German cities and {{industry}} had become commonplace. However, the Allies in their strategic bombing campaign did not concentrate on industry, and Speer {{was able to}} overcome bombing losses. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> losses, German production of tanks {{more than doubled in}} 1943, production of planes increased by 80 percent, and production time for Kriegsmarine submarines was reduced from one year to two months.

5|$|By most {{accounts}} Allen's first marriage was an unhappy one. His wife was rigidly religious, prone to criticizing him, and {{barely able to}} read and write. In contrast, Allen's behavior was sometimes quite flamboyant; and he maintained an interest in learning. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> differences the marriage survived until Mary's death in 1783. Allen and Mary had five children together (Loraine, Joseph, Lucy, Mary, and Pamela), only two of whom reached adulthood.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> {{failures}} and challenges, Diocletian's reforms fundamentally changed {{the structure of}} Roman imperial government and helped stabilize the empire economically and militarily, enabling the empire to remain essentially intact for another 150 years despite being near the brink of collapse in Diocletian's youth. Weakened by illness, Diocletian left the imperial office on 1 May 305, {{and became the first}} Roman emperor to abdicate the position voluntarily. He lived out his retirement in his palace on the Dalmatian coast, tending to his vegetable gardens. His palace eventually became the core of the modern-day city of Split in Croatia.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> {{steps toward}} equal treatment, a legal flaw remained: if {{children}} were born within a lesbian marriage, the non-biological mother was not legally regarded as a parent; she still had to undergo the lengthy financial process of adoption. This right was granted to heterosexual couples (married or not), where a stepfather could declare his wife's children to be his without further process. On 7 November 2006, the Spanish Parliament amended the law on assisted reproduction, allowing the non-biological mother {{to be regarded as}} a parent alongside her female spouse who is the birth-mother.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> {{valuable}} {{contributions to}} the Spartan cause, Alcibiades fell out of favor with the Spartan government at around this time, ruled by Agis II.

Alcibiades's influence was further reduced after the retirement of Endius, the ephor who was on good terms with him. It is alleged that Astiochus, a Spartan Admiral, was sent orders to kill him, but Alcibiades received warning of this order and defected to the Persian satrap Tissaphernes, who had been supporting the Peloponnesian forces financially in 412 BC.|$|E

U.S. forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing {{since the end of}} World War II, five years earlier, and Shadrick's division was the closest to the warzone. Under the command of Major General William F. Dean, the division was understrength and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> deficiencies the division was ordered into South Korea, tasked with taking the initial shock of the North Korean advances until the rest of the Eighth United States Army could arrive and establish a defense.|$|E
5|$|More than 1,400 gastroliths (stomach stones, 8 to 87mm in size) {{were found}} among the ribs and gastralia of {{specimen}} MPC-D100/127. The ratio of gastrolith mass to total weight, 0.0022, supports the theory that these gastroliths helped the toothless animals in grinding their food. Features such {{as the presence of}} a beak and a U-shaped, downturned jaw, are indicators of facultative (optional) herbivory among coelurosaurian theropods. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> features, fish vertebrae and scales were also {{found among the}} gastroliths, which suggests that it was an omnivore.

5|$|Shortly after {{attaining}} {{peak intensity}} on September20, Georges began to weaken, as upper-level vertical wind shear caused {{the eye to}} become cloud-filled and was no longer visible on satellite imagery. Convection associated with the storm also became less symmetric in nature. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> factors, Georges remained a major hurricane through September21. Continued weakening took place as the shear restricted {{a portion of the}} hurricane's outflow. At 0430UTC on September21, Georges made its initial landfall on Antigua with winds of 115mph (185km/h). Several hours later, the storm passed directly over St. Kitts. Shortly after passing over the island, the storm weakened to Category 2 status and winds decreased to 110mph (175km/h).|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Security Council {{voted to}} send {{assistance}} to the collapsing country. US President Harry S. Truman subsequently ordered ground troops into the nation.

At the time, the closest forces were the 24th Infantry Division of the Eighth United States Army, which was headquartered in Japan under the command of Major General William F. Dean.

5|$|During the 7th century AD, Motul de San José is {{recorded}} in hieroglyphic inscriptions {{as being a}} vassal of Calakmul. By the early 8th century the city had switched its allegiance to Jasaw Chan K'awiil I, king of Tikal, then falling under the power of Petexbatún, itself a vassal of Calakmul, {{in the middle of}} the 8th century, before once again switching its allegiance to Tikal. In 711, Jasaw Chan K'awiil I, Lord of Tikal, was recorded as overlord of Motul, perhaps reflecting Tikal's traditional overlordship of the city. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> shifting alliances, Motul de San José acted with a degree of independence and was a powerful kingdom in the 8th century AD, with its ruler using the kaloomte title given to high kings. The city's rulers became very successful on the political scene in the wider Maya region, with the use of politically motivated feasting, war, economics and political marriages.|$|E

5|$|Following the French Republic's {{declaration}} of war on Great Britain in February 1793, the French Navy immediately launched squadrons, individual cruisers and privateers against British trade routes in the Eastern Atlantic. The French Atlantic fleet, based at the fortified port of Brest in Brittany, {{was in a state}} of political turmoil during the early years of the war, suffering a mutiny in August 1793, and then defeat at the battle of Glorious First of June in 1794. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> difficulties, the independent raiders caused considerable damage to British commerce, and in response the Admiralty ordered a squadron of frigates from the Channel Fleet to cruise the French coastline in search of these raiders. This force, known as the flying squadron and initially commanded by Sir John Borlase Warren, achieved a number of successes in the first year of the war, most notably in the Action of 23 April 1794, when a French frigate squadron was destroyed.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of Anderson's childhood, the Queales lived at 56 Villa Street, in a house abutting Yeronga Memorial Park. On {{the opposite side of}} the park was Yeronga State School, the school at which Anderson began her formal education. In spite of its reputation as one of the best state schools in Queensland at the time, Yeronga State School rapidly became a site of dread and frustration for Anderson, who suffered from a speech impediment that caused strife for her in the classroom. Anderson's speech impediment (as well as her occasional flirtations with truancy) became such a hindrance to her education that her parents decided that she was to be home-schooled by her mother for a year, while attending weekly speech therapy sessions in the city. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> efforts, Anderson's slight stammer was to stay with her for the rest of her life; several observers commented that the impediment lent her speech a careful and deliberate air. Following her primary school education, Anderson attended high school at Brisbane State High School. Upon graduation, she attended Brisbane Technical College Art School.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Antoinism {{was very quiet}} after 1940. In Belgium, Joseph Nihoul, the President of the Antoinist Council, then his successors, led the {{religion}} until their death, alongside {{the members of this}} body. The authority of Catherine was challenged just after her death by the Belgian branch of the movement, which has withdrawn the religious changes she made: removal of photographs in the temples, deletion of baptism, marriage and communion, opposition to the translation of Antoine's works... However, a Belgian group who, claiming to be faithful to the true Antoinist tradition, opened a temple in Angleur on 1 April 1943, preferred to keep the portraits of the Antoines in the temple. In France, the Antoinists wanted to be faithful to all requirements provided by the founding couple. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> differences, the two branches show each other support and tolerance. Thus, after the death of Catherine, there were two forms of Antoinism, which still remain different today: one in Belgium, and one in France.|$|E
