500|$|Born in Amsterdam, Bergkamp was {{the last}} of Wim and Tonnie Bergkamp's four sons. He was brought up in a working-class suburb, in a family {{aspiring}} to reach middle-class status. His father, an electrician and amateur footballer in the lower leagues, named him in honour of Scottish striker Denis Law. To comply with Dutch given name customs, an extra [...] "n" [...] was inserted in Bergkamp's first name by his father after it was not accepted by the registrar. Bergkamp was raised as a Roman Catholic by his family and regularly attended church during his childhood. Although in later years he said visits to church did not appeal to him, Bergkamp still maintains his faith. According to Bergkamp, his childhood footballing hero was Glenn Hoddle, whom he admired for <b>his</b> <b>soft</b> precise touch.|$|E
500|$|The central {{character}} {{of the novel is}} James Bond, the fictional MI6 agent created by Ian Fleming. Faulks modelled his version of the character on Fleming's version, ignoring the other continuation authors and the films; when interviewed, Faulks said that [...] "My Bond is Fleming's Bond—not Connery, or Moore or Craig, for all their charms", going on to say that [...] "my Bond drinks and smokes as much as ever". Faulks saw Bond as a man in constant peril: [...] "This Bond, this solitary hero with <b>his</b> <b>soft</b> shoes and single under-powered weapon, was a man in dreadful danger. You feared for him." [...] On another occasion he returned to the theme, describing the character as [...] "a very vulnerable man, with his nice suit and soft shoes and ludicrously underpowered gun. He finds himself in terrible situations, and he's all on his own—you just worry for his safety." ...|$|E

500|$|Many of the Cuban {{musicians who}} {{featured}} on the album were at their musical prime in the 1940s and 1950s. After {{the success of the}} 1997 record they became known in Cuba as [...] "Los Superabuelos" [...] (the Super-Grandfathers). Juan de Marcos González, a Cuban folk revivalist who was younger than the bulk of performers introduced Cooder to veteran singer Ibrahim Ferrer. Ferrer (1927–2005) had been lead vocalist for bandleader Pacho Alonso, and also sang for Beny Moré, Cuba's most prominent performer in the 1940s, before <b>his</b> <b>soft</b> singing style fell out of fashion. Having found the semi-retired seventy-year-old Ferrer taking his daily stroll on the streets of Havana and shining shoes for extra money, González signed him up for the project. Cooder later described the discovery as something that happens [...] "perhaps once in your life", and Ferrer as [...] "the Cuban Nat King Cole". Ferrer became a prominent member of the group, and the success of the record was attributed in part to the popularity of his vocal performances. The singer went on to record a number of successful solo albums and performed with contemporary acts such as the Gorillaz before his death in 2005 at the age of 78.|$|E

After taking time off in 2000 due to ill-health, Reid {{announced that he was}} quitting the soap in May 2000. After Reid publicly declared that he would love Frank to have a last fling with Pat before he left, EastEnders bosses granted his wish and an affair was scripted. The pair enjoyed a liaison on a Spanish beach during a week-long August special set on the Costa Blanca, which saw Frank and Peggy go away with Pat and Roy and Terry and Irene Raymond (Gavin Richards and Roberta Taylor). A BBC spokesperson said: [...] "Pat is obviously incredibly torn between her love for her husband, Roy, and her old feelings for Frank. She's been hurt by Frank in the past, but she's coming to realise that she still has strong feelings for him and he has made no secret of <b>his</b> <b>soft</b> spot for her. I can confirm they do enjoy a romantic kiss on the beach." [...] On-screen, Pat and Frank's affair continued until they decided, in November 2000, to elope. In the specially extended episode marking Frank's official exit — which aired on 2 November 2000, but was Guy Fawkes Night in the on-screen events – Peggy discovered the affair amidst Frank's attempt to retrieve a letter of confession, following Pat's change of heart.|$|E
500|$|Hülkenberg, who {{qualified}} eleventh, was {{the fastest}} driver not to advance {{into the final}} session. His best time of 1:37.620 was 1.5 seconds slower than Webber's pace in the second session. He said eleventh place was a [...] "good position to start from" [...] despite losing the rear of his car in turn twelve, which caused him to abort one of his quick laps. Hülkenberg was followed in the times by the BMW Sauber drivers Kobayashi in twelfth and Heidfeld in thirteenth, followed by Sutil in the quickest of the two Force India cars. Petrov, who qualified in fifteenth, was penalised five positions on the grid because he had caused an avoidable accident with Hülkenberg {{at the start of}} the previous race at Suzuka. Petrov was aiming for a top ten grid position to minimise the effects of his grid penalty but he spun on his final timed lap after hitting a kerb; he was unable to set a quicker lap time because his tyres had become dirty. As a result, Jaime Alguersuari inherited 15th position, ahead of his teammate Sébastien Buemi who opted to run one flying lap with a light fuel load for his last run of the second session but made minor mistakes which cost him time. Vitantonio Liuzzi, Trulli and Timo Glock were the quickest drivers unable to advance beyond the first part of qualifying. Liuzzi complained the tyre wear on <b>his</b> <b>soft</b> compound tyres was so excessive it had caused him to struggle with a large amount of oversteer through the last two sectors of the track. The tenth row of the grid was filled by Heikki Kovalainen (Lotus) and Lucas di Grassi (Virgin). The two Hispania drivers completed the final two positions on the grid; Yamamoto in twenty-third was 0.8 seconds faster than his teammate Senna in twenty-fourth.|$|E

500|$|A {{distinctive}} deliberate mispronunciation of [...] "come on", used frequently by Jackson, occasionally spelled [...] "c'mon", [...] "cha'mone", or [...] "shamone", is also {{a staple}} in impressions and caricatures of him. The turn of the 1990s saw {{the release of the}} introspective album Dangerous. The New York Times noted that on some tracks, [...] "he gulps for breath, his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper, hissing through clenched teeth" [...] and he had a [...] "wretched tone". When singing of brotherhood or self-esteem the musician would return to [...] "smooth" [...] vocals. Of Invincible, Rolling Stone was of the opinion that, at age 43, Jackson still performed [...] "exquisitely voiced rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies". Nelson George wrote: [...] "The grace, the aggression, the growling, the natural boyishness, the falsetto, the smoothness—that combination of elements mark him as a major vocalist". Cultural critic Joseph Vogel notes that Jackson had a [...] "distinctive styles is his ability to convey emotion without the use of language: there are his trademark gulps, grunts, gasps, cries, exclamations; he also frequently scats or twists and contorts words until they are barely discernible." [...] Neil McCormick notes that Jackson's unorthodox singing style [...] "was original and utterly distinctive, from his almost ethereal falsetto to <b>his</b> <b>soft,</b> sweet mid-tones; his fluid, seamless control of often very fast moving series of notes; his percussive yet still melodic outbursts, ululations and interjections (from those spooky [...] "tee-hee-hees" [...] to grunts and wails). Unusually for someone coming from a black American soul tradition, he did not often sing straight, unadorned ballads, though when he did (from 'Ben' to 'She's Out of My Life') the effect was of a powerful simplicity and truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the late}} 1980s as the Soviet Union descended into crisis, Shevardnadze became {{increasingly}} unpopular {{and was in}} conflict with Soviet hard-liners who disliked his reforms and <b>his</b> <b>soft</b> line with the West. He criticised a campaign by Soviet troops to put down an uprising in his native Georgia in 1989. In protest over the growing influence of hardliners under Gorbachev, Shevardnadze suddenly resigned in December 1990, saying, [...] "Dictatorship is coming". A few months later, his fears were partially realised when an unsuccessful coup by Communist hardliners precipitated {{the collapse of the}} Soviet Union. Shevardnadze returned briefly as Soviet Foreign Minister in November 1991 but resigned with Gorbachev the following month, when the Soviet Union was formally dissolved.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of his most famous works, he {{attracted}} many uncritical hangers-on, but many others who sought him found him aloof and even dull. With <b>his</b> <b>soft</b> voice, he was sometimes shouted down or excluded from discussions. At this time, he was severely ill; it was wartime or the austerity period after it; during the war his wife suffered from depression; and after her death he was lonely and unhappy. In addition to that, he always lived frugally and seemed unable to care for himself properly. As a result of all this, people found his circumstances bleak. Some, like Michael Ayrton, called him [...] "Gloomy George," [...] but others developed the idea that he was a [...] "secular saint." ...|$|E

To replace Albert, NBC tapped studio host Bob Costas for play-by-play. Matt Guokas did not return to his post as main color commentator, and was replaced by NBA legend Isiah Thomas; Costas was replaced on the pre-game show by Hannah Storm. Midway through the season, Costas and Thomas were joined by recently fired Detroit Pistons coach Doug Collins. Collins served to take some weight off Thomas, who was considered by some to be uncomfortable in the role of lead analyst. Thomas, in particular, was singled out for <b>his</b> <b>soft</b> voice and often stammered analysis.|$|E
2500|$|The Sonny Rollins-penned [...] "Oleo" [...] {{followed}} {{along at}} a wild Paul Chambers bass tempo, as Evans' fluid orchestral piano technique suggested multiple key centers and modal impressions.

Evans displayed <b>his</b> <b>soft</b> and sensitive piano style. His unique and challenging sound {{was one of the}} reasons Miles Davis had hired him following Philly Joe's departure. The late-night languor of [...] "My Funny Valentine", along with Bill Evans' presence and the more consistent and improving sextet, would hint at the music later featured on Davis' next album, the 1959 jazz masterpiece Kind of Blue.|$|E
2500|$|The Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays is an {{examination}} of what cosmic rays are and how they work. It was written by Capra with Jonathan Latimer, a crime fiction novelist and screenwriter. As Gilbert describes it, {{the third and fourth}} films [...] "repeated the formulas of his earlier work while ever searching for new contrivances for popularization as well as the best language to express <b>his</b> <b>soft</b> religious message" [...] and that the script was essentially a reworking of ideas Capra had developed for a possible documentary about Robert A. Millikan. The film's screenplay works from the premise that the nature of cosmic rays is a mystery comparable to the great detective stories. A committee of marionettes representing Fyodor Dostoevsky, Charles Dickens, and Edgar Allan Poe is called upon to decide the question. The film was broadcast on October 25, 1957, apparently with a smaller television audience share and with more unfavorable reviews than for the first two specials.|$|E

2500|$|Following Ford's defeat, Warner {{began to}} {{consider}} political office for himself. [...] He entered {{politics in the}} 1978 Virginia election for U.S. Senate. Despite the publicity of being Elizabeth Taylor's husband and the {{large amounts of money}} Warner used in his campaign for the nomination, he finished second at the state Republican Party (GOP) convention to the far more conservative politician Richard D. Obenshain. Much of this loss was due to his perceived liberal political stances, especially <b>his</b> <b>soft</b> approach to Soviet relations. In contrast Obenshain was a noted anti-Soviet, a hardline anti-communist, and an opponent of other liberal policies including the Great Society and much of the Civil Rights Movement. However, fate intervened when Obenshain died two months later in a plane crash. Consequently, Warner was chosen to replace him and narrowly won the general election over Democrat Andrew P. Miller, former Attorney General of Virginia. He was in the Senate until January 3, 2009. Despite his less conservative policy stances, Warner managed to be the second longest-serving senator in Virginia's history, behind only Harry F. Byrd, Sr., and by far the longest-serving Republican Senator from the state. On August 31, 2007, Warner announced that he would not seek re-election in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Bill Rodriguez, one of Bass' {{graduate}} students, {{wrote his}} doctoral thesis on information gathered from this facility. Each day, he notated {{the presence of}} various insects on human cadavers and other information like changes in the body, and the timing of each of these. Rodriguez noticed that blow-flies immediately swarmed carcass in study and began mass-producing eggs all over its orifices. However, other insects were also attracted to the freshly rotting body including yellow jackets and wasps. Once the blow-fly eggs turned into maggots, beetles too began assembling on the body not only to feed on the body itself but on its co-inhabitants, the maggots, as well. In addition, the four stages of decomposition were systemically characterized in a scientific, orderly manner beginning with [...] "1-81". During the fresh stage, maggots fed and multiplied on the corpse. The skin of the upper jaw and mandible stretch into {{what looks like a}} smile, and the hair and skin are still securely attached to the skull. After a couple days, the body enters the bloat stage, which is caused by the gases that the bacteria in the intestines give off as they feed on the dead tissues. Next, the body slowly decomposes in the decay stage until it finally reaches the dry stage in which the body has basically become a skeleton. About a month passed before [...] "1-81" [...] entered the dry stage. Microbes and insects had consumed most of <b>his</b> <b>soft</b> tissues, and the sun had dried out what was left on the bones.|$|E
2500|$|Depictions of {{the speed}} and extent of injury to which Wolverine can heal vary due to a broad degree of artistic license {{employed}} by various comic book writers. Originally, this was portrayed as accelerated healing of minor wounds, though Chris Claremont, head writer of the X-Men comics from the mid 1970s to the early 1990s increased Wolverine's healing factor substantially, though not nearly as later writers would. During the 1980s, Wolverine's mutant healing factor is depicted as being able to heal massive levels of trauma, though his recovery time could extend to days, weeks or months before fully healing; often depending upon {{the severity of the}} injuries, their extent and the frequency with which they're inflicted. During the 1990s through the modern era, other writers have increased Wolverine's healing factor {{to the point that it}} could fully regenerate nearly any damaged or destroyed bodily tissues within seconds. Among the more extreme depictions of Wolverine's healing factor include fully healing after being caught near the center of an atomic explosion and the total regeneration of <b>his</b> <b>soft</b> body tissue, within a matter of minutes, after having it incinerated from his skeleton. An explanation is given in a recent mini-series starring Wolverine for the increase of his healing powers. In the series, Wolverine is referred to as an [...] "adaptive self-healer" [...] after undergoing numerous traumatic injuries to test the efficiency of his healing factor. Wolverine has endured so much trauma, and so frequently, that his healing factor has adapted, becoming faster and more efficient to cope with increasing levels of trauma. The Xavier Protocols, a series of profiles created by Xavier that lists the strengths and weaknesses of the X-Men, states that Wolverine's healing factor is increased to [...] "incredible levels" [...] and theorizes that the only way to stop him is to decapitate him and remove his head from the vicinity of his body.|$|E
