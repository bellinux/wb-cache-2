40|$|Initiated by {{studying}} the characteristics of our 1 st generation opto-electronic packet switch (VIVALDI), we identified the impacting factors {{for the performance of}} a generic system under a burst-like traffic environment. Analyzing the complex relationship between system resource (i. e. connectivity and throughput) and performance (i. e. packet delays), a novel architecture based on a revolutionary principle of group switching was designed that produced significant reduction in the hardware required and the difficulties in operations, and yet still achieved an acceptable level of performance. The centre of the architecture lays a novel solid state switching device with ultra fast response characteristics – in the order of microseconds. The deployment of this new device further reduces the required level of system complexity – making the architecture a truly practical solution. An experimental demonstrator was designed and built to verify the feasibility of the new device in the application of optical switching. This thesis is structured in five sections. The first <b>section</b> (<b>chapter</b> 1 & 2) states the motivations and goals of our research work and looks at the currently available methods of optical switching. The second <b>section</b> (<b>chapter</b> 3) discusses the analysis conducted on the 1 st generation VIVALDI architecture. The results and analytical methods used form a foundation for our more advanced architecture. The third <b>section</b> (<b>chapters</b> 4 - 7) presents the origination of the group switching principle and the architectural design of the novel system. Simulations are used to assess the performance of the system. In the fourth <b>section</b> (<b>chapter</b> 8), we discuss the results of our experimental work from the optical core demonstrator. Finally, in <b>section</b> five (<b>chapter</b> 9), we conclude our findings from the project and provide guidelines to future research works.

In the first <b>section</b> (<b>Chapter</b> 2) I use data from field mapping, isotopic geochronology, whole rock geochemistry and trace element concentrations in zircons to examine the petrology, geochemistry and ages of the Haquira East porphyry copper deposit of southern Peru. In the second <b>section</b> (<b>Chapters</b> 3 - 6) I investigate the timing, temperature, zonation and lifespan of the magmatic-hydrothermal alteration and Cu-Mo mineralization by applying field mapping, whole rock geochemistry, petrography, geothermometry, spectral, X-ray and cathodoluminiscense imaging of rock samples. The timescales of the magmatic-hydrothermal system was constrained by isotopic dating, diffusion of titanium in quartz and the novel approach of oxygen diffusion via δ¹⁸O of quartz analyzed by secondary ion mass spectrometry. These data are also used construct cross-sections and 3 D models. In the final <b>section</b> (<b>Chapter</b> 7) I describe the production and evaluation of a calibration for portable X-ray spectrometers that could potentially be applied to further investigate porphyry copper deposits. Haquira East is a moderate grade porphyry copper-molybdenum-gold deposit (688 Mt ore at 0. 59 wt. ...|$|R
