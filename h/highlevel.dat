In a two-sector exogenousgrowth framework we model a stochastic environmental good,exhibiting uncertain ecological responses to environmental change anddescribe the economic and environmental trade-offs that ensue for arisk-averse social planner. Allowing for ecological risk tends to slowlong run economic growth if environmental impacts are assumed toincrease exponentially as the level of disturbance increases.

Nutrients andcarbon are removed from farmland as food is harvested, processed and eaten andthe resulting waste is discharged into rivers and coastal waters downstreamfrom population centres and usually not returned to farmland. Rivers and oceans becomeincreasingly contaminated by sewage, toxic effluents and mineral run-offs.

40|$|Abstract—Leupaxin is a LIM domain–containing adapter protein {{belonging}} to the paxillin family that has been previously reported to be preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells. Herein, we identified leupaxin in a screen for focal adhesion kinase binding partners in aortic smooth muscle, and we show that leupaxin is enriched in human and mouse vascular smooth muscle and that leupaxin expression is dynamically regulated during development. In addition, our studies reveal that leupaxin can undergo cytoplasmic/nuclear shuttling and functions as an serum response factor cofactor in the nucleus. We found that leupaxin forms a complex with serum response factor and associates with CArG-containing regions of smooth muscle promoters and that ectopic expression of leupaxin induces smooth muscle marker gene expression in both 10 T 1 / 2 cells and rat aortic smooth muscle cells. Subsequent studies indicated that enhanced focal adhesion kinase activity (induced by fibronectin or expression of constitutively active focal adhesion kinase) attenuates the nuclear accumulation of leupaxin and limits the ability of leupaxin to enhance serum response factor–dependent gene transcription. Thus, these studies indicate that modulation of the subcellular localization of serum response factor cofactors is 1 mechanism by which extracellular matrix–dependent signals may regulate phenotypic switching of smooth muscle cells.
