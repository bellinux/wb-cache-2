The analysis takes into consideration attenuations due to atmospheric turbulence, <b>geometric</b> <b>spread</b> and pointing errors at the same time. We derive, in generalized infinite power series expressions, the tight upper and lower bounds of the overall outage probability and average probability of errors of the system. The study finds that this two-way subcarrier intensity- modulated AF relaying system using a binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation could be used for practical applications in case of a weak turbulence regime in which the required SNR is about 30 dB to obtain the average bit error probability of 10 - 6.

50|$|A {{sound wave}} propagates through a {{material}} as a localized pressure change. Increasing {{the pressure of}} a gas or fluid increases its local temperature. The local speed of sound in a compressible material increases with temperature; as a result, the wave travels faster during the high pressure phase of the oscillation than during the lower pressure phase. This affects the wave's frequency structure; for example, in an initially plane sinusoidal wave of a single frequency, the peaks of the wave travel faster than the troughs, and the pulse becomes cumulatively more like a sawtooth wave. In other words, the wave self-distorts. In doing so, other frequency components are introduced, which can be described by the Fourier series. This phenomenon is characteristic of a non-linear system, since a linear acoustic system responds only to the driving frequency. This always occurs but the effects of <b>geometric</b> <b>spreading</b> and of absorption usually overcome the self distortion, so linear behavior usually prevails and nonlinear acoustic propagation occurs only for very large amplitudes and only near the source.|$|E

Our KDS is compact; it has linear output-sensitive memory consumption. It is responsive; it repairs itself inO(log ∆) time per kinetic event.

The Pn phase provides important constraints on source type, location, and magnitude, but its propagation is complicated by frequency-dependent sensitivity to the Earth’s sphericity and lithospheric velocity structure. Converging on an acceptable Pn <b>geometric</b> <b>spreading</b> correction and specifying its uncertainties, a requirement for accurately determining frequency-dependent attenuation models for Pn, depends on improved understanding {{of the behavior of}} Pn <b>geometric</b> <b>spreading</b> for various heterogeneous models. We investigate the effects of radial mantle lid velocity gradi-ents, mantle lid random volumetric velocity heterogeneities, and Moho topography on Pn <b>geometric</b> <b>spreading</b> using reflectivity and two-dimensional (2 D) finite-difference 1 -Hz wave propagation calculations for elastic Earth models. Mantle lid velocity gra-dients systematically modify the frequency-dependent <b>geometric</b> <b>spreading</b> from that found for models with constant velocity but retain the same overall functional form.

Our current focus is on Pn, an extremely important phase in seismic event identification.

By embedding PG(2 ^m - 1, 2) into (2 ^m - 1, 4), a basis of the latter space is constructed that is invariant under m 2 as well.

In this way, {{it is possible to}} separate the attenuation operator from other non-attenuation effects, e. g. reflections. The Wiener filtering technique, or the damped least-squares, is used to calculate the attenuation operator. For the damped least squares, we have corrected for the effect due to the addition of the damping constant using a perturbation method. Numerical tests are carried out to illustrate the technique. The <b>geometric</b> beam <b>spreading</b> of ultrasonic waves generated by a source of finite size can strongly affect the result of attenuation measurements.

40|$|Stacking of seismic data is {{conventionally}} {{done in the}} time-offset domain. This has {{the disadvantage}} that <b>geometric</b> <b>spreading</b> must be removed before true-amplitude processing can be attempted. This inconvenience arises since wave motion in the time-offset domain is determined by spherical waves. Plane waves in layered media, on the other hand, {{are not subject to}} <b>geometric</b> <b>spreading.</b> Hence, processing of both isotropic and anisotropic data in such media benefits from first applying a planewave decomposition such as a proper tau-p transform. The resulting tau-p gathers can be flattened and stacked over slowness. Subsequent time differentiation is needed to counter the loss of high frequencies during stacking. This approach has the advantage that the <b>geometric</b> <b>spreading</b> is removed without prior knowledge of the actual (an) isotropic velocity field and without any need to pick traveltimes or moveout velocities. Subsequent moveout corrections naturally require knowledge of the velocity field. The proposed methodology is exact for 3 D data volumes and arbitrary anisotropy in laterally homogeneous media or for 2 D acquisition lines over 1 D, isotropic media or over 1 D, transversely isotropic media with vertical axis of symmetry (VTI). It relies on the same principles as more conventional <b>geometric</b> <b>spreading</b> corrections and time-offset stacking. In many respects, it is even more flexible.
