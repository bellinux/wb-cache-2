5|$|His curveball, like Madison Bumgarner, has two speeds with {{different}} types of movement, though he throws <b>his</b> <b>slow</b> curveball much more frequently than does Bumgarner, and will sometimes throw a curve that is more in the middle range combining the types of movement. His two-seamer is his most-used pitch against right-handed hitters and is used more frequently than against lefties, as is his slider. His changeup is only thrown to left-handed hitters. Greinke's curveball is typically used early in the count, while his slider is his most common 2-strike pitch.|$|E
5|$|Sainsbury {{was born}} on 5 July 1851 in Bath, Somerset, the {{youngest}} son of John Popham Sainsbury. He attended Sherborne School, an independent school in north-west Dorset. Playing for the school's cricket eleven he acquired a reputation for <b>his</b> <b>slow</b> underarm bowling, which could deceive even the most wary opponent into conceding his wicket. He was considered an even better batsman, and often opened the innings for the school.|$|E
5|$|Collins was a keen gambler, a pastime {{that became}} {{habitual}} {{during his time}} as {{a soldier in the}} Great War. After the war, he played with the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team (AIF XI) that toured England, South Africa and Australia and was later appointed captain of the team. He was not a stylish or forceful batsman, preferring to rely on nudges and deflections to score runs. <b>His</b> <b>slow</b> left arm off-spin, bowled from a two step run up, was seldom seen after the AIF XI tour. On return to Australia, he made his Test début against England at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) scoring 104 in the second innings; the fifth Australian to score a century on Test début. He was appointed captain of the Australian team in 1921 in South Africa, when the previous captain, Warwick Armstrong, fell ill.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the 2016 NFL Draft, Lawler {{had been}} {{projected}} by NFL scouts and analysts to be a middle-round pick. Lawler slid {{in part due}} to his leaner frame and <b>his</b> <b>slower</b> 40-yard dash time.|$|R
5|$|Despite <b>his</b> <b>slow</b> scoring in the Tests, Hassett was {{dynamic in}} the Shield matches for Victoria. In two matches for Victoria between the Third and Fourth Tests, Hassett hit 200 against Queensland and 190 against NSW; in both innings he scored {{at a rate}} of almost 50 runs per hour. Victoria won both their matches against arch-rivals NSW convincingly, by an innings and 288 runs respectively, and won the Sheffield Shield, having secured victory {{in each of the four}} matches that Hassett played in. Hassett was highly {{productive}} throughout the whole season, ending with 1,213 runs at 71.35.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{struggles in}} the Test arena, Brown had {{success in the}} tour matches as an opener. He scored 1,448 runs at 57.92 in all {{first-class}} matches, ranking fourth in both the aggregates and averages. He scored eight centuries, second only to Bradman, including 200 against Cambridge University. However, Brown gained criticism for <b>his</b> <b>slow</b> batting. Following his omission from the Test team, Brown batted in a highly circumspect manner to increase the reliability and volume of his scoring. A very occasional off spin bowler, Brown took his career first-class best of 4/16 in his only stint with the ball, against the South of England.|$|E
5|$|Jardine's batting {{performance}} in 1928 {{was similar to}} that from the previous season. He played 14 matches, scoring 1,133 runs at an average of 87.15. He was successful in high-profile matches, scoring 193 for Gentlemen at the Oval, where the crowd had booed <b>his</b> <b>slow</b> start (at one stage, he took half an hour to score two runs) but later cheered him as his last fifty runs were scored in half an hour. For the same team at Lord's, he scored 86 and 40. He captained The Rest against England in a Test trial and made the highest score in each innings, scoring 74 not out in the fourth innings to help his team to draw the game on a difficult pitch, against international bowlers Maurice Tate and Harold Larwood.|$|E

5|$|Most {{commonly}} {{employed as}} a right-handed opening batsman, Sainsbury was one of Somerset's most talented batsman during their formative years. <b>His</b> <b>slow</b> underarm bowling was effective in second-class cricket, but {{in an era when}} overarm bowling was becoming the standard, he was used sparingly in the first-class game. During his time at Somerset, the county gained first-class status. After being led for three seasons by Sainsbury's Lansdown team-mate Stephen Newton, Sainsbury was given the Somerset captaincy for the 1885 season. A combination of poor results {{and not being able to}} raise a full eleven during that season led to the county's removal from the first-class game, although Sainsbury remained as captain until 1888. By the time Somerset had improved sufficiently to return to first-class cricket in 1891, Sainsbury had moved to neighbouring county Gloucestershire, where he saw out his county cricket career.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{dominated}} his country's {{war effort}} during World War II {{to a greater}} extent than any other national leader. He assumed the role of supreme commander of the armed forces during 1938, and subsequently made all major decisions regarding Germany's military strategy. His decision to mount a risky series of offensives against Norway, France, and the Low Countries in 1940 against the advice of the military proved successful, though the diplomatic and military strategies he employed in attempts to force the United Kingdom out of the war ended in failure. Hitler deepened his involvement in the war effort by appointing himself commander-in-chief of the Army in December 1941; from this point forward he personally directed the war against the Soviet Union, while his military commanders facing the Western Allies retained a degree of autonomy. Hitler's leadership became increasingly disconnected from reality as the war turned against Germany, with the military's defensive strategies often hindered by <b>his</b> <b>slow</b> decision making and frequent directives to hold untenable positions. Nevertheless, he continued to believe that only his leadership could deliver victory. In the final months of the war Hitler refused to consider peace negotiations, regarding the complete destruction of Germany as preferable to surrender. The military did not challenge Hitler's dominance of the war effort, and senior officers generally supported and enacted his decisions.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Moreno speculated {{later that}} he was {{poisoned}} by the captain. Manuel Moreno was unsure of whether the captain really given him that substance, or if he substituted something else, or gave an even higher dose. Circumstances did not allow an autopsy to be performed. Further points used to sustain {{the idea of a}} murder are the captain's refusal to land elsewhere, <b>his</b> <b>slow</b> sailing, his administration of the emetic in secrecy, and that he didn't return to Buenos Aires with the ship. Enrique de Gandía pointed to an irregular ruling of the Junta that appointed a British person named Curtis as Moreno's replacement for the diplomatic mission in the case of Moreno's death. The son of Mariano Moreno commented to the historian Adolfo Saldías that his mother, Guadalupe Cuenca, received an anonymous gift of a mourning hand fan and handkerchief, with instructions to use them soon. By that time, the murder of Moreno was a common assumption, and it was mentioned during the trial of residence {{of the members of the}} Junta. Juan Madera stated at the trial that Moreno may have requested to go to Britain because he was afraid of being murdered, and that he may have stated this during the meeting when the Junta discussed his resignation. Modern author Manuel Luis Martín studied the health of both Moreno and his family, and concluded that he died of natural causes.|$|E

25|$|His {{first-class}} debut came in 1996 for Middlesex {{before he}} moved to Sussex in 1999. He made 2 centuries in his career, an innings of 110 against Glamorgan and 106 at Chester-le-Street. <b>His</b> <b>slow</b> left arm bowling gave him 49 first class wickets and a best of 5 for 103 against Northampton.|$|E
25|$|Misbah was the ODI captain from 2008–2015 {{and had the}} 10th highest success rate. He left in 2015 as captain from {{criticism}} due to <b>his</b> <b>slow</b> yet successful approach.

50|$|The {{big guns}} — David Gower, Allan Lamb, and Mike Gatting — were to follow, but Ian Botham was {{probably}} the most destructive of them all. Kapil Dev used <b>his</b> <b>slowest</b> bowlers, Mohinder Amarnath and Kirti Azad, to strangle them. They bowled slow and straight, not trying to experiment too much, and sticking to the tasks allotted to them.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, Buell {{was forced}} to abandon <b>his</b> <b>slow</b> advance toward Chattanooga. Receiving word of the Confederate movements, he decided to {{concentrate}} his army around Nashville. The news that Smith and Bragg were both in Kentucky convinced him {{of the need to}} place his army between the Confederates and the Union cities of Louisville and Cincinnati. On September 7, Buell's Army of the Ohio left Nashville and began racing Bragg to Louisville.|$|E

Poulidor's face was deeply tanned and furrowed; Anquetil had high cheekbones, a smoother face and brushed-up blond hair.|$|E
25|$|He played {{twice for}} Wellington in 1924-25 without success, then {{returned}} to Wellington club cricket, where in a long career he scored more than 10,000 runs. However, he played one final match for Wellington in 1929-30 against Otago. Having never taken a wicket before in first-class cricket, he took 3 for 50 and 5 for 50 with <b>his</b> <b>slow</b> bowling to help Wellington to a 64-run victory {{on their way to}} another Plunket Shield.|$|E
50|$|Rock Sand was a notably bad mover in <b>his</b> <b>slower</b> paces: those {{unfamiliar}} with his gait frequently {{assumed that he}} was lame when he trotted or cantered to the start before his races.

Johnson captained the under-19 side at the 2006 under-19 World Cup; amongst his performances was an innings of 83 against South Africa to help his team secure a place in the next round of the competition.|$|E
25|$|Lawry {{made his}} Test debut on Australian {{soil in the}} First Test of the 1962–63 Ashes series at Brisbane. After making half-centuries in {{consecutive}} lead-in matches, he narrowly missed making a century in the drawn series opener, being dismissed for 98 in the second innings. Between Tests, Lawry scored 177 and 26 in a losing effort against the MCC for Victoria, and then made 133 in the next match against New South Wales, helping Victoria to an eight-wicket win, although he was jeered by an impatient gallery fed up with <b>his</b> <b>slow</b> batting.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the tour}} of England, Jayasekera did not play at senior level for Sri Lanka again until 1981–1982, when a second-innings 52 for a Board XI against England saw him receive a call-up as wicket-keeper to the {{national}} side for Sri Lanka's first international, against England. Batting at three, Jayasekara ground out 17 runs from 42 deliveries, as his team chased 212 to win in 45 overs (or 270 deliveries). <b>His</b> <b>slow</b> scoring left it to the lower order to accumulate runs, and they nearly managed, but Sri Lanka still lost by five runs.|$|E

2500|$|As a bowler, Grace {{belonged to}} what Altham calls the [...] "high, home and easy school {{of a much}} earlier day". Using a roundarm action, Grace was adept at varying both his pace and the arc of <b>his</b> <b>slower</b> {{deliveries}} which worked in from the leg side of the pitch. The chief feature of his bowling was the excellent length which he consistently maintained. He originally bowled at a consistently fast medium pace but in the 1870s he increasingly adopted <b>his</b> <b>slower</b> style which utilised a leg break. He called his leg break a [...] "leg-tweeker" [...] but he put very little break on the ball, just enough to bring it across from the batsman's legs to the wicket and he invariably posted a fielder in a strategic position on the square leg boundary, a trap which brought occasional success. He was unusual in persisting with his roundarm action throughout his career, when almost all other bowlers adopted the new overarm style.|$|R
