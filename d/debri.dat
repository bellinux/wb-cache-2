40|$|Microglia are {{considered}} to be specialized cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage and constitute the major resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Several reports indicate that microglia may be derived from two sources, the first being myeloid precursors that colonize the CNS, referred to as resident microglia [1 - 3]. In contrast, exogenous microglia precursors are derived from bone marrow cells (BMC) [4 - 11] or from circulating monocytes in the periphery [12, 13]. Resident microglia have been shown to play dual roles in the progression of neurodegenerative disor-ders. These cells can release pro-inflammatory molecules that are neurotoxic and induce neurodegeneration [14, 15].

40|$|Abstract High-resolution seismic {{profiling}} (12 kHz) surveys {{combined with}} sediment cores, radiocarbon dating, tephrochronology and multibeam bathymetry (when available) allow documentation {{of a range}} of Holocene mass wasting events in nearby contrasting lakes of volcanic origin in the French Massif Central (45 °N, 2 °E) : two deep maar lakes (Pavin and Chauvet) and a shallow lake (Montcineyre) dammed by the growth of a volcano. In these lacustrine environments dominated by authigenic sedimentation, recent slide scars, acoustically transparent to chaotic lens-shaped bodies, slump deposits or reworked regional tephra layers suggest that subaqueous mass wasting processes may have been favoured by gas content in the sediments and lake level changes. While these events may have had a limited impact in both lakes Chauvet and Montcineyre, they apparently favoured the development of lacustrine meromicticity in maar Lake Pavin along with possible subaerial <b>debri...</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction In Conway's Game of Life [1], if one {{starts with}} a large 1 array of {{randomly}} 2 set cells, then after around twenty thousand generations one will see that all motion has died down, and only stationary objects of low period remain, providing a final density of about. 0287. No methods are known for proving rigorously that this behavior should occur, but it is reliably observed in simulations. After 500 steps, active areas are still common. Eventually all activity subsides, leaving only debris. This brings up several interesting related questions. Why does this "freezing" occur? After everything has frozen, what is the remaining debris composed of? Is there some construction that can "eat through" the debris? If we start with an infinitely large random grid, so that all constructions appear somewhere, what will the long term behavior be?

40|$|Rainfall weakens an earth {{slope and}} {{triggers}} mass movement. Relevant triggering mechanisms {{are complex and}} include reduction of capillary pressure due to increased saturation and frictional drag on the sediment induced by fluid flow. Physics-based continuum models utilizing modern computational tools are useful for understanding the mechanisms of deformation in partially saturated slopes; however, they do not provide a scalar indicator called ‘factor of safety ’ that measures the potential of a given slope for mass movement. In the present work, we employ sequential calculations consisting of a physics-based finite element model that couples solid deformation with fluid flow to quantify the stress and deformation fields in a steep hillside slope subjected to rainfall infiltration.

Methods: Instruments were immersed in saline solution after use, and glucoprotamin {{was added to}} a concentration of 1. 5 % before soaking for 60 minutes. Biocidal activity {{was determined by the}} difference in colony-forming units (CFU) on instruments before and after disinfection. Results: One hundred thirty-seven instruments were collected during 10 days and exposed to a 1. 5 % dilution of glucoprotamin without prior washing.

We use one tracking and three non-tracking codes to identify substructure (bound and unbound) in a Milky Way type simulation from the Aquarius suite (Springel et al. 2008) and post-process their output with a common pipeline to determine the properties of these substructures in a uniform way. By using output from a fully cosmological simulation, we also take a step beyond previous studies of tidal de-bris that have used simple toy models. We find that both tracking and non-tracking codes agree well on the identification of subhaloes and more importantly, the unbound tidal features as-sociated with them. The distributions of basic properties of the total substructure distribution (mass, velocity dispersion, position) are recovered with a scatter of ∼ 20 %.

40|$|Reliable {{assessment}} {{of the impact of}} Siberian boreal forest wildfires on the environment and climate necessitates an improved understanding of microphysical and chemical properties of emitted aerosols. Smoldering, flaming and mixed fires of typical Siberian biomass (pine and debris) were simulated during a small-scale study in a Large Aerosol Chamber (LAC). Individual particle analysis of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 smoke morphology and elemental composition revealed a strong dependence on combustion temperature, i. e., a dominant abundance of soot agglomerates versus roughly spherical organic particles in the flaming and smoldering phase, respectively. Cluster analysis of smoke microstructure was used to apportion the emitted particles into major characteristic groups: Soot and Organic, which accounted for around 90 % and 60 % of total particle numbers emitted from the flaming and smoldering fires, respectively. Carbon fractions and inorganic ion analysis supported the identification of particle types representative of combustion phase and biomass type. Elemental carbon (EC) particles from flaming fires comprised approximately 25 % of Group Soot, in good agreement with a high EC fraction in total carbon of around 65 % and low organic carbon (OC) /EC ratio near 0. 5.
