The {{goal of the}} Ethical Leadership {{component}} has been articulated by MSU as [...] "students will articulate their value systems, act ethically {{within the context of}} a democratic society, and demonstrate engaged and principled leadership." [...] The stated objective of the Cultural Competence component is [...] "students will recognize and respect multiple perspectives and cultures." [...] Two goals have been articulated for the Community Engagement portion of the mission. They are that [...] "students will recognize the importance of contributing their knowledge and experiences to their own community and the broader society" [...] and [...] "students will recognize the importance of scientific principles in the <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> public policy." [...] The public affairs mission is emphasized and enhanced by designated Public Affairs Professorships and a Provost Fellow for Public Affairs, special scholarship programs, grant program, Excellence in Community Service Awards, a yearly week-long Missouri Public Affairs Academy for high school students, a campus-wide public affairs emphasis week and the annual MSU Public Affairs Conference which brings together a diverse group of speakers and panelist for public discussions of various aspects of the public affairs mission. [...] Past conference speakers have included Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Nawal El Saadawi, Les Garland, John Edwards and Frances Hesselbein.|$|E

The interpolation scheme based on these reduced-order IPTFs is computationally more efficient and yields results perceptually comparable to those attainable by the bilinear method, which uses the HRTFs directly. Therefore, the proposed method is promising for real-time <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> spatial <b>sound...</b>|$|R

50|$|Later, Tolpygo {{generalized}} {{his theory}} to describe homopolar crystals (Si, Ge, diamond, etc.), cryocrystals of noble gases, and molecular crystals by introducing long-range Coulomb interactions in their lattice dynamics.

A number of new effects were predicted, e.g., generation of an electric field (electromagnetic wave) in a crystal by a nonuniform deformation (wave). This effect {{is now known as}} flexoelectric effect. In 1961, Tolpygo predicted <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> by moving current carriers, now a well known effect in acousto-electronics. Tolpygo applied his theory of deformable ions to study the small-radius localized states of electrons in solids. This theory accounted for the interaction of electrons with phonons of all branches and wavelengths, and was applied to the theory of polaritons, F-centers, and excitons in alkali halide crystals.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{audio signals}} are {{interpreted}} by the human ear-brain system, that complex perceptual mechanism should be simulated somehow in software for [...] "machine listening". In other words, to perform on par with humans, the computer should hear and understand audio content much as humans do. Analyzing audio accurately involves several fields: electrical engineering (spectrum analysis, filtering, and audio transforms); artificial intelligence (machine learning and sound classification); psychoacoustics (sound perception); cognitive sciences (neuroscience and artificial intelligence); acoustics (physics of sound production); and music (harmony, rhythm, and timbre). Furthermore, audio transformations such as pitch shifting, time stretching, and sound object filtering, should be perceptually and musically meaningful. For best results, these transformations require perceptual understanding of spectral models, high-level feature extraction, and sound analysis/synthesis. Finally, structuring and coding the content of an audio file (sound and metadata) could benefit from efficient compression schemes, which discard inaudible information in the sound. Computational models of music and sound perception and cognition {{can lead to a}} more meaningful representation, a more intuitive digital manipulation and <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> and music in musical human-machine interfaces.|$|E
