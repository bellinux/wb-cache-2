5|$|There {{have been}} various {{opinions}} regarding both the artificial surface and temporary grass surfaces used for soccer matches. After the Brazilian national team defeated Canada's side 3–2 in 2008, Brazil's coach commented {{that one reason}} for his team's unexpectedly poor performance was the loosely installed <b>grass</b> <b>field.</b> The Grenada national team struggled {{to cope with the}} artificial surface during their loss at the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. In July 2009, the U.S. Soccer Federation chose D.C. United's RFK Stadium over CenturyLink Field for the U.S. Open Cup. The general manager of D.C. United speculated that RFK's <b>grass</b> <b>field</b> {{was one of the reasons}} his team had a stronger bid. The general manager of the Sounders, Adrian Hanauer, told The Seattle Times in 2010 that replacement of the surface was a continuing conversation between the Sounders and Allen's Vulcan Inc. When the Los Angeles Galaxy traveled to Seattle in May 2012, the FieldTurf was noted as one of the reasons David Beckham and Robbie Keane were left out of the line-up.|$|E

5|$|Værnes {{is first}} {{recorded}} in the 10th century as the seat for one of eight chieftains in Trøndelag. The first military activity in the area was {{as a base for}} leidang. After the Viking Age, the farm at Værnes was taken over by the king and became the seat of the vogt. From 1671, the farm was owned by a series of military officers and public servants. In 1887, the farm was bought by the Royal Norwegian Army and converted to a camp. The first aircraft to use Værnes was a military Farman MF.7 Longhorn, which took off on 26 March 1914. It was part of the plan to establish the Norwegian Army Air Service, for which Værnes was chosen as the initial station for Central Norway. Radio equipment was installed in 1919 and the first hangar was built in 1920. By 1922, the <b>grass</b> <b>field</b> serving as runway has become insufficient for newer planes, both in terms of length and level, but an extension was not performed until 1925. In 1927, parliament passed legislation to move the division to Rinnleiret from 1930, but this was later annulled. With the delivery of Fokker aircraft in 1930, the runway was again upgraded and extended.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{a natural}} <b>grass</b> <b>field,</b> AstroTurf was {{installed}} in Memorial Stadium in 1981 and remained for 14 seasons. Natural grass returned for the 1995 season. During this return, the varsity football practices were held at Witter Rugby Field, saving the stadium's <b>grass</b> <b>field</b> for game days only. In 2003 artificial turf was re-installed with Momentum Turf, an infilled artificial turf, similar to FieldTurf. The Momentum Turf surface allowed for minimal maintenance and increased utilization of the stadium, for football practices and other sports, on the space-limited UC Berkeley campus. Memorial Stadium's field is also marked for international soccer, but this allows little reserve room beyond the official lines.|$|E
