50|$|Thaniel, {{defeated}} and heartbroken {{over the}} loss of Alaizabel and knowing that he failed to stop the <b>Green</b> <b>Tack</b> killings and as a result all of the Fraternity's plans have now come to fruition, retreats and is about to give up. The others prepare for the inevitable as the victim dies and the darkness arrives upon London.|$|E
50|$|By {{this point}} Carver realizes that Maycraft cannot be trusted and seeks out the beggar lord. He and Crott share {{information}} and thus Thaniel gains a new ally. Crott's Devil Boy Jack, a fortune teller {{of the highest}} order, whose eyes are sewn shut, predicts that the darkness is coming {{as soon as the}} last <b>green</b> <b>tack</b> murder takes place. The last victim's name is Leanna Butcher.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Green</b> <b>Tack</b> murders are {{a series}} of sacrifices that, when all placed on a map, form the shape of the Chackh'morg. While trying to save the final victim, Thaniel realises that the culprit it really a Wych-kin called Rawhead, summoned by the Fraternity to carry out the killings, and {{although}} Thaniel defeated the monster, it succeeded in mortally wounding the unfortunate victim. The Fraternity also manage to kidnap Alaizabel from under his nose at the same time.|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} pressure for products to be manufactured in part or entirely from renewable materials {{and for the}} energy consumption over {{the life cycle of}} products to be minimised. In the case of products based on rubber, NR and polymers based on NR can help to meet these challenges. With its very uniform microstructure, NR has very low hysteresis and undergoes strain crystallisation, leading to very high tensile strength and resistance to tearing and abrasion. The high strength, tear resistance and resilience are suited to many engineering applications. Because of its low heat build-up and good <b>green</b> strength, <b>tack,</b> tear strength and adhesion to brassed-steel cord, large amounts of NR are used in tyres, especially in larger tyres where NR dominates. NR latex provides high strength in unfilled thin-walled products, such as condoms and gloves. Epoxidation of NR raises increases the polarity of the polymer and the glass transition temperature, while the ability to strain crystallise is retained up to about 50 % epoxidation. ENR interacts strongly with silica, without the need for coupling agents. Because of thes...|$|R
5000|$|Stitch-Face strikes again, {{this time}} {{targeting}} a deaf [...] "God-fearing woman", a Ms. Priscena Weston. In her panic, Ms. Weston runs into {{a pack of}} wolves who attack her and chase away Stitch-face. Ms. Westen is miraculously saved when a man {{whose job it is}} to hunt large animals in Alaska and who is visiting family, kills the wolves and saves Ms. Westen's life. Meanwhile, Inspector Maycraft and his partner inspector Carver are on the trail of a murderer known as the <b>green</b> <b>tack</b> killer who is believed to be Stitch-Face. Carver does not believe that but Maycraft refuses to listen.|$|E
