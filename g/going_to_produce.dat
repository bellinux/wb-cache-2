Composer Josh Kramon was {{originally}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> a noir version of a 1980s song for the theme. However, Rob Thomas was [...] "pretty much set on finding a song", and [...] "We Used to Be Friends" [...] was chosen right from the beginning. This theme was considered by TV critic Samantha Holloway to be one of [...] "the five most recognizable, sing-along-able, memorable and best theme songs". In the third season, the theme song was remixed in a softer piano style with dark and vibrant electronic beats to reflect the more noir-influenced opening credits.|$|E
500|$|The {{first attempt}} at a Goosebumps film was in 1998, which Tim Burton was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce.</b> Chris Meledandri, the {{president}} of Fox Family Films, said: [...] "I think you'll see us tackling a scale of story that would be prohibitive {{to do on the}} small screen".

Duo Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski were hired as screenwriters and wrote the original script for the film.

Composer Josh Kramon was {{originally}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> a noir version of an '80s song for the theme. However, Rob Thomas was [...] "pretty much set on finding a song", and [...] "We Used to Be Friends" [...] was chosen right from the beginning. Kramon wrote the original background music to convey the film noir themes. For the pilot, Thomas wanted [...] "a really atmospheric, kind of modern noir type of vibe", and Kramon used sounds similar to that of Air and Zero 7. Kramon used [...] "traditional sounds" [...] for the series, but also processed and filtered them. Among the instruments used were piano, vibraphone and guitar. When using an acoustic piano, Kramon would use compression so that it did not sound like a traditional piano. Live bass and percussion was also used, as Kramon did not like to program them. The main instrument used was guitar, but Kramon felt that piano was [...] "by far the most important instrument for working on TV shows, especially when you're doing everything yourself." [...] A week before choosing the sounds for the pilot, the crew had a [...] "spotting session", where they would discuss with Thomas and the producers which type of music was going to be featured. Kramon did not decide the songs to be featured, but composed and created the whole score. Since there was little orchestral music, and Kramon could play guitar, piano, bass and drums, he played the whole score without hiring a musician.|$|E
