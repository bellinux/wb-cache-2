2500|$|Meirelles chose São Paulo as {{the primary}} {{backdrop}} for Blindness, though scenes were also filmed in Osasco, Brazil; Guelph, Ontario, Canada; and Montevideo, Uruguay. With all the characters aside from <b>Julianne</b> <b>Moore's</b> character being blind, the cast was trained to simulate blindness. The director also stylized the film to reflect the lack of {{point of view that}} the characters would experience. Meirelles said several actors he talked to were intimidated by the concept of playing characters without names: [...] "I offered the film to some actors who said, 'I can't play a character with no name, with no history, with no past. With Gael (García Bernal), he said, 'I never think about the past. I just think what my character wants.'" ...|$|R
40|$|This {{audiovisual}} essay explores <b>Julianne</b> <b>Moore’s</b> on-screen {{image as}} an unconventional maternal embodiment. Throughout her career, what has considerably marked Moore’s star image is, I contend, {{not a particularly}} authentic signature in her acting style but the thematic and erotic investment in her appearances cast as maternal women of grief, ambivalence, transgression and detachment. My exploration in this video capitalizes upon this maternal erotic and treats it as the core component of Moore’s persona. Through expressive use of editing and sound, the video operates within an expository poetic mode that appropriates the tribute/compilation format and tackles different analytical scales of sampling and audiovisual interpretation in star studies. The piece attempts to articulate a performative approach to expose the thematic continuities in Moore’s performances of mothers (or mother-substitutes) and to queer the on-screen operation of her maternal image...|$|R

5|$|Six-year-old Maisie (Onata Aprile) {{lives in}} a New York {{apartment}} with her parents, Susanna (<b>Julianne</b> <b>Moore),</b> a singer in a rock band, and Beale (Steve Coogan), an international art dealer. Susanna and Beale argue with each other viciously and constantly, often ignoring Maisie and leaving her {{in the care of}} their nanny, Margo (Joanna Vanderham). Maisie does not always understand her parents' actions, such as when Susanna hires a locksmith to change the lock on the apartment's front door to keep Beale out. When they decide to separate, both parents are granted joint custody of Maisie.|$|E
5|$|The film had a {{difficult}} and occasionally troubling pre-production history. When the novel was published in 1999, The Silence of the Lambs director Jonathan Demme, screenwriter Ted Tally, and actress Jodie Foster all declined {{to be involved in}} its adaptation. Ridley Scott became attached as director after the success of Gladiator (2000), and eventually signed onto the project after reading the script pitched by Dino De Laurentiis, who produced Manhunter (1986), based on the 1981 Harris novel Red Dragon. After the departure of Foster and screenwriter Tally, <b>Julianne</b> <b>Moore</b> took on Foster's role while David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote the screenplay.|$|E
5|$|This {{episode was}} filmed on March 10, 2010. Saint Cecilia's Catholic Church in Greenpoint, Brooklyn {{served as the}} church for Floyd and Kaitlin's (Kristin McGee) wedding.

Actor Michael Sheen made his third appearance as Wesley Snipes. In addition, actors Jon Hamm and Dean Winters reprised their roles as Drew Baird and Dennis Duffy, respectively, as former boyfriends of Liz Lemon.|$|R
5|$|But Beyoncé is {{far from}} being all sentiment. Because a large part of being Beyoncé in America in 2013 is being a sexual {{creature}} and not only being unafraid of that fact, but reveling— and reveling confidently— in it. The amorphous, shifting Houston-trap-meets-Noah Shebib trunk rattler 'Partition' exemplifies this particular sentiment. On the track, the Queen Bey tells her driver to put the partition up because 'I don’t need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees'; uses Monica Lewinsky as a euphemism for her man finishing on her clothing; reveals that 'he like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty'; and repeats that it took her '45 minutes to get all dressed up / and we ain’t even gonna make it to this club'. And in maybe the wildest moment in an album full of bold moves, Beyoncé actually slips in the French translation of <b>Julianne</b> <b>Moore's</b> 'Feminists love sex' monologue from The Big Lebowski.|$|R

5|$|Casting for {{the role}} of Maisie took eight weeks. Casting {{director}} Avy Kaufman suggested about 100 young girls to McGehee and Siegel while the directors independently visited New York elementary schools to hold auditions. Six-year-old Onata Aprile auditioned relatively late, and was cast three weeks before production started. She met with two of her adult co-stars, <b>Julianne</b> <b>Moore</b> and Alexander Skarsgård, for a brief rehearsal period before filming began. Moore, who had read the film's script before directors McGehee and Siegel, was anxious about having to sing as part of her role. She prepared by meeting with music producer Peter Nashel, singer Elaine Caswell, and Alison Mosshart, the lead singer of The Kills, whose songs Moore performed in the film.|$|E
5|$|Jack and Liz {{decide to}} {{exchange}} gifts for Christmas. Meanwhile, Jack reconnects {{with a friend}} from high school, Nancy Donovan (<b>Julianne</b> <b>Moore),</b> and ponders the possibility of romance as Nancy's marriage is falling apart. When Liz ends up buying an expensive necktie that Jack already owns, they agree to spend zero dollars on their gifts. Jack gets Liz a program from her performance of The Crucible framed in wood from her high school stage — and does not reimburse his office assistant, Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy) for fuel costs. In return, Liz calls in a bomb threat to Penn Station, keeping Nancy in New York, and finally Jack arranges for Liz to fulfill her dream of meeting Larry Wilcox as Officer Jon Baker from the show CHiPs.|$|E
5|$|On {{the weekend}} of Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) 51st birthday, his {{advances}} with CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) are called into question when he learns that his high school sweetheart, Nancy Donovan (<b>Julianne</b> <b>Moore),</b> has finally been divorced from her husband. Jack spends evenings having dinner and wine with both, against Liz Lemon's (Tina Fey) suggestion {{that it is a}} bad idea. He compares Nancy to actor Lee Marvin, after watching a movie marathon starring Marvin, and Avery to baseball player Derek Jeter, after he spends time with Avery at Jeter's home. He is moved by the thoughtful birthday gifts both women give him. Jack is torn between the easygoing, middle-class Nancy and his successful, wealthy counterpart Avery, and does not know whom to choose.|$|E

[...] "It was cute and nicely plotted", he wrote [...] "but it felt a little rote and familiar." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning was more positively inclined. He appreciated <b>Julianne</b> <b>Moore's</b> appearance, but he found that some of the story lines, [...] "though sprinkled with funny moments, were more successful as sweet tales made for the holiday." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was glad to see Cheyenne Jackson's Danny back on 30 Rock, and noted that the plots concerning Jack and Nancy and Kenneth and the TGS writers, respectively, were [...] "home runs".

5000|$|Gene Siskel {{stated that}} he [...] "had trouble {{accepting}} the premise of this picture because of the casual {{way in which the}} nanny is hired in an early scene by the mother", citing that the premise is unrealistic. However, he gave praise to <b>Julianne</b> <b>Moore's</b> character, saying, [...] "much more believable, is the supporting character of the mother's best friend", and that [...] "the friend is a terrific character, it's too bad she doesn't have more scenes in the picture". He mentioned that his [...] "biggest objection to Hand That Rocks the Cradle is to its scenes with the children in jeopardy or psychic pain". Siskel finally remarked that [...] "there are some fun thrills in The Hand that Rocks the Cradle to be sure, but I found a lot of it distasteful, too". Roger Ebert, however, had a higher opinion of the film, stating that he [...] "found this film worked", and that [...] "It touches on a fear and that's why it appeals to us". Ebert praised De Mornay's performance in the film, saying [...] "she does, I think, a very good job, a very, very sound job of being the villainess in this film and I think it's an effective performance", and that he found the scenes of the children [...] "very interesting because I saw them as a portrait of the evil of that woman" ...|$|R
