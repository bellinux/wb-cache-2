One is the International Code Council?s (ICC) 2000 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) (ICC 1999 a,b) (87 - 4 - 4. 1. 6). The second is an exception (replacement) for Chapter 11 of the ICC International Residential <b>Code</b> (<b>IRC)</b> (87 - 4 - 4. 1. 7). The West Virginia Energy Efficiency Program, West Virginia Development Office, has asked the U. S.

5000|$|Both {{types of}} homes - {{manufactured}} and modular - are {{commonly referred to}} as factory-built housing, but they are not identical. Modular homes are built to <b>IRC</b> <b>code.</b> Modular homes can be transported on flatbed trucks rather than being towed, and can lack axles and an automotive-type frame. However, some modular houses are towed behind a semi-truck or toter on a frame similar to that of a trailer. The house is usually in two pieces and is hauled by two separate trucks. Each frame has five or more axles, {{depending on the size of}} the house. Once the house has reached its location, the axles and the tongue of the frame are then removed, and the house is set on a concrete foundation by a large crane. Some modern modular homes, once fully assembled, are indistinguishable from site-built homes. In addition, modular homes: ...|$|R

3000|$|In our {{previous}} publication [13], we introduced a BICM-ID technique that uses even simpler codes, single parity check code (SPC) and irregular repetition <b>code</b> (<b>IRC),</b> combined with EM. For the notation simplicity, we refer our proposed BICM-ID structure in [13] to as SPC-and-IRC aided BICM-ID with EM (SI-BICM-ID-EM). We investigated in [14] that linear programming (LP) technique {{can be applied}} for SI-BICM-ID-EM to determine the optimal degree allocations for the <b>IRC</b> <b>code</b> {{with the aim of}} achieving desired convergence property. Moreover, in [15] we proposed a combined use of modulation doping (MD), originally proposed in [16, 17], which mixes the labeling rules for the extended non-Gray mapping and the standard Gray mapping at a certain ratio. The technique proposed in [15] helps the left-most point of the demapper slightly be lifted up to initiate the LLR exchange between the demapper and the decoder. This technique gives the additional degree-of-freedom in [...] "bending" [...] the shape of the demapper EXIT curve by choosing the mixing ratio and hence the left-most point of the demapper EXIT curve can be flexibly lifted up/pushed down. This article proposes a combined use of SI-BICM-ID-EM with D-ACC and MD. The D-ACC aided SI-BICM-ID-EM is referred to as DSI-BICM-ID-EM, and MD aided DSI-BICM-ID-EM is referred to as MDSI-BICM-ID-EM later on.|$|R
40|$|The design {{methodology}} for flexible pavements needs {{to address the}} mechanisms of pavement failure, loading intensities and also develop suitable approaches for evaluation of pavement performance. In the recent years, the use of geocells to improve pavement performance has been receiving considerable attention. This paper studies the influence of geocells on the required thickness of pavements by placing it below the granular layers (base and sub-base) and above the subgrade. The reduction in thickness here refers to {{the reduction in the}} thickness of the GSB (Granular Sub-base) layer, with a possibility of altogether getting rid of it. To facilitate the analysis, a simple linear elastic approach is used, considering six of the sections as given in the Indian Roads Congress (<b>IRC)</b> <b>code.</b> All the analysis was done using the pavement analysis package KENPAVE. The results show that the use of geocells enables a reduction in pavement thickness...|$|R

The roads from NH- 5 junction to kommadi village, NH- 5 to Navodhaya School, {{are located in}} Visakhapatnam city in India. Particularly these areas are densely populated and occupied with housing units, schools and commercial buildings. As these roads could not meet the present & and future demand, new road proposals was put forward by Visakhapatnam development authority (VUDA) to widen the existing road to master plan road. The present condition of the road is in deteriorated state which is sacrificed and new pavement design is proposed according to IRC- 37 : 2001 recommendations. The studies involves collection of details such as road width, gradient, deflection angle, length of curve and radius of curve and design them to the prescribed standards of <b>IRC</b> <b>code.</b> The curve parameters have been measured using theodolite by traversing along center line of the curve.

The old UBC (Uniform Building Code) and newer ICC (IBC and <b>IRC)</b> [...] <b>codes</b> state that a 4” sphere shall not pass through any portion of a barrier on a guardrail. In a horizontal or vertical cable rail, the cables, once tensioned must be rigid enough to prevent a 4-inch sphere passing through it.

40|$|Bituminous Concrete (BC) is a {{composite}} material mostly used in construction projects like road surfacing, airports, parking lots etc. It consists of asphalt or bitumen (used as a binder) and mineral aggregate which are mixed together & laid down in layers then compacted. Now a days, the steady increment in high traffic intensity in terms of commercial vehicles, and the significant variation in daily and seasonal temperature {{put us in a}} demanding situation to think of some alternatives for the improvisation of the pavement characteristics and quality by applying some necessary modifications which shall satisfy both the strength as well as economical aspects. Also considering the environmental approach, due to excessive use of polythenes in day to day business, the pollution to the environment is enormous. Since the polythenes are not biodegradable, the need of the current hour is to use the waste polythene in some beneficial purposes. This paper presents a research conducted to study the behavior of BC mix modified with waste polythene. Various percentages of polythene are used for preparation of mixes with a selected aggregate grading as given in the <b>IRC</b> <b>Code.</b> The role of polythene in the mix is studied for various engineering properties by preparing Marshall samples of BC mixtures with and without polymer. Marshall properties such as stability, flow value, unit weight, air voids are used to determine optimum polythene content for the given grade of bitumen (80 / 100). ...|$|R
40|$|In {{interlocking}} {{concrete block}} pavement, the blocks {{make up the}} wearing surface and are a major load-spreading component of the pavement. It differs from other conventional form of pavement that the wearing surface is made from small paving units embedded and joined in sand rather than continuous paving. Beneath the bedding sand the substructure {{is similar to that}} of a flexible pavement. The interlocking concrete block pavement (ICBP) has gained rapid popularity in many foreign countries as an alternative to concrete and asphalt pavements. However the manifest advantages of ICBP has not fully extended in India because of lack of proven indigenous design and construction information. There are not any <b>IRC</b> <b>codes</b> or IS codes available for specification and design of it. This paper presents the results of a series of tests conducted to assess the influence of block shape, thickness, size, compressive strength, and laying pattern on the overall pavement performance. The test setup discussed here was used to study these factors based on static plate loading. The effect of load repletion on the pavement behavior is discussed. The mechanism of load transfer, the effect bedding sand, jointing sand and edge restraints are discussed. The behavior of test pavement is characterized in terms of deflection. The applied load was increased in 10 KN increments from zero to one half the single axle legal limits. It is found that shape, size, thickness of block have a significant influence on the behavior of concrete block pavement...|$|R
