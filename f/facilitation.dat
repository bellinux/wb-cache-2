5|$|The {{plan was}} first {{presented}} to the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milošević. Milošević found the plan wholly acceptable and promised he would ensure {{the leadership of the}} RSK eventually supported it. He endorsed the plan because it ensured the preservation of Serbian territorial gains of 1991, retained Croatian Serb administration of the areas where the peacekeepers would be deployed and allowed the JNA to shift its focus to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Vance then met Yugoslav defence minister JNA General Veljko Kadijević, who also endorsed the plan and was apparently urged by Milošević to do so. After the plan was accepted by Croatian President Franjo Tuđman, the Geneva Accord was signed by Tuđman, Milošević and Kadijević in Geneva, Switzerland, on 23 November 1991. The Accord was a precondition for the deployment of the UN peacekeeping force. It comprised four provisions; the end of the Croatian blockade of JNA barracks, the withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the implementation of a ceasefire and the <b>facilitation</b> of the delivery of humanitarian aid.|$|E

25|$|<b>Facilitation</b> is a {{significant}} ecological process that produces community-level effects through individual interactions. By improving dispersal, increasing access to resources, and providing protection from stress, predation, and competition, <b>facilitation</b> can impact community structure, diversity, and invasibility. Incorporation of <b>facilitation</b> into such classic theories as natural selection and niche separation should be a goal of current and future ecologists. This will require further research into the mechanisms of <b>facilitation</b> {{at the level of}} individuals, and the impacts of <b>facilitation</b> at the level of population, community, and ecosystem.

25|$|<b>Facilitation</b> affects {{community}} diversity (defined in {{this context}} {{as the number of}} species in the community) by altering competitive interactions. For example, intertidal mussels increase total community species diversity by displacing competitive large sessile species such as seaweed and barnacles. Although the mussels decrease diversity of primary space holders (i.e., large sessile species), a larger number of invertebrate species are associated with mussel beds than with other primary space holders, so total species diversity is higher when mussels are present. The effect of <b>facilitation</b> on diversity could also be reversed, if the <b>facilitation</b> creates a competitive dominance that excludes more species than it permits.|$|E

The author emphasizes that although remission of contribution payables has a tangible impact on social insurance finances, postponing payment or arrangement of payment in installments is of symbolic significance.
