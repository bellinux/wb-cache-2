The processing of these materials begins with {{the definition of the}} architecture of the carbon fiber reinforcement, in the form of stacked plies or in the form of fabrics or multidirectional reinforcement. Incorporating fiber reinforcement into the carbon matrix, by filling the voids and interstices, leads to the densification of the material and a continuous increase in density. There are two principal processing routes for obtaining these materials: liquid phase processing and <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> <b>processing.</b> In both cases, thermal processes lead to the formation of a carbon matrix with specific properties related to their precursor.

40|$|Cloud and fog {{droplets}} efficiently scavenge {{and process}} water-soluble compounds and thus modify the chemical {{composition of the}} <b>gas</b> and particle <b>phases.</b> The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the aqueous phase reach concentrations {{on the order of}} ~ 10 mg C L&minus; 1 which is typically on the same order of magnitude as the sum of inorganic anions. Aldehydes and carboxylic acids typically comprise a large fraction of DOC because of their high solubility. The dissolution of species in the aqueous phase can lead to (i) the removal of species from the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> preventing their <b>processing</b> by <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> reactions (e. g. photolysis of aldehydes) and (ii) the formation of unique products that do not have any efficient <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> sources (e. g. dicarboxylic acids). We present measurements of DOC and select aldehydes in fog water at high elevation and intercepted clouds in a biogenically-impacted location (Whistler, Canada) and in fog water in a more polluted area (Davis, CA). Concentrations of formaldehyde, glyoxal and methylglyoxal were in the micromolar range and comprised &le; 2 % each individually of the DOC. Comparison of the DOC and aldehyde concentrations to those at other locations shows good agreement and reveals highest levels for both in anthropogenically impacted regions. Based on this overview, we conclude that the fraction of organic carbon (dissolved and insoluble inclusions) in the aqueous phase comprises 1 –~ 40 % of total organic carbon. Higher values are observed to be associated with aged air masses where organics are expected to be more highly oxidized and thus more soluble. Accordingly, the aqueous/gas partitioning ratio expressed here as an effective Henry's law constant for DOC (KH*DOC) increases by an order of magnitude from 7 &times; 10 3 M atm&minus; 1 to 7 &times; 10 4 M atm&minus; 1 during the ageing of air masses. The measurements are accompanied by photochemical box model simulations. They suggest that the scavenging of aldehydes by the aqueous phase can reduce HO 2 <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> levels by two orders of magnitude due to a weaker net source of HO 2 production from aldehyde photolysis in the <b>gas</b> <b>phase.</b> Despite the high solubility of dialdehydes (glyoxal, methylglyoxal), their impact on the HO 2 budget by scavenging is < 10 % of that of formaldehyde. The overview of DOC and aldehyde measurements presented here reveals that clouds and fogs can be efficient sinks for organics, with increasing importance in aged air masses. Even though aldehydes, specifically formaldehyde, only comprise ~ 1 % of DOC, their scavenging and processing in the aqueous phase might translate into significant effects on the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere...|$|R

40|$|The {{chemistry}} of atmospheric aerosol surfaces is currently not well understood. Important remaining questions concern the {{modification of the}} aerosol surfaces during ageing, the removal of trace gases from the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> and the <b>processing</b> in the hydrological cycle. Mineral dust and soot have been chosen as typical heterogeneous surfaces, which are ubiquitous in the atmosphere, {{and the role of}} which is still not very well understood. In this work these surfaces have been characterized in terms of two important issues: Hydrophilicity of atmospheric surfaces: Hydrophilicity is a critical but difficult to quantify parameter, characterizing the possibility of aerosol particles to act as cloud/ice condensation nuclei. Therefore, adsorption and desorption rates together with the amount of water adsorbed, are important parameters in the assessment of the hydrophilicity. Regarding this issue we have studied the interaction of mineral dust and kerosene soot surfaces with water vapour in the temperature interval 203 K < T < 298 K using a Knudsen cell reactor. A comparison of the uptake kinetics and adsorption enthalpies of water on mineral dust and soot leads to the conclusion that water is interacting with mineral dust much stronger than with soot. In terms of the hydrophilicity concept the results suggest, that mineral dust may be regarded as hydrophilic whereas soot is hydrophobic and that fundamental kinetic and thermo-chemical parameters may be used to quantify this concept. Reactivity of atmospheric surfaces: We have investigated two different types of soot samples (kerosene and ethene) and their behaviour towards NO 2 and SO 2 (as typical atmospheric pollutants) in a wide temperature interval between 180 K < T < 670 K. It has been found that under these conditions SO 2 undergoes only reversible adsorption/desorption on the surface, whereas for temperatures above 300 K NO 2 adsorbs irreversibly on the surface and reacts further leading to the formation of NO and HONO as <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> products with strongly temperature dependent yields. Complementary, for temperatures above 470 K, the formation of CO 2 as <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> product is observed. For the mechanistic interpretation of the reaction we have found that NO 2 adsorbs irreversibly on the surface, followed by further formation of HONO or reduction to NO (depending on temperature). Additionally, due to the reduction to NO, a new oxidised surface site is formed at higher temperatures, which releases CO 2 into the <b>gas</b> <b>phase,</b> indicating the ability of NO 2 to oxidize the soot sample followed by the consumption of soot...|$|R

Heat exchangers, separators, scrubbers, compressors and other equipment units are critical for the proper operation of the processing plant. The hydrocarbon stream received at the first production separator is a mixed stream comprising oil, water and <b>gas</b> <b>phase.</b> This mixed stream is processed in order to separate the oil dominated, water dominated and <b>gas</b> <b>phase.</b> The <b>processing</b> systems for hydrocarbon separation consists of individual equipment units which are mapped {{together to form a}} network along with all the necessary process and operational parameters like inlet and outlet pressure and temperature, flow rates, compositional data and vapour fraction details. Modifying the process parameters on an individual equipment unit, impacts the process and operational parameters of subsequent downstream equipment units. Changing heat exchanger parameters has visible impacts on the operation of downstream equipments and also on the product specifications. Insufficient cooling of the gas stream reduces compressor efficiency, insufficient heating results in lesser quantities of gas bubbling out in the 3 phase separators and also insufficient cooling causes lesser condensate extraction from scrubber units, upstream of the compressor units. For the varied heating and cooling applications on an oil and gas topside system, shell and tube exchangers, plate frame heat exchangers and printed circuit heat exchangers are the common configurations used in the industry. Shell and tube exchangers have a robust design and can handle most kinds of process fluids across a large pressure and temperature range. Plate frame exchangers are the preferred choice for topside applications compared to shell and tube exchangers considering the cost benefit owing to weight the footprint savings. However, the operating pressure and temperature are a limiting factor for plate frame exchanger applications. Process fluids only within the range of 35 barg and 200 oC can be processed in this type of exchanger. Printed circuit heat exchangers are specially designed compact heat exchangers that have a very high heat transfer effective surface area which allows this type of exchanger to handle large heating duty demands. The compact design of printed circuit exchangers gives them a low weight and footprint factor. While doing thermal design calculations for shell and tube heat exchangers, factors like L/D ratio, RhoV 2 factor, vibration factor, shell side and tube side fluid velocity, effective surface area per shell, allowable and actual pressure drop values, heat duty and LMTD need to be analyzed in order to achieve an optimum design of the heat exchanger. </p...|$|R
