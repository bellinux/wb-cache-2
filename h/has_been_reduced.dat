5|$|Arctic terns are {{considered}} threatened or {{a species of}} concern in certain states. They are also among the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds applies. The species reduced population in New England in the late nineteenth-century because of hunting for the millinery trade. Exploitation continues today in western Greenland, where {{the population of the}} species <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> greatly since 1950.|$|E

5|$|Belarus {{was once}} a major center of European Jews, with 10% of the {{population}} being Jewish. But since the mid-20th century, the number of Jews <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> by the Holocaust, deportation, and emigration, so that today {{it is a very}} small minority of less than one percent. The Lipka Tatars, numbering over 15,000, are predominantly Muslims. According to Article 16 of the Constitution, Belarus has no official religion. While the freedom of worship is granted in the same article, religious organizations deemed harmful to the government or social order can be prohibited.|$|E

5|$|Effects {{are not all}} negative; for example, {{wind farms}} produce {{renewable}} energy, helping to mitigate the single greatest threat to birds, climate change. But, especially if wind farms are poorly sited, they may affect bird populations through disturbance, direct or indirect habitat loss, and collisions. Well sited wind farms benefit birds; poorly sited ones can kill many birds in collisions. For example, at the Altamont Pass in California, the golden eagle <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> by 80%, and nesting has ceased in the area. Thus, there is a trade-off in the siting of any wind farm.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Boris Chirikov and Vitaly Vecheslavov {{performed}} {{an analysis of}} 46 apparitions of Halley's Comet taken from historical records and computer simulations. These studies showed that its dynamics were chaotic and unpredictable on long timescales. Halley's projected lifetime could be as long as 10million years. More recent work suggests that Halley will evaporate, or split in two, {{within the next few}} tens of thousands of years, or will be ejected from the Solar System within a few hundred thousand years. Observations by D.W. Hughes suggest that Halley's nucleus <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> in mass by 80–90% over the last 2000–3000 revolutions.|$|E

5|$|On July 27, 2016, in its {{quarterly}} {{report to the}} Securities and Exchange Commission, Boeing discussed the potential termination of 747 production due to insufficient demand and market for the aircraft. With a firm order backlog of 21 aircraft and a production rate of six per year, program accounting <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> to 1,555 aircraft, and the 747 line could be closed {{in the third quarter}} of 2019. In October 2016, UPS Airlines ordered 14 -8Fs to add capacity, along with 14 options, which doubles its official backlog of 15 – including some to refractory airlines – and could extend production by two more years.|$|E
5|$|Since 1971, {{additional}} amendments {{have been}} passed by the General Assembly {{and approved by the}} voter to conform to provisions in the U.S. Constitution, rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court and Congressional statute. The voting age <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> to eighteen, voting residency requirements have been removed, and voter registration conforms to the Motor Voter Act. Additionally, the Virginia Constitution now provides for a General Assembly session following a governor’s veto, and {{the right of the people}} to hunt, fish and harvest game is guaranteed. In 2006, Virginians passed an amendment limiting marriage to “unions between one man and one woman”. That has since been overturned by Obergefell v. Hodges (2015).|$|E
5|$|The precise {{mechanisms}} of bubble formation {{and the damage}} they cause {{has been the subject}} of medical research for a considerable time and several hypotheses have been advanced and tested.

The hair loss occurs at around {{six months of}} age, affecting the neck, thighs and tail; however the frequency <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> through work conducted by the breed clubs. Hip dysplasia is seen in around 8.3% of the breed, according to surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals over a twenty five-year period between 1974 and 1999. This {{was one of the}} lower results of the sporting breeds, with Greyhounds coming lowest with 3.4%, and the related Boykin Spaniel coming in second highest at 47%. There was no evidence of elbow dysplasia found. The breed has an average life span of 1013 years.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the large}} number of {{introduced}} species that harm Lord Howe's native flora and fauna, feral pigs and cats were eradicated by the early 2000s. The goat population <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> to just a few animals, and there are ongoing efforts to control rodents and introduced plants. In July 2012 it was announced by the Australian federal Environment Minister Tony Burke and the New South Wales Environment Minister Robyn Parker that the Australian and NSW Governments would each contribute 50% of the estimated A$9 million cost of implementing a rodent eradication plan for the island, using aerial deployment of poison baits. The plan was put to a local vote and is considered controversial. A recovery program has restored the Lord Howe woodhen numbers from only 20 in 1970 to about 200 in 2000, which is close to carrying capacity.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{storage in}} the Pushkar Lake <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> alarmingly, {{leaving only a}} small puddle of water in many years during the festival season when pilgrims flock to the lake for sacred bathing during the Hindu holy month of Kartik, when the Pushkar Fair is held. During the 2009 Pushkar fair, the {{situation}} became very grim when the lake dried up entirely. Alternate arrangements were made to facilitate sacred bathing by providing water in concrete tanks {{near one of the}} upper ghats, fed by tube wells from ground water sources. While the authorities have been blamed for poor planning by de-silting the lake, the drought situation has resulted in insignificant rainfall in the area to fill the lake.|$|E

5|$|In {{the three}} decades {{following}} 1969, {{the army was}} heavily deployed in Northern Ireland's Operation Banner to support the Royal Ulster Constabulary (later the Police Service of Northern Ireland) in their conflict with republican paramilitary groups. The locally recruited Ulster Defence Regiment was formed, becoming home-service battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment in 1992 before it was disbanded in 2006. Over 700 soldiers were killed during the Troubles. Following the 1994–1996 IRA ceasefires and since 1997, demilitarisation {{has been part of}} the peace process and the military presence <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced.</b> On 25 June 2007 the 2nd Battalion of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment left the army complex in Bessbrook, County Armagh, ending the longest operation in British Army history.|$|E
5|$|Living chelicerates {{have both}} {{compound}} eyes (only in horseshoe crabs, as the compound {{eye in the}} other clades <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> to a cluster {{of no more than}} five pairs of ocelli), mounted {{on the sides of the}} head, plus pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes"), mounted in the middle. These median ocelli-type eyes in chelicerates are assumed to be homologous with the crustacean nauplius eyes and the insect ocelli. The eyes of horseshoe crabs can detect movement but not form images. At the other extreme, jumping spiders have a very wide field of vision, and their main eyes are ten times as acute as those of dragonflies and is able to see in both colors and UV-light.|$|E
5|$|Off South Africa, {{the round}} ribbontail ray is {{captured}} incidentally by prawn trawlers on offshore banks, {{but is not}} utilized. Because of its size and strength, it is also prized by sport anglers, who usually release it unharmed. South Africa sets a recreational bag limit of one ray per species per person per day, and does not allow spearfishing for this species. In Australian waters, this ray has been assessed as of Least Concern. Although it is caught (and discarded) by prawn trawlers, this mortality <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> by the mandatory installation of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs). Furthermore, a portion of its Australian range lies within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. This species has also been listed under Least Concern in the Maldives where, due to the tourist value of rays, the government has created protected marine reserves and banned the export of rays in 1995 and ray skins in 1996.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{construction}} of the Canning Dam, among other drinking water supply dams, water flow into the Canning River <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> by up to 96%. A number of freshwater fish species which are endemic to the south-west of Western Australia are found in the Canning River system, however studies of fish and fish habitats in the area have shown that fish numbers are low due to a loss of habitat and a loss of linkage between breeding areas due to low flows, preventing fish migrating upstream and reaching important breeding and nursery grounds. Stagnant water caused by a lack of water flow has provided a suitable habitat for successful breeding of an introduced pest, the mosquitofish.|$|E
5|$|The {{beautiful}} nuthatch {{has always}} been rare and very localized throughout its distribution, perhaps due to very specific ecological requirements, though this has been questioned as not {{in keeping with the}} diversity of habitats in which S. formosa has been observed. Although the species is less threatened at high elevations, its habitat <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> by deforestation, due to logging and forest clearance to make way for human habitation. In the center of Laos and northern Vietnam, Fokienia trees, which are a known beautiful nuthatch foraging source and nesting site, are harvested for their high commercial value. Research conducted in 2001 indicated a population comprising 2,500 to 10,000 adults, and between 3,500 and 15,000 total individuals; these numbers are in decline. The species has been classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|The men's hammer throw {{became an}} Olympic event in 1900 but the women's event – using a 4kg (8.82lb) weight – was not widely competed until much later, finally {{featuring}} on the women's Olympic programme in 2000. The distances thrown by male athletes became greater from the 1950s onwards {{as a result}} of improved equipment using the denser metals, a switch to concrete throwing areas, and more advanced training techniques. Professional hammer throwers as historically large, strong, sturdy athletes. However, qualities such as refined technique, speed and flexibility have become increasingly important in the modern era as the legal throwing area <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> from 90 to 34.92 degrees and throwing technique involves three to four controlled rotations.|$|E
