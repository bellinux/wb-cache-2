25|$|The main {{impregnation}} {{techniques are}} wet impregnation and dry impregnation. During wet impregnation, the porous particles are dissolved in the <b>extractant</b> {{and allowed to}} soak with the respective fluid. In this approach, the particles are either contacted with a precalculated amount of <b>extractant,</b> which completely soaks into the porous matrix, or the particles are contacted with an excess of <b>extractant.</b> After soaking, the remaining <b>extractant,</b> which is not inside the pores, is evaporated.|$|E
25|$|While during {{conventional}} {{liquid-liquid extraction}} the solvent and the <b>extractant</b> {{have to be}} dispersed, in a SIR setup the dispersion is already achieved by the impregnated particles. This also prevents an additional phase separation step, which would be necessary after the emulsification occurring in liquid-liquid extraction. In order to elucidate the effect of emulsification, Figure 2 (to the left) compares the two systems of an <b>extractant</b> in liquid-liquid equilibrium with water, left, and SIR particles in equilibrium with water, right. The figure shows that no emulsification occurs in the SIR system, whereas the liquid-liquid system shows turbidity implying emulsification. Also, the impregnation step decreases the solvent loss into the aqueous phase compared to liquid-liquid extraction. This decrease of <b>extractant</b> loss is contributed to physical sorption of the <b>extractant</b> on the particle surface, {{which means that the}} <b>extractant</b> inside the pores does not entirely behave as a bulk liquid. Depending on the pore size of the used particles, capillary forces may also play a role in retaining the <b>extractant.</b> Otherwise, van-der-Waals forces, pi-pi-interactions or hydrophobic interactions might stabilize the <b>extractant</b> inside the particle pores. However, the possible decrease of <b>extractant</b> loss depends largely on the pore size and the water solubility of the <b>extractant.</b> Nonetheless, SIRs have a significant advantage over e.g. custom made ion-exchange resins with chemically bonded ligands. SIRs can be reused for different separation tasks by just rinsing one complexing agent out and re-impregnating them with another more suitable <b>extractant.</b> This way, potentially expensive design and production steps of e.g. affinity resins can be avoided. Finally, by filling the whole volume of the particle pores with an <b>extractant</b> (complexing agent), a higher capacity for solutes can be achieved than with ordinary adsorption or ion exchange resins, where only the surface area is available.|$|E
25|$|Solvent {{impregnated}} resins (SIRs) are {{commercially available}} (macro)porous resins impregnated with a solvent/an <b>extractant.</b> In this approach, a liquid <b>extractant</b> is {{contained within the}} pores of (adsorption) particles.

The performance of these ILs as <b>extractants</b> of N compounds is compared and rationalized. It is demonstrated that the cation and anion sizes (offering more surface area for <b>extractants</b> to interact) are the major factors determining the effectiveness of N compound extraction, although hydrogen bond donor/acceptor abilities of ILs can {{also play a role}} in the removal of these N compounds. In this study, some ILs are found to dissolve a considerable amount of oil contents. This undesired property can be controlled by the size of IL ions...|$|R
40|$|Few {{investigations}} {{have been carried}} out about the comparison of desorption rate and amount of heavy metals extracted successively by organic acid mixtures mimicking the rhizosphere and routine <b>extractants</b> in sewage sludge-amended soils. Extractions of Zn, Cd, Ni, Cr, and Cu were performed in samples of a sewage sludge-amended soil using seven extractants: four organic acid mixtures and three routine <b>extractants</b> (DTPA, Mehlich-I, and ammonium acetate). Results from single pass extractions, in which the extractable metal contents were determined by simply extracting the soil a single time, as well as from 15 successive extractions, in which the solid residues of the first extraction was successively extracted 14 additional times, of heavy metals were analyzed. The extractability of heavy metals in a single pass extraction was, in general, as follows: Mehlich-I > DTPA > organic acids > NH 4 OAc. The highest rates of extraction followed the general order: DTPA > Mehlich-I > organic acids > NH 4 OAc. While Mehlich-I presented the highest extractability of heavy metals among studied <b>extractants,</b> DTPA showed a high extractability of Zn, Cd, Ni, and Cu in a single extraction as well as the highest rates of extraction among the studied <b>extractants.</b> The transfer of heavy metals from soil to organic acid solutions is slower than to DTPA and Mehlich-I <b>extractants.</b> 200...|$|R

25|$|Figure 1 to {{the right}} {{explains}} the basic principle, in which the organic <b>extractant</b> E is contained inside the pores of a porous particle. The solute S, which is initially dissolved in the aqueous phase surrounding the SIR particle, physically dissolves in the organic <b>extractant</b> phase during the extraction process. Furthermore, the solute S can react with the <b>extractant</b> to form a complex ES. This complexation of the solute with the <b>extractant</b> shifts the overall extraction equilibrium further towards the organic phase. This way, the extraction of the solute is enhanced.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} {{possible}} drawbacks of SIR technology, such as leaching of the <b>extractant</b> or clogging of a fixed bed by attrition of the particles. These might be remedied by choosing the proper particle-extractant-system. This implies selecting a suitable <b>extractant</b> with low water solubility, which is sufficiently retained inside the pores, and selecting mechanically stable particles as a solid {{support for the}} <b>extractant.</b> Additionally, SIRs can be stabilized by coating them, as shown by D.

25|$|An additional, albeit not so {{frequently}} used technique is the modifier addition method. This technique {{relies on the}} use of an extractant/solvent/modifier system.

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} {{demonstrates}} whether resins are better than conventional soil <b>extractants</b> at predicting plant metal concentrations, and whether low-cost soil treatments can effectively reduce metal content and concentrations in lettuce leaves.

Seven gas-field-produced water samples have been analyzed. From a sample (K 5 D) with average metal ion concentrations ([metaltot] = 0. 14 M), thiacalix[4]crown- 5 dicarboxylic acid (10 - 4 M) extracts 60 % of the 226 Ra 2 + content.

25|$|A {{completely}} new approach of using SIRs for the separation or purification of biotechnological {{products such as}} proteins {{is based on the}} concept of impregnating porous particles with aqueous polymer solutions developed by B. Burghoff. These so-called Tunable Aqueous Polymer-Phase Impregnated Resins (TAPPIR) enhance aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) by applying the SIR technology. During classical aqueous two-phase extraction, biotechnological components such as proteins are extracted from aqueous solutions by using a second aqueous phase. This second aqueous phase contains e.g. polyethylene glycol (PEG). On the one hand, a low density difference and low interfacial tension between the two aqueous phases facilitate comparatively fast mass transfer between the phases. On the other hand, PEG appears to stabilize the protein molecules, which results in a comparatively low protein denaturation during the extraction. However, a significant drawback of ATPE is the persistent emulsification, which makes phase separation a challenge. The idea behind TAPPIR is to use the advantages posed by SIRs, namely low <b>extractant</b> loss due to immobilization in the pores and less emulsification than in liquid-liquid extraction. This way, the drawbacks of ATPE could be remedied. The setup would consist of a packed column or a fluidized bed rather than liquid-liquid extraction equipment with additional phase separation steps. Nonetheless, as yet only first feasibility studies are on the way to prove the concept. Adrawback of this method is the non-conitnous working mode. The packed column is run similar as a chromatographic column.|$|E
