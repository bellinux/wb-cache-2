40|$|AbstractThe Shape Calculus is a {{bio-inspired}} timed {{and spatial}} calculus for describing 3 D geometrical shapes {{moving in a}} space. Shapes, combined with a behaviour, form 3 <b>D</b> <b>processes,</b> i. e., individual entities able to bind with other processes on compatible spatial channels and to split over previously established bonds. Due to geometrical space, timed behaviours, a wide degree of freedom in defining motion laws and usual nondeterminism, 3 <b>D</b> <b>processes</b> typically exhibits an infinite behaviour that prevents any decidable analysis. Shape Calculus models are currently used only for simulation and, thus, validation of models and hypothesis testing. In this work we introduce a complementary, and synergetic, way of using the calculus for systems biology purposes: we define a first abstract interpretation {{that can be used}} to verify untimed and unspatial safety properties of a given model. Such an abstraction focuses on the possible interactions that, during the evolution of the system, can occur among processes yielding new composed processes and, thus, new species.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we define a metric {{distance}} between probability distributions on two distinct finite sets of possibly different cardinalities. The metric {{is defined in}} terms of a joint distribution on the product of the two sets, which has the two given distributions as its marginals, and has minimum entropy. Computing the metric exactly turns out to be NP-hard. Therefore an efficient greedy algorithm is presented for finding an upper bound on the distance. We then study the problem of optimal order reduction in the metric defined here. It is shown that every optimal reduced order approximation must be an aggregation of the original distribution, and that optimal reduced order approximation is equivalent to finding an aggregation with maximum entropy. This problem also turns out to be NP-hard, so again a greedy algorithm is constructed for finding a suboptimal reduced order approximation. Taken together, all the results presented here permit the approximation of an i. i. <b>d.</b> <b>process</b> over a set of large cardinality by another i. i. <b>d.</b> <b>process</b> over a set of smaller cardinality. In future work, attempts will be made to extend this work to Markov processes over finite sets...|$|R
