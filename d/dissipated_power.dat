50|$|One {{drawback}} of the Baker clamp is its increased low voltage-output level (as in a Darlington transistor). In logic circuits, it {{decreases the}} noise immunity; in power applications, {{it increases the}} <b>dissipated</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
50|$|CMOS logic <b>dissipates</b> less <b>power</b> than NMOS logic {{circuits}} because CMOS <b>dissipates</b> <b>power</b> only when switching ("dynamic power"). On a typical ASIC {{in a modern}} 90 nanometer process, switching the output might take 120 picoseconds, and happens once every ten nanoseconds. NMOS logic <b>dissipates</b> <b>power</b> whenever the transistor is on, {{because there is a}} current path from Vdd to Vss through the load resistor and the n-type network.|$|R
50|$|Like other series regulators, the diode will <b>dissipate</b> <b>power</b> {{equal to}} its voltage drop times the current passing through it.|$|R
2500|$|A real {{capacitor}} {{with loss}} may be modeled {{as an ideal}} capacitor that has an equivalent series resistance (ESR) which <b>dissipates</b> <b>power</b> as the capacitor is charged or discharged. For a sinusoidal input voltage the <b>power</b> <b>dissipated</b> due to the ESR is given as: ...|$|R
50|$|Built with {{complementary}} {{metal oxide}} semiconductor (CMOS) technology, the IBM 386SLC had a 161-square millimeter die. It was available with clock speeds of 16, 20, and 25 MHz. The 25 MHz model produced only 2.5 watts of <b>dissipated</b> <b>power,</b> making it specially well suited for laptops and other portable devices.|$|E
50|$|These {{processes}} produce entropy (see entropy production) at {{a certain}} rate. The entropy production rate times ambient temperature gives the <b>dissipated</b> <b>power.</b> Important examples of irreversible processes are: heat flow through a thermal resistance, fluid flow through a flow resistance, diffusion (mixing), chemical reactions, and electrical current flow through an electrical resistance (Joule heating).|$|E
50|$|Similarly, in {{electrical}} circuits, <b>dissipated</b> <b>power</b> is typically {{proportional to the}} square of voltage or current when the impedance is held constant. Taking voltage as an example, {{this leads to the}} equation:where V is the voltage being measured, V0 is a specified reference voltage, and GdB is the power gain expressed in decibels. A similar formula holds for current.|$|E
50|$|Efficiently {{generating}} power {{becomes more}} important at high power levels. Linear Class A amplifiers are at best 25 percent efficient. Push-pull Class B amplifiers are at best 50 percent efficient. The basic problem is the amplifying element is <b>dissipating</b> <b>power.</b> Switching Class C amplifiers are nonlinear, {{but they can be}} better than 50 percent efficient because an ideal switch does not <b>dissipate</b> any <b>power.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{size and}} shape of the {{attenuator}} depends on its ability to <b>dissipate</b> <b>power.</b> RF attenuators are used as loads for and as known attenuation and protective dissipation of power in measuring RF signals.|$|R
50|$|Switching {{converters}} (such as buck converters) {{provide much}} greater power efficiency as DC-to-DC converters than linear regulators, which are simpler circuits that lower voltages by <b>dissipating</b> <b>power</b> as heat, {{but do not}} step up output current.|$|R
5000|$|The linear {{estimation}} {{model for}} DiPART requires a power sensor capable of acquiring <b>dissipated</b> <b>power</b> consumption and current measurement at run time. There are different embedded sensors like Atom-LEAP system [...] or Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Mobil Development Platforms {{that can do}} the job for DiPART. One single power sensor can be used to calibrate the subsystem level estimation model DiPART.|$|E
5000|$|The decibel volt {{reference}} voltage is 1 VRMS [...] [...] The decibel unloaded {{reference voltage}}, 0 dBu, is the AC voltage {{required to produce}} 1 mW of power across a 600 Ω impedance (approximately 0.7746 VRMS). [...] This awkward unit is a holdover from the early telephone standards, which used 600 Ω sources and loads, and measured <b>dissipated</b> <b>power</b> in decibel-milliwatts (dBm). Modern audio equipment does not use 600 Ω matched loads, hence dBm unloaded (dBu).|$|E
50|$|Estimating power {{consumption}} {{is critical for}} hardware, software developers, and other computing system users like Internet companies to save energy or to optimize their HW/SW to be more energy efficient. It is also critical because one can use the available resources accordingly. Simulators are only good during design but their estimation {{also needs to be}} verified. Simulators in general have high errors due to manufacturing of hardware components. Power meters measure {{power consumption}} for the whole system but does not give detailed breakdowns about <b>dissipated</b> <b>power</b> so designers can optimize their application or hardware. This paper analyzed different methods that researchers have discovered in recent years to resolve some of the issues above.|$|E
50|$|If the ratios do not match, {{then there}} might be {{different}} currents of PMOS and NMOS, this may lead to imbalance and thus improper flow of current causes the CMOS to heat up and <b>dissipate</b> <b>power</b> unnecessarily.|$|R
2500|$|Modern dimmers {{are built}} from {{semiconductors}} instead of variable resistors, {{because they have}} higher efficiency. A variable resistor would <b>dissipate</b> <b>power</b> as heat and acts as a voltage divider. Since semiconductor or solid-state dimmers switch quickly between a low resistance [...] "on" [...] state and a high resistance [...] "off" [...] state, they <b>dissipate</b> very little <b>power</b> compared with the controlled load.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the power}} {{transmission}} system or mechanism does not generate power, its ideal performance occurs when the output power equals the input power, that is, {{when there are no}} losses. Real devices <b>dissipate</b> <b>power</b> through friction, part deformation and wear.|$|R
50|$|Miniaturizing {{components}} {{has always}} been a primary goal in the semiconductor industry because it cuts production cost and lets companies build smaller computers and other devices. Miniaturization, however, has increased <b>dissipated</b> <b>power</b> per unit area and made it a key limiting factor in integrated circuit performance. Temperature increase becomes relevant for relatively small-cross-sections wires, where it may affect normal semiconductor behavior. Besides, since the generation of heat is proportional to the frequency of operation for switching circuits, fast computers have larger heat generation than slow ones, an undesired effect for chips manufacturers. This article summaries physical concepts that describe the generation and conduction of heat in an integrated circuit, and presents numerical methods that model heat transfer from a macroscopic point of view.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{drawback}} of the Darlington pair is its increased [...] "saturation" [...] voltage. The {{output transistor}} {{is not allowed}} to saturate (i.e. its base-collector junction must remain reverse-biased) because the first transistor, when saturated, establishes full (100%) parallel negative feedback between the collector and the base of the second transistor. Since collector-emitter voltage is equal to the sum of its own base-emitter voltage and the collector-emitter voltage of the first transistor, both positive quantities in normal operation, it always exceeds the base-emitter voltage. (In symbols, [...] always.) Thus the [...] "saturation" [...] voltage of a Darlington transistor is one VBE (about 0.65 V in silicon) higher than a single transistor saturation voltage, which is typically 0.1 - 0.2 V in silicon. For equal collector currents, this drawback translates to an increase in the <b>dissipated</b> <b>power</b> for the Darlington transistor over a single transistor. The increased low output level can cause troubles when TTL logic circuits are driven.|$|E

It is found that the <b>dissipated</b> <b>power</b> in general increases with increasing CH 4 concentration and decreases with increasing H 2 concentration. Optical, electrical and defective properties of films deposited under a wide range of deposition conditions have been measured and correlated with <b>dissipated</b> <b>power...</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} and cost-effective element of an efficient heating, ventilating, {{and air conditioning}} (HVAC) system is a well-insulated building. A more efficient building requires less heat generating or <b>dissipating</b> <b>power,</b> but may require more ventilation capacity to expel polluted indoor air.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a steady-state thermal simulation strategy called DJOSER, which is dedicated primarily but not exclusively to packaging structures for electronic devices. It is applicable to structures {{that can be}} likened {{to a set of}} homogeneous layers stacked {{one on top of the}} other and possibly separated by thermal contact resistances, where the <b>dissipated</b> <b>powers</b> are due to two-dimensional heat sources distributed on the interfaces between the layers. A broad range of contour conditions and types of <b>dissipated</b> <b>powers</b> is included to make the models as close as possible to the typical structures of modern assembly technologies. Flow and temperature distributions are obtained via a system of integral equations that can be translated directly, with the usual squaring techniques, into a linear algebraic system...|$|R
5000|$|For a {{reactive}} component the {{sinusoidal voltage}} across the component is in quadrature (a [...] phase difference) with the sinusoidal current through the component. The component alternately absorbs {{energy from the}} circuit and then returns energy to the circuit, thus a pure reactance does not <b>dissipate</b> <b>power.</b>|$|R

40|$|Self-heating {{effects and}} {{temperature}} rise in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs grown on silicon and sapphire substrates are studied, exploiting transistor dc characterization methods. A negative differential output resistance is observed for high <b>dissipated</b> <b>power</b> levels. An analytical formula for a source-drain current drop {{as a function}} of parasitic source resistance and threshold voltage changes is proposed to explain this behavior. The transistor source resistance and threshold voltage is determined experimentally at different elevated temperatures to construct channel temperature versus <b>dissipated</b> <b>power</b> transfer characteristic. It is found that the HEMT channel temperature increases rapidly with <b>dissipated</b> <b>power</b> and at 6 W/mm reaches values of 320 C for sapphire and 95 C for silicon substrate, respectively...|$|E
40|$|We give a semi-analytical {{method for}} the {{calculation}} of the transient power and energy dissipated in the cavity walls of an accelerating structure due to the excitation of the higher order modes by a sequence of accelerating bunches. We treat the case where more than one bunch {{is present in the}} structure at the same time. The <b>dissipated</b> <b>power</b> is evaluated using the Lagrangian formalism and the dissipation function. Both the <b>dissipated</b> <b>power</b> from the transient fields, present when the bunch is inside the cavity, and from the time harmonic fields, present when the bunch has left the cavity, are included in the evaluations. This method is applied to the six-cell elliptic medium beta cavities for the LINAC of the European Spallation Source. The simulations constitute a thorough test of the <b>dissipated</b> <b>power</b> of the design...|$|E
5000|$|Practical {{devices have}} non-zero voltage drop and <b>dissipate</b> <b>power</b> when on, {{and take some}} time to pass through an active region until they reach the [...] "on" [...] or [...] "off" [...] state.

5000|$|... where [...] = <b>power</b> <b>dissipated</b> by {{load and}} [...] = <b>power</b> <b>dissipated</b> by the pad resistors. Large {{positive}} numbers means loss is large.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} of a {{fluctuating}} voltage V(t), the stored energy also fluctuates and hence power must flow into or out of the capacitor. This power can be found by taking the time derivative of the stored energy:A real capacitor with loss may be modeled as an ideal capacitor that has an equivalent series resistance (ESR) which <b>dissipates</b> <b>power</b> as the capacitor is charged or discharged. For a sinusoidal input voltage the <b>power</b> <b>dissipated</b> due to the ESR is given as: ...|$|R

40|$|We report {{measurements}} of global <b>dissipated</b> <b>power</b> within a turbulent flow homogeneously forced at small scale {{by a new}} forcing technique. The forcing is random in both time and space within the fluid by using magnetic particles in an alternating magnetic field. By measuring {{the growth rate of}} the fluid temperature, we show how the <b>dissipated</b> <b>power</b> is governed by the external control parameters (magnetic field, and number N of particles). We experimentally found that the mean <b>dissipated</b> <b>power</b> scales linearly with these parameters, as expected from the magnetic injected power scalings. These experimental results are well described by simple scaling arguments showing that the main origins of the energy dissipation are due to viscous turbulent friction of particles within the fluid and to the inelasticity of collisions. Finally, by measuring the particle collision statistics, we also show that the particle velocity is independent of N, and is only fixed by the magnetic "thermostat".
