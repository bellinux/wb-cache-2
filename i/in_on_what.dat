It was written by singer-songwriter Ne-Yo as well as Magnus Beite and Bernt Stray, and co-written and produced by Norwegian duo StarGate. The mid-tempo R song's lyrics revolve around Rowland [...] "assert her maturity and clue her suitors <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> won’t fly {{when it comes to}} relationships." [...] It was conceived after Rowland approached Ne-Yo to work on her third album, and asked for a record which would declare she's grown.

500|$|... "Grown Woman" [...] is {{an urban}} R song written by Ne-Yo, Magnus Beite, Bernt Stray, and Norwegian {{production}} team StarGate (who also produced the song). Jeremy Helligar of True/Slant commented {{the song was}} [...] "still {{to the left of}} what normally passes for modern R" [...] Originally revealed as [...] "Grown Ass Woman" [...] and later changed to [...] "Grown Woman," [...] the lyrics and theme of the song are based on a woman who [...] "asserts her maturity and clues her suitors <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> won’t fly when it comes to relationships." [...] The song is one of three records which Ne-Yo co-wrote for Rowland after the singer specifically approached him to pen records for her album. Its concept was devised in a brief conversation between the pair. Rowland said, [...] "'Ne-Yo asked me what I wanted to talk about,' and I replied 'I'm in a different space. Change is very comfortable for me, and I'm happy where I am'. [...] want a record that declared that I'm Grown!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Wanting {{to return}} to their sound from that {{particular}} era, after narrowing down the selection from twelve finished songs to ten that they wanted to record, the band sought to work with James [...] "Jimbo" [...] Barton, who had mixed and engineered the band's hit albums Operation: Mindcrime and Empire, and whom they had last worked with in the mid-90s, when he produced their album Promised Land. Deciding to work with Barton was [...] "a no-brainer", according to La Torre, and Rockenfield has said that Barton was really the only choice. Barton had stayed in contact with Wilton, who would often fill him <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> {{was going on in the}} band. Queensrÿche invited him to see them perform at the House of Blues in West Hollywood on November 24, 2012, where he reportedly said that the band [...] "had something really special here and he wanted to be a part of it." [...] In the studio in Seattle, he told the band: [...] "Look guys, let's just start where we left off, back in 1995". Rockenfield looks back on the collaboration, saying: [...] "Working with Jimbo [...] and the addition of Todd has revitalized the band in ways we never knew until we heard the final results" [...] and: [...] "We had the best time, and he was such a great, perfect match to make this record." ...|$|E
