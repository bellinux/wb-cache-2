5|$|Karađorđe's {{descendants}} {{adopted the}} surname Karađorđević in his honour. His murder resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>violent,</b> decades-long feud between his descendants {{and those of}} Obrenović, with the Serbian throne changing hands several times. The feud {{came to an abrupt}} end in June 1903, when rebellious Royal Serbian Army officers killed the Obrenović king, Alexander, and his wife, Queen Draga, thereby rendering the Obrenović line extinct. Karađorđe's grandson, Peter Karađorđević, then ascended to the throne. In order to tie himself to his grandfather's legacy, Peter commissioned a bronze crown cast from a piece of Karađorđe's first cannon. In addition, the Order of Karađorđe's Star was introduced as Serbia's highest state decoration. The first feature-length film to emerge from Serbia and the Balkans, whose plot revolves around Karađorđe and his actions before, during and after the First Serbian Uprising, was released in 1911. Work soon began on the construction of the Church of Saint George, a Karađorđević dynasty mausoleum at Oplenac, near Topola. In 1923, Karađorđe's head was repatriated from Greece and reunited {{with the rest of his}} body. His remains were buried in a white marble sarcophagus within the church in 1930.|$|E

5|$|Miyazaki's {{works are}} {{characterized}} by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship, {{and the difficulty of}} maintaining a pacifist ethic <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>violent</b> world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities.

In 2002, American film critic Roger Ebert suggested that Miyazaki may be the best animation filmmaker in history, praising the depth and artistry of his films.|$|E

Posted to Colón, {{he was given a}} commission as a second lieutenant in September 1962. His commanding officer in Colón was Omar Torrijos, then a Major in the National Guard.

In a 1962 incident, according to journalist John Dinges, Torrijos helped Noriega avoid legal problems after a prostitute accused Noriega of beating and raping her. Soon after, Noriega's drinking and violence obliged Torrijos to confine him to his quarters for a month. Despite Noriega's problems, Torrijos maintained their relationship, ensuring they were always in the same command; he also brought Díaz Herrera into the same unit. Díaz Herrera and Noriega became both friends and rivals for Torrijos's favor.
