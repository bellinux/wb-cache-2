5|$|The University of Virginia has a {{large number}} of social <b>fraternities.</b> This list {{includes}} active all-male <b>fraternities</b> and coeducational <b>fraternities</b> that identify themselves primarily as social organizations, as opposed to professional, service, or honor organizations. Several of these <b>fraternities</b> were founded much earlier in the university's history, but went inactive and were reestablished later on. In these cases, the establishment date reflects the date that the <b>fraternity's</b> original charter was granted.|$|R

5|$|For research, {{the filmmakers}} visited several {{colleges in the}} U.S., {{including}} Harvard University, Stanford University, and the University of Alabama, observing college architecture, student life, Greek organizations, and the teaching methods of professors and faculty.

5|$|<b>Fraternity</b> {{growth was}} {{interrupted}} by the Civil War, as men from many Southern colleges halted their studies to join the Confederate army. Many <b>fraternity</b> chapters ceased to exist during this time, but some students made efforts to preserve their fraternities as the war continued. Harry St. John Dixon, a member of Sigma Chi from the University of Virginia, joined with four other Sigma Chi brothers from other universities to form the Constantine Chapter of the <b>fraternity.</b> Created in 1864, this chapter was meant to preserve the bonds of the <b>fraternity</b> during the war, promote ties between the North and South, and ensure the fraternity's continued existence.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fraternities</b> and sororities {{have been}} a part of the {{university}} since 1840. There are over 2,500 students participating in <b>fraternities</b> and sororities, which represents approximately 11% of the undergraduate population (Uptown Campus). 52 chapters have called UC home over the years, and currently includes 39 social <b>fraternities</b> and sororities: 21 Interfraternity Council <b>fraternities,</b> 9 Panhellenic Council sororities, 7 National Pan-Hellenic Council (three <b>fraternities</b> and four sororities), and two non-affiliated (Delta Phi Lambda and Phi Sigma Rho) organizations.|$|R

25|$|The <b>fraternities</b> of the Cartellverband {{historically}} do not practise academic fencing (Mensur) {{because it}} was forbidden by the Roman Catholic Church. Academic fencing is common with the more liberal student <b>fraternities</b> that already existed in German-speaking countries. Owing to this restriction, Catholic students had to organize themselves in separate <b>fraternities.</b> The <b>fraternities</b> only accept men into the organization.|$|R

5|$|On December 1, 2011, {{following}} the death of Florida A University drum major Robert Champion, the Delta Iota chapter was placed on investigative hold pending an investigation by the national <b>fraternity.</b> In January 2012, the Tallahassee Democrat reported alleged hazing by the FAMU chapter in spring 2010. According to the allegations, two members of the FAMU band faculty were involved in a hazing incident at a professor's home in which prospective members were struck on the back and neck and forced to recite information. The fraternity's investigation was postponed at the request of FAMU due to the ongoing police investigation. The investigations cleared Delta Iota of any connection to Champion's death; Champion was not a member or prospective member of the <b>fraternity.</b> After the conclusion of both the police and <b>fraternity</b> investigations, the national council closed down the chapter because of its violations of <b>fraternity</b> policy and the uncertainty of the future of the FAMU band program. As part of the chapter's termination, 28 members, including all active and prospective members in spring 2010, were expelled from the <b>fraternity.</b> Alumni members of the chapter who were present at the hazing were also expelled. Furthermore, the Delta Iota chapter may not return to FAMU before May 2017. Members who joined the <b>fraternity</b> after spring 2010 were transferred to alumni status but cannot participate in any <b>fraternity</b> events due to the shutdown of the chapter. No criminal charges were filed due to the delay in reporting and investigation.|$|E
5|$|The Inter-Fraternity Council, or IFC, is {{the oldest}} of the Greek councils. Founded in 1934, the IFC oversees 32 social fraternities and is led by a {{governing}} board that is elected by the brothers of the member fraternities. The IFC works with the Presidents' Council, which consists of <b>fraternity</b> chapter presidents, to govern the <b>fraternity</b> community.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{members of}} college <b>fraternities</b> and sororities voluntarily elect to be branded with their fraternity/sorority letters.

5|$|Two {{national}} fraternities {{were founded}} at Jefferson College, Phi Gamma Delta in 1848 and Phi Kappa Psi in 1852. Together, they are collectively {{known as the}} Jefferson Duo. A third <b>fraternity</b> was founded at Jefferson College, Kappa Phi Lambda, but it dissolved {{after a decade of}} existence amid a dispute between chapters. In 1874, a fourth <b>fraternity</b> was founded at W, the short-lived Phi Delta Kappa. The new <b>fraternity</b> grew to several chapters before falling apart in 1880.|$|E

5|$|African Americans were {{originally}} {{admitted to the}} university in the mid-1950s, but few attended until the 1970s; fraternities at this time were generally racially and religiously segregated. Although a student <b>fraternity</b> committee emphasized the fraternities' rejection of racial discrimination, in 1969 only 5 of 578 <b>fraternity</b> pledges were black. African-American fraternities and sororities soon established chapters at the university, although they presented themselves as service organizations rather than traditional social organizations. In the mid-1970s, although some black students were {{invited to join the}} heavily white fraternities, many preferred to join their own organizations. By the fall of 1973, four black fraternities and one black sorority had established chapters on grounds.|$|E
25|$|Greek life at Willamette {{began in}} the 1920s with the {{foundation}} of several local <b>fraternities</b> and sororities. In 1942, G. Herbert Smith, a member of Beta Theta Pi, became President of Willamette, and invited national <b>fraternities</b> and sororities onto campus. The local <b>fraternities</b> were soon converted into national <b>fraternities</b> and sororities. Pi Beta Phi became the first national sorority at Willamette in 1944, and Beta Theta Pi, Sigma Chi, and Phi Delta Theta were installed in 1947. At its peak, there were six <b>fraternities</b> and five sororities at Willamette.|$|R
