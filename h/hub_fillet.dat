40|$|Fractographic study {{confirmed}} that the driving gear of the multiplicator had failed by fatigue. There was multiple fatigue crack initiation and in all the cases, the fatigue crack had initiated at the tooth root. In two cases, the teeth got fractured and lost by tooth bending fatigue. In another case, after initiation, the fatigue crack had propagated into {{the hub of the}} gear and continued propagation further along the <b>hub</b> <b>fillet.</b> After propagation to a critical length, this fatigue crack had resulted in fracturing of a segment of the gear. Following this fracture, the impact with the input gear of the gear cluster had resulted in second fracture and chewing off of remaining teeth in the driving gear. Subsequently, the gear assembly had seized leading to torsional overload failure of the quill shaft transmitting power from the AGB to the multiplicator. The fatigue failure in the driving gear appears to be stress related. Evidences suggest that probably, the load on the gear assembly was more than the usual. The power transmission system down the multiplicator needs to be examined as a whole for establishing the cause(s) for excessive load on the gear assembly...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 97 The suction-impeller (single-suction) of a 33, 500 hp, four-stage {{barrel pump}} used in boiler feed service at a fossil fuel steam plant {{experienced}} operating life ranging from 6. 0 to 19 months. Cavitation erosion on the suction surface {{and in the}} <b>hub</b> <b>fillet</b> area caused this unacceptably short life. This pump design is unique in that its suction-stage operates at an inlet tip velocity of 281 ft/sec. This tip speed, coupled with a stage pressure rise of about 1160 psi places this machine well {{into the category of}} ?high energy? pumps, and signals the need for special design attention to elements of its hydraulic design in order to provide suitable performance, reliability and operability. In a joint program with the user and the pump manufacturer, the problem was investigated, a test program conducted, redesign of the impeller completed and replacement impellers commissioned in the field. Elements of the investigation and test program included the impeller design itself, suction bay distortions and effects of distorted flow generated by the upstream piping. The redesign was accomplished through the use of sophisticated computational techniques and experimental flow visualization. The final design, referred to as a biased-wedge, was manufactured using a precision, lost wax casting process, with a special stereolithographic technique used to translate the final blade design into usable patterns. One of the final set of impellers was tested using flow visualization. The test program confirmed that the final design was free of cavitation bubbles at the baseload condition and significantly reduced vapor activity and hence damage potential at min-flow. The effects of flow distortions (on cavitation activity) presented to the impeller by the suction bay (so prevalent with the conventional design) was effectively countered by the biased-wedge design. Finally, the flow distortions (both introduction of swirl and uneven mass distribution) at the pump suction flange were modeled and tested with both conventional and biased-wedge impellers. In both cases, these distortions had no effect on the formation or collapse of cavitation vapor in the impeller eye. These conclusions are valid for only this single-suction type of configuration. The impellers have been commissioned in the field units and are currently accumulating operational hours...|$|E
40|$|The peak contact {{stresses}} {{are addressed}} that are {{developed from the}} frictionless press fit of a shaft subjected to bending into an elastically similar hub with bore rounded edges. The non-linear behavior of this progressive contact is addressed by scaling a local solution available from the literature, {{with the aid of}} intermediate, auxiliary problems extracted from the fracture mechanics realm. The title problem being linear on the global domain with both the bending couple and the interference, this problem is solved by combining the FE forecasts obtained for two separate load cases, i. e. a) the interference alone and, b) the bending couple alone. Such results are expressed in terms of a) stress intensity factors for the auxiliary FM problems, and b) hoop strain component, as sampled in the proximity of the indenting edge for both the mating members. Design formulae for the contact stresses are proposed, that account for various normalized geometrical parameters, such as the outer to inner hub radii ratio, the radius of the <b>hub</b> bore <b>fillet,</b> and the contact length. Comprehensive coefficient tables are provided as well. Finally, an error analysis for the proposed method is presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{conversion}} casting makes manufacturing major components {{much more efficient}} with regards to time and cost. The conversion cast of the adapter hub used in the Victair Mistifier is a major component that requires 8 hours to machine. The existing hub starts from steel stock and then that block of steel is placed into a CNC machine and coded in to create the adapter hub. The manufacturing method changes to a casting for the adapter hub will create a replicated part that requires 1. 5 hours of post machining. The intricate design makes a conversion to casting more effective in reducing time and costs, because the cast part will be near-net shape. The original design was redesigned to be castable {{with the addition of}} casting components onto a pattern bed to create a match plate. In order to make this project economical and the final product as close to the net design of the adapter hub, shrinkage of the material was placed into consideration and casting formulas were used to create the smallest gating system as possible. Draft angles were added to all faces of the adapter <b>hub</b> design and <b>filleted</b> edges around the overall design were added for easy removal from the casting flask. This process reduces time and costs by $ 157 while also providing H. F. Hauff, manufacturer of the Victair Mistifier, the ability the mass produce a critical component of their most sold product. This in turn should lead to reduced costs for their customers...|$|R
