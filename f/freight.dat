The <b>freight</b> service would have occurred during off-peak hours only, but simultaneous with subway service, with passenger trains running in 30-minute or one-hour headways during these times. A 1912 proposal had <b>freight</b> running at night between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., while the 1925 plans called for joint <b>freight</b> and passenger service during early mornings (5 a.m. to 6 a.m.), middays (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.), and overnights (8 p.m. to 5 a.m.).|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the planning problem faced by Logistic Service Providers (LSPs) transporting <b>freights</b> periodically, using long-haul round-trips. In each round-trip, <b>freights</b> are delivered {{and picked up}} at different locations within one region. <b>Freights</b> have time-windows and become known gradually over time. Using probabilistic knowledge about future <b>freights,</b> the LSP’s objective is to minimize costs over a multi-period horizon. We propose a look-ahead planning method using Approximate Dynamic Programming. Experiments show that our approach reduces costs up to 25. 5 % compared to a single-period optimization approach. We provide managerial insights for several intermodal long-haul round-trips settings and provide directions for further research...|$|R

40|$|Correct {{positioning}} and fastening of <b>freights</b> {{are important}} safety conditions of navigation. Unreliable positioning and fastening of <b>freights</b> results in shipwreck {{and is the}} reason for injuries and losses of human lives both in the sea and during loading and unloading. To solve the above-mentioned problems, the International Maritime Organization publishes manuals in the form of either the Assembly resolutions, or the circulars approved by Maritime Safety Committee. The correct definition of necessary quantity of lashings and their positioning has the greatest impact on safe fastening of <b>freights.</b> The sea being rough, the vessel is accelerated both in longitudinal, and vertical and prevailing cross directions. The forces created by these accelerations generate the majority of the problems in fastening. The order of calculations of the force moments and forces acting upon the <b>freights</b> being shipped by sea vessels has been shown in the article. To know the proper number of lashings the calculations of the forces acting upon the <b>freights</b> being shipped as compared with the forces holding the <b>freights</b> and taking into account the strength, the number and the fastening angle of the lashings must be made. Оption of realization of algorithm of calculation with use of the а computer program to make these calculations has been offered.

The article maps Putnam and Campbell’s arguments, locating them within the wider genealogy of socio-logical theory explaining connections between religious belonging and pro-social participation. It thickens and nuances Putnam and Campbell’s definition of moral <b>freighting</b> with reference to recent UK-based qualitative research via means of Belonging, Becoming and Participation Grids (BBP).
