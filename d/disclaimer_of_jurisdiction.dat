50|$|A <b>Disclaimer</b> <b>of</b> Opinion, {{commonly}} referred to simply as a Disclaimer, is issued when the auditor could not form and consequently refuses to present an opinion on the financial statements. This type of report is issued when the auditor tried to audit an entity but could not complete the work due to various reasons and does not issue an opinion. The <b>disclaimer</b> <b>of</b> opinion report {{can be traced back}} to 1949, when the Statement on Auditing Procedure No. 23: Recommendation Made To Clarify Accountant's Representations When Opinion Is Not Expressed was published in order to provide guidance to auditors in presenting a disclaimer.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{was prompted by}} the rise in litigation against public accountants in recent years. The purpose of the {{research was}} to examine whether (1) changes in financial structure, (2) frequency of switching auditors, and (3) frequency of qualifications to the audit report or <b>disclaimers</b> <b>of</b> opinion {{could be used to}} discriminate between engagements which do or do not result in litigation. It was hypothesized that litigate and nonlitigate companies would report significantly different changes in their financial structure during the four years preceding litigation. It was also hypothesized that litigate and nonlitigate companies could be distinguished {{on the basis of the}} frequency of switching auditors and frequency of qualifications to the audit report or <b>disclaimers</b> <b>of</b> opinion. ^ The results indicate that litigate companies, as a group, grew at a faster rate in both asset base and cost of sales than their nonlitigate counterparts. There appeared to be no significant difference in the frequencies with which litigate and nonlitigate companies switched auditors. The results showed that litigate companies tended to have a higher frequency of qualifications to the audit report or <b>disclaimers</b> <b>of</b> opinion than nonlitigate companies. ^ The results of the research indicated that it may be possible to operationally define a benchmark which public accountants could use to assess the risk of litigation associated with specific engagements. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} hypothesizes {{and tests}} {{a model of}} how children process and make sense <b>of</b> <b>disclaimers</b> in television advertisements. An experimental design is employed to examine the effect <b>of</b> <b>disclaimer</b> explicitness on preschool children 2 ̆ 7 s understanding <b>of</b> <b>disclaimer</b> messages while controlling for other potentially influential factors such as prior familiarity with products advertised, level of cognitive development and attention to disclaimers. This study also examines {{the degree to which}} children use their understanding <b>of</b> <b>disclaimer</b> messages to update their expectations of the capabilities or limitations of products advertised. A causal model is tested and the results suggest that disclaimer wording influences attention to disclaimers, but that more simply worded disclaimers do not guarantee better understanding <b>of</b> <b>disclaimer</b> messages as prior research has suggested. Instead, level of cognitive development has a greater impact on understanding <b>of</b> <b>disclaimers</b> than does disclaimer explicitness. ...|$|R
