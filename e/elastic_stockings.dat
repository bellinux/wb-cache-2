40|$|International audienceObjective To {{study of}} the microcirculatory effects of <b>elastic</b> {{compression}} <b>stockings.</b> Materials and methods In phlebology, laser Doppler techniques (flux or imaging) are widely used to investigate cutaneous microcirculation. It is a method used to explore microcirculation by detecting blood flow in skin capillaries. Flux and imaging instruments evaluate, non-invasively in real-time, the perfusion of cutaneous micro vessels. Such tools, well known by the vascular community, are not really suitable to our protocol which requires evaluation through the <b>elastic</b> compression <b>stockings</b> fabric. Therefore, we involve another instrument, called the Hematron (developed by Insa-Lyon, Biomedical Sensor Group, Nanotechnologies Institute of Lyon), to investigate the relationship between skin microcirculatory activities and external compression provided by <b>elastic</b> compression <b>stockings.</b> The Hematron measurement principle {{is based on the}} monitoring of the skin’s thermal conductivity. This clinical study examined a group of 30 female subjects, aged 42 years ± 2 years, who suffer from minor symptoms of chronic venous disease, classified as C 0 s, and C 1 s (CEAP). Results The resulting figures show, subsequent to the pressure exerted by <b>elastic</b> compression <b>stockings,</b> an improvement of microcirculatory activities observed in 83 % of the subjects, and a decreased effect was detected in the remaining 17 %. Among the total population, the global average increase of the skin’s microcirculatory activities is evaluated at 7. 63 %[*]±[*] 1. 80 % (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001).

Methods The effects of <b>elastic</b> compression <b>stockings</b> on volumetric variations during the working day were evaluated for the legs of two men and 18 women (40 legs). The inclusion criterion was classification as C 0 (10 legs) or C 1 (30 legs) according to the CEAP criteria.

40|$|Objective To examine patients’ {{understanding}} of hospital-associated thrombosis, and their experiences of thromboprophylaxis. Design Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 31 patients requiring venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis following a recent hospital admission.

Participants {{were aware of}} a risk of blood clots; however, they lacked a good {{understanding of}} VTE and its components.

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the hemodynamic effect of <b>elastic</b> compression <b>stockings</b> and inelastic compression wraps on venous disease patients when both products are applied to provide the same level of compression. Utilizing the APG device (ACI Medical, San Marcos, CA, USA), venous volumes, venous filling indexes and ejection fraction measurements were captured on 10 patients with varying degrees of venous disease. Measurements were obtained for each patient at baseline (without compression), with either 30 - 40 or 20 - 30 mmHg <b>elastic</b> compression <b>stockings</b> (ECS) and an inelastic compression wrap (ICW) (Juxta-CURES tm by Circaid Medical, San Diego, CA, USA). The compression level of the ECS was measured at the B 1 point utilizing a Picopress® [Microlab Elettronica Sas, Roncaglia di Ponte San Nicolò (PD), Italy] and the ICW was adjusted to provide the exact compression level as the ECS in order to compare the effects of inelasticity versus elasticity independent of compression differences. As expected, the use of compression therapy significantly improved all measures of hemodynamics although it was found that the ICW (average static stiffness 14. 3) further improved the measures over ECS (average static stiffness 2. 4). Average venous volumes were reduced over baseline with ECS by 19 % while ICW showed a reduction of 35 %. Average venous filling indexes were reduced with ECS by 25 % and 39 % with ICW. The ejection fractions for both devices, ECS and ICW, improved an average of 27 %.

40|$|Therapy with <b>elastic</b> {{compression}} <b>stockings</b> {{has been}} the cornerstone for prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome for decades in patients after acute deep venous thrombosis. It is uncertain who benefits most from therapy, and what the optimum duration of therapy should be. We therefore aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of individualised duration of compression therapy versus the standard duration of 24 months following an initial treatment period of 6 months. We did a multicentre, randomised, single-blind, allocation-concealed, non-inferiority trial at 12 hospitals in the Netherlands and two in Italy. We randomly assigned patients (1 : 1) with acute proximal deep vein thrombosis of the leg and without pre-existent venous insufficiency (Clinical Etiological Anatomical and Pathophysiological score <C 3) to receive either individualised duration of elastic compression therapy or standard duration of therapy for 24 months following an initial treatment period of 6 months. Randomisation was done with a web-based automatic randomisation programme (TENALEA) and a random block size (2 - 12), and was stratified by centre, age, and body-mass index. In the initial phase, compression was applied within 24 h of diagnosis according to three prespecified protocols. All patients received <b>elastic</b> compression <b>stockings</b> (30 - 40 mm Hg) for 6 months, and were instructed to wear them every day during ambulant hours. Thereafter treatment was tailored {{on the basis of}} clinical signs and symptoms scored according to the Villalta post-thrombotic syndrome scale; patients assigned to individualised therapy with two consecutive Villalta scores of 4 or less were instructed to stop using the stockings. Patients were followed up for 2 years and assessed at five clinic visits at study inclusion, and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after diagnosis (stocking allocation was not revealed to the assessors). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with post-thrombotic syndrome at 24 months diagnosed according to original Villalta criteria (a score of ≥ 5 on two consecutive occasions at least 3 months apart) assessed by intention to treat. The predefined non-inferiority margin for the difference in success rates was set at 7 · 5 %. This study has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01429714. Between March 22, 2011, and July 1, 2015, we enrolled 865 patients and randomly assigned 437 to individualised duration compression stockings and 428 to standard duration. 283 (66 %) of 432 patients in the intervention group were advised before 24 months to stop wearing <b>elastic</b> compression <b>stockings</b> (236 [55 %] of 432 patients after 6 months, and 47 [11 %] of 432 at 12 months). Post-thrombotic syndrome occurred in 125 (29 %) of 432 patients receiving individualised duration of therapy and in 118 (28 %) of 424 receiving standard duration of therapy (odds ratio for difference 1 · 06, 95 % CI 0 · 78 to 1 · 44). The absolute difference was 1 · 1 % (95 % CI - 5 · 2 to 7 · 3), thus meeting the non-inferiority margin. 24 patients died, 17 (4 %) in the individualised treatment group and seven (2 %) in the standard duration group, but no deaths were related to treatment. No serious adverse events related to the intervention occurred. Individualised therapy with <b>elastic</b> compression <b>stockings</b> for the prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome was non-inferior to standard duration of therapy of 24 months.

Patients over 60 years were less likely to develop PTS than patients below the age of 30 (RR 0. 6, 95 % CI 0. 4 – 0. 9). Malignancy, surgery, minor injury, plaster cast, pregnancy or hormone use did not influence the risk of PTS neither did factor (F) V Leiden nor the prothrombin 20210 A mutation. Conclusions: PTS is a frequent complication of DVT, despite the widespread use of <b>elastic</b> compression <b>stockings.</b> Women, obese patients, patients with proximal DVT and those with varicose veins have an increased risk of PTS, whereas the elderly appeared to have a decreased risk...|$|R
40|$|<b>Elastic</b> and inelastic <b>stockings</b> or {{bandages}} {{may provide}} {{the same degree of}} compression pressure in the resting supine position but inelastic material provides much greater compression pressure in the standing or working position. For elastic compression to have the same effect in the standing or exercising state would require a degree of compression in the resting position that would be intolerable. Studies have shown that this applies to reduction of reflux and improved venous pumping although both appear to have a similar effect for reducing edema...|$|R
