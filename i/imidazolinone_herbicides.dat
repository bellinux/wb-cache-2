50|$|Imazaquin {{along with}} imazamethabenz-methyl, imazapyr, imazapic, imazethapyr, and {{imazamox}} all comprise the unique class of synthetic compounds termed the <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicides.</b> The chemical structures of these chemicals all closely resemble one another, with the compounds containing an identical imidazolinone ring structure with a carboxylic acid group {{attached to the}} backbone. They vary only in the attached ring structure. These six herbicides kill plants by inhibiting acetohydroxy acid synthase (AHAS). AHAS is the first enzyme in the branched-chain amino acid pathway that eventually ends in the synthesis of amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine.|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} of the <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicides</b> began with the synthesis of the initial lead molecule by an American Cyanamid Medical Division chemist during the 1950s. This initial lead molecule was that of phthalimide. Years later during a random screening, the molecule exhibited herbicidal activity. Although it was not known to researchers at the time, the original phthalimide was actually inhibiting the enzyme AHAS. A derivative of phthalimide showed promise when it exhibited some plant growth-regulant activity. Optimization ensued and the attempt to enable the production of field trial samples {{led to the formation}} of a tricyclic compound. The same reaction was performed on the original phthalimide, resulting in a compound that exhibited broad-spectrum herbicidal activity. Further exploration resulted in the formation of the first imidazolinone herbicide.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a breeding protocol {{that can be used to}} specifically transfer and select <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicide</b> tolerant wheat lines in segregating populations for the FS 2 gene that confers <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicide</b> tolerance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A preliminary study found that most of Nebraska winter wheat cultivars are lacking any tolerance for imazamox herbicide in the seedling stage. Two field studies in consecutive years (2000 and 2001) in Lincoln, Nebraska and screening experiment in the greenhouse for heads taken from the segregating populations after different imazamox herbicide treatments showed that using the 2 x rate of imazamox herbicide where x is the recommended herbicide rate in the field 45 g ai/ha of imazamox herbicide is the appropriate rate to remove all of the homozygous susceptible and most of the heterozygous plants without noticeable adverse affects on the homozygous tolerant plants. ^ Using the 2 x rate in an early generation in the segregating populations successfully selects for herbicide tolerance and this would allow plant breeders to select for other agronomic and quality traits in following generations. One herbicide selection treatment was needed to effectively select herbicide tolerant plants. However, two selection treatments would add an additional level of confidence should a single herbicide treatment not be completely effective (i. e. some heterozygous plants survived). Treating segregating populations for FS 2 gene with 2 x of imazamox herbicide causes plants to die and hence reduced plant density. Like many other studies in wheat, reduction of plant density caused a delay in flowering; and a reduction in plant height, grain yield, and grain volume weight. However once the susceptible and heterozygous plants are removed, the populations after spraying have full stand density and can be treated as ‘normal’ population for agronomic selection. ...|$|R

40|$|Imidazolinones {{represent}} {{a new class}} of herbicides with low mammalian toxicity that can be used at low application rates, either pre- or post-emergence for the control {{of a wide range of}} weeds in broadleaf and cereal crops, and non-crop situations. All <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicides</b> are chiral, containing two enantiomers that derive from the chiral centre of the imidazolinone ring. The inhibitory activity of the R(+) enantiomer is nearly eight times greater than that of the S(-) enantiomer. The use of <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicides</b> has increased in recent years in Australia owing to increased popularity of pulses and the introduction of imidazolinone-tolerant canola and wheat. Concerns have been raised about the potential carry over damage to the subsequent crops grown in rotation with legumes and herbicide tolerant crops. Furthermore, the presence of alkaline soils in some regions of Australia may lead to the repellence of <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicides,</b> which are chiefly present in anionic form at high pH values. Thus leaching and potential contamination of ground water may occurr when these herbicides are applied on alkaline soils in certain agroclimatic zones. There is some information in the literature on the degradation, sorption and leaching behaviour of these herbicides in the environment. However, there is little information about the behaviour of these herbicides in alkaline soils found in some areas of Australia. Until now there has been no investigation of enantioselectivity in the degradation of <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicides</b> in soils. Therefore, this study was undertaken to determine the behaviour of three <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicides</b> in solution and Australian soils including enantioselectivity in the degradation of these herbicides in Australian soils. Analytical method for these herbicides needed to be developed/improved to cater for specific experimental conditions for this study, namely the matrices containing higher levels of organic carbon and to analyse the two enantiomers of these herbicides. The extraction of imazapyr, imazethapyr and imazaquin was investigated using solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure. The evaluation of different aqueous solutions (0. 1 KCl, 0. 5 M NaOH, 0. 01 M NaOH and 0. 5 M MeOH:NaOH, (80 : 20)) showed that the recovery of all three herbicides was greater than 70 %. However, the highest level of herbicide recovery was obtained with 0. 5 M NaOH as the extraction solution. Evaluation of different solid phase extraction cartridges showed that PPL cartridge is most appropriate for the isolation and subsequent quantification of these herbicides in water and humic-amended solutions when used at pH 2. When used with soil extracts, SPE cartridges C[subscript] 18 + SCX allowed removal of co-extracting substances, resulting in high levels of herbicide recovery and accurate quantification with HPLC. These improved protocols were used in subsequent studies. The abiotic degradation of the <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicides</b> imazapyr, imazethapyr and imazaquin was investigated under controlled laboratory conditions. Hydrolysis, where it occurred, and photodegradation both followed first order kinetics for all herbicides. There was no hydrolysis of any of the herbicides in buffer solutions at pH 3 or pH 7; however, slow hydrolysis occurred at pH 9. Degradation of the herbicides in the light was considerably more rapid than in the dark with half lives for the three herbicides of 1. 8, 9. 8 and 9. 1 days for imazaquin, imazethapyr and imazapyr, respectively. The presence of humic acids in the solution reduced the rate of photodegradation for all three herbicides, with higher concentrations of humic acids generally having greater effect. The enantioselectivity of photodegradation was investigated using imazaquin, with photodegradation occurring at the same rate for both enantiomers. Abiotic degradation of <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicides</b> on the soil surface only occurred in the presence of light. The rate of degradation for all three herbicides on the soil surface was slower than in solution, with half-lives of 15. 3, 24. 6 and 30. 9 days for imazaquin, imazethapyr and imazapyr, respectively. Sterilizing the soil significantly (p < 0. 05) decreased the degradation rate of both enantiomers of <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicides,</b> with 81. 5 to 89. 5 % of each enantiomer of the two herbicides remaining unchanged. However, in non-sterilized soils, the degradation of imazapyr and imazethapyr showed enantioselectivity with faster degradation of R(+) enantiomer compared with S(-) enantiomer. There were also some differences in enantioselectivity between different soils, which could be related to variation in microbial populations and enzymes present in different soils. Soil pH had a significant effect on enantioselectivity, which could be due to the effect of this soil property on herbicide sorption and ease of its availability for microbial degradation. This aspect however needs further investigations. Results from studies on soils receiving organic amendment (lupin residue) showed that degradation of the S(-) and R(+) enantiomers of imazethapyr and imazaquin followed firstorder reaction with half-life values of 45. 9 to 105 days in non-sterilized soils for S(-) and R(+) enantiomers, respectively. Irrespective of the organic amendment, the degradation rate of the S(-) and R(+) enantiomers of the two herbicides was greater in the Roseworthy (pH 8. 2) soil compared with the Clare soil (pH 5. 2). Addition of lupin residue as organic amendment (2 % w/w) increased degradation rates of both the S(-) and R(+) enantiomers of imazethapyr and imazaquin and significantly (p < 0. 05) decreased their half-lives in the Clare soil. However, this amendment produced no significant change in degradation of enantiomers of either of the two herbicides in Roseworthy soil. The enantiomer fraction (EF) values of both herbicides increased over time, which suggested selective degradation of one enantiomer in preference to the other depending on the type of soil and amendment treatment. In the Clare soil, organic amendment increased the EF value at the end of incubation period from 0. 61 to 0. 76 for imazethapyr and from 0. 56 to 0. 66 for imazaquin, indicating enantioselective degradation of these herbicides. There was no significant increase in EF values for both herbicides in Roseworthy soil as the result of organic amendment. In conclusion, photodegradation of <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicides</b> was found to have a major impact on the behaviour of these herbicides in aqueous and soil matrices. The degradation of <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicides</b> in the soil was enantioselective, however, the enantioselectivity tended to be compound-specific and was related to soil types. The findings of this study are expected to be useful for the manufacturers to decrease the amount of chemical load in the environment. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Crop and Soil Sciences, Washington State UniversityInduced {{mutagenesis}} can be {{an effective}} way to increase variability in crop species. Crop resistance to a given herbicide can be of practical value to control weeds with efficient chemical usage. However, this type of production system with <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicides</b> imposes `plant-back' restrictions on rotational crops due to their soil residuals. In case of barley (Hordeum vulgare), a common rotational crop following wheat (Triticum aestivum), a period of 9 - 18 months is required. Thus, introduction of barley varieties showing resistance to <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicides</b> will provide greater flexibility for barley production. The objective of the research was to identify resistance in barley for <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicides</b> via induced mutagenesis. To achieve this objective, mutagenized barley cultivar Bob was screened for resistance, which identified a resistant mutant. Molecular analysis indicated a single point mutation leading to a serine 653 (AGC) to asparagine (AAC) amino acid substitution in the herbicide-binding site of the barley AHAS gene. Phenotypic characteristics of the mutant are promising and provide the basis for the release of new IMI-resistant barley cultivar(s). The acceptance of reduced-till farming in the Pacific Northwest has resulted in increased use of herbicide for weed control, as well as, increased severity of Rhizoctonia root rot. Therefore, the objective of a second study was to assess injury symptoms on barley caused by the herbicides, imazamox or propoxycarbazone-sodium combined with the root rot pathogen, Rhizoctonia solani AG 8 and to evaluate herbicide-pathogen relationships, as there are many crops that exhibit altered disease responses after application of herbicides. Negative impacts on plant growth parameters {{in the present study were}} generally caused by herbicide and/or the pathogen with interactions between them detected as well. This suggested sublethal levels of herbicides and pathogen altered severity of injury to root, and shoot dry weights and proportion of roots with disease symptoms, as the herbicide may predispose the plant to the pathogen.

The Cu(II) atom is octahedrally surrounded by four nitrogen atoms of two Himz(-) anions and two water molecules. Each Himz(-) acts as a chelating ligand by means of N pyridine and N lactam atoms leading to five-membered chelate rings. The Cu-N distances vary from 1. 948 (4) to 2. 299 (5) Angstrom while the Cu-O are 2. 114 (5) and 2. 256 (6) Angstrom. The imidazol N-H are involved in short intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate groups. The structure is stabilized by an intermolecular hydrogen-bonded network involving the water molecules and the carboxylate groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactive}} effects of vermi-compost from sewage sludge and either the sulfonylurea herbicide, rimsulfuron, or the <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicide,</b> imazethapyr, on some soil biochemical and microbiological properties were investigated. The herbicides were applied at field and 10 -fold field rates. Both herbicides exerted a detrimental effect on soil microbial biomass and its biochemical properties. Even though {{the effect of}} both herbicides on soil microbial biomass was not detectable at the field rate, some significant influences on acid and alkaline phosphatase were observed. The higher rate of herbicide application impaired the observed microbial parameters to a greater degree. The detrimental effects seemed to be reduced by organic amendments. Among the studied microbial characteristics, the specific respiration quotient was particularly reliable and sensitive in determining the influence of herbicides on the soil microbial biomass. In this paper a new synthetic index, specific hydrolytic activity (qFDA), for assessing microbial activity in reply to xenobiotic treatments is proposed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractResistance to {{sulfonylurea}} and <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicides</b> {{can occur}} by mutations in acetohydroxyacid synthase (EC 4. 1. 3. 18). Changing serine 653 to asparagine {{is known to}} cause insensitivity to imidazolinones but not to sulfonylureas. Here, S- 653 of the Arabidopsis thaliana enzyme was mutated to alanine, threonine and phenylalanine. The purified mutated enzymes resemble wild-type in their enzymatic properties. The threonine and phenylalanine mutants are imidazolinone-resistant and the latter is also slightly sulfonylurea-resistant. The alanine mutant remains sensitive to both herbicides. The {{results suggest that the}} β-hydroxyl group is not required for imidazolinone binding and that the size of the side-chain determines resistance...|$|E
40|$|Imidazolinones are chiral herbicides, {{comprised}} of two enantiomers with differential herbicidal activity. In this study, the selective degradation of enantiomers {{of the three}} <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicides,</b> imazapyr, imazethapyr and imazaquin, was determined {{in a variety of}} soils selected to cover a broad range of physico-chemical characteristics. The R(+) enantiomer of all three herbicides, which has greater herbicidal activity (up to eight times), was found to degrade faster than the less active S(-) enantiomer. The enantiomer fraction (EF) was used as a descriptor of enantio-selectivity of the <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicides.</b> The EF values increased with increasing incubation time for imidazolinones with a fast initial phase followed by a slower phase. While the enantio-selectivity was not significant in acidic soils (pH(w) 5. 02 and 5. 20), it was highly significant (P< 0. 001) in alkaline soils (pH(w) 7. 6, 8. 2 and 8. 7). Significant positive correlations of EF values of imazapyr (P< 0. 001, R(2) = 0. 41), imazethapyr (P< 0. 002, R(2) = 0. 47) and imazaquin (P< 0. 001, R(2) = 0. 54) were found with the soil pH(w) ranging from 5. 02 to 8. 7. However, no correlation of EF was found with other soil properties. In addition to showing enantioselective degradation of the three herbicides in the soils studied, the study highlighted that for imidazolinones the herbicidally more active enantiomer can be preferably degraded by microorganisms.

40|$|A rapid, {{simple and}} {{accurate}} method for the simultaneous determination of residues of the <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicides</b> (imazapyr, imazaquin, imazamethabenz and imazamethabenz-methyl) in soil is described. The {{basis of the}} method is {{the formation of a}} supernatant by sonication of the soil with 0. 1 M KCI. After removal from the soil particles, the pesticides are quantified by reversed-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with an electrospray interface (LC-ESI-MS). Recoveries from a variety of soil types, fortified over the range of 50 - 200 ppb, are essentially quantitative for each imidazolinone and the detection limits (signal-to-noise ratio = 3) of the method are always lower than 14 ng/g...|$|E
40|$|The {{sulfonylurea}} herbicide chlorsulfuron and the <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicide</b> imazaquin {{were shown}} to be noncompetitive and uncompetitive inhibitors, respectively, of purified acetolactate synthase from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) with respect to pyruvate. From double-reciprocal plots of the time-dependent biphasic inhibition by chlorsulfuron, an initial apparent inhibition constant of 68 nanomolar was calculated (a 0 to 4 minute assay {{was used for the}} initial inhibition), and a final steady-state dissociation constant of 3 nanomolar was estimated. The corresponding constants for imazaquin were 10 and 0. 55 micromolar. Specific binding of [14 C]chlorsulfuron and [14 C]imazaquin to purified acetolactate synthase from barley and partially purified enzyme from corn (Zea mays L.) could be demonstrated by gel filtration and equilibrium dialysis. Evidence is presented that the binding of the inhibitors to the enzyme follows the previously described mechanism of slow reversibility once excess inhibitor has been removed. However, after formation of the slowly reversible complex and subsequent dissociation, both chlorsulfuron and imazaquin seem to permanently inactivate acetolactate synthase. These results add a new feature to the mode of action of these herbicides with respect to their high herbicidal potency...|$|R
40|$|Acetolactate synthase (EC 4. 1. 3. 18) {{activity}} was examined in maize (Zea mays L.) endosperm and embryos {{as a function}} of kernel development. When assayed using unpurified homogenates, embryo acetolactate synthase activity appeared less sensitive to inhibition by leucine + valine and by the <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicide</b> imazapyr than endosperm acetolactate synthase activity. Evidence is presented to show that pyruvate decarboxylase contributes to apparent acetolactate synthase activity in crude embryo extracts and a modification of the acetolactate synthase assay is proposed to correct for the presence of pyruvate decarboxylase in unpurified plant homogenates. Endosperm acetolactate synthase activity increased rapidly during early kernel development, reaching a maximum of 3 micromoles acetoin per hour per endosperm at 25 days after pollination. In contrast, embryo {{activity was}} low in young kernels and steadily increased throughout development to a maximum activity of 0. 24 micromole per hour per embryo by 45 days after pollination. The sensitivity of both endosperm and embryo acetolactate synthase activities to feedback inhibition by leucine + valine did not change during kernel development. The results are compared to those found for other enzymes of nitrogen metabolism and discussed with respect to the potential roles of the embryo and endosperm in providing amino acids for storage protein synthesis...|$|R
40|$|The copper(II) {{complexes}} {{formed by}} the <b>imidazolinone</b> <b>herbicide</b> Imazapyr or (±) - 2 - 4 -isopropyl-(4 -methyl- 5 -oxo- 2 -imidazolin- 2 -yl) -nicotinic acid (H 2 imz) are described. The compounds isolated in the solid state confirm that Imazapyr is a versatile bipy-like ligand able to chelate the metal ion through two different donor sets. The pair of pyridine and imidazole nitrogen atoms is bound to copper in [Cu(Himz) 3] and [Cu(Himz) 2 (H 2 O) ]. In these, a five-coordination at the metal ion and a geometry close to the trigonal bipyramid are favoured. The weak carboxylate group does not play a primary role in the complex formation properties of Imazapyr. However, its involvement yields the polymetallic compounds [Cu(Himz) 2] and [Cu 3 (Himz) 4 (H 2 O) 4](NO 3) 2. The deprotonation of the lactam group provides Imazapyr with a stronger donor set, the lactam and the pyridine nitrogens, yielding 1 : 1 polymeric complexes [Cu(imz) (H 2 O) ] and [Cu(imz) (H 2 O) 3] · H 2 O. With the methyl ester of Imazapyr (HimzOMe), the different charge of the ligand deprotonated at the lactam group allows a bis-chelated complex [Cu(imzOMe) 2 (H 2 O) ] · H 2 O in which the metal ion adopts a five-coordination. Analogies have been established between the complexes of H 2 imz, HimzOMe and 2, 2 ′-bipyridine...|$|R
