40|$|<b>Hyperphosphataemia</b> is a {{clinical}} {{consequence of the}} advanced stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Considerable evidence points to a role of <b>hyperphosphataemia</b> in the pathogenesis of CKD-associated cardiovascular (CV) complications, including vascular calcification, and with increased all-cause and CV mortality. These observations place management of <b>hyperphosphataemia</b> at the centre of CKD treatment. Although our increased understanding of the physiological role of FGF- 23 may provide a long-term alternative biomarker of phosphate load and underlying disease progression, regular determination of serum phosphate is currently {{the most frequently used}} parameter to evaluate phosphate load in clinical practice. This review considers the challenges physicians and patients face in trying to control <b>hyperphosphataemia.</b> Amongst these are the limitations of dietary phosphate restriction, giving rise to the need for phosphate binder therapy to maintain serum phosphate control. Once the decision to use phosphate binders has been made, considerations include the relative efficacy, different potential side effects and pill burden associated with various phosphate binders. Although a number of phosphate binders are available, adherence poses a major obstacle to effective treatment. This emphasizes that further improvements to phosphate binder therapy can be made.

40|$|Three {{cases of}} {{myocardial}} fibre calcification found at post-mortem examination are described. In one case there was antemortem hypercalcaemia and <b>hyperphosphataemia</b> {{and the case}} was clearly an example of metastatic calcification. In the other two cases there was ischaemic myocardial necrosis and calcification was seen in fibres which were not overtly necrotic, but which were both in proximity to (the majority) and remote from the necrotic zones. Since renal failure with <b>hyperphosphataemia</b> was present in both cases, these {{were considered to be}} examples of augmented (by the <b>hyperphosphataemia)</b> dystrophic calcification. The histological, histochemical and ultrastructural features were identical in the three cases. Hydroxyapatite formation was observed initially in mitochondria, followed by spillage of crystals into the cytosol and ultimately into the interstitium. It is suggested that the fundamental lesion is a dysfunction of the fibre membrane; the similarity of this reaction with the calcification seen in skeletal muscle fibres in various myopathies is noted and a unifying hypothesis of the mechanism of skeletal and cardiac muscle fibre calcification is thereby suggested...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSevelamer is a non-calcium {{phosphate}} binder used {{in advanced}} {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) and in dialysis for <b>hyperphosphataemia</b> control. Several experimental, observational studies and clinical trials have shown that sevelamer has pleiotropic effects, beyond <b>hyperphosphataemia</b> control, including actions on inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid profile and atherogenesis, vascular calcification, endothelial dysfunction and the reduction of several uremic toxins.

40|$|<b>Hyperphosphataemia</b> in {{patients}} with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) {{is thought to be}} an important contributor to cardiovascular risk, in part because of endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction induced by inorganic phosphate (Pi). Such patients also have an elevated circulating concentration of pro-coagulant endothelial microparticles (MPs), leading to a pro-thrombotic state, which may contribute to acute occlusive events. It is hypothesised that <b>hyperphosphataemia</b> leads to MP formation from ECs via an elevation of intracellular Pi, which directly inhibits phosphoprotein phosphatases, triggering a global increase in phosphorylation and cytoskeletal changes. Using cultured human endothelial cells (EAhy 926), incubation with elevated extracellular Pi (2. 5 mM) led to a rise in intracellular Pi concentration within 90 min. This was mediated by PiT- 1 /slc 20 a 1 Pi transporters; and led to global accumulation of Tyr- and Ser-Thr phosphorylated proteins, a marked increase in cellular Tropomyosin- 3, plasma membrane blebbing and release of 0. 1 – 1 micron diameter MPs. The effect of Pi was independent of oxidative stress or apoptosis. Similarly, global inhibition of phosphoprotein phosphatases with orthovandate or fluoride also yielded a global protein phosphorylation response and rapid release of MPs. The Pi-induced MPs expressed VE-cadherin and superficial phosphatidylserine, and in a thrombin generation assay were significantly more pro-coagulant than particles derived from cells incubated in medium with a physiological level of Pi (1 mM). These data demonstrate a mechanism of Pi-induced cellular stress and signalling which may be widely applicable in mammalian cells; and in ECs provides a novel pathological link between <b>hyperphosphataemia,</b> generation of MPs and thrombotic risk...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is a {{heterogeneous}} group of diseases characterized by end organ unresponsiveness to parathormone (PTH), due to receptor or postreceptor defects. The characteristic biochemical disturbances include hypocalcaemia, <b>hyperphosphataemia</b> and high serum parathormone levels. Case outlineWe present a 17 -day old male baby who {{was brought to}} our hospital because of seizures. He {{was found to have}} hypocalcaemia, <b>hyperphosphataemia</b> and an elevated serum level of parathyroid hormone. The diagnosis of PHP was based on the elevated serum level of PTH during hypocalcaemia and persistence of normocalcaemia after administering alphacalcidiol with oral calcium. After 4 months of therapy, with tapering of the oral calcium doses, the treatment was discontinued. During the following six months without therapy, the infant did not have seizures and the serum levels of calcium and phosphorus were normal, so we established the final diagnosis of transient neonatal pseudohypoparathyroidism. Conclusion At the time when the newborn was diagnosed to have PHP, there was no indication whether it was of a permanent or transient form. A considerably lower number of patients have a transitory form of PHP, which is then confirmed in the infant period by a gradual reduction and withdrawal of therapy, with sustaining serum calcium and PTH within normal limits...|$|E
40|$|Background: Long-term {{exposure}} to hypercalcaemia and <b>hyperphosphataemia</b> leads to media calcification and predicts mortality {{in patients with}} end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It is debatable whether this exposure is only {{a risk factor for}} arteriosclerosis, or also for superimposed atherosclerosis. Calcium-phosphate exposure is difficult to quantify, because it is variable in time and exerts its deleterious effects only after prolonged presence. Methods: In 90 dialysis patients, calcium and phosphate values from the complete dialysis period were collected. From three-month averages, measures for calcium-phosphate exposure were derived after exclusion of transplant periods. Calcium-phosphate exposure was then related to intima-media thickness (IMT) and to ankle-brachial index (ABI) as markers of early atherosclerosis. Results: Calcium-phosphate exposure was quantified in three ways using 1670 patient-quarters (i. e. three-months periods) covering 93 % of the time on dialysis: averaged calcium-phosphate exposure, percentage of time with above-reference values, and burden of hypercalcaemia/hyperphosphataemia represented by this percentage multiplied by months on dialysis. No association was found with IMT. Patients with increased, not decreased, ABI had higher calcium-phosphate exposure throughout dialysis treatment: <b>hyperphosphataemia</b> burden was 31 (19 to 43) months for patients with ABI between 0. 90 and 1. 40 and 79 (58 to 100) months for patients with ABI > 1. 40 or incompressible ankle arteries (...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Polyethylene glycol-electrolyte {{solution}} (PEG-ELS) {{is routinely}} prescribed for bowel cleansing. Sodium phosphate (NaP) {{may be an}} effective but potentially hazardous alternative. AIM: To investigate the safety of prescription of either agent, without being informed of the patient's medical history. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients were randomly allocated to PEG-ELS or NaP. Prior to and after the bowel cleansing, blood was sampled for renal function and electrolytes. Patients answered questionnaires about complaints and ease of intake, and endoscopists rated the quality of bowel preparation. RESULTS: Eleven patients were identified with a theoretical contraindication for NaP, of whom nine should have been discovered by taking a detailed clinical history. Actually, six of them received NaP with a doubling of serum phosphate levels or hypokalaemia in four. In subjects without a contraindication {{to the use of}} NaP, <b>hyperphosphataemia</b> developed in 39 % and hypocalcaemia in 5 %. Patients tolerated NaP better and completed the preparation more often. Endoscopists rated the quality of bowel preparation equivalent, except for a better cleansed ascending colon with PEG-ELS. CONCLUSIONS: The 11 % potentially hazardous allocation to NaP and the 39 % incidence of <b>hyperphosphataemia</b> with NaP do not justify an 'over-the-counter' prescription. Taking a detailed history and, when in doubt, using PEG-ELS will safeguard against inappropriate administration of Na...|$|E
40|$|Sugestions {{are based}} on Level III and IV sources) Isolated {{phosphate}} restriction is not recommended for retarding the progression of chronic renal insufficiency. (level III evidence; single small study; clinically relevant outcome; negative effect) Background <b>Hyperphosphataemia</b> is observed {{in the majority of}} patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and has been identified as a risk factor for the progression of chronic renal failure (Klahr and Morrisey 2003). Dietary phosphorus restriction can prevent the progression of renal failure in subtotally nephrectomized rats or in rats with nephrotoxic serum nephritis, independent of protein and caloric intake. Conversely, diets high in phosphorus content result in a more rapid deterioration of renal function (Loghman-Adham 1993). The objective of this guideline is to review the evidence that correction of <b>hyperphosphataemia</b> retards the progression of renal insufficiency in the clinical setting. Search strategy Databases searched: Medline (1999 to November Week 2, 2003). MeSH terms for kidney diseases were combined with MeSH terms and text words for phosphate binders.
