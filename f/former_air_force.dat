5|$|One of {{the more}} {{immediate}} ideas for redevelopment of the base was {{to turn it into}} a federal prison, something which had been done previously at the former Carswell AFB in Texas when the Federal Medical Center, Carswell was opened on its grounds. Many other <b>former</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> facilities have had prisons opened up on their grounds as well. From the outset, there was some reluctance in the town about turning it into creating a prison culture in Limestone, but this was lessened once the government decided that it did not want to build a federal prison on the grounds of the former air base.|$|E
5|$|The CH-47Ds were {{retired as}} they became due for deep {{maintenance}} checks, {{with the last}} of the type leaving service in September 2016. Due to the large number of common components between the D and F variants, the helicopters were stripped for spare parts before being preserved in Australia. A15-202 was handed over to the Australian War Memorial in April 2016, A15-104 will be displayed at the Australian Army Flying Museum and the <b>former</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> helicopter A15-106 was transferred to the RAAF Museum. The other three surviving CH-47Ds were retained by the Army for non-flying training: A15-151 and A15-152 are used for general and special forces training respectively and A15-201 serves as a maintenance systems training airframe.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} made clear also that Joseph Kabila does not trust the military; the Republican Guard is the only {{component}} he trusts. Major General John Numbi, <b>former</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> chief, now inspector general of police, ran a parallel chain of command in the east to direct the 2009 Eastern Congo offensive, Operation Umoja Wetu; the regular chain of command was by-passed. Previously Numbi negotiated the agreement {{to carry out the}} mixage process with Laurent Nkunda. Commenting on a proposed vote of no confidence in the Minister of Defence in September 2012, Baoudin Amba Wetshi of lecongolais.cd described Ntolo as a 'scapegoat'. Wetshi said that all key military and security questions were handled in total secrecy by the President and other civil and military personalities trusted by him, such as John Numbi, Gabriel Amisi Kumba ('Tango Four'), Delphin Kahimbi, and others such as Kalev Mutond and Pierre Lumbi Okongo.|$|E

25|$|In February 1966, as anti-communist demonstrations continued, Sukarno {{tried to}} placate Suharto by {{promoting}} him.

25|$|Raviraj's {{assassination}} received condemnation {{from around}} the world. The TNA blamed the assassination on paramilitaries working with the army.

The UTHR further claimed that the assassination was carried out by the Karuna Group/Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP) {{with the assistance of the}} Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP) paramilitary group, military intelligence and a Buddhist monk affiliated with the Jathika Hela Urumaya. EPDP leader Douglas Devanananda denied any involvement in the assassination.|$|E
25|$|Chile {{was officially}} neutral during the Falklands War, but Chile's Westinghouse long range radar that was {{deployed}} {{in the south of}} the country gave the British task force early warning of Argentinian air attacks. This allowed British ships and troops in the war zone to take defensive action. Margaret Thatcher, the British prime minister {{at the time of the}} war, said that the day the radar was taken out of service for overdue maintenance was the day Argentinian fighter-bombers bombed the troopships Sir Galahad and Sir Tristram, leaving 53 dead and many injured. According to Chilean Junta member and <b>former</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> commander, General Fernando Matthei, Chilean support included military intelligence gathering, radar surveillance, allowing British aircraft to operate with Chilean colours, and facilitating the safe return of British special forces, among other forms of assistance.|$|E

A critical influence on Hitler's thinking during this period was the Aufbau Vereinigung, a conspiratorial group of White Russian exiles and early National Socialists.
