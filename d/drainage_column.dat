40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to understand the interactions between liquid and gas flow at high degrees of saturation, as this could {{have a significant effect on}} the effectiveness of landfill remediation by flushing. Particular attention is paid to two key parametric functions that are believed to control the simultaneous flow of leachate and gas in waste materials. These are the relationship between capillary pressure or suction and the degree of leachate saturation or volumetric moisture content, known as the moisture retention characteristic; and the relationship between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and moisture content. The thesis starts with a review of previous work on moisture retention characteristic curves and relative permeability functions for waste materials. New data from a <b>drainage</b> <b>column</b> experiment, pressure plate apparatus and hanging water column tests on mechanically and biologically treated (MBT) waste specimens are then presented and compared. The results from the drainage experiments have been interpreted using the unsaturated flow model HYDRUS- 1 D (Šim?nek et al., 2005) and the University of Southampton Landfill Degradation and Transport model LDAT (White et. al 2004). These results give support to the modelling concepts and the integrity of the code for both models and highlight the capabilities of single and dual porosity models. Use of the van Genuchten (1980) type curves to represent the moisture retention characteristics was found to be fruitful. The values of the parameters that control the shapes of these curves, and therefore the shape of the relationships between capillary pressure and moisture content and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and moisture content, are reviewed using both results from the literature and results from the experimental work described in the thesis. The sensitivity of the shapes to the values of the parameters is examined as is the sensitivity of the results of numerical modelling that is based on the parameter values. The relationship of the parameter values to the material dry density is also explored. Whilst the flow in the gas phase is not central to the subject of the thesis, it has been possible to make observations on the relationship between unsaturated gas permeability and moisture content. The thesis draws attention to the fact that different experimental techniques can lead to significantly different estimates of the moisture retention characteristics. Hanging column tests show an apparently sensible variation of moisture retention curve with density and are self-consistent. However a partial or full interruption of the liquid phase within the specimen, or between the specimen and the hanging column porous plate will inhibit the drainage of liquid from the specimen, resulting in an increase in the retained moisture content at a given applied external suction. This has significant implications for the study of liquid movement in unsaturated wastes. A key recommendation from the work is that the moisture retention characteristic curve for a waste is perhaps better determined from direct measurements of suction and moisture content, as in the <b>drainage</b> <b>column</b> apparatus for the suction range 0 - 10 kPa. For higher suctions carefully set up pressure plate tests are advisable...|$|E
40|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} phases in the propagation of a hydrocarbon spill into the subsurface occur in the vadose or unsaturated zone, between the land surface and the water table, and in the groundwater flow zone at its contact with the free oil phase. The last determines the dissolution and spreading of contaminants through the most mobile flow zone. The first determines the spill geometry, the amount of free phase oil that reaches the groundwater body and the total retention of spilled oil. Oil retention studies carried out for this project show whether the volume of soil within a spill site is sufficient to retain the oil without it escaping into the groundwater and also gives a rough approximation of how' long it takes for the oil phase to reach pendular saturation. Grain size and sorting distribution and are useful factors governing retention, and are useful parameters in evaluating the potential damage of an oil spill and the immediate danger of groundwater contamination. Centrifuge air-oil-water displacement provides a quick and first order approximate means to measure site-specific oil and water retention within the unsaturated zone of a porous media. Results show a semi log relationship between total primary retention and grain size (in phi units) of laboratory samples with oil-water-air systems run under 38 g in the centrifuge. A correction factor adjusts retentions to gravity <b>drainage</b> <b>column</b> pack saturations after gravity drainage used as a standard of comparison. Field samples from an oil spill site assume the same relationship when plotted against effective particle size versus total primary retention. Effective particle size has a finer resolution than mean grain size because it emphasizes {{the role of the}} fine fraction and sorting characteristics that tend to increase retention capacity.

40|$|Heavy and/or {{long-term}} continuous rainfall {{would have}} tremendous impact to crop growth and product, {{and it would}} cause the variation of vegetable market price. According to the agricultural disasters data from Taiwan agricultural yearbooks, the vegetables loss value of Yunlin prefecture, the major area of vegetable production, was above 4. 7 % of total loss in Taiwan for the last 10 years. Statistics of substitute harvest vegetable price and daily precipitation indicated that the accumulated precipitation and continuous rainy days would increase the vegetable price and the lag days of appreciation. On average, 8 days after each rainfall event could have the maximum vegetable price increase. Most of the agricultural lands in Shilo area were alluvial soils. Interlaced texture stratification within the soil hindered downward movement of water and thus reduced the internal drainage rate. In the study, soils in Shilo area were classified into 3 major categories according as the depth of coarse sand layer {{and the proportion of}} coarse texture soil within the profile. Moreover, soil water movement of each soil category during and after rainfall were simulated by computer software (PORFLOW) for the consultation to improve internal drainage. The result of simulation indicated that soils belong to the first and second categories could be improved by deep tillage as results of creating continuous macropore. The third categories, which had more finer texture proportion in its texture profile and deeper sand layer, mitigation method by improving downward drainage via artificial preferential paths was recommended. The efficiency of various proposed measures to mitigate water logging stress and damages to vegetables, such as deep tillage and artificial <b>drainage</b> <b>column,</b> were field tested at She Kou and Pu Shin, respectively. Both mitigation techniques were able to reduce topsoil water content, enhance downward seepage velocity, by removing more water through macropores of internal soil and leave air passages open. Because the pumped air lost through cracks caused during the process of aeration, the effect of artificial aeration test to increase dissolved oxygen in topsoil was unobvious. 長時間的降雨或瞬間的暴雨都將嚴重影響田間作物的生產，進而造成市場價格的變動。根據農業年報的作物災損資料顯示，近十年台灣地區主要的蔬菜作物產區雲林縣即佔全省蔬菜損害價值的 4. 7 %。依據西螺地區每日蔬菜代採價格與日雨量之統計，結果顯示累積雨量及連續降雨天數均將影響發生蔬菜價格上漲的延遲天數，平均每次降雨發生後約 8 天即可產生最大蔬菜價差。 西螺地區農田係屬於沖積土壤，其土壤剖面質地不均勻易使剖面內部發生排水不良的問題，本研究根據底土可供排水之粗砂質地層出現的深度，以及剖面中質地層理的分佈特性，將研究區內的土壤區分為三大類型，並以電腦模擬軟體(PORFLOW) ，對此三種類型土壤在降雨過程中及降雨停止後的水分動態變化進行模擬。結果顯示第一類及第二類土壤適合利用深層翻土技術，以增加大孔隙連續相並促進土壤內部排水的效果，而第三類土壤因剖面中粗質地土壤含量比例低且粗砂層較深，建議利用人工優勢流動垂直管道，引導水分由剖面中的排水砂層排出。 深層翻土和人工垂直排水管道兩種措施對防護蔬菜淹水逆境之功效，分別於西螺社口段及埔心段農田進行實際改良試驗，並證確實可以迅速減少大雨過後的表土水分含量，且提高水分向下移動的速度，使剖面內部排開較多的空氣孔隙。但是為了增加表土於浸水狀態下的溶氧所進行的人工打氣試驗，因通氣過程中氣體直接經由土壤裂隙逸散，且表土中的氧化還原電位變異極大，所以此試驗效果並不明顯。摘要 緒言 第一章 降雨特性對西螺地區蔬菜生產之影響及因應對策分析 摘要 前言 材料與方法 結果與討論 結論 參考文獻 第二章 蔬菜淹水傷害防護措施之模擬研究 摘要 前言 材料與方法 結果與討論 結論 參考文獻 第三章 蔬菜淹水傷害防護措施之田間研究 摘要 前言 材料與方法 結果與討論 結論 參考文獻 總結 英文摘要 附錄一 土壤剖面資料 附錄二 PORFLOW模式模擬程...|$|E

High compressibility, low permeability and liability to secondary compression of these soils can result in long-term settlements and a menace with critical situations when the construction deadlines are tough.

40|$|Heavy {{metals in}} {{wastewater}} sewage sludge (biosolids), applied to land, contaminate soils. Phytoremediation, {{the use of}} plants to clean up toxic heavy metals, might remove them. Chelating agents are added to soil to solubilize the metals for enhanced phytoextraction. Yet no studies follow the displacement and leaching of heavy metals in soil with and without roots following solubilization with chelates. The objective of this work {{was to determine the}} mobility of heavy metals in biosolids applied to the surface of soil columns (76 cm long; 17 cm diam.) with or without plants (barley; Hordeum vulgare L.). Three weeks after barley was planted, all columns were irrigated with the disodium salt of the chelating agent, EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid) (0. 5 g/kg soil). Drainage water, soil, and plants were analyzed for heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn). Total concentrations of the heavy metals in all columns {{at the end of the}} experiment generally were lower in the top 30 cm of soil with EDTA than without EDTA. The chelate increased concentrations of heavy metals in shoots. With or without plants, the EDTA mobilized Cd, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn, which leached to drainage water. <b>Drainage</b> water from <b>columns</b> without EDTA had concentrations of these heavy metals below detection limits. Only Cu did not leach in the presence of EDTA. Even though roots retarded the movement of Cd, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn through the EDTA-treated soil from 1 d (Cd) to 5 d (Fe), the <b>drainage</b> water from <b>columns</b> with EDTA had concentrations of Cd, Fe, Mn, and Pb that exceeded drinking water standards by 1. 3, 500, 620, and 8. 6 times, respectively. Because the chelate rendered Cd, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn mobile, it is suggested that the theory for leaching of soluble salts, put forward by Nielsen and associates in 1965, could be applied to control movement of the heavy metals for maximum uptake during chelate-assisted phytoremediation.

40|$|The In-Riser Ion Exchange program {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of in-tank systems to decontaminate high level waste (HLW) salt solutions at the Savannah River Site (SRS) and the Hanford Site. Small Column Ion Exchange (SCIX) treatment for cesium removal is a primary in-riser technology for decontamination prior to final waste immobilization in Saltstone. Through this process, radioactive cesium from the salt solution is adsorbed onto the ion exchange media which is packed within a flow-through column. Spherical Resorcinol-Formaldehyde (RF) is being considered as the ion exchange media for the application of this technology at both sites. A packed column loaded with media containing radioactive cesium generates significant heat from radiolytic decay. Under normal operating conditions, process fluid flow through the column can provide adequate heat removal from the columns. However, in the unexpected event of loss of fluid flow or fluid <b>drainage</b> from the <b>column,</b> the design must be adequate to handle the thermal load to avoid unacceptable temperature excursions. Otherwise, hot spots may develop locally which could degrade the performance of the ion-exchange media or the temperature could rise above column safety limits. Data exists which indicates that performance degradation with regard to cesium removal occurs with RF at 65 C. In addition, the waste supernate solution will boil around 130 C. As a result, two temperature limits have been assumed for this analysis. An additional upset scenario was considered involving the loss of the supernate solution due to inadvertent fluid <b>drainage</b> through the <b>column</b> boundary. In this case, the column containing the loaded media could be completely dry. This event is expected to result in high temperatures that could damage the column or cause the RF sorbent material to undergo undesired physical changes. One objective of these calculations is to determine the range of temperatures that should be evaluated during testing with the RF media. Although, the safety temperature limit is based on the salt solution boiling point which does not apply in the air-filled case (because there is no liquid), this same limit (130 C) is used as a measure for the evaluation of this condition as well. The primary objective of the present work is to develop models to simulate the thermal performance of the RF column design when the media is fully loaded with radioactive cesium and the central cooling tube is excluded. Previous analysis led to the consideration of this design simplification for RF, since the baseline column design with center cooling was developed assuming that CST media would be used for cesium removal which has a higher volumetric heat load. Temperature distributions and maximum temperatures across the column during SCIX process operations and upset conditions were conducted with a focus on SCIX implementation at Hanford. However, a feed composition and cesium loading were assumed which were known to be considerably higher than would typically be observed at Hanford. In order to evaluate the impact of this potentially highly conservative assumption, fractionally-reduced loading cases were also considered.

40|$|Models {{have been}} {{developed}} to simulate the thermal characteristics of Crystalline Silicotitanate (CST) ion exchange media fully loaded with radioactive cesium in a column configuration and distributed within a waste storage tank. This work was conducted to support the Small Column Ion Exchange (SCIX) program which is focused on processing dissolved, high-sodium salt waste for the removal of specific radionuclides (including Cs- 137, Sr- 90, and actinides) within a High Level Waste (HLW) storage tank at the Savannah River Site. The SCIX design includes CST columns inserted and supported in the tank top risers for cesium removal. Temperature distributions and maximum temperatures across the column were calculated with a focus on process upset conditions. A two-dimensional computational modeling approach for the in-column ion-exchange domain was taken to include conservative, bounding estimates for key parameters such that the results would provide the maximum centerline temperatures achievable under the design configurations using a feed composition known to promote high cesium loading on CST. One salt processing scenario includes the transport of the loaded (and possibly ground) CST media to the treatment tank floor. Therefore, additional thermal modeling calculations were conducted using a three-dimensional approach to evaluate temperature distributions for the entire in-tank domain including distribution of the spent CST media either as a mound or a flat layer on the tank floor. These calculations included mixtures of CST with HLW sludge or loaded Monosodium Titanate (MST) media used for strontium/actinide sorption. The current full-scale design for the CST column includes one central cooling pipe and four outer cooling tubes. Most calculations assumed that the fluid within the column was stagnant (i. e. no buoyancy-induced flow) for a conservative estimate. A primary objective of these calculations was to estimate temperature distributions across packed CST beds immersed in waste supernate or filled with dry air under various accident scenarios. Accident scenarios evaluated included loss of salt solution flow through the bed (a primary heat transfer mechanism), inadvertent <b>column</b> <b>drainage,</b> and loss of active cooling in the column. The calculation results showed that for a wet CST column with active cooling through one central and four outer tubes and 35 C ambient external air, the peak temperature for the fully-loaded column is about 63 C under the loss of fluid flow accident, which is well below the supernate boiling point. The peak temperature for the naturally-cooled (no active, engineered cooling) wet column is 156 C under fully-loaded conditions, exceeding the 130 C boiling point. Under these conditions, supernate boiling would maintain the column temperature near 130 C until all supernate was vaporized. Without active engineered cooling and assuming a dry column suspended in unventilated air at 35 C, the fully-loaded column is expected to rise to a maximum of about 258 C due to the combined loss-of coolant and <b>column</b> <b>drainage</b> accidents. The modeling results demonstrate that the baseline design using one central and four outer cooling tubes provides a highly efficient cooling mechanism for reducing the maximum column temperature. Results for the in-tank modeling calculations clearly indicate that when realistic heat transfer boundary conditions are imposed on the bottom surface of the tank wall, as much as 450 gallons of ground CST (a volume equivalent to two ion exchange processing cycles) in an ideal hemispherical shape (the most conservative geometry) can be placed in the tank without exceeding the 100 C wall temperature limit. Furthermore, {{in the case of an}} evenly-distributed flat layer, the tank wall reaches the temperature limit after the ground CST material reaches a height of approximately 8 inches...|$|R

The experimental results highlight the ion-specific effect of salt ions on the water structure and hence the behavior of saline liquid films. These results are relevant to a number of chemical engineering processes taking place in saline water, including mineral separation by flotation using air bubbles in saline water...|$|R
40|$|Secondary sewage {{effluent}} containing about 3 X 10 (4) plaque-forming units of polio virus type 1 (LSc) per ml was passed through columns 250 cm in length packed with calcareous sand {{from an area}} in the Salt River bed used for ground-water recharge of secondary {{sewage effluent}}. Viruses were not detected in 1 -ml samples extracted from the columns below the 160 -cm level. However, viruses were detected in 5 of 43 100 -ml samples of the <b>column</b> <b>drainage</b> water. Most of the viruses were adsorbed in the top 5 cm of soil. Virus removal was not affected by the infiltration rate, which varied between 15 and 55 cm/day. Flooding a column continuosly for 27 days with the sewage water virus mixture did not saturate the top few centimeters of soil with viruses and {{did not seem to}} affect virus movement. Flooding with deionized water caused virus desorption from the soil and increased their movement through the columns. Adding CaCl 2 to the deionized water prevented most of the virus desorption. Adding a pulse of deionized water followed by sewage water started a virus front moving through the columns, but the viruses were readsorbed and none was detected in outflow samples. Drying the soil for 1 day between applying the virus and flooding with deionized water greatly reduced desorption, and drying for 5 days prevented desorption. Large reductions (99. 99 % or more) of virus would be expected after passage of secondary sewage effluent through 250 cm of the calcareous sand similar to that used in our laboratory columns unless heavy rains fell within 1 day after the application of sewage stopped. Such virus movement could be minimized by the proper management of flooding and drying cycles...|$|R
40|$|Field {{movement}} of several herbicides, rhodamine WT, chloride, and bromide {{was measured by}} sampling field drainage tiles 1. 2 m deep. Under natural rainfall conditions, alachlor (2 -chloro-N-(2, 6 -diethylphenyl) -N-(methoxymethyl) acetamide) and metribuzin (4 -amino- 6 -(1, 1 -dimethylethyl) - 3 -(methylthio) - 1, 2, 4 -triazin- 5 (4 H) -one) were detected in tile effluent samples 12 to 18 hours after a 30. 7 mm rainstorm. Rainfall occurring 1 to 2 days after chemical application was primarily responsible for the elevated concentrations found. In a second experiment, a rainfall simulator was used to apply 50 to 80 mm of water to 8 plots, 24 hours after chemical application. Field drainage tiles were intensively sampled for 8 hours following the simulated rainstorm. Although tile flow rate and backfill material significantly affected solute breakthrough curves, alachlor, cyanazine (2 - ((4 -chloro- 6 -(ethylamino) - 1, 3, 5 -triazin- 2 -yl) amino) - 2 -methylpropanenitrile), rhodamine WT, chloride, and bromide were detected in tile effluent. The rapid breakthrough of both adsorbed and non-adsorbed solutes indicated that preferential flow is an important mechanism for the {{movement of}} surface-applied chemicals in a structured soil. Solute concentrations peaked within 130 minutes {{after the start of}} a simulated rainfall, but then decreased rapidly as matrix flow increased;Laboratory experiments were conducted to study the effect of a large, continuous macropore on chloride and herbicide movement. Packed soil columns were modified by removing a 6 mm diameter core from the center. The importance of a single macropore for water and solute movement was governed largely by the hydraulic conductivity of the surrounding soil matrix. Although higher initial breakthrough concentrations of chloride was measured in columns with a continuous macropore, total chloride recovered was less. In contrast, herbicides were only detected in <b>drainage</b> from soil <b>columns</b> containing a continuous macropore. In soil columns without a continuous macropore, no herbicides were found above the 0. 4 ppb detection limit...|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic (EM) wave {{methods are}} used in many civil {{engineering}} applications for non-destructive investigations such as locating reinforcing steel and voids in concrete, sinkholes, buried utilities, the groundwater table, seepage through dams and determining the thickness of pavements. All of the applications depend on knowing the velocity of the EM wave through the material of interest. The velocity of EM waves through a vacuum {{is equivalent to the}} speed of light; however, as a material's ability to hold a charge increases (ability to be a capacitor), the velocity of the EM wave is slowed through that material. The relative permittivity (dielectric constant) of a material is a measure of a material's ability to hold a charge. Knowing the relative permittivity enables one to calculate the velocity of an EM wave through the material. The goal of a larger research program is to predict the relative permittivity of soils. A principal factor determining the relative permittivity of soil is the water content of the soil. In order to predict accurate relative permittivity for a soil, the water content of the soil must be known. The objective of the research project reported in this thesis was to choose a method to predict the water content of a soil and to quantify the accuracy of the method. The focus of the larger project is on the earth's near subsurface, 0 to about 1 m below ground surface. This depth is often characterized by alternately wet (saturated) to dry pores within the soil and {{is referred to as the}} vadose zone. Knowing the soil water condition at any time is paramount to being able to predict the relative permittivity and subsequently the velocity of EM waves through the soil. A computer code was selected to be used to predict the soil water along a vertical profile in the vadose zone. WinUNSAT-H, a Windows(R) -based version of the code UNSAT-H was used to model the subsurface and predict vertical soil water profiles as a function of time. Inputs into WinUNSAT-H include soil properties and atmospheric conditions. The code was used to predict soil water profiles for a column of sand which was constructed in the laboratory where physical experiments were performed to alternately saturate and then drain the water from the sand column and measure the actual soil water profile. The results of the predicted soil water were then compared to the measured water profile for the sand column. The code was used to predict the soil water profile during draining (drying or dewatering) of the sand column. The sand had a saturated hydraulic conductivity of 0. 04 cm/second which is a high hydraulic conductivity and leads to rapid drainage of water from the column of sand. The saturated volumetric water content of the sand was 0. 35 (all pores in the sand are filled with water) and the residual volumetric water content was 0. 05 (volumetric water content at which no further water will drain from the sand under gravity, i. e., a pressure must be applied to the sand to force any more water from the sand). After the sand was saturated with water, the water source was removed and the water in the pores of the sand was allowed to drain. The 160 cm column of sand drained to nearly the residual volumetric water content within 15 to 30 minutes. After two hours of <b>drainage,</b> the <b>column</b> of sand was essentially at the residual volumetric water content throughout the entire column...|$|R
