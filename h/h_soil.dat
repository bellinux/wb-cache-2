The N mineralization rate was determined during 14 -weeks incubations and assessments were made of the microbial biomass C, dehydrogenase activity and the microbial community structure (PLFA-extraction). The addition of PL biochars increased the net N mineralization (i. e. compared to the control treatment) in both soils while for treatments with P biochars net N immobilization was observed in both soils. Increasing the pyrolysis temperature of both feedstock types led to a decrease in net N mineralization. The ratio of Bacterial to Fungal PLFA biomarkers also increased with addition of biochars, {{and particularly in the}} case of the 500 °C biochars. Next to feedstock type and pyrolysis temperature, SOM content clearly affected the assessed soil biological parameters, viz. net N mineralization or immobilization, MBC and dehydrogenase activity were all greater in the <b>H</b> <b>soil.</b> This might be explained by an increased chance of physical contact between the microbial community activated by SOM mineralization upon incubation and discrete biochar particles.

Soil temperature, moisture and soil strength were measured congruently to study their effect on the soil CO 2 flux magnitude. Immediately after fall tillage, the CT showed the highest CO 2 flux (4. 9 g m- 2 h- 1); RT exhibited an intermediate value (2. 1 g m- 2 h- 1) whereas the lowest flux (0. 7 g m- 2 h- 1) was reported under NT. After spring tillage, similar but smaller impacts of the tillage practices on soil CO 2 flux were reported with fluxes ranging from 1. 8 g CO 2 m- 2 h- 1 (CT) to less than 0. 1 g CO 2 m- 2 h- 1 (NT). Soil strength was significantly correlated with soil CO 2 emission; whereas surface soil temperature and moisture were low correlated to the soil CO 2 flux. The intensity of rainfall events before fall and spring tillage practices could explain the seasonal CO 2 flux trends. The findings promote conservation tillage and more specifically no tillage practices to reduce CO 2 losses within these Mediterranean agroecosystems. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

We amended soil samples with 12 C-labelled compounds [benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) as positive control, cypermethrin, diazinon or isoproturon) at levels in line with real-world typical environmental levels. These were placed in glass jars, whereupon A. longa were exposed for 24 <b>h.</b> <b>Soil</b> samples amended with cypermethrin were variously aged up to 100 days. Post-exposure, coelomic fluid containing coelomyocytes were harvested and incorporated into the alkaline single cell-gel electrophoresis (‘comet’) assay.

In contrast to P, pre-incubation with glucose did not alter EOC concentration or the pulse in EOC after rewetting.

40|$|This study {{demonstrated}} a new method for mapping high-resolution (spatial: 1 m, and temporal: 1 <b>h)</b> <b>soil</b> moisture by assimilating distributed temperature sensing (DTS) observed soil temperatures at intermediate scales. In {{order to provide}} robust soil moisture and property estimates, we first proposed an adaptive particle batch smoother algorithm (APBS). In the APBS, a tuning factor, which can avoid severe particle weight degeneration, is automatically determined by maximizing {{the reliability of the}} soil temperature estimates of each batch window. A multiple truth synthetic test was used to demonstrate the APBS can robustly estimate soil moisture and properties using observed soil temperatures at two shallow depths. The APBS algorithm was then applied to DTS data along a 71 m transect, yielding an hourly soil moisture map with meter resolution. Results show the APBS can draw the prior guessed soil hydraulic and thermal properties significantly closer to the field measured reference values. The improved soil properties in turn remove the soil moisture biases between the prior guessed and reference soil moisture, which was particularly noticeable at depth above 20 cm. This high-resolution soil moisture map demonstrates the potential of characterizing soil moisture temporal and spatial variability and reflects patterns consistent with previous studies conducted using intensive point scale soil moisture samples. The intermediate scale high spatial resolution soil moisture information derived from the DTS may facilitate remote sensing soil moisture product calibration and validation. In addition, the APBS algorithm proposed in this study would also be applicable to general hydrological data assimilation problems for robust model state and parameter estimation. </p...|$|E

Based on the theory of nonisothermal water-heat coupled transfer, a simulation model, programmed in Visual Basic 6. 0, was developed to predict the coupled transfer of water and heat in hilly red soil. A series of soil column experiments for soil water and heat transfer, including soil columns with closed and evaporating top ends, were {{used to test the}} simulation model. Results showed that in the closed columns, the temporal and spatial distribution of moisture and heat could be very well predicted by the model, while in the evaporating columns, the simulated soil water contents were somewhat different from the observed ones. In the heat flow equation by Taylor and Lary (1964), the effect of soil water evaporation on the heat flow is not involved, which may be the main reason for the differences between simulated and observed results.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Despite {{concerns}} {{about the impact of}} rising sea levels and storm surge events on coastal ecosystems, there is remarkably little information on the response of terrestrial coastal plant species to seawater inundation. The aim {{of this study was to}} elucidate responses of a glycophyte (white clover, Trifolium repens) to short-duration soil flooding by seawater and recovery following leaching of salts. METHODS: Using plants cultivated from parent ecotypes collected from a natural soil salinity gradient, the impact of short-duration seawater soil flooding (8 or 24 h) on short-term changes in leaf salt ion and organic solute concentrations was examined, together with longer term impacts on plant growth (stolon elongation) and flowering. KEY RESULTS: There was substantial Cl(-) and Na(+) accumulation in leaves, especially for plants subjected to 24 <b>h</b> <b>soil</b> flooding with seawater, but no consistent variation linked to parent plant provenance. Proline and sucrose concentrations also increased in plants following seawater flooding of the soil. Plant growth and flowering were reduced by longer soil immersion times (seawater flooding followed by drainage and freshwater inputs), but plants originating from more saline soil responded less negatively than those from lower salinity soil. CONCLUSIONS: The accumulation of proline and sucrose indicates a potential for solute accumulation as a response to the osmotic imbalance caused by salt ions, while variation in growth and flowering responses between ecotypes points to a natural adaptive capacity for tolerance of short-duration seawater soil flooding in T. repens. Consequently, it is suggested that selection for tolerant ecotypes is possible should the predicted increase in frequency of storm surge flooding events occur...|$|E
40|$|Various {{methods have}} been {{suggested}} to separate root and microbial contributions to soil respiration. However, to date there is no ideal approach available to partition below-ground CO 2 fluxes in its components although the combination of traditional methods with approaches based on isotopes seems especially promising for the future improvement of estimates. Here we provide evidence for the applicability of a new approach based on the hypothesis that root-derived (rhizomicrobial) respiration, including root respiration and CO 2 derived from microbial activity {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the root, is proportional to non-structural carbon contents (sugars and organic acids) of plant tissues. We examined relationships between root-derived CO 2 and non-structural carbon of rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings using C- 14 pulse labelling techniques, which partitioned the C- 14 fixed by photosynthesis into root-derived (CO 2) -C- 14, and C- 14 in sugars and organic acids of roots and shoots. After the C- 14 pulse C- 14 in both sugars and organic acids of plant tissues decreased steeply during the first 12 h, and then decreased at a lower rate during the remaining 60 <b>h.</b> <b>Soil</b> (CO 2) -C- 14 efflux and Soil CO 2 efflux strongly depended on C- 14 pools in non-structural carbon of the plant tissues. Based on the linear regression between root-derived respiration and total non-structural carbon (sugars and organic acids) of roots, non-rhizomicrobial respiration (SOM-derived) was estimated to be 0. 25 mg C g(- 1) root d. w. h(- 1). Assuming the value was constant, root-derived respiration contributed 85 - 92 % to bulk soil respiration. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|E

For this study, a helicopter-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was equipped with multispectral and infrared thermal cameras to obtain simultaneously the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface temperature (Tsurface) at very high resolution (6 cm × 6 cm). Meteorological variables and surface energy balance components were measured {{at the time of}} the UAV overpass (near solar noon). The performance of the RSEB algorithm was evaluated using measurements of H and LE obtained from an eddy correlation system.
