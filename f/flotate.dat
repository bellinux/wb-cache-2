40|$|To better {{understand}} the hot water-mediated organic transformation process (aquathermolysis) that occurs during the steam-assisted recovery of heavy oils and bitumen we have performed a series of experiments that subject a heavy oil to progressively higher temperatures and pressures {{in the presence of}} liquid water. As temperature and pressure increases, from ambient conditions to 300 °C and 1250 psig (8. 6 MPa), a floating oil (<b>flotate)</b> is generated and is composed of mostly aliphatic hydrocarbons that appear to be generated at the expense of polars and asphaltenes. Analyses of hopane maturity parameters for the <b>flotate</b> indicate lower temperatures than the starting material suggesting the liberation of hopanes and, therefore, other hydrocarbons, from asphaltenes. Infrared spectra confirm changes in overall organic constitution as the relative abundance of hydrocarbons to oxygen-containing functional groups increases in the <b>flotate.</b> At the highest temperatures and pressures (325 °C, 1750 psig (13. 8 MPa)) the <b>flotate</b> is at a maximum relative amount, the untransformed heavy oil is at a minimum and significant amounts of methane are generated indicating the onset of cracking. Steam-assisted recovery of heavy oil, therefore, leads to changes in the chemical constitution of a number of chemical fractions generating a lighter oil and gases that {{must be taken into account}} when planning field operations for production...|$|E

VLDL, 1 DL and LDL were <b>flotated</b> at densities of 1. 006, 1. 019 and 1. 063 kg/l in runs lasting 30, 100 and 100 minutes. Chylomicrons, if present, were <b>flotated</b> in a separate run. HDL were isolated by precipitation of the apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins from total plasma using polyethylene glycol. Three series of separations were routinely performed: 1. VLDL run alone (632 samples), 2. VLDL run H- LDL run (122 samples), and 3. Chylomicron Separation H- VLDL run + IDL run (92 samples). The concentrations of cholesterol and triacylglycerol were obtained for plasma, chylomicrons, VLDL, IDL, LDL and HDL.

These changes of the pollen flora reflect the change from an open, but not treeless vegetation of late Würmian age (= last glacial period) to a postglacial forest vegetation (intermediate and final phases). This dating is essentially the same as the one given by van Straaten (1966) when studying the mollusc fauna of the same cores. A comparison of the marine pollen spectra with same-age continental ones allows to estimate the effect of the different ability of each pollen type to <b>flotate</b> in salt water, of reworking of pollen by erosion, turbidity currents and benthonic animals, and of the samples preparation method (flotation with ZnCl 2 -solution) on the pollen content of marine samples. Mesozoic sporomorphs and earlypleistocene pollen has been found only occasionally. Larger quantities of probably reworked pollen were stated in samples from glacial age pollen zones and turbidites only. Pollen frequency was greater in turbidites than in normal sediment. Turbidites also contain more pollen of thermophilous taxa. Pinus is apparently overrepresented in all samples, and flotation with ZnCl 2 -solution may cause an underrepresentation of certain pollen types (e. g. of Juniperus and Gramineae).

It was necessary to replace the pre-concentration done by manual selection (handpicking) and jigging, with a more efficient method and with greater capacity to deal with the greater volume of ore plus waste that reached the plant. In 1971 a Heavy Medium separation (HMS) was installed which carries out pre-concentration in a very effective way and with minimal losses. Due to improvement in the mine stopping method and greater need for fragmentation for the medium separation, a fines recovery circuit was installed in the 60’s which was improved and expanded in the 80s.

40|$|Lanthanides, {{also called}} rare earth {{elements}} (REE) are key elements in modern technologies and especially in green technologies such as energy generation through wind power. Thus, they are of considerable economic importance with a global production of around 124 000 t REE per year. A detailed environmental assessment with identification of all risks is the foundation to assess the sustainability of mining, processing and separation processes. Rare earth elements usually are found together with actinides such as uranium and thorium. Therefore, actinides and their decay products are simultaneously enriched during the processing of REE. In addition to conventional REE minerals such as monazite or bastnasite, the mineral eudialyte {{can be used as}} a REE source. Even though, the total share of REE is low, the most important REE needed for industrial usages are strongly represented in eudialyte. Furthermore, the proportion of radioactive impurities is very low. Eudialyte is currently not used as source mineral, but might play a bigger role on the global market in the future. Little information about the environmental impacts of REE-production is available to the public, in particular with regard to its radioactive by-products. Thorium is the most prominent of these and has therefore been characterized in detail for its ecotoxicity. A first goal of this work was to evaluate the α- emitter thorium and its impact on the environment. To this aim, an intensive literature search was conducted and results were prepared including the long-term effects of thorium dust and gaseous emissions. Therefore and because ecotoxicological testing of gaseous emissions was technically difficult and environmentally less relevant – unlike its immense impact for exposed industrial workers and bystanders – the water effluent und solid waste streams were investigated with aquatic and terrestrial toxicological experiments. The knowledge gained is meant to supplement the missing data for thorium. A throughout analysis of thorium fluxes along the process of SEE recovery was carried out, and the effects of disposals and other products involved were measured based on ecotoxicological tests with aquatic and terrestrial organisms. In experiments with thorium exclusively the heavy metal property was regarded since radiation effects with a radioactivity half-life of approximately 14 billion years play a subordinate role in typical ecotoxicological testing periods. Moreover, it should be noted that thorium occurs in nature alongside its decay products. Th(OH) 4 at pH 6. 5 to 8 showed no toxic effects in all organisms studied, aquatic (bacteria, algae and daphnia) and terrestrial (springtails, earthworms). Thorium thus does not appear to be a problem in the range of water solubility and in soil concentrations typical found. The effects of process wastewater from various process steps in the production of REE were evaluated based on eudialyte, which was investigated as an example for REE minerals. Figure 1 shows the investigated process steps of eudialyte: after mining, drill, blast and load haul operation, the ore is milled and grinded. In order to enrich it, the wanted mineral is <b>flotated.</b> Afterwards chemicals (acids) are added to dissolve the minerals. Impurities are removed by pH adjustment and precipitation which is also used for REE separation later. Stronger REE separation is achieved by solvent extraction and finally pure REE are obtained by electrolysis. Ground and <b>flotated</b> eudialyte had no or very little ecotoxicological effects. By contrast, leaching residues showed that concentrations which arise during production have a negative impact on all tested organisms (see figure 1). Due to mixture toxicity, it is difficult to estimate which compound is responsible for the total toxicity. It is known that the toxicity of metals differs in various organisms. A general trend shows the following toxicity sequence: Hg> Ag> Cu> Cd> Zn> Ni> Pb> Cr> Sn (Luoma & Rainbow 2011; Merian et al. 2004; F. Scheffer & Schachtschabel 2010). In soil the pH value (soil acidity) has the greatest impact on the metal availability. If the pH value increases, the mobility of heavy metals decreases and thus their availability is reduced. The current study showed that residues from rare earth mining should be stored in a way that ensures that wash-out processes do not affect the water or soil systems. Even tailing dams should be avoided, since otherwise leaching residues can still be washed out, and, on the other hand, terrestrial organisms may be adversely affected. In conclusion, the dumping of leaching residues should be monitored so that they will not pass freely to stockpiles. Additionally, it is important to avoid fine dust which is produced by grinding processes and must not drift. This can be achieved by continuous humidification of stockpiles...|$|R
40|$|Iron ore pellets are an {{important}} refined product used as a raw material {{in the production of}} steel. In order to meet the requirements of the processes for iron production, the iron ore is upgraded in a number of steps including, among others, reverse flotation. Under certain circumstances the flotation collector may inadvertently adsorb on the iron ore particles increasing the hydrophobicity of the iron ore concentrate, which in turn has been shown to have an adverse effect on pellet strength. To minimize the influence of the collector on pellet properties, {{it is important to understand}} the mechanism of collector adsorption on iron oxides and how different factors may affect the extent of adsorption. In Papers I-III, the adsorption of a commercial anionic carboxylate collector Atrac 1563 and a number of model compounds on synthetic iron oxides was studied in-situ using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transforms infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. The effect of surfactant concentration, pH, ionic strength, calcium ions and sodium silicate on surfactant adsorption was investigated. The adsorption mechanism of anionic surfactants on iron oxides at pH 8. 5 in the absence and presence of other ions was elucidated. Whereas silicate species were shown to reduce surfactant adsorption, calcium ions were found to facilitate the adsorption and precipitation of the surfactant on magnetite even in the presence of sodium silicate. This implies that a high concentration of calcium in the process water could possibly enhance the contamination of the iron ore with the flotation collector. In Paper III, the effect of calcium, silicate and a carboxylate surfactant on the zeta-potential and wetting properties of magnetite was investigated. It was concluded that a high content of calcium ions in the process water could reduce the dispersing effect of silicate in flotation of apatite from magnetite. Whereas treatment with calcium chloride and sodium silicate made magnetite more hydrophilic, subsequent adsorption of the anionic surfactant increased the water contact angle of magnetite. The hydrophobic areas on the magnetite surface could result in incorporation of air bubbles inside the iron ore pellets produced by wet agglomeration, lowering pellet strength. Based on the adsorption studies, it was concluded that calcium ions could be detrimental for both flotation and agglomeration. Since water softening could result in further dissolution of calcium-containing minerals, an alternative method of handling surfactant coatings on magnetite surfaces was proposed in Paper IV. It was shown that the wettability of the magnetite surface after surfactant adsorption could be restored by modifying the surface with polyacrylate or sodium silicate. In Paper V, the results obtained using synthetic magnetite were verified for natural magnetite. It was illustrated that the conclusions made for the model system regarding the detrimental effect of calcium ions were applicable to the natural magnetite particles and commercial flotation reagents. It was confirmed that polyacrylate and soluble silicate could be successfully used to improve the wettability of the <b>flotated</b> magnetite concentrate. The fact that polyacrylate improved the wettability of magnetite more efficiently at the increased concentration of calcium ions indicates that this polymer is a good candidate for applications in hard water. Finally, it was concluded that in-situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy in combination with zeta-potential and contact angle measurements could be successfully applied for studying surface phenomena related to mineral processing.

40|$|Activated sludge {{with poor}} {{settling}} characteristics is caught under the term "bulking" sludge. Various types of bulking activated sludge can be distinguished. 1) Sludge containing {{an abundance of}} filamentous microorganisms. 2) Sludge, characterized by excessive amount of bacterial slime. 3) <b>Flotating</b> sludge caused by denitrification. The excessive growth of filamentous bacteria, sometimes occurring in activated sludge plants, is difficult to understand. One of the hypotheses is that the filamentous bacteria protruding from floes have a better competitive ability as compared with unicellular microorganisms which occur mostly in floes, in which the growth conditions are assumed to affect adversely {{the development of these}} bacteria. As activated sludge floes are difficultly to dispers without damaging the cells, it was decided to study the effect of the aggregative condition on the bacterial activity by using floc-forming strains of which the floes were easily dispersable by adding the enzyme cellulase. Most experiments were carried out with Zoogloea ramigera, strain I- 16 -M, and an Alcaligenes sp., strain 15. As floc formation {{turned out to be a}} rather unreproducible and unpredictable phenomenon, it was often difficult to obtain sufficient amounts of floes. For this reason it was necessary to study floc formation by some pure cultures. In chapter I it was shown that floc formation of Zoogloea ramigera can be strongly stimulated by adding small amounts of NaCl or Na 2 HPO 4 /NaH 2 PO 4 to suspended cells. Unless the cells were very old, the growth phase of the culture was unimportant in respect to flee formation. The stimulatory effect of the salts could not satisfactorily be explained. By studying the activities of cells in floes and in suspension, it was shown (chapter II) that the oxygen uptake rate of cells in floes and of cells in suspension, in the presence of a high level of substrate, represents a zero order reaction above oxygen concentrations in the medium of approx. 1. 5 ppm. and approx. 0. 1 ppm., respectively. In activated sludge, where only part of the floes consists of living bacteria, the rate-limiting oxygen concentration is approx. 0. 5 ppm. Glucose respiration becomes rate-limiting when the glucose concentration is below approx. 20 ppm. with cells in floes and below approx. 8 ppm. with cells in suspension. In the same chapter it was shown that the protein and poly-β-hydroxybutyrate syntheses of cells in floes of slowly shaken cultures were strongly retarded as compared with these activities in cells occurring in suspension. The rate-limiting concentrations of oxygen and substrate (glucose) for the uptake of these compounds by cells in flocs are in the same range as the values found in many reactors of activated sludge plants. To compare the competitive ability of Haliscomenobacter hydrossis, a filamentous bacterium, with that of the unicellular Zoogloea ramigera, continuous culture experiments were carried out. Zoogloea ramigera was the most abundant organism present in the mixed cultures at all tested dilution rates (using a complex medium). The filamentous microorganism was shown to have a low affinity towards the uptake of glucose. Both, amino acids and glucose were used as energy and C sources by this organism (chapter III). Floc flotation, caused by N 2 gas bubbles resulting from the dissimilatory reduction of nitrate, is another aspect of the phenomenon of bulking sludge. Denitrification occurs only under anaerobic conditions. These conditions were shown to occur within flocs at relatively low oxygen concentrations of the surrounding medium. In chapter IV dissimilatory nitrate reduction in the flocs of the Alcaligenes sp. strain 15, was shown to take place as soon as the supply of oxygen within parts of the flocs was inadequate. By studying the denitrifying ability of this strain, the dissimilatory nitrate reduction turned out to be even independent of the presence of oxygen when the cells had been subjected to a special treatment. Upon aerobic precultivation of strain 15 with NH 4 +-N or NO 3 --N as nitrogen source, aerobic nitrate respiration of the washed cells was measured after nitrate addition as soon as the oxygen uptake was inhibited. This inhibition was caused by NO, the reductionproduct of nitrite (chapter V). The same aerobic dissimilatory nitrate reduction was observed with anaerobically precultivated cells which afterwards had been aerated for some hours in a nitrogen-free medium. It was shown that in these cells duringthe aeration period the NO reductase and N 2 O reductase were inactivated/broken down giving rise to the accumulation of NO and N 2 O during subsequent anaerobic nitrate respiration. When the cells were re-aerated, even very small amounts of the produced NO were sufficient to inhibit the oxygen uptake, resulting in a continued aerobic nitrate respiration. This type of aerobic dissimilatory nitrate reduction as found with strain 15 was also found with a number of different denitrifying strains, isolated from activated sludge. The oxygen uptake of activated sludge itself could not be inhibited for a long time upon addition of NO as the presence of many NO-reducing bacteria (denitrifying bacteria) readily removed the inhibiting agent (chapter V). In the aeration tank of an activated sludge plant, the oxygen concentration sometimes drops temporarily to such a level that the interior parts of the flocs become anaerobic. Denitrification in these anaerobic innerparts starts only when the denitrifying bacteria present possess the enzymes for the reduction reactions. In chapter VI it was proved that a number of denitrifying bacteria have the ability to synthesize the dissimilatory nitrate reductase in the presence of oxygen and ammonium ions so that these bacteria are able to start dissimilatory nitrate reduction as soon as all the oxygen has been consumed. A more detailed study of the "constitutive" character of the synthesis of the dissimilatory nitrate reductase in strain 15 and another denitrifying strain, N 4, showed that the synthesis of the enzyme by strain 15 was strongly repressed when the growth medium was over-satisfied with oxygen or upon the addition of chlorate. The synthesis of the dissimilatory nitrate reductase in strain N 4 was hardly affected by the mentioned repressing agents. The repressing effect of chlorate on the synthesis of the dissimilatory nitrate reductase in cells of strain 15 was explained by the redox potential-increasing effect of this agent assuming that the redox potential is the regulating factor in the synthesis of this enzyme, rather than oxygen...|$|R
40|$|Distillates from {{crude oil}} such as diesel and fuel oil may contain {{significant}} amounts of dibenzothiophenes and their alkylated derivatives, containing organically bound sulfur. Combustion of those fossil fuels leads {{to the release of}} polluting sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, where it causes 'acid rain'. Due to stricter environmental legislation and depletion of crude oil reserves with low organic sulfur contents, effective desulfurization processes are becoming increasingly important. For instance: beginning in 2005 the maximal allowable sulfur content in gas oil in the European Community will be 0. 005 wt. %. Currently, the refining industry applies the energy intensive physico-chemical hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process {{in order to reduce the}} sulfur content. Due to the high costs and inherent chemical limitations associated with HDS, biodesulfurization of hydrocarbon streams might represent an attractive complementary method to obtain sufficiently low sulfur levels. Bacteria require relatively mild process conditions (pressure and temperature) and bacterial enzymes are very selective in converting target molecules. The objective of this thesis was to develop an anaerobic biodesulfurization process. The thesis is build up around the reductive desulfurization reaction presented below. Dibenzothiophene (DBT) is converted under anaerobic conditions to biphenyl and sulfide with the concomitant conversion of reduction equivalents. The caloric value of the fuel molecule is retained and the sulfur is removed specifically. Chapter 1 presents a general introduction on physico-chemical and microbiological methods to desulfurize organic sulfur compounds. In Chapter 2 the DBT mass transfer rate within hydrocarbon droplets is compared to aerobic DBT conversion rates. The apolar DBT must diffuse to the hydrocarbon/water interface where bacteria prevail. The calculated values for the DBT mass transfer rate were compared to those found for aerobic DBT conversion rates, as reported in the literature. Temperature dependent data (ranging from 20 up to 60 °C) of viscosity, density, and interfacial tension of various hydrocarbon distillates were incorporated in the model. The model simulated the DBT diffusion in hydrocarbon droplets as obtained in a stirred tank reactor. Based on these calculations, we estimated that the mass transfer rate of DBT within the hydrocarbon droplet to the hydrocarbon/water interface is at least a factor 10 to 10 4 higher than the specific DBT conversion rates. However, the presence of a high specific surface area is essential to enhance the surface contact between bacteria and the hydrocarbon phase. The availability of a suitable biomass is crucial to develop this new bioprocess. In Chapter 3 a screening method is described to enrich biomass from mixed bacterial populations obtained from oil-polluted environments. The enriched cultures were able to grow in the presence of thiophenes as the sole electron acceptor. A proof of principle was obtained; the formation of sulfide and biphenyl from dibenzothiophene was shown conclusively. Also thiophene and benzothiophene depletion with concomitant sulfide formation was observed. However, apart from sulfide no thiophene nor benzothiophene desulfurization products could be demonstrated. The main problem during consecutive enrichments was the loss of biological activity after transferring the desulfurizing biomass. A mixed population was present and the active desulfurizing biomass was easily overgrown by acetogenic bacteria. Therefore, it was attempted to isolate the desulfurizing bacteria. The isolation procedure resulted in the availability of highly enriched cultures able to desulfurize thiophenes when cultivated using a selective medium with H 2 as electron donor and limiting amounts of bicarbonate and acetate (1 mM each). Based on process considerations H 2 gas is the most suitable electron donor for the reductive desulfurization process. In Chapters 4 and 5 attention is paid to the mass transfer rate of H 2 in a gas/water/hydrocarbon three-phase system using n -dodecane as model solvent. Because vigorous foam formation occurs when H 2 gas is directly added to a n -dodecane in water dispersion, it was proposed to saturate the n -dodecane with H 2 gas prior to disperse it into the water phase. Experiments to determine the H 2 mass transfer coefficients involved using physical methods are described in Chapter 4. The H 2 mass transfer coefficients between the gas and the n -dodecane phase (k d) and between the gas and the water phase (k w) were determined using a dynamic method by following the pressure decline in time, whilst the overall H 2 mass transfer coefficient between n -dodecane and water (k dw) was determined using a steady state method. The value for k dw was assessed using tritium-hydride (T-H instead of H-H) as the tracer. The effects of the temperature (30, 40 and 50 oC) and salt concentrations (0 - 250 mM) were studied. The value for k w [(9. 7 ± 0. 2) x 10 - 5 ms - 1 at 30 ºC] was found to be a factor 3. 3 higher than for k d [(2. 89 ± 0. 12) x 10 - 5 ms - 1 at 30 ºC] because of the lower viscosity of water. No effect was found for the presence of salts (up to 250 mM NaCl) on the k w -value. The k dw -value determined in the steady state experiments at 30 ºC was (5 ± 0. 6) x 10 - 6 ms - 1 which is 19. 4 times smaller than the above-mentioned k w -value. The considerable smaller value for k dw must be attributed to the additional mass transfer resistance introduced by the second liquid phase. Calculations of the maximal attainable H 2 flux revealed values of 0. 016 x 10 - 3 mol/m 2 s and 3. 9 x 10 - 3 mol/m 2 s for a n -dodecane/water and gas/water system, respectively. Therefore, the specific surface area between n -dodecane and water is the determining parameter for sufficient H 2 mass transfer. In Chapter 5, the H 2 mass transfer is described further using a bioreactor equipped with a nozzle to create very fine n -dodecane droplets. The specific surface area is dependent on the maximum attainable hold-up of n -dodecane and the diameter of the droplets. These parameters were studied in a model system consisting of n -dodecane and water supplemented with NaCl. The use of the nozzle resulted in droplets with a Sauter mean diameter of only 10. 3 ± 0. 9 mm. The droplet size was found to be independent of the applied pressure drop over the nozzle. The hold-up of n -dodecane in the aqueous medium is clearly dependent on the sodium ion concentration. The hold-up decreases rapidly (from 0. 14 to 0. 04) with increasing sodium ion concentrations due to coagulation; from 94 mM onwards the hold-up becomes 0. 04. The application of n -dodecane droplets as carrier phase for H 2 mass transfer was demonstrated in batch tests for biological sulfate reduction. During operation of the bioreactor, biomass attached to the rising n -dodecane droplets and eventually <b>flotated</b> from the system. In addition biological steady state experiments were performed with hydrogenotrophic sulfate reducing bacteria to determine the H 2 mass transfer coefficient for a n -dodecane/water system (k dw). A value of (4. 0 ± 0. 24) x 10 - 6 ms - 1 was found, which is close to the values found in the experiments using tritium hydride. Final calculations showed that the volumetric H 2 mass transfer rate (mol/m 3 s) from n -dodecane to water can be comparable to values found for gas lift reactors, thus the high specific surface area that can be created by applying a nozzle can overcome the lower value of the H 2 flux (mol/m 2 s) to a large extent. Chapter 6 addresses the role of sulfide on anaerobic biodesulfurization. The presence of increased sulfide concentrations is undesirable because it is expected that sulfide will inhibit the DBT conversion. Therefore, insight in the partitioning of gaseous hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) over a three-phase gas/water/hydrocarbon system is required. The partitioning of H 2 S over a gas/water/ n -dodecane system is described. Experimental results matched well with the model predictions. The effect of the presence of an extra hydrocarbon phase (n -dodecane) notably decreased the total sulfide in the water phase and the H 2 S fraction in the gas phase. The hydrocarbon phase serves as a sink for H 2 S molecules and by scrubbing the H 2 S in a separate process step (e. g. during H 2 saturation) the sulfide concentration can be lowered to favor the anaerobic biodesulfurization...|$|R

U iskopavanjima 2002. godine otkriven je paljevinski grob s drvenom arhitekturom u kojem su se nalazili prilozi dvojakoga podrijetla. Autohtono podrijetlo u latenskoj kulturi mlađega željeznoga doba pokazuju lonci zaobljenoga tijela izrađeni rukom i zdjela S-profilacije. Sjevernoitalskoga podrijetla su zdjelica tankih stijenki, keramička svjetiljka, staklena posuda te ostali prilozi koji zajedno s Klaudijevim novcem datiraju grob u sredinu 1. st. Na osnovi nalaza posuda izrađenih u latenskim tradicijama pretpostavlja se kako je u grobu bila pokopana osoba starosjedilačkoga podrijetla, dok importirani prilozi svjedoče o ranoj romanizaciji južne Panonije i dunavskoga limesa. O postojanju složenoga pogrebnoga rituala svjedoče izdvojeni ostaci kultiviranih biljaka domaćega i uvoznoga podrijetla koje su bile položene u lonce. The high Danube bank near Ilok, {{which is}} {{situated}} on the western slopes of Fruška gora, was continuously settled in all prehistoric periods, and after that - as the finds analyzed herein indicate - in the Roman time, but Ilok experienced its peak in the Late Middle Ages, {{in the period of}} Nikola and his son Lovro. The beginning of excavations in Ilok’s upper town is particularly significant for reveal of the topography of Roman Ilok, which remained almost completely unknown due to a small number of finds. Data about the Roman settlement of Ilok (Cuccium) are preserved in several Itineraries, with different forms for the settlement’s name. Thus Notitia Dignitatum mentions two cavalry units, Cuneus equitum Promotorum and Equites Sagittarii, in Cuccium of the 4 th century. The excavations of the Institute of Archaeology in Zagreb began in 2001 in the extension of the eastern wing of Odescalchi Castle, to be continued in 2002 towards the west to encompass the lawn in front of the castle (Fig. 1). In preloess layer SJ 224 (10 YR 4 / 3) {{in the southern part of}} the excavated area, filling SJ 229 was isolated. This filling is the first in a number of preserved fillings of the larger prehistoric pit SJ 306 which by finds was dated to the beginning of the Early Iron Age. In prehistoric filling SJ 229 another younger rectangular filling SJ 230 (5 Y 4 / 3) was identified, whose western edge was damaged by recent burial in lime pit SJ 216, whereas the southern part lies outside the margin of the excavated area. Filling SJ 230 is part of the Early Roman grave SJ 273. Along the southern profile of the dig in filling SJ 230 a smaller burial SJ 270 and filling SJ 269, which caused no major damage to the grave (Fig. 5), were identified. The bottom of the grave with finds remained preserved, and the lack of incinerated human remains is possibly due to the fact that they are situated in the southern part of the grave, which has not yet been excavated, even though it is highly possible that they were destroyed in an earlier intervention in the grave filling. All grave goods were found in the eastern part of the grave (Fig. 2, Fig. 4). In the middle of the grave, close to the top of SJ 230, a hollow shafted iron axe (Pl. 2, 7) was found, which on account of its position compared to other finds is supposed to have entered the grave by digging through the older prehistoric strata, thus not belonging to the grave goods. On the bottom of the grave, filling SJ 268 (2. 5 Y 5 / 6) was isolated which belongs to the thin layer of preserved wooden architecture (Fig. 2 - 3), on whose remains in the northeastern corner of the grave two hand-made pots with a rounded body and a flat rim and bottom (Pl. 1, 1 - 2) were found, as well as fragments of a wheel-made bowl with an S profile (Pl. 2, 1). In the corner of the grave, fragments of a dark-gray bowl with thin walls (Pl. 2, 6) and a play-token of dark blue glass paste (Pl. 2, 1) were found. A part of the bowl was also in a pot laid slightly more to the south (Pl. 1, 2). Around both pots numerous seeds were identified, which is why the complete content of the filling around the vessels and their filling is <b>flotated.</b> In the eastern part of the grave there were fragments of a glass vessel, probably a funnel or a glass (Pl. 2, 4). Fragments of a ceramic lamp (Pl. 2, 5), a bronze earring (Pl. 1, 3), a fragment of a bronze needle (Pl. 1, 5) and an iron rivet (Pl. 2, 8) were found in the southeastern excavated part of the grave. Also in that part of the grave a bronze artifact, which probably represents a vessel’s handle fastening system (Pl. 1, 4), and Claudius coin (Pl. 1, 6) were found. Beneath the remains of planks, filling SJ 272 (5 Y 5 / 4) was isolated, which contained no grave goods. The excavated part of grave SJ 273 is rectangular-shaped with rounded corners with dimensions of 2. 12 m (W-E) and 1. 88 m (N-S up to the dig profile). The results of research indicate that all the grave goods were lain on the bottom of a wooden case, the existence of which is proved not only by SJ 268, but also by four uncovered post holes, one in each corner (SJ 277 and SJ 295), and two more in the middle of the western and eastern side of the grave respectively (SJ 275 and SJ 293). Although the southern part of the grave was not excavated, it can be assumed that post holes were in the southeastern and southwestern corner of the grave. All the holes are quadrangular, and in the bottom part they become octagonal to make post driving easier. The results of floatation of part of the filling around the ceramic vessels laying in the northeastern part of the grave and the filling of pots indicated the existence of a complex funeral custom which is reflected in the presence of a relatively large number of isolated cultivated plants. Archaeobotanical analysis showed that among grave goods there were cereals (barley, millet, and different types of wheat), leguminous plants (lentil and vetch) as well as a large number of “fruit” objects (melon/cucumber, fig, apple/ pear cherry/sour cherry/sloe, plum, elder and vinegrape). The fig and probably the melon were imported to the Ilok since they are cultivated in warmer (sub) Mediterranean areas, whereas the other sorts were probably cultivated in the surroundings of Ilok. All of the cereals and vetch are carbonized, i. e. they were intentionally or unintentionally burned. Apparently they were laid onto a funeral pile. The remaining “fruit” finds were calcified, i. e. they were laid into the grave fresh or dried, probably when laying the human remains and other grave goods. With the exception of the fig, which had to be dried due to long transport from the Mediterranean region, the remaining fruits could have been laid fresh. Apples, pears, plums, sourberries and elder berries as well as vinegrapes and melons ripen at the same time of the year, i. e. in the early autumn, which suggests that the burial took place in that season. Still one has to keep in mind that “fruit” objects could have been kept in dried state for a relatively long time. The remains of a Roman grave were found in the excavations of 2002, indicating the existence of a cemetery, which had been unknown until now. The grave contained a cremation burial, with grave goods that were laid on the bottom in the northeastern corner and along the eastern side of the wooden case, rectangular in shape, which was probably made of oakwood (Fig. 4). The answers to questions on the chronological position, ethnic determination and the origin of the finds shall be given after an analysis of the grave goods, which can be divided in two groups, the first represented by three ceramic vessels made following the tradition of the La Tène culture, and the other group of finds which are northern Italic imports and which, along with the coin, make dating of the grave possible. These finds consist of a ceramic bowl with thin walls, a glass vessel, a ceramic lamp, a bronze earring and a glass paste play-token. The same origin can be assumed concerning the finds that were preserved only in fragments such as a bronze handle fastening system of a vessel and a needle. On the basis of their shape and technological characteristics, the two hand-made pots with rounded bodies and the wheel-made, S-profiled bowl are connected with the tradition of the La Tène culture. The dark gray to dark brown pots with an admixture of quartz and chuff in abundance, have a rounded body, a flat rim beneath which there is a horizontal groove and a flat bottom (Pl. 1, 1 - 2). These are situla form pots, for which there are numerous parallels in the Late La Tène Scordiscs settlements in eastern Slavonia and Syrmia, found also in Early Roman strata and graves. Of similar origin is also the S-profiled, wheel-made bowl with a rich admixture of quartz (Pl. 2, 1) that was also found in the northeastern corner of the grave. The hand-made pots with rounded bodies and the S-profiled bowl represent the Late La Tène heritage of the Scordiscs and testify to the presence of an autochthonous population in the Early Roman sites of the 1 st century, whose traditions are the strongest in the shapes, techniques and methods of decorating coarse pottery. As indicated by the finds from the settlement layers in Vinkovci, Osijek and Srijemska Mitrovica, the local craftsmen continued the production of recognizable shapes, thus satisfying the needs of the indigenous population. Those forms were decorated by familiar motifs by applying combed or broom-shaped ornaments and by polishing. Ceramic ware with autochthonous features was preserved until the period of the Flavians, suggesting the existence of indigenous peregrine communities which preserved the achievements of their own material culture up until the end of the 1 st century, but due to intensified romanization in the 2 nd century this autochthonous trait The second and larger group of finds from the grave testifying|$|R
