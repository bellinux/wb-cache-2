500|$|Having {{produced}} most of {{the album}} themselves, the band decided to bring <b>in</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> for the mixing. Tracks were sent to several well-known mixers/producers to experiment with and after deciding they liked Nick Launay's ideas best, the band invited him to their studio {{to work on the}} songs further. For a month Launay worked with the album's engineer and co-producer Marcus Strauss on the mixing of each song, with the band regularly driving up from Montreal to assess their progress. In an interview with HitQuarters, Launay described the mixing process as a [...] "playful thing".|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] speak of heartbreak and are direct, {{referring}} to the subject by his first name, Drew. The song describes fancying someone who already interested <b>in</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> and, therefore, maintaining the sentiments a secret. To him, Swift acted {{as though she was}} happy about his relationship, while crying and lamenting at home. Dave Heaton of PopMatters interpreted the lines [...] "And there she goes, so perfectly / The kind of flawless I wish I could be" [...] to address Swift's ideal of perfection and her attempting to meet it, but not succeeding, a predominant theme on Fearless.|$|E
500|$|Bilson and DeMeo then {{submitted}} their seven-page film {{treatment to}} Disney, but the studio put their script through an endless series of revisions. Over five years, Disney fired and rehired Bilson and DeMeo three times. DeMeo explained that [...] "Disney {{felt that they}} needed {{a different approach to}} the script, which meant bringing <b>in</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> But those scripts were thrown out and we were always brought back on". They found the studio's constant tinkering with the screenplay to be a frustrating process as [...] "executives would like previously excised dialogue three months later. Scenes that had been thrown out two years ago were put back in. What was the point"? DeMeo said. One of Bilson and De Meo's significant revisions to the script over the years was to make Cliff and Jenny's romance more believable and avoid cliché aspects that would stereotype Jenny as a damsel in distress. The numerous project delays forced Dear to drop out as director. Joe Johnston, a fan of the comic book, immediately offered his services as director when he found out Disney owned the film rights. Johnston was quickly hired and pre-production started in early 1990. After Bilson and De Meo's third major rewrite, Disney finally greenlighted The Rocketeer.|$|E

500|$|After the {{recording}} sessions were completed, Vig {{and the band}} set out to mix the album. However, after a few days, both Vig and the band members {{realized that they were}} unhappy with how the mixes were turning out. As a result, they decided to call <b>in</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> to oversee the mixing, with Geffen Records imprint DGC supplying a list of possible options. The list contained several familiar names, including Scott Litt (known for his work with R.E.M.) and Ed Stasium (known for his work with The Ramones and The Smithereens). However, Cobain feared that bringing in known mixers would result in the album sounding like the work of those bands. Instead, Cobain chose Andy Wallace (who had co-produced Slayer's 1990 album Seasons in the Abyss) {{from the bottom of the}} list. Novoselic recalled, [...] "We said, 'right on,' because those Slayer records were so heavy." [...] Wallace ran the songs through various special effects boxes and tweaked the drum sounds, completing about one mix per day. Both Wallace and Vig noted years later that upon hearing Wallace's work the band loved the mixes. After the album's release, however, members of Nirvana expressed dissatisfaction with the polished sound the mixer had given Nevermind. Cobain said in Come as You Are, [...] "Looking back on the production of Nevermind, I'm embarrassed by it now. It's closer to a Mötley Crüe record than it is a punk rock record." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Happiness" [...] is {{an upbeat}} dance-pop song, {{influenced}} by house music. The song has a [...] "simple, pleasant melody" [...] {{and has been}} described as an [...] "upbeat track tinged with full good electronica". The music used was deadmau5's [...] "Brazil (2nd Edit)", which was re-edited for the vocals by Stargate. In explaining the song, Jordan revealed it is about [...] "finding love in yourself before you find it <b>in</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> {{because a lot of people}} lose themselves when they fall in love, and they forget who they are, and that's what you've gotta do. You've gotta find someone who loves you for you". Songwriter Autumn Rowe has said in an interview that [...] "Happiness" [...] has an African influence.|$|E
2500|$|The Duggars are devout {{independent}} Baptists. They only watch programs {{they consider}} to be wholesome family television and various historical events. Their Internet service is filtered. They adhere to certain standards of modesty in clothing in accordance with their religious beliefs. Shorts and tank tops are prohibited, and the women do not wear skirts that go above the knee. According to Michelle Duggar, such standards are mandated by scripture. They believe that baring the thigh is [...] "nakedness and shame", and runs the risk of [...] "defrauding" [...] others—or stirring up and arousing [...] "desires <b>in</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> that cannot be righteously fulfilled." [...] They avoid beaches and public swimming areas [...] "because it's just too hard for the guys to try to keep their eyes averted in those situations." [...] Female family members keep their hair long, and males are clean-shaven and short-haired. They practice chaperoned courtship, where the couple gets to know each other in a group setting. The Duggars describe this as [...] "dating with a purpose" [...] and the Daily Mail describes it as a [...] "G-rated alternative to dating." ...|$|E

5000|$|Śraddhā (Sanskrit; saddhā) {{refers to}} a sense of {{commitment}} or trust <b>in</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> or a sense of engagement and commitment to practise.

The opposite of śraddhā is āśraddhya, which refers to the lack of capacity to develop faith in a teacher and the teachings, and therefore being unable to develop energy on the spiritual path.|$|E

5000|$|Carl Jung {{stated the}} shadow {{to be the}} unknown {{dark side of the}} personality.

[...] These projections insulate and harm individuals by acting as a constantly thickening veil of illusion between the ego and the real world.|$|E
