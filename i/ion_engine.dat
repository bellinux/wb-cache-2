It {{was designed to}} use nuclear fission for power, <b>ion</b> <b>engine</b> propulsion, and would have studied Ganymede in greater detail than previously. However, the mission was canceled in 2005 because of budget cuts. Another old proposal was called The Grandeur of Ganymede.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, NASA {{initiated}} the Discovery Program, which {{was intended to}} be a series of low-cost scientific missions. In 1996, the program's study team recommended a mission to explore the asteroid belt using a spacecraft with an <b>ion</b> <b>engine</b> as a high priority. Funding for this program remained problematic for several years, but by 2004 the Dawn vehicle had passed its critical design review and construction proceeded.|$|E
5|$|Xenon is the {{preferred}} propellant for ion propulsion of spacecraft because it has low ionization potential per atomic weight and can be stored as a liquid at near room temperature (under high pressure), yet easily evaporated to feed the engine. Xenon is inert, environmentally friendly, and less corrosive to an <b>ion</b> <b>engine</b> than other fuels such as mercury or caesium. Xenon was first used for satellite ion engines during the 1970s. It was later employed as a propellant for JPL's Deep Space 1 probe, Europe's SMART-1 spacecraft and for the three ion propulsion engines on NASA's Dawn Spacecraft.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ion</b> thrust <b>engines</b> are {{practical}} {{only in the}} vacuum of space and cannot take vehicles through the atmosphere because <b>ion</b> <b>engines</b> do not work {{in the presence of}} <b>ions</b> outside the <b>engine.</b> Additionally, the engine's minuscule thrust cannot overcome any significant air resistance. Spacecraft rely on conventional chemical rockets to initially reach orbit.|$|R
5|$|In 1981, a {{proposal}} for an asteroid mission was submitted to the European Space Agency (ESA). Named the Asteroidal Gravity Optical and Radar Analysis (AGORA), this spacecraft was to launch some time in 1990–1994 and perform two flybys of large asteroids. The preferred target for this mission was Vesta. AGORA would reach the asteroid belt either by a gravitational slingshot trajectory past Mars or {{by means of a}} small <b>ion</b> <b>engine.</b> However, the proposal was refused by the ESA. A joint NASA–ESA asteroid mission was then drawn up for a Multiple Asteroid Orbiter with Solar Electric Propulsion (MAOSEP), with one of the mission profiles including an orbit of Vesta. NASA indicated they were not interested in an asteroid mission. Instead, the ESA set up a technological study of a spacecraft with an ion drive. Other missions to the asteroid belt were proposed in the 1980s by France, Germany, Italy and the United States, but none were approved. Exploration of Vesta by fly-by and impacting penetrator was the second main target of the first plan of the multi-aimed Soviet Vesta mission, developed in cooperation with European countries for realisation in 1991–1994 but canceled due to the Soviet Union disbanding.|$|E
25|$|On September 11, 2014, Dawn ion {{thruster}} unexpectedly ceased firing and the probe began {{operating in a}} triggered safe mode. To avoid a lapse in propulsion, the mission team hastily exchanged the active <b>ion</b> <b>engine</b> and electrical controller with another. The team stated {{that they had a}} plan in place to revive this disabled component later in 2014. The controller in the ion propulsion system may have been damaged by a high-energy particle. Upon exiting the safe mode on September 15, 2014, the probe's {{ion thruster}} resumed normal operation.|$|E
500|$|Star Wars {{literature}} {{states that}} Sienar Fleet Systems manufactures TIE fighters and most TIE variants. TIE fighters' solar panels power a twin <b>ion</b> <b>engine</b> (TIE) system that accelerates gases {{at a high}} speed along almost any vector, affording the ships tremendous speed and maneuverability. Described as lacking a hyperdrive or shield generators, the fragile TIE fighters are deployed in large numbers from bases or larger ships; a Star Destroyer carries a wing of 72 various TIE craft. Expanded Universe material holds that TIE fighter pilots, who undergo intense physical and psychological testing, are trained to be intensely loyal to Emperor Palpatine and the Empire, willing to sacrifice themselves and their wingmates to accomplish their mission. TIE pilots were seen as expendable assets, as it was far cheaper to manufacture {{a great deal of}} standardized spacecraft in overwhelming numbers than it was to fully equip the craft. A TIE fighter consists of the absolute minimum necessary to function as a spacecraft, being essentially nothing more than a cockpit with an engine and weapons. Although Expanded Universe material often describes TIE fighters as lacking an ejection seat, the player can eject from TIE craft in LucasArts' [...] flight simulator. During the events of The Force Awakens, the First Order sees the value in its TIE pilots and equips its TIE fighters with shields to protect their occupants. The First Order also upgraded the TIE fighter to have missiles and a co-pilot/gunner A TIE fighter stolen by Poe Dameron and Finn in The Force Awakens has an ejection seat, allowing both characters to survive a crash.|$|E

2500|$|A type of {{electric}} propulsion, spacecraft such as Dawn use an <b>ion</b> <b>engine.</b> In an <b>ion</b> <b>engine,</b> electric power {{is used to}} create charged particles of the fuel, usually the gas xenon, and accelerate them to extremely high velocities. The exhaust velocity of conventional rockets {{is limited by the}} chemical energy stored in the fuel’s molecular bonds, which limits the thrust to about 5km/s. [...] This gives them power (for lift-off from Earth, for example) but limits the top speed. By contrast, ion engines have low force, but the top speed in principle is limited only by the electrical power available on the spacecraft and on the gas ions being accelerated. The exhaust speed of the charged particles range from 15km/s to 35km/s.|$|E
2500|$|On June 30, 2015, Dawn {{experienced}} a software glitch when an anomaly in its orientation system occurred.

Astrium was involved in developing a European Space Agency plan for a sample return mission to Mars, as part of the ESA's Aurora programme, and sending a mission to Phobos with its low gravity was seen as a good opportunity for testing and proving the technologies required for an eventual sample return mission to Mars.

500|$|Mercury was a {{propellant}} {{for early}} <b>ion</b> <b>engines</b> in electric space propulsion systems.
