5000|$|This {{process is}} what changes juicy rare steak to dry steak when well-done. It creates weeping in {{scrambled}} eggs, with dry protein curd swimming in released moisture. It causes <b>emulsified</b> <b>sauces,</b> such as hollandaise, to [...] "break." [...] It creates unsightly moisture pockets within baked custard {{dishes such as}} flan or crème brûlée.|$|E
50|$|An {{immersion}} blender, stick blender, wand blender, hand blender, or Bermixer (after {{the brand}} name of professional models made by Dito-Electrolux) is a kitchen blade grinder used to blend ingredients or purée food in the container {{in which they are}} being prepared. Larger immersion blenders for commercial use are sometimes nicknamed boat motors (popularized by Emeril Lagasse and Alton Brown). Uses include puréeing soups and <b>emulsifying</b> <b>sauces.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Beurre blanc — {{literally}} {{translated from}} French as [...] "white butter" [...] — {{is a hot}} <b>emulsified</b> butter <b>sauce</b> made with a reduction of vinegar and/or white wine (normally Muscadet) and grey shallots into which cold, whole butter is blended off the heat to prevent separation. The small amounts of lecithin and other emulsifiers naturally found in butter are used to form an oil-in-water emulsion. Although similar to hollandaise in concept, it is considered neither a classic leading nor compound sauce. This sauce originates in Loire Valley cuisine.|$|R
5000|$|In a 1820 work, Viard {{describes}} {{something like}} the more familiar <b>emulsified</b> version:This <b>sauce</b> is made to [...] "take" [...] in many ways: with raw egg yolks, with gelatine, with veal or veal brain glaze. The most common method {{is to take a}} raw egg yolk in a small terrine, with a little salt and lemon juice: take a wooden spoon, turn it while letting a trickle of oil fall and stirring constantly; as your sauce thickens, add a little vinegar; put in too a pound of good oil: serve your sauce with good salt: serve it white or green, adding green of ravigote or green of spinach.This sauce is used for cold fish entrees, or salad of vegetables cooked in salt water.|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{spoilage}} of shelf-stable acidified sauces {{is predominantly}} caused by {{lactic acid bacteria}} and yeasts. A specific spoilage yeast in these products is Zygosaccharomyces bailii, as this fructophilic, osmotolerant, and weak acid resistant yeast is difficult to control. A growth/no growth model was developed describing the influence of (i) pH in a range from pH 3. 0 to pH 5. 0 (5 levels), (ii) acetic acid in a range from 0 to 3. 5 % (w/v), and (iii) lactic acid in a range from 0 to 3. 0 % (w/v). aw was fixed {{at a level of}} 0. 95 which is representative for acidified sauces with high sugar content. Modified Sabouraud medium was inoculated at ± 104 CFU/ml, incubated at 30 °C and growth was assessed by optical density measurements. All combinations of environmental conditions were tested in at least twelve replicates, yielding precise values for the probability of growth. Results showed that replacing acetic acid by lactic acid, which has a milder taste, may imply some risks on food spoilage because, under some conditions, stimulation of growth by lactic acid was observed. This stimulation had also consequences on the model development: (i) only ordinary logistic regression models were able to describe this phenomenon due to their flexible behaviour, (ii) it was necessary to split up the data set into two subsets to have the best description of the obtained data. Two different ordinary logistic regression models were fitted on these data sets taking either the total acid concentration as one of the explanatory variables or differentiating between the undissociated and dissociated acid concentrations. The obtained models were compared with the CIMSCEE code [CIMSCEE, 1992. Code for the production of microbiologically safe and stable <b>emulsified</b> and non-emulsified <b>sauces</b> containing acetic acid. Comité des Industries des Mayonnaise et Sauces Condimentaires, de la Communauté Economique Européenne, Brussels, Belgium], a formula which is nowadays often used by the food industry to predict the stability of acidified products based on the undissociated acetic acid, NaCl and sugars concentration. Comparing this formula and the newly developed models showed that the CIMSCEE code made a slight underestimation of the growth probability. Advantages of the newly developed models are the description of the gradual transition zone between growth and no growth and the incorporation of the effect of lactic acid, alone or in combination with acetic acid. status: publishe...|$|R
