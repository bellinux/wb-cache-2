500|$|... "Commander" [...] is an electro-house-R song, set in {{a common}} time {{signature}} of 125beats per minute. It was written by Kelly Rowland, Rico Love, David Guetta and Sandy Vee with deliberate grammar errors such as [...] "there's no other who do it like I do it" [...] and [...] "you won't find no lady who does it like I does it". The lyrics have themes around hair, fashion and competing with other women. Guetta also produced the synthesized dance beats, {{which is similar to}} his other production, [...] "Sexy Bitch". The end portions of the song were compared to some of the works by hip-hop producer Timbaland. Rowland explained that the hook of the song, [...] "Commander", should be associated with dance instead of the military. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>command</b> you to dance ...

500|$|The {{battle was}} tactically inconclusive, {{although}} Lee technically was defeated because he withdrew first {{from the battlefield}} and retreated back to Virginia. McClellan wired to Washington, [...] "Our victory was complete. The enemy is driven back into Virginia." [...] Yet there was obvious disappointment that McClellan had not crushed Lee, who was fighting with a smaller army with its back to the Potomac River. Although McClellan's subordinates can claim their share of responsibility for delays (such as Ambrose Burnside's misadventures at Burnside Bridge) and blunders (Edwin V. Sumner's attack without reconnaissance), these were localized problems from which the full army could have recovered. As with the decisive battles in the Seven Days, McClellan's headquarters were {{too far to the}} rear to allow his personal control over the battle. He made no use of his cavalry forces for reconnaissance. He did not share his overall battle plans with his corps commanders, which prevented them from using initiative outside of their sectors. And he was far too willing to accept cautious advice about saving his reserves, such as when a significant breakthrough {{in the center of the}} Confederate line could have been exploited, but Fitz John Porter is said to have told McClellan, [...] "Remember, General, <b>I</b> <b>command</b> the last reserve of the last Army of the Republic." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{asked to}} which commandment [...] refers when it says, [...] "For if you shall {{diligently}} keep all this commandment that <b>I</b> <b>command</b> you, to do it, {{to love the}} Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, and to cleave to Him, then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves."

2500|$|Reading [...] "For this commandment that <b>I</b> <b>command</b> {{you this}} day [...] [...] [...] is very near to you, in your mouth, {{and in your}} heart," [...] a Midrash related the commandments to the human body. The Midrash taught that [...] bears out [...] "For they are life to those who find them, and health to all their flesh." [...] Rabbi Hiyya taught {{that the law is}} a salve for the eye, an {{emollient}} for a wound, and a root-drink for the bowels. The law is a salve for the eye, as [...] says, [...] "The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes." [...] The law is an emollient for a wound, as [...] says, [...] "It shall be health to your navel." [...] And the law is a root-drink for the bowels, as [...] continues, [...] "And marrow to your bones." [...] Another Midrash read [...] "For this commandment that <b>I</b> <b>command</b> you this day [...] [...] [...] is very near to you, in your mouth," [...] together with [...] "For they are life to those who find them," [...] to teach that the commandments are life for those who speak them aloud. The Midrash related that a disciple of Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob used to run through all of his study in a single hour, and when once when he fell ill, he forgot all that he had learned, because he did not speak the words out loud. When, however, Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob prayed for him, all his learning came back to him. Another Midrash read [...] together with [...] to teach that the commandments are life to those who tell them to others. Another Midrash read [...] together with [...] "For they are life to those who find them," [...] to teach that the commandments are life to those who carry out the commandments completely, for Deuteronomy repeatedly says, [...] "all the commandment" [...] ( [...] , kol ha-mitzvah), which the Midrash taught means until one completely carries out all the precepts. And the Midrash taught that the conclusion of [...] "health to all their flesh," [...] refers to all the parts of the body, demonstrating the force of [...] "For this commandment that <b>I</b> <b>command</b> you this day [...] [...] [...] is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart." ...|$|E

The brigade of Brig. Gen. Winfield S. Featherston began falling back under heavy fire when its division commander, Maj. Gen. William W. Loring, confronted them, shouting, [...] "Great God.
