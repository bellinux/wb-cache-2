50|$|Beginning in 1765, {{lumber and}} grist mills were {{established}} on Mill Street, with taverns built soon thereafter on Parade Street. About 1822, the courthouse was built, which would become county {{seat at the}} creation of Belknap County in 1840. In 1823, the Belknap Mill was built to manufacture textiles; in operation by 1828, the structure is today a museum listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is the oldest unaltered brick textile mill in the country. Local industry produced lumber, textiles, shoes, <b>hosiery,</b> <b>knitting</b> machinery and needles. But the city's largest employer would be the Laconia Car Company, builder of rail, trolley and subway cars. Started in 1848, it lasted until the 1930s.

40|$|Global {{demand for}} knitted {{garments}} {{is growing at}} a faster rate than that of woven items. Currently around 50 % of clothing needs in the developed countries is met by knit goods. So ensuring the required quality in a knitted fabric is a vital issue for the manufacturer. One of the major problems encountered in knitted fabric is spirality. It affects particularly single jersey fabric and presents a serious problem during garment confection and use. So controlling spirality is a basic requirement for producing quality knitted fabric. Though there are several factors that contribute to knitted fabric spirality, yarn twist and relative tightness of the fabric are said tobe the most significant ones. In this work the basic single jersey fabric, i. e. plain jersey cotton fabrics were produced by a <b>Hosiery</b> <b>knitting</b> machine and spirality values were observed for different yarn T. P. I. and tightness factor at relaxed state. It was found that tightness factor has a direct influence on knitted fabric spirality {{with a high degree of}} correlation. The work thus gives an idea to deal this problem by controlling the knitting parameters...|$|E

India's textile industry has transformed in recent years from a declining sector to a rapidly developing one.

From 2004 to 2008, total investment into the textile sector increased by 27billion dollars. Ludhiana produces 90% of woollens in India and is known as the Manchester of India.

Expanding textile centres such as Ichalkaranji enjoy one of the highest per-capita incomes in the country.

50|$|In {{the second}} half of the century, {{particularly}} once the Civil War had ended, the textile industry's growth in the town fueled another boom. The first mill, the Troy Manufacturing Co., was opened on Ontario Street in 1843. It was thought to be the first in the country devoted to manufacturing <b>hosiery</b> and <b>knit</b> products. It failed within a decade, but a new owner took over and Cohoes went from three mills in 1852 to 27 by 1886, employing 4,000 people. The thousand-foot (300 m) Harmony Mills complex was the world's largest cotton processing facility when it opened in 1872, and later came to be identified with the town.The earlier growth expanded, and by 1870 11,100 had settled in the village. That year it reincorporated as a city. The new construction, and reconstruction and expansion of existing properties, brought new homes and churches to the downtown area. One of the latter, St. John's Episcopal Church, was designed by Richard Upjohn, the architect of many of America's notable churches from that era, and built in 1870. It was destroyed by fire a quarter-century later, and replaced by a newer building but its rectory remains in use. The Music Hall, the district's best Second Empire-style building, was opened in 1874.|$|R

The industry had burgeoned after the Civil War: only four of the thirty four silk exhibitors (representing America 2 ̆ 7 s two hundred twenty four silk manufacturers and dealers) could trace their origins to the 2 ̆ 2 times which tried the souls of the silk producers and manufacturers. 2 ̆ 2 The Nonotuck Silk Company, the unlikely descendant of the 18302 ̆ 7 s moth-to-cloth Northampton Silk Company, was one that could and did. After falling twice from the rickety carousel of early nineteenth century enterprises, it seized the brass ring and held on. The key to its success was its manufacture of the first usable 2 ̆ 2 machine twist, 2 ̆ 2 a silk thread strong and smooth enough to withstand the unprecedented demands of the newly invented sewing machine. Nonotuck became one of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s leading silk thread manufactures and Northampton 2 ̆ 7 s largest employer for decades. Yet the details of this key invention have never been spelled out. This paper attempts to fill that gap. The sericulture years: 1830 - 1850. The story begins, not in 1838 as the trade card suggests, but eight years earlier, when Samuel Whitmarsh, a 30 -year-old Boston native, bought a large estate near the center of Northampton with the proceeds of a successful tailoring business in New York and built cocoonery for two million silkworms and two greenhouses for mulberry shoots next to his mansion. Raising silkworm was a popular spring pastime in Northampton in the 18202 ̆ 7 s; Whitmarsh tugged the silkworm from cottage to factory, from hobby to industry. A former linseed oil mill three miles three miles to the north along the Mill River served as his first factory. A few years later, backed by a group of New York and Connecticut financiers, Whitmarsh built a four-story brick one nearby. The new 7 factory hummed with up-to-the-minute machinery. Tourists flocked to see his power loom churn out silk ribbons and vesting. The Northampton Silk Company was incorporated in 1838. But some whispered that the manufacture was mostly a show to persuade the gullible to invest in mulberry trees, whose price increased tenfold in a few short years. The Northampton Silk Company burst with the mulberry bubble. Bankrupt, Whitmarsh withdrew in 1840. Out but not down, he tried, again unsuccessfully, to establish a silk industry in Jamaica a few years later. At the time of his death, in Northampton in 1875, he was planning to raise silk in California...|$|R
