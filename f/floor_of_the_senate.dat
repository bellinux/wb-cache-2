5|$|Both {{supporters}} and critics of Cheney regard {{him as a}} shrewd and knowledgeable politician who knows the functions and intricacies of the federal government. A sign of Cheney's active policy-making role was then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert's provision of an office near the House floor for Cheney {{in addition to his}} office in the West Wing, his ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building, and his Senate offices (one in the Dirksen Senate Office Building and another off the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate).</b>|$|E
5|$|Turnbull's {{willingness}} {{to negotiate with}} the government was met with opposition from some Coalition MPs. By September 2009, The Australian was reporting that only 12 of the 59 Liberal backbenchers supported negotiations. On 18 October 2009, Turnbull fronted a meeting of Coalition MPs with a proposal to negotiate amendments to the government's ETS. This meeting supported his proposal, in what was seen as a test of Turnbull's leadership. However, there was speculation that a number of Coalition Senators would defy Turnbull and cross the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> to vote against any ETS legislation. The ETS opponents argued that it would be premature for Parliament to pass ETS legislation before the Copenhagen Summit on climate change.|$|E

25|$|Crittenden's {{proposals}} were debated by a specially-selected Committee of Thirteen. The proposals provided for, among other things, {{an extension of}} the Missouri Compromise line dividing the territories to the Pacific Ocean, bringing his efforts directly in conflict with the 1860 Republican Platform and the personal views of President-elect Abraham Lincoln, who had made known his objections. The compromise was rejected by the committee on December 22 by a vote of 7–6. Crittenden later brought the issue to the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> as a proposal to have his compromise made subject to a national referendum, but the Senate rejected it on January 16, by a vote of 25–23.|$|E
25|$|Most {{committee}} work {{is performed}} by 16 standing committees, {{each of which}} has jurisdiction over a field such as finance or foreign relations. Each standing committee may consider, amend, and report bills that fall under its jurisdiction. Furthermore, each standing committee considers presidential nominations to offices related to its jurisdiction. (For instance, the Judiciary Committee considers nominees for judgeships, and the Foreign Relations Committee considers nominees for positions in the Department of State.) Committees may block nominees and impede bills from reaching the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> Standing committees also oversee the departments and agencies of the executive branch. In discharging their duties, standing committees have the power to hold hearings and to subpoena witnesses and evidence.|$|E
25|$|Clay {{introduced}} the negotiated tariff bill on February 12, {{and it was}} immediately referred to a select committee consisting of Clay as chairman, Felix Grundy of Tennessee, George M. Dallas of Pennsylvania, William Cabell Rives of Virginia, Webster, John M. Clayton of Delaware, and Calhoun. On February 21 the committee reported a bill to the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> which was largely the original bill proposed by Clay. The Tariff of 1832 would continue except that reduction of all rates above 20% would be reduced by one tenth every two years with the final reductions back to 20% coming in 1842. Protectionism as a principle was not abandoned and provisions were made for raising the tariff if national interests demanded it.|$|E

25|$|The Capitol has a {{long history}} in art of the United States, {{beginning}} in 1856 with Italian/Greek American artist Constantino Brumidi and his murals in the hallways of the first <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> side of the Capitol. The murals, known as the Brumidi Corridors, reflect great moments and people in United States history. Among the original works are those depicting Benjamin Franklin, John Fitch, Robert Fulton, and events such as the Cession of Louisiana. Also decorating the walls are animals, insects and natural flora indigenous to the United States. Brumidi's design left many spaces open so that future events in United States history could be added. Among those added are the Spirit of St. Louis, the Moon landing, and the Space Shuttle Challenger shuttle crew.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{moving to}} the Senate in March 1927, Hayden {{continued}} {{his opposition to the}} Boulder Canyon Project. With growing national support for the project, however, it became obvious to Hayden that passage of the bill was inevitable. Seeking time to gain terms more favorable to Arizona, he continued his opposition with the aid of two filibusters from Arizona's other Senator, Henry F. Ashurst, and was able to delay a vote of the full Senate on the measure {{until the end of the}} 70th Congress' first session. When the Swing-Johnston bill came up for a vote on May 28, 1928 Hayden made his first speech from the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> a filibuster in which he spoke for nine hours during an all-night session before allowing Ashurst to take over for another twelve hours.|$|E
25|$|The decree was {{condemned}} by the Indian and United States governments {{as a violation}} of religious freedom. Widespread protests against the Taliban regime broke out in Bhopal, India. In the United States, the chairman of the Anti-Defamation League Abraham Foxman compared the decree to the practices of Nazi Germany, where Jews were required to wear labels which identified them as such. The comparison was also drawn by California Democrat and holocaust survivor Tom Lantos, and New York Democrat and author of the bipartisan 'Sense of the Congress' non-binding resolution against the anti-Hindu decree Eliot L Engel. In the United States, congressmen and several lawmakers. wore yellow badges on the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> during the debate as a demonstration of their solidarity with the Hindu minority in Afghanistan.|$|E

25|$|For {{close to}} three years, of the {{seventeen}} senators that were elected under the NPP in the 2004 General Elections, six remained loyal to McClintock's presidency, thus denying his opponents the unanimity required by Senate Rules II and VI {{to declare the}} presidency vacant. As McClintock stripped eight of the ten senators who supported Rosselló's claim for the Presidency of the chairmanships of Senate committees, leaving a total of ten committees {{under the leadership of}} the five NPP senators who still backed him and two, the Ethics and the Public Safety committees remained under the leadership of senators supporting Rosselló. Many Capitol insiders had claimed that this had the effect of overflowing committees with work and slowing down the process of bills becoming laws. However, when that issue was raised on the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> McClintock ordered an investigation on legislative productivity that he stated statistically demonstrated that committee output was higher during the third legislative session (after committee and chairmanship consolidations) than during the first.|$|E
25|$|A fight erupted on the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> {{over the}} bridge provision. Both the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia {{approved}} the bridge. But many Senators were unhappy that the federal budget was increasing rapidly. The bill was held up for 10 months, while Senators worked {{behind the scenes to}} resolve these differences. The D.C. appropriations bill did not reach the Senate floor for another 10 months. When the bill did reach the chamber floor on February 15, 1905, Senator Stephen B. Elkins (R-West Virginia) demanded that the bridge provision be removed. Senator William B. Allison (R-Iowa) rose to support the expenditure. Their floor fight lasted three full days. Elkins claimed on February 16 that no citizens of the city wanted the bridge, and he demanded a full Senate vote on the bridge amendment. Senator Allison replied on February 17 by bringing in petitions from the Brightwood Citizens Association and the Mt. Pleasant Citizens Association asking for construction of the bridge, and pointing out that these petitions had been delivered to the Senate some months ago. Although Elkins won a vote on the amendment, the Senate overwhelmingly approved its inclusion in the final bill on February 17, ending the three-day floor fight.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{condemnation}} proceeded {{against other}} property {{owners in the}} area. At this time, the eminent domain procedures governing the District of Columbia required the city to condemn land, and for the landowner to fight the condemnation in court before a jury. The jury then determined if the condemnation was required, and what compensation should be awarded the property owner. In two separate proceedings, juries found land to be worth just 1 cent per square foot. Senator James McMillan (R-Michigan), chair of the Senate District of Columbia Committee, brought S.2637 to the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> on June 24. McMillan argued that the cemetery trustees were not opposed to the road, just to the {{price to be paid}} for the condemned land. Senator George Graham Vest (D-Missouri) asked that the bill be temporarily tabled, and it was. On July 14, Senator Matt Whitaker Ransom (D-North Carolina) presented the Senate with a petition from 1,000 cemetery lotholders opposed to the Senate and House bills. (PHC director George Wagner later characterized the dispute over lotholder support as one Senator lying to another.) The objections raised by Vest and other senators were seemingly resolved by July 24, when McMillan again called the bill for a vote on the Senate floor. One change to the bill had been made, providing for federally-financed construction of a retaining wall on cemetery property if one was needed. But once more the bill was put on hold. Senator David Turpie (D-Indiana) objected to the bill overall, and Senator Francis Cockrell (D-Missouri) wanted a cap put on the price of the compensation.|$|E
