5|$|Ardhanarishvara {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{iconographic}} forms of Shiva. It is found in more or less all temples and shrines dedicated to Shiva all over India and South-east Asia. There <b>is</b> <b>ample</b> <b>evidence</b> from texts and the multiple depictions of the Ardhanarishvara in stone to suggest that a cult centred around the deity may have existed. The cult may have had occasional followers, but was never aligned to any sect. This cult focusing on the joint worship of Shiva and the Goddess may even have had a high position in Hinduism, but when and how it faded away remains a mystery. Though a popular iconographic form, temples dedicated to the deity are few. A popular one is located in Thiruchengode, while five others are located in Kallakkurichi taluk, all of them in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's {{theory has}} {{important}} astrophysical implications. For example, it implies {{the existence of}} black holes—regions of space in which space and time are distorted {{in such a way}} that nothing, not even light, can escape—as an end-state for massive stars. There <b>is</b> <b>ample</b> <b>evidence</b> that the intense radiation emitted by certain kinds of astronomical objects is due to black holes; for example, microquasars and active galactic nuclei result from the presence of stellar black holes and supermassive black holes, respectively. The bending of light by gravity can lead to the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, in which multiple images of the same distant astronomical object are visible in the sky. General relativity also predicts the existence of gravitational waves, which have since been observed directly by physics collaboration LIGO. In addition, general relativity is the basis of current cosmological models of a consistently expanding universe.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{policies}} and practices which resulted in individuals being punished for peacefully exercising their human rights by sending them to RTL have not fundamentally changed: quite the contrary. There <b>is</b> <b>ample</b> <b>evidence</b> that such policies and practices are continuing in full force. The latest anti-Falun Gong campaign, launched earlier this year and intended to operate for three years, shows that the CCP’s determination to rid China of this spiritual group has not abated. Falun Gong practitioners continue to be punished through criminal prosecution and being sent to “brainwashing centres” {{and other forms of}} arbitrary detention. Petitioners likewise continue to be subjected to harassment, forcibly committed to mental institutions and sent to “black jails” and other forms of arbitrary detention. Human rights defenders, democracy advocates, whistle-blowers and other political activists are also being increasingly targeted through criminal detention, “black jails”, short-term administrative detention, and enforced disappearances, rather than RTL.|$|E

25|$|Author Martin Bollinger {{reports that}} during the ship's Soviet career there <b>is</b> <b>ample</b> <b>evidence</b> that Dzhurma was used on Gulag routes between 1936 and 1950. As {{a part of the}} Dalstroy fleet, the ships «Ягода» (later renamed «Дальстрой»), «Кулу», «Джурма» transported prisoners from Vladivostok, {{endpoint}} of the Transsiberian railway, across the Sea of Okhotsk to Kolyma via Nagayevo port, which was the port of Magadan city. Travel time to Magadan was about 6 to 14 days; trips to the Arctic were seasonal as during the winter the sea froze over. A steamer would make about ten trips a year. Conditions were horrendous, and many people did not survive the trip.|$|E
25|$|The great Library of Alexandria {{was later}} burned. There {{is a growing}} {{consensus}} among historians that the Library of Alexandria likely suffered from several destructive events, but that the destruction of Alexandria's pagan temples in the late 4th century {{was probably the most}} severe and final one. The evidence for that destruction is the most definitive and secure. Caesar's invasion may well have led to the loss of some 40,000-70,000 scrolls in a warehouse adjacent to the port (as Luciano Canfora argues, they were likely copies produced by the Library intended for export), but it is unlikely to have affected the Library or Museum, given that there <b>is</b> <b>ample</b> <b>evidence</b> that both existed later.|$|E
50|$|There <b>are</b> <b>ample</b> <b>evidence</b> {{suggesting}} that financial sector development plays {{a significant role}} in economic development. It promotes economic growth through capital accumulation and technological advancement by boosting savings rate, delivering information about investment, optimizing the allocation of capital, mobilizing and pooling savings, and facilitating and encouraging foreign capital inflows. A meta-analysis of 67 empirical studies finds that financial development is robustly associated with economic growth.|$|R

25|$|By {{the time}} of the Uruk period (c. 4100–2900 BC calibrated), the volume of trade goods transported along the canals and rivers of {{southern}} Mesopotamia facilitated the rise of many large, stratified, temple-centered cities (with populations of over 10,000 people) where centralized administrations employed specialized workers. It is fairly certain that it was during the Uruk period that Sumerian cities began to make use of slave labor captured from the hill country, and there <b>is</b> <b>ample</b> <b>evidence</b> for captured slaves as workers in the earliest texts. Artifacts, and even colonies of this Uruk civilization have been found over a wide area—from the Taurus Mountains in Turkey, to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, and as far east as central Iran.|$|E
25|$|In the Tiberian masoretic codices, {{the unique}} system of cantillation for Sifrei Emet is complemented by a scribal layout {{unlike that of}} the rest of the Bible: Instead of the three narrow columns per page typical of these codices, Sifrei Emet are written in two wide columns per page. In each line of these wide columns text begins on the right, {{followed}} by a gap, and then continued by further text until the left margin of the column. Although there <b>is</b> <b>ample</b> <b>evidence</b> that the scribes attempted to place the gaps in the middle of the lines at the points where the cantillation divides the verses, they often did not succeed in doing so because of space limitations. Modern editions based upon the Aleppo Codex have implemented the idea fully by allowing wide full-page columns for Psalms, Proverbs, and Job.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{findings}} show people {{settled in the}} middle alpine region, later to be called Tyrol, when the glaciers retreated and flora and fauna revived, after {{the last ice age}} ended around 12,000 BC. Artifacts found on the Seiser Alm date to the Upper Paleolithic era. In the valley bottoms near Bolzano, Brixen and Salorno, mesolithic hunters resting places were discovered. Stone artefacts recovered there were dated to the 8th millennia BC. Discovery of Ötzi on the Similaun glacier in 1991 proved man had already crossed the highest Alpine passes 5000 years ago. Sedentary settlements of farmers and herders {{can be traced back to}} 5000 BC. There <b>is</b> <b>ample</b> <b>evidence</b> of settlements in the main and side valleys during the early and middle Bronze Age (1800-1300 BC). Preferred settlement sites were sunny terraces on the valleys slopes, and hill tops in the middle heights.|$|E

The first set of these elements surrounded the mouth to form the jaw. There <b>are</b> <b>ample</b> <b>evidences</b> that vertebrate jaws are homologous to the gill arches of jawless fishes. The upper portion of the second embryonic arch supporting the gill became the hyomandibular bone of jawed fishes, which supports the skull and therefore links the jaw to the cranium.|$|R
