The performance of the Sanskrit sloka, Tamil viruttam and Telugu padyamu or sisapadya forms are particularly unique. Though these forms consist of lyric-based verses, musicians improvise raga phrases <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>rhythm,</b> like an alapana, so both the sound value, {{and the meaning of}} the text, guide the musician through elaborate melodic improvisations. Forms such as the divya prabandham, thevaram and ugabhoga are often performed similarly, however, these forms can also have a set melody and rhythm like the devaranama, javali, padam, thillana and thiruppugazh forms.|$|E

He sang <b>in</b> the <b>free</b> <b>rhythm</b> of work songs, such as the migrant cotton pickers he performed for might have sung, which posed a challenge for those accompanying him. His singing is difficult to follow, and on his records his accompanists can often be heard resetting their watches to [...] "Alexander time".Lonnie Johnson devised free-form guitar melodies in counterpoint to Alexander's vocal lines.|$|R
5000|$|Clausulae {{emerged from}} the {{compositional}} practices of the Notre Dame school in Paris c. 1160-1250 (during the stylistic period known as ars antiqua), especially those of the composers Léonin and Pérotin. Rather than write entirely new music, the preference was to take existing music, that is, plainchant melodies, and develop or improve upon them. Pérotin's clausulae {{make use of the}} rhythmic modes, whose strict metrical feet necessitated that voices change notes together (discantus). This was in contrast to the earlier practice of one voice moving <b>in</b> a <b>free</b> <b>rhythm</b> above a [...] "tenor" [...] voice (Latin tenere: [...] "to hold") sustaining the long notes of a cantus firmus. The tenor line was often repeated to allow for expansion of the clausula; this was the origin of the technique known as isorhythm.|$|R

5000|$|Meditations is a 1966 album by John Coltrane. The {{album was}} {{considered}} the [...] "spiritual follow-up to A Love Supreme." [...] It features Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders as soloists, both playing tenor saxophones.

Goin' Home is mostly tempoless, {{as most of}} the pieces are performed <b>in</b> a rubato-like <b>free</b> <b>rhythm.</b> Shepp and Parlan perform sudden accelerations and intended delays and halts, particularly at the end of bars, phrases, and sections in a piece. Most of the spirituals have a thirty-two-bar form, with the eight-bar section comprising four two-bar phrases wherein two choruses of the spiritual are played. Shepp and Parlan's interpretations include few choruses from the original spirituals.|$|R

Normal accents re-occur regularly providing systematical grouping (measures). Measured rhythm (additive rhythm) also calculates each time value as a multiple or fraction of a specified time unit but the accents do not recur regularly within the cycle. <b>Free</b> <b>rhythm</b> is where there is neither , such as in Christian chant, which has a basic pulse but a <b>freer</b> <b>rhythm,</b> like the rhythm of prose compared to that of verse [...] See Free time (music).|$|R

40|$|The {{locomotor}} {{activity of}} the crab Pseudothelphusa americana displays a circadian rhythm consisting of two main bouts, a morning (lights-on related) and an evening (lights-off related) bout. The aim of the present work is to elucidate whether each bout of activity displays similar phase response shifts when exposed to a 2 h light pulse (150 lux). Phase shifts were evaluated <b>in</b> the <b>free</b> running <b>rhythm</b> under constant darkness from animals previously entrained to a light-dark regimen. Results obtained show that phase shifts are observed for both morning and evening peaks during the subjective day, while during the subjective night, only the evening peak of activity displays significant phase shifts. The aforementioned indicates that a multi-oscillatory system may drive the locomotor activity circadian rhythm in the fresh water crab Pseudothelphusa americana, and the differences in PRC shapes for evening and morning peaks could represent the light sensitivity of two different oscillators...|$|R

40|$|This book {{presents}} the vocal art music of Kabul as performed by Ustad Amir Mohammad. At {{the heart of}} Kabul's vocal art music is the ghazal, a highly flexible song form using Persian (or Pashto) texts derived {{from a variety of}} sources. Much of this poetry is in the Sufi tradition, with frequent metaphoric allusions to love, wine and intoxication. In musical terms, the Kabuli ghazal style is related to ghazal singing in India and Pakistan, but the setting of the texts to music is distinctly Afghan, with interpolated couplets sung <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>rhythm,</b> fast instrumental sections and dramatic rhythmic cadences. As befits a Sufi music, it has a regularly repeated cyclical structure with trance-inducing properties. Central to the book is the audio CD, containing six ghazals, one mosammat and one Afghan-style tarâna, all recorded by John Baily between 1974 and 1976 in the city of Herat, in western Afghanistan. At that time Ustad Amir Mohammad was Herat's most sought-after singer in the Kabuli style, playing mainly at wedding parties of wealthy Heratis. In these valuable recordings he is accompanied by two outstanding local musicians, Rahim Khushnawaz on rubâb, and Gada Mohammad on dutâr...|$|E
50|$|Doina is poetic {{and often}} melancholic, {{sometimes}} {{compared to the}} blues for that reason. Doinas are often played with a slow, <b>free</b> <b>rhythm</b> melody against a fast accompaniment pattern in fixed tempo, giving an overall feeling of rhythmic tension. Melodies are sometimes repeated in differing songs, and typically follow a descending pattern.|$|R

He wrote modernistic picaresque novels and short stories popular in the 1920s, often set in Western Europe (The Extraordinary Adventures of Julio Jurenito and his Disciples (1922), Thirteen Pipes). Ehrenburg continued to write philosophical poetry, using more <b>freed</b> <b>rhythms</b> than <b>in</b> the 1910s.|$|R
50|$|In some of {{his pieces}} he employs {{traditional}} forms and meters (though with considerable latitude), and in others he uses more open forms and <b>freer</b> <b>rhythms,</b> while still maintaining a voice uniquely his own.

50|$|Similarly, {{in early}} 17th-century Germany, Georg Rudolf Weckherlin {{advocated}} for an alexandrine with <b>free</b> <b>rhythms,</b> reflecting French practice; whereas Martin Opitz advocated for a strict accentual-syllabic iambic alexandrine {{in imitation of}} contemporary Dutch practice — and German poets followed Opitz.

50|$|The pesindhèn may sing {{together}} with a gerong (male chorus), but their styles and words will be different.

50|$|Symphony No. 3 {{exhibits}} {{a number of}} stylistic features which exemplify Penderecki's music of the 1980s, including motor <b>rhythms,</b> passages of <b>free</b> <b>rhythm,</b> chromatic scalar figures and emphasis on the minor second, dissonant intervals, and expanded percussion section. The work's dense counterpoint, innovative instrumentation, free harmonies, and complex rhythms make it stylistically similar to Penderecki's 1986 opera The Black Mask.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the elementary school children 2 ̆ 7 s consciousness and musical ability of Japanese Folk songs. The third and fifth grade school children were taught two Japanese Folk songs entitled" Obonai-bushi which has regular rhythm and "Akitanagamochi-uta" which has <b>free</b> <b>rhythm.</b> As a result of analyzing questionnaires and a videotape the following points became clear. 1) The elementary school children have impression that Japanese Folk Songs are old and slow songs especially for the free rhythmic songs. 2) They prefer "Obonai-bushi which has regular rhythm to "Akitanagamochi-uta" which has <b>free</b> <b>rhythm.</b> 3) The third grade children felt that they could sing Japanese Folk Songs well and it was not difficult to sing. It is presumed that the third grade school children have more acceptability for unfamiliar musicstyles and forms than the fifth grade school children. 4) It is proper that elementary school children should mainly learn Japanese Folk Songs which are simpleand have regular rhythm at fist step before they learn the songs which have complicated rhythm and mellismatic tunes...|$|R
