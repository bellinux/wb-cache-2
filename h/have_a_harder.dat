This also protects against deformation by heavy weights like pianos.|$|E

25|$|Children with Down {{syndrome}} {{have increased}} difficulty forming friendships. They experience a language delay {{causing them to}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> time playing with other children. Most children with Down syndrome may prefer to watch other students and play alongside a friend but not with them, mostly because they understand more than they can outwardly express. In preschool years, children with Down syndrome can benefit from the classroom setting, surrounded by other children and less dependent on adult aid. Children with this disability benefit {{from a variety of}} interactions with both adults and children. At school, ensuring an inclusive environment in the classroom can be difficult, but proximity to close friends can be crucial for social development.|$|E
25|$|Although incarceration {{in general}} {{has a huge}} effect on employment, the effects become even more {{pronounced}} when looking at race. Devah Pager performed a study in 2003 and found that white males with no criminal record had a 34% chance of callback compared to 17% for white males with a criminal record. Black males with no criminal record were called back {{at a rate of}} 14% while the rate dropped to 5% for those with a criminal record. Black men with no criminal background <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> time finding employment than white men who have a history of criminal activity. While having a criminal record decreases the chance of a callback for white men by 50%, it decreases the callback chances for black men by 64%.|$|E

25|$|Schwartz's firm {{worked on}} the {{proposal}} {{for over a year}} and considered five options aside from streetcars. One other option, Select Bus Service, was estimated to cost $1 billion to implement, and wasn't chosen as it wouldn't raise property values the way that a streetcar would. The engineers projected 52,000 to 53,000 riders per day on the streetcar, which would have required a bus every minute. Each street car would be able to carry 150 to 175 passengers. Additionally, buses would also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> time navigating the 12 to 15 streets along the route. The engineers' route would have its own dedicated lanes for the whole route. The study recommended that two facilities for maintenance and storage would be built at a cost of $100 million. In addition, the streetcar would need at least 140 employees to operate the streetcars {{and a host of other}} workers, including traffic enforcement agents.|$|E
25|$|No {{correlation}} (positive or negative) {{exists between}} intelligence and shyness. Research indicates that shy children <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> time expressing their knowledge {{in social situations}} (which most modern curricula utilize) and {{because they do not}} engage actively in discussions, teachers view them as less intelligent. In line with social learning theory, an unwillingness to engage with classmates and teachers makes it more difficult for shy students to learn. Test scores, however, indicate that shyness is unrelated to actual academic knowledge, and therefore only academic engagement. Depending on the level of a teacher's own shyness, more indirect (vs. socially oriented) strategies are used with shy individuals to assess knowledge in the classroom, and accommodations are made. Observed peer evaluations of shy people during initial meeting and social interactions thereafter found that peers evaluate shy individuals as less intelligent during the first encounter. During subsequent interactions, however, peers perceived shy individuals' intelligence more positively.|$|E
25|$|During the May 27, 2015 CMLL Informa show it was {{revealed}} that Negro Casas would be the trainer for Blue Panther Jr, Canelo Casas, Delta and Guerrero Maya Jr. while Virus would be the trainer for Zavala, Disturbio, Esfinge and Flyer. Three out of the four wrestlers on Virus' team were already in his wrestling class, adding Disturbio to the group. During the CMLL Informa episode the announcers pushed the storyline that Casas might <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> time with his team, training the son of long time rival Blue Panther, Casas' nephew and the two most experienced wrestlers in the group who may not be as open to his input as a trainer. During the first round Guerrero Maya Jr. earned 100 points from winning five matches in total during the seven-week round-robin tournament, the most of any of the participants while Flyer only earned 30 points for one victory (over Blue Panther Jr.) and a draw against Canelo Casas, the least of any participant. Guerrero Maya Jr. was also the person to get the highest accumulated score from the judges, a total of 221 points, with Delta receiving the lowest collective score a total of 132 points. The online poll had Boby Zavala as the top point earner with 221 points and Blue Panther Jr as the lowest with only 53 points in total. While Flyer scored low both in matches and with the judges the fan polls were strongly in his favor during the last four weeks that it moved him into fifth position. Blue Panther Jr., who was already the lowest ranked competitor, did not work his final match of the first round, with CMLL claiming force majure, replacing him in the match with Hechicero who wrestled against Delta but did not get any points. His no-show did not change his rankings as he could not possibly have ended higher than seventh place. For the last week of the first round it looked as if Flyer would be in third place as long as he got decent points from the judges due to his strong poll numbers, but he was forced {{to pull out of the}} match due to a foot injury. Due to this CMLL had Guerrero Maya Jr. wrestle against Trit√≥n. By not scoring any points from the judges at all Flyer felt to fourth position. In the end Guerrero Maya Jr., Bobby Zavala, Esfinge and Disturbio all qualified for the second round. Between rounds trainer Negro Casas will team up with Guerrero Maya Jr. and Boby Zavala to take on Virus, Esfinge and Disturbio as part of the July 24 Super Viernes show.|$|E

2500|$|A 2010 {{study by}} Catalyst, a nonprofit {{that works to}} expand {{opportunities}} for women in business, {{of male and female}} MBA graduates found that after controlling for career aspirations, parental status, years of experience, industry, and other variables, male graduates {{are more likely to be}} assigned jobs of higher rank and responsibility and earn, on average, $4,600 more than women in their first post-MBA jobs.This affects women‚Äôs ability to pay off student loan debt since college isn‚Äôt cheaper for a woman even though she can expect to make less after she earns a degree than her male peers. This results in women being in disproportionately more debt than men. This extra debt makes having less income even more debilitating as women <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> time paying off student loan debt.|$|E
2500|$|Felony records greatly {{influence}} {{the chances of}} people finding employment. Many employers seem to use criminal history as a screening mechanism without attempting to probe deeper. They are often more interested in incarceration {{as a measure of}} employability and trustworthiness instead of its relation to any specific job. People who have felony records <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> time finding a job. The psychological effects of incarceration can also impede an ex-felon‚Äôs search for employment. Prison can cause social anxiety, distrust, and other psychological issues that negatively affect a person's reintegration into an employment setting. [...] Men who are unemployed are more likely to participate in crime [...] which leads to there being a 67% chance of ex-felons being charged again. In 2008, the difficulties male ex-felons in the United States had finding employment lead to approximately a 1.6% decrease in the employment rate alone. This is a loss of between $57 and $65 billion of output to the US economy.|$|E
2500|$|In 1983, Rey faced one of {{the worst}} {{challenges}} of both his career, and personal life; an impostor was using his name and was committing crimes, among them were car-napping and rape. The list even extended to marrying numerous women, and even petty crimes like [...] "borrowing" [...] money and personal items, all under Rey Valera's name. Rey made numerous newspaper statements announcing that there is an imposter posing as him. Rey also wrote and released a song entitled, [...] "My Fans Are in Trouble" [...] to warn his fans through the medium of music, with the lyrics depicting his helplessness to stop this impostor. What Rey feared most was not the money, but the physical harm people the impostor had fooled might do to him. Ultimately in 1984, Rey decided to quit show business {{at the peak of his}} career to protect his fans and also to make up for the time he lost with his family during his fame. When Rey made a comeback in 1988, he wore his hair long so that his impostor (who had kinky hair), would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> time posing as him if the impostor ever resurfaced. The impostor has never been heard from ever since.|$|E
