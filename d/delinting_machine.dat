The system hardware is comprised of three torque sensor, master controller, data acquisition and regulation module, displacement transducer, linear actuator and variable frequency device. The operating parameters such as the rotation torque and speed of every delinting cylinder and outlet opening are obtained on line by the apparatus and then sent to the master controller. With the help of LabWindow/CVI, the master controller program is developed to get {{and deal with the}} information. Since the feed rate and discharge rate directly affect the working load of the cylinders, the speed of feeding motor and outlet opening can be manually regulated by means of the program to facilitate the working load test experiment. In order to achieve the optimization load allocation of the delinting cylinder, the optimal decision is {{made on the basis of}} the third cylinder’s working load to regulate the outlet opening. The experiment results show that the outlet opening regulation accuracy reaches ± 1 mm. This system is also easy to use and provide a good graphical user interface and has higher accuracy, higher efficiency for the real-time control...|$|E
