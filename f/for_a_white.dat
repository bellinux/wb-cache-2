5|$|S.e.caesia, {{the most}} {{widespread}} of the western subspecies, has orange-buff underparts except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> throat and cheeks. The other western forms mainly differ in the exact shade of the underparts, although some southeastern forms also show a white forehead and supercilium. S.e.sinensis and S.e.formosana, of China and Taiwan respectively, have buff underparts like the western races, but have buff, instead of white, throats.|$|E
5|$|A {{white dwarf}} is very hot when it forms, {{but because it}} has no source of energy, it will {{gradually}} radiate its energy and cool. This means that its radiation, which initially has a high color temperature, will lessen and redden with time. Over a very long time, a white dwarf will cool and its material will begin to crystallize (starting with the core). The star's low temperature means it will no longer emit significant heat or light, and {{it will become a}} cold black dwarf. Because the length of time it takes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years), it is thought that no black dwarfs yet exist. The oldest white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand kelvins.|$|E
5|$|Real Madrid has {{maintained}} the white shirt for its home kit {{throughout the history}} of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Escobal and Quesada in 1925; the two were traveling through England when they noticed the kit worn by London-based team Corinthian F.C., {{one of the most famous}} teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship. It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck. By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts. English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.|$|E

5|$|The {{occupation}} of Czechoslovakia by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany in March 1939 convinced Huggins that war was imminent. Seeking to renew his government's mandate to pass emergency measures, he called an early election {{in which his}} United Party won an increased majority. Huggins rearranged his Cabinet on a war footing, making the Minister of Justice Robert Tredgold Minister of Defence as well. The territory proposed forces not only for internal security {{but also for the}} defence of British interests overseas. Self-contained Rhodesian formations were planned, including a mechanised reconnaissance unit, but Tredgold opposed this. Remembering the catastrophic casualties suffered by units such as the Newfoundland Regiment and the South African Brigade on the Western Front in World War I, he argued that one or two heavy defeats <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> Southern Rhodesian brigade might cause crippling losses and have irrevocable effects on the country as a whole. He proposed to instead concentrate on training white Rhodesians for leadership roles and specialist units, and to disperse the colony's men across the forces in small groups. These ideas met with approval in both Salisbury and London and were adopted.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins are as long {{or longer}} than the head, with a nearly straight front margin and broad tips. The first dorsal fin is large with a rounded apex, and is placed behind the pectoral fins. The second dorsal and anal fins are tiny. The caudal peduncle is expanded laterally into strong keels. The caudal fin is crescent-shaped, with a small notch near {{the tip of the}} upper lobe. The dermal denticles are elliptical, longer than wide, with three to seven horizontal ridges leading to a toothed posterior margin. The coloration is dark blue to grayish black above and white below. The unpaired fins are dark except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> rear margin on the anal fin; the pectoral and pelvic fins are dark above and white below with sharp gray posterior margins. In adults and large juveniles, the area beneath the snout, around the jaw, and the origin of the pectoral fins have dusky mottling.|$|E

Currently, several hundred white tigers are in captivity worldwide, with about one hundred being found in India.

25|$|Throughout the ransoming process, the Cázares {{were allowed}} to talk with their {{remaining}} relatives in three occasions. In their first phone conversation, the victims talked about their concern for their wives and children. Their second conversation was a lot shorter and emotive for the Cázares, however. By July 27, the kidnappers said they needed a final cash deliver in order to release them. The Cázares sent the money to Matamoros from Texas and eagerly awaited at a disclosed location <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> van {{that was supposed to}} deliver their relatives. The van never came and the phone line that the family used to contact the kidnappers was out of service. Weeks after that, the family decided to contact law enforcement.|$|E

25|$|The {{horse was}} a direct {{influence}} on much later hill figures of white horses, including Kilburn White Horse (1858) in Yorkshire and Folkestone White Horse (2003) in Kent, {{in addition to the}} white horse cut from heather that existed from 1981 until the mid-1990s in Mossley, Greater Manchester. The first Westbury White Horse, which faced left, is believed to also be inspired by the Uffington horse. Uffington White Horse has also inspired lookalike hill figures, including one facing left in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. Direct replicas of the Uffington horse can be found at Cockington Green Gardens in Australia and Hogansville, Georgia, USA. Uffington White Horse has also inspired two sculptures in Wiltshire, namely Julie Livsey's White Horse Pacified (1987) in the nearby Swindon, a town which was also once considered <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> horse, and Charlotte Moreton's White Horse (2010) in Solstice Park, Amesbury.|$|E
25|$|On July 9, 2011, alleged gunmen of the Gulf Cartel kidnapped 18 {{members of}} the Cázares family from three {{different}} households in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico. The children and women were eventually released three days later, but the abductors kept five men. Forty-eight hours later, the Gulf Cartel contacted the members who had been released to start negotiating ransom. After several days of negotiation and several ransom payments totaling US$100,000, the Cázares were called to deliver their final payment on July 27. They sent {{the money to the}} kidnappers and waited in a disclosed location <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> van the kidnappers had pledged to deliver their remaining family members. However, the van never arrived and the phone the kidnappers used to contact the Cázares went out of service. The family then decided to contact authorities and open the case. The Cázares men have been missing ever since.|$|E
25|$|More {{controversial}} was {{the proposal}} for an “understanding” clause requiring each applicant to demonstrate {{an understanding of}} the Constitution to a county registrar. Alfred P. Thom, a railroad lawyer from Norfolk, explained “I would not expect an impartial administration of the clause.” There would be no “friendship by the white man to the suffrage of the black man”, but on the other hand, Thom did not expect a rigid examination <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> man, “this clause will not exclude any worthy white citizen of this Commonwealth from the suffrage…he will find a friendly examiner.” Robert William Blair of Southwest Wythe County objected to the provisions proposed by Carter Glass which were the same methods used to bring disenfranchisement other Southern states. The understanding clause would give too much power to the “caprice and corruption of a dishonest election officer.” In western Virginia, hundreds would be unable to meet the new requirements, without enough property, unable to pay the poll tax for three consecutive years, or who would fail the registrar’s examination on Constitutional understanding.|$|E
