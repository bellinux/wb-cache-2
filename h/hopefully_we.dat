500|$|Due to its low budget, Becoming Jane {{was filmed}} on a [...] "tight" [...] {{schedule}} of eight weeks from March to May 2006. Jarrold observed however that because Ecosse {{was not a}} film studio, he had more creative freedom. Bernstein stated of filming, [...] "We recreated a world that Jane Austen lovers can recognise and associate with. But <b>hopefully</b> <b>we</b> can also take them into areas and places like the boxing club, the cricket game and the fair that do not feature in Jane Austen's fiction. They are sort of seedy and dangerous areas that are not normally associated with Austen." [...] Jarrold found filming [...] "very difficult.

Michael Schumacher admitted to feeling disappointed after the race, having led the majority of the race until his lap 56 retirement.

500|$|Chris Stamp {{designed}} {{the cover of}} the UK version of Are You Experienced, which featured a picture of Hendrix, Mitchell, and Redding by Bruce Fleming. The image shows Hendrix wearing a long dark cape while standing over Mitchell and Redding, striking what Egan described as a [...] "Dracula-esque pose". Chandler contacted Fleming based on the photographer's previous work with the Hollies, the Dave Clark Five, and the Animals. The photo shoot took place in February after Fleming had attended several recording sessions and Experience gigs. Chandler made a point of requesting that the band member's faces be clearly visible in the photograph; Fleming explained: [...] " [...] got much more esoteric as time went on, but to establish the artist we had to get their faces across so the kids would recognize them." [...] He took monochrome and color shots of the band; Track selected an image from the latter group. Fleming had indicated which picture he preferred they use, marking the shot with a cross, but after the album's release he realized that they had selected another, less desirable image. According to Fleming, the shot that he chose was [...] "more sinister; more interesting". Stamp hired graphic artist Alan Aldridge to design the sleeve's psychedelic lettering. Track inexplicably put only the album's title on the cover, omitting the band's name; Polydor issued the release throughout Europe with Hendrix's name printed at the top in matching font. The cover art's combination of dull green and brown tones, juxtaposed with the jocular nature of the subject's pose, created a weak overall visual impression; Stamp commented: [...] "It's not a great cover at all. <b>Hopefully,</b> <b>we</b> made up for that in all the other covers." ...|$|E
