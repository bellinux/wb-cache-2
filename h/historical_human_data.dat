40|$|The NASA Occupant Protection Group {{is charged}} with {{ensuring}} crewmembers are protected during all dynamic phases of spaceflight. Previous work with outside experts {{has led to the}} development of a definition of acceptable risk (DAR) for space capsule vehicles. The DAR defines allowable probability rates for various categories of injuries. An important question is how to validate these probabilities for a given vehicle. One approach is to impact test human volunteers under projected nominal landing loads. The main drawback is the large number of subject tests required to attain a reasonable level of confidence that the injury probability rates would meet those outlined in the DAR. An alternative is to mine existing databases containing human responses to impact. Testing an anthropomorphic test device (ATD) at the same humanexposure levels could yield a range of ATD responses that would meet DAR. As one aspect of future vehicle validation, the ATD could be tested in the vehicle's seat and suit configuration at nominal landing loads and compared with the ATD responses supported by the human data set. This approach could reduce the number of humanvolunteer tests NASA would need to conduct to validate that a vehicle meets occupant protection standards. METHODS: The U. S. Air Force has recorded hundreds of human responses to frontal, lateral, and spinal impacts at many acceleration levels and pulse durations. All of this data are stored on the Collaborative Biomechanics Data Network (CBDN), which is maintained by the Wright Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB). The test device for human occupant restraint (THOR) ATD was impact tested on WPAFB's horizontal impulse accelerator (HIA) matching humanvolunteer exposures on the HIA to 5 frontal and 3 spinal loading conditions. No human injuries occurred as a result of these impact conditions. Peak THOR response variables for neck axial tension and compression, and thoracicspine axial compression were collected. Maximal chest deflection was determined from motion capture video of the impact test. HIC 15 and BRIC were calculated from head acceleration responses. Given the number of human subjects for each test condition a confidence interval of injury probability will be obtained. RESULTS: Results will be discussed in terms of injuryrisk probability estimates based on the human data set evaluated. Also, gaps in the data set will be identified. These gaps could be one of two types. One is areas where additional THOR testing would increase the comparable human data set, thereby improving confidence in the injury probability rate. The other is where additional human testing would assist in obtaining information on other acceleration levels or directions. DISCUSSION: The <b>historical</b> <b>human</b> <b>data</b> showed validity of the THOR ATD for supplemental testing. The <b>historical</b> <b>human</b> <b>data</b> are limited in scope, however. Further data are needed to characterize the effects of sex, age, anthropometry, and deconditioning due to spaceflight on risk of injur...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The ergodic theorems of {{demography}} {{describe the}} properties of a product of certain nonnegative matrices, in the limit {{as the number of}} matrix factors in the product becomes large. This paper reviews these theorems and, where possible, their empirical usefulness. The strong ergodic theorem of demography assumes fixed age-specific birth and death rates. An approach to a stable age structure and to an exponentially changing total population size, predicted by the Perron-Frobenius theorem, is observed in at least some human populations. The weak ergodic theorem of demography assumes a deterministic sequence of changing birth and death rates, and predicts that two populations with initially different age structures will have age structures which differ by less and less. Strong and weak stochastic ergodic theorems assume that the birth and death rates are chosen by time-homogeneous or time-inhomogeneous Markov chains and describe the probability distribution of age structure and measures of the growth of total population size. These stochastic models and theorems suggest a scheme for incorporating <b>historical</b> <b>human</b> <b>data</b> into a new method of population projection. The empirical merit of this scheme in competition with existing methods of projection remains to be determined. Most analytical results developed for products of random matrices in demography apply to a variety of other fields where products of random matrices are a useful model. 1. Introduction.

40|$|A scientific, {{economic}} {{relationship among}} self, society and nation {{is still not}} clearly known in philosophy, sociology and economics {{because of lack of}} concrete <b>historical</b> <b>human</b> <b>data</b> that would enable to substantiate it. Humanity experienced many conflicting economic and political systems. Consequently, philosophers, sociologists and economists have been investigating to study the economic relationship among self, society and nation that may lead to a desirable economic system for individual and social prosperity. The author presented a desirable ideology of “communal freedom democracy” based on his theory of the science of self, society and nation that is derived from the perspective of his theory of the science of self, mind and body. In this study, the ideology of “communal freedom democracy” is compared with other theories related socio-economic systems: Ringmar’s “surviving capitalism”, Marx’s communism, Acemoglu and Robinson’ seconomic and political theory, teachings related to economics in Confucianism and Islam, Yunus’s “social business” of micro-credit and “creating shared value” of Porter and Kramer. There is a considerable agreement between the ideology of “communal freedom democracy” and Ringmar’s “surviving capitalism”, Acemoglu and Robinson’ seconomic and political theory, teachings related to economics in Confucianism and Islam, Yunus’s social business theory or “creating shared value” of Porter and Kramer. The “communal freedom democracy” seems to be a desirable economic and political institution that would contribute to achieve individual and social prosperity, and further harmony and peace in the society and nation...|$|E

Precise measures of antigenic distance between the vaccine and circulating virus strains help researchers design influenza vaccines with high vaccine effectiveness. We here introduce a sequence-based method to predict vaccine effectiveness in <b>humans.</b> <b>Historical</b> epidemiological <b>data</b> show that this sequence-based method is as predictive of vaccine effectiveness as hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay data from ferret animal model studies.

The evolution rate of hemagglutinin in H 1 N 1 is also shown to be greater than that in H 3 N 2, presumably due to greater immune selection pressure.

40|$|An {{increase}} in the world population has accelerated the consumption of fossil fuels and deepened the pollution of global environment. As {{a result of these}} human activities, it is now difficult to clearly guarantee the sustainable future of humankind. An intuitional 'must-go path' scenario for the sustainable development of human civilization is proposed by extrapolating the <b>human</b> <b>historical</b> <b>data</b> over 30 years between 1970 and 2000. One of the most important parameters in order to realize the 'must-go path' scenario is the sustainability of energy without further pollution. In some countries an expanded use of nuclear energy is advantageous to increase sustainability, but fast reactor technology and closed fuel cycle have to be introduced to make it sustainable. In other countries, the development of cost-effective renewable energy, and the clean use of coal and oil are urgently needed to reduce pollution. The effect of fast nuclear reactor technology on sustainability as an option for near-term energy source is detailed in this paper. More cooperation between countries and worldwide collaboration coordinated by international organizations are essential to make the 'must-go path' scenario real in the upcoming 20 or 30 years.

40|$|Small {{islands are}} widely {{agreed to be}} {{vulnerable}} to human-induced sea-level rise during the 21 st century and beyond, with forced abandonment of some low-lying oceanic islands being a real possibility. A regional abandonment of islands in the Chesapeake Bay, USA provides an historical analog of such vulnerability as this {{has been linked to}} a mid 19 th Century acceleration in relative sea-level rise. Using a case study approach for Holland Island, Maryland, this hypothesis was tested using a range of physical and <b>human</b> <b>historical</b> <b>data.</b> While sea-level rise was the underlying driver, this analysis shows that the abandonment was more complex than a direct response to sea-level rise. Between 1850 and 1900, Holland Island was a booming community and population increased from 37 to 253, with immigration causing the majority of the increase. At the same time, the upland area where people made their homes was steadily diminishing, losing about 15 ha or 38 % of the total. After 1900, the island experienced a decrease in population to 169 in 1916, with final abandonment in 1918, {{with the exception of one}} family who left by 1920. Final abandonment was triggered by this depopulation as the population fell below a level that could support critical community services, and the community lost faith in their future on Holland Island. It is likely that similar social processes determined the abandonment of the other Chesapeake Bay islands. Looking to the future, it shows that many small low-lying islands could be abandoned due to sea-level rise long before they become physically uninhabitable...|$|R
50|$|The Faroese {{house mouse}} was {{probably}} introduced accidentally from Britain by the Irish monks {{as early as}} the 6th century. It is the Western European house mouse (Mus domesticus) but has earlier been labelled as Mus musculus. This naming has also been used to name the sub-species which has evolved in the isolated island populations. The Nólsoy house mouse is a sub-species called (Mus musculus faroeensis) and the Mykines house mouse is also a sub-species called (Mus musculus mykinessiensis). However, a recent study, based on DNA-analyses, has shown that mice on the most remote islands (Hesti, Fugloy, Mykines and Nólsoy) are characterized as M. m. domesticus, whereas the mice on the better connected islands (Sandoy and in Torshavn) are mixed and have both M. m. musculus and M. m. domesticus genetic elements. Furthermore, the investigation indicated {{that the majority of the}} mice have their origins in south-western Norway, in agreement with <b>human</b> <b>historical</b> <b>data,</b> while the mice on the island of Sandoy may have arrived from the British Isles or from Denmark. The M. m. musculus genetic component appears to derive from recent immigrant mice from Denmark. The wood mouse or field mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) was recorded on the Faroe Islands in the 17th century, but has not been recorded since. These recordings might have been mistaken. The house mouse is present on the islands Mykines, Streymoy, Fugloy, Hestur, Nólsoy and Sandoy. From time to time they have been located on Eysturoy, but they have never managed to establish themselves there due to the presence of the brown rat.|$|R
