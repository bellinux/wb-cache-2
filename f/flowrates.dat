The 2012 flow of 600,000 bbd is significantly less than what the pipeline was designed for. Low <b>flowrates</b> require that the oil move slower through the line, meaning that its temperature drops more than in high-flow situations.

This report noted that these improvements could bring flow as low as 350,000 bbd, but it did not attempt to determine the absolute minimum. Other studies have suggested that the minimum is 70,000 100,000 bbd with the current pipeline.

40|$|The {{gravity flow}} of bulk solids from mass flow bins and hoppers {{is a subject}} of {{considerable}} practical and theoretical interest Many published papers have brought {{greater understanding of the}} <b>flowrate</b> of coarse particles. Research on finer materials was insufficient due to imprecise predictions of the air pressure gradient at the hopper outlet, which is a very important factor in predicting the <b>flowrate</b> of the fine particles. The work in this thesis develops theoretical models for predicting the interstitial air pressure gradient and for predicting the <b>flowrate</b> of bulk solids from conical mass flow bins. The theoretical models are based on the continuum mechanics theory. The boundary conditions follow air pressure and bulk density continuity in a vertical direction. A close agreement between theoretical results and experimental results was obtained for predicting both <b>flowrate</b> and air pressure distribution. Both theoretical and experimental results indicate that the <b>flowrate</b> of free flowing bulk solids increases rapidly at first and then more gradually as the particle permeability constant increases. The use of 2 ̆ 7 permeability 2 ̆ 7 enables the theories developed to be applied in describing the flow behaviour of both coarse and fine particle mixtures as well as composite particle size-distributed bulk solids. The use of consolidation-related bulk density and permeability enables the theoretical models to be applied to both compressible and incompressible materials. Results of both theoretical and experimental work on the effect of material surcharge level on the <b>flowrate</b> indicate that for fine materials this effect is significant. Based on the original theoretical model, simplified expressions for predicting the dynamic deaeration coefficient Kdea and a simplified <b>flowrate</b> model are presented.

The increase of moisture content lowered the reaction rates in the range of 230 - 30000 ppmv. The reaction rate of 6 mu M TCE increased as the light intensity increased, and was proportional to the 0. 61 order of the light intensity.

40|$|This paper {{explains}} the procedure {{used to determine}} the amount of air leakage being generated from the use of a drop-through rotary valve in a full-scale pneumatic conveying system. When producing a set ofpneumatic conveying characteristics for a test program, rotary valve air leakage is often not considered. In reality, the air mass <b>flowrate</b> in the conveying line will be less than the total supplied air mass <b>flowrate</b> due to air leakage through the rotary valve. By measuring the air leakage and adjusting the total supplied air mass <b>flowrate</b> to represent the actual air mass <b>flowrate</b> travelling through the conveying line, a more accurate representation of the conveying conditions can be obtained. Hence the design of pneumatic conveying systems can be determined more precisely. Tests have been performed and plots have been produced showing both the pneumatic conveying characteristics before and after rotary valve air leakage has been taken into account. These results show that rotary valve air leakage can have quite an effect, with some tests losing more than 50010 ofthe supplied air mass <b>flowrate</b> through the rotary valve...|$|R

50|$|As earlier stated, flow {{instruments}} that function with the separator in an {{oil and gas}} environment include the flow indicator, flow transmitter and the flow controller. Due to maintenance (which will be discussed later) or due to high usage, these flowmeters do need to be calibrated from time to time. Calibration {{can be defined as}} the process of referencing signals of known quantity that has been predetermined to suit the range of measurements required. Calibration can also be seen from a mathematical point of view in which the flowmeters are standardized by determining the deviation from the predetermined standard so as to ascertain the proper correction factors. In determining the deviation from the predetermined standard, the actual flowrate is usually first determined {{with the use of a}} master meter which is a type of flowmeter that has been calibrated with a high degree of accuracy or by weighing the flow so as to be able to obtain a gravimetric reading of the mass flow. Another type of meter used is the transfer meter. However, according to Ting et al (1989), transfer meters have been proven to be less accurate if the operating conditions are different from its original calibrated points. According to Yoder (2000), the types of flowmeters used as master meters include turbine meters, positive displacement meters, venturi meters, and Coriolis meters. In the U.S., master meters are often calibrated at a flow lab that has been certified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, (NIST). NIST certification of a flowmeter lab means that its methods have been approved by NIST. Normally, this includes NIST traceability, meaning that the standards used in the flowmeter calibration process have been certified by NIST or are causally linked back to standards that have been approved by NIST. However, there is a general belief in the industry that the second method which involves the gravimetric weighing of the amount of fluid (liquid or gas) that actually flows through the meter into or out of a container during the calibration procedure is the most ideal method for measuring the actual amount of flow. Apparently, the weighing scale used for this method also has to be traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as well.In ascertaining a proper correction factor, there is often no simple hardware adjustment to make the flowmeter start reading correctly. Instead, the deviation from the correct reading is recorded at a variety of <b>flowrates.</b> The data points are plotted, comparing the flowmeter output to the actual flowrate as determined by the standardized National Institute of Standards and Technology master meter or weigh scale.|$|E

The average droplet diameter is found to scale with Weber number and density ratio. Breakup phenomena are captured and described for various combinations of water and air <b>flowrates,</b> which indicate the significant role the air jet plays in promoting water jets atomization. Quantitative measurements using phase Doppler anemometry (PDA) reveals the effects of water <b>flowrates</b> on the generated droplets’ size, velocity and root mean square (RMS) distributions and air mass <b>flowrates</b> on the droplets’ size distribution along the vertical axis.
