Among the more radical interpretations is Glen Tetley's 1974 version, in which the Chosen One is a young male.

Most surprising was the approval <b>from</b> <b>Michael</b> Grade, who had previously forced an 18-month hiatus on the show in 1985, and had postponed Doctor Who out of personal dislike on several occasions. The show's popularity ultimately led to a resurgence in family-oriented Saturday night drama.|$|E
