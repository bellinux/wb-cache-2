5|$|Cinderella State, <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> feeling indignant. That was {{the reason}} for the Secession. Because they had ignored his poor Cinderella State, all one million square miles of it.|$|E
5|$|Eiji, {{one of the}} game's designers, {{commented that}} <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> K' would be more popular than {{he turned out to}} be, noting that K' was too plain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then ’e remembered Sam and Peter, {{and when}} <b>’e</b> <b>thought</b> of them {{safe and sound}} aboard the Penguin he nearly broke down altogether, as <b>’e</b> <b>thought</b> how lonesome <b>he</b> was.|$|R
60|$|WINSOR. Of course, he'll bring a case, when <b>he's</b> <b>thought</b> it over.|$|R
60|$|Captain Davenport gave a start. <b>He</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had {{the ship}} to himself.|$|R
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> men's {{eminence}} {{over women}} was {{the outcome of}} sexual selection, a view disputed by Antoinette Brown Blackwell in The Sexes Throughout Nature.|$|E
5|$|Konteradmiral Miklós Horthy, {{commander}} of the proposed attack, cancelled the attack because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that the Italians had discovered his plan and ordered the ships to return to Pola.|$|E
5|$|Shaw {{had long}} {{supported}} {{the principle of}} Irish Home Rule within the British Empire (which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> should become the British Commonwealth).|$|E
6000|$|... 'When Dean came,' said Claggett, 'the people <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was {{an escaped}} lunatic; but when <b>he</b> went, they <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was an escaped archangel.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An idiot of idiots." [...] For a moment, on it all, on {{the stupid}} doom in it, {{they looked at}} each other. [...] "Yet <b>he's</b> <b>thought</b> so awfully clever." ...|$|R
60|$|Ned looked uncommonly knowing at this point, and {{admitted}} that <b>he</b> rather <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> could--a dozen of them, if necessary.|$|R
5|$|The Cowboys {{were about}} a block {{and a half}} from the West End Corral at 2nd Street and Fremont, where Ike and Tom's wagon and team were stabled. Virgil Earp later testified that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> Ike and Tom were stabled at the O.K. Corral on Allen between 3rd and 4th, from which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> they would be departing if they were leaving town.|$|E
5|$|Blacklist {{graphics}} {{and lack of}} difficulty were criticized. McCaffrey found the visuals unimpressive and most character models to be ugly; he also noted technical problems, such as screen-tearing and frame rate issues. Bloodworth criticized the game's invisible wall and unresponsive controls in certain segments, although <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> those minor issues did not drag down its overall experience. McCaffrey noted that even when {{the game is played}} in perfectionist mode, it is less challenging than its predecessors. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> Blacklist gave players too many rewards, making its universal-economy system a useless feature. Bloodworth was puzzled by the game's unlock system, which he said hindered its credibility.|$|E
5|$|Bolton manager Sam Allardyce, who was {{building}} a reputation for signing unwanted foreign veterans such as N'Gotty, Djorkaeff and Iván Campo, predicted that a win would help him sign more players in the summer. However, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that success would also lead his 13 players who {{would be out of}} contract, to demand more money for a renewal.|$|E
60|$|He {{walked on}} very thoughtful, {{and the more}} <b>'e</b> <b>thought,</b> the less <b>'e</b> liked it. He was so pale that Ginger <b>thought</b> <b>'e</b> was ill and advised 'im to 'ave a drop o' brandy. Peter {{recommended}} rum, so to please 'em he 'ad both. It brought 'is colour back, but not 'is cheerfulness.|$|R
60|$|Henery Walker {{was going}} to say {{something}} bad, but <b>'e</b> <b>thought</b> better of it, and he lay there arf busting with rage, and watching Bob {{out of the corner of}} one eye.|$|R

5|$|Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted {{early in}} the oral {{argument}} that the case presented two questions. First, whether the Ninth Circuit's ruling was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. Second, whether the state courts' ruling was objectively unreasonable according to AEDPA. California Deputy Attorney General Deborah Chuang argued that the Ninth Circuit's ruling was not consistent with precedent because the Supreme Court had never addressed using age {{as a factor in}} custody analysis. Associate Justice Stephen Breyer remarked that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> a Supreme Court precedent was not necessary because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it obvious that age affects whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave. John P. Elwood, at the time assistant to the Solicitor General, argued that age doesn't make a legal difference for Miranda purposes because it is a rule uniformly applied to all people and that police officers should not be required to get inside the head of each suspect.|$|E
5|$|Damien Leith {{was also}} {{conscious}} of the lyrics we wrote. He added a few emotional ballads which contained strong lyrics, but had left out the songs <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> were too depressing.|$|E
5|$|District Attorney Jim Garrison subpoenaed Altgens {{to appear}} in New Orleans, Louisiana for the 1969 trial of {{businessman}} Clay Shaw on charges of conspiring to kill Kennedy. A check for US$300 was sent to cover the airfare, but Altgens {{did not want to}} go; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> Garrison was acting in his own self-interest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle Dick {{started and}} turned pale. Fust 'e {{seemed as if}} 'e was going to speak, and then <b>'e</b> <b>thought</b> better of it. He sat staring at 'Arry as if 'e couldn't believe his eyes.|$|R

5|$|Education in Zimbabwe became {{under threat}} since the {{economic}} changes in 2000 with teachers going on strike {{because of low}} pay, students unable to concentrate because of hunger {{and the price of}} uniforms soaring making this standard a luxury. Teachers were also one of the main targets of Mugabe's attacks because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> they were not strong supporters.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{producer}} Akitoshi Kawazu {{was pleased}} by Famitsus rating but admitted that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{the game was}} not perfect; {{he felt that the}} storyline did not meet some fans' expectations. Kawazu expressed his frustration and regrets regarding the storyline, citing creative differences between the PlayOnline and Final Fantasy Tactics members of the development team.|$|E
5|$|He {{assumed the}} worst in people and he brought out {{the worst in}} them... He clung {{to the idea of}} being 'tough'. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> that was what had brought him to the edge of greatness. But that was what betrayed him. He could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness.|$|E

60|$|Bob Pretty pointed with 'is finger {{exactly where}} <b>'e</b> <b>thought</b> it was, but they wouldn't listen to 'im, and then Lewis, arter twice saying wot a bad cold he'd got, took 'is coat off very slow and careful.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> never <b>thought</b> {{that she}} saw in him what {{no one else could}} see. <b>He</b> never <b>thought</b> that in the whole world there were no other eyes that looked upon him with the same light and {{strength}} as hers.|$|R
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> {{its closest}} {{relative}} was clearly Banksia serrata and then B.ornata, {{and that the}} three formed a link with western species. Since Brown's original publication had treated all of Fraser's specimens as syntypes (shared type specimens) for the species, George also chose a lectotype (a single specimen {{to serve as the}} type specimen).|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> {{its closest}} {{relatives}} to be Banksia speciosa and B.baxteri, {{and that it}} also formed a link with eastern species, particularly Banksia serrata. Since Brown's original publication had treated all of Fraser's specimens as syntypes for the species, George also chose a lectotype, selecting a tree that Fraser had received from Macleay in May 1828.|$|E
5|$|He was {{not only}} {{concerned}} with higher education, but also with primary education, and promoted the creation of free schools for poor children. In those schools, students would learn to read and learn basic maths and the catechism. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> that this would help to raise people willing to work, and reduce laziness.|$|E
