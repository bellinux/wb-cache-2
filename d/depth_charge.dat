5|$|Assigned to the Atlantic Transport Service, Orizaba {{carried over}} 15,000troops in six convoy trips to France {{before the end}} of World War I. In one such voyage, Orizaba’s {{executive}} officer, ordnance expert William Price Williamson, worked closely with Commander Richard Drace White—Orizaba’s commanding officer, himself an ordnance expert—to develop a workable <b>depth</b> <b>charge</b> launcher which would provide the transport with a measure of protection from enemy submarines. Williamson set about modifying a Lyle gun into a <b>depth</b> <b>charge</b> launcher, and successfully tested it on 16 August 1918. While attempting another test with an increased propellant charge the following day, a defective fuse exploded the <b>depth</b> <b>charge</b> prematurely, killing Williamson and three other sailors. White, four other officers, and twenty-two enlisted men were also wounded in the blast.|$|E
5|$|Many Canadian {{naval ships}} of World War II adopted an {{unofficial}} coat of arms, and Fredericton was no exception. Her badge, which was {{displayed on the}} front of the bridge, was a flying tiger dropping a <b>depth</b> <b>charge</b> on a U-boat.|$|E
5|$|Rear Admiral Rafael Celestino Benítez was a Lieutenant Commander who saw action aboard {{submarines}} and {{on various}} occasions weathered <b>depth</b> <b>charge</b> attacks. For his actions, {{he was awarded}} the Silver and Bronze Star Medals.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Depth</b> <b>Charges,</b> {{the most}} used weapon, were {{improved}} {{during the course}} of the war. Starting with WW1 vintage 300 lb <b>depth</b> <b>charges,</b> a 600 lb version was developed. Torpex explosive, which is a 50% more powerful explosive than TNT, was introduced in 1943. Y-guns and K-guns were used to throw <b>depth</b> <b>charges</b> to the side of the escort vessel, augmenting the charges rolled off the stern and letting the escort vessel lay a pattern of <b>depth</b> <b>charges</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The {{first to}} deploy <b>depth</b> <b>charges</b> from {{airplanes}} in actual combat were the Finns. Experiencing {{the same problems}} as the RAF with insufficient charges on anti-submarine bombs, Captain Birger Ek of Finnish Air Force squadron LeLv 6 contacted one of his navy friends and suggested testing the aerial use of standard Finnish Navy <b>depth</b> <b>charges.</b> The tests proved successful, and the Tupolev SB bombers of LeLv 6 were modified in early 1942 to carry <b>depth</b> <b>charges.</b> The success of the anti-submarine missions reached RAF Coastal Command, which promptly began modifying <b>depth</b> <b>charges</b> for aerial use.|$|R
50|$|At about 02:10 on 23 December, {{an enemy}} {{destroyer}} sighted Saury. The submarine went to 120 ft. By 02:16, three <b>depth</b> <b>charges</b> had exploded within 200 yd. Two more <b>depth</b> <b>charges</b> followed, but Saury escaped {{and continued to}} hunt for targets. Early afternoon brought more <b>depth</b> <b>charging,</b> but Saury was not damaged. On 24 December, she sighted a transport, running fast and very close in shore. The submarine was unable to close and attack.|$|R
5|$|Hichens {{lost the}} first boat {{under his command}} during the night action 2/3 October 1942. Engaging four {{trawlers}} MGB 78 went in for a <b>depth</b> <b>charge</b> attack and was lost to enemy fire. Another boat, MGB 76, was lost during the night of 5/6 October 1942, when the flotilla was ambushed by two German torpedo boats {{and a number of}} E boats.|$|E
5|$|Twin <b>depth</b> <b>charge</b> tunnels {{were built}} into the rear hull of the Mogador-class ships. Each tunnel housed eight Guirard depth charges, with another sixteen stowed in the rear magazine. They were {{launched}} by remote control in patterns of four using a chain system. Since no sonar equipment was fitted these depth charges were unlikely to actually damage a submarine.|$|E
5|$|Eight 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes were {{fitted in}} two QR Mk VII quadruple mounts {{to the deck}} below the {{platform}} for the 4-inch guns. Only eight Mark 9 torpedoes were carried. Sydney was fitted with a single <b>depth</b> <b>charge</b> rail at the stern, which held five Mk VII depth charges. Four 3-pounder (47-mm, 1.9-in) quick-firing Hotchkiss guns were carried as saluting guns. These were removed during the August 1940 refit.|$|E
50|$|He {{was awarded}} the Navy Cross on 13 December 1941 during World War II, while serving aboard , after making contact with two Japanese destroyers, and bravely began a {{submerged}} attack; the destroyers detected her, dropping a couple of <b>depth</b> <b>charges,</b> while Sailfish fired two torpedoes. Despite a large explosion nearby, no damage was done, and the destroyers counterattacked with 18-20 <b>depth</b> <b>charges.</b> The <b>depth</b> <b>charging</b> led Mumma to suffer a breakdown and he was relieved.|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} weapons bay could {{accommodate a}} homing torpedo or <b>depth</b> <b>charges,</b> and underwing stores pylons could carry bombs, <b>depth</b> <b>charges,</b> rockets, or missiles. Typical underwing stores included 68 mm (2.68 in) rocket pods or AS.12 wire-guided antiship missiles.|$|R
50|$|On 19 August 1943, 40 mi SE off Noumea the I-17s Glen {{floatplane}} reconnoitered {{and spotted}} a convoy {{that has just}} cleared the harbour. After stowing the plane, I-17 set out after the convoy. The New Zealand armed trawler , escorting the convoy, picked up a submarine contact. She made an initial run over it without using <b>depth</b> <b>charges,</b> a second run dropping two <b>depth</b> <b>charges,</b> and a third run throwing another two <b>depth</b> <b>charges.</b> Then Tui lost contact with I-17.|$|R
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} attack, Noma sped off to <b>depth</b> <b>charge</b> the {{submarine}} while sending an SOS for West Bridge, since the initial explosion destroyed the cargo ship's wireless. Destroyer Burrows arrived {{to take on}} West Bridges survivors, who had situated themselves about a mile (2km) from the still-floating West Bridge. After boarding the destroyer, a head count revealed that four men were missing, but it also turned up two female stowaways.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was capable of}} performing dive bombing, and could be fitted with a single bomb or <b>depth</b> <b>charge</b> on a hardpoint under each wing for the mission, or for anti-submarine warfare. Gun armament consisted of two M2 Browning machine guns, one mounted in a fixed position firing forwards through the propeller using synchronizer gear, while the other was in a flexible position in the observer's cockpit for rear defense.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} changes undergone by {{the ship}} {{during the war}} are not entirely clear. Photographic evidence shows that four Oerlikon 20 mm AA guns were added, one pair to her searchlight platform and the other pair on the bridge wings, although Ottawa retained her 2-pounder guns even after the Oerlikons were added. 'Y' gun was also removed to allow her <b>depth</b> <b>charge</b> stowage to be increased to at least 60 depth charges.|$|E
50|$|<b>Depth</b> <b>Charges</b> are weapons {{used against}} {{submarines}} and underwater mines. The user must first adjust at what <b>depth</b> the <b>charges</b> will detonate before launching them.|$|R
50|$|For {{extraordinary}} heroism in {{the presence}} of the enemy on the occasion of the torpedoing of the Cassin, on 15 October 1917. While the Cassin was searching for the submarine, Ingram sighted the torpedo coming, and realizing that it might strike the ship aft in the vicinity of the <b>depth</b> <b>charges,</b> ran aft with the intention of releasing the <b>depth</b> <b>charges</b> before the torpedo could reach the Cassin. The torpedo struck the ship before he could accomplish his purpose and Ingram was killed by the explosion. The <b>depth</b> <b>charges</b> exploded immediately afterward. His life was sacrificed in an attempt to save the ship and his shipmates, as the damage to the ship would have been much less if he had been able to release the <b>depth</b> <b>charges.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Sea Devil {{leveled off}} at [...] and rigged for <b>depth</b> <b>charging.</b> Twelve were counted; none was close. Escorts milled about {{overhead}} {{for the next}} 40minutes; then the sound of screws faded out. Pinging was heard for a while longer, and distant <b>depth</b> <b>charges</b> were heard for several hours.|$|R
5|$|The flotilla's second {{success was}} the night of 19/20 December 1941, again in the North Sea off the Dutch coast, when two boats engaged two R boats and one E boat. They passed twice at high speed before losing contact, but twice during the night they located them and {{eventually}} carried out <b>depth</b> <b>charge</b> attacks. Both Hichens and {{the commander of the}} other boat received a MID for this action.|$|E
5|$|The ship mounted four 4.7-inch Mk IX guns {{in single}} mounts, {{designated}} 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' {{from front to}} rear. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, Hero had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5inch Vickers Mk III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes. One <b>depth</b> <b>charge</b> rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. By mid-1940, this had increased to 44 depth charges.|$|E
5|$|The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch Mark IX guns {{in single}} mounts. For {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) defence, Delight {{had a single}} 12-pounder (3-inch (76.2mm)) gun between her funnels and two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5-inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes. One <b>depth</b> <b>charge</b> rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.|$|E
50|$|Anti-submarine warfare did {{not become}} an issue of great concern until World War I, when Germany used {{submarines}} {{in an attempt to}} strangle British shipping in the Atlantic Ocean and elsewhere. The earliest way to counter a submarine was in the form of <b>depth</b> <b>charges,</b> which were large canisters filled with explosives, rolled off the back of a ship and detonated by a hydrostatic fuse. <b>Depth</b> <b>charges</b> served well throughout World War I but were not without flaws. A ship had to pass directly over a submarine to score an effective hit, because of this <b>depth</b> <b>charges</b> were dropped in lines instead of more effective clusters and could only be carried in ships fast enough to avoid the concussion of the explosion. The <b>depth</b> <b>charges</b> were also not as effective as one might think at sinking a submarine - only a very close detonation would sink a submarine, and the problems of scoring a direct hit meant that a submarine was more often damaged then destroyed by <b>depth</b> <b>charges.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 1917 Thornycroft {{produced}} an enlarged [...] overall version. This allowed a heavier payload, and now two torpedoes could be carried. A mixed warload {{of a single}} torpedo and four <b>depth</b> <b>charges</b> could also be carried, the <b>depth</b> <b>charges</b> released from individual cradles over the sides, rather than a stern ramp.|$|R
50|$|Sea Devil {{leveled off}} at 500 ft and rigged for <b>depth</b> <b>charging.</b> Twelve were counted; none was close. Escorts milled about {{overhead}} {{for the next}} 40 minutes; then the sound of screws faded out. Pinging was heard for a while longer, and distant <b>depth</b> <b>charges</b> were heard for several hours.|$|R
5|$|The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch Mk IX guns {{in single}} mounts, {{designated}} 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' {{from front to}} rear. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, Garland had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5inch Vickers Mk III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes. One <b>depth</b> <b>charge</b> rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. By mid-1940, this had increased to 44 depth charges.|$|E
5|$|The ship mounted four 45-calibre QF 4.7-inch Mark IX guns {{in single}} mounts. For {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) defence, Dainty {{had a single}} 12-pounder (3-inch (76.2mm)) gun and two quadruple Mark I mounts for the QF 0.5-inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes. One <b>depth</b> <b>charge</b> rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.|$|E
5|$|The ship's primary {{armament}} {{consisted of}} a dozen 40-caliber 12.7cm Type 89 anti-aircraft (AA) guns in twin mounts. Their sponsons were positioned to allow them some measure of cross-deck fire. Katsuragi was also equipped with 22 triple 25mm Type 96 and thirty single Type 96 AA gun mounts, most on sponsons {{along the sides of}} the hull. These guns were supplemented by six 28-round AA rocket launchers. For defense against submarines, the carrier was fitted with six <b>depth</b> <b>charge</b> throwers and carried between six and ten depth charges for them.|$|E
5000|$|HMS Pathfinder helped [...] {{bring the}} Italian {{submarine}} Cobalto {{to the surface}} with <b>depth</b> <b>charges</b> off Bizerta, Tunisia in August 1942, and the submarine was rammed and sunk by HMS Ithuriel. The following month, HMS Pathfinder helped [...] and [...] sink the German submarine U-162 with <b>depth</b> <b>charges</b> in the mid-Atlantic.|$|R
500|$|Naval Station Norfolk1943 {{truckload}} {{explosion of}} 24 aerial <b>depth</b> <b>charges</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Ki-54d - {{maritime}} reconnaissance/ASW, carried 8x 60-kg (132-lb) <b>depth</b> <b>charges</b> ...|$|R
5|$|This {{involved}} {{the replacement of}} 'A' gun by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar, the removal of her director-control tower and rangefinder above the bridge {{in exchange for a}} Type 271 target indication radar, exchanging her two 2-pounder AA guns mounted between her funnels for two Oerlikon 20mm AA guns, the addition of two Oerlikon guns to her searchlight platform, and the removal of her 12-pounder AA gun. 'Y' gun was also removed to allow her <b>depth</b> <b>charge</b> stowage to be increased to 98 depth charges.|$|E
5|$|Bridges {{and other}} key points were {{prepared}} for demolition at short notice by preparing chambers filled with explosives. A <b>Depth</b> <b>Charge</b> Crater was a site in a road (usually at a junction) prepared with buried explosives that could be detonated to instantly form a deep crater as an anti-tank obstacle. The Canadian pipe mine (later known as the McNaughton Tube after General Andrew McNaughton) was a horizontally bored pipe packed with explosives– once in place this {{could be used to}} instantly ruin a road or runway. Prepared demolitions had the advantage of being undetectable from the air—the enemy could not take any precautions against them, or plot a route of attack around them.|$|E
5|$|Hayward assumed {{command of}} the Naval Ordnance Laboratory at White Oak, Maryland in June 1954. He was the first naval aviator to do so, all the {{previous}} commanders having been naval ordnance officers. Under his guidance, the Naval Ordnance Laboratory developed the Mark 52 naval mine, an air-delivered weapon with acoustic, magnetic and pressure sensors. Hayward encountered some resistance with this project, as mine warfare was a neglected field in the Navy. The Naval Ordnance Laboratory also developed the Mark 90 nuclear bomb, a nuclear <b>depth</b> <b>charge,</b> which was tested during Operation Wigwam in May 1955.|$|E

5000|$|Reverted to {{maintenance}} status after the War, the Annex was reactivated for the Korean War, {{during which time}} it held some of the Navy's first experimental nuclear <b>depth</b> <b>charges,</b> in bunker N9. [...] <b>Depth</b> <b>charges,</b> bombs, and rocket motors were assembled at the Annex until declared surplus, by the Navy, in 1962.|$|R
