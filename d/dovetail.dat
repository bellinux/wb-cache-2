5|$|Meyer {{originally}} planned {{to write a}} companion book to Twilight called Midnight Sun, {{which would be the}} story of Twilight told from Edward Cullen's point-of-view. She stated that Twilight was the only book that she planned to rewrite from Edward's perspective. However, a rough draft of Midnight Sun's first twelve chapters was leaked on the internet. Meyer has since put these twelve chapters on her website so that her fans could read them for free, but has put the project on hold indefinitely due to her feelings about the situation. She stated, If I tried to write Midnight Sun now, in my current frame of mind, James would probably win and all the Cullens would die, which wouldn't <b>dovetail</b> too well with the original story. In any case, I feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on Midnight Sun, and so it is on hold indefinitely. Though she has no current plans to do so, Meyer has also stated that if she were to continue writing in the same universe she would write from the perspective of either Leah Clearwater or Bella and Edward's daughter, Renesmee Cullen.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{familiar}} quandary {{arises when}} there are several possible alternatives for the solution of a problem, but {{no way of knowing}} which, if any, are viable for a particular problem instance. Faced with this un-certainty, one is forced to simulate the parallel exploration of alternatives through some kind of co-ordinated interleaving (<b>dovetailing)</b> process. As usual, the goal is to find a solution with low total cost. Much of the exist-ing work on such problems has assumed, implicitly or explicitly, that at most one of the alternatives is viable, providing support for a competi-tive analysis of algorithms (using the cost of the unique viable alternative as a benchmark). In this paper, we relax this worst-case assumption in revisiting several familiar <b>dovetailing</b> problems. Our main contribution is the introduction of a novel process interleav-ing technique, called hyperbolic <b>dovetailing</b> that achieves a competitive ra-tio that is within a logarithmic factor of optimal on all inputs in the worst, average and expected cases, over all possible deterministic (and random-ized) <b>dovetailing</b> schemes. We also show that no other <b>dovetailing</b> strategy can guarantee an asymptotically smaller competitive ratio for all inputs. An interesting application of hyperbolic <b>dovetailing</b> arises in the de-sign of what we call input-thrifty algorithms, algorithms that are de-signed to minimize the total precision of the input requested in order to evaluate some given predicate. We show that for some very basic predi-cates involving real numbers we can use hyperbolic <b>dovetailing</b> to provide input-thrifty algorithms that are competitive, in this novel cost measure, with the best algorithms that solve these problems. ...|$|R

25|$|The Hamada pistol is a {{blowback}} {{pistol and}} functionally {{a copy of}} the Browning Model 1910. The most significant design difference between the Hamada pistol and Browning Model 1910 is the replacement of the interrupter lugs used to hold the barrel of the Browning Model 1910 with a <b>dovetail</b> joint. The frame plate lock design and striker assembly were also modified and awarded patents in 1943. The Hamada pistol maintained high quality throughout its production, with the bluing done to a high standard. The safety, rear frame plate, and extractor were heat tempered to a reddish brown and the barrel, striker, and firing mechanism were brightly polished.|$|E

The front post is fully adjustable for both windage and elevation zero and is enclosed in a protective hood. Low-light flip-up front blade and rear sight elements have three self-luminous tritium capsules (betalights) which are calibrated for 100 m when deployed. When the rear night sight is flipped up for use, the rear aperture sights must be placed in an offset position intermediate between the two apertures. Certain variants have a receiver-mounted <b>dovetail</b> adapter {{that is used to}} mount various optical sights.|$|E

Subsequent attempts to <b>dovetail</b> federal and provincial legislation to achieve certain ends met with difficulty, such as an attempt by Saskatchewan to ensure enforcement of a federal statute by enacting a complementary Act declaring that the federal Act would continue in force under provincial authority if it was ruled ultra vires. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal ruled a federal and provincial Act ultra vires, voiding both as {{an attempt by the}} province to vest powers in parliament unauthorized by the BNA Act.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the hybrid}} {{strategies}} described above, using captive hydrogen to generate other more easily usable fuels, {{might be more}} effective than hydrogen-production alone. Short term energy storage (meaning the energy is used not long after it has been captured) may be best accomplished with battery or even ultracapacitor storage. Longer term energy storage (meaning the energy is used weeks or months after capture) may be better done with synthetic methane or alcohols, which can be stored indefinitely at relatively low cost, and even used directly in some type of fuel cells, for electric vehicles. These strategies <b>dovetail</b> well with the recent interest in Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles, or PHEVs, which use a hybrid strategy of electrical and fuel storage for their energy needs.|$|E
25|$|With the {{establishment}} of SAS, Flesland became an important NATO training station. The logistics surrounding the use by a strike force, Operation <b>Dovetail,</b> was carried out every four to eight weeks. Every other year there were larger exercises with about a dozen aircraft and lasting for several weeks. It is believed that {{in case of a}} nuclear strike on the Soviet Union, the nuclear warheads would be transferred to Flesland from other sites in Europe, ready for the arrival of the attack aircraft. The confidentiality meant that most of the RNoAF was unknown to Flesland's strategic role and in the late 1960s the airport was proposed closed in the late 1960s by parts of the RNoAF unaware of its function. This caused the American strike force to also receive a conventional role, which could be made public and be used as a public excuse to retain the operational level at Flesland.|$|E

40|$|Many search {{algorithms}} have parameters {{that need}} to be tuned to get the best performance. Typically, the parameters are tuned offline, resulting in a generic setting that is supposed to be effective on all problem instances. For suboptimal single-agent search, problem-instance-specific parameter settings can result in substantially reduced search effort. We consider the use of <b>dovetailing</b> as a way {{to take advantage of this}} fact. <b>Dovetailing</b> is a procedure that performs search with multiple parameter settings simultaneously. <b>Dovetailing</b> is shown to improve the search speed of weighted IDA* by several orders of magnitude and to generally enhance the performance of weighted RBFS. This procedure is trivially parallelizable and is shown to be an effective form of parallelization for WA * and BULB. In particular, using WA * with parallel <b>dovetailing</b> yields good speedups in the sliding-tile puzzle domain, and increases the number of problems solved when used in an automated planning system. 1...|$|R

500|$|The {{wooden panel}} {{measures}} 163by110centimetres(64by43inches) and {{is composed of}} five vertical deals (softwood planks) reinforced by two horizontal <b>dovetail</b> battens. The battens, together with the rough scrub planed back, have effectively reduced warping to a minimum and the artwork is well preserved, with only insignificant fissures and attacks by insects. [...] A dendrochronological examination of the panel by doctor Peter Klein at the Institute für Holzbiologie in Hamburg determined that it is made of pine deals (Pinus silvestris), the annual rings of which date from various periods ranging from the 1480s to around 1618. The painting can therefore date no further back than around 1620. This {{is consistent with the}} year 1636 given on the frame and mentioned in the parish accounts.|$|E
500|$|The present {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by Watkin George. George had been trained as a carpenter, but in 1792 became the chief engineer of the ironworks and {{a partner in the}} business. The bridge is composed of two cast iron A-frame trusses supporting a rectangular 2-foot by 6-foot-2-inch cast iron trough. This lower trough carried the Taff Fechan leat and acts as a girder supporting the plates acting as the railway sleepers, into which the rail chairs are integrally cast. [...] Wooden uprights were attached to the iron risers that passed through the apex of each of the A-frames and these supported the upper trough carrying the Taff Fawr leat. Reflecting its designer's roots in carpentry, the members composing the trusses are joined by <b>dovetail</b> and mortise and tenon joints commonly used in wooden structures.|$|E

500|$|During Perón's time, {{children}} born to unmarried parents {{did not have the}} same legal rights as those born to married parents. Biographer Julie M.

[...] Taylor speculates that Evita's awareness of this may have influenced her decision to have the law changed so that [...] "illegitimate" [...] children would henceforth be referred to as [...] "natural" [...] children. Upon her death, the Argentine public was told that Evita was only 30. The discrepancy was meant to <b>dovetail</b> with Evita's earlier tampering with her birth certificate. After becoming the first lady in 1946, Evita had her birth records altered to read that she had been born to married parents, and placed her birth date three years later, making herself younger.|$|E

500|$|Though France showed {{solidarity}} {{with the rest of}} NATO during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, de Gaulle continued his pursuit of an independent defence by removing France's Atlantic and Channel fleets from NATO command.

US Secretary of State Dean Rusk was later quoted as asking de Gaulle whether his order included [...] "the bodies of American soldiers in France's cemeteries?" [...] This withdrawal forced the relocation of SHAPE from Rocquencourt, near Paris, to Casteau, north of Mons, Belgium, by 16October 1967. France remained a member of the alliance, and committed to the defence of Europe from possible Warsaw Pact attack with its own forces stationed in the Federal Republic of Germany throughout the Cold War.
