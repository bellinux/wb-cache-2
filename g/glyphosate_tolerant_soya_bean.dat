In order to know the effects of recovery growth of the late-planted <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> in maize–soya bean relay intercropping, a field experiment was carried out to observe architectural, morphological, physiological and anatomical traits of <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> plants related to shade and subsequent removal in intercropping before and after maize harvest, respectively. During shade period, <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> biomass was severely reduced, and stem elongation was stimulated. Typical features of shade grown leaves were found, such as lower LMA (leaf mass per unit area), thinner thickness, higher chlorophyll content, lower chlorophyll a:b ratio. Whole-plant leaf area analysis found that <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> increased leaf area ratio by adjusting leaf morphology rather than by dry mass allocation. After maize harvest, leaf area and leaf mass increased rapidly, contributing to compensation growth in intercropped <b>soya</b> <b>bean.</b> Meanwhile, physiological and anatomical traits of leaf went back to similar levels as grown in sole cropping. However, stem morphological traits were irreversible after removal of shade. Finally, no difference on seed weight per plant of <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> was observed between relay intercropping and sole cropping.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the bioavailability of selenium (Se) from milled <b>soya</b> <b>beans,</b> a plant protein, to lambs after various degrees of heat treatment. Thirty Dohne Merino lambs (ca. 25 kg live weight, 4 months old) were allocated randomly within sex and weight groups into three treatment groups. During the experimental period, they were fed a diet consisting of a large proportion of milled <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> as their main source of Se and other feeds low in Se to balance the diet. Blood was drawn during this period and analysed for Se and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity. Chemical and Se analyses were performed on the feed and <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> samples as well as on the organs, wool and rumen fluid of the lambs. Although the ADIN concentration of the <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> increased with increasing heat treatments, more heat damage could have been inflicted on it to differentiate the different <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> fractions in comparison to each other. On average, the in sacco disappearance of the dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) and Se was higher for the unprocessed <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> compared to the two processed <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> fractions. As a result, the lambs receiving the unprocessed <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> (control group- C-group) had a significant higher rumen bacterial Se concentration than the lambs receiving the heat¬treated <b>soya</b> <b>beans.</b> Despite this higher concentration, the liver Se concentration of this group was statistically significantly lower compared to the two heat-treated groups. This can be interpreted that the heat processing of the <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> enhanced its Se fraction to be taken up by the liver. However, those differences were biologically not significant. The average liver Se concentration between the lambs receiving the over- ¬processed- (a-group) and those receiving the ideal treated <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> (I-group), did not differ, indicating that the excessive heat treatment did not influence the amount of Se reaching the lower digestive tract of the a-group. Although the Se concentration of the heart muscle of the a-group was statistically significantly lower than for the I-and C-groups, those differences biologically were not significant. Despite an increase in the erythrocyte GSH-Px activity over the duration of the trial in all three the treatment groups, no significant differences between the three treatment groups were observed at any stage. It is concluded from this study that the heat treatment of <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> has not influenced the incorporation and the bioavailability of its Se fraction to any significant degree.

These studies also showed that the protein content of tempeh improved significantly after using <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> milk wastes. Thus, <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> milk wastes can used as a substitute of raw material for making a protein-rich human food instead of being thrown out. Various kinds of tempeh and tempeh-like products are available in Indonesia (Lim 1991).|$|R
50|$|Her first cargo after {{restoration}} was <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> to Macduff, Scotland. Between 1987 and 1996, she {{was often}} to be seen at Wells next the Sea delivering her cargo of <b>soya</b> <b>beans.</b> With the closure of Wells as a commercial port in September 1995 {{her career as a}} cargo ship was finally over. The final load of 100 tons of <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> were delivered on 5 September 1996. During this time, her cargos included corn, phosphates and timber. Apart from the regular run between Ghent and Wells, Albatros visited ports in the Channel Islands, Denmark, England, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Norway, Poland, Scotland and Sweden, sometimes making faster passages than motor driven ships.|$|R
40|$|Many {{decisions}} in agriculture are made over combinations of inputs and/or practices {{that may be}} complements. The presence of complementarity among producer decisions can have deep implications for market outcomes and for the effectiveness of policies intended to influence them. Identifying complementarity relations, however, is a challenging pursuit. Drawing on recent methodological advances, {{in this paper we}} propose a new test for complementarity between <b>glyphosate</b> <b>tolerant</b> soybeans and conservation tillage that overcomes limitations of previous studies. Specifically, we develop a structural discrete choice framework of joint soybean-tillage adoption that explicitly models both complementarity and unobserved heterogeneity. The model is estimated with a large dataset of farm-level choices that spans the 1998 – 2011 period and contains repeated observations for many of the sampled individuals. We find that <b>glyphosate</b> <b>tolerant</b> soybeans and conservation tillage are indeed complementary practices, a conclusion supported by several robustness checks. In addition, our estimation shows that farm operation scale promotes the adoption of both conservation tillage and <b>glyphosate</b> <b>tolerant</b> seed, and that all of higher fuel prices, more droughty conditions, and soil erodibility increase use of conservation tillage. We also apply our results to simulate annual adoption rates for conservation tillage in a scenario without <b>glyphosate</b> <b>tolerant</b> soybeans available as a choice. We find that the adoption of conservation tillage has been about ten percent higher due to the advent of <b>glyphosate</b> <b>tolerant</b> soybeans...|$|R
