50|$|Visitors to the outback often {{drive their}} own or rented vehicles, or take {{organised}} tours. Travel through remote areas on main roads is easily done and requires no planning. However travel through very remote areas, on isolated tracks, requires planning and a suitable, reliable vehicle (usually a four-wheel drive). On very remote routes considerable supplies and equipment may be required; this can include prearranged caches. It is not advisable to travel into these especially remote areas with a single vehicle, unless fully equipped with good communication technology (e.g. a satellite phone, EPIRB etc.). Many visitors prefer to travel in these areas in a convoy. Deaths of tourists and locals becoming stranded on outback trips occasionally occur, sometimes because insufficient water and food supplies were taken, or because people have walked away from their vehicle in search of help. Travellers through very remote areas should always inform a reliable person of their route and expected <b>destination</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>time,</b> and remember that a vehicle {{is much easier to}} locate in an aerial search, than a person, so {{in the event of a}} breakdown, they must not leave their vehicle.|$|E

The Western countries have a far better control on the pace of number of vehicles on a road matched with supporting infrastructure. In contrast, cash strapped underdeveloped countries have a poorly built and scarce number of main roads with problems compounded by soft car loans, leases and other discounts. As a result several developing countries have been inundated with peripheral complications such as pollution and congestion undermining their economy with enormous energy bills negatively impacting respective economy.

40|$|Abstract—For many {{applications}} in mobile wireless ad hoc networks (MANETs), forming an end-to-end data path {{is not always}} necessary; instead, the primary routing goal is often data collection or dissemination where only a data source is known. Routing algorithms must be carefully chosen in order to suit the needs of applications employing them. Our focus is on data collection applications in MANETs where limited mobility information is required to route data in a scalable manner. To address this goal, we employ the concepts of delaytolerant networking (DTN) in which data makes progress toward a destination with high latency expectations and little knowledge of routing topology. Specifically, we present time-to-network (TTN) forwarding, a method of forwarding data generated by mobile nodes to a network endpoint {{in such a way}} that delivery latency is lowered without high networking cost. By segmenting mobility patterns into trips, we are able to apply TTN to a vehicular network using only an estimated <b>destination</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> for each vehicle. We evaluate TTN using mobility data from the TRANSIMS simulator for a real road network. Results show that our algorithm produces collection-to-network latencies similar to more generic algorithms but at a lower cost and with higher efficiency. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound for delivery latency in our experiments and compare it to TTN. This also helps normalize the interpretation of results specific to our mobility model. I...|$|E

An unimpeded taxiway is {{a path for}} an aircraft to taxi around an active runway. Unimpeded taxiways provide benefits such as increased departure throughput, increased safety, reduced surface congestion, more efficient taxi-in procedures, and thereby also yield environmental benefits. The goals of this work are to investigate the use of current taxiways, examine surface performance and fuel burn trade-offs, {{and to develop a}} decision-support model based on potential fuel savings of unimpeded taxiways. This study analyzes unimpeded taxiway use at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport (ATL), Dallas/Fort-Worth International Airport (DFW), and Detroit Metro Airport (DTW) using ASDE-X data from 10 September 2012 to 28 February 2013. The trends and patterns of aircraft taxi routes show the unimpeded taxiway is used the most during peak arrival and peak departure hours. This study provides decision-makers at the operations level a practical guidance tool with the necessary information to effectively use unimpeded taxiways and conventional taxiways from an environmental perspective. Decision rules were developed to maximize fuel savings. The decision scenario analysis concluded that the most promising decision rule at ATL, DFW, and DTW to yield the most environmental benefit is based on multiple factors.

40|$|The {{long term}} {{prediction}} of maritime vessels' <b>destinations</b> and <b>arrival</b> <b>times</b> {{is essential for}} making an effective logistics planning. As ships are influenced by various factors {{over a long period}} of time, the solution cannot be achieved by analyzing sailing patterns of each entity separately. Instead, an approach is required, that can extract maritime patterns for the area in question and represent it in a form suitable for querying all possible routes any vessel in that region can take. To tackle this problem we use a genetic algorithm (GA) to cluster vessel position data obtained from the publicly available Automatic Identification System (AIS). The resulting clusters are treated as route waypoints (WP), and by connecting them we get nodes and edges of a directed graph depicting maritime patterns. Since standard clustering algorithms have difficulties in handling data with varying density, and genetic algorithms are slow when handling large data volumes, in this paper we investigate how to enhance the genetic algorithm to allow fast and accurate waypoint identification. We also include a quad tree structure to preprocess data and reduce the input for the GA. When the route graph is created, we add post processing to remove inconsistencies caused by noise in the AIS data. Finally, we validate the results produced by the GA by comparing resulting patterns with known inland water routes for two Dutch provinces...|$|R

40|$|Estimating {{the future}} {{position}} of a deep sea vessel more than 24 hours in advance is a major challenge for Dutch logistics service providers (LSPs). Their unscheduled arrival in ports directly impacts scheduling and waiting times of barges, propagating throughout the entire supply chain network.

To create such graph we need an efficient way to extract waypoints for traffic data and this is the problem we will address in this paper. Since LSPs only use publicly available data for arrival estimation, our solution is entirely based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Extracting positional information from AIS, we explore various machine learning approaches to identify clusters. We apply DBSCAN algorithm and show its advantages and disadvantages when used on AIS data. The same process is repeated using meta-heuristics, comparing clustering results generated by a genetic algorithm and by modified ant-colony optimization to those produced by DBSCAN. Finally, we present a hybrid approach and its ability to discover waypoints, highlighting the achieved improvements. To extend the problem, two constraints are added. The first is the requirement to handle large volumes of streaming AIS data on standard PC-based hardware. The second introduces the common situation of "dark areas" in a map due to problems with receiving and transmitting AIS data.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} routing in emerging wireless networks where nodes move around explicitly carrying messages to facilitate communication in an otherwise partitioned network. The absence of a path at any instant of time between a source and destination makes the traditional mobile ad hoc routing protocols unsuitable for these networks. However, the explicit node movements create paths "over time" that include {{the possibility of a}} node carrying a message before forwarding to another suitable node. Identifying such paths over space and time is a key challenge in these store, carry and forward networks. In most of these networks, the mobility of nodes is predictable either over a finite time horizon or indefinitely due to periodicity in node motion. We propose a new space-time routing framework for these networks leveraging the predictability in node motion. Specifically, we construct space-time routing tables where the next hop node is selected from the current as well as the future neighbors. Unlike traditional routing tables, our space-time routing tables use both the <b>destination</b> and the <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> of message to determine the next hop node. We devise an algorithm to compute these spacetime routing tables to minimize the end-to-end message delivery delay. Our routing algorithm is based on a space-time graph model derived from the mobility of nodes.

This feature points to the necessity of <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> measurements with additional information on the curvature of the EAS disk.

40|$|This article {{develops}} the optimal single step toll scheme which is levied to bulk ships for a queuing port. Bulk ships' <b>arrival</b> <b>times</b> {{at the port}} will be rationally dispersed after pricing this toll scheme. Consequently, the queuing time at the anchorage to all bulk ships will be rationally decreased. This article shows bulk ships' equilibrium arrival rate distributions during the queuing period before and after establishing the optimal single step toll scheme. This article also shows bulk ship owners' decisions of <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> adjustments under the optimal single step toll scheme. Based on these results, we find some bulk ships that paid no toll under the optimal single step toll scheme to maintain the same <b>arrival</b> <b>times</b> at the anchorage {{as they did in}} the original nontoll equilibrium situation. New <b>arrival</b> <b>times</b> at the anchorage for other bulk ships that paid the toll are postponed when compared with their original <b>arrival</b> <b>times</b> in the nontoll equilibrium situation. ...|$|R
