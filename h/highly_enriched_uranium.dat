5|$|Frank Spedding's Ames Project had {{developed}} the Ames process, {{a method of}} producing uranium metal on an industrial scale, but Cyril Stanley Smith, the CM Division's associate leader in charge of metallurgy, was concerned about using it with <b>highly</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> due to the danger of forming a critical mass. <b>Highly</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> was also far more valuable than natural uranium, {{and he wanted to}} avoid the loss of even a milligram. He recruited Richard D. Baker, a chemist who had worked with Spedding, and together they adapted the Ames Process for use at the Los Alamos laboratory. In February Baker and his group made twenty 360 gram reductions and twenty-seven 500 gram reductions with <b>highly</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> tetrafluoride.|$|E
5|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that {{spent nuclear fuel}} and high-level reprocessing and plutonium wastes require well-designed storage for periods ranging from tens of thousands to a million years, to minimize releases of the contained radioactivity into the environment. Safeguards are also required to ensure that neither plutonium nor <b>highly</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> is diverted to weapon use. There is general agreement that placing spent nuclear fuel in repositories hundreds of meters below the surface would be safer than indefinite storage of spent fuel on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Because {{uranium-235}} {{was known}} to be fissionable, it was the first material pursued in the approach to bomb development. As the first design developed (as well as the first deployed for combat), it is sometimes known as the Mark I. The vast majority of the work {{came in the form of}} the isotope enrichment of the uranium necessary for the weapon, since uranium-235 makes up only 1 part in 140 of natural uranium. Enrichment was performed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the electromagnetic separation plant, known as Y-12, became fully operational in March 1944. The first shipments of <b>highly</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> were sent to the Los Alamos Laboratory in June 1944.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "SM-1" [...] {{stands for}} Stationary, Medium-size reactor, {{prototype}} #1.

50|$|Uranium is an {{incompatible}} element within magmas, {{and as such}} {{it tends}} to become accumulated within highly fractionated and evolved granite melts, particularly alkaline examples. These melts tend to become <b>highly</b> <b>enriched</b> in <b>uranium,</b> thorium and potassium, and may in turn create internal pegmatites or hydrothermal systems into which uranium may dissolve.|$|R
25|$|Most BWR and PWR {{commercial}} reactors use <b>uranium</b> <b>enriched</b> {{to about}} 4% U-235, and some commercial reactors {{with a high}} neutron economy do not require the fuel to be enriched at all (that is, they can use natural uranium). According to the International Atomic Energy Agency {{there are at least}} 100 research reactors in the world fueled by <b>highly</b> <b>enriched</b> (weapons-grade/90% enrichment <b>uranium).</b> Theft risk of this fuel (potentially used in the production of a nuclear weapon) has led to campaigns advocating conversion of this type of reactor to low-enrichment uranium (which poses less threat of proliferation).|$|R
5|$|Production {{commenced}} in February 1945, and {{the first}} product was shipped to the calutrons in March. By April, the gaseous diffusion plant was producing 1.1 percent product. It was then decided that instead of processing uranium hexafluoride feed from the Harshaw Chemical Company, the gaseous diffusion plant would take {{the product of the}} S-50 thermal diffusion plant, with an average enrichment of about 0.85 percent. Product enrichment continued to improve, as more stages came online and performed better than anticipated. In June product was being enriched to 7 percent; by September it was 23 percent. The S-50 plant ceased operation on 9 September, and Kellex transferred the last unit to Union Carbide on 11 September 1945. <b>Highly</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> was used in the Little Boy atomic bomb used in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945.|$|E

50|$|The type {{locality}} for paulscherrerite is the Number 2 Workings, Radium Ridge near Mount Painter, North Flinders Ranges, South Australia, {{which contains}} {{large volumes of}} granites and gneisses <b>highly</b> <b>enriched</b> in <b>uranium</b> and thorium. The Number 2 Workings expose a lens of massive coarse-grained hematite with a fine-grained monazite-(Ce), xenotime-(Y), and Ca-Fe-phosphate matrix and abundant iron-rich euxenite. The radiogenic heat produced by Uranium-Thorium-Potassium-rich rocks drove hydrothermal activity over {{hundreds of millions of}} years. These conditions of high-temperature hydrothermal mineralization are ideal for the formation and deposition of abundant deposits of paulscherrerite, a dehydration product of metaschoepite. Secondary uranium minerals occur in cavities of the predominant hematite/quartz includingweeksite, beta-uranophane, metatorbernite, soddyite, kasolite, billietite, and barite. Figure 3. shows the geomorphology of the Mt. Gee - Mt.Painter epithermal system. “Dehydrated-schoepite” has also been identified as anearly product of uraninite weathering in the Ruggles and Palermo graniticpegmatites, New Hampshire, U.S.|$|R
40|$|Among the {{safeguarding}} practices {{aimed at}} the detection of undeclared nuclear activities, the importance of environmental sampling and nuclear forensics has grown in the last decades. In fact, the production of raw materials for nuclear weapons can be pursued either by processes to produce very <b>highly</b> <b>enriched</b> (weapon-grade) <b>Uranium</b> or by chemical separation of plutonium from reactor¿s spent fuel, in a hidden branching of an officially nonmilitary nuclear fuel cycle. Both these processes {{will result in the}} release to the environment of some characteristic materials, which {{can be found in the}} liquid and gaseous effluents or concentrated in sediments, soils, vegetation, livestock and biota. In this paper, some environmental sampling based techniques aimed at supplying evidence of plutonium production facilities are discussed, with particular attention to wide area atmospheric monitoring of Kr- 85 and on environmental signatures in the environs just around a reprocessing plant.

To convert several high power reactors, monolithic fuel, a new fuel type, is being developed. This fuel type replaces the standard fuel dispersion with a fuel alloy foil, which allows for fuel densities far in excess of that found in dispersion fuel. The single-piece fuel foil also contains a significantly lower interface area between the fuel and the aluminum in the plate than the standard fuel type, limiting the amount of detrimental fuel-aluminum interaction that can occur.

5|$|During the Cold War {{between the}} Soviet Union and the United States, huge {{stockpiles}} of uranium were amassed {{and tens of}} thousands of nuclear weapons were created using <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> and plutonium made from uranium. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, an estimated 600short tons (540metric tons) of <b>highly</b> <b>enriched</b> weapons grade <b>uranium</b> (enough to make 40,000 nuclear warheads) have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the Russian Federation and several other former Soviet states. Police in Asia, Europe, and South America on at least 16 occasions from 1993 to 2005 have intercepted shipments of smuggled bomb-grade uranium or plutonium, most of which was from ex-Soviet sources. From 1993 to 2005 the Material Protection, Control, and Accounting Program, operated by the federal government of the United States, spent approximately US $550 million to help safeguard uranium and plutonium stockpiles in Russia. This money was used for improvements and security enhancements at research and storage facilities. Scientific American reported in February 2006 that in some of the facilities security consisted of chain link fences which were in severe states of disrepair. According to an interview from the article, one facility had been storing samples of <b>enriched</b> (weapons grade) <b>uranium</b> in a broom closet before the improvement project; another had been keeping track of its stock of nuclear warheads using index cards kept in a shoe box.|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{mechanisms}} {{for the production}} o 1 f 4 C. in ground water by activation of 14 N, 170, and 13 C by emissions from uranium and thorium nuclei have been proposed. These mechanisms were investigated in laboratory and field settings to determine applicability in the natural environment {{and the extent to}} which error may be introduced in a ¹⁴C date due to in situ ¹⁴C production. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that calculated and measured ¹⁴C production in irradiated samples of ammonium nitrate solution and distilled water agreed within an order of magnitude. The methane and carbon dioxide fractions of a natural gas with a high nitrogen content were ¹⁴C dated. The methane contained no ¹⁴C, but due to analytical difficulties, the ¹⁴C activity of the carbon dioxide could not be accurately ascertained. These investigations indicate that in situ ¹⁴C production will not influence ¹⁴C dating of ground water except under unique circumstances. Only if the source rock is <b>highly</b> <b>enriched</b> in <b>uranium</b> and the sample of water or gas from the source rock has a high concentration of nitrogen may in situ production of ¹⁴C produce an error in a ¹⁴C date if the ¹⁴C dating range is not extended beyond 50, 000 BP...|$|R

However, the most frequently used method is through fission of uranium-235 in a nuclear reactor. While most reactors currently engaged in 99Mo production use <b>highly</b> <b>enriched</b> uranium-235 targets, proliferation concerns have prompted some producers to transition to low <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> targets The target is irradiated with neutrons to form 99Mo as a fission product.

[...] The amount of uranium present in all currently known conventional reserves alone (excluding the huge quantities of currently-uneconomical uranium present in [...] "unconventional" [...] reserves such as phosphate/phosphorite deposits, seawater, and other sources) is enough to last over 200 years at current consumption rates. Fuel efficiency in conventional reactors has increased over time.

Similar efforts have been utilizing weapons-grade plutonium to produce mixed oxide (MOX) fuel, which is also produced from reprocessing used fuel. Other components of used fuel are currently less commonly utilized, but have a substantial capacity for reuse, especially so in next-generation fast neutron reactors. Over 35 European reactors are licensed to use MOX fuel, as well as Russian and American nuclear plants.
