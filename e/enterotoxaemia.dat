40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} is a Gram-positive, anaerobic bac-terium that {{is widely}} {{distributed in the}} environment; it is found in soil and commonly inhabits the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals 1, 2. The ubiquitous nature of this bacterium has resulted in it becoming {{a major cause of}} histotoxic and enteric diseases 3. The success of C. perfrin-gens as both a pathogen and a commensal bacterium lies in its ability to produce a large number of potent toxins and extracellular enzymes 4. This diverse toxin repertoire results in a broad range of diseases including gas gangrene, various <b>enterotoxaemias,</b> food poisoning and necrotic enteritis 4 – 6.

40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} is a Gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium {{that causes}} histotoxic infections and <b>enterotoxaemias</b> in humans and domestic animals. This bacterium owes its pathogenicity {{to the production}} of a large arsenal of toxins, including the C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) and beta 2 toxin (CPB 2). Type A, cpe-chromosomal isolates cause human food-poisoning (FP), whereas type A, cpe-plasmid isolates cause human antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD). Symptoms of AAD are more severe and longer in duration than symptoms of FP. We hypothesized that AAD isolates may produce an accessory toxin, which would contribute to pathogenesis, as an explanation for these symptomatic differences. Consequently, the goal of this dissertation was to determine; 1) whether the recently discovered, plasmid-encoded, CPB 2 toxin was produced by AAD isolates, 2) how this toxin functions in vitro, and 3) its role in vivo (in the context of human and animal disease). PCR analysis, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis/Southern blotting, and DNA sequencing determined that the cpb 2 gene is preferentially associated with AAD isolates (but not FP isolates), in part, due to its presence on some cpe-encoding plasmids. Sequencing of cpe and cpe/cpb 2 plasmids found a large region of plasmid DNA, encoding a conjugal-gene cluster, which appears conserved amongst most C. perfringens virulence plasmids. Subsequent sequencing of a number of cpb 2 genes identified two CPB 2 variants, both of which are produced (detected using Western blot). Neutral red cytotoxicity assays using purified CPB 2 demonstrated that CPB 2 h 1 is more cytotoxic for Caco- 2 cells than CPB 2 h 2 and this activity is heat labile. Further in vitro work (using 86 Rubidium release assays and osmotic stabilizers) suggested that CPB 2 acts by disrupting membrane permeability. In vivo experiments confirmed that our CPB 2 preparations also were lethal using a mouse intravenous injection model. However, efforts to develop a more realistic model of pathogenesis (which initiates in the intestines) should be continued to furtheranalyze the role of CPB 2 in pathogenesis. Ultimately, the production of CPB 2 by most AAD isolates, as opposed to FP isolates, could provide an explanation for the more severe symptoms associated with AAD cases and suggests that CPB 2 may be involved in human gastrointestinal disease...|$|R
40|$|<b>Enterotoxaemia</b> is an {{important}} cause of sudden death in veal calves. This study aimed to evaluate intestinal Clostridium perfringens counts as a diagnostic tool for <b>enterotoxaemia.</b> Field necropsies were conducted on 48 sudden death cases in Belgian Blue veal farms. In 31 / 48 suddenly deceased calves, the diagnosis of <b>enterotoxaemia</b> was made based on haemorrhagic lesions in the small intestines, while in seven of these cases, no clear-cut diagnosis could be made based on macroscopic appearance of the gut.

40|$|<b>Enterotoxaemia</b> {{of sheep}} and goats occurs worldwide, but the {{condition}} in goats is poorly understood. The disease in goats is mostly caused by Clostridium perfringens type D, although {{the role of the}} toxins of this microorganism in the pathogenesis of the disease is not fully understood. The disease occurs in three forms, peracute, acute and chronic, the cardinal clinical sign of the acute and chronic forms being diarrhoea. The main biochemical alterations are hyperglycaemia and glycosuria, while at necropsy the disease is often characterized by haemorrhagic colitis. The typical histological changes observed in the brain of sheep with <b>enterotoxaemia</b> are not considered to be a common feature of <b>enterotoxaemia</b> in goats. Although the pathogenesis of caprine <b>enterotoxaemia</b> has not yet been properly defined, it is usually accepted that the presence of C. perfringens type D in the small bowel, together with a sudden change to a diet rich in carbohydrates, is the main predisposing factor for the disease.

40|$|Bovine <b>enterotoxaemia</b> {{caused by}} Clostridium {{perfringens}} type A most often presents as a sudden death syndrome with necro-hemorrhagic small intestinal lesions in suckling calves and veal calves (Muylaert et al., 2010). Alpha toxin, in synergy with perfringolysin O, {{has recently been}} proposed as an essential factor for the induction of <b>enterotoxaemia</b> in calves (Verherstraeten et al., 2013). Due to the rapid progress of the disease, preventive measures such as vaccination are of crucial importance to control <b>enterotoxaemia.</b> In this study, we compared the protective potential of a C. perfringens crude toxin preparation and the formalin-inactivated counterpart. Subcutaneous vaccination of calves with either of these preparations resulted in a strong antibody response against alpha toxin and perfringolysin O. However, only antibodies produced by animals immunized with native, non-inactivated toxin preparations were able to inhibit C. perfringens induced cytotoxicity and offered protection against bovine <b>enterotoxaemia</b> in a previously validated intestinal loop model (Valgaeren et al., 2013). These results show a discrepancy between the antibody titers raised against formalin-inactivated C. perfringens toxins and the protective capacity. Inactivation using formalin may modify crucial epitopes of the toxins, eliminating the toxin-neutralizing capacity of the evoked antibodies. However, vaccination with C. perfringens toxins may be valuable to protect calves from <b>enterotoxaemia</b> and other inactivation methods need to be explored...|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} newly {{formulated}} <b>enterotoxaemia</b> vaccine having oil and alum adjuvants, with presently available toxoid and alum precipitated vaccines. Materials and Methods: Three types of <b>enterotoxaemia</b> vaccines, namely toxoid (TV), alum precipitated (APV) and alum precipitated {{oil adjuvant vaccine}} (AOV) were prepared using a highly toxigenic strain of Clostridium perfringens type D procured from Division of Biological Standardization, IVRI, Izatnagar. Humoral immunity generated in rabbits with these vaccines was then quantified using {{indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) and mice neutralization test (MNT). Results: Out of three <b>enterotoxaemia</b> vaccines tested, alum precipitated oil adjuvant vaccine produced higher and persistent antibody titre for more than 45 days without any booster dose and did not produce any untoward reactions at the injection site. Alum precipitated vaccine elicited better and persistent immune response than toxoid vaccine though it was less than alum precipitated oil adjuvant vaccine. In MNT, alum precipitated and alum precipitated oil adjuvant vaccines showed protection at 45 th day of post vaccination while toxoid vaccine showed only up to 28 th day. Conclusion: Results of the study unfolded the synergistic role of adjuvants in the induction of better and persistent immune response and also indicated the superiority of alum precipitated oil adjuvant vaccine over the currently available toxoid and alum precipitated <b>enterotoxaemia</b> vaccines.

40|$|A simple {{mathematical}} model has been formulated to assess the losses due to a disease in goats in India. The losses due to important diseases in goats have been computed for a 15 -year period (1991 - 2005) based on published reports. The rank analysis has revealed that number of incidence was maximum for PPR, followed by FMD and sheep and goat pox. These three diseases have accounted for 54 per cent of the total incidences. The maximum deaths on per year average basis for the period 1991 - 2005 {{have been due to}} PPR, followed by sheep and goat pox, <b>enterotoxaemia</b> and CCP. These four diseases have accounted for about 74 per cent of deaths. The overall order with respect to the number of incidences has been found as: PPR > FMD > sheep and goat pox > CCP > fascioliasis / distomatosis > <b>enterotoxaemia</b> > anthrax. The corresponding ranking order with respect to number of deaths was: PPR > sheep and goat pox > <b>enterotoxaemia</b> > CCP > anthrax > fascioliasis / distomatosis > FMD. The total annual average loss due to all diseases in goats has been found of Rs 264. 8 lakh. The PPR disease has accounted for the maximum (34. 5 %) loss, followed by FMD (14. 3 %), sheep and goat pox (14. 1 %), CCP (6. 4 %), <b>enterotoxaemia</b> (6. 1 %), facioliasis / distomatosis (5. 0 %) and anthrax (2. 0 %).

Pure and mixed cultures of four C perfringens (one alpha+beta 2 +, one alpha+enterotoxin- 1 and two alpha+) were tested in the ligated loop assay in one calf. Macroscopic haemorrhages of the intestinal wall, necrosis and haemorrhages of the intestinal content, and microscopic lesions of necrosis and polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell infiltration of the intestinal villi were more pronounced in loops inoculated with the a and beta 2 -toxigenic C. perfringens isolate.

40|$|<b>Enterotoxaemia</b> is an {{economically}} important disease of sheep, goats and calves. The disease affects mainly young animals aged between {{four to six}} months. <b>Enterotoxaemia</b> is caused by systemic effects of the epsilon toxin produced by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium perfringens Type D. Due to almost certain death of affected animals, there is no form of treatment. The only practical means of controlling the occurrence of <b>enterotoxaemia</b> is to immunize animals through vaccination. The vaccine is prepared by toxoiding the bacterial culture filtrate, and contains a range of proteins {{in addition to the}} epsilon toxin. Batches of the vaccine are thus required to be tested for safety, efficacy and potency. The potency of the vaccines is currently tested with the in vivo mouse neutralisation test (MNT). However, due to ethical, economic and technical reasons, alternative in vitro assays are needed. In this study, an indirect cytometric bead immunoassay (I-CBA) was developed for use in vaccine potency testing and the results were compared with those obtained using an indirect ELISA (I-ELISA) and the MNT. To investigate, three groups of eight guinea pigs were immunized with one of three different production batches of the <b>enterotoxaemia</b> vaccine. Guinea pig sera were collected prior to vaccination and at five weeks post-vaccination, and the sera of four guinea pigs per group were pooled to give six test sera. The levels of anti-epsilon toxin antibodies in the respective test sera were subsequently determined using MNT, I-ELISA and I-CBA. The I-CBA assay developed {{during the course of this}} study is based on coating of functional beads with purified epsilon toxin that serves to capture anti-epsilon toxin antibodies from the test sera. Following incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -labelled anti-guinea pig IgG, the samples were analyzed by flow cytometry and the anti-epsilon toxin antibody concentrations were extrapolated from a standard curve using linear curve fitting. Although the intra- and inter-assay variability was satisfactory, epsilon antitoxin levels of the guinea pig test sera determined by both the ICBA and I-ELISA tests were higher than that of the MNT assay which is accepted as the current “gold standard”. Moreover, in contrast to the MNT, all of the serum samples were identified as having antitoxin levels above the required minimum (i. e. not less than 5 U/ml).

An increase in the epsilon antibody titre occurred in each of the 2 studies after the animals were passively immunized with immunoglobulin, though this increase was not statistically significant (P> 0, 05). In the 3 rd study, when the animals were given the initial vaccination of the Onderstepoort <b>enterotoxaemia</b> oil adjuvant vaccine together with the immunoglobulin, an immediate increase in the epsilon antitoxin titre occurred that was statistically significant (P< 0, 05) 2 - 14 days after administration. No negative effects were noted on the development of an initial active immunity or an existing active immunity against Clostridium perfringens type D when they were passively immunized with partially purified immunoglobulin.

40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} produces enteric diseases, generically called <b>enterotoxaemia,</b> in sheep, goats, {{and other}} animals. The {{objective of this}} work is to conduct a preliminary study for diagnosis of Clostridium perfringens among camel-calf (Camelusdromedarius). A total of 200 fecal samples were collected from camel calve with sings of diarrhea and 120 small intestine (70 from the central slaughter house and 50 after postmortem examination of suddenly dead camel calves). All samples were evaluated by culture for C. perfringens. Cultivation of fecal samples on SFP agar revealed the isolation of 45 C. perfringens isolates from fecal samples and 16 isolates from intestinal contents collected after postmortem examination of dead animals and 14 isolates from intestinal contents of apparently healthy animals. All bacterial isolates exhibited the characteristic features of C. perfringens. Results of pathogenicity test in white mice revealed that out of 75 C. perfringens isolates; 16 (21. 33 %) were non-pathogenic for mice. Isolates were analyzed by multiplex PCR in order to detect {{the presence of the}} toxin genes of C. perfringens. Of these isolates, 25 (33. 33 %) were type A, 4 (5. 3 %), were type A ß 2, 4 (5. 3 %), were type B, 13 (17. 33 %) were type C, 13 (17. 33 %) were type D and 16 (21. 33 %) non- pathogenic. In conclusion, C. perfringens type A is the predominant type among camel calves in Al Hasa region, KSA. Its recommended that a vaccination schedule should be implemented to reduce the <b>enterotoxaemia</b> in camel calves...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Mortality and {{morbidity}} {{are hardly}} {{documented in the}} white veal industry, despite high levels of antimicrobial drug use and resistance. The objective {{of the present study}} was to determine the causes and epidemiology of morbidity and mortality in dairy, beef and crossbred white veal production. A total of 5853 calves, housed in 15 production cohorts, were followed during one production cycle. Causes of mortality were determined by necropsy. Morbidity was daily recorded by the producers. Results The total mortality risk was 5, 3 % and was significantly higher in beef veal production compared to dairy or crossbreds. The main causes of mortality were pneumonia (1. 3 % of the calves at risk), ruminal disorders (0. 7 %), idiopathic peritonitis (0. 5 %), <b>enterotoxaemia</b> (0. 5 %) and enteritis (0. 4 %). Belgian Blue beef calves were more likely to die from pneumonia, <b>enterotoxaemia</b> and arthritis. Detection of bovine viral diarrhea virus at necropsy was associated with chronic pneumonia and pleuritis. Of the calves, 25. 4 % was treated individually and the morbidity rate was 1. 66 cases per 1000 calf days at risk. The incidence rate of respiratory disease, diarrhea, arthritis and otitis was 0. 95, 0. 30, 0. 11 and 0. 07 cases per 1000 calf days at risk respectively. Morbidity peaked in the first three weeks after arrival and gradually declined towards the end of the production cycle. Conclusions The present study provided insights into the causes and epidemiology of morbidity and mortality in white veal calves in Belgium, housed in the most frequent housing system in Europe. The necropsy findings, identified risk periods and differences between production systems can guide both veterinarians and producers towards the most profitable and ethical preventive and therapeutic protocols. </p...|$|E
40|$|Various {{aspects of}} the safety of {{moxidectin}} for goats were tested in six experiments, where two pharmaceutical forms (1 % injectable solution and 0. 1 % oral drench) of the drug were used. In experiments I and II, the drug was administered to adult goats or to kids in the following doses: 300, 600, 900 and 2 x 300 mug kg(- 1). In experiments III and IV, the drug was administered to goats before and during pregnancy in the dose of 300 mug kg(- 1). In experiments V and VI, the drug was administered to goats concurrently with an <b>enterotoxaemia</b> vaccine or with a flukicide in the dose of 300 mug kg(- 1). An increased (P < 0. 05) prevalence of animals with adverse reactions was recorded among adult goats, which received 900 mug kg(- 1) of moxidectin 1 % injectable solution and among kids which received 600 or 900 mug kg(- 1) of moxidectin 1 % injectable solution or 900 mug kg(- 1) moxidectin 0. 1 % oral drench. The salient reactions of the animals were: indifference to the environment, drowsiness, somnolence, salivation, ataxia and refusal of kids to suck their dams; they were observed 4 - 8 h after administration of the drug and regressed within 36 h after it. No other statistically significant adverse reactions were observed among experimental animals; no adverse reproductive effects were recorded; no effects were observed during simultaneous administration of the <b>enterotoxaemia</b> vaccine or the flukicide. It is concluded that although the drug appears to be safe for use to goats {{of all ages and}} reproductive stages, care should be taken to avoid inadverted overdosing. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.
