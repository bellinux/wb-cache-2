25|$|The {{founding}} of France's other <b>great</b> <b>wine</b> regions {{is not as}} clear. The Romans' propensity for planting on hillsides has left archaeological evidence of Gallo-Roman vineyards in the chalk hillsides of Sancerre. In the 4th century, the Emperor Julian had a vineyard near Paris on the hill of Montmartre, and a 5th-century villa {{in what is now}} Épernay shows the Roman influence in the Champagne region.|$|E
25|$|This narrow {{valley of}} the Danube around Melk is {{reminiscent}} of the <b>great</b> <b>wine</b> areas of the Rhine, with steep terraces that produce world-class Grüner Veltliner and Riesling wines. Climatically and geologically it marks the transition from the Alps to the Hungarian plains, leading to a diverse array of microclimates and terroir, with the river moderating the effects of the cold Alpine winds. As mentioned above, the Vinea Wachau Nobilis Districtus still clings to its own classification of Steinfeder, Federspiel and Smaragd, reserved for wines that are made 100% from Wachau grapes.|$|E
2500|$|Before the 1950s, the {{traditional}} European wine {{was made in}} small containers where the temperature did not rise high enough {{to interfere with the}} fermentation but this method of vinification gave wine structure and roundness but was not aromatic. In California and Australia the need to cool the grapes and wine during fermentation led winemakers to equip their cellars with adequate equipment: refrigeration units, circuits of pipes to carry the liquid refrigerant, and vats temperature-regulated by coils in the walls of the vessel or flag (a thin welded coil shaped like a flat plate with a high heat exchange capability). This mode of production happened in Europe {{at the same time as}} new techniques of treatment of the must (accelerated settling, use of selected yeasts, addition of glues and yeast enzymes, the practice of maceration). In wine jargon, all of these practices give a [...] "technological wine". This is very fragrant, crisp on the palate, and does not require ageing. The [...] "old" [...] type of European white wines were well suited to this type of wine – it was the Sauvignon B grape varietal that was first used in this manner which allowed it to be blended with Semillon B. There has also been a decrease in growing areas in the last thirty years. In Burgundy these practices may face the phenomenon of premature oxidation. Chardonnay is the archetype of the <b>great</b> <b>wine</b> that can be produced with old-fashioned methods.|$|E

I have sent them home for a time to have quiet and rest, which they need after their exertions, and have done this the more willingly since there is no chance of fighting for many months to come.
