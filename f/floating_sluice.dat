500|$|The Rother Levels Acts {{were two}} Acts of Parliament which were {{obtained}} in 1826 and 1830. The Commissioners of the Rother Levels were obliged by the acts {{to ensure that}} navigation between Scots Float and Bodiam Bridge was possible, and that all bridges provided at least [...] of headroom. They also enshrined the principle {{that it was a}} free river, and no tolls were to be collected for its use. The Rennie brothers, John and George, who had taken over from their father on his death in 1821, produced two reports on the river in 1830, as it was difficult to navigate and prone to flooding. They were critical {{of the way in which}} tidal water was allowed to enter the river through Scots <b>Float</b> <b>Sluice,</b> and thought that the river channel was too circuitous, which resulted in shoals forming. The Rennie brothers also criticised the angles at which bridges crossed the channel. William Cubitt and James Elliott rebuilt Scots <b>Float</b> <b>Sluice</b> in 1844.|$|R
500|$|The river {{has been}} used for {{navigation}} since Roman times, and is still navigable by small boats as far as Bodiam Castle. It flowed in a loop around the northern edge of the Isle of Oxney until 1635, when it was diverted along the southern edge. Scots <b>Float</b> <b>Sluice</b> was built before 1723, when the engineer John Reynolds made repairs to it, and later extended it, to try to keep the channel clear of silting, but it was criticised by John Rennie in 1804, as it was inconvenient to shipping. The river became part of a defensive line to protect England from the threat of invasion by the French in the early 1800s, when its lower section and part of the River Brede formed a link between the two halves of the Royal Military Canal. Scots <b>Float</b> <b>Sluice</b> was again rebuilt in 1844. Some [...] of the valley were inundated by floodwater in 1960, which resulted in the Rother Area Drainage Improvement Scheme being implemented between 1966 and 1980. The river banks were raised, and 20 pumping stations were installed.|$|R
5|$|Iden Lock {{connected}} the Royal Military Canal to the river. The last commercial barge to pass from the Rother through Iden lock onto the canal was the Vulture, carrying 27 tons of shingle on 15 December 1909. After that, the lock {{was replaced by}} a sluice, severing the navigable connection. The river was used by pleasure craft in Edwardian times, when regular boat trips from Scots <b>Float</b> <b>Sluice,</b> then called Star Lock, to Bodiam Castle were offered. The lower river is currently used for moorings, and the Bodiam Ferry Company operate a trip boat from Newenden Bridge to Bodiam Castle.|$|R
500|$|Vessels used on {{the river}} were Rye sailing barges, which were about [...] in size, with a draught of [...] A {{pamphlet}} published in 1802 announced that there were 16 barges operating on the river, whereas there had only been three some ten years earlier. The main cargoes were manure, fuel and roadstone, and the places served by the river were listed as Appledore, Reading Street, Maytham Wharf, Newenden, Bodiam and Small Hythe. Boats also worked along part of the Newmill Channel towards Tenterden. The river {{did not have a}} towing path, and the boats were bow-hauled by men. Scots <b>Float</b> <b>Sluice</b> was descripted as being [...] "very inconvenient and ill-adapted to the present vessels which navigate the Rother" [...] by the civil engineer John Rennie in 1804.|$|R
500|$|The River Rother flows for [...] {{through the}} English {{counties}} of East Sussex and Kent. Its source is near Rotherfield in East Sussex, and its mouth is on Rye Bay, {{part of the}} English Channel. Prior to 1287, its mouth was further to the east at New Romney, but it changed its course after a great storm blocked its exit to the sea. It {{was known as the}} Limen until the sixteenth century.

50|$|The River Rother flows for 35 mi {{through the}} English {{counties}} of East Sussex and Kent. Its source is near Rotherfield in East Sussex, and its mouth is on Rye Bay, {{part of the}} English Channel. Prior to 1287, its mouth was further to the east at New Romney, but it changed its course after a great storm blocked its exit to the sea. It {{was known as the}} Limen until the sixteenth century. For the final 14 mi, the river bed is below the high tide level, and Scots <b>Float</b> <b>sluice</b> is used to control levels. It prevents salt water entering the river system at high tides, and retains water in the river during the summer months to ensure the health of the surrounding marsh habitat.

5|$|In 1723, the Commissioners of the Kent and Sussex Rother Levels {{employed}} the civil engineering contractor John Reynolds to make repairs to Scots <b>Float</b> <b>Sluice,</b> a timber {{lock on the}} lower river. He built a dovetailed sheet pile wall below the foundations, and the Commissioners offered him the job of maintaining the levels in 1725, for which he would be paid Â£65 per year. He moved to Iden and held the post for fourteen years. Silting of the river estuary caused mounting problems with the drainage of the levels during the 1720s. Reynolds carried out further work on the sluice in 1729, and in 1732 reconstructed it to provide an extra outlet. Several new channels were excavated through the levels in the early 1730s, {{so that all the}} runoff passed through Scots Float. Reynolds resigned his post in 1739 as he was too busy with other engineering projects.|$|R
500|$|Scots <b>Float</b> <b>sluice,</b> some [...] {{from the}} mouth of the river, is used to control levels. It is named for Sir John Scot(t), who {{enlarged}} a harbour on the site around 1480. The river below it is tidal, and it is closed as the tide rises, to prevent salt water passing up the river. During dry years, the sluice may be kept closed for most of the summer, as the water is used to maintain the marsh environment. A navigation lock bypasses the sluice. If heavy rainfall coincides with a high tide, where outflow is tide-locked, the river above the sluice to Bodiam acts as a huge holding reservoir for flood water, and is managed as such. In times of high flow, water is also pumped from the river into Darwell Reservoir, which can hold 167 million cubic feet (4728 Ml) of water. It covers an area of [...] and was built between 1937 and 1949. Since the 1980s, its output has been taken by pipeline to Beauport Park, from where it provides a public water supply for Hastings.|$|R
5|$|When {{repairs to}} Craven Sluices were {{necessary}} in 1684, {{the water was}} temporarily diverted into Scots Float Channel. This worked well, and a regulating penn was built, so that water could be routed to Craven <b>Sluices</b> or Scots <b>Float.</b> Knock <b>Sluice</b> was built below the Appledore Sluice in 1686, and land above it was reclaimed. In 1696, New Knock Sluice was built, close to Craven Sluices, and the sea was finally excluded from the Wittersham Levels.|$|R
40|$|The Melton Valley Storage Tanks (MVSTs) and the {{evaporator}} service tanks at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) {{are used}} for the collection and storage of liquid low-level waste (LLLW). Wastes collected in these tanks are typically acidic when generated and are neutralized with sodium hydroxide to protect the tanks from corrosion; however, the high pH of the solution causes the formation of insoluble compounds that precipitate. These precipitates formed a sludge layer approximately 0. 6 to 1. 2 m (2 to 4 ft) deep {{in the bottom of}} the tanks. The sludge in the MVSTs and the evaporator service tanks will eventually need to be removed from the tanks and treated for final disposal or transferred to another storage facility. The primary options for removing the sludge include single-point sluicing, use of a <b>floating</b> pump, robotic <b>sluicing,</b> and submerged-nozzle sluicing. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the feasibility of submerged-nozzle sluicing in horizontal cylindrical tanks and (2) obtain experimental data to validate the TEMPEST (time-dependent, energy, momentun, pressure, equation solution in three dimensions) computer code...|$|R
