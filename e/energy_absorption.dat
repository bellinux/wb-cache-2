25|$|Gamma {{spectroscopy}} detectors are passive {{materials that}} {{wait for a}} gamma interaction {{to occur in the}} detector volume. The most important interaction mechanisms are the photoelectric effect, the Compton effect, and pair production. The photoelectric effect is preferred, as it absorbs all of the energy of the incident gamma ray. Full <b>energy</b> <b>absorption</b> is also possible when a series of these interaction mechanisms take place within the detector volume. When a gamma ray undergoes a Compton interaction or pair production, and a portion of the energy escapes from the detector volume without being absorbed, the background rate in the spectrum is increased by one count. This count will appear in a channel below the channel that corresponds to the full energy of the gamma ray. Larger detector volumes reduce this effect.|$|E
25|$|Uneven heating in microwaved {{food can}} be {{partly due to}} the uneven {{distribution}} of microwave energy inside the oven, and {{partly due to the}} different rates of <b>energy</b> <b>absorption</b> {{in different parts of the}} food. The first problem is reduced by a stirrer, a type of fan that reflects microwave energy to different parts of the oven as it rotates, or by a turntable or carousel that turns the food; turntables, however, may still leave spots, such as the center of the oven, which receive uneven energy distribution. The location of dead spots and hot spots in a microwave can be mapped out by placing a damp piece of thermal paper in the oven. When the water saturated paper is subjected to the microwave radiation it becomes hot enough to cause the dye to be released which will provide a visual representation of the microwaves. If multiple layers of paper are constructed in the oven with a sufficient distance between them a three-dimensional map can be created. Many store receipts are printed on thermal paper which allows this to be easily done at home.|$|E

There are two important parameters are used during the composite fabrications namely fiber orientations (00, 50 and 100) and number of layers (1, 2 and 3 layers). These composite tubes are crushed axially and forces versus displacement curves are recorded. Then, the specific <b>energy</b> <b>absorptions</b> and force ratios are determined. As expected, increasing the number of layers increased the specific <b>energy</b> <b>absorptions</b> but it is not significantly affected the force ratio even different fiber orientations are used.

2500|$|The {{focus of}} {{preventive}} measures {{to date has}} been on the design of car seats, primarily through the introduction of head restraints, often called headrests. This approach is potentially problematic given the underlying assumption that purely mechanical factors cause whiplash injuries — an unproven theory. So far the injury reducing effects of head restraints appears to have been low, approximately 5–10%, because car seats have become stiffer in order to increase crashworthiness [...] of cars in high-speed rear-end collisions which in turn could increase the risk of whiplash injury in low-speed rear impact collisions. Improvements in the geometry of car seats through better design and <b>energy</b> <b>absorption</b> could offer additional benefits.

The numerical simulations were conducted using the finite element code of LS-DYNA. The effect of fin wall imperfection was assessed through the fin wall bending and bulging. The numerical homogenization of the single layer corrugated structure was performed using MAT 26 honeycomb material model. The buckling stress of single- and double-layer corrugated sandwich structures increased when the strain rate increased. The increased buckling stresses were ascribed to the micro inertial effects. The initial buckling stress at quasi-static and high strain rate was numerically shown to be imperfection sensitive. Increasing the number of core layers decreased the buckling stress and increased the densification strain.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} the optical absorption of small silicon nanocrystals (Si-NCs) embedded in silicon dioxide is performed using real-time time-dependent density-functional theory. The modeled Si-NCs contain up to 47 Si atoms with the surrounding oxide being described by a shell of SiO 2. The oxide-embedded Si-NCs exhibit absorption spectra that differ significantly from the spectra of the hydrogen-passivated Si-NCs. In particular, the minimum <b>absorption</b> <b>energy</b> is found to decrease when the Si-NCs are exposed to dioxide coating. Unexpectedly, the <b>absorption</b> <b>energy</b> of the oxide-embedded Si-NCs remains approximately constant for core sizes down to 17 atoms, whereas the <b>absorption</b> <b>energy</b> of the hydrogen-passivated Si-NCs increases with decreasing crystal size.
