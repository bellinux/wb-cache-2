Robinson claims that she worked for the show for 11 days in 2013 as an errand runner, which is when she allegedly experienced the harassment. In her lawsuit, Robinson claimed that Peck stated: [...] "Now Nickie can go home and suck some d***s." [...] She stated that Peck tickled her against her, squeezed her and pinched her against her will. Robinson also claimed Peck pulled her seatbelt tight against her breasts while she was driving. Robinson claimed that Nuñez stated: [...] "Are you menstruating? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> hug?" [...] She also {{goes on to say}} that Nuñez once asked her if she was [...] "knocked up" [...] because she was sick, and that he once explicitly described how his partner's dirty underwear was eaten by their dog. Robinson claimed that both Peck and Nuñez would regularly make offensive comments in her presence, including derogative comments about other women and once calling another judge a [...] "faggot."Robinson allegedly complained to supervisors, who, according to her, replaced Robinson, yet said her employment would continue on the production, then never called her back. She sued for sexual harassment and unlawful retaliation.|$|E

5000|$|Wright and Mrs. Mossberg {{had a great}} {{appreciation}} for one another which resulted in Wright breaking some of his famous rules {{in the design of}} this house. One of the hallmarks of an Usonian house was that the smallish, windowless kitchens that Wright called the [...] "workspace" [...] were normally placed {{at the center of the}} house, with a ceiling higher than the rest, to allow cooking odors to rise, rather than to drift into the rest of the house. Wright's first design for the Mossbergs had such a kitchen. When she saw it, Mrs. Mossberg expressed her dismay that the kitchen had no windows. This was a common aspect in the Usonian house designs. For example, a window was added in the Robert Levin House despite Wright's wishes, and he never signed the house. A similar expression of dismay from one of the Kalamazoo clients at about this same time had resulted in Wright imperiously rolling up his drawings and saying, [...] "Madam, you are not worthy of a Frank Lloyd Wright home." [...] That couple was left with the problem of finding a new architect. But in Mrs. Mossberg's case, things went differently. [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> window in your kitchen?" [...] asked Wright. [...] "Why, Mr. Wright, to see my birds," [...] Mrs. Mossberg replied. [...] "Well then, you shall have your window," [...] Wright responded. And in fact, the Mossberg house as built has a large bank of French doors in the kitchen, looking directly into the back yard. Wright was also famous for having eliminated basements from his residential designs. The Mossberg house has a basement, again, at Mrs. Mossberg's request.|$|E

Database systems and practice have developed to satisfy <b>an</b> organization's critical <b>needs</b> for operational data. A database management system (DBMS) is supposed to make it easy to share and protect vital data and information. The designers of such systems are charged to get all the right information into the system, make it easy for multiple sub-organizations to get at it and, yet, prevent the wrong eyes from seeing the parts of it they have no right to. DBMSs are further charged to make sure that a minimum of crucial information is ever lost by accident or disaster, or is destroyed by miscreants. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
