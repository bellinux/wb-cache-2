50|$|Laboratory hydrogenolysis is operationally {{similar to}} hydrogenation, {{and may be}} {{accomplished}} at atmospheric pressure by stirring the reaction mixture under a slight positive pressure of hydrogen gas, having flushed the apparatus with more of this gas. The hydrogen may be provided by attaching a balloon to a needle, filling it from a bottle, and inserting the needle into the reaction flask via a rubber septum. At high pressure, a hydrogenation autoclave (i.e., a Parr <b>hydrogenator)</b> or similar piece of equipment is required.|$|E

This was resolved {{with the use of}} flow chemistry. With no associated scale up issues, a method was devised to produce norcantharidin, along with acid-ester and acid-amide analogues on any scale necessary for biological screening...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was}} {{development}} of a computerized information-measuring system for measuring the air gap in the <b>hydrogenator,</b> which used two capacitive sensors with parallel coplanar electrodes, and the method of determining the shape of the envelope parameters hydrogenerator rotor poles relative to the center axis of rotation, using the measurement results of the air gap. In practical studies of the sensor circuit {{it has been shown that}} its use allows for the informative value of the sensor capacitance conversion function to obtain a high accuracy and resolution measurement with digital linearization of converting function of the sensor with use program utility. To determine the form deviations of the envelope line of the rotor pole from the ideal cylinder, which is one of the main structural defects of the technological errors as results the distortion of the shape of the air gap in the <b>hydrogenator,</b> when the machine was manufacture and assembly. It is proposed to describe the shape of the envelope to use a Fourier transform. Calculation of the coefficients of the Fourier series is performed using the method of least squares as the regression coefficients. Application of this method in processing the measuring data in a computerized information-measuring system the developed with the primary converter with coplanar parallel electrodes allowed attaining the high measurement accuracy and resolution informative in magnitude of the capacity. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of the ThalesNano H-Cube &# 174;, a commercial packed bed flow <b>hydrogenator,</b> was evaluated {{in the context of}} small scale reaction screening and optimization. A model reaction, the reduction of styrene to ethylbenzene through a 10 % Pd/C catalyst bed, was used to examine performance at various pressure settings, over sequential runs, and with commercial catalyst cartridges. In addition, the consistency of the hydrogen flow was indirectly measured by in-line UV spectroscopy. Finally, system contamination due to catalyst leaching, and the resolution of this issue, is described. The impact of these factors on the run-to-run reproducibility of the H-Cube &# 174; reactor for screening and reaction optimization is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of notches and other stress concentrations in turbine blades and other notch hydraulic components is a current problem in engineering. It causes {{a reduction of}} endurance limit of material. In that sense, specimens of the ASTM A 743 CA 6 NM alloy steel using in several <b>hydrogenator</b> turbine components was tested. The specimens were tested under uniaxial fatigue loading with a load ratio equal to - 1, and the considered stress concentration factors, Kt, values, calculated with respect to net area, were 1. 55, 2. 04 and 2. 42. In {{order to determine the}} fatigue limit for such notch type, a reduction data method by Dixon and Mood, Staircase method was used. This approach is based on the assumed target distribution of the fatigue limit. For such geometry at least 8 specimens were tested. In addition, the Peterson and Neuber’s notch fatigue factor were compared through fatigue notch reduction factor, Kf, obtained from experimental data. According to results obtained it was possible to conclude that the tested material is less sensitive to notches than the prediction of the Peterson and Neuber’s empirical models...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to evaluate the effects of mean stress on the fatigue behavior of ASTM A 743 CA 6 NM alloy steel. It is used in several <b>hydrogenator</b> turbine components. In order to achieve it, 33 specimens were experimentally evaluated under axial loads with stress ratio of - 1 and more 60 specimens were tested under stress ratio 0, 1 / 3 and 2 / 3. Based on the obtained results {{it was possible to}} determine parameters that describe the fatigue behavior of the evaluated material, obtain its S-N curves, its endurance limit and its scatter bands. In the assessment of the mean stress effects of fatigue life, Goodman, Gerber, Walker and Kwofie’s relations were tested in order to evaluate the validity of the use of such rules for the tested material. According to the obtained results it was possible to verify that Goodman and Gerber’s relations do not model correctly the reduction effect fatigue life and presented high scatter. The predictions of Walker and Kwofie’s relation are consistent and the Walker’s relation presented smaller scatter than Kwofie’s relation. Walker’s relation makes it possible to evaluate in a consistent way the effect of the presence of mean stresses on fatigue strength...|$|E
