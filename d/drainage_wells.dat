50|$|The wells {{are placed}} {{at such a}} {{distance}} apart that the individual collecting areas of the microdrains, appertaining to each well, are overlaid. In this way all {{the volume of the}} slope involved with the water table is drained. Medium-diameter <b>drainage</b> <b>wells</b> linked at the bottom. The technique involves the dry cutting with temporary sheathing pipes, of aligned <b>drainage</b> <b>wells,</b> with a diameter of 1200-1500 mm., positioned at an interaxis of 6-8 m., their bottoms linked together to a bottom tube for the discharge of drained water. In this way the water discharge takes place passively, due to gravity by perforated pipes with mini-tubes, positioned {{at the bottom of the}} wells themselves. The linking pipes, generally made of steel, are blind in the linking length and perforated or windowed in the length corresponding to the well. The wells have a concrete bung at the bottom and are filled, after withdrawal of the temporary sheathing pipe, with dry draining material and are closed with an impermeable clay bung.|$|E
50|$|Flooding in {{open pit}} mines {{leads to the}} {{so-called}} pit lakes, where {{a wide range of}} creatures can be seen. The flooding process happens because the <b>drainage</b> <b>wells</b> or dewatering pumps stop to work and the open mining spaces are filled with groundwaters and surface waters. Surface waters come from precipitation and water bodies (e.g. rivers) and groundwaters come from bodies connected to the pit or from abandoned underground mine workings.|$|E

Their effectiveness is due to the extensiveness of the area to be drained. Moreover, these drainage systems must be installed on the stable part of the slope.|$|E

50|$|In normal conditions, these wells reach a {{depth of}} 20-30 m, but, in {{especially}} favourable cases, may reach 50 m. Some of these wells have drainage functions across their whole section and others can be inspected. The latter serve for maintenance of the whole drainage screen. Such wells that can be inspected are also a support point {{for the creation of}} new <b>drainage</b> <b>wells</b> and access for the installation, also on a later occasion, for a range of sub-horizontal drains at the bottom or along the walls of the wells themselves, with the purpose of increasing the drainage capacity of the well.|$|E

Large-capacity cesspools are also Class V wells, but they are banned in Arkansas under authority of the ADH. There are approximately 136 Class V wells that are permitted by ADEQ and 74 bromine wells permitted by AOGC (Linda Hanson, Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality, oral commun., 2013; Rex Robertson, Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission, oral commun., 2013).|$|E

50|$|La Campana section {{explored}} {{in the first}} season (1995) {{is located in a}} square with a network of decanting <b>drainage</b> <b>wells</b> to dislodge rainwater. It includes Structures 1 consisting of overlaid platforms, in the front, a stairway adorned with stone cubes, resembling a wall (alfarda). At the top is a large structure; inside has circles that define wells, probably used to stored grains and ashes of important people, perhaps priests or warriors killed in battle. In the center is a pyramid altar; its architectural features make it the only building erected on three stepped platforms, the sloped shape resembles the silhouette of the Fuego Volcano, which is assumed was an important cult object at the time.

5000|$|Subsurface {{drainage}} {{of groundwater}} {{can also be}} accomplished by pumped wells (vertical drainage, in contrast to horizontal drainage). <b>Drainage</b> <b>wells</b> have been used extensively in the Salinity Control and Reclamation Program (SCARP) in the Indus valley of Pakistan. Although the experiences were not overly successful, the feasibility of this technique in areas with deep and permeable aquifers {{is not to be}} discarded. The well spacings in these areas can be so wide (more than 1000m) that the installation of vertical drainage systems could be relatively cheap compared to horizontal subsurface drainage (drainage by pipes, ditches, trenches, at a spacing of 100m or less). For the design of a well field for control of the water table, the WellDrain model [...] may be helpful.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{technique}} conceived and developed in France, which works like the system of isolated <b>drainage</b> <b>wells</b> but overcoming the inconvenience of installing a pump for each well. Once motion is triggered in the siphon tube, without the entry of air into the loop, {{the flow of water}} is uninterrupted. For this reason, the two ends of the siphon tube are submerged in the water of two permanent storage tanks. This drain is created vertically starting from the campaign level but can also be sub-vertical or inclined. The diameter of the well can vary from 100 to 300 mm;. Inside a PVC pipe is placed or a perforated or microperforated steel pipe, filled with draining material. The siphon drain in this way carries off drainage water by gravity without the need for drainage pumps or pipes linking the bottom of each well. This system proves to be economically advantageous and relatively simple to set up, but requires a programme of controls and maintenance.|$|E

50|$|EPA {{regulations}} define six {{classes of}} injection wells. Class I wells {{are used for}} the injection of municipal and industrial wastes beneath underground sources of drinking water. Class II wells are used for the injection of fluids associated with oil and gas production, including waste from hydraulic fracturing. Class III wells are used for the injection of fluids used in mineral solution mining beneath underground sources of drinking water. Class IV wells, like Class I wells, {{were used for the}} injection of hazardous wastes but inject waste into or above underground sources of drinking water instead of below. EPA banned the use of Class IV wells in 1984. Class V wells are those used for all non-hazardous injections that are not covered by Classes I through IV. Examples of Class V wells include stormwater <b>drainage</b> <b>wells</b> and septic system leach fields. Finally, Class VI wells are used for the injection of carbon dioxide for sequestration, or long term storage. Currently, there are no Class VI wells in operation, but 6 to 10 wells are expected to be in use by 2016.|$|E

40|$|Productive {{farming in}} parts of the Midwest depends upon {{agricultural}} <b>drainage</b> <b>wells</b> to maintain favorable soil moisture levels. These wells channel water and, it is hypothesized, chemical pollutants into aquifers. The number of functioning wells is not known, nor is their spatial distribution, although they are apparently clustered in areas with poor drainage. Current evidence indicates groundwater contamination occurring only at local levels. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources has recommended phasing out these wells through various incentive programs. As part of a larger project, a survey questionnaire was developed to elicit opinions from 100 groundwater experts {{on how to deal with}} <b>drainage</b> <b>wells.</b> Results demonstrated some of the complexities of implementing environmental policies based on incomplete information. The consensus was toward greater controls, although appropriate strategies to be adopted and sources of funding for implementing management policies were open to debate.

This was accomplished using maximum capacity tests, correlation of lithologic features between wells and comparing void density to depth below the land surface. It was only possible to develop general trends in the areal distribution of voids throughout the city, hence: specific optimal areas for removal of storm water runoff could not be differentiated. The correlation of voids between wells was possible alone both the regional dip and strike of the beds.

40|$|Mine {{drainage}} is {{a necessary}} but very costly precaution for open-pit lignite mining in sandy aquifers. Consequently, the minimization {{of the number of}} <b>drainage</b> <b>wells</b> and their optimal operation become important tasks in designing mine drainage systems. Comprehensive groundwater flow models have to be used, both, for the design of <b>drainage</b> <b>wells,</b> and for the analysis of water management strategies in mining areas. The accuracy of computations with such models depends on the precision of the underlying hydrogeological informations. In order to get these informations detailed and costly hydrogeological explorations have {{to be done in the}} mining regions. The basic informations are obtained using exploration drilling. The cost for hydrogeological exploration are approximately a linear function of the number of exploration bore holes. Therefore the reduction of drilling gets a key role in reducing costs of exploration. This might be done by: - increased use of geophysical exploration methods, - complex analysis of exploration results using mathematical statistical methods, - precise estimation of the required amount of hydrogeological informations. The paper describes a mathematical approach to support the complex decision making procedure of estimating the optimal amount of hydrogeological exploration with respect to a given mine drainage goal...|$|E

A jet-slotting tool was used to cut four vertical slots through the casing about 1 ft below the coalbed. Even though stimulation treatment pressure was excessive, hydraulically induced channels were contained entirely within the target coal zone. Sand-filled, induced channels were horizontal, inclined, and vertical, and were propagated in directions similar to bedding planes, rock joint, and coal cleat directions measured in the mine. Variable gas flow rates, recorded during the productive life of the well, were attributed to chronic downhole pump malfunction and the slotted casing below the production zone.
