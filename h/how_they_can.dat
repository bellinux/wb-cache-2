5|$|In season 5, Claire's {{story begins}} as {{the opening scene}} of the season: {{shooting}} a propaganda commercial in order to stir up fear. Throughout the beginning, she helps make the campaign's focal point about {{the fear of the}} terrorist Islamic Caliphate Organization (ICO, a fictionalized version of ISIS/ISIL) and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> stop the threat.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been argued against folk {{psychology}} that the intentionality of mental states like belief imply that they have semantic qualities.

Turk exits with Isabella, and Elliot expresses concern that J.D. thinks he's moving into the house with her. Carla has decided to take one year parental leave, and Laverne, Ted, and The Worthless Peons wonder <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> go on at the hospital without Carla's help ("Gonna Miss You, Carla"). Carla begins {{to realize that she}} does not want to separate herself from her work for so long.|$|E

5|$|Caregivers use {{language}} {{to help children}} become competent members of society and culture. From birth, infants receive pragmatic information. They learn structure of conversations from early interactions with caregivers. Actions and speech are organized in games, such as peekaboo to provide children with information about words and phrases. Caregivers find many ways to help infants interact and respond. As children advance and participate more actively in interactions, caregivers adapt their interactions accordingly. Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about what children are expected to say, how to speak, when they should speak, and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> stay on topic. Caregivers may model the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} now under a rector, who {{replaced}} the lay abbot; and any remaining priests of the clas and their abod were presumably expelled. If one accepts {{the evidence of}} the inquisition taken before Rhys ap Gruffydd, lieutenant of the Justiciar, at Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn, 1 September 1326 (which conflicts with Gerald's account), as early as 1212 there were apparently only two monks (from St Peter's, Gloucester) in residence. However, {{it is difficult to see}} <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> have remained, in light of Welsh control of the area; possibly they had only arrived in 1211; we don't know whether there was a priest resident (one of the monks might have been a priest).|$|E
5|$|The game's story follows {{bounty hunter}} Samus Aran, who is {{sent by the}} Galactic Federation to {{investigate}} the Biologic Space Laboratories space station, where it is swarming with organisms infected with virions known as the X Parasites. Like in previous Metroid games, Fusion is played from the side-scrolling perspective. It introduces mission-based gameplay that aids the player to explore areas. The game consists of objectives, which are flexible in <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be accomplished. Fusion was released simultaneously with the GameCube game Metroid Prime in North America. The bonus features in Prime can be unlocked by linking between the game and Fusion via the Nintendo GameCube â€“ Game Boy Advance link cable.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) is {{fearful that}} she will be cut from the hospital's staff, so she tries to get her name on the {{surgical}} board. Stevens and Hunt operate on Randy, and it is revealed that he is terminal. Lexie wants to donate her liver to Thatcher, but she is not a viable candidate, so she asks Meredith to do it, who subsequently agrees. Randy and his wife are dismayed with the outcome of the surgery, and Stevens proposes a plan to Hunt on <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> save him. Hunt agrees, but when the surgery suffers complications, the patient is pronounced dead, and Hunt condemns Stevens. Meredith undergoes the surgery, and it is a success for both her and Thatcher. Yang confronts Webber, and tells him that if a cardiothoracic surgeon is not hired, she should be cut from the program. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens sees the bear, and ultimately agrees that she and Karev need to relocate, out of the forest.|$|E
5|$|Book Nine, Nsara, {{follows the}} life of a young Muslim woman named Budur and her aunt Idelba in Europe, in the {{aftermath}} of the Long War. Budur's family is highly traditional and as there are not enough men left after the war for marriage prospects, she is forced to live in seclusion with her female cousins in the family's compound in Turi, a city in one of the Alpine Emirates. Idelba is an educated woman and was involved in physics research in Firanja before her husband's death, she is just as unhappy in Turi as Budur and wishes to return to her former work. One night, Idelba escapes and Budur follows her. Together they leave {{the life of}} captivity in the Alps and move to the more liberal and cosmopolitan city of Nsara (Saint-Nazaire in France). There they stay at a zawiyya, a refuge for women, Idelba restarts her work in physics and Budur enrols in university where she studies history. The history class is presided over by Kirana, a radical feminist lecturer who questions everything about Muslim society. Budur becomes close to Kirana who opens her eyes to the injustices that women face and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> seek emancipation and liberation (the two have a brief affair). Life at the university allows for open debate about all issues and Kirana focuses on the nature of history and contemporary events, such as the Muslim defeat in the Long War, which she blames on the failure of the Islamic countries to properly mobilize women for the war effort (something which the Chinese did almost totally). There is also a newfound interest in ancient history as the field of archaeology is taking off (theories about how and why the plague killed off the Europeans centuries before are a popular topic).|$|E

40|$|Military and {{security}} operations often require that participants move {{as quickly as}} possible, while avoiding harm. Humans judge <b>how</b> fast <b>they</b> <b>can</b> drive, <b>how</b> sharply <b>they</b> <b>can</b> turn and <b>how</b> hard <b>they</b> <b>can</b> brake, based on a subjective assessment of vehicle handling, which results from responsiveness to driving commands, ride quality, and prior experience in similar conditions. Vehicle handling {{is a product of}} the vehicle dynamics and the vehicle-terrain interaction. Near real-time methods are needed for unmanned ground vehicles to assess their handling limits on the current terrain in order to plan and execute extreme maneuvers. This paper describes preliminary research to develop on-the-fly procedures to capture vehicle-terrain interaction data and simple models of vehicle response to driving commands, given the vehicle-terrain interaction data. 1...|$|R
