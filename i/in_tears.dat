40|$|Aim. To assess {{prognostic}} {{value of}} neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in blood serum and <b>tear</b> fluid <b>in</b> optic neuritis (ON). Patients and methods. ON patients {{as well as}} healthy persons were examined. Group I included 27 patients (27 eyes) with acute ON. Group II included 23 patients (23 eyes) with ON and continuing optic nerve atrophy. Group III (controls) included 10 healthy persons (20 eyes). NSE levels <b>in</b> <b>tear</b> fluid and blood serum were measured using electrochemical luminescence immune analyzer Cobas-e- 411. Results. In group I, NSE levels <b>in</b> <b>tear</b> fluid and blood serum averaged 0. 81 ± 0. 15 and 13. 67 ± 1. 44 ng/mL, respectively. In group II, NSE level <b>in</b> <b>tear</b> fluid was 24. 86 ± 3. 84 ng/mL (on average) while its blood serum level was within normal limits. In controls, NSE levels <b>in</b> <b>tear</b> fluid and blood serum were within normal limits (15. 7 ± 0. 2 and 16. 8 ± 0. 12 ng/mL, respectively). Conclusions. In group I, NSE level <b>in</b> <b>tear</b> fluid was 19 ‑fold less than normal (р < 0. 05). It appears {{to be due to}} the activation of hypoxia and anaerobic glycolysis in neurons. In group II, NSE level <b>in</b> <b>tear</b> fluid was 1. 43 ‑fold higher than normal (р < 0. 05). This may be due to neuronal degeneration and progressive death with NSE release from damaged neurons into the cellular matrix.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. To {{investigate}} the possible role of cystatin C in eye biological fluids locally and in serum and lactoferrin revealing anti-tumor activity in eye tumor development. Background. The {{increased number of}} eye tumors was registered recently {{not only in the}} countries with high insolation, but also in the northern countries including Russia (11 cases per million of population). Search for new biological markers is important for diagnosis and prognosis in eye tumors. Cystatin C, an endogenous inhibitor of cysteine proteases, plays an important protective role in several tumors. Lactoferrin was shown to express anti-tumor and antiviral activities. It was hypothesized that cystatin C and lactoferrin could serve as possible biomarkers in the diagnosis of malignant and benign eye tumors. Study design. A total of 54 patients with choroidal melanoma and benign eye tumors were examined (part of them undergoing surgical treatment). Serum, tear fluid and intraocular fluid samples obtained from the anterior chamber of eyes in patients with choroidal melanoma were studied. Methods. Cystatin C concentration in serum and eye biological fluids was measured by commercial ELISA kits for human (BioVendor, Czechia); lactoferrin concentration &#x 2013; by Lactoferrin-strip D 4106 ELISA test systems (Vector-BEST, Novosibirsk Region, Russia). Results. Cystatin C concentration in serum of healthy persons was significantly higher as compared to tear and intraocular fluids. In patients with choroidal melanoma, increased cystatin C concentration was similar <b>in</b> <b>tear</b> fluid of both the eyes. Lactoferrin level <b>in</b> <b>tear</b> fluid of healthy persons was significantly higher than its serum level. Significantly increased lactoferrin concentration <b>in</b> <b>tear</b> fluid was noted in patients with benign and malignant eye tumors. Conclusion. Increased level of cystatin C <b>in</b> <b>tear</b> fluid seems to be a possible diagnostic factor in the eye tumors studied. However, it does not allow us to differentiate between malignant and benign eye tumors. Similar changes were noted for lactoferrin <b>in</b> <b>tear</b> fluid...|$|R

King Kong eventually became his favorite film and was the primary inspiration for his decision to become a filmmaker as a teenager. He read books about the making of King Kong and collected memorabilia, as well as articles from Famous Monsters of Filmland. Jackson paid tribute to the 1933 film by including Skull Island as the origin of the zombie plague in his 1992 film Braindead.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Proteases <b>in</b> <b>tear</b> fluid play {{important}} roles in the regulation of corneal wound healing. Inhibitors of proteolytic activity are major modulators of the associated events.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether (3 -APP can be detected <b>in</b> human <b>tear</b> fluid and, if so, to determine the isoform composition and cellular origin. Methods. Tear fluid was collected from healthy volunteers. The / 3 -APP was identified and characterized by immunoblotting using antibodies specific for domains of the / 3 -APP. The protein was characterized further by ion exchange chromatography. Expression of the / 5 -APP gene was studied using in situ hybridization and RNA-RNA solution hybridization assay. Results. / 3 -APP with protease inhibitory properties was identified in all samples of human tear fluid. Immunologic analysis revealed that it had been processed proteolytically before secretion. Gene expression studies showed that the /?-APP gene was expressed in lacrimal glands, particularly in acinar cells. The gene transcript almost exclusively corresponded to / 3 -AP...|$|R
