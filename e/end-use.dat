5|$|The {{demand for}} {{selenium}} by the electronics industry is declining, despite {{a number of}} continuing applications. Its photovoltaic and photoconductive properties are still useful in photocopying, photocells, light meters and solar cells. Its use as a photoconductor in plain-paper copiers once was a leading application, but in the 1980s, the photoconductor application declined (although {{it was still a}} large <b>end-use)</b> as more and more copiers switched to organic photoconductors. Though once widely used, selenium rectifiers have mostly been replaced (or are being replaced) by silicon-based devices. The most notable exception is in power DC surge protection, where the superior energy capabilities of selenium suppressors make them more desirable than metal oxide varistors.|$|E
5|$|The major global industrial-scale use {{of boron}} {{compounds}} (about 46% of <b>end-use)</b> is in production of glass fiber for boron-containing insulating and structural fiberglasses, especially in Asia. Boron {{is added to}} the glass as borax pentahydrate or boron oxide, to influence the strength or fluxing qualities of the glass fibers. Another 10% of global boron production is for borosilicate glass as used in high strength glassware. About 15% of global boron is used in boron ceramics, including super-hard materials discussed below. Agriculture consumes 11% of global boron production, and bleaches and detergents about 6%.|$|E
40|$|The one demand Hotelling model {{fails to}} explain the {{observed}} specialization of nonrenewable resources in specific <b>end-uses.</b> We develop a model with multiple demands and multiple resources and grades. Principles of Ricardian absolute and comparative advantage {{play an important role}} in determining the extraction profile. Absolute advantage in all <b>end-uses</b> creates a tendency for the dominant resource to be used first. But comparative advantage induces specialization of particular resources in specific <b>end-uses.</b> The 2 x 2 model of energy use is characterized, illustrating the trade-off between least-cost-first and resource specialization. The multiple-demand model also facilitates the analysis of resource and/or end-use-specific taxation. ...|$|R
30|$|For the {{evaluation}} of <b>end-uses,</b> some measurements (aggregated and individual) from customer 4 were considered. Figure  2 covers some typical <b>end-uses</b> during the winter season for this customer. Accordingly, {{it is clear that}} WH, EH, FR, OV and WM have a cycling demand (with two or multiple states). The frequency, amplitudes and “on/off” times are quite different, but it is really difficult to extract <b>end-uses,</b> except in certain time-periods (late at night, early morning, see Figs.  1 and 2). One feature common to these appliances, is that their demand evolves according to square/pulse waves. These patterns of main loads allow advantage to be taken of the results presented in Sect. 4. Moreover, other load patterns (quasi-continuous patterns) arise from filtering (for example HPAC with inverters).|$|R

In order to understand the energy demand trend of the service sector and its projection into the future, a global service sector model has been developed, within the IMAGE/TIMER model environment by linking the energy use of each of the <b>end-uses</b> to the sector’s value added (SVA) ...|$|R
25|$|Electric {{lighting}} started displacing kerosene as an illuminant in {{the late}} 19th century, especially in urban areas. However, kerosene remained the predominant commercial <b>end-use</b> for petroleum refined in the United States until 1909, when it was exceeded by motor fuels. The rise of the gasoline-powered automobile in the early 20th century created a demand for the lighter hydrocarbon fractions, and refiners invented methods to increase the output of gasoline, while decreasing the output of kerosene. In addition, some of the heavier hydrocarbons that previously went into kerosene were incorporated into diesel fuel. Kerosene kept some market share by being increasingly used in stoves and portable heaters.|$|E
25|$|A retail {{electricity}} market exists when <b>end-use</b> {{customers can}} choose their supplier from competing electricity retailers; one term {{used in the}} United States {{for this type of}} consumer choice is 'energy choice'. A separate issue for electricity markets is whether or not consumers face real-time pricing (prices based on the variable wholesale price) or a price that is set in some other way, such as average annual costs. In many markets, consumers do not pay based on the real-time price, and hence have no incentive to reduce demand at times of high (wholesale) prices or to shift their demand to other periods. Demand response may use pricing mechanisms or technical solutions to reduce peak demand.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Government signed {{bilateral}} Defense Trade Cooperation Treaties {{with the}} UK and Australian Governments in June and September 2007 respectively.

40|$|Traditional {{representations}} {{of energy in}} the manufacturing sector have tended to represent energy <b>end-uses</b> rather than actual energy service demands. While this representation if quite adequate for understanding how energy is used today, for forecasting future technology choices it is creates a rigid representation of how future energy is used. This representation can restrict the range of technology choices considered, particularly for fuel switching and on-site conversion processes such as combined heat and power (CHP). This paper discusses the differences between energy <b>end-uses</b> and service demands, proposes an approach for approximating service demands and discusses the ramifications of this alternative representation to energy modeling.

40|$|The "Other" <b>end-uses</b> (appliances, lighting, electronics, and {{miscellaneous}} equipment) {{continue to}} grow. This {{is particularly true}} in new homes, where increasing floor area and amenities are leading to higher saturation {{of these types of}} devices. This paper combines the findings of several field studies to assess the current state of knowledge about the "Other" <b>end-uses</b> in new homes. The field studies include sub-metered measurements of occupied houses in Arizona, Florida, and Colorado, as well as device-level surveys and power measurements in unoccupied new homes. We find that appliances, lighting, electronics, and miscellaneous equipment can consume from 46 percent to 88 percent of whole-house electricity use in current low-energy homes. Moreover, the annual consumption for the "Other" <b>end-uses</b> is not significantly lower in new homes (even those designed for low energy use) compared to existing homes. The device-level surveys show that builder-installed equipment is a significant contributor to annual electricity consumption, and certain devices that are becoming more common in new homes, such as structured wiring systems, contribute significantly to this power consumption. These findings suggest that energy consumption by these "Other" end uses is still too large to allow cost-effective zero-energy homes...|$|R

We don’t mean that as a criticism of nuclear power’s practitioners, on whose skill and devotion we all continue to depend; the impressive operational improvements in U.S. power reactors in recent years deserve great credit. It is simply how technologies and markets evolved, despite the best intentions and immense effort. In nuclear power’s heydey, its proponents saw no competitors but central coal-fired power stations. Then, in quick succession, came <b>end-use</b> efficiency, combined-cycle plants, distributed generation (including versions that recovered valuable heat previously wasted), and competitive windpower. The range of competitors will only continue to expand more and their costs to fall faster than any nuclear technology can match.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 2010s, the terms 3D {{printing}} and additive manufacturing evolved senses {{in which they}} were alternate umbrella terms for AM technologies, one being used in popular vernacular by consumer-maker communities and the media, and the other used more formally by industrial AM <b>end-use</b> part producers, AM machine manufacturers, and global technical standards organizations. Until recently, the term 3D printing has been associated with machines low-end in price or in capability. Both terms reflect that the technologies share the theme of sequential-layer material addition or joining throughout a 3D work envelope under automated control. Peter Zelinski, the editor-in-chief of Additive Manufacturing magazine, pointed out in 2017 that the terms are still often synonymous in casual usage but that some manufacturing industry experts are increasingly making a sense distinction whereby AM comprises 3D printing plus other technologies or other aspects of a manufacturing process.|$|E
