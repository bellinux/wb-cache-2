We find that these phenomena are evident in data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, but that they reflect the experiences of different groups of individuals. These groups of individuals are around the same size. While there is considerable mobility in income from the lowest two deciles of household <b>equivalised</b> <b>income,</b> this mobility is greater for those not reliant on welfare {{for the majority of}} their income than for those who are.

40|$|The main aim of {{the article}} is to analyse the working poor {{employees}} and their household's social situation in the national income and living conditions survey (EU-SILC). The analysis starts with {{the definition of the}} two main groups of employees according to the number of months spent in the full-time employment - those working whole year and those employed for 6 to 11 months. Poverty in earned income concept is used to evaluate poverty at individual level, confronting employee's income with single person household poverty line benchmark. The study then moves to the household level poverty measure based on household's disposable <b>equivalised</b> <b>income.</b> When shifting from the individual income to the household's one the economies of scale represented by an implicit or explicit equivalence scale used {{in the construction of the}} household poverty measure play a crucial role.

40|$|This work {{provides}} an update {{of changes in}} the income distribution over the period from 1998 - 2004, using data from the Household Labour Force Survey's annual Income Supplement (HLFS-IS). We focus on changes in working-age individuals' earnings and total income distribution and, to allow for resource sharing within households, their <b>equivalised</b> household total <b>income</b> distribution over the period. Our analysis shows that there have been broad gains in income to both individuals and households, suggesting the spoils of growth have been shared widely across the income distribution. Mean and median earnings increased 15 percent and 23 percent respectively, while mean and median individual income both increased 12 - 13 percent and <b>equivalised</b> household <b>income</b> by 11 percent. Inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, was more stable: individual earnings inequality fell 4 percent; individual income inequality was unchanged, while <b>equivalised</b> household <b>income</b> inequality increased 2 - 3 percent. The main contributors to the observed changes appear to be employment and real wage growth. We estimate that roughly one-half of the growth in average individual incomes is due to employment growth, and one-quarter each to demographic changes and wage growth. We also find that the relative employment and wage contributions have varied across the distribution: income gains {{at the lower end of}} the income distributions have been largely driven by employment, while changes at the higher end have been driven by wage gains.

40|$|The {{effect of}} social capital on one's health has drawn researchers' attention. In East-Asian countries, however, such an effect has been less studied than in Western countries. Mindful of this background, this study aimed to {{investigate}} the linkage between social capital and health {{at the level of}} a small area in Japan, and also to examine whether social capital mediates the relation between income inequality and health. Â The main survey targeted 34, 374 people aged 65 years and older from 25 communities who were without the need of nursing care. We collected 17, 269 questionnaires (response rate 50. 2 %), from which we used 15, 225 (response rate 44. 3 %) which had complete information on self-rated health, age, and sex. The main outcome measure was self-rated health status (1 Â =Â fair/poor; 0 Â =Â very good/good). The individual-level variables of age, sex, <b>equivalised</b> <b>income,</b> marital status, educational attainment, and type of housing were included to control for compositional effects. Average income, social capital and the Gini coefficient were used as community-level variables. The variable {{of social capital}} was calculated as the percentage of individuals in the community samples who reported "yes" or "it depends" to the question "Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted?" Â When the individual-level variables and the average <b>equivalised</b> <b>income</b> at the community level were controlled for, we found that high social capital and a decreased Gini coefficient were significantly associated with good self-rated health using a multilevel model. The association between social capital and self-rated health was insignificant after adjustment for the Gini coefficient. However, in other series of models, we also detected a statistically significant linkage between the increased Gini coefficient and negative responses to the question of individual-level trust using multilevel models. This suggests that people who live in conditions of high-income inequality tend to exhibit low trust levels, and that social capital mediates the relation between income inequality and health. Â This study is, to our knowledge, the first investigation of the linkage between social capital and health in Japan using multilevel analysis, and reports the first supported result of the relative income hypothesis in Japan. Additionally, the statistically significant linkage between the increased Gini coefficient and low trust observed in this study provides additional evidence to support the social cohesion and collective social pathway between income inequality and health.

40|$|Empirical {{analyses}} on the {{determinants of}} life satisfaction often include {{the impact of the}} number of children variable among available controls without fully discriminating between the two (socio- relational and pecuniary) components. In our empirical analysis on the German Socioeconomic Panel we show that, when introducing household income without correction for the number of members, the pecuniary effect prevails and the sign is negative while, when we equivalise income with the most commonly adopted equivalence scales, the non pecuniary (socio-relational) effect emerges and the impact of the variable is positive and significant above a minimal scale elasticity threshold. We further reject slope homogeneity and show that the positive relational effect is stronger for males, below median income households and East Germans. We interpret these subsample split results as driven by heterogeneous opportunity costs. Our empirical results give rise to a paradox: why people have children if the aggregate effect on life satisfaction is negative? We provide in the paper some interpretations consistent with our findings. Some of them are based on motivational complexity. This implies that demographic policies and the paradox are strictly connected. Effectiveness of tax/subsidies impacting on fertility crucially depends on whether the children paradox may be solved within the self-interested rationality paradigm. <b>equivalised</b> <b>income,</b> scale elasticities, life satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to examine the {{relationship}} between income and morbidity, both before and after controlling for other socio-economic variables. We use data from the Health and Lifestyle Survey (first wave), a national sample survey of adults, aged 18 upwards, in England, Wales and Scotland, conducted in 1984 – 1985. In total, 9003 interviews were achieved. We examine the shape of the relationship between household <b>equivalised</b> <b>income</b> and height, waist–hip ratio, respiratory function (FEV 1), malaise, limiting longterm illness. These indices of morbidity, both self-reported and measured, are approximately linearly related to the logarithm of income, in all except very high and low incomes (this means that increasing income is associated with better health, but that there are diminishing returns at higher levels of income). A doubling of income is associated with a similar eect on health, regardless of the point at which this occurs, providing this is within the central portion (10 – 90 %) of the income distribution. The eect of income on the health measures is comparable to that of the other socio-economic variables in combination. The shape of the relationship found between income and health is compatible with worse health in countries with greater income inequality, without the need to postulate any direc...|$|E
30|$|Poverty is {{computed}} at {{the household}} level: if the household <b>equivalised</b> disposable <b>income</b> {{is below the}} poverty threshold (i.e. the 60  % of the national median <b>equivalised</b> disposable <b>income),</b> all the household members are poor. Coherently, also covariates are computed at the household level. In particular, we control for household-specific and main earner characteristics. The main earner is chosen because it is considered as the most representative of the household economic condition. However, the analyses are carried out at an individual level, for two main reasons. First, the PARP rate is computed as the share of individuals living in such a condition. Since {{we are interested in}} the analyses of the Europe 2020 indicator, as defined by Eurostat, we want to stay {{as close as possible to}} the original definition.

40|$|Empirical {{analyses}} of the determinants of life satisfaction routinely include {{the number of children}} as one of the socio demographic controls, without explicitly considering that, for a given household income, more children imply a lower level of income per family member.

Using data from the German Socio Economic Panel 1984 – 2007 we confirm that the sign of the coefficient for the variable ‘‘number of children in the household’’ is negative when introducing household income without correction for the number of members in a life satisfaction regression. On the contrary, when we <b>equivalise</b> <b>income</b> with the most commonly adopted equivalence scales, so eliminating the monetary cost of raising children, the impact of the variable is positive and significant when a high level of economies of scale is assumed.

40|$|Study objective: To {{measure and}} {{decompose}} income related inequalities in self assessed health in England, Scotland, and Wales, 1979 - 1995. Design: The relation between individual health and a non-linear transformation of <b>equivalised</b> <b>income,</b> allowing for sex, age, country, and year effects, was estimated by multiple regression. The share of health attributable to transformed income and the Gini coefficient for transformed income were calculated. Inequality in health {{was measured by}} the partial concentration index, which is the product of the. Gini coefficient and the share of health attributable to transformed income. Participants and setting: Representative annual samples of the adult population living in private households in Great Britain 1979 - 1995. The total analysed sample was 299 968 people. Main results: Pro-rich health inequality was largest in Wales and smallest in England over the period because the effect of increased income on health was greatest in Wales and least in England. In all three countries, pro-rich health inequality increased throughout the period. In the early 1980 s this was primarily attributable to increases in income inequality. Thereafter the increased share of health attributable to income was the principal cause. Conclusions: Reductions in pro-rich health inequality can be achieved by reducing income inequality, reducing the effect of income on health, or both...|$|E

Methods: We created four patterns of depressive states (non-case, recovered, onset, repeatedly depressive) by combining responses to the measures (scoring four or more on seven items from the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for the ELSA participants and scoring 5 or more for the Geriatric Depression Scale- 15 for the JAGES participants) obtained at the baseline and follow-up. Sleep disturbance was assessed through responses to three questions on sleep problems.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{changes in}} poverty in Britain since 1997. A poverty level of 60 percent of median <b>equivalised</b> <b>income</b> is used. The first part examines {{the changes that}} occurred between 1996 / 7 and 2000 / 1 {{as shown by the}} Family Resources Survey, on which government estimates of Households Below Average Income are based. There was a small reduction in poverty overall and a larger proportionate fall in child poverty. This fall was attributable in part to increased employment and in part to changes in benefits and tax credits which increased for some, particularly for families on low earnings with children, but fell relative to median incomes for many of those without children and not in employment. The second part assesses policy changes implemented or announced for the period 2000 / 1 to 2003 / 4 by means of a micro-simulation model, POLIMOD, using a sample from the Family Resources Survey. The impact of policy changes is to reduce poverty compared to its prospects under previous policies. But, relative to a poverty level that rises in real terms in step with median incomes, future reductions in poverty are likely to be small. In order to keep on track towards the goal of halving child poverty by 2010, further policy measures will be required. poverty, welfare policy...|$|E
