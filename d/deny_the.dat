5|$|A {{particular}} viewpoint {{is called}} a naya or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, Nayavada does not <b>deny</b> <b>the</b> attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A naya reveals {{only a part of}} the totality, and should not be mistaken for the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be achieved by the doctrine of conditional predications (syādvāda).|$|E

5|$|Kant's Formula of Autonomy {{expresses the}} idea that an agent is obliged to follow the Categorical Imperative because of their {{rational}} will, rather than any outside influence.

This principle requires people to recognize the right of others to act autonomously and means that, as moral laws must be universalisable, what is required of one person is required of all.|$|E
