40|$|These RHEA- 2014 proceedings, therefore, put {{together}} {{all of the}} papers presented and discussed at the conference. The availability of new technology — global positioning systems (GPS), geographic information systems (GIS), sensors, the automation of agricultural machinery, and high resolution image sensing — has made possible the precise management of agricultural farms. Consequently, the concept of Precision Agriculture has developed as a management strategy that uses information technology to collect and process data from multiple sources to facilitate decisions associated with crop production. The Seventh Framework Programme project RHEA “Robot Fleets for Highly Effective Agricultural and Forestry Management” (FP 7 -NMP N. 245986) has focused its activity on the design, development, and testing {{of a new generation}} of automatic and robotic systems for both chemical and physical –mechanical and thermal– effective weed management for agriculture and forestry, covering a large variety of European products, including agriculture wide row crops, close row crops and woody perennials. RHEA has aimed at diminishing the use of agricultural and <b>forestry</b> <b>chemical</b> inputs by improving crop quality and health and safety for humans and by reducing production costs by means of a sustainable crop management using a fleet of heterogeneous robots –ground and aerial– equipped with advanced perception systems, enhanced end-effectors and improved decision control algorithms. As a part of the project activities, the RHEA consortium has organized two international conferences to disseminate the project results as well as to obtain inputs from other interested researchers, engineers, students and practitioners. The First International Conference on Robotics and associated High-technologies and Equipment for Agriculture (RHEA- 2012) was held in Pisa, Italy on September 19 - 21, 2012 and was devoted to the applications of automated systems and robotics for crop protection in sustainable precision agriculture. Now, we introduce the Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Robotics and associated High-technologies and Equipment for Agriculture and forestry (RHEA- 2014), to be held in Madrid, Spain, on May 22 - 23, 2014, and are dedicated to new trends in mobile robotics, perception and actuation for both agriculture and forestry. This conference takes place after the final demonstration of the RHEA project devoted to present the experimental RHEA project results to the Precision Agriculture community. Therefore, the conference brings the attendees the opportunity to discuss the RHEA project outcomes and to compare them with results achieved recently by other colleagues. This project has received funding from the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement no 245986 Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The article {{provides}} information about control of Melolontha spp. adults, {{the methods used}} in the past, chemical pest control as well as treatments applied today. In old times, cockchafer populations were reduced mechanically, by manual collection during the swarming period or by covering soil surfaces to prevent egg lying by females. Chemical pest control methods were introduced in the fifties of the 1900 s, and in subsequent 50 years, they were improved to be less and less environmentally threatening. In many countries, including Poland, there have recently been introduced progressive restrictions {{on the use of}} insecticides in <b>forestry.</b> Banning <b>chemical</b> treatments against cockchafers resulted in going back to traditional methods and seeking alternate solutions, e. g. biological control agents. In the 1990 s, polyethylene nets were used to prevent egg laying in the soil by cockchafer females. At the same time, there was tested possible usefulness of a botanical insecticide derived from neem (Azadirachta indica) to combat cockchafer adults. The net, which needs to be spread flat on the ground, can be effective in orchards, however, in forested areas, the success of this method was limited due to the specific structure of forest land. In general, both methods stimulated no interest on the part of forestry on account of technical obstacles and too high cost of the botanical insecticide. Neglecting treatments toward reduction of cockchafer excessive numbers during their ongoing outbreak can bring about adverse changes in the forest structure. Przemysław Szmi...|$|R

40|$|Organic farming was {{proposed}} in 1940 by Lord Northbourne {{as a response}} to chemical agriculture. Since then, organic agriculture has developed into an international A$ 50 billion industry with annual growth reported up to 30 %. Currently {{it is one of the}} fastest growing food sectors with demand exceeding supply in many markets, and price premiums averaging 80 % in Australia. With economic, and now environmental, incentives for planting trees, there is the opportunity, and even imperative, for a new silviculture category that embraces the precepts of organic agriculture. There are environmental, economic and ethical issues with carbon offset programmes that seek to reduce, or erase, the carbon footprint of an activity, while collaterally increasing the pesticide footprint; this may be a Faustian bargain. Certified Organic Forestry standards have made a tentative start with a modest uptake. Organic forestry offers a clean green, rather than a dirty green, option for carbon offsets, and can appeal to those inclined to a precautionary principle rather than a postcautionary principle approach. As consumers who are already familiar with the premises and promises of organic food and agriculture are attracted to carbon offsetting, this customer group has the potential to drive demand for Certified Organic Forestry.

From the rheology results of Phase I of this project, {{it was found}} that the bio-binders tested had good performance, similar to conventional asphalt, except at low temperatures. Phase II of this project addresses this shortcoming and evaluates the Superpave performance of laboratory mixes produced with the enhanced bio-binders. The main objective of this research was to develop a bio-binder capable of replacing conventional asphalt in flexible pavements by incorporating ground tire rubber (GTR) into bio-oil derived from fast pyrolysis of agriculture and <b>forestry</b> residues. The <b>chemical</b> compatibility of the new bio-binder with GTR was assessed, and the low-temperature performance of the bio-binders was enhanced by the use of GTR.

The laboratory performance test results showed that the performance of the newly developed bio-binder mixes is as good as or better than conventional asphalt mixes for fatigue cracking, rutting resistance, moisture sensitivity, and low-temperature cracking. These results need to be validated in field projects in order to demonstrate adequate performance for this innovative and sustainable technology for flexible pavements...|$|R
40|$|This book {{takes as}} its point of {{departure}} three observations about {{the current state of}} transnational regulation within and beyond the EU: Across a wide and expanding range of policy fields, the EU has developed over the past fifteen years a new architecture of experimentalist governance based on framework rule making and revision through recursive review of implementation experience in diverse local contexts. Through a variety of institutional mechanisms and channels, the EU is actively seeking to extend its own internal rules, norms, standards, and governance processes beyond the Union’s borders to third countries and the wider world. In a number of major issue-areas, experimentalist regimes with similar architectural features to those within the EU appear to be developing on a global or transnational scale. The book aims to explore, both empirically and theoretically, the relationship between these three contemporaneous trends, and to assess their consequences for the EU’s evolving role in transnational regulation. The book tackles these questions about the external dimension of EU experimentalist governance and its relationship to broader trends in transnational regulation through in-depth analysis of recent developments across a series of key policy domains by an interdisciplinary group of European and North American scholars. The domains addressed include neighbourhood policy, food safety, GMOs, <b>chemicals,</b> <b>forestry,</b> competition, finance, data privacy, disability rights, crisis management, justice, and security...|$|R
40|$|The study {{reported}} here focuses on the environmental pressure exerted by large-scale eucalyptus-based kraft pulp industry in Thailand. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify the most important sources of greenhouse gases, acidifying and eutrophying compounds and tropospheric ozone precursors, human toxicity compounds and solid waste associated with the kraft pulp industry. To this end, we performed an environmental systems analysis of the kraft pulp industry system in which we distinguished between two subsystems: the eucalyptus forestry subsystem and the kraft pulp production subsystem. The results indicate that the environmental pressure is caused by the kraft pulp production subsystem rather than by the eucalyptus <b>forestry</b> one. The <b>chemical</b> recovery unit was found to be the most important source of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and responsible for more than one-half of the emissions of greenhouse gases and acidifying compounds from eucalyptus-based kraft pulp production in Thailand. Biomass combustion in the energy gene ration unit is an important source of nitrogen oxide (NO x) and carbon monoxide (CO) which in turn are responsible for over 50 % of the emissions of tropospheric ozone precursors. About 73 % of the eutrophication is caused by biological aerobic wastewater treatment emitting phosphorus (P). With respect to the eucalyptus forestry, only fertilizer use in eucalyptus plantations is a relevant source of pollution through the emission of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and phosphate (PO 4 3 ¿) ...|$|R
40|$|This is the Evaluation of {{the impact}} of {{cypermethrin}} use in forestry on Welsh streams from the University of Plymouth, published on September 2010 by the Environment Agency South West. The report focuses attention on Cypermethrin, a highly active synthetic pyrethroid insecticide effective against a wide range of pests in agriculture, public health, and animal husbandry. It is also used in forestry to control the pine weevil, Hylobius abietis. Cypermethrin is very toxic to aquatic invertebrates and fish at nanogram per litre concentrations. This project checks the effectiveness of current best practice measures in minimising the risk of pollution {{associated with the use of}} cypermethrin in <b>forestry</b> in Wales. <b>Chemical</b> results from the intensive studies show that cypermethrin entered minor watercourses draining treated areas at two of the eight sites. In one of these cases the level was well in excess of the short-term Predicted No Effect Concentration. The absence of a buffer area at the other site resulted in the cypermethrin reaching a main drain. However dilution appeared to be sufficient to prevent any impact on water quality or on the invertebrate community in the main stream. Invertebrate and chemical data from the extensive survey showed little evidence of pollution due to wider use of cypermethrin in Welsh forestry. Finally, a number of recommendations are made for further tightening controls on forestry practice to minimise the risk of cypermethrin entering the aquatic environment...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} whether the occurrence of environmental disclosures in a corporate annual report {{is associated with a}} firm environmental visibility. As environmentally vis-ible firms are easier to observe by relevant constituents, they are more vulnerable to public scru-tiny. This paper hypothesizes that environmentally visible firms tend to disclose environmental in-formation in their annual reports as compared to those of less visible companies. A firm’s environmental visibility is proxied by size, profitability and industry sensitivity to the environment. While firm size is measured by total asset and profitability is measured by return on Asset (ROA), industry sensitivity is measured by the sensitivity of firm activities to the envi-ronment. Industry sectors such as banking, insurance, finance, services are considered as non-sensitive, whereas those of <b>chemical,</b> <b>forestry,</b> mining, automotive, paper and timber, are consid-ered as sensitive sectors. This paper uses the categorization by the Indonesian Accounting Stand-ards (PSAK) No. 32 and 33 which considers forestry and mining firms as the most environmentally sensitive industries by requiring firms in these sectors to report any material information regarding environmental issues. Environmental disclosure in this study is measured by the occurrence of environmental information in the annual reports using a dummy variable (1, if it occurs and 0, otherwise). The sample consists of 205 companies listed on Jakarta Stock Exchange in 2002. It is found that 66 of companies under non-sensitive industries did not mention any environmental information. This study also shows that the occurrence of environmental disclosure in annual reports of Indonesian companies is associated with size and industry sector, but not with profitability...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} an effective, appropriate and applicable {{technology for the}} treatment of contaminated surface water from the Princess Dump. Princess Dump is an old abandoned and unrehabilitated gold tailings storage facility situated in Roodepoort, west of Johannesburg. It falls within the Upper Klip River subcatchment, which forms part of the Klip River catchment. Undoubtedly, abandoned gold tailings storage facilities have caused varying degrees of environmental damage especially those that have been abandoned and left unrehabilitated. Water pollution that results from these facilities does not only influence the local environment but also other receptors downstream of the source. In order to assess the extent of water pollution attributed to the abandoned Princess Dump, sampling was done on specific points around the study site. Other physical and chemical water quality sampling data was obtained from the Department of Water Affairs and <b>Forestry</b> (DWAF). The <b>chemical</b> analysis was performed on the data to determine whether the water quality parameter concentration was within the Target Water Quality Range (TWQR) as stipulated by DWAF for various uses, while correlation analysis determined the relationship between the various water quality parameters at the time of sampling. These analyses gave an indication of the potential liability of the abandoned Princess Dump as far as the degradation of the local surface water quality. The study identified that pollution resulting from the Princess Dump is seriously impacting on the water quality environment around the site. Different surface water treatment systems, active and passive, were reviewed and analysed {{on the basis of their}} efficiency and applicability to the site and their ability to remediate the contaminated surface water around the site. This was done in comparison between the various identified systems and their ability to treat the contaminated water that is being released from the abandoned site. A preferred water treatment system was identified based on its projected efficiency in treating the water quality from the site while considering the worst case scenario of the pollution. Other potential point and non point sources of pollution around the study site were also identified and elaborated on and recommendations made to improve the water quality around the site. It was concluded that the local surface water quality has been degraded and that a passive surface water treatment technology can adequately improve the water quality before it is released into the environment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRail {{transports}} {{of single}} wagons or wagon groups are an indispensable {{part of the}} transport chain, such as for the <b>forestry</b> and the <b>chemical</b> industry. However, high production costs and low quality standards {{have led to a}} continuous decline in market shares in recent years. In order to counteract this tendency, ten European companies and research institutions, covering the areas of rail transport and logistics, have combined their forces in the scope of the research and development project ViWaS (Viable Wagonload Production Schemes). The goal: Innovative and simultaneously practical solutions for a sustainable wagonload transport. The applicability of these solutions and their effects have been proven with the aid of business cases in terms of field tests and pilot operations. The following main innovations have been achieved within the ViWaS project:(1) Improved “last-mile” operating concepts incorporating hybrid locomotives and bi-modal shunting engines (by Bentheimer Eisenbahn, Fret SNCF and SBB Cargo supported by HaCon and NEWOPERA) : The new production method for last-mile delivery is based on the idea of separating train movements and sidings shunting processes by deploying bimodal road-rail tractors. Processes within the sidings have been simplified; as a result costs for equipment and staff could be reduced considerably. Hybrid locomotives are fundamental in securing a seamless access to regional distribution rail networks. Potential cost advantages have been identified comparing different traction combinations of real-life transport chains. (2) Modular wagon technologies for a flexible and efficient use of resources (by Wascosa and SBB Cargo) : In detail, three components have been developed up to prototype status: Wascosa's Flex Freight Car is a light container wagon with an accessible floor and thereby applicable for various transport purposes. The Timber Cassette 2. 0 is a new superstructure for log wood transport that features foldable stanchions and can be used in combination with a container wagon. In case the Timber Cassette is not loaded, it can be removed and stacked at the terminal or on a container wagon. Empty runs will be minimized generating efficiency improvements. Additionally, SBB Cargo has developed the so-called Container Loading Adapter, another add-on to a container wagon. It facilitates container loading and unloading in sidings. SBB Cargo will deploy this new component within the “Swiss Split” production system, combining intermodal with wagonload transport. (3) Smart wagon telematics allowing improved tracking at reduced costs (by Eureka) : A separate abstract “Smart Telematics Enabling Efficient Rail Transport” (Contribution ID 875) has been submitted for TRA 2016). 4. A new simulation tool for planning and optimizing single wagonload networks (by ETH Zürich) : WagonSIM is an agent-based simulation tool for rail freight networks to facilitate the optimization of SWL production schemes. It is based on the OpenSource software MatSIM. The tool models the routing of freight wagons according to the routes within the real SWL network. Therefore, the modelling of two network levels is required, the production network and the physical infrastructure.

Data which is used in this research collected through proportioned {{stratified random sampling}} {{which is based on}} the industry stratification on Jakarta Stock Exchange in 2001. Then according to the pm-poses of this research, the statistic method which is used to test the four hypotheses are T- test and Anova (Analysis of Varians). The probability distribution of the data is normal. Normality test which is used is Kolmogorov —Smirnov and Shaphiro — Wilk. Instrument which used by this research for social disclosure measurement is social disclosure check list which issued by Ernst and Ernst 1978. Then for companies size measurement is based on the total asset according to the SK Menteri Perindustrian No. 13 /M/SK-I/ 3 / 1990. While the industry type measurement is based on its sensitivity level of industry to the environment damage, consumer visibility and political visibility. High profile companies consisted of agricultural, <b>chemical,</b> <b>forestry,</b> automotive, pulp and paper, tobacco, food and beverages, infrastructure, communication, and mining, gas and oil industry.

(2) There were not significant difference between social disclosure which is applied by big companies and medium companies, and between medium companies and small companies. It is showed by probability value which higher than significant level, 0, 061 and 0, 335. But there were significant difference between social disclosure which applied by big companies and small companies.
