Both fractures were fixed by <b>dual</b> <b>plating</b> technique using non locking plates. Intra operative fracture site biopsy revealed marked osteopenia and hence the patient was treated for osteoporosis. DiscussionBoth fractures united well at 14 weeks. At final follow up of 6 years there were no radiological signs of implant loosening and the patient was able to walk without any aids and had a range of 80 ° and 60 ° flexion in {{the right and left}} knees respectively.

40|$|Objective: The role of plate {{configuration}} {{was found}} inconclusive on the biomechanical {{effects of the}} plate size and hole number for <b>dual</b> <b>plate</b> constructions in humeral shaft fractures. The {{purpose of this study}} was to test the biomechanical stability of various <b>dual</b> <b>plate</b> constructions. Methods: Twenty-four left humeri (4 th Generation Composite Humerus, Sawbones, Malmö, Sweden) with comminuted midshaft humeral fracture were used. Four groups of plate constructs were tested: laterally fixed 8 -hole locking plate and screws were combined with anteriorly locking plates containing 0, 4, 6, or 8 holes in groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively. The alterations in axial, bending, and torsional angles were recorded. Results: There were no fixation failures during axial, bending, or torsional stiffness testing within the elastic behavior limits. Axial stiffness was highest in Group IV. Torsional stiffness, posterior-to-anterior bending stiffness, lateral-to-medial bending stiffness, and medial-to-lateral bending stiffness were lowest in Group I. Conclusion: The similar stiffness values for the 8 -to- 4 hole and 8 -to- 6 hole plate constructions indicate that the 8 -to- 4 hole construction is an option in young adults, while the stiffest 8 -to- 8 hole combination may be an option for osteoporotic patients...|$|E
30|$|Conventional <b>dual</b> <b>plate</b> osteosynthesis necessitates {{invasive}} dissection of {{a precarious}} soft tissue envelope with concomitant compression {{of the plate}} to bone with potential compromise of tenuous local periosteal vasculature. Complications of wound breakdown, deep tissue infection, compartment syndrome, delayed union, nonunion, secondary loss of reduction, peroneal palsies, hardware failure and arthrofibrosis have been well-documented throughout the literature resulting in great variability in achieving satisfactory outcomes [5 – 12]. Similarly, while the use of hybrid external fixators obviates the need for extensive surgical dissection, superficial and pin tract infections, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, varus malalignment and loss of knee motion are among the many complications reported [13 – 16].|$|E
40|$|Background: Schatzker type V and VI tibial {{fractures}} {{are complex}} injuries, usually treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using <b>dual</b> <b>plates</b> or ring fixators. ORIF {{has the advantage}} of not requiring pin tract care, but has a higher infection rate, especially in open fractures. We have combined the advantages of these two methods to treat these difficult fractures. Materials and Methods: Ten Schatzker type V and 11 Schatzker type VI fractures were treated between 2006 and 2010. ORIF with <b>dual</b> <b>plates</b> was performed, only if there was marked articular displacement (> 2 mm) in a closed fracture. All other fractures including open fractures and closed fractures with soft tissue compromise or minimal articular displacement were treated with ring fixators. The outcomes were analyzed and documented using the Honkonen and Jarvinen subjective, clinical, functional, and radiological criteria and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC). Results: Nine closed fractures with marked articular displacement (> 2 mm) were treated with <b>dual</b> <b>plates.</b> Eight closed fractures with minimal articular displacement (< 2 mm) and poor skin condition and four open fractures were treated with ring fixators. The mean follow-up period was 2 ½ years. The mean postoperative knee flexion was 128 °. All patients could walk, jump, and climb steps. 90 % could squat, though only 50 % could duck walk properly. Radiologically, 85 % had a plateau tilt of less than 5 °, 92 % had an articular step of less than 2 mm, and a residual articular widening of less than 5 mm. There were no major infections. Two patients had minor pin tract infections and two requested that their plates be removed subsequently. Conclusion: The protocol used to treat Schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures has had excellent results and we suggest that all open fractures be treated with ring fixators and that ORIF should be done only for closed fractures with marked displacement...|$|R

In the present study, the effect of Paenibacillus sp. EJP 73 metabolites on L. rufus EO 3 pre-symbiotic growth was tested in two agar plate-based systems. Specifically, volatile metabolites were investigated using a <b>dual</b> <b>plate</b> system, in which the presence of strain EJP 73 resulted in a significant negative effect on L. rufus EO 3 hyphal radial growth but enhanced hyphal branching and reduced internode distance. Soluble metabolites produced by strain EJP 73 were tested on L. rufus EO 3 growth in single-agar plate assays by incorporating bacterial cell-free whole or molecular weight fraction spent broth into the agar. Whole spent broth had {{a negative effect on}} hyphal growth, whereas a low molecular weight fraction (100 - 1, 000) promoted colony radial growth. Headspace and spent broth analysis of strain EJP 73 cultures revealed 2, 5 -diisopropylpyrazine to be the most significant component. Synthesised 2, 5 -diisopropylpyrazine and elevated CO 2 (2, 000 ppm) were tested as specific volatile metabolites in the <b>dual</b> <b>plate</b> system, but neither produced the response shown when strain EJP 73 was present. Increased pre-symbiotic hyphal branching leading to increased likelihood of plant infection may be an important MHB mechanism for strain EJP 73.

The average time to union was 11.5  weeks and the mean elbow flexion/extension arc was 4 °– 131 °. Possible disadvantages of this approach are the necessity to reflect the triceps to accommodate plate application on the lateral column, {{and the need for}} using two plates to secure reduction.

30|$|<b>Dual</b> <b>plating</b> {{although}} {{offers a}} better biomechanical strength [16] does {{so at the}} expense of greater soft tissue dissection. It requires almost circumferential exposure of both the medial and lateral column. Such an enormous soft tissue dissection and exposure although justifiable for intra-articular fractures seems unreasonable for extra-articular shaft fractures. Preservation of the soft tissue envelope is an important aspect in fracture healing, and it has led to the change in the earlier concept of anatomic reduction and rigid fixation [17]. This concept is no longer valid for most of the extra-articular fractures with complex fracture patterns, where minimal soft tissue dissection and stable fixation has shown to have better results and is now the standard principle [18]. Although there have been no comparative studies of dual column vs. single column fixation for distal humerus fractures, we believe and suggest that the higher infection and non-union rates quoted in many series of distal humerus fractures may in part be due to greater soft tissue dissection and a longer operative time required for <b>dual</b> column <b>plating</b> [5, 8].|$|R

The level of electromagnetic field penetration for a given structure constructed from Carbon Fibre Composites is an important consideration in the electromagnetic hazard protection design of the systems. This problem must be addressed with confidence in order to produce design specifications for equipment, optimise system installation and understand system integration within the structure. The aim of this research is to further the understanding of the electrical current flow, both A. C. and D. C., through practical aircraft standard joints constructed in Carbon Fibre Composite. The investigations incorporate consideration of the D. C. conditions of the joint and measurements in the frequency band 1 MHz to 50 MHz utilising a <b>dual</b> <b>plate</b> transmission line.

The bean plant protection by the six bacterial strains, though at different level, was observed either in in vitro or in greenhouse cotyledon and trifoliate pathogenicity leaf assays, respectively. The Induced Systemic Resistance (ISR) is apparently involved and, in fact, ISR has been recently ascertained in parallel studies using the pathosystem Arapidopsis thaliana and X. c. pv. amoriaceae for 3 of the above rhizobacteria. The six antagonistic bacterial strains did produce an array of hydrolytic enzymes, diffusible antimicrobial substances and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) which inhibit the growth of several plant pathogenic fungi as assessed either in <b>dual</b> <b>plate</b> and VOCs assays.

40|$|Background: <b>Dual</b> <b>plate</b> {{fixation}} in comminuted bicondylar tibial plateau fractures remains controversial. Open {{reduction and}} internal fixation, specifically through compromised soft tissues, {{has historically been}} associated with major wound complications. Alternate methods of treatment have been described, {{each with its own}} merits and demerits. We performed a retrospective study to evaluate the functional outcome of lateral and medial plate fixation of Schatzker type V and VI fractures through an anterolateral approach, and a medial minimally invasive approach or a posteromedial approach. Materials and Methods: We treated 46 tibial plateau fractures Schatzker type V and VI with lateral and medial plates through an anterolateral approach and a medial minimal invasive approach over an 8 years period. Six patients were lost to followup. Radiographs in two planes were taken in all cases. Immediate postoperative radiographs were assessed for quality of reduction and fixation. The functional outcome was evaluated according to the Oxford Knee Score criteria on followup. Results: Forty patients (33 men and 7 women) who completed the followup were included in the study. There were 20 Schatzker type V fractures and 20 Schatzker type VI fractures. The mean duration of followup was 4 years (range 1 - 8 years). All patients had a satisfactory articular reduction defined as ≤ 2 mm step-off or gap as assessed on followup. All patients had a good coronal and sagittal plane alignment, and articular width as assessed on supine X-rays of the knee in the anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views. The functional outcome, as assessed by the Oxford Knee Score, was excellent in 30 patients and good in 10 patients. All patients returned to their pre-injury level of activity and employment.

30|$|Circular {{external}} fixators utilize beam {{loading of}} the tensioned fine wires to provide stability {{across the entire}} length of the wire [28].

Biomechanical analysis demonstrated that four tensioned olive wires combined with a single lag screw provides better stability than <b>dual</b> <b>plating</b> [29]. For this reason, we always combine a single lag screw with four tensioned olive wires to the proximal ring.
