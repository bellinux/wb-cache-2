40|$|Silk {{is often}} cited as a {{material}} worth imitating, due to its high strength and toughness. In order to produce a synthetic analogue, or enhanced natural version, the microstructural basis of these properties must be understood. Current understanding is that silk deforms through the detachment of nano-scale crystallites, {{in the manner of}} a damaged composite. This picture forms the basis for constitutive models, but validation data is limited to low strain-rates. Here we present a programme of research in which high-rate behaviour is studied through ballistic impact experiments. These have been applied to the silk of the Bombyx mori moth, as harvested from cocoons, and to the major ampullate thread of the <b>golden</b> orb <b>weaver</b> spider Nephila edulis. Longitudinal wave-speeds, and air drag coefficients, have been calculated for selected cases. Differences between the response of various silks and a similar synthetic fibre, nylon, are discussed, and future plans are presented...|$|R
25|$|The <b>golden</b> silk orb <b>weaver</b> targets many {{different}} organisms as prey, ranging from small flies and beetles to larger cicadas and locusts. As {{a result of}} their strong web structure small birds and bats can also become trapped and fed upon. Whilst most of the captured prey is relatively small compared to Nephila sp the majority of biomass consumed comes from larger more rare prey. Prey larger than 66% of the captors size accounts for just 16.5% of prey captured but 85% of prey consumed, indicating the spider is selective in its feeding habits.|$|R
25|$|Nephila produce large {{asymmetric}} orb webs {{up to one}} and a half {{meters in}} diameter. The hub of the web is not positioned centrally but rather in the upper section; this means {{that the majority of the}} sticky capture strands are found in the lower section of the web.Nephila species remain in their webs permanently and therefore have a higher predation risk. There is a barrier web structure on either side of the main web to mitigate this risk. The <b>golden</b> silk orb <b>weaver</b> is named for the yellow color of the spider silk used to construct these webs.|$|R

5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is common}} amongst spiders, both in luring prey and stealthily {{approaching}} predators. One {{case is the}} <b>golden</b> orb <b>weaver</b> (Nephila clavipes), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate the webs with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to see. Other colors were also learned and avoided, but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow pigmented webs with danger. Yellow {{is the color of}} many nectar bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow is not worth while. Another form of mimicry is based not on color but pattern. Species such as Argiope argentata employ prominent patterns {{in the middle of their}} webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as nectar guides. Spiders change their web day to day, which can be explained by bees' ability to remember web patterns. Bees are able to associate a certain pattern with a spatial location, meaning the spider must spin a new pattern regularly or suffer diminishing prey capture.|$|R
40|$|Spider silk is the world's toughest {{biological}} material yet very few spider species silks have been characterised. We analysed both the silk gland transcriptome and the silk mechanical {{properties of the}} exceptionally large Australian rainforest <b>golden</b> orb <b>weaver</b> Nephila pilipes {{in comparison to the}} related garden variety spider Nephila plumipes. Illumina next-generation sequencing of the major ampullate gland coupled with LC-MS/MS of the solid silk fibre identified highly expressed genes within the gland that may be involved {{in the formation of the}} silk fibres from the soluble to solid state, as well as proteins that may contribute to stabilization of the fibre. Biomechanical analysis of the two silk threads indicated Nephila pilipes had significantly tougher silk with higher strain capacity than its smaller congener, producing threads with toughness up to 305 MJ/m 3. Within N. pilipes, smaller silk fibrils were produced by larger spiders, yielding tougher threads whose fibril diameter was negatively correlated with silk toughness. In contrast, while spider size was correlated with thread diameter in N. plumipes, there were no clear patterns relating to silk toughness, which suggests that the differences in properties between the silk of the two species arise through differing molecular structure...|$|R
500|$|The mimic {{may have}} a {{particular}} significance for duped prey. One such case is spiders, amongst which aggressive mimicry is quite common both in luring prey and disguising stealthily approaching predators. One case is the <b>golden</b> orb <b>weaver</b> (Nephila clavipes), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate the webs with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to see.

Yellow is the colour of many nectar-bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow is not worthwhile. Another form of mimicry is based not on colour but pattern.

40|$|In {{polyandrous}} species, paternity may {{be influenced}} by the timing and frequency of mating. Female spiders possess 2 genital openings that lead to separate sperm-storage structures. Thus, even when mating with a previously mated female, a male may reduce direct sperm competition by inseminating the opposite opening to her first mate. Such morphology may provide females with greater control over paternity. We examined simultaneously whether males avoided already inseminated female genital openings and whether this behavior varied with the time between successive matings. To explore these questions, we mated female <b>golden</b> orb <b>weaver</b> spiders, Nephila edulis, each to 2 males and manipulated the timing of their second mating. We documented male insemination patterns and explored the influence of male mating decisions on paternity success using the irradiated male technique. We found that 60 % of males avoided sperm competition by discriminating against inseminated genital openings. Moreover, male mating behavior had a dramatic impact on the paternity success of irradiated males. When males inseminated the same genital opening, the competitive ability of the irradiated male's sperm was dramatically reduced resulting in lower paternity success. In contrast, when the 2 males inseminated opposite genital openings both males sired equal proportions of offspring regardless of their radiation status. There was no evidence that the timing of the second mating affected patterns of paternity. Our data suggest that differences in sperm quality may influence paternity success of N. edulis males under a sperm-competitive scenario. In contrast, females appear to have limited postmating control over paternity. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|Spider silk is {{a natural}} {{material}} that has unique mechanical properties. These include high mechanical strength and toughness, and strength-to-weight ratios five times that of steel fibers. The structure of spider silk {{is of particular interest}} at the molecular level due to its effects on the properties of the material, particularly its mechanical behavior. Research at Cal Poly Pomona {{over the past few years}} has focused on evaluating the mechanical properties of fibers from different spider species with a view to elucidating structure-property interrelationships that would form the basis for new material designs. Our focus in the current project has been on the determination of the mechanical properties of spider silk produced by the Araneus gemma, known as the orb weaver, and the Nephila clavipes, known as the giant <b>golden</b> orb <b>weaver.</b> These two types of spider hang-line silk were tested in uniaxial tension using a mechanical test frame - the Instron 3342. A 5 N load cell was used to obtain the load-extension data for the analysis. The properties of these silks were compared to the silk from the Lactrodectus geometricus, known as the brown widow spider, which was tested by the previous teams. The effect of engineering strain rate on the ultimate tensile strength, extensibility, etc., of these silks will be discussed. The behavior of spider silk will be discussed as a viscoelastic polymer. Ideas for future research, e. g., silk-reinforced agar composites, cellular growth along silk strands, viscoelastic characterization using a Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (DMA), and further characterization of the hang-line silk at different strain rates using the Instron tensile tester will also be discussed...|$|R
40|$|A needlestick {{injury is}} defined by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) as a {{percutaneous}} injury due to accidental handling of a sharp. The CDC estimates that approximately 400, 000 needlestick incidences occur each year in United States healthcare facilities, and reports from other developed countries, such as the United Kingdom and Spain, share similar frequencies. Further, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates two million international healthcare workers are exposed annually to infectious disease as a consequence of a needlestick event, resulting in 37. 6 % and 39 % of hepatitis B and hepatitis C cases, respectively. In the United States, federal and state legislation have greatly reduced incidence rates since the late 1980 s, providing education, better protocols and effective post-exposure management. Additionally, the introduction of national surveillance databases led to stronger epidemiological support for the causation of needlestick injury and consequently, a stronger national awareness. In an effort to better protect healthcare workers, corporations such as DuPont and BD have further reduced needlestick incidences in the United States by designing products ranging from safety-engineered syringes to adhesive strips surrounded in strong synthetic materials such as Kevlar® and Lycra®. These devices are instrumental in minimizing the needlestick problem in both the clinic and in the operating room. As part of the current United States legislation, healthcare organizations are mandated to implement and utilize these safety-engineered syringes and needles. Despite the rise in protective equipment, national database surveillance and federal/state legislature, the incidence rate remains high as hundreds of thousands of injuries persist each year. We sought to find other solutions for better protecting healthcare workers through the implementation of <b>golden</b> orb <b>weaver</b> spider silk in personal protective equipment. This silk, gathered from the Nephila clavipes, is one of the strongest and toughest biomaterials in known existence. Its characteristically high energy absorption makes it an ideal material for reinforcing gloves and other protective equipment for healthcare workers. We believe that products made from this silk would serve as strong barriers against needlestick injury and bloodborne pathogen exposure. We {{are in the process of}} designing and fabricating such a glove and completed preliminary strength testing to ensure the superiority of our material. Tensile testing conducted at Tufts' Department of Biomedical Engineering suggests that our silk possesses the same mechanical profile as N. clavipes silk found in published literature. We plan on utilizing Fourier-transform infrared (DSC-FTIR) microspectroscopy to study the protein structure and possibly conducting enzyme degradation assays to assess the property changes under unique conditions. This information combined with our patented extraction and reinforcing methodology will provide the groundwork for partnering with industry leaders to make this product a reality and help eliminate the incidence of needlestick injury...|$|R
