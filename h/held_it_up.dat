5|$|Manchester United {{fashioned}} {{the first}} chance {{of the second half}} after just three minutes, when Rooney cut inside from the right along the face of the penalty area, but his left-footed shot was blocked away for a corner kick. Soon after, Van Nistelrooy received the ball {{on the edge of the}} penalty area and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> before playing a through-ball to Keane, but the Irishman's low cross was diverted behind by Kolo Touré before it reached Rooney. United then had their third chance in the space of five minutes when Ronaldo shot just wide from 25 yards, from the left corner of the penalty area.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} has been used at least for millennia if not longer since it is also used by the great apes, {{as well as other}} primates. Robert Francoeur notes that evidence of the missionary position's use appears in ancient pottery and art in the Fertile Crescent {{as well as in the}} art of Early Greeks, Romans, Peruvians, Indians, Chinese and Japanese. The majority of the positions described in the Kama Sutra involve the woman lying on her back with her legs in a variety of positions. According to Canongate, ancient art shows missionary as being less popular than woman-on-top positions in Ur, Greece, Rome, Peru, India, China and Japan. But Francoeur states that the ancient Chinese preferred male-on-top because of their belief that males are born face down and women face up. Kagaba natives in Colombia preferred missionary because of the stability it offers; they believed that if the woman moved during intercourse, the earth would slip off the shoulders of the four giants who <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> above the waters. Some Kerala tribes believe that the male-on-top position is the only way to conceive warriors.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing {{the episode}} for IGN, Travis Fickett extolled Summer Glau's performance, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> {{as an example}} of her acting ability keeping the whole series from failing. [...] Fickett also {{explained}} that [...] "Self Made Man" [...] received better ratings than the preceding episodes of the series' second season. [...] At the website Television Without Pity (TWoP), the staff review rated the episode a [...] "C", and specifically took issue with the suspension of disbelief required for Cameron's ability to find anything and everything about the Myron Stark storyline in a closed public library; , 757 of their readers awarded it an average grade of [...] "B+".|$|E

500|$|Olga left Gatchina for {{the first}} time in the early fall of 1888 when the {{imperial}} family visited the Caucasus. On 29 October, their return train approached the small town of Borki at speed. Olga's parents and their four older children were eating lunch in the dining-car when the train lurched violently and came off the rails. The carriage was torn open; the heavy iron roof caved in, and the wheels and floor of the car were sliced off. The Tsar crawled out from beneath the crushed roof, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> with [...] "a Herculean effort" [...] so that the others could escape. There were 21 fatalities. Empress Marie helped tend the wounded, and made makeshift bandages from her own clothes. An official investigation found that the crash was an accident, but it was widely assumed that two bombs had been planted on the line.|$|E
500|$|Rendering lead Jessica McMackin {{spoke about}} the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: [...] "In {{addition}} to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and {{you want to get a}} feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall." [...] Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: [...] "The ground-locking system is one of the things I’m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On Cars, this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{university}} adopted {{blue and}} white as its official colors in 1892. Originally, however, UK students had decided on blue and light yellow prior to the Kentucky-Centre College football game on December 19, 1887. The shade of blue, which is close to a royal blue, was chosen when a student asked the question, [...] "What color blue?" [...] At the time, Richard C. Stoll (who lettered in football at UK in 1889–94) pulled off his necktie and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> The students then adopted that particular shade of blue. A year later, UK students officially dropped the light yellow color for white because the two colors did not look good together.|$|E
2500|$|Hart {{began dating}} singer Pink after meeting her in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the 2001 X Games. After {{four years of}} dating, Pink {{proposed}} to Hart in June 2005 via a pit board {{during one of his}} races in Mammoth Lakes, California. She was holding a sign initially asking [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] At first he ignored her and completed another lap of the race; it was only when she changed the sign and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> again with it now saying, [...] "I'm serious!", that Hart pulled out of the race to pick Pink up. They married at the Four Seasons resort in Costa Rica on January 7, 2006.|$|E
2500|$|Late in Game 2 of the Conference Finals in Chicago, Vancouver Interim Head Coach Roger Neilson, {{frustrated}} {{with what he}} felt was the poor officiating in the game, placed a white towel {{on the end of}} a hockey stick and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in a gesture mocking surrender (waving the white flag). The players on the Canucks' bench followed suit. When the series shifted to Vancouver for the next two games, the team's fans cheered them on by waving white towels above their heads. The habit stuck, becoming an original Canuck fan tradition now seen across the league and in other sports, known as [...] "Towel Power." [...] The Canucks proceeded to win the series in five games, making it to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in their history.|$|E

2500|$|Along {{with this}} match, several others saw tributes toward Speed. The only other Premier League match played {{that day was}} between Liverpool and Manchester City. Craig Bellamy of Liverpool was {{withdrawn}} from Liverpool's squad by his manager Kenny Dalglish, as he was too affected by the news to play. Bellamy played with Speed for Newcastle United and Wales, where Speed had also been his manager. Dalglish himself had signed Speed for Newcastle, and expressed his sadness at the news, saying that he thought Speed {{was not only a}} great footballer but also a great person. Another of Speed's former teammates, Hugo Viana, also paid tribute to him. Viana, a Portuguese international played alongside Speed at Newcastle from 2002 to 2004. After his team Braga had lost 3–2 to Porto, Viana displayed a shirt reading [...] "Gary Rest in Peace". Gareth Bale, who played for Speed at Wales, also gave Speed a last tribute. After scoring Tottenham's opening goal in a 3–0 win at home to Bolton, Bale took off his left boot and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to reveal the stitched words [...] "RIP Gary Speed".|$|E
