In conical fit abutments, {{the collar of}} the abutment sits inside the implant which allows a stronger junction between implant and abutment and a better seal against bacteria into the implant body. To improve the gingival seal around the abutment collar, a narrowed collar on the abutment is used, referred to as platform switching.

40|$|The author {{proposes a}} {{preliminary}} {{design for a}} 40 MeV fixed energy proton cyclotron with a maximum intensity of 5 mA. Special emphasis is put on a simple and reliable design, and on low operating costs. The proposed cyclotron has four separated sectors and is basically similar to the SIN injector II. However, for this energy acceptable betatron frequencies are obtained up to the maximum intensity with 36 degrees rather than 26 degrees sector angle. Two 45 degrees dees provide an average energy gain of 1 MeV/turn, with two <b>flat-topping</b> cavities. The main acceleration frequency is 30 MHz (<b>flat-topping</b> at 90 MHz), allowing the use of inexpensive RF power amplifiers. The electrostatic deflector includes a low-interception septum, made of carbon fiber wires.

40|$|ABSTRACT The multi-disciplinary {{accelerator}} based {{facilities at}} iThemba LABS are used intensively for nuclear physics experiments, radiotherapy {{and the production}} of radioisotopes. To increase the beam intensity for radioisotope production and to improve the beam quality of the 66 MeV proton beam, a double-gap horizontal half-wave <b>flat-topping</b> resonator has been developed for the separated-sector cyclotron to operate at the associated fixed frequency. This type of flattopping resonator has never before been implemented in a cyclotron and this study is the first to show that it can be done, featuring a special characteristic not offered by other types. The resonator is reviewed against the other types of resonators that are already in use at other institutes around the world. The <b>flat-topping</b> voltage of the selected type has a sinusoidal half-wave distribution along a radial line in each of its acceleration gaps with the nodal points located on the injection and extraction orbits. The <b>flat-topping</b> voltage therefore progressively increases from zero at both of the two most critical orbits in a cyclotron to a maximum at about halfway between them. As a result will this resonator, apart from its basic function to reduce the energy spread in the beam, not decrease the orbit separation at the injection and extraction orbits in the cyclotron, {{as is the case with}} other types of <b>flat-topping</b> resonators. This advantageous feature implies that the beam pattern in the cyclotron is not affected in the regions of the delicate injection and extraction components and therefore will these components or the operational control of the beam not require any modification to accommodate the resonator. In order to design a resonator that will meet our requirements, the theory of the beam dynamics and resonator characteristics were studied to ascertain the expected improvement in beam quality and beam intensity when a <b>flat-topping</b> resonator is implemented with the cyclotron. All resonator types were considered and studied in terms of their power dissipation, voltage distribution, harmonic number, space requirements and influence on the beam. The horizontal half-wave resonator type, with two acceleration gaps, was selected as the most suitable for our application, because of its preferred electromagnetic characteristics and its geometric shape that permits the installation inside an existing vacuum chamber through an existing flange. Initially a half-scale resonator model was build to test the feasibility of such a resonator and also to verify the calculation methods. Transmission line methods and numerical field analysis in 3 D were applied to determine the resonator characteristics. In the former method a computer program, POISSON, was used to calculate curvilinear squares on sections through a triangular-shaped transmission line and in the latter method a commercial computer program, SOPRANO, was used. SOPRANO is part of an internationally acclaimed suite of programs and the acquired knowledge and skill to use this state-of-the-art software for the studying and designing of such and other electromagnetic devices also put the institute amongst the front-runners in the world. The calculated characteristics of the half- and full-scale resonator models, the study of the different electromagnetic modes that resonate in close proximity to the required frequency, the heat transport modelling and the theory and implementation of the coupling and tuning devices are all in good agreement with their respective measured results and are reported in this document. This study lead the way to have the first-ever double-gap horizontal half-wave <b>flat-topping</b> resonator in a cyclotron successfully commissioned at iThemba LABS and the first tests with beam report very stable operation. Accelerator physicists now have another option to utilize for the establishing of flat-topped acceleration voltages...|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} {{details and}} test {{results of the}} 2 XIIB <b>flat-topping</b> modules are described. Both practical design and construction considerations as well as fabrication techniques are discussed. Power for the main compression coils of the 2 XIIB is derived by discharging a high-voltage capacitor bank and then crowbarring at the current peak to obtain L/R decay in the fields. To study plasma confinement under these quasi steady-state conditions, {{it is necessary to}} hold the compression-coil current constant for 10 ms. This is done by supplying only the I$sup 2 $R losses of the system, using a low-voltage bank. The low- voltage bank consists of 48 modules each supplying 20, 000 A at +- 450 V to each compression coil for a total of 480, 000 A.

The family home was then situated between 8th and 9th Ave., on 31st St. in Manhattan. The Martin clan moved way up to Central Harlem on Edgecombe Ave. in 1891. They relocated within Central Harlem, to 129th St. and 5th Ave. in 1898. They belonged to the 24th Street M.E. Church (till 1891) and Calvary M.E. Church (till 1908). Paul's father Robert was the superintendent of their Sunday schools. Martin immensely enjoyed drawing as a boy. He studied commercial art at the National Academy of Design in New York City from 1902-06 (summer only 1906). He began working for the New York Tribune around 1905. This led to a seven-year stint as its art manager. Martin and family members moved from Upper Manhattan to Maplewood, New Jersey in 1908. He started competing in sanctioned tennis tournaments one year later. Martin married Lauretta Willey in 1912. (Her brother would own the Willey Book Co.) Their first rented home was in the University Heights section of the Bronx in 1912. They relocated a block away in 1915. He was employed with the O. J. Gude Company and Gotham Studios from c.1915–20. These two were giants in the advertising world. Martin joined the Artists' Guild and went freelance in early 1921. Paul and Lauretta moved from the Bronx to a rural area of Millwood, New York, in 1925. Their first owned home doubled as a working studio (upper floor) from 1925 to 1932. Its centerpiece was a long <b>flat-top</b> table that held the canvases, drawing pads, paint brushes and tubes. Also nearby were art books, easels and props for photo shoots.
