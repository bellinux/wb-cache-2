40|$|In {{the present}} study various product {{development}} trends in the food industry are reviewed with the main focus on convenience, organic and functional foods. Also highlighted are differences between the U. S. and Europe in terms of consumer habits and food supply trends. Through exploring the reasons behind differences in the extent of product innovation, the author illustrates the different role <b>convenience</b> <b>products</b> have in the US and European markets. Also revealed is the relationship linking <b>convenience</b> <b>products,</b> gluttony, and obesity. In the USA a third generation of <b>convenience</b> <b>products</b> has already appeared with the dual aim of delivering convenience and health.

40|$|Abstract This {{empirical}} research investigates {{the impact of}} windowsill placement on the compulsive buying behavior of consumers on three different types of <b>products</b> i. e., <b>convenience</b> <b>products,</b> shopping products, and specialty products. Positive effect of windowsill placement on all three types of product categories has been hypothesized. The categorical regression (Optimal scaling) {{was used to test}} the hypotheses. The data was collected via self administered questionnaire from Pakistan through systematic random sampling, and the sample consisted of 500 respondents. The results of data analysis supported only the 1 st hypothesis which highlighted that placement of products in shopping centers has an impact of unplanned buying of consumers for <b>convenience</b> <b>products.</b> While rest of the two hypotheses regarding shopping and <b>convenience</b> <b>products</b> were not supported by the data.

40|$|The paper explores how {{the complex}} {{relationship}} between consumption and production evolves as women enact {{their roles as}} mothers, and reconstruct their self-identity through their use or avoidance of <b>convenience</b> <b>products.</b> Qualitative, individual interviews are used to allow an in-depth analysis of the life stories {{of the group of}} respondents. An interpretive analysis reveals the purpose, patterns and rules followed by these individuals in their actions. Convenience consumption empowers these ‘mothers of invention’ to instrumental and emotional autonomy through their rejection of unnecessary drudgery, and enables them to negotiate the role of caretaker within the family. The implications of the study suggest that there is a role for marketing to remove any vestiges of guilt in convenience consumption by addressing the issues of sustainability, nutrition, quality and value in <b>convenience</b> <b>products.</b> The paper reveals the importance of reinforcing the connections between a better quality of family care and love. The paper also demonstrates the importance of the interactions of the family members on convenience consumption. These findings are important for marketing practitioners and academics researching family consumption. ...|$|R
