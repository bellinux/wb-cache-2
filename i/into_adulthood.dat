40|$|The Hutchinson Study of High School Smoking was {{the first}} {{randomized}} trial to show effectiveness of a smoking cessation intervention on 6 -months prolonged smoking abstinence at one year post-intervention in a large population-based sample of adolescent smokers. An important question remains: Do the positive effects from teen smoking cessation interventions seen at up to 12 months post-intervention endure <b>into</b> young <b>adulthood?</b> This study examines {{for the first time}} whether such positive early effects from teen smoking cessation intervention can endure <b>into</b> young <b>adulthood</b> in the absence of additional intervention. High school smokers (n = 2, 151) were proactively recruited into the trial from fifty randomly selected Washington State high schools randomized to the experimental (Motivational Interviewing + Cognitive Behavioral Skills Training telephone counseling intervention) or control (no intervention) condition. These smokers were followed to 7 years post high school to ascertain rates of six-year prolonged smoking abstinence in young adulthood. All statistical tests are two-sided. No evidence of intervention impact at seven years post high school was observed for the main endpoint of six-year prolonged abstinence, neither among all smokers (14. 2 % in the experimental condition vs. 13. 1 % in the control condition, difference = + 1. 1 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = - 3. 4 to 5. 8, p =. 61), nor among the subgroups of daily smokers and less-than-daily smokers, nor among other a priori subgroups. But, observed among males was some evidence of an intervention impact on two endpoints related to progress towards quitting: reduction in number of days smoked in the past month, and increase in the length of the longest quit attempt in the past year. There was no evidence from this trial among adolescent smokers that positive effectiveness of the proactive telephone intervention for smoking abstinence, observed previously at one year post-intervention, was sustained for the long-term <b>into</b> young <b>adulthood.</b> In light of the positive short-term effectiveness consistently observed from this and other trials for teen smokers, together with the lack of evidence from this study that such short-term impact can endure <b>into</b> young <b>adulthood,</b> sustained interventions that continue <b>into</b> young <b>adulthood</b> should be developed and tested for long-term impact.

5|$|Outcome {{is related}} to the extent and {{duration}} of lead exposure. Effects of lead on the physiology of the kidneys and blood are generally reversible; its effects on the central nervous system are not.

Children with lead poisoning may thus have adverse health, cognitive, and behavioral effects that follow them <b>into</b> <b>adulthood.</b>|$|E
40|$|Objectives. To explore if self-perceived {{overweight}} {{in normal}} weight adolescents influence their weight development <b>into</b> young <b>adulthood</b> and if so, whether physical activity moderates this association. Methods. A {{longitudinal study of}} 1196 normal weight adolescents (13 – 19 [*]yrs) who were followed up as young adults (24 – 30 [*]yrs) in the HUNT study. Lifestyle and health issues were assessed employing questionnaires, and standardized anthropometric measurements were taken. Chi square calculations and regression analyses were performed to investigate the associations between self-perceived overweight and change in BMI or waist circumference (WC) adjusted for age, age squared, sex, and other relevant cofactors. Results. Adolescents, defined as being normal weight, but who perceived themselves as overweight had a larger weight gain <b>into</b> young <b>adulthood</b> than adolescents who perceived themselves as normal weight (difference in BMI: 0. 66 units [CI 95 %: 0. 1, 1. 2] and in WC: 3. 46 [*]cm [CI 95 %: 1. 8, 5. 1]). Level of physical activity was not found to moderate this association. Conclusions. This study reveals that self-perceived overweight during adolescence may affect development of weight from adolescence <b>into</b> young <b>adulthood.</b> This {{highlights the importance of}} also focusing on body image in public health interventions against obesity, favouring a “healthy” body weight taking into account natural differences in body shapes...|$|R

5|$|As with {{obesity in}} adults, many factors {{contribute}} to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Changing diet and decreasing physical activity {{are believed to be}} the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child obesity. Because childhood obesity often persists <b>into</b> <b>adulthood</b> and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, children who are obese are often tested for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver. Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques, although efforts to increase activity in children have had little success. In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group. Multi-component behaviour change interventions that include changes to dietary and physical activity may reduce BMI in the short term in children aged 6 to 11 years, although the benefits are small and quality of evidence is low.|$|E
