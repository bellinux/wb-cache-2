5|$|Several German art {{experts have}} {{attempted}} to refute all the claims made by Hawass, pointing to the 1924 document discussing the pact between Borchardt and the Egyptian authorities, though, as <b>discussed</b> <b>earlier,</b> Borchardt {{has been accused of}} foul play in the deal. The German authorities have also argued the bust is too fragile to transport and that the legal arguments for the repatriation were insubstantial. According to The Times, Germany may be concerned that lending the bust to Egypt would mean its permanent departure from Germany.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants are {{generally}} intolerant of myrmecophiles (which are insects or other organisms that share positive interspecies associations with ants) {{living in their}} colonies, but Cyclotorna larvae are known to dwell in colonies. Although Sphallomorpha larvae sometimes prey on workers as <b>discussed</b> <b>earlier,</b> some are inquilines {{and live in the}} nest commensally. Unused or abandoned areas inside colonies are sometimes occupied by other species of ants and in some cases, termites. Meat ants may deliberately destroy the colonies of the termite Amitermes laurensis if competition between the two intensify.|$|E

25|$|This {{algorithm}} differs {{slightly from}} the one <b>discussed</b> <b>earlier,</b> because before eliminating a variable, it first exchanges rows to move the entry with the largest absolute value to the pivot position.

25|$|A {{mixture of}} 5% water with 95% {{tetrahydrofuran}} {{is an example}} of an azeotrope that can be economically separated using a pressure swing – a swing in this case between 1 atm and 8 atm. By contrast the composition of the water to ethanol azeotrope <b>discussed</b> <b>earlier</b> is not affected enough by pressure to be easily separated using pressure swings and instead, an entrainer may be added that either modifies the azeotropic composition and exhibits immiscibility with one of the components, or extractive distillation may be used.|$|E
25|$|As <b>discussed</b> <b>earlier,</b> {{momentary}} attractions (or repulsions) between particles have {{an effect}} on gas dynamics. In physical chemistry, the name given to these intermolecular forces is van der Waals force. These forces {{play a key role in}} determining physical properties of a gas such as viscosity and flow rate (see physical characteristics section). Ignoring these forces in certain conditions (see Kinetic-molecular theory) allows a real gas to be treated like an ideal gas. This assumption allows the use of ideal gas laws which greatly simplifies calculations.|$|E

25|$|In special relativity, mass-energy {{is closely}} {{connected}} to momentum. As we have <b>discussed</b> <b>earlier</b> {{in the section}} on Energy and momentum, just as space and time are different aspects of a more comprehensive entity called spacetime, mass-energy and momentum are merely different aspects of a unified, four-dimensional quantity called four-momentum. In consequence, if mass-energy {{is a source of}} gravity, momentum must also be a source. The inclusion of momentum as a source of gravity leads to the prediction that moving or rotating masses can generate fields analogous to the magnetic fields generated by moving charges, a phenomenon known as gravitomagnetism.|$|E
25|$|While {{the methods}} behind {{collecting}} bite mark {{evidence at the}} scene are leading toward greater standardization, the methodology behind analyzing bite marks is extremely variable because it depends upon the preference of the specific odontologist. As <b>discussed</b> <b>earlier,</b> there are several methods used to compare bite marks ranging from life sized photographs to computer enhanced 3-dimensional imaging. These methods vary in precision and accuracy, {{and there is no}} set standard by which to compare or analyze them. The lack of analytical standards leads to a wide array of interpretation with any bite mark evidence. Some odontologists even disagree on whether or not a mark on the body {{is the result of a}} bite. Therefore, the interpretation of evidence lies largely on the expertise of the forensic odontologist handling the case.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the onset}} of the Green Revolution {{in the middle of the}} last century, vast amounts of {{nitrogen}} fertilizers have been produced and introduced to almost all agricultural systems. This has led to increases in plant available nitrogen in ecosystems around the world due to agricultural runoff and wind-driven fertilization. As <b>discussed</b> <b>earlier,</b> nitrogen can have a significant positive effect on the level and rate of soil respiration. Increases in soil nitrogen have been found to increase plant dark respiration, stimulate specific rates of root respiration and increase total root biomass. and nitrogen supply over four years of growth. Global Change Biology. 6, 13-24. This is because high nitrogen rates are associated with high plant growth rates. High plant growth rates will lead to the increased respiration and biomass found in the study. With this increase in productivity, an increase in soil activities and therefore respiration can be assured.|$|E
25|$|Resonance {{is simple}} to {{understand}} if {{the spring and}} mass are viewed as energy storage elements – with the mass storing kinetic energy and the spring storing potential energy. As <b>discussed</b> <b>earlier,</b> when the mass and spring have no external force acting on them they transfer energy back and forth at a rate equal to the natural frequency. In other words, to efficiently pump energy into both mass and spring requires that the energy source feed the energy in at a rate equal to the natural frequency. Applying a force to the mass and spring is similar to pushing a child on swing, a push is needed at the correct moment to make the swing get higher and higher. As {{in the case of}} the swing, the force applied need not be high to get large motions, but must just add energy to the system.|$|E

25|$|Currently {{there are}} two Poisson solvers {{implemented}} in BioMOCA based on the finite difference method. One uses the pre-conditioned Conjugate Gradient scheme (pCG) and is used by default. The later is borrowed from an APBS solver, which uses a V-multi-grid scheme. Other than the numerical approach to solve the Poisson equation, {{the main difference between}} the two solvers is on how they address the permittivity in the system. In the first solver, a dielectric value is assigned to each cell in the grid, while in the APBS solver the dielectric coefficients are defined on the grid nodes. As <b>discussed</b> <b>earlier</b> box integration method is used in the pCG solver, which allows us to treat the Poisson equation in the most accurate way. Even though a full multigrid solver based on box-integration method has been under development, there is a neat way to reuse the already exiting code and treat the ion channel systems.|$|E
25|$|Of Canals’ written {{theological}} output the Josephologist thread {{is treated}} most extensively; it was dedicated two books, a lengthy San José, Patriarca del Pueblo de Dios (1982) and {{an anthology of}} texts on St. Joseph, titled San José en la fe de la Iglesia (2007). Mundo histórico y Reino de Dios (2006) is a lecture in theology of history, while Los siete primeros concilios. La formulación de la ortodoxia católica (2003) discusses evolution of the early Catholic doctrine. The work which falls into none of the fields <b>discussed</b> <b>earlier</b> is En torno al diálogo católico-protestante (1966); written in course of Vaticanum II it advanced a somewhat competitive approach towards ecumenism and claimed that stress on components unifying Christian faiths comes {{at a cost of}} de-emphasizing the core message. Last but not least, {{for more than half a}} century Canals contributed to a number of Catholic reviews, mostly Cristiandad, and remained in its editorial board.|$|E
25|$|In {{studies of}} {{molecular}} and cellular biology {{it is often}} desirable to artificially induce fusion. Although {{this can be accomplished}} with the addition of calcium as <b>discussed</b> <b>earlier,</b> this procedure is often not feasible because calcium regulates many other biochemical processes and its addition would be a strong confound. Also, as mentioned, calcium induces massive aggregation as well as fusion. The addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) causes fusion without significant aggregation or biochemical disruption. This procedure is now used extensively, for example by fusing B-cells with myeloma cells. The resulting “hybridoma” from this combination expresses a desired antibody as determined by the B-cell involved, but is immortalized due to the myeloma component. The mechanism of PEG fusion has not been definitively identified, but some researchers believe that the PEG, by binding a large number of water molecules, effectively decreases the chemical activity of the water and thus dehydrates the lipid headgroups. Fusion can also be artificially induced through electroporation in a process known as electrofusion. It is believed that this phenomenon results from the energetically active edges formed during electroporation, which can act as the local defect point to nucleate stalk growth between two bilayers.|$|E
