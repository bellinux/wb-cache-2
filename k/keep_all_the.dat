5|$|Edwards {{then tried}} to change the deal with Dart. Instead of {{dividing}} the smuggled slaves between the two men, Edwards tried to <b>keep</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> slaves and instead repay the money Dart had advanced him, with some interest. Dart sued, and at the trial in March 1839 Edwards offered two forged documents claiming that Dart had sold {{his interest in the}} slaves to Edwards. In forging the documents, Edwards originally secured Dart's signature on a document written in a type of ink that could later be chemically removed. After Dart signed the document, Edwards then removed the original wording of the document and substituted a deed selling Dart's interest in the land and slaves. The documents were determined to be forgeries and on April 2, 1840, Dart was awarded $89,000. Edwards fled the Republic of Texas to the United States.|$|E

25|$|In October the Swedish Ministry of Communications {{gave the}} final {{permission}} for LKAB {{to take over}} operations in their own right. On 26 October, SJ and NSB signed a new five-year contract with LKAB where the latter would purchase transport services from the two state railway. The annual price had then been reduced from SEK 650 to 400 million. Political commentators stated that the agreement allowed LKAB to <b>keep</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> profit in the line and introduce new cost savings, while SJ and NSB kept face by keeping the operating contract. The price reduction would mean that both NSB and SJ would have to lay off employees.|$|E
25|$|The systems {{described}} above are ideal types: real systems may present themselves as hybrids of those categories. Consider, for example, that {{the production of}} jeans involves initially carding, spinning, dyeing and weaving, then cutting the fabric in different shapes and assembling the parts in pants or jackets by combining the fabric with thread, zippers and buttons, finally finishing and distressing the pants/jackets before being shipped to stores. The beginning {{can be seen as}} process production, the middle as part production and the end again as process production: it's unlikely that a single company will <b>keep</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> stages of production under a single roof, therefore the problem of vertical integration and outsourcing arises. Most products require, from a supply chain perspective, both process production and part production.|$|E
25|$|The vibrato {{sound is}} incredible, {{and it took}} a long time. I put down the rhythm track on an Epiphone Casino through a Fender Twin Reverb without vibrato. Then we played the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. We had to <b>keep</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> amps {{vibrating}} in time to the track and each other, so we had to keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... I wish I could remember exactly how we did the slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a harmonizer, set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|E

25|$|During the {{breeding}} season, males {{that fail to}} secure territories and harems, most often subadults, will cause group raids {{in an attempt to}} change the status quo and gain access to the females. Group raids are more common on sandy beaches than rocky ones. These raids cause chaos in {{the breeding}} harems, often splitting mothers from their young. The resident males try to fight off the raiders and <b>keep</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> females in their territorial boundaries. Raiders are often unsuccessful in securing a female, but some are able to capture some females or even stay in the breeding area with one or more females. Sometimes, an invading male abducts pups, possibly as an attempt to control the females. They also take pups as substitutes for mature females. Subadults herd their captured pups and prevent them from escaping, much like adult males do to females. A pup may be mounted by its abductor, but intromission does not occur. While abducting pups does not give males immediate reproductive benefits, these males may gain experience in controlling females. Pups are sometimes severely injured or killed during abductions.|$|E

500|$|Writer, director, and series creator Chris Carter based {{the episode}} around an idea he and fellow writer Frank Spotnitz {{had been working}} on, {{featuring}} a haunted house. The only scene that the two had completely planned out was the climax, which features Mulder and Scully pulling themselves across the floor, bleeding profusely. Carter wanted to <b>keep</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> action on one set, with the episode featuring only one location. To do this, production designer Corey Kaplan proposed that the episode be filmed in Scully's apartment, a set that the crew had not used for season six. Carter, however, wanting to keep the haunted house motif, asked Kaplan if she could design a mansion set. Kaplan was tasked with designing a set that was [...] "bleak, but not too bleak [...] decrepit, but not too decrepit," [...] and [...] "deserted, but not too deserted." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the same}} fashion as the {{original}} Star Wars films, the story opens with a large, yellow crawl of text, with the text in this variation calling out 20th Century Fox for their lack of foresight in terms of merchandising rights, thus allowing George Lucas and Lucasfilm to <b>keep</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> rights to every film in the Star Wars franchise. The text then addresses the stockholders of 20th Century Fox, and cites Family Guys two cancellations as {{another example of the}} company's short-sighted decisions, and spending budget money in a useless manner. As the Imperial Fleet approaches, a Star Destroyer deploys Elroy Jetson, a character from the Hanna-Barbera animated sitcom The Jetsons, along with a series of probe droids. Elroy Jetson proceeds to the Little Dipper School, in imitation of the original intro to The Jetsons. One of the probe droids, portrayed by Joe Swanson, then lands in the snow near Luke Skywalker. Luke mistakes the droid for a meteorite and approaches the device, before being attacked by a snow beast, which looks like Cookie Monster from PBS' Sesame Street.

500|$|For Beaufort and {{the leading}} Cambridge [...] "gentlemen of science" [...] the {{opportunity}} for a naturalist to join the expedition fitted with their drive to revitalise British government policy on science. This elite disdained research done for money and felt that natural philosophy was for gentlemen, not tradesmen. The officer class of the Army and Navy provided a way to ascend this hierarchy; it was commonly the Ship's Surgeon who collected specimens on voyages, and Robert McCormick had secured the official position of surgeon on the Beagle after taking part in earlier expeditions and studying natural history. A sizeable collection had considerable social value, attracting wide public interest, and McCormick aspired to fame as an exploring naturalist. Collections made by the Ship's Surgeon and other officers were government property, though the Admiralty was not consistent on this, and went to important London establishments, usually the British Museum. The Admiralty instructions for the first voyage had required officers [...] "to use their best diligence in increasing the Collections in each ship: the whole of which must be understood to belong to the Public", but on the second voyage this requirement was omitted, and the officers were free to <b>keep</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> specimens for themselves.|$|E
500|$|For the 2009 {{version of}} Friday the 13th, effects artist Scott Stoddard took {{inspiration}} from Carl Fullerton's design in Friday the 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini's work in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Stoddard {{wanted to make}} sure that Jason appeared human and not like a monster. Stoddard's vision of Jason includes hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face, but he attempted to craft Jason's look in a way that would allow for a more human side to be seen. Stoddard took inspiration from the third and fourth films when designing Jason's hockey mask. The make-up artist managed to acquire an original set piece, which he studied and later sculpted. Although he had a model of one of the original masks, Stoddard did not want to replicate it in its entirety. As Stoddard explains, [...] "Because I didn't want to take something that already existed, there were things I thought were great, but there were things I wanted to change a bit. Make it custom, but <b>keep</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> fundamental designs. Especially the markings on the forehead and cheeks. Age them down a bit, break them up." [...] In the end, Stoddard crafted six versions of the mask, each with varying degrees of wear.|$|E

500|$|Unlike EastEnders, E20 uses {{incidental}} music, which Scott Matthewman of The Stage said {{makes it}} feel like an episode of Hollyoaks, a Channel 4 soap opera targeted at a teen audience. A remix of the EastEnders theme tune was created for the series, {{with members of the}} public submitting remixes in a competition held on the BBC website. The competition opened on 11 November 2009 and was officially launched on 13 November by Annie Mac on her BBC Radio 1 show. More than 250 entries were submitted. They were reduced to four and judged by Sathe, Santer, Keillor, original theme tune composer Simon May, and BBC Radio 1Xtra's DJ Ace. The winner, 21-year-old Carl Darling, was announced on 4 December 2009. He said [...] "I was very excited to hear that my track was chosen by such an eclectic judging panel. And to spend time in the BBC studios and walking around the Square was phenomenal. I have grown up hearing Simon May's original theme tune and watching Albert Square and the iconic Queen Vic, so I feel very privileged {{to be a part of}} EastEnders: E20 history!" [...] Darling explained that he wanted to <b>keep</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> [...] "essential features" [...] of the original theme, but to make a grimy drum and bass version.|$|E
500|$|For Jason's wardrobe, Mears {{was given}} a pair of combat boots and a [...] "high-priced t-shirt" [...] that allowed the special effects make-up to be seen through holes in the shirt.

Mears {{wanted to use the}} hunting jacket, but the creative team liked the way the military jacket billowed as he was making his [...] "kill movements." [...] The top of the hunting jacket was removed and placed {{over the top of the}} military jacket. Mears called it a [...] "giant Frankenstein jacket." [...] He describes Jason as leaner in this film because the character does not eat much. A leaner Jason was deemed more functional and allowed more emphasis to be placed on the hump on his back. Stoddard was inspired by the third and fourth films when designing Jason's hockey mask. Using an original mold, Stoddard made six new versions of the mask. He said, [...] "Because I didn't want to take something that already existed. There [...] were things I thought were great, but there were things I wanted to change a bit.

Later, elements of the North Vietnamese 3rd ‘Gold Star’ Division [...] secured a section of Highway 19 at Thuong An that connected with Bridge no.13 at Dong An Khe, killing about 300 South Vietnamese soldiers.
