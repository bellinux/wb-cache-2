5|$|The Blue Jays and the Cleveland Indians {{currently}} {{hold the}} record for the longest Opening Day game in Major League history.

5|$|The Yankees chose Ruffing {{as their}} {{starting}} pitcher for Opening Day in 1931. During the 1931 season, Ruffing had a 16–14 win-loss {{record with a}} 4.41 ERA. The Yankees finished the season in second place. On August 13, 1932, Ruffing threw a complete game shutout and hit a <b>home</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tenth inning off of Washington Senators' pitcher Tommy Thomas to give the New York Yankees a 1–0 victory. Ruffing became the first pitcher in major league history to win a game 1–0, hit a <b>home</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, and strike out ten or more batters. Two other pitchers have since achieved this feat: Early Wynn in 1957, and Yovani Gallardo, who did it in 2009. Ruffing won 18 games during the 1932 season. He had a 3.09ERA, second in the AL only to Lefty Grove's 2.84. Ruffing had 190 strikeouts, which led the AL. The Yankees won their first pennant since 1928. Ruffing won his first World Series game during the 1932 World Series against the Chicago Cubs. He started Game One, and the Yankees swept the Cubs four games to zero.|$|E

At the beginning of May, he moved over to shortstop to replace the injured Rentería; {{for most of the}} remainder of the season, he was the Giants' starting shortstop. He hit a game-winning two-run home run on September 5 against Jonathan Broxton, turning a 4–3 deficit into a 5–4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. On September 23, Uribe hit a grand slam against Ryan Dempster and a two-run <b>home</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second inning against the Cubs for a total of six RBIs, helping the Giants win 13–0.|$|E
5|$|Kemp {{was placed}} on the {{disabled}} list on May 14 because of a hamstring injury, ending his streak of 399 consecutive games played, which was the longest in the majors at the time. After his DL stint, he promptly re-injured his hamstring two days later while running the bases, and returned to the DL. Despite missing about 2 months with injuries, Kemp was voted by the fans as a starter for the 2012 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. As he was still on the disabled list, Kemp did not play in the game but he did participate in the Home Run Derby for the second straight year, hitting one <b>home</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Derby. Kemp finally returned to the Dodgers lineup on July 13, after missing about two months with his hamstring injury.|$|E

5|$|On June 17, Thome {{became the}} fourth major league player to hit 100 home runs with three {{different}} teams, joining Reggie Jackson, Darrell Evans and Rodriguez. Six days later, Thome hit a pinch-hit walk-off <b>home</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ninth inning off of Jake McGee to beat the Tampa Bay Rays, 7–6. This was Thome's 609th home run, tying Sammy Sosa for seventh all-time in home runs while also setting the new record for most walk-off home runs (13) in the modern era. Thome's last game as a Phillie was an afternoon loss to the Miami Marlins on June 30.

5|$|On {{the first}} pitch thrown by Harvey, Alcides Escobar hit an inside-the-park home run, {{the first in a}} World Series game since Mule Haas in the 1929 World Series, and the first hit by a leadoff batter since Patsy Dougherty did it for the Boston Americans in the 1903 World Series. In the fourth inning, Murphy {{recorded}} the Mets' first hit, and later scored their first run on a hit by Travis d'Arnaud. Curtis Granderson hit a <b>home</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fifth inning to give the Mets a 2–1 lead. The Mets took a 3–1 lead {{in the top of the}} sixth when Michael Conforto drove in Yoenis Céspedes with a sacrifice fly. Mike Moustakas then saved a run with a diving stop and throw out to first to end the top of the sixth. Eric Hosmer reduced the lead to 3–2 with a sacrifice fly, and set a new Royals' postseason run batted in (RBI) record in the process. A single by Moustakas tied the game at three, but in the top of the eighth, Wilmer Flores reached on an fielding error by Hosmer, allowing Juan Lagares to score the go-ahead run and give the Mets a 4–3 lead. In the bottom of the ninth with the Mets 2 outs away from taking Game 1, Alex Gordon tied the game for the Royals with a home run to deep center field, as Jeurys Familia blew his first save in six postseason opportunities and his first since July 30. With the home run, Gordon became the first player since Scott Brosius in the 2001 World Series, and just the fifth player in history, to tie a World Series game on a <b>home</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ninth inning.|$|E
5|$|The Orioles {{decided to}} put Davis at first base {{full-time}} in 2013 and worked on his defense in spring training; later, Oriole coaches and teammates believed this helped Davis succeed at the plate as well. He set a personal home run goal before the season but refused to share it. On April 5, Davis set a new Major League record with 16 RBI {{in the first four}} games of a season. He also became the fourth MLB player in history to hit a <b>home</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first four games of the season (Nelson Cruz, Mark McGwire, Willie Mays), including a grand slam against Tyler Robertson in the fourth game, a 95 victory over the Minnesota Twins.|$|E
