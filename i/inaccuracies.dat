40|$|Aim of {{this work}} is to study the impact of <b>inaccuracy</b> in {{execution}} of required task (<b>inaccuracy</b> in subject’s behavioral response to experimental stimulation) by person who undergoes fMRI examination. The work is solved in several stages. First, theoretical analysis of <b>inaccuracy</b> in fMRI experiment was performed, and simulations with synthetic data were created. Several variables in general linear model and t-statistics were followed. We found that estimated effect size depends linearly on covariance between the corresponding columns of X and D matrices or their linear combination. The component of residual variance caused by <b>inaccuracy</b> is negligible at real-life noise levels. In such case, moreover, the dependence of t-statistics on <b>inaccuracy</b> becomes linear. Next, our theoretical results (dependencies/characteristics of variables) were verified using real data. All results were confirmed. Last, I focused on possible practical use of the uncovered characteristics and dependencies. Optimization of experimental design with respect to <b>inaccuracy,</b> correction of inaccurate results and reliability of inaccurate results are introduced and discussed. Especially, the calculation of maps of maximal tolerable <b>inaccuracy</b> can be useful to find robust or weak (tending to be not detected or to be significantly different from accurate value) activation in real fMRI experiments...|$|R

40|$|To {{meet the}} needs and demands of the costumer, {{accurate}} information about how much is available in stock is necessary. When {{the information in the}} system does not match the physical inventory, inventory <b>inaccuracy</b> occurs. Inventory <b>inaccuracy</b> is common among companies and may contribute to increased labor cost, excess inventory, production disruptions, waste of time, late deliveries, poor service and lost customers. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify contributing factors to inventory <b>inaccuracy</b> for business with outdoor storage. The study also aims to investigate how efficiency factors can reduce the inventory <b>inaccuracy</b> for business with outdoor storage. A case study was conducted to answer the purpose. A company in the steel industry was chosen to examine inventory <b>inaccuracy</b> on business with outdoor storage. During the case study a series of interviews was conducted with employees and managers. Together with information from observations and documents the information from the interviews was compiled into flowcharts. Inventory <b>inaccuracy</b> affects companies with in many ways and leads to inefficiency. Incorrect inventory leads to unnecessary work and costs and can also contribute to a reduced efficiency for business with outdoor storage.

40|$|This article {{focus on}} the {{behavior}} of a (Q,R) continuous-review lost-sales inventory model exposed to an inventory record <b>inaccuracy</b> (IRI). An unusual phenomenon has been observed which runs counter to certain empirical practices in the SMEs based on the principle that safety stock is only necessary for certain intervals in the data <b>inaccuracy</b> rate. Both analytical results and simulation modeling are proposed to investigate the relationship between the quality of service, safety stock and inventory <b>inaccuracy</b> under demand variations. It is shown that the service-level quality is a non-monotone function of the <b>inaccuracy</b> rate, i. e., the service-level quality increases up to an IRI level and subsequently decreases. Other <b>inaccuracy</b> distribution functions have produced the same phenomena with constant demand as well as with demand fluctuations. Finally, another noteworthy result also shows the same phenomenon between the function involving a level of safety stock defined by simulation and the function between the service-level quality and IRI.
