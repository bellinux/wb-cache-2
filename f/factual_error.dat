Moore argued that US officials simply made up the story to discredit the film as it portrays the US healthcare system in a negative light.|$|E
25|$|Japanese scholar Miya Noriko {{presumes that}} the year 1402 was a {{landmark}} for the reigning King Taejong {{of the newly}} founded Joseon Dynasty. After a bloody succession struggle, Taejong ascended to the throne in 1400. In 1401, he was officially recognized as King of Joseon by the Chinese Emperor {{for the first time}} in the dynasty's history. In the 6th month of 1402, Yi Hoe's map of Korea was offered in a ceremony to celebrate his birthday. Then the project to combine it with Chinese and Japanese maps reportedly started in the summer (4th-6th months). This would be of symbolic significance in demonstrating royal power. This hypothesis also explains the <b>factual</b> <b>error</b> about the map of Japan. It was during the reigns of Taejo (1st king) and Jeongjong (2nd) that the map was obtained in Japan, but the date was altered to Taejong's reign.|$|E
500|$|Edson Jones {{eventually}} {{published his}} {{findings on the}} Arnold family in 1915, demonstrating {{the accuracy of the}} Arnold family record, and then carefully revealing each inconsistency and <b>factual</b> <b>error</b> found in Somerby's pedigree. [...] In 1921, Fred Arnold summarized these findings and synthesized them into a coherent lineage of the Arnold family which is consistent with every known historical document, and presented his findings to the Rhode Island Historical Society. [...] To summarize the work of both Edson Jones and Fred Arnold, William Arnold was the son of Nicholas Arnold of Northover and Ilchester in Somerset based on the Arnold family record and the Northover parish register. [...] Arnold's mother was Alice Gully, and her parents were John and Alice Gully based on the same two documents. [...] These are the only known ancestors of William Arnold based on known historical records, and the parents of Nicholas Arnold have not been identified in any historical document.|$|E

2500|$|The writ of coram nobis {{may be used}} {{to address}} errors of fact outside the record that affect the {{validity}} and regularity of the decision itself and would have precluded the judgment from being rendered. [...] The writ is limited to errors involving facts that were not known to the court, were not withheld by the defendant, and would have prevented entry of the judgment. [...] A <b>factual</b> <b>error</b> does not include claims of newly discovered evidence because these types of claims would not have precluded the judgment from being entered in the first place. [...] A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel also involves legal error and is therefore not available.|$|E
2500|$|The case of Tameside {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{as being the}} first case which suggests a novel approach to <b>factual</b> <b>error.</b> There, the court asserted that administrative decisions may be reviewed {{if there has been}} a [...] "misunderstanding or ignorance of an established and relevant fact", and/or the decision-maker has acted [...] "outside his power, or unfairly, or upon an incorrect basis of fact". That is to say, even if it is for the decision-maker to evaluate the facts, the court can inquire into whether those facts exist and have been taken into account, whether the decision was made on a proper self-direction as to those facts, and whether irrelevant facts have been taken into account. Thus, the court's power in judicial review was broadened to allow for a limited factual inquiry. This ground of judicial review has been termed as an error of material fact.|$|E
