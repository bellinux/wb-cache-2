Materia have a limited number of uses before they must be recharged at one of the game's magic shops. Like party members, materia gain experience when used, and can be leveled up to a maximum level of nine. Characters can swap materia among themselves, with unequipped materia being used mid-battle <b>for</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> healing party members, compensating for the limited amount of healing items.|$|E
5|$|Forfeit: A {{player who}} cheats, or violates {{the rules of}} the game, or violates the rules {{specified}} for the particular tournament can be forfeited. In high-level tournaments, players have been forfeited <b>for</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> arriving late for the game (even by a matter of seconds), receiving a call or text on a cell phone, refusing to undergo a drug test, refusing to undergo a body search for electronic devices, and unsporting behavior (such as refusing to shake the opponent's hand).|$|E

5|$|Kulintang {{belongs to}} the larger unit/stratum of “knobbed gong-chime culture” {{prevalent}} in Southeast Asia. It {{is considered one of}} the region’s three major gong ensembles, alongside the gamelan of western Indonesia and piphat of Thailand, Burma, Cambodia and Laos, which use gongs and not wind or string instruments to carry the melodic part of the ensemble. Like the other two, kulintang music is primarily orchestral with several rhythmic parts orderly stacked one upon another. It is also based upon the pentatonic scale. However, kulintang music differs in many aspects from gamelan music, primarily in the way the latter constructs melodies within a framework of skeletal tones and prescribed time interval of entry for each instruments. The framework of kulintang music is more flexible and time intervals are nonexistent, allowing <b>for</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> improvisations to be more prevalent.|$|E
5|$|Lock Haven {{was laid}} out as a town in 1833, and it became the county seat in 1839, when the county was created out of parts of Lycoming and Centre {{counties}}. Incorporated as a borough in 1840 and as a city in 1870, Lock Haven prospered in the 19thcentury largely because of timber and transportation. The forests of Clinton County and counties upriver held a huge supply of white pine and hemlock as well as oak, ash, maple, poplar, cherry, beech, and magnolia. The wood was used locally <b>for</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> frame houses, shingles, canal boats, and wooden bridges, and whole logs were floated to Chesapeake Bay and on to Baltimore, to make spars for ships. Log driving and log rafting, competing forms of transporting logs to sawmills, began along the West Branch around 1800. By 1830, slightly before {{the founding of the}} town, the lumber industry was well established.|$|E

The mechanisms checked <b>for</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> a broken warp thread, broken weft thread, the shuttle going straight across, {{and if the}} shuttle was empty. Forty of these Northrop Looms or automatic looms could be operated by one skilled worker.|$|E

Pomeroy of Kansas who four years later in 1884 would seek the White House as the presidential candidate of the American Prohibition National Party. In the 1880 race, the Phelps/Pomeroy ticket garnered only 1,045 votes nationwide. They ran on an eleven-point platform calling <b>for</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> the prohibition of alcoholic beverages, the prohibition of all secret lodges, justice for Indians, demanding the Bible be a required text in all educational institutions; and {{the abolition of the}} electoral college.|$|E

25|$|The read/write memory between address 0100 {{hexadecimal}} and {{the lowest}} address of the BDOS was the Transient Program Area (TPA) available for CP/M application programs. Although all Z80 and 8080 processors could address 64 kilobytes of memory, the amount available for application programs could vary, depending {{on the design of}} the particular computer. Some computers used large parts of the address space <b>for</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> BIOS ROMs, or video display memory. As a result, some systems had more TPA memory available than others. Bank switching was a common technique that allowed systems to have a large TPA while switching out ROM or video memory space as needed. CP/M 3.0 allowed parts of the BDOS to be in bank-switched memory as well.|$|E
25|$|Ancient Chinese coinage {{includes}} {{some of the}} earliest known coins. These coins, used as early as the Spring and Autumn period (770–476 BCE), took the form of imitations of the cowrie shells that were used in ceremonial exchanges. The Spring and Autumn period also saw the introduction of the first metal coins; however, they were not initially round, instead being either knife shaped or spade shaped. Round metal coins with a round, and then later square hole in the center were first introduced around 350 BCE. The beginning of the Qin Dynasty (221–206 BCE), the first dynasty to unify China, saw the introduction of a standardised coinage for the whole Empire. Subsequent dynasties produced variations on these round coins throughout the imperial period. At first the distribution of the coinage was limited to use around the capital city district, but {{by the beginning of the}} Han Dynasty, coins were widely used <b>for</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> paying taxes, salaries and fines.|$|E
