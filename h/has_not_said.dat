25|$|Decker {{was five}} months {{pregnant}} {{at the time}} of her disappearance. Extensive searches have found no trace of her or the child she might have given birth to. Roldan, who had a criminal record prior to the disappearance, is considered a person of interest in the case. In 2015, he was arrested in North Carolina and charged with the attempted murder of another girlfriend after she survived several gunshot wounds he allegedly inflicted on her during an incident in 2014; he <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> anything about the Decker case. After she recovered, the victim claimed on the Dr. Phil show that he had made statements to her that might implicate him in Decker's disappearance. The incident has also been the subject of a segment of the Investigation Discovery channel series Disappeared. Roldan pled guilty to two lesser charges in 2016; after he serves his sentence he will deported to his native Bolivia.|$|E
25|$|In November 2014 U.S. President Obama {{expanded}} the original role of U.S. Armed Forces in Afghanistan for 2015. Originally {{they were supposed}} to advise, train and assist the Afghan Forces and to hunt the remnants of Al Qaeda. Under the president’s order U.S. forces can carry out missions against the Taliban and other militant groups threatening American troops or the Afghan government while American jets, bombers and drones can support Afghan troops on combat missions. By the end of 2015, half of the 9,800 American troops would leave Afghanistan. The rest would be consolidated in Kabul and Bagram, and then leave by the end of 2016, allowing Obama to say he ended the Afghan war before leaving office. The United States could still have military advisers in Kabul after 2016 who would work out of an office of security cooperation at the United States Embassy. But the Obama administration <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> how large that contingent might be and what its exact mission would be.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Lucy poems" [...] {{have been}} parodied {{numerous}} times since their first publication. These were generally intended to ridicule the simplification of textual complexities and deliberate ambiguities in poetry. They also questioned {{the way many}} 19th-century critics sought to establish definitive readings. According to Jones, such parodies commented in a [...] "meta-critical" [...] manner and themselves present an alternative mode of criticism. Among the more notable is the one by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's son Hartley Coleridge (1796–1849), called [...] "On William Wordsworth" [...] or simply [...] "Imitation", as in the 1827 version published for The Inspector magazine ("He lived amidst th' untrodden ways / To Rydal Lake that lead; / A Bard whom there were none to praise / And very few to read" [...] lines 1–4). Parody also appears in the 1888 murder-mystery reading of the poem by Victorian author Samuel Butler (1835–1902). Butler believed Wordsworth's use of the phrase [...] "the difference to me!" [...] was overly terse, and remarked that the poet was [...] "most careful not to explain {{the nature of the}} difference which the death of Lucy will occasion him to be ... The superficial reader takes it that he is very sorry she was dead... but he <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> this." [...] Not every work referring to the [...] "Lucy poems" [...] is intended to mock, however; the novelist and essayist Mary Shelley (1797–1851) drew upon the poems to comment on and re-imagine the Romantic portrayal of femininity.|$|E
6000|$|I {{feel as if}} I <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> half, {{and they}} have come to ask me if I <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> all! My beloved friend, may you be happy in all ways! ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{think the}} room swam round with her. When it was steady again, [...] "You {{did not say}} that, did you?" [...] she asked. She was sure he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> it. She was smiling again tremulously to show him that he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> it.|$|R

"I <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> it, I <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> it; and if Master Cap {{is ready}} to testify to the fact, {{unlikely}} as it seems, I am willing to try to think it true. I think it every man's duty {{to believe in the}} power of God, however difficult it may be." ...|$|R
2500|$|During {{construction}} of the new stadium, a construction worker and avid Boston Red Sox fan buried a replica jersey of Red Sox player David Ortiz underneath the visitors' dugout {{with the objective of}} placing a [...] "hex" [...] on the Yankees, much like the [...] "Curse of the Bambino" [...] that had allegedly plagued the Red Sox long after trading Ruth to the Yankees. After the worker was exposed by co-workers, he was forced to help exhume the jersey. The Yankees organization then donated the retrieved jersey to the Jimmy Fund, a charity started in 1948 by the Red Sox' National League rivals, the Boston Braves, but long championed by the Red Sox and particularly associated with Ted Williams. The worker has since claimed to have buried a 2004 American League Championship Series program/scorecard, but <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> where he placed it. These attempts didn't have much effect upon the home team, though: the Yankees {{went on to win the}} 2009 World Series at the end of their first MLB season in the new stadium.|$|E
2500|$|In an October 15, 2008 {{interview}} with Us Weekly, Richard gave further insight into O'Day's dismissal from Danity Kane. [...] " [...] {{did not like}} [...] image...where her image was going for the group," [...] she said. [...] "It wasn't a personal thing." [...] Richard explained that O'Day's increasingly [...] "sexy look" [...] was alienating young fans. Referring specifically to O'Day's topless pictures for Complex magazine just a month before, Richard stated, [...] "We had just did a signing with Dollhouse Teen, which is for 13, 14-year-old young girls... So we can't do that one day {{and then the next}} day do an obnoxious cover.... wants the fans, and he says he can't do that if we can continue to go in the direction that we were going." [...] Richard further relayed, [...] " [...] told me specifically that [...] is no longer in Danity Kane and Danity Kane will move forward without her." [...] When asked if Combs would seek [...] "replacements" [...] for O'Day and Woods, Richard stated, [...] "He <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> anything per that. But I think in my heart that he is gonna do another show." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, {{the results}} of these {{gravitational}} wave experiments were largely discredited, although Weber continued to argue that he had detected gravitational waves. [...] In order to test Weber's results, IBM Physicist Richard Garwin built a detector that was similar to Joseph Weber's. In six months, it detected only one pulse, which was most likely noise. David Douglass, another physicist, had discovered an [...] in Weber's computer program that, he claimed, produced the daily gravitational wave signals that Weber claimed to have detected. Because of the error, a signal seemed to appear out of noise. Garwin aggressively confronted Weber with this information at the Fifth Cambridge Conference on Relativity at MIT in June 1974. A series of letters was then exchanged in Physics Today. Garwin asserted that Weber's model was [...] "insane, because the universe would convert all of its energy into gravitational radiation in 50 million years or so, if one were really detecting what Joe Weber was detecting." [...] "Weber," [...] Garwin , [...] "is just such a character that he <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>said,</b> 'No, I never did see a gravity wave.' And the National Science Foundation, unfortunately, which funded that work, is not man enough to clean the record, which they should." [...] In 1972, Heinz Billing and colleagues at Max Planck Institute for Physics built a detector that was similar to Joseph Weber's to verify his claim but found no results.|$|E

60|$|His words seemed {{absurd to}} him, and {{immediately}} {{he wished he}} <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> them. Philip flushed darkly.|$|R
60|$|Phoebe {{coloured}} a little. 'He <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> {{one word}} to Humfrey,' she said.|$|E
60|$|HOPPER. I {{should like}} to have a chat with the Duke, Duchess. He <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> a single word to me yet.|$|E

60|$|This was not {{strictly}} true. Monk <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>said.</b> He <b>had</b> hinted. And he had hinted at flogging, not expulsion.|$|R

6000|$|... "She <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> {{a word to}} me to the contrary. I only fear {{she would}} feel {{that she was being}} sent there,--as to a convent." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{is that as}} I think. She <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> so to me openly; but I {{think it}} is that. Her mother died early,--and her {{brothers}} and her sisters. It is a sad tale, my lord." ...|$|E
