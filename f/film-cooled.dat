40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to measure the aerodynamic performance of a <b>film-cooled</b> turbine stage and to quantify the loss caused by film-cooling. A secondary goal of the research is to provide a detailed breakdown of the losses associated with film-cooling for the turbine stage being tested. The experimental work was carried out at the MIT Blowdown Turbine Facility using a highly loaded turbine stage. The Blowdown Turbine Facility is a short duration test facility capable of testing turbine stages under fully scaled conditions for a test duration of 0. 5 seconds. The facility was modified to enable the measurement of the turbine mass flow and shaft torque. These newly developed measurement techniques, along with previously developed total pressure and temperature instruments, have enabled the measure- ment of the stage isentropic efficiency. A highly loaded turbine stage (without film-cooling) was designed, fabricated, and tested using the newly developed measurement techniques. The turbine stage was then modified to incorporate vane, blade and rotor casing coolant manifolds using precision electrical discharge machining. The film-cooling hole geometry was created using a laser drilling process to produce the required 43, 000 cooling holes. The <b>film-cooled</b> stage was then tested over a range of operating conditions (pressure ratios and corrected speeds) and over a range of coolant-to-mainstream mass flow and temperature ratios. (cont.) The loss due to film-cooling is defined as the difference in performance between the <b>film-cooled</b> turbine and an ideal turbine with the same velocity triangles and airfoil Mach number distributions. However, there is no uncooled turbine geometry that will produce the same flow conditions as the <b>film-cooled</b> turbine stage, and consequently, there is no experimental baseline that can be tested to determine the loss due to film- cooling. A meanline velocity triangle model of the turbine stage was developed using published correlations and loss models to estimate the performance of this ideal stage. The model was calibrated against the baseline test results without coolant and it was then used to estimate the loss due to film-cooling. The estimated loss due to film-cooling was 3. 0 % at the design point, which corresponds to 0. 3 % per percent of coolant. The estimated repeatability (U 95) for the efficiency measurement of the uncooled tur- bine geometry is ± 0. 14 %. Based on this measurement repeatability, the net effect of a design change can be determined with an uncertainty of just ± 0. 1 % if four measurements are repeated for each design configuration. The estimated measurement uncertainty for the <b>film-cooled</b> stage efficiency is 0. 55 % and for back-to-back measurements the uncertainty is 0. 45 %. by Rory Keogh. "February 2001.

40|$|The {{numerical}} procedure of Shembharkar and Pai (1985) for predicting film cooling with a liquid coolant {{was extended to}} take into account significant heat flux through the wall and was used to analyze the film-cooling process with an air-water system.

The method provides a solution for the flow and thermal fields, both in the region where the liquid exists as a subcooled film and in the region where it is completely vaporized. The results indicate that the freestream velocity and temperature have significant effects on the <b>film-cooled</b> length. In the absence of a wall heat flux, the film remains subcooled over distances encountered in practice, whereas {{in the presence of a}} wall heat flux, the procedure predicts the reduction in the <b>film-cooled</b> length due to the increase in interface temperature, concentration, and evaporation rate.

40|$|While {{the effects}} of thermal barrier coating (TBC) thermal {{protection}} and air film cooling effectiveness for jet engine components are usually studied separately, their contributions to combined cooling effectiveness are interdependent and are not simply additive. Therefore, combined cooling effectiveness must be measured to achieve an optimum balance between TBC thermal protection and air film cooling. Phosphor thermometry offers several advantages for mapping temperatures of air film cooled surfaces. While infrared thermography has been typically applied to study air film cooling effectiveness, temperature accuracy depends on knowing surface emissivity (which may change) and correcting for effects of reflected radiation. Because decay time-based full-field phosphor thermometry is relatively immune to these effects, it can be applied advantageously to temperature mapping of air <b>film-cooled</b> TBC-coated surfaces.

40|$|A method {{frequently}} {{used for the}} cooling of highly loaded high-pressure turbine-blades is the so called film-cooling. In this technique air taken from the compressor is blown via slots or rows of holes {{from the inside of}} the blade to build a protective layer along the blade surface. Today, most of the flow solvers used in the design process of <b>film-cooled</b> turbine blades are modelling the coolant ejection by assuming more or less realistic boundary conditions along the exit planes of the coolant channels. In contrast, for a reliable prediction of the behaviour of the coolant jets and therefore for a good prediction of the blade cooling and the formation of losses, it is necessary to extend the calculation domain as far as possible into the coolant channels. Only in this way a realistic simulation of the interactions between coolant and mainstream is possible. As a first step {{in the direction of a}} reliable prediction of the aerodynamic of <b>film-cooled</b> turbine blades several calculation procedures have been developed for the generation of unstructured meshes and for the solution of the two-dimensional Euler- and Navier-Stokes equations using these meshes. The unstructured approach was chosen because of its geometrical flexibility, allowing to mesh arbitrarly formed geometries, and for the easy and efficient way a solution dependent mesh-adaption can be performed. Several test cases with and without coolant ejection have demonstrated the ability of the unstructured approach to cope with a wide range of applications.
