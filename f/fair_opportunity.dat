25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the rule requiring a fair hearing is broad enough to include the rule against bias since a fair hearing must be an unbiased hearing. However, the rules are often treated separately. It is fundamental to fair procedure that both sides should be heard. The right to a fair hearing requires that individuals are not penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the cases against them, a <b>fair</b> <b>opportunity</b> to answer them, and the opportunity to present their own cases.|$|E

40|$|The basic {{assumption}} {{of the idea of}} equal opportunities is based on the assertion that all individuals competing for an advantaged social position should have equal opportunities, i. e., that {{each and every one of}} them should have <b>fair</b> <b>opportunities</b> to achieve a particular goal. Despite the fact that equal opportunities is one of the basic mechanisms for a just distribution of advantageous social positions, the idea of <b>fair</b> equality of <b>opportunity</b> remains divided between different competing political projects, e. g., egalitarian liberalism, libertarian political theory, multiculturalism, etc. This paper examines two basic dimensions of equal opportunities to which existing conceptions fail to offer a unanimous answer, i. e., a) the issue of fairness and b) the issue of the currency of fairness. The concluding part of this paper presents two basic paradoxes that determine both the direction of the discussion as well as the possible solutions to the achievement of <b>fair</b> equal <b>opportunities</b> as part of any process for competing for advantageous social positions...|$|R

25|$|Here, the Court of Appeals, though {{correctly}} {{holding that}} respondent proved a prima facie case, erred in holding that petitioner had not discharged its {{burden of proof}} in rebuttal by showing that its stated reason for the rehiring refusal was based on respondent's illegal activity. But on remand respondent must be afforded a <b>fair</b> <b>opportunity</b> of proving that petitioner's stated reason was just a pretext for a racially discriminatory decision, such as by showing that whites engaging in similar illegal activity were retained or hired by petitioner. Other evidence that may be relevant, depending on the circumstances, could include facts that petitioner had discriminated against respondent {{when he was an}} employee or followed a discriminatory policy toward minority employees.|$|E
25|$|Every {{person has}} the right to have a hearing and be allowed to present his or her own case. Should a person not attend the hearing, even with {{adequate}} notice given, the adjudicator has the discretion to decide if the hearing should proceed. In Ridge v. Baldwin, a chief constable succeeded in having his dismissal from service declared void as he had not been given the opportunity to make a defence. In another case, Chief Constable of the North Wales Police v. Evans (1982), a chief constable required a police probationer to resign on account of allegations about his private life which he was given no <b>fair</b> <b>opportunity</b> to rebut. The House of Lords found the dismissal to be unlawful. Likewise in Surinder Singh Kanda v. Government of the Federation of Malaya (1962), a public servant facing disciplinary proceedings was not supplied with a copy of a prejudicial report by a board of inquiry which the adjudicating officer had access to before the hearing. The Privy Council held that the proceedings had failed to provide him a reasonable opportunity of being heard.|$|E

25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving with a marine division, in action against enemy Japanese forces during extremely hazardous landing operations at Cape Torokina, Bougainville, Solomon Islands, on 1 November 1943. Forced to pass within disastrous range of a strongly protected, well-camouflaged Japanese 75-mm. regimental gun strategically located on the beach, our landing units were suffering heavy losses in casualties and boats while attempting to approach the beach, and the success of the operations was seriously threatened. Observing the ineffectiveness of marine rifle and grenade attacks against the incessant, devastating fire of the enemy weapon and aware of the urgent need for prompt action, Sgt. Owens unhesitatingly determined to charge the gun bunker from the front and, calling on 4 of his comrades to assist him, carefully placed them to cover the fire of the 2 adjacent hostile bunkers. Choosing a moment that provided a <b>fair</b> <b>opportunity</b> for passing these bunkers, he immediately charged into the mouth of the steadily firing cannon and entered the emplacement through the fire port, driving the guncrew out of the rear door and insuring their destruction before he himself was wounded. Indomitable and aggressive in the face of almost certain death, Sgt. Owens silenced a powerful gun which was of inestimable value to the Japanese defense and, by his brilliant initiative and heroic spirit of self-sacrifice, contributed immeasurably to the success of the vital landing operations. His valiant conduct throughout reflects the highest credit upon himself and the U.S. Naval Service.|$|E

Team USA finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first U.S. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding professionals to their line-up. James felt his limited playing time was a [...] "lowlight" [...] and believed he was not given [...] "a <b>fair</b> <b>opportunity</b> to play".

500|$|One of the {{submissions}} {{raised by}} the appellants was that the prohibition and deregistration orders were made in breach of the natural justice principle of audi alteram partem, or [...] "hear the other side". This {{is regarded as a}} cardinal principle of natural justice, requiring that no person shall be condemned unless he or she has been given prior notice of the allegations against him or her and a <b>fair</b> <b>opportunity</b> to be heard. In general, Article 12(1) of the Constitution protects rights such as this. Audi alteram partem has been referred to by the Court of Appeal as one of the two rules that make up the administrative law rules of natural justice, the other being nemo iudex in causa sua ("no man a judge in his own cause").|$|E

Subsequently, he argued that he should have been warned of the legal implications of not being legally represented. The High Court rejected this argument and held he had suffered no prejudice. Dr. Ho had been given a <b>fair</b> <b>opportunity</b> of presenting his own case and, most importantly, had not been deprived of his right to cross-examine the witnesses.|$|E

Shortly after Franklin Roosevelt's 1936 re-election, Hickok was hired by Whalen to do publicity for the 1939 New York World's <b>Fair.</b> <b>Opportunities</b> for female employees of the Fair were limited, and she found the work unrewarding compared to her reporting days. Hickok primarily worked on promoting the fair to young people, including arranging class trips.

2500|$|Health {{disparity}} {{has been}} defined by the World Health Organization as the differences in health care received by different groups {{of people that are}} not only unnecessary and avoidable but also unfair and unjust.

Equity in health refers to the situation whereby every individual has a <b>fair</b> <b>opportunity</b> to attain their full health potential, and that no one should be denied from achieving this potential.

Monty Neill, the {{director}} of the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, claims that students who speak English as a language, who have a disability, or who come from low-income families are disproportionately denied a diploma due to a test score, which is unfair and harmful. In the late 1970s when the graduation test began in the United States, for example, a lawsuit delayed that many Black students had not had a <b>fair</b> <b>opportunity</b> on the material they were tested on the graduation test because they had attended schools segregated by law. “The interaction of under-resourced schools and testing most powerfully hits students of color”, as Neill argues, “They are disproportionately denied diplomas or grade promotion, and the schools they attend are the ones most likely to fare poorly on the tests and face sanctions such as restructuring.” ...|$|E

[...] Courts must also ensure that the petitioner is not significantly prejudiced by the delayed focus on the limitation issue, and [...] "determine whether the interests of justice would be better served" [...] by addressing the merits or by dismissing the petition as time barred. [...] The Court also stated that a district court would not have the discretion to disregard the choice of a defendant to intelligently waive the limitations defense. [...] In this case, however, the Court believed the Magistrate Judge gave Day due notice and a <b>fair</b> <b>opportunity</b> to show why the limitation period should not yield dismissal of the petition, and there was nothing to suggest that the State [...] "strategically" [...] withheld the defense or chose to relinquish it. [...] The record instead indicated that the miscalculation was [...] "merely an inadvertent error." ...|$|E
40|$|In this essay, Johannes Giesinger {{comments}} on the current philosophical debate on educational justice. He observes that while authors like Elizabeth Anderson and Debra Satz develop a so-called adequacy view of educational justice, Harry Brighouse and Adam Swift defend an egalitarian principle. Giesinger focuses his analysis on the main objection that is formulated, from an egalitarian perspective, against the adequacy view: that it neglects the problem of securing <b>fair</b> <b>opportunities</b> in the competition for social rewards. Giesinger meets this objection by expressing two basic theses: First, he argues that Brighouse and Swift themselves fail to give an adequate account of fair competition; and, second, he shows that the adequacy view provides the theoretical resources to face this problem...|$|R
