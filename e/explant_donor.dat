40|$|The somatic {{embryogenesis}} response is close {{linked with the}} development phase of the <b>explant</b> <b>donor</b> plant. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} work was to determine the effect of male flower position in the plant on the embryogenic responses in plantain cv. `FHIA- 21 ' (Musa AAAB). In this study male flower were collected at 0, 10, 20 and 30 cm from the last female flower. After 20 weeks on culture, the number of callus with somatic structures was evaluated. Thereafter, the effect of the callus morphology in the establishment of embryogenic cell suspensions was assessed. The results showed that the development phase of immature male flower (measured by the distance to the last female flower) was an important factor on the embryogenic callus induction. The best response on embryogenic callus formation (8. 77 %) was obtained with explants collected just after the last female flower (0 cm). Although, it was possible to assess that 85. 0 % of the callus composed by pro-embryogenic masses and somatic embryos in the early stage of its ontogeny development, resulted in embryogenic cell suspensions with the major volume of settled cell aggregated. As a result, it was possible to conclude that the age of the male flower play an important role on the somatic embryogenic process in plantain cv. `FHIA- 21 '.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} our work was to improve the {{regeneration}} capacity of leaf explants {{and the maintenance of}} shoot morphogenesis in callus of six pear cultivars: Abate Fetel, Conference, Dar Gazi, Harrow Sweet, Kaiser and Williams, by altering the composition of both regeneration and proliferation media of <b>explant</b> <b>donor</b> shoots, and choosing the right type of explant. Regeneration capacity of leaf explants collected from in vitro shoots has been improved in the majority of cultivars also due to shoot preconditioning. For the first time, long term morphogenic callus production and maintenance have been established in some cultivars by a “double regeneration”. Using this technique, morphogenic callus of two cultivars, ‘Dar Gazi’ and ‘Conference’, was maintained for several subcultures but only when they were initiated from small leaflets – less than 2 – 3  mm long – which had been collected from the neoformed adventitious buds. MS medium [Murashige, T., Skoog, F., 1962. A revised medium for rapid growth and bioassay with tobacco tissue culture. Physiol. Plant. 15, 473 – 497] proved to be an efficient regeneration medium by stimulating adventitious buds, while the explants of all cultivars, except for Kaiser, showed a high regeneration capacity when they were collected from shoots proliferated on modified QL medium [Quoirin, M, Lepoivre, P., Boxus, P., 1977. Un premier bilan de dix annees de recherche sur les cultures de meristemes et la multiplication in vitro de fruitiers ligneux. Compte rendu des recherches, Station des Cultures Fruitieres et Maraicheres de Gembloux (1976 – 1977), 93 – 117]. This medium conferred leaf expansion, overcoming 90 % of regeneration in explants of cv Dar Gazi and Williams. Well expanded leaves were obtained and collected by rooting the shoots, while regeneration percentage was not improved and the number of adventitious shoots was increased in most cultivars, reaching up to 10 shoots per explant. When cefotaxime at 200  mg/l, which is normally effective in controlling Agrobacterium, was used for genetic transformation, regeneration percentage and number of shoots per explant (in leaf explants collected from rooted shoots) were increased and a uniform bud regeneration on all the leaf surface was promoted.

Nine labium majus strains from adult females {{had a mean}} Bmax value three times {{greater than that of}} seven nongenital strains from adult females (33 vs. 11 fmol/mg cell protein). The Bmax results for 13 adult nongenital strains varied from 5. 6 to 23. 3 fmol/mg protein; the values for males and females had very similar means and ranges. The variation could not be correlated with the chronologic age of adult skin <b>explant</b> <b>donors</b> or with the in vitro age (mean population doubling level) of the cultures assayed. The Bmax activities of three nongenital strains from normal infants (two male, one female) did not exceed 5 fmol/mg protein. Seven of eight nongenital TF strains had Bmax values below 2 fmol/mg protein; the value for the eighth coincided with the lower limit of normal adults. The lower limit of DHT binding in normal labium majus strains was 15 fmol/mg protein. Three of five labial strains from patients with TF had Bmax values close to zero; the other two fell between 10 and 15 fmol/mg protein. It is apparant that labial skin fibroblast strains from clinically homogeneous patients with TF had highly variable degrees of DHT binding deficiency, and that they permit a more reliable diagnosis of severe and intermediate degrees of DHT binding deficiency than do strains of nongenital skin fibroblasts...|$|R

For immature seeds, gibberellic acid (GA 3) was or was not tested at a concentration of 1. 5 mg l - 1. From the seedlings obtained, the cotyledon and apical segments were removed and cultured in complete MS medium with five combinations of 6 -benzylaminopurine (BAP) and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) : 0. 0; 0. 25; 0. 5; 1. 0; 2. 0 and 0. 0; 0025; 0. 05; 0. 1; 0. 2 mg L- 1, respectively.

The objectives of this study were: to identify the donor plant mycobiota and to identify filamentous fungi contaminants at the establishment phase of mahogany, teak, majagua, pine and cedar. <b>Explants</b> of <b>donor</b> plants were placed in moist chamber and were prepared to direct optical microscope of fungal growth. Cultural characteristics and morphological were taken into account to identify filamentous fungi contaminants in the establishment phase. Frequency of all genera identified was determined. Eleven genera of filamentous fungi in donor plants and twenty genera {{in the establishment of}} forest species were identified. The genera Botryodiplodia, Cephalosporium, Diplodia, Dreschlera, Geotrichum, Gloeosporium Helminthosporium, Memnoniella, Oidiodendron and Rhinoclediella appeared only during establishment phase. Others such as Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cercospora, Curvularia, Cladosporium, Colletotricum, Fusarium, Nigrospora, Penicillium and Pestalotia were detected in donor plants and during establishment phase. This indicates that the possible source of contamination was the initial explant.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if AM stroma suppresses the expression of the IL- 1 gene family in cultured human corneal limbal epithelial cells.  METHODS—Human corneal limbal epithelial cells were cultured from limbocorneal <b>explants</b> of <b>donor</b> eyes on plastic or on the AM stroma. Transcript expression of IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β, IL- 1 receptor antagonist (RA), and GAPDH was compared with or without addition of lipopolysaccharide to their serum-free media for 24  hours using RNAse protection assay (RPA). Their protein production in the supernatant was analysed by ELISA.  RESULTS—Expression of IL- 1 α and IL- 1 β transcripts and proteins was significantly reduced by cells cultured on the AM stromal matrix compared with plastic cultures whether lipopolysaccharide was added or not. Moreover, expression of IL- 1 RA by cells cultured in the lipopolysaccharide-free medium was upregulated by AM stromal matrix. The ratio between IL- 1 RA and IL- 1 α protein levels in AM cultures was higher than in plastic cultures.  CONCLUSIONS—AM stromal matrix markedly suppresses lipopolysaccharide induced upregulation of both IL- 1 α and IL- 1 β. These data may explain in part the effect of AM transplantation in reducing ocular surface inflammation, underscoring the unique feature of the AM as a substrate for tissue engineering. ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe {{synthetic}} progestogens, {{medroxyprogesterone acetate}} (MPA) and norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN),are {{widely used in}} developing countries as injectable contraceptives, where disease burden is high. Levonorgestrel (LNG) is a common progestogen used in oral contraceptives and intrauterine devices. Some studies suggest that MPA, unlike NET, increases HIV- 1 acquisition in women, while few studies have reported {{on the effects of}} LNG on HIV- 1 acquisition. Whether MPA, NET and LNG differentially affect HIV- 1 infection and the expression of key genes relevant to HIV- 1 acquisition via differential molecular mechanisms is key to understanding choice of progestogen contraceptive in young women at high risk forHIV- 1 acquisition. The central hypothesis {{of this study is that}} the differential effects on host gene expression and HIV- 1 replication by the different progestogens is due to their differential selectivity to towards different steroid receptors, in particular the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In order to investigate this hypothesis, the regulation of selected genes was investigated in cervical tissue explants from premenopausal, HIV- 1 negative, and contraception negative women and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from women, by real time quantitative PCR, western blotting and Luminex assays, in response to physiologically relevant doses of progestogens. Infection assays were performed in the absence and presence of HIV- 1 using HIV- 1 BAL-RENILLA or HIVpNL 4. 3 infectious molecular clones (IMCs). The GR antagonist RU 486 or GR siRNA knockdown was used to determine the role of the GR in modulating ligand-specific effects. PBMCs and primary cervical explants were chosen as useful models to assess the direct effects of these progestogens in both the systemic and in the local mucosal immune environments. In PBMCs, MPA like dexamethasone (DEX, a GR specific agonist), showed anti-inflammatory effects, decreasing pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL) 6, IL 8 and regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted(RANTES) levels and increasing anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid interacting leucine zipper (GILZ) gene expression levels, while NET, progesterone (P 4) and LNG did not, after 48 hours. In primary ectocervical tissue explants, DEX, cortisol, MPA and P 4 significantly repressed IL 6 while only DEX, cortisol and MPA significantly repressed IL 8 and increased GILZ gene expression levels after 48 hours. Steroid receptor expression was characterised in both PBMCs and ectocervical explants. GR was the only detectable steroid receptor protein expressed in PBMCs, while ectocervical explants expressed all the steroid receptors. The progesterone and estrogen receptor levels were higher in ectocervical <b>explants</b> from <b>donors</b> that were in the follicular phase compared to ectocervical <b>explants</b> from <b>donors</b> in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. In PBMCs, results suggested that differential gene expression by MPA versus NET and P 4 is mediated via the GR after 48 hours. Furthermore, it was observed that MPA and DEX, unlike NET, LNG and P 4 increases HIV- 1 replication in viable PBMCs, in the majority of donors. The increase in HIV- 1 replication in the MPA treated PBMC samples correlated significantly with an increased in IL 6 mRNA levels...|$|R

This article reports identification of key proteomic changes in a bystander reporter cell line (HaCaT) grown in low-dose irradiated tissue-conditioned media (ITCM) from rainbow trout fish. In vitro explant cultures were generated from the skin of fish previously exposed to low doses (0. 1 and 0. 5 Gy) of X-ray radiation in vivo. The ITCM was harvested from all <b>donor</b> <b>explant</b> cultures and placed on recipient HaCaT cells to observe any change in protein expression caused by the bystander signals. Proteomic methods using 2 -dimensional (2 D) gel electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy were employed to screen for novel proteins expressed.

By expression microarray, we previously found the GATA 3 transcription factor significantly downregulated in lesional psoriatic skin. Since GATA 3 serves as a key switch in both epidermal and T helper cell differentiation, we investigated its function in psoriasis. Because psoriatic skin inflammation shares many characteristics of epidermal regeneration during wound healing, we also studied GATA 3 expression under such conditions. Psoriatic lesional skin showed decreased GATA 3 mRNA and protein expression compared to non-lesional skin. GATA 3 expression was also markedly decreased in inflamed skin of mice with a psoriasiform dermatitis induced with imiquimod. Tape-stripping of nonlesional skin of patients with psoriasis, a standardized psoriasis-triggering and skin regeneration-inducing technique, reduced the expression of GATA 3. In wounded skin of mice, low GATA 3 mRNA and protein expression was detected. Taken together, GATA 3 expression is downregulated under regenerative and inflammatory hyperproliferative skin conditions. GATA 3 expression could be re-induced by successful narrow-band UVB treatment of both human psoriasis and imiquimodinduced psoriasiform dermatitis in mice.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveStatins possess {{anti-inflammatory}} properties. This {{study was}} undertaken {{to characterize the}} mechanism of action of statin drugs on collagenase expression in primary human osteoarthritic cartilage tissue. MethodHuman articular chondrocytes and cartilage <b>explants</b> from osteoarthritic <b>donors</b> were exposed to simvastatin in {{the presence or absence}} of interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β). Collagenase expression was determined by quantifying levels of matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP- 13) and MMP- 1 mRNA and MMP- 13 protein. The mechanism of statin action was tested by addition of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) or by using inhibitors of farnesyl transferase (FT) and geranylgeranyl transferase (GGT- 1). ResultsTreatment of osteoarthritic chondrocytes with simvastatin decreased mRNA levels of MMP- 13 and MMP- 1 whether under basal conditions or during stimulation with IL- 1 β. MMP- 13 protein secreted into the culture media was also decreased. Genes involved in cartilage synthesis (type II collagen and aggrecan) were not down-regulated by simvastatin. Exogenous addition of GGPP completely reversed the statin-mediated decrease in MMP- 13 mRNA and protein levels whereas FPP partially reversed the statin-mediated effect. An inhibitor of GGT- 1 mimicked the simvastatin-mediated reduction in MMP- 13 expression by chondrocytes. Finally, consistent with impacts on MMP- 13 and MMP- 1 expression, simvastatin as well as the GGT- 1 inhibitor both blocked type II collagen degradation in primary human articular cartilage explants. ConclusionThese results suggest that statins modulate chondrocyte metabolism by reducing prenylation of key signaling molecules that control the expression of collagen-degrading enzymes. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that protein prenyltransferases including geranylgeranyl transferase regulate chondrocyte collagenase expression in osteoarthritis...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether cultured fetal human {{retinal pigment epithelium}} (RPE) cells can attach and differenti-ate on submacular Bruch’s membrane from donors over age 55. Methods: Differential debridements of Bruch’s membrane were performed to expose three different surfaces: the RPE basement membrane, the superficial inner collagenous layer (ICL) directly below the RPE basement membrane, and the deeper ICL. Approximately 3, 146 cells/mm 2 were seeded onto these Bruch’s membrane explants and cultured for 1 or 7 days. Explants were bisected and examined histologically or analyzed with scanning electron microscopy. Nuclear density counts were performed on stained sections. Morphology and cell density were compared to those of cells seeded onto bovine corneal endothelial cell–extracellular matrix (BCE-ECM). Results: Compared to cells seeded onto BCE-ECM at similar density, cell coverage and cellular morphology were poor at both time points. Unlike cells on BCE-ECM, cell density remained the same or decreased with time. In general, cell morphology on all surfaces worsened by day 7 compared to day 1. Although cells were more pigmented on RPE base-ment membrane and deep ICL at day 7, poor cellular morphology indicated the remaining cells were not well differen-tiated. An <b>explant</b> from a <b>donor</b> with large soft drusen showed the poorest resurfacing at day 7 in organ culture. Conclusions: These data indicate that aged submacular human Bruch’s membrane does not support transplanted RPE survival and differentiation. The formation of localized RPE defects, cell death, and worsening cellular morphology on aged Bruch’s membrane suggest that modification of Bruch’s membrane may be necessary in patients with age-related macular degeneration receiving RPE transplants to prevent graft failure.

The samples were inoculated immediately in culture medium and incubated for at least 10 days. From 1124 explanted samples 430 were contaminated: 99 with pathological bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, Escherichia coli etc., 331 with nosocomial bacteria such as coagulase neg. Staphylococcus, Corynebacteria, etc. The samples that were contaminated with pathological bacteria were excluded from the study. The other contaminated group was re-processed and re-tested for contamination. The factors influencing the results of contamination were anatomical location of the explants and the experience of the surgical team. In contrast, the donor type (heart beating vs. heart not beating) did not play any role. From 1999 to 2003 the University Hospital of Careggi in Florence, Italy, used 721 explants from which 624 were retrieved from the Regional Tuscan Tissue and Cell Bank, 72 from foreign banks and 14 from another national bank. The explants from foreign banks were all re-tested according to our standards. Among those, 699 samples were sterile and 22 samples (3...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to develop a transformation and regeneration system for rice (Oryza sativa L.) using haploid cells as the materials in an attempt to obtain homozygous transgenic plants quickly. The study was divided into two parts, (1) attempt to establish an effective procedure for regeneration of fertile (double-haploid) rice plants from haploid cells, i. e. protoplasts, and to evaluate the phenotypic features of the regenerated Ro plants and their R 1 progenies; (2) to genetically transform rice haploid cells and obtain fertile (double-haploid) transgenic plants, and to confirm homozygosity of the transgenes in the progeny. ^ A regeneration system has been established for isolating haploid protoplasts of both japonica and indica rice varieties. Conditions have been modified and optimized for selection of <b>donor</b> <b>explants</b> (immature panicles), induction of anther-derived calli, initiation of haploid embryogenic suspension cultures, culture of isolated protoplasts, and regeneration of fertile rice plants. The regenerated Ro plants generally had a short stature and low seed fertility; however, their selfed R 1 progenies had comparable phenotypic traits with the seed-grown plants. High phenotypic uniformity in the R 1 progenies indicated the Ro plants were doubled-haploid plants. ^ Fertile indica and japonica transgenic plants have been produced via either PEG-mediated transformation of protoplasts or microprojectile bombardment of haploid suspension cell clusters. Conditions and physical parameters involved in both transformation systems were optimized. Haploid protoplasts were found to be very sensitive to the PEG treatment and resulted in a relatively low efficiency of callus recovery. The plant regeneration frequency of PEG-treated protoplasts was about 0. 3 to 4. 0 per million protoplasts plated. ^ Haploid suspension cells were also effective for obtaining fertile transgenic rice plants following gene delivery by particle bombardment. Multiple gene integrations and rearrangements in T o plants were obtained by this method, and the frequency of co-transformation of two separate genes was about 60...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar a eficácia e aspecto estrutural de células límbicas epiteliais humanas cultivadas sobre membrana amniótica (MA) com e sem epitélio. MÉTODOS: As culturas límbicas foram obtidas a partir de rima corneoescleral remanescentes de transplantes de córnea de 6 diferentes doadores. Cada explante foi cultivado em três diferentes grupos: MA desepitelizada por tripsina (Grupo 1), MA com epitélio íntegro (Grupo 2) e controle (Grupo 3). A migração epitelial foi avaliada por microscopia de contraste de fase. Após 15 dias, as células cultivadas sobre MA foram submetidas à microscopia eletrônica para avaliar migração e adesão epitelial. RESULTADOS: Todas as células do grupo controle cresceram até atingir confluência. Somente uma das culturas em membrana amniótica desepitelizada não apresentou crescimento epitelial. O crescimento de células epiteliais sobre membrana amniótica epitelizada foi observada em apenas uma cultura. CONCLUSÃO: Baseando-se nestes achados, o uso de membrana amniótica desepitelizada aparenta ser o melhor substrato para migração e adesão epitelial comparando com membrana amniótica epitelizada. Remover o epitélio da membrana amniótica demonstra ser um importante passo para estabelecer culturas de células sobre membrana amniótica. PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy and ultrastructural {{aspects of human}} limbal epithelial cells cultured on amniotic membrane (AM) with and without epithelium. METHODS: Limbal epithelial cell cultures were established from cadaveric cor neo-scleral rim explants derived from 6 different <b>donors.</b> The <b>explants</b> from each <b>donor</b> were placed under 3 different groups: on human preserved AM with epithelium (Group 1), AM deepithelialized with trypsin (Group 2) and control (Group 3). The epithelial cell migration was evaluated under phase contrast microscopy. After 15 days, the amniotic membrane with cells cultures were removed and submitted to scanning and transmission electron microscopy to check for epithelial migration and adhesion. RESULTS: All epithelial cell cultures from the controls grew over the botton of the culture plate wells until reaching confluence. Epithelial cultures grew over all but one denuded amniotic membrane. In the group amniotic membrane with epithelium, epithelial cell growing was observed only in 1 well. CONCLUSIONS: Using this model, denuded amniotic membrane {{appeared to be the}} best substrate for epithelial cell migration and adhesion comparing to amniotic membrane with epithelium. Removal of amniotic membrane epithelial seems to be an important step for establishing limbal epithelial cell culture on amniotic membrane...|$|R
40|$|Toll-like (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are {{families}} of transmembrane or intracellular pattern recognition receptors that play parts in innate immunity. They mainly recognize the nonself molecular patterns outside or inside host cells triggering defense mechanisms and cellular changes. At the periodontal front, pathogen related molecular patterns (PAMP) e. g. lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipopeptides or glycolipids were recognized by corresponding receptors of the lining cells. Microbial anaerobic PAMP accumulation would {{eventually lead to}} local chronic inflammation under low redox environment in the periodontitis loci. Through recognition of these patterns, the lining cells receptors activate intracellular signaling for instance via the NF-κB pathway to trigger various cell reactions. The aim of this project is to characterize the role of periodontal resident cells PAMP recognition, in particular {{under the influence of}} low oxygen levels. This project hypothesized that hypoxia in combination with LPS may influence and modulate the expressions of TLRs and NLRs in periodontal resident cells, which might be related to intracellular signaling involving nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). Human gingival biopsies were collected from periodontitis or healthy sites from donors without systemic diseases. Immunohistochemistry were carried out to detect TLRs and selected NLRs (NOD 1 / 2 and NLRP 1 / 2) peptides expression. Biopsies of healthy gingivae were collected to cultivate human gingival resident cells, i. e. human gingival keratinocytes (HGKs) and human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs). TLRs, NLRs and NF-κBs transcripts and peptides expressions on HGK/HGF were screened under hypoxia (1 % O 2), normoxia (18 % O 2) with/without treatment of 2 μg/ml Escherichia coli LPS over various time periods. Cellular levels of ROS and ATP were also followed. We attempted immortalization of keratinocyte <b>explants</b> from healthy <b>donors.</b> TLR 1 / 2 / 4 / 5 / 6, NOD 1 / 2 and NLRP 1 / 2 peptides were detected in both healthy and periodontitis biopsies. TLR 2 / 4 and NOD 1 / 2 immunostaining appeared stronger in pocket compared to junctional epithelium, while TLR 1 / 2 / 5 and NOD 1 immunostaining seemed stronger in periodontitis than healthy oral epithelium. In the periodontitis sub-epithelial connective tissue, immunostaining of TLR 1 / 2 / 4 / 5 / 6, NOD 1 / 2 and NLRP 1 / 2 were enhanced. Transcripts of TLR 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 / 8 / 10, NOD 1 / 2 and NLRP 1 / 2 were detected in periodontitis tissue. In HGK and HGF explants, transcripts of TLR 1 - 6, NOD 1 / 2 and NLRP 1 / 2 were detected. Hypoxia and/or E. coli LPS induced HGK/HGF-TLR 1 / 2 / 6 and NOD 2 signals and/or peptides accumulation. Regarding intracellular signals followed, hypoxia and/or LPS induced NF-κB 2 and/or RelB signal and peptide accumulation in HGK and HGF, while no significant influence was observed for other NF-κBs. The increased expression of RelB and NF-κB 2 suggested that the noncanonical NF-κB pathway may be involved in the corresponding cellular responses towards hypoxia and LPS. Our preliminary data showed one immortalized HGK line was successfully maintained till passages 33 with normal cellular contours, suggesting the attempt was successful. In conclusions, with the limitation of this project, TLR 2 and NOD 2 in HGKs and HGFs appeared reacting to hypoxia and LPS, during which NF-κB 2 and RelB may contribute in the subsequent intracellular signaling. Further studies, are required to characterize and confirm the biology of hypoxia and E. coli LPS mediated periodontal residential cells pattern recognition in human periodontitis. published_or_final_versionDentistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Next, the {{influences}} on the migration of neural crest cell from the microenvironment of the hindgut through which the neural crest cells migrate were studied. An organ culture system was established to recombine different gut segments together at E 11. 5 for gut culture in order to trace the migration of neural crest cells from the midgut of the +/+ or Dom/+ embryo to the hindgut of the same or different genotypes. At E 11. 5, the midgut of both +/+ and Dom/+ embryos had already been fully colonized by neural crest cells, thus an <b>explanted</b> midgut segment (<b>donor</b> midgut) could serve {{as the source of}} the neural crest cells, while the caudal half of the hindgut (recipient hindgut) acted as the recipient of the neural crest cells from the donor midgut segment because at this stage, the caudal half of the hindgut was completely devoid of neural crest cells. After three days of culture, when a segment of midgut from the +/+ embryo was used as the donor of migratory vagal neural crest-derived cells and combined with an aneural segment of the hindgut (segment without neural crest-derived cells) from Dom/+ or Dom/Dom embryos, neural crest-derived cells from the midgut segment successfully crossed the combination junction and migrated normally along the hindgut segment to reach its caudal end within a normal developmental time frame. However, the migration of neural crest-derived donor cells from the Dom/+ midgut segment was abnormal in the recipient hindgut with a genotype of +/+, Dom/+ or Dom/Dom as evidenced by the retarded rostrocaudal progression of the vagal neural crest-derived cells and the reduced number of migratory cells in the recipient hindgut segment. These results thus indicate that the migration of the vagal neural crest-derived cells is minimally influenced by the migratory environment of the hindgut of the Dom embryo, and that the neural crest cells themselves may be defective in migration leading to the retarded migration in the hindgut of Dom mouse embryos. The vagal neural crest cells originating from the region of the neural tube adjacent to somites 1 to 7 migrate along defined pathways to the gastrointestinal tract and then colonize the gut to give rise to the majority of neurons and glia of the enteric nervous system. Mutation of Sox 10 in the Dominant megacolon (Dom) mouse, which is an animal model of Hirschsprung's disease, leads to aganglionosis (absence of ganglia) in varying lengths of the hindgut. To investigate the underlying cellular mechanism of aganglionosis, the migration of vagal neural crest cells from the neural tube to the gut (pre-enteric migration) in Dom mouse embryos at E 8. 5 was firstly traced with extrinsic cell markers, such as wheat germ agglutinin gold conjugates (WGA-Au) or fluorescent dye DiI. After the vagal neural crest cells entered the gut at E 9. 5, their migration was then followed by the examination of the expression of specific markers for undifferentiated neural crest cells with immunohistochemical staining. It was found that, although vagal neural crest cells in embryos of the three genotypes examined migrated along similar pre-enteric pathways at a similar migratory rate, the numbers of neural crest cells in embryos heterozygous (Dom/+) and homozygous (Dom/Dom) for the Sox 10 mutation were significantly reduced when compared with the number of neural crest cells in wild-type (+/+) embryos. After vagal neural crest had entered the gut and from E 10. 5 onwards, no neural crest-derived cells were found in the gut of Dom/Dom embryos, and the migration of neural crest cells along the Dom/+ gut was significantly retarded from E 12. 5 onwards as compared with the migration in stage-matched +/+ embryos. To further trace the cause of defective migration of neural crest cells in the Dom embryo, the proliferation and survival of neural crest cells were investigated with BrdU labeling and TUNEL assay. It was found that, although there was no obvious difference in the proliferating ability of vagal neural crest cells in embryos of all the three Dom genotypes studied during the pre-enteric migration and the migration in the gut, more apoptotic neural crest cells were found along the pre-enteric migratory pathway of Dom/Dom embryos than Dom/+ and +/+ embryos. Therefore, the decreased surviving ability, but possibly not the reduced proliferating ability, of neural crest cells during their pre-enteric migration may be partly responsible for aganglionosis in the hindgut of the Dom mouse.
