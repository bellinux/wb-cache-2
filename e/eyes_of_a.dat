5|$|A normal dog has {{a muscular}} {{appearance}} {{with a deep}} chest and strong legs. The French Spaniel has <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dark amber colour, and a thick tail that tapers towards the tip. The hair is medium, dense, with long feathers on the ears, backs of the legs and tail. It has some waviness on the chest and otherwise lies flat on the body. The normal colour of a French Spaniel's coat is white with brown markings rather in shade from a light cinnamon to dark liver. Historically, the coat was only white with black markings, but the breed was mixed with other colours of Spaniels during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} famous anti-Tom books are The Sword and the Distaff by William Gilmore Simms, Aunt Phillis's Cabin by Mary Henderson Eastman, and The Planter's Northern Bride by Caroline Lee Hentz, with the last author having been a close {{personal}} friend of Stowe's when the two lived in Cincinnati. Simms' book was published {{a few months after}} Stowe's novel, and it contains a number of sections and discussions disputing Stowe's book and her view of slavery. Hentz's 1854 novel, widely read at the time but now largely forgotten, offers a defense of slavery as seen through the <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> northern woman—the daughter of an abolitionist, no less—who marries a southern slave owner.|$|E

5|$|Generally the {{jumping spider}} {{subfamily}} Spartaeinae, {{which includes the}} genus Portia, cannot discriminate objects at such long distances as the members of subfamilies Salticinae or Lyssomaninae can. However, members of Portia have vision about as acute as {{the best of the}} jumping spiders, for example: the salticine Mogrus neglectus can distinguish prey and conspecifics up to 320millimetres away (42times its own body length), while P. fimbriata can distinguish these up to 280millimetres (47times its own body length). The main <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Portia can also identify features of the scenery up to 85times its own body length, which helps the spider to find detours.|$|E

5|$|The frog cake {{is a small}} dessert {{shaped to}} {{resemble}} a frog with its mouth open, consisting of a sponge base with a jam centre, topped in artificial cream {{and covered with a}} thick layer of fondant icing. The recipe today remains identical to the one employed when the cake was first produced in the 1920s. When manufactured, large layers of sponge cake are combined and cut mechanically into shape, covered in the fondant, and the mouth is then formed with a hot knife. Fondant <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> contrasting colour are manually added to the head, and the completed dessert is presented in a paper patty-pan. The fondant is normally brown, green or pink, but for special occasions colours can include variations such as red and yellow.|$|E

5|$|The {{porpoise}} eye {{is relatively}} small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> porpoise are placed {{on the sides of}} its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When porpoises surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; their eyes contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Porpoises do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most porpoises have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, they are able to form a very clear image of the surrounding area.|$|E
