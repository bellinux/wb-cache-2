However, mutations of iodotyrosine deiodinase are often not detected until after developmental damage has already occurred. Furthermore, these mutations may not be specifically detected using standard thyroid function tests.

As structural disordered disposition in the protein may induce the side-effect and reduce the occupancy for ligand to bind with target protein, PONDR-Fit protocol was performed to predict the disordered disposition in TRAF 6 protein before virtual screening. TCM compounds from the TCM Database@Taiwan were employed for virtual screening to identify potent compounds as lead compounds of TRAF 6 inhibitor.

Substrate coordination to IYD induces formation of an additional helix and coil that act as an active site lid to shield the resulting substrate·flavin complex from solvent. This complex is stabilized by aromatic stacking and extensive hydrogen bonding between the substrate and flavin.

The fractions were analyzed by electrospray and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry in combination with Edman degradation. The post-translational modifications of all seven tyrosyl residues of the fragment were characterized at an unprecedented level of definition. The analysis revealed the formation of: 1) monoiodotyrosine from tyrosine 1234; 2) monoiodotyrosine, <b>diiodotyrosine,</b> triiodothyronine (T- 3), and tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine, T- 4) from tyrosine 1291; and 3) monoiodotyrosine, <b>diiodotyrosine,</b> and dehydroalanine from tyrosine 1375. Iodothyronine formation from tyrosine 1291 accounted for 10 % of total T- 4 of thyroglobulin (0. 30 mol of T- 4 /mol of 660 -kDa thyroglobulin), and 8 % of total T- 3 (0. 08 mol of T- 3 /mol of thyroglobulin). This is the first documentation of the hormonogenic nature of tyrosine 1291 of bovine thyroglobulin, as thyroxine formation at a corresponding site was so far reported only in rabbit, guinea pig, and turtle thyroglobulin.

The number of the immunological reaction ring due to chemoimmunological specificity proves to be single. 4) The guinea pigs sensitized by iodated human-serum albumin demonstrate anaphylaxis by intravenous injection of iodated egg-albumin, and guinea pigs sensitized by phenylureido egg-albumin develop Arthus reaction by intracutaneous injection of phenylureido human-serum albumin. 5) When guinea pigs are sensitized subcutaneously with phenylisocyanate, they develop Arthus reaction by phenylisocyanate. Therefore, this is a substance that possesses sensibilization. On the other hand, in the case where Arthus reaction is made to take place by phenylureido human-serum albumin in the guinea pig previously sensitized by phenylureido egg-albumin, when the mixture of phenylureido human-serum albumin and phenylureido-lysine is injected, the reaction is weakened. Namely, there can be observed an inhibitory reaction by monovalent antigen. 6) From these results, it is assumed that allergic skin inflammation and anaphylaxis in the animals sensitized by iodine and phenylisocyanate is due to the antigen-antibody reaction of the determinant groups as <b>diiodotyrosine</b> and phenylureido-lysine respectively...|$|E

40|$|Iodotyrosine {{deiodinase}} (IYD) {{has remained}} poorly characterized for nearly 50 years {{in spite of}} its function as an iodine salvage pathway and its role in regulation of mammalian basal metabolism. IYD catalyzes the reductive deiodination of both mono- and <b>diiodotyrosine,</b> the iodinated side-products of thyroid hormone production. The Rokita lab previously purified IYD from porcine thyroids and identified a putative dehalogenase cDNA. The work in this dissertation confirms the identity of the cDNA that encodes IYD through expression in HEK 293 cells (KM = 4. 4 ± 1. 7 &# 956;M and Vmax = 12 ± 1 nmol hr- 1 &# 61549;g- 1) and, furthermore, identifies IYD as the first mammalian member of the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase superfamily, a protein fold previously found only in bacteria. In addition, a three-dimensional model of the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase domain of IYD was constructed based on the x-ray crystal structure coordinates (Protein Data Bank code 1 ICR) of the minor nitroreductase from Escherichia coli. The model also predicts structural features of IYD, including interactions between the flavin bound to IYD and one of three conserved cysteines. To investigate the role of the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase domain plays in electron transfer, two truncation mutants were generated: IYD-NR (residues 81 - 285) and IYD-&# 916;TM (residues 34 - 285) encoding transmembrane-domain deleted IYD. The two mutants were expressed in HEK 293 cells and their catalytic properties were measured. IYD-NR did not promote deiodination (Vmax = 0. 0 ± 0. 4 nmol hr- 1 ug- 1) of <b>diiodotyrosine</b> in a literature-derived iodide release assay.

H(2) O(2) {{is essential for the}} iodination of the tyrosyl residues to produce mono- and <b>diiodotyrosine</b> that are the precursors for the synthesis of T(3) and T(4). Production of H(2) O(2) in thyroid glands occurs by oxidation of endogenous D-Asp by D-AspO (D-Asp+O(2) +H(2) O [...] >alpha-oxaloacetate+NH(3) +H(2) O(2)). D-Aspartate racemase catalyzes the in vivo production of D-Asp from L-Asp. Thus, interaction of endogenous D-Asp, D-AspO, and D-aspartate racemase in thyroid gland constitutes an additional biochemical pathway for the production of H(2) O(2) and consequently for the synthesis of thyroid hormones...|$|E
