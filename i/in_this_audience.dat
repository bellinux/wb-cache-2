60|$|I {{have chosen}} these words with design, if possible, to disturb some part <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>audience</b> of half an hour's sleep, for the {{convenience}} and exercise whereof this place, at this season of the day, is very much celebrated.|$|E
6000|$|... 278. I am {{sure that}} all <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>audience</b> who were present {{yesterday}} at Dr. Acland's earnest and impressive lecture must have felt how deeply I should be moved by his closing reference to the friendship begun in our undergraduate days;--of which I will but say that, if it alone were all I owed to Oxford, the most gracious kindness of the Alma Mater would in that gift have been fulfilled to me.|$|E
60|$|Now in {{all this}} the Judge has me, and he has me on the record. I suppose he had flattered himself that I was really {{entertaining}} one set of opinions for one place and another set for another place--that I was afraid to say at one place what I uttered at another. What I am saying here I suppose I say to a vast audience as strongly tending to Abolitionism as any audience in the State of Illinois, and I believe I am saying that which, {{if it would be}} offensive to any persons and render them enemies to myself, would be offensive to persons <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>audience.</b>|$|E

6000|$|There {{might have}} been three hundred to four hundred present. At least there were three hundred horses {{tethered}} {{for the most part}} in the ring; though some of the hearers {{on the outskirts of the}} crowd stood with their bridles in their hand, ready to mount at the first signal. The circle of faces was strangely characteristic; long, serious, strongly marked, the tackle standing out in the lean brown cheeks, the mouth set and the eyes shining with a fierce enthusiasm; the shepherd, the labouring man, and the rarer laird, stood there in their broad blue bonnets or laced hats, and presenting an essential identity of type. From time to time a long-drawn groan of adhesion rose <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>audience,</b> and was propagated like a wave to the outskirts, and died away among the keepers of the horses. It had a name; it was called [...] "a holy groan." ...|$|E
60|$|How that perverse {{fidelity}} {{of passion}} pursues the villain! How madly true the woman is, and how astoundingly she lies! She has bewitched {{two or three}} persons who have taken her up, and they won’t believe in her wrong. Like Mary of Scotland, she finds adherents ready to conspire for her even in history, {{and people who have}} to deal with her are charmed, and fascinated, and bedevilled. How devotedly Miss Strickland has stood by Mary’s innocence! Are there not scores of ladies <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>audience</b> who persist in it too? Innocent! I remember as a boy how a great party persisted in declaring Caroline of Brunswick was a martyred angel. So was Helen of Greece innocent. She never ran away with Paris, the dangerous young Trojan. Menelaus, her husband, ill-used her, and there never was any siege of Troy at all. So was Bluebeard’s wife innocent. She never peeped into the closet where the other wives were with their heads off. She never dropped the key, or stained it with blood; and her brothers were quite right in finishing Bluebeard, the cowardly brute! Yes, Caroline of Brunswick was innocent: and Madame Laffarge never poisoned her husband; and Mary of Scotland never blew up hers; and poor Sophia Dorothea was never unfaithful; and Eve never took the apple—it was a cowardly fabrication of the serpent’s.|$|E
60|$|This intense apathy {{in all of}} us is {{the first}} great mystery of life; it stands in the way of every perception, every virtue. There is no making {{ourselves}} feel enough astonishment at it. That the occupations or pastimes of life should have no motive, is understandable; but--That life itself should have no motive--that we neither care {{to find out what it}} may lead to, nor to guard against its being for ever taken away from us--here is a mystery indeed. For just suppose I were able to call at this moment to any one <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>audience</b> by name, and to tell him positively that I knew a large estate had been lately left to him on some curious conditions; but that though I knew it was large, I did not know how large, nor even where it was--whether in the East Indies or the West, or in England, or at the Antipodes. I only knew it was a vast estate, and that there was a chance of his losing it altogether if he did not soon find out on what terms it had been left to him. Suppose I were able to say this positively to any single man <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>audience,</b> and he knew that I did not speak without warrant, do you think that he would rest content with that vague knowledge, if it were anywise possible to obtain more? Would he not give every energy to find some trace of the facts, and never rest till he had ascertained where this place was, and what it was like? And suppose he were a young man, and all he could discover by his best endeavour was that the estate was never to be his at all, unless he persevered, during certain years of probation, in an orderly and industrious life; but that, according to the rightness of his conduct, the portion of the estate assigned to him would be greater or less, so that it literally depended on his behaviour from day to day whether he got ten thousand a year, or thirty thousand a year, or nothing whatever- -would you not think it strange if the youth never troubled himself to satisfy the conditions in any way, nor even to know what was required of him, but lived exactly as he chose, and never inquired whether his chances of the estate were increasing or passing away? Well, you know that this is actually and literally so with the greater number of the educated persons now living in Christian countries. Nearly every man and woman in any company such as this, outwardly professes to believe--and a large number unquestionably think they believe--much more than this; not only that a quite unlimited estate is in prospect for them if they please the Holder of it, but that the infinite contrary of such a possession--an estate of perpetual misery--is in store for them if they displease this great Land-Holder, this great Heaven-Holder. And yet there is not one in a thousand of these human souls that cares to think, for ten minutes of the day, where this estate is or how beautiful it is, or what kind of life they are to lead in it, or what kind of life they must lead to obtain it.|$|E

You've seen electricity running the newspaper press, and the same current has operated the big paper mills at Royal. Here <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>audience</b> is a gentleman from Connecticut who has accepted my invitation to look over our village with a view to building a factory here, using the power I shall hereafter be able to furnish. I am in correspondence with two other manufacturers, whom I hope to induce to locate in Millville. (Enthusiastic cheers.) Job Fisher, who used to live at Malvern, is planning to start a lumber mill, to cut the pine just north of here; so you see we are about to arouse from our long sleep and have a great future before us if we keep wide awake. Another item of news merits your attention. Bartlett has sold sixty acres of his farm to Dr. Adam Matthews, for many years a prominent physician of Boston, who is going to build a good house on the land and become a citizen of Millville. We've always had to go to Huntingdon for a doctor, but now Dr. Matthews has promised to look after the health of the Millville people, although he has retired from city practice. More people will come here from time to time, attracted by our enterprise and the rugged beauty of our county; real estate will become more valuable, trade will prosper and every one of the old inhabitants will find opportunities to make money."

40|$|There {{is no one}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>audience</b> {{who does}} not {{immediately}} recognize the descriptive referent of two phrases we will utter [...] -the Challenger space shuttle accident {{and the spread of}} AIDS virus. However, we would also venture to say, with confidence, that the quick recognition of {{what we are talking about}} would not be accompanied by a similar consensus that both one or the other, or neither, should be thought of as a disaster for research purposes. One the other hand, there is probably no one <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>audience</b> who will not only recognize, but agree, that the referents of the terms Bhopal and Chernobyl are, and should be, looked at as disaster. Why? Few of us would have trouble characterizing some aspects of the recent Mexico City earthquake or the Amaro, Columbia, volcanic mud slide as a disaster. Yet many of us would hesitate to characterize in the same way the clashes between the Soviet Union military and the native guerillas in Afghanistan, the American air strike on Lybia or the current war between Iran and Irak. Do the deaths from the famine in Ethiopia qualify as a disaster? If yes, what about the much larger number of people who die daily as a result of cigarette smoking? Why do we and other researchers characterize certain occurrences as disasters but deny this label for other phenomena also involving loss of life, substantial great destruction of property, and/or major disruption of social life? This paper struggles with the problem of what we, as researchers, should study as a disaster. In our view, this is by far the most important task currently facing the field of disaster studies, as undertaken by social and behavioral scientists. We are not going to proclaim the definitive answer. Instead, we ask some questions and advance some suggestions for researchers about the concept of disaster...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I have two main purposes: (i) to outline the most general {{structure}} of morality, {{which is the}} fundamental schema of a good society, and (ii) to indict most of the mainstream views {{in the history of}} moral philosophy for their unchecked tendency toward reductionism and oversimplification. The tendency to oversimplification appears both in the gathering of the data for philosophical theorizing and in the theorizing itself. I will also point out another major recurring error in moral philosophy. I envision the day when moral philosophers, after examining their ontological and their methodological assumptions, rally to the banner of anti-reductionism and complexification. Since reductionism and oversimplification are also widespread throughout the theory of the foundations of social sciences, this particular battle may, hopefully, provide also a worthwhile spectacle for the social scientists <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>audience...</b>|$|E

40|$|John Bell’s {{emphasis}} of the essential ambiguities in anomaly calculations is recalled. Some descendants of the anomaly are reviewed. 1 John Bell and the Chiral Anomaly I expect that most everyone <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>audience</b> knows that John Bell codiscovered the mechanism of anomalous symmetry breaking in quantum field theory. Indeed, our paper on this subject [1] is his (and my) most-cited work. The symmetry breaking in question is a quantum phenomenon that violates the correspondence principle; it arises from the necessary infinities of quantum field theory. Over the years it has become evident that theoretical/mathematical physicists {{are not the only}} ones to acknowledge this effect. Nature makes fundamental use of the anomaly in at least two ways: the neutral pion’s decay into two photons is controlled by the anomaly [1, 2] and elementary fermions (quarks and leptons) arrange themselves in patterns such that the anomaly cancels in those channels to which gauge bosons – photon, W, Z – couple [3]. (There are also phenomenological applications of the anomaly to collective, as opposed to fundamental, physics – for example, to edge states in the quantum Hall effect.) Beyon...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{considers}} {{the problems of}} applying the Russian as a foreign language teaching technique for teaching literature at pre-university department. In spite of the reduced scope of additional educational program in literature as provided for by the new requirements, <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>audience,</b> studying the Russian writers’ works corps is coupled with difficulties of both linguistic and mental nature. The teaching starts in groups having A 1 mastery level of Russian, and, alongside with the non-mother tongue, the attendees have to master a course of Russian literature ranging from folklore and Old Russian literature {{to that of the}} 20 th century within an incomplete academic year. The specific character of students’ audience and program requirements prescribe the necessary use of the main principles of RFL teaching – communicative, linguistic, didactic and psychological ones. The authors of the paper pay a special attention to practical application of the said principles giving numerous examples of study assignments and exercises of various types. The paper can be targeted to RFL teachers, students of philology and to everyone interested in problems of techniques of teaching literature in a non-mother tongues...|$|E
