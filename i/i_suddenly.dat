25|$|In December 1350, King Kyawswa <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> died, and was {{succeeded by}} his son Kyawswa II. Saw Ke did not get along with Kyawswa II, who was not only his second cousin but also brother-in-law. (Kyawswa II's chief queen was Saw Ke's {{youngest}} sister Saw Omma.) Saw Ke defected to Sagaing, whose reigning king Tarabya II was also a second cousin of his. His defection was a second major defection to Sagaing in two years, following an even higher profile defection of Gov. Nawrahta of Pinle in 1349. But the king of Sagaing sent an embassy led by Princess Soe Min and Gov. Thado Hsinhtein of Tagaung to cool the tensions. The embassy was successful, and the peace between the two Burmese-speaking kingdoms was maintained. Tarabya II appointed Saw Ke governor of Amyint, a small region west of Sagaing.|$|E

In the film, Astaire [...] suffers from what Rogers terms an [...] "affliction": [...] "Every {{once in a while}} <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> find myself dancing." [...] Astaire introduces the film's tap motif when he blasts a tap barrage at the somnolent members of a London Club. There are eight musical numbers.|$|E

In 1962 he fainted during a performance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. In 1963 he collapsed again after being presented with the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, Britain's highest musical honour. The presentation was made by Sir Adrian Boult, who recalled that as they left the platform, [...] "Monteux gave two little groans as we walked down the passage, and <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> found my arms full of violins and bows. The orchestra had recognized the signs. Their beloved chief was fainting." [...] Monteux suffered another collapse the following year, and David Zinman and Lorin Maazel deputised for him at the Festival Hall.|$|E

500|$|Short Cuts {{was one of}} a trio of {{successive}} film appearances that boosted Moore's reputation. It {{was followed}} in 1994 with Vanya on 42nd Street, a filmed version of her ongoing Uncle Vanya workshop production, directed by Louis Malle. Moore's performance of Yelena was described as [...] "simply outstanding" [...] by Time Out, and she won the Boston Society of Film Critics award for Best Actress. Following this, Moore was given her first leading role, playing an unhappy suburban housewife who develops multiple chemical sensitivity in Todd Haynes' low-budget film Safe (1995). She had to lose a substantial amount of weight for the role, which made her ill, and she vowed never to change her body for a film again. In their review, Empire magazine writes that Safe [...] "first established [...] credentials as perhaps the finest actress of her generation." [...] The film historian David Thomson later described it as [...] "one of the most arresting, original and accomplished films of the 1990s," [...] and the performance earned Moore an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Actress. Reflecting on these three roles, Moore has said, [...] "They all came out at once, and <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> had this profile. It was amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|I Am... (January 2002) marked several {{milestones}} for Hamasaki. Hamasaki increased {{her control}} over her music by composing {{all of the}} songs on the album under the pseudonym [...] "Crea", of which the 2000 single [...] "M" [...] was the first. [...] "Connected" [...] (November 2002) and [...] "A Song Is Born" [...] (December 2001) were the exceptions. I Am... also showed evolution in Hamasaki's lyrical style: it was a retreat from the themes of [...] "loneliness and confusion" [...] of some of her earlier songs. Moved by the September 11 attacks, Hamasaki revised her vision of I Am..., focusing {{on issues such as}} faith and world peace. [...] "A Song Is Born", in particular, was directly influenced by the events. The single, a duet with Keiko Yamada, was released as part of Avex's non-profit Song Nation project, which raised money for charity."まず、浜崎あゆみとKEIKOがデュエットした『a song is born』が2001年12月12日にリリースされた。" [...] She also dropped the planned cover and opted instead to be portrayed as a [...] "peace muse", explaining, I had a completely different idea for the cover at first. We'd already reserved the space, decided the hair and makeup and everything. But after the incident, as is typical of me, <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> changed my mind. I knew it wasn't the time for gaudiness, for elaborate sets and costumes. It sounds odd coming from me, but I realize what I say and how I look has a great impact.|$|E

2500|$|However, in 1988 Anna Wing {{began to}} grow disillusioned with the {{direction}} the show was going in.

His body was as large as a medium-sized native's and he had thick square shoulders, not sloping at all... he seemed to be quite as tall as I. Then I saw {{that it was not a}} man. It was not an orang-utan. I had seen one of these large apes a short time before. It was more like a monstrously large siamang, but a siamang has long hair, and there was no doubt that it had short hair.|$|E

2500|$|Producer Ken Nelson took a {{hands-off}} {{approach to}} producing Haggard. In the episode of American Masters dedicated to him, Haggard remembers: [...] "The producer I had at that time, Ken Nelson, was {{an exception to}} the rule. He called me 'Mr. Haggard' and I was a little twenty-four, twenty-five year old punk from Oildale... He gave me complete responsibility. I think if he'd jumped in and said, 'Oh, you can't do that,' it would've destroyed me." [...] In the documentary series Lost Highway, Nelson recalls, [...] "When I first started recording Merle, I became so enamored with his singing that I would forget what else was going on, and <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> realized, 'Wait a minute, there's musicians here you've got to worry about!' But his songs—he was a great writer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shore {{was born}} in Toronto, Canada, to Henry and Charlotte Shore. She was the {{youngest}} of seven children. She was drawn to both painting and nature at a young age, remarking [...] "I was on my way home from school and saw myself reflected in a puddle. It was the first time I had seen my image completely surrounded by nature, and <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> had an overwhelming sense of belonging to it—of actually being part of every tree and flower. I was filled with a desire to tell what I felt through painting." [...] Shore's mother supported Shore's artistic ambitions, but advised her to learn practical matters as well. After taking a domestic education class, at the age of 15, Shore began studying painting with the Canadian Impressionist Laura Muntz Lyall. Her works at this time are mostly genre scenes and thus conform to subject matter that would have been popular in Toronto's traditional art scene during the period.|$|E

2500|$|Gower was {{repeatedly}} lambasted {{by the media}} as being [...] "laid back" [...] or [...] "nonchalant" [...] with a [...] "devil-may-care" [...] approach some found infuriating, as Wisden records, [...] "the difference between an exquisite stroke and a nick {{was little more than}} an inch" [...] in his style of batting. Peter Roebuck recorded that [...] "Gower never moves, he drifts" [...] while Frances Edmonds in the Daily Express spoke of Gower in 1985: [...] "Difficult to be more laid back without being actually comatose." [...] Gower himself commented in 1995 in an interview in The Independent: [...] "I was never destined to be on the ball 100 per cent of the time. I don't have the same ability that Graham Gooch has, to produce something very close to his best every time he plays.

2500|$|Between 1962 and 1964, Garcia {{sang and}} {{performed}} mainly bluegrass, old-time, and folk music.

Soon after this, Garcia, Weir, Ron [...] "Pigpen" [...] McKernan, and several of their friends formed a jug band called Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. Around this time, the psychedelic LSD was gaining popularity. Garcia first began using LSD in 1964; later, when asked how it changed his life, he remarked: [...] "Well, it changed everything [...] the effect was that it freed me because <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> realized that my little attempt at having a straight life and doing that was really a fiction and just wasn't going to work out. Luckily I wasn't far enough into it {{for it to be}} shattering or anything; it was like a realization that just made me feel immensely relieved".|$|E
