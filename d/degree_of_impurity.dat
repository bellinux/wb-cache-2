Thus, aggregation, corrosion, and interaction with extracellular matrix proteins critically modify NP features and fate. These modifications depend to a large extent on the characteristics of the biological media in which the NPs are dispersed. As a consequence, when reviewing the scientific literature, it seems that the aggregation state of NPs, which depends on the characteristics of the dispersing media, may be more significant than the composition or original size of the NPs.

In 0. 35 μm trenches, however, both the current density and brightening additive level affected the final grain size.

Unfortunately, because of the limited amount of information available, the models presently being used to predict ITER performance simply assume a flat concentration profile for all impurities with an ad hoc concentration chosen for each impurity. In an attempt to start closing the gap between present experimental data and these models, experiments have been conducted on DIII-D with particular emphasis placed on (1) characterizing the buildup of intrinsic impurities in the plasma core in various confinement and divertor regimes; (2) measuring the steady-state impurity density profiles in various operating regimes; and (3) determining whether impurity transport properties are dependent on the charge of the impurity.

40|$|Thick, {{commonly}} lateritic regoliths are {{widespread in}} inter-tropical {{regions of the}} world, and present a challenges to current exploration techniques. The particular problem in Australian is the widespread deep and varied regolith, frequently with a complex geological history dating back to mid-Permian time. Within this long period, several episodes of deep weathering and selective chemical solution, transport and precipitation, differential erosion, and deposition of sediment, so that the primary features of primary ore deposits are considerably modified and deeply concealed. The lateritic and saprolitic Au associated with subsurface depletion {{is one of the}} most common results of the deep weathering. With these problems in mind, an integrated paramagnetic/lithogeochemical technique has been developed in the exploration for gold in heavily weathered terrain. This technique is based on the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>impurity</b> in quartz associated with ore deposits and measured by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) powder spectroscopy and chemical analysis of the quartz rich acid insoluble residue of the regolith. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, which measures microwave absorption by unpaired electrons in a magnetic field, is a new concept in mineral exploration as quartz samples from mineralized zones often have strong EPR signals due to lattice imperfections. Quartz associated with mineralization has stronger electron paramagnetism than the barren quartz, whilst the EPR signals of residual quartz, including secondary chalcedony with inclusion of primary quartz, are not strongly affected by weathering. The acid treatment consists of sequential treatment of regolith samples with hot aqua regia, nitric acid and sulphuric acid, dissolving residual sulphides, iron, manganese and aluminium oxides and hydroxides, carbonates, phosphates, sulphates and clay minerals. The remaining acid insoluble residue consists of quartz with some residue sericite, rutile and traces of other resistate minerals. Three areas with a well described regolith profile and known bulk geochemistry were selected: the Mystery Zone, Mt Percy, at Kalgoorlie, the Rand Pit, Reedy Mine near Meekatharra in Western Australia, and Jim's Find in the Tanami Desert of Northern Territory. The depth of weathering in these areas varies between rock types, but generally below surface 60 - 90 m. As strong acid digestion, most of the weathering products have been removed from the reglith samples and this acid insoluble residue reflects the primary signature. In the acid insoluble residue, quartz associated with mineralization has an EPR spectra typical of lattice imperfections. Case studies of the Mystery Zone, Mt. Percy, the Rand Pit, Reedy Mine and the Jim's Find, Tanami have pronounced EPR signals at the surface above the mineralized zones as well as in Au depletion zones and in the wall rock alteration halos. The distribution of EPR 326. 5 ± 5 m T is in accordance with the distribution of certain trace elements, such as Al, K, Rb, W, V, Ga and Ge in all three working areas. In addition, wall rock alteration patterns are commonly expressed by strong [Al 04] 0 centers in the EPR spectra, accompanied by increased K and Rb concentrations, and high Rb/Kand Rb/Al ratios. In contrast, the intensity of EPR 326. 5 ± 100 m T resembles the element distribution of Fe, Mn, Zn and Ni indicating that EPR 326. 5 ± 5 mT weakly reflects the distribution of alteration. In the acid insoluble residue, the chemical expression of sericitic wall rock is Al, K Rb, V, Ga and W enrichment, high Rb/K ratios in surface material above mineralization, and high Rb/Al ratios in wall rocks. Aluminium, K, Rb, Ga, V, and W related to sericitic alteration in the acid insoluble residue, are commonly good indicators of Au mineralization through the regolith. In the Mystery Zone, Rand Pit and Jim's Find, Al, Cr, Ga, K, Rb, V, W, Rb/K and Rb/ Al consistently define the location of Au mineralization. The composite halos Al x K x Rb, Ga+Ge and As+ W +Mo also enhance the mineralization halo, with these cumulative indices more useful than the single low-level elements of Ge, As and Mo. Sodium, Ca and Sr depletion is caused by plagioclase destruction. Titanium, Zr, Nb, and possibly V, have a strong correlation to lithological variation and are surface enriched in resistate minerals. However, the acid insoluble residue of near surface material likely reflects secondary dispersion patterns of Ca, Sr, Cr, Cl and S presumably due to extrapment of submicroscopic inclusions. Similar results may be obtained for these and other potential pathfinder elements, like As, Sb, Bi and Cu, by total geochemical analysis of whole rock pulps. However, not all Au deposits have an associated suite of pathfinder elements, whilst research presented in this thesis suggests that there is always an EPR signal and high Al, K, Rb, V, Ga and W chemical expression in the acid insoluble residue...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: According to statistics, opioid {{addiction}} {{is quite common}} in Iran. Pathologic dilatation of the Common Bile Duct (CBD) {{may be caused by}} mechanical obstruction or opioid consumption; the latter is especially common among chronic opium abusers. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the relationship between CBD diameter and addiction-related factors in opium users. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad, Iran. A checklist, consisting of 18 items on demographic characteristics, type, administration route, and duration of opioid consumption, and type of biliary disease as indicated by Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), was prepared and completed via interview. The results of ERCP and abdominal ultrasonography of 40 addicted patients were gathered. Data were analyzed, using SPSS version 11. 5. P-value less than 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: In total, 31 (62 %) out of 50 patients were male, and the mean age of the subjects was 66 ± 12. 0 years. According to the findings, 46 (92 %) cases were addicted to opium and four (8 %) cases to laudanum (a solution prepared from opium). Among the addicted cases, 30 (75 %) used opium through inhalation, while 10 (25 %) cases used it orally. There was a significant relationship between the type of opioid and CBD diameter (P= 0. 03). However, no significant relationship was found between CBD diameter and the route of administration or opioid dose (P= 0. 6 and 0. 06, respectively). Conclusion: Opium used by addicts has various <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>impurity.</b> It can be concluded that higher opium purity induces more CBD dilatation, although further investigations are highly recommended...|$|R
40|$|Zirconium diboride, ZrB 2, is {{a ceramic}} {{material}} with bulk properties {{such as high}} melting point (3245 °C), high hardness (23 GPa), and low resistivity (~ 8 μΩcm). Thin film growth of ZrB 2 using physical vapor deposition has suffered from problems with films deviating from stoichiometry and {{with high levels of}} contaminants, especially high oxygen content. The homogeneity range of ZrB 2 is very narrow, and consequently it is vital to achieve the correct stoichiometry to grow films with high crystalline order. This thesis describes a direct current magnetron sputtering process to grow stoichiometric ZrB 2 thin films with a low <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>impurities.</b> Growth <b>of</b> epitaxial ZrB 2 films was achieved on 4 H-SiC(0001), Si(111) and Al 2 O 3 (0001) substrates. The effect of deposition temperature and power applied on the sputtering target was investigated and showed that high power density (8. 77 Wcm- 2) and high temperature (900 °C) resulted in films with the best composition and the highest crystal quality. ZrB 2 films on GaN(0001) templates exhibit an amorphous layer at the film-substrate interface and the resulting films are either polycrystalline or textured. Resistivity measurements showed that the ZrB 2 thin films exhibit typical resistivity values of ~ 100 - 250 μΩcm and that the resistivity decreased with increasing deposition temperature. Nanoindentation was applied to assess the mechanical properties of the films. The epitaxial ZrB 2 films exhibit high elastic recovery and a hardness of ~ 45 - 50 GPa, twice as high as the literature bulk value. In addition, evaluation of the mechanical properties was performed at high temperatures of up to 600 °C and showed that the epitaxial films retained a higher hardness, compared to textured ZrB 2 films and bulk, also at these temperatures...|$|R
30|$|The {{permeability}} of {{the soil}} {{is directly related to}} the effective porosity {{of the soil}} and is greatly influenced by grains shape, size grains, adsorbed water, voids ratio, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> saturation and <b>impurities</b> present (Punmia et al. 2005). The soil is an important factor for delineating the groundwater potential zones. The analysis of the soil type reveals that the study area is covered with different soil types namely, red loamy, red sandy, younger alluvial, laterite and old alluvial occupying area of about 829  km 2 (17 %), 261  km 2 (6 %), 318  km 2 (7 %), 2236  km 2 (48 %) and 977  km 2 (21 %), respectively (Fig.  4 c).|$|R
40|$|Wet {{grinding}} process {{is an interesting}} means of producing fine and nano particles. The particle sizing {{plays an important role}} in interpretation, control and optimization of various aspects of the wet {{grinding process}}. There is a lack of knowledge in understanding different aspects of particle sizing during a wet grinding process. The particle sizing in a wet grinding process is typical in the sense: (i) The dispersions in a wet grinding process, often, involve additives and (or) impurities. It is less known how impurities and additives influence the particle size of the dispersions in the wet grinding process. (ii) In a wet grinding process, dispersions of different concentrations may be used. It is less known how dispersions of different concentration may influence the particle sizing in a wet grinding process. (iii) In a wet grinding process, the change in average particle size of the product is rapid due to relatively fast breakage of the particles. (iv) The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> poly dispersity in product changes with grinding time. (v) The nature of interaction between particles is non-colloidal before grinding process; this interaction becomes colloidal after a certain grinding time. Similarly, there is a lack of knowledge to understand how quality of final ground product is influenced in a wet grinding process. This study investigates the different aspects of particle sizing and product quality of aqueous dispersions of CaCO 3 in a wet grinding process carried out in a stirred media mill. Acoustic attenuation spectroscopy that is known for measuring particle size of dispersions on line, under real process conditions and without diluting the sample has been employed in the study in addition to the technique of dynamic light scattering. The study brings out the conditions in which the effects <b>of</b> <b>impurities</b> and additives etc. on particle size of the dispersions may be determined using acoustic attenuation spectroscopy. Furthermore, the study compares and analyze the particle sizing results obtained though acoustic attenuation spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering. The causes of differences in the results of two techniques have been investigated. We report presence of multiple scattering at high concentration of the dispersions during wet grinding process that result in misleading results of the particles sizes. Quality is an intangible concept. In order to understand how different operating parameters influence product quality, we propose a method based upon the definition of quality as defined in ISO 9000 : 2005. The method takes into consideration the important operating parameters of wet grinding process (such as the operating condition of the mill, the measurement of particle size and the material) and important product characteristics (such as average particle size, range of width of particle size distribution, stability <b>of</b> dispersion, <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>impurities,</b> specific energy input and physical appearance). We bring out how a relationship between operating parameters and products of different grades may be established in a wet grinding process...|$|R
