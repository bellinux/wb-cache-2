A recording of it was also commercially released on VHS in 1997, and a CD with the songs from the musical was released too.|$|E

500|$|The film's casting directors, John Hubbard and {{his wife}} Ros Hubbard, {{travelled}} to Dublin, Ireland in April 1990, and spent two months visiting local clubs {{in their search for}} musicians to appear in the film. In June of that year, Parker travelled to Dublin and placed an advertisement in the magazine Hot Press, requesting young artists to audition for roles in the film. Parker wanted actors who could play a musical instrument and resembled the characters from the novel. He said, [...] "I would stop kids busking (performing for change) on the streets and call them in to audition... we had to choose <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> quite talented, because they had to play musicians who were awful at first, but gradually improved." ...|$|E
500|$|Super Columbine Massacre {{was created}} by Danny Ledonne of Alamosa, Colorado, then a student and {{independent}} filmmaker. As a high school student, the Columbine shootings resonated with Ledonne, {{who said that he}} himself had once been [...] "a loner", [...] "a misfit" [...] and [...] "a bullied kid" [...] in high school like the shooters. [...] "I was an easy target to be picked on, and that started in kindergarten," [...] he said. [...] "It was the kind of bullying that most <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> bullied experienced [...] When you get pushed every day, and when you are ostracized not once, not twice, but years in and out, your perception of reality is distorted [...] These things really do warp your understanding and your perception of humanity in some almost irrevocable way," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|... "Gallaher played many dashing games," [...] the British {{newspaper}} The Sportsman reported {{after his}} death, [...] "and led his side from one success to another {{until they were}} deemed invincible. He was a veritable artist, who never deserved all the hard things said about him, especially in South Wales. A great player, a great judge of the game". Gallaher's military experience gave him an appreciation for [...] "discipline, cohesion and steadiness under pressure." [...] He was however quiet, even dour, and preferred to lead by example. He insisted players spend an hour [...] "contemplating the game ahead" [...] on match days, and also that they pay attention to detail. Original All Black Ernie Booth wrote of Gallaher: [...] "To us All Blacks his words would often be, 'Give nothing away; take no chance.' As a skipper he was somewhat a disciplinarian, doubtless imbibed from his previous military experience in South Africa. Still, he treated us all like men, not <b>kids,</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> out to 'play the game' for good old New Zealand." [...] Another contemporary said he was [...] "perhaps not the greatest of wing-forwards, as such; but he was acutely skilled as a judge of men and moves".|$|E

500|$|In {{adapting}} the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing {{the names of}} the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to [...] "a small New Mexico town." [...] Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that [...] "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely…we need that childlike innocence." [...] He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so [...] "we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story." [...] The filmmakers have noted that [...] "they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context", {{while at the same time}} paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that [...] "the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book." [...] Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating [...] "There are things that [...] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it." [...] In {{adapting the}} story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's [...] "evil empire speech" [...] as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, [...] "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he [...] "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [...] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> terrorizing you every day?

2500|$|In 1949, {{outraged that}} {{existing}} adoption services considered Asian and mixed-race children unadoptable, Buck co-founded Welcome House, Inc., the first international, interracial adoption agency, along with James A. Michener, Oscar Hammerstein II {{and his second}} wife Dorothy Hammerstein. In nearly five decades of work, Welcome House has placed over five thousand children. In 1964, to support <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not eligible for adoption, Buck established the Pearl S. Buck Foundation (now called Pearl S. Buck International) to [...] "address poverty and discrimination faced by children in Asian countries". In 1964, she opened the Opportunity Center and Orphanage in South Korea, and later offices were opened in Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam. When establishing Opportunity House, Buck said, [...] "The purpose...is to publicize and eliminate injustices and prejudices suffered by children, who, because of their birth, {{are not permitted to}} enjoy the educational, social, economic and civil privileges normally accorded to children." ...|$|E
2500|$|Raï (...) {{is a form}} of folk music, {{originated}} in Oran, Algeria from Bedouin shepherds, mixed with Spanish, French, African and Arabic musical forms, which dates back to the 1930s and has been primarily evolved by women in the culture. Raï has been forbidden music in Algeria, to the point of one popular singer being assassinated, although since the 1980s it has enjoyed some considerable success. The song [...] "Parisien Du Nord" [...] by Cheb Mami is a recent example of how the genre has been used as form of protest, as the song was written as a protest against the racial tensions that sparked the 2005 French riots. According to Memi: It is a song against racism, so I wanted to sing it with a North African who was born in France [...] Because of that and because of his talent, I chose K-Mel. In the song, we say, 'In your eyes, I feel like foreigner.' It's like the <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> born in France but they have Arab faces. They are French, and they should be considered French." ...|$|E
2500|$|Further, {{criticism}} of Penn State leadership and Paterno himself, including calls for his dismissal, followed reports of these arrests for {{their role in}} [...] "protecting Penn State's brand instead of a child", and allowing Sandusky to retain emeritus status and unfettered access to the university's football program and facilities, despite knowledge of the allegations of sexual abuse. In an interview with New York City radio station WFAN, sports reporter Kim Jones, a Penn State alumna, stated that, [...] "I can't believe [...] heart is that black, where he simply never thought about [...] again and never thought about those poor <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> looking for a male mentor, a strong man in their life." [...] Former sports commentator Keith Olbermann called for Paterno to be immediately fired, saying that [...] "he failed all of the kids—the kid kids and the player kids—he purported to be protecting." [...] In an editorial for the Centre Daily Times, literary critic Robert Bernard Hass, a Penn State alumnus, compared Joe Paterno's downfall to a Greek tragedy and suggested that despite Paterno's many good deeds, pride and age contributed to his failure to report the incident to police.|$|E

2500|$|Significant edits {{were made}} to {{aggressive}} and violent lyrics that were aimed at police, prostitutes, women, homosexuals, and schools. In response to the attack that had occurred at Columbine High School in April 1999, names of guns and sounds of them firing were censored. [...] Interscope Records insisted on censoring the words [...] "kids" [...] and [...] "Columbine" [...] from the line [...] "I take seven [...] from , stand them all in line" [...] from [...] "I'm Back", even on the explicit version of the album. Mike Rubin of Spin called the censorship a [...] "curious decision, given that lyrics like 'Take drugs / Rape sluts' are apparently permissible". Eminem commented on his lyrics regarding the shooting, [...] "That Columbine shit is so fucking touchy. As much sympathy as we give the Columbine shootings, nobody ever looked {{at it from the}} fuckin' {{point of view of the}} <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> bullied—I mean, they took their own fucking life! And it was because they were pushed so far to the fucking edge that they were fucking so mad. I've been that mad." [...] The full line appears uncensored in Eminem's song [...] "Rap God" [...] from The Marshall Mathers LP 2. The line [...] "It doesn't matter [...] faggot" [...] was also censored from [...] "Marshall Mathers", which refers to his mother Debbie Nelson's lawyer, who assisted her in filing a lawsuit against the rapper for defamation regarding lyrics from The Slim Shady LP.|$|E
2500|$|The {{burning of}} Brody had devoured {{almost half of}} the town – several hundred {{exclusively}} Jewish houses...With its old market place, the unsigned area looked impoverished and dejected. Many stores, especially the bigger one and richer ones, were locked or boarded up…The instant…I entered the market, we were surrounded by whole army of poor, ragged, famished <b>kids,</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> begging for a kopek. Most of them were Christian, but three or four were jewish. I gave each child a few kopeks, no matter what is his religion. But the instant I handed a coin to a Jew, all Christian children began shouting at me: [...] "Don’t give him anything! Don’t give him anything! He is a Jew! The children were joined by a Jewish beggar, a strange woman of about sixty. She wore a red dress, her grey hair was powdered, and her movements were nervous. She stood before me, grinning, her nasty, hungry eyes glaring at me, and she sort of danced a little. Then in a hoarse voice, mangling the language, she began warbling a sentimental Russian song, [...] "Ptichka Kanareyka", dearest little canary, about a young man who sends out a canary with a greeting for his beloved. The old beggar woman's screechy voice and outlandish appearance made a terrible impression on me. I gave her some coins and tried to hurry off. But she blocked my way, taring into my eyes and squawking her horrible song. She plainly expected me to be surprised that she could sing in Russian. I was haunted {{for the rest of the}} day by the nightmare of the beggar's appearance and performance.|$|E
