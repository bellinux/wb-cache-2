In March 2014, playwright Rolin Jones told the Hartford Courant that he was writing a new screenplay for the film. Comparing it to the musical, Jones said, [...] "The <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it a little dirtier and a little nastier and translate it into visual terms.

60|$|Her {{first and}} {{greatest}} <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{out of this}} room, his private study, with the compromising papers. Not a trace of them must be found here, if he <b>were</b> <b>to</b> remain beyond suspicion.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, there isn't {{anything}} more. You {{know how}} Miss Kilburn {{here has been}} round throwing ridicule on Brother Peck, because he wants the shop-hands treated with common decency, and my <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the two together and see how she would feel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a poor invention. It doesn't deceive. Their <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> me {{drunk and}} leave me under the table, and from their {{standpoint}} this will be very funny. But they don't know me. I am familiar with champagne and have no prejudices against it." ...|$|E
60|$|In his {{straddling}} wide forward-step, and his springy side-wise {{series of}} hops, and his impudent air, and his cunning way of canting {{his head to}} one side upon occasion, he reminds one of the American blackbird. But the sharp resemblances stop there. He is much bigger than the blackbird; and he lacks the blackbird's trim and slender and beautiful build and shapely beak; and of course his sober garb of gray and rusty black is a poor and humble thing compared with the splendid lustre of the blackbird's metallic sables and shifting and flashing bronze glories. The blackbird is a perfect gentleman, in deportment and attire, and is not noisy, I believe, except when holding religious services and political conventions in a tree; but this Indian sham Quaker is just a rowdy, and is always noisy when awake--always chaffing, scolding, scoffing, laughing, ripping, and cursing, and carrying on about something or other. I never saw such a bird for delivering opinions. Nothing escapes him; he notices everything that happens, and brings out his opinion about it, particularly if it is a matter that is none of his business. And it is never a mild opinion, but always violent--violent and profane--the presence of ladies does not affect him. His opinions are not the outcome of reflection, for he never thinks about anything, but heaves out the opinion that is on top in his mind, and which is often an opinion about some quite different thing and does not fit the case. But that is his way; his main <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out an opinion, and if he stopped to think he would lose chances.|$|E

5000|$|Gonne {{remained}} {{very active}} in Paris. In 1913, she established L'Irlande Libre a French newspaper. She wanted Cumann na mBan <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered seriously: her <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> affiliation with the English Red Cross, and wrote to Geneva to gain an international profile for the new nationalist organization.

50|$|Good cop/bad cop is an {{interrogation}} {{technique in}} which the officers take different sides. The 'bad cop' takes a negative stance on the subject.

Starting with cats you will examine the different types of animals listed above then heal and return them to their owners. In return, you will gain money and proceed onto your next goal.|$|E

5000|$|Heckling often {{occurs during}} stand up comedy performances, {{particularly}} at open stage performances, and/or where alcoholic beverages are being consumed.

When you've come out of the club circuit and all that and you're in the concert hall...they should be gone."
