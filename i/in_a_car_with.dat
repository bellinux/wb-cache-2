5|$|Heydrich was, for {{all intents}} and purposes, {{military}} dictator of Bohemia and Moravia. His changes to the government's structure left President Emil Hacha and his cabinet virtually powerless. He often drove alone <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>with</b> an open roof—a show of his confidence in the occupation forces and in his government's effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Holloway {{was last}} seen by her classmates around 1:30a.m. on Monday, May 30 as she was leaving the Oranjestad bar and nightclub Carlos'n Charlie's. She left <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>with</b> 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot—a Dutch honors student who was living in Aruba and {{attending}} the International School of Aruba— and his two Surinamese friends, 21-year-old Deepak Kalpoe (the owner of the car) and 18-year-old Satish Kalpoe. Holloway {{had been scheduled to}} fly home later that day, but did not appear for her return flight. Her packed luggage and passport were found in her Holiday Inn room. Aruban authorities initiated searches for Holloway throughout the island and surrounding waters, but did not find her.|$|E
5|$|While on foot patrol, Police Constable Don Ross (Anthony Oliver) chances upon {{a gang of}} lorry hijackers {{operating}} {{from the back of}} a transport café. After seeing Diamond (George Murcell) and Johnny (David Graham) drive off <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>with</b> the manageress, Connie Williams (Miriam Karlin), apparently being held hostage in the back seat, Ross jumps onto and clings to the vehicle's side; however, he is quickly thrown into the road, suffering a head injury. Pretending to have come across the disorientated officer purely by chance, Diamond and Johnny drop Ross off at his home. Later, Williams is brought before the hijackers' wealthy ringleader, Miles (Ferdy Mayne), who warns her not to betray the gang to the authorities.|$|E

5|$|Holloway was {{scheduled}} to fly home from Aruba on May 30, 2005, but she failed to appear for her flight. She was last seen by her classmates outside of Carlos'n Charlie's, a restaurant and nightclub in Oranjestad. She was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>with</b> local residents Joran van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers, Deepak and Satish. When the three men were questioned, {{they said that they}} dropped off Holloway at her hotel and denied knowing what had become of her. Upon further investigation by authorities, Van der Sloot was arrested twice on suspicion of involvement in her disappearance and the Kalpoes were each arrested three times. Due to lack of evidence, the three suspects were released each time without being charged with a crime. Holloway's parents have criticized Aruban police for the lack of progress in the investigation and interrogation of the three men who were last seen with their daughter. The family also called for a boycott of Aruba, which gained Alabama Governor Bob Riley's support but failed to gain widespread backing.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{believes}} that the mind control device turns people's fears into paranoid delusions. Mulder tries to contact Dr. Stroman with no success. He traces Dr. Stroman's location to an empty hotel room where he finds cigarettes in the ash tray. Using the phone log for the room Mulder tracks Stroman to a house where he spots him meeting with the cable repairman. However, by the time Mulder enters, shots ring out, and Mulder finds both men dead, with X (Steven Williams) responsible for their murders. X used a third party to inform Mulder, knowing he had orders to kill the men, but Mulder {{was not able to}} piece things together in time. Mulder calls him a coward but X tells Mulder that Mulder needs him. Later, X meets <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>with</b> The Smoking Man (William B. Davis).|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Nigel Dick and was filmed from 4 to 6 October 1999 at the Mission Tiki drive-in theatre in Montclair, California. In the video, Raven sings the song while she is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>with</b> a boy, while Larsen sings and plays the guitar in front of another car. This footage is mixed with M2M singing together at the drive-in, people dancing, the projectionist struggling with his malfunctioning equipment, and the concession stand worker who has an overflowing popcorn maker. When the popcorn stand explodes, M2M continue to perform surrounded by people as popcorn rains down. Air cannons were used to fire 200 garbage bin-sized bags of popcorn into the air to create the raining popcorn effect. In the US the music video made its premiere on 24 October on The WB following that night's screening of 7th Heaven. It began airing on The Box and MuchMusic in early November 1999 and began airing on MTV on 15 November.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after de Gaulle and Foccart's meeting, French commanders Haulin and Royer were {{released}} {{at the request}} of the French Embassy. Intervention could not commence without a formal petition to the Head of State of Gabon. Since M'ba was held hostage, the French contacted the Vice President of Gabon, Paul-Marie Yembit, who had not been arrested. At the time, Yembit was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>with</b> U.S. ambassador Charles Darlington travelling to N'Dende. This was to officially open a school built by the Peace Corps nearby, in Yembit's birthplace of Moussambou, and completing his electoral campaign. Therefore, they decided to compose a predated letter that Yembit would later sign, confirming their intervention. They sent this to him via a small airplane, since there were no road bridges in Gabon at the time and the only way to cross a river was on a ferry. Yembit did not come back to Libreville on the plane as would be expected, but rather at 8:00 WAT on 18 February to read a statement over Radio Libreville that was likely prepared by French officials. Yembit, however, claimed that he called for French intervention while the insurgent troops held M'ba hostage; this version of the story was quickly disputed by several diplomats on the scene, as several French troops had arrived before this alleged incident.|$|E

25|$|Frank DeSimone {{was born}} in 1909 in Pueblo, Colorado. As a child {{his family moved to}} California.

DeSimone was involved in one of the botched assassination attempts on Mickey Cohen. Jimmy Fratianno signaled DeSimone after a meeting with Cohen and DeSimone pulled up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>with</b> Frank Bompensiero, Leo Moceri, and another armed man. By the time they got past Cohen's bodyguards, Cohen escaped. With a job as an attorney, DeSimone was able to avoid police scrutiny. His lawyer career was no front job however. In the 1940s and 1950s DeSimone served as lawyer for mobsters such as Jimmy Fratianno and Johnny Roselli as well as providing legal aid to others.|$|E
25|$|Mansell {{believed}} that 1989 {{would be a}} development year {{and that he would}} be able to challenge for the championship the following season. In his first appearance with the team he scored a very unlikely win in the 1989 Brazilian Grand Prix at the Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet in Rio de Janeiro; his least favourite track, and the home race of his bitter rival Piquet. He later joked that he had booked an early flight home for halfway through the race as he predicted the car's new electronic gearbox would last only a few laps (as it had done throughout pre-season testing and in qualifying for the race). Mansell became the first driver to win a race <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>with</b> a semi-automatic gearbox. The race saw him as the first driver to win in their debut race for the Scuderia since Mario Andretti had won the 1972 South African Grand Prix and he would remain the last man to win on his Ferrari debut until Kimi Räikkönen won the 2007 Australian Grand Prix.|$|E
