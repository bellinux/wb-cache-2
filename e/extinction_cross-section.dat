40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} the {{dielectric}} environment on the optical extinction spectra of gold nanorods were quantitatively studied using individual bare and silica-coated nanorods. The dispersion and amplitude of their <b>extinction</b> <b>cross-section,</b> dominated by absorption for the investigated sizes, were measured using spatial modulation spectroscopy (SMS). The experimental results were compared to calculations from a numerical model that included environmental features present in the measurements and the morphology {{and size of the}} corresponding nanorods measured by transmission electron microscopy. The combination of these experimental and theoretical tools permits a detailed interpretation of the optical properties of the individual nanorods. The measured optical extinction spectra and the <b>extinction</b> <b>cross-section</b> amplitudes were well reproduced by the numerical model for silica-coated gold nanorods, for which the silica shell provides a controlled environment. In contrast, additional environmental factors had to be assumed in the model for bare nanorods, stressing the importance of controlling and characterizing the experimental conditions when measuring the optical response of bare surface-deposited single metal nanoparticles...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic-plasmonic nanoparticles, {{combining}} magnetic and plasmonic components, {{are promising}} structures {{for use in}} life sciences. Optical properties of core-shell magnetite-gold nanostructures, such as the wavelength of the plasmon resonance, the <b>extinction</b> <b>cross-section,</b> and the ratio of scattering to absorption at the plasmon wavelength are critical parameters {{in the search for}} the most suitable particles for envisioned applications. Using Mie theory and the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), optical spectra as a function of composition, size, and shape of core-shell nanospheres and nanorods were calculated. Calculations were done using simulated aqueous media, used throughout the life sciences. Our results indicate that in the advantageous near-infrared region (NIR), although magnetic-plasmonic nanospheres produced by available chemical methods lack the desirable tunability of optical characteristics, magnetic-plasmonic nanorods can achieve the desired optical properties at chemically attainable dimensions.

For this purpose, we combine in situ surface measurements with active remote sensing observations obtained from a great number of research programs in Paris area since 1999. Two approaches, devoted to the conversion of vertical profiles of lidar-derived extinction coefficients into PM 10, have been set up. A very good agreement is found between the theoretical and empirical methods with a discrepancy of 3 %.

On average we found an AOD under-prediction of 10 – 15 % for Ångström exponents in the range of 0 to 1 and 30 – 40 % in the range of 1 to 2. Additionally, modelled surface concentrations were evaluated against surface PM 10 measurements.

40|$|International audienceBy generalizing {{the concept}} of <b>extinction</b> <b>cross-section</b> to complex valued <b>extinction</b> <b>cross-section</b> we analyze the {{coupling}} between plasmon modes in metallic dimers or quadrumers. Identifying the phase information in the field scattered by subsets of the whole plasmonic system allows to infer the formation of subradiant or super-radiant hybrid modes. We also propose a phenomenological modeling based {{on the use of}} coupled mode equations to deduce from rigorous calculations a quantitative estimate of mutual coupling coefficients when only two modes interfere. These coefficients determine the spectral position of hybrid modes. This approach is applied to two interacting silver spheres; the parameters of the energetic diagram are calculated {{as a function of the}} gap between spheres. In the case of two identical spheres illuminated with a linearly polarized light parallel or perpendicular to the dimer, only one hybrid mode is excited. The phenomenological modeling is then applied to a four-particle system, where the interaction between the initial dipolar modes gives rise to Fano resonances. In a weak coupling regime of the system, the asymmetric line profile in the extinction spectra of the system emerges from the superposition of a broad super-radiant mode and a sharp subradiant mode. A strong coupling regime is characterized by a broadened subradiant mode and a larger Fano resonance. The sharpness of the Fano resonance in the weak coupling regime makes this structure well suited for sensing applications...|$|E

40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{familiar}} concepts when discussing acoustic scattering by bubbles are the resonance frequency for bubble pulsation, the bubbles' damping, and their scattering and <b>extinction</b> <b>cross-sections,</b> {{all of which are}} used routinely in oceanography, sonochemistry, and biomedicine. The apparent simplicity of these concepts is illusory: there exist multiple, sometimes contradictory definitions for their components. This paper reviews expressions and definitions in the literature for acoustical cross-sections, resonance frequencies, and damping factors of a spherically pulsating gas bubble in an infinite liquid medium, deriving two expressions for resonance frequency that are compared and reconciled with two others from the reviewed literature. In order to prevent errors, care is needed by researchers when combining results from different publications that might have used internally correct but mutually inconsistent definitions. Expressions are presented for acoustical cross-sections associated with forced pulsations damped by liquid shear and (oft-neglected) bulk or dilatational viscosities, gas thermal diffusivity, and acoustic re-radiation. The concept of a dimensionless damping coefficient is unsuitable for radiation damping because different cross-sections would require different functional forms for this parameter. Instead, terms based on the ratio of bubble radius to acoustic wavelength are included explicitly in the cross-sections where needed. © 2011 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R
40|$|When a {{gas bubble}} in water {{undergoes}} forced pulsations, sound is radiated at the forcing frequency, and the scattering cross-section exhibits a resonance peak when the forcing frequency {{passes through the}} bubble’s natural frequency. At resonance, the amplitude of the scattered spherical wave {{is determined by the}} amount of damping associated with the bubble dynamics. In his 1967 article, ‘Sound propagation in the presence of bladder fish’, Weston describes a model for the through-resonance frequency dependence of the scattering and <b>extinction</b> <b>cross-sections,</b> {{based on the work of}} Andreeva (1964). In Weston’s model, if all damping terms other than radiation damping are omitted, the resonance peak is skewed, with a tendency for the scattering cross-section to increase with increasing frequency through resonance. In 1977, Medwin published ‘Acoustical determination of bubble-size spectra’, based on Eller (1970), in which he describes a similar model, according to which the predicted resonance peak is also skewed, but in the opposite direction to that predicted by Weston. If Medwin’s model turns out to be valid, this would have little impact, as his curves are already in widespread use. However, if the Andreeva-Weston model is correct, a small adjustment becomes necessary to Medwin’s curves. A possible experiment designed to establish the true frequency dependence is described, involving the ensonification of a single spherical bubble with a broadband pulse, through the bubble’s resonance frequency. If the radiation damping can be separated form other effects, the correct frequency dependence can be established by measuring the spectrum of the scattered sound...|$|R

One essential aspect of the proposed approach is the propagation in parallel of all independent uncertainty components through the data processing chain before they are combined together to form the ozone combined standard uncertainty. The independent uncertainty components contributing to the overall budget include random noise associated with signal detection, uncertainty due to saturation correction, background noise extraction, the absorption cross-sections of ozone, NO 2, SO 2, and O 2, the molecular <b>extinction</b> <b>cross-sections,</b> and the number densities of the air, NO 2, and SO 2. The expression of the individual uncertainty components and their step-by-step propagation through the ozone DIAL processing chain are thoroughly estimated. All sources of uncertainty except detection noise imply correlated terms in the vertical dimension, which requires knowledge of the covariance matrix when the lidar signal is vertically filtered. In addition, the covariance terms {{must be taken into}} account if the same detection hardware is shared by the lidar receiver channels at the absorbed and non-absorbed wavelengths. The ozone uncertainty budget is presented as much as possible in generic form (i. e., as a function of instrument performance and wavelength) so that all NDACC ozone DIAL investigators across the network can estimate, for their own instrument and in a straightforward manner, the expected impact of each reviewed uncertainty component.

40|$|International audienceStandardized {{definitions}} of vertical resolution and a standardized approach for the definition, propagation and reporting of {{uncertainty in the}} ozone lidar profiles contributing to the Network for the Detection for Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) database were recently developed. Two standardized definitions that describe homogeneously and unequivocally the impact of vertical filtering were recommended. The first definition {{is based on the}} width of the response to a Finite Impulse-type perturbation. The second definition relates to the cut-off frequency of a digital filter. Both definitions yield approximately the same values. Numerical tools (routines written in several programming languages) were developed and distributed to lidar investigators in order to implement these standardized definitions within the entire network NDACC, as well as across the tropospheric ozone network TOLNet. The proposed approach for the introduction and propagation of uncertainty in the NDACC ozone DIAL algorithms relies on the careful selection of independent uncertainty components propagated in parallel through the data processing chain before being combined together into an ozone combined standard uncertainty. The uncertainty sources contributing to the uncertainty budget include detection noise, saturation correction, background noise extraction, the absorption cross-sections of ozone, NO 2, SO 2, and O 2, the molecular <b>extinction</b> <b>cross-sections,</b> and the number densities of the air, NO 2, and SO 2. The network-wide implementation of the proposed standardized definitions and approaches now allows a clear interpretation of the effective vertical resolution of lidar profiles when compared to profiles measured by other instruments/techniques, and allows a clear understanding and interpretation of the quality and limitations of the lidar measurements within NDACC and TOLNet.

40|$|Using {{a rather}} large set of {{different}} individual metallic optical antennas, we compare directly measured electron energy-loss spectra with measured quantitative optical <b>extinction</b> and scattering <b>cross-section</b> spectra on the identical antennas. All antenna resonances lie near 1. 4 mu m wavelength. In contrast to other reports, we find identical resonance positions for electrons and photons to within the experimental errors. We discuss possible artifacts {{which can lead to}} seemingly different resonance positions in experiments. Our experimental results agree well with complete numerical calculations of both sorts of spectra...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the light {{scattering}} properties of randomly oriented, identical spheroidal particles is presented. A computation method was developed to integrate the Asano and Yamomoto solution (1975) for scattering from a homogeneous spheroid over all particle orientations; the <b>extinction</b> and scattering <b>cross-sections,</b> the asymmetry factor, and scattering matrix elements are calculated for randomly oriented prolate and oblate spheroids and compared with the calculations for spheres and laboratory measurements. The angular scattering behavior of spheroids {{is found to be}} {{different from that of the}} spheres for side scattering to backscattering directions, and prolate and oblate spheroids of the same shape parameter have similar angular scattering patterns...|$|R
