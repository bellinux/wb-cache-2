5|$|Does it {{surprise}} {{you that a}} busy man found time to finish so many volumes, many of which deal with such minute details?... He used to begin to study at night on the Festival of Vulcan, not for luck but from his love of study, long before dawn; in winter he would commence at the seventh hour... He could sleep at call, and it would come upon him and leave {{him in the middle}} of his work. Before daybreak he would go to Vespasian– for he too was a night-worker– and then set about his official duties. On his return home he would again give to study any time that he had free. Often in summer after taking a meal, which with him, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> was always a simple and light one, he would lie in the sun if he had any time to spare, and a book would be read aloud, from which he would take notes and extracts.|$|E
25|$|Choral {{music has}} become an {{important}} part of Philippine music culture. It dates back to the choirs of churches that sing during mass <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days.</b> In the middle of the 20th century, performing choral groups started to emerge and increasingly become popular as time goes by. Aside from churches, universities, schools and local communities have established choirs.|$|E

50|$|Like many Nagas, the Lothas practiced headhunting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>days.</b> After <b>the</b> {{arrival of}} Christianity, {{they gave up}} this practice.

Catholics are concentrated more in Wokha than in other parts of Nagaland.|$|R
25|$|Jianbing from Shandong {{province}} tastes crispy {{and harder}} as its batter is formed from {{the flour mixture}} that mainly contains coarse grains such as corn, sorghum and millet. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> people had Shandong-style jianbing mainly by rolling it with scallions or serving it with meat soup. Nowadays, the variety of fillings are richer and differ according to one’s preference, for example, sweet potatoes, lettuce and pork are also used as fillings.|$|E
25|$|Persian architects {{were highly}} sought <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> {{before the advent}} of Modern Architecture. For example, Badreddin Tabrizi built the tomb of Rumi in Konya in 1273 AD, while Ostad Isa Shirazi is most often {{credited}} as the chief architect (or plan drawer) of the Taj Mahal. These artisans were also highly instrumental in the designs of such edifices as Baku, Afghanistan's Minaret of Jam, The Sultaniyeh Dome, or Tamerlane's tomb in Samarkand, among many others.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> {{relaying}} moves required {{another person}} copying the moves {{of the players}} into a large board behind the players, which was then transmitted via radio or telegram. Advancements of camera allow for zooming clearly at the players' board, although relaying moves still {{had to be done}} manually. Recently, DGT chess board captures the piece movements and allows for moves to be relayed instantaneously, eliminating the need for manual relay, but due to price (around $3000 per board), it has been limited to only a few tournaments.|$|E

25|$|The House {{system was}} dropped {{for a period}} of 9 years from 1972 to 1980. In 1980, it was renamed after their trustee in their full name.

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to discern the original purpose of lanterns in connection to the festival, but {{it is certain that}} lanterns were not used in conjunction with moon-worship prior to the Tang dynasty. Traditionally, the lantern has been used to symbolize fertility, and functioned mainly as a toy and decoration. But today the lantern has come to symbolize the festival itself. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> lanterns were made in the image of natural things, myths, and local cultures. Over time, a greater variety of lanterns could be found as local cultures became influenced by their neighbors.|$|E
25|$|Zapin is a {{dance form}} popular in Malaysia, {{especially}} {{in the state of}} Johor.

It was once performed exclusively for religious ceremonies, but has become a traditional entertainment. The dancers usually perform in pairs, accompanied by a traditional music ensemble that typically consists of the gambus, accordion, violin, marwas (bongos), rebana (drum), and dok. There are various types of zapin—including zapin melayu, zapin pekajang, zapin tenglu, zapin pulau, zapin parit mastar, and zapin lenga.|$|E

25|$|When a man {{proposed}} to a woman, he visited her house, ate half a full bowl of rice handed {{to him by}} her, and returned the rest to her. If the woman ate the rest, she accepted his proposal. If she did not and put it beside her, she rejected his proposal. When a man became engaged to a woman or they learned that their engagement had been arranged, they exchanged gifts. He sent her a small engraved knife, a workbox, a spool, and other gifts. She sent him embroidered clothes, coverings for {{the back of the}} hand, leggings and other handmade clothes. According to some books, many yomeiri marriages, in which a bride went to the house of a bridegroom with her belongings to become a member of his family, were conducted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> I {{had looked}} up to MacDonald as a great leader. He had a fine {{presence}} and great oratorical power. The unpopular line which he took during the First World War seemed to mark {{him as a man}} of character. Despite his mishandling of the Red Letter episode, I had not appreciated his defects until he took office a second time. I then realised his reluctance to take positive action and noted with dismay his increasing vanity and snobbery, while his habit of telling me, a junior Minister, the poor opinion he had of all his Cabinet colleagues made an unpleasant impression. I had not, however, expected that he would perpetrate the greatest betrayal in the political history of this country... The shock to the Party was very great, especially to the loyal workers of the rank-and-file who had made great sacrifices for these men.|$|E
25|$|I think I thought I {{could handle}} things. Didn't {{know how to}} shoot music. Music had been {{important}} in my films, it was usually post production. This was tough stuff to shoot.

I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a lot of times just a few days before we shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don't think there was any other way to do it given the circumstances.|$|E

25|$|Three oracles had {{successively}} {{operated in}} Delphi – the chthonion using egkoimisi (procedure that involved {{sleeping in the}} Holy place, so as to see a revealing dream), the Kliromanteion and finally the Apollonian, with the laurel. But ever since {{the introduction of the}} cult of Dionysus at Delphi, the god that brought his followers into ecstasy and madness, the Delphic god gave oracles through Pythia, who also fell into a trance under the influence of vapors and fumes coming from the opening, the inner sanctum of the Oracle. Pythia sat on top of a tall gilded tripod that stood above the opening. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> Pythia was a virgin, young girl, but ever since Echecrates from Thessaly fell in love, kidnapped and violated a young and beautiful Pythia, a woman older than fifty years old was chosen, who dressed and wore jewelry to resemble a young maiden girl. According to tradition, Phemonoe was the first Pythia.|$|E
25|$|The Magician's Nephew {{is written}} in a lighter tone than other Chronicles of Narnia books, in {{particular}} The Last Battle, which was published after. It frequently makes use of humour; this perhaps reflects the sense of looking back at an earlier {{part of the century}} with affection, and Lewis as a middle-aged man recalling his childhood during those years. There are a number of humorous references to life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> in particular school life. Humorous exchanges also take place between Narnian animals. Jadis' attempt to conquer London is portrayed as more comical than threatening, and further humour derives from the contrast between the evil empress and Edwardian London and its social mores, and her mistaking bumbling Andrew Ketterley for a powerful sorcerer. This recalls the style of Edith Nesbit's children's books. Lewis was fond of these books, which he read in childhood, a number were set in the same period and The Magician's Nephew has some apparent references or homages to them.|$|E

500|$|According to Lebo and Bayman, {{the actual}} region of Kaniakapūpū and Kaniakapūpū Heiau (also called Kawaluna Heiau) {{was located in}} the Waolani area of Oahu; {{contemporary}} records do not mention a heiau onsite or the king building his house on top of one. Kawaluna Heiau was associated with Kūaliʻi, the 16th-century aliʻi nui of Oahu, who asserted his control of the Kona district (the area encompassing much of modern Honolulu) after a ceremony at the temple. One of the earliest references to Kaniakapūpū and its association with Kawaluna Heiau was in the [...] "Legend of Kamaakamahiai", published on August 13, 1870, in the Hawaiian-language newspaper Kuokoa.

500|$|Private {{nuisance}} {{has received}} a range of criticism, with academics arguing that its concepts are poorly defined and open to judicial manipulation; Conor Gearty has written that [...] "Private nuisance has, if anything, become even more confused and confusing. Its chapter lies neglected in the standard works, little changed over the years, its modest message overwhelmed by the excitements to be found elsewhere in tort. Any sense of direction which may have existed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> is long gone". In addition, it has been claimed that the tort of private nuisance has [...] "lost its separate identity as a strict liability tort and been assimilated in all but name into the fault-based tort of negligence", and that private and public nuisance [...] "have little in common except the accident of sharing the same name".|$|E
