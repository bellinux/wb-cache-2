5|$|In 1845, Archimandrite Porphyrius Uspensky (1804–1885), at {{that time}} head of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem and {{subsequently}} Bishop of Chigirin, visited the monastery and the codex was shown to him, together with leaves which Tischendorf <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen.</b> In 1846, Captain C. K. MacDonald visited Mount Sinai, saw the codex, and bought two codices (495 and 496) from the monastery.|$|E

5|$|Matt Barton of Gamasutra {{reported}} that Lawrence's DND (and consequently, his Telengard) was directly inspired by Whisenhunt and Wood's dnd for PLATO, with its randomized dungeons and minimalist graphics, though Lawrence recalled {{in an interview}} that he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> or known of their game. Computer Gaming World Scorpia wrote that Telengard was based on the earlier, public domain software Castle Telengard.|$|E

The designs for Paul and Linda McCartney are unusual for The Simpsons in that the characters have brown and blue irises, respectively. Most The Simpsons characters simply have black spots in the centers of their eyes.|$|E
5|$|Abu-Jamal did {{not make}} any public {{statements}} about Faulkner's murder until May 2001. In his version of events, he claimed that {{he was sitting in}} his cab across the street when he heard shouting, then saw a police vehicle, and heard the sound of gunshots. Upon seeing his brother appearing disoriented across the street, Abu-Jamal ran to him from the parking lot and was shot by a police officer. Abu-Jamal's brother William Cook, who had been stopped by the police officer, did not testify or make any statement until April 29, 2001. At that time he said that he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> who had shot Faulkner.|$|E

5|$|Although lesbian-feminism was a {{significant}} shift, not all lesbians agreed with it. Lesbian-feminism was a youth-oriented movement: its members were primarily college educated, with experience in New Left and radical causes, but they <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> any success in persuading radical organizations to take up women's issues. Many older lesbians who had acknowledged their sexuality in more conservative times felt maintaining their ways of coping in a homophobic world was more appropriate. The Daughters of Bilitis folded in 1970 over which direction to focus on: feminism or gay rights issues.|$|E
5|$|Back in London Emmeline {{was visited}} by Sylvia, who <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> {{her mother in}} years. Their {{politics}} were by now very different, and Sylvia was living, unmarried, with an Italian anarchist. Sylvia described a moment of familial affection when they met, followed by a sad distance between them. Emmeline's adopted daughter Mary, however, remembered the meeting differently. According to her version, Emmeline set her teacup down and walked silently out of the room, leaving Sylvia in tears. Christabel, meanwhile, had become a convert to Adventism and devoted {{much of her time}} to the church. The British press sometimes made light of the varied paths followed by the once indivisible family.|$|E

Chris Adler, Lamb of God's drummer, {{testified that he}} <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> anything from the back of the stage and further proclaimed that Blythe's aggressiveness is only a stage act. According to Adler, Blythe is a calm, moderate, and well-read person. The defense also presented videos from various Lamb of God concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that Blythe regularly cheers to the crowd, but not to encourage people to climb the stage.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} night of the battle, the {{garrison}} at Malakand North <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> much action despite being in the more exposed position, and had spent much of the night firing flares and manoeuvring artillery units. In response Meiklejohn ordered a reconnaissance of the vicinity, whereupon Major Gibbs, the commander of the force, encountered large groups of tribesmen in the valley. Subsequently, he was eventually ordered to collect his forces and stores from Malakand North, and transfer them into the southern camp.|$|E
5|$|Løvold was {{an active}} member of Foreningen Kristiansunderen, an {{organization}} which worked for the betterment of the town. After seeing The Little Mermaid in Copenhagen, Løvold started working to build a mermaid statue fountain in Kristiansund. The mermaid statue was never built, although he eventually secured sufficient funding to build a fountain. Løvold traveled to the United States in 1951 to visit his siblings Oscar and Lise in Minnesota, which he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> in 42 years. He also visited New York City, where he drove through the Holland Tunnel. On his way home he came in contact with Prime Minister Oscar Torp.|$|E
5|$|The Mint {{arranged}} to outsource {{part of the}} coin-making process, and pledged to flood the nation with coins by 1965. Despite an increased need for coins in an improving economy, merchants made it past the 1964 holiday season without severe shortages, though the half dollar had stopped circulating. Most Fed facilities reported sufficient supplies of cents and nickels, with some still short on dimes and quarters, and shortages of half dollars everywhere—one Fed official wrote that his branch <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> a half dollar deposited by a bank in eight months.|$|E

Stemming from such natural beauty, the Albanian government declared the area a national park in 1966.|$|R
5|$|The new {{alignment}} of US-6 was opened on December 30, 1983. The dedication was {{planned for the}} next day, but lines of cars formed at the barricades as soon as news broke that the highway was complete. Some were residents anxious to see the area or visit relatives they <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> since the slide; others were truck drivers frustrated by long detours. The Highway Patrol requested the ceremony be canceled and the highway opened early, as {{they were unable to}} disperse the crowds.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked why}} she did not {{immediately}} inform the police of Lucan's presence, Susan Maxwell-Scott said she <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> any newspapers or television news, or listened to any radio broadcasts that might have warned her {{of the importance of}} his visit. Meanwhile, Lucan's children were taken by their aunt, Lady Sarah Gibbs, to her home in Guilsborough, Northamptonshire, where they would remain for several weeks. On the day Veronica Lucan was discharged from hospital, a High Court hearing confirmed that the children could return to live with her. Repeated press intrusions later forced the family to move to a friend's home in Plymouth.|$|E
5|$|When the Communists won the Civil War and {{established}} the People's Republic in 1949, Hu Lanqi was in Shanghai with her Communist friends. She celebrated when the People's Liberation Army entered Shanghai. Her fiancé Chen Yi, whom she <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> since 1937, was appointed Shanghai's first mayor {{under the new}} regime. However, {{when she tried to}} contact Chen, she was told that he had already married {{and did not want to}} meet her. Disappointed, she helped some Buddhist friends set up a vegetarian restaurant in Shanghai, before moving to Beijing, where an old friend from her European days helped her secure a job as an accountant in a college.|$|E

5|$|While {{considering}} {{the character of}} Chang, absent since The Blue Lotus, Hergé thought of his artistic Chinese friend Zhang Chongren, whom he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> {{since the days of}} their friendship over twenty years earlier. Hergé and Zhang used to spend every Sunday together, during which Hergé learned much about Chinese culture for his work on The Blue Lotus. Later, Zhang moved back to his homeland and Hergé lost contact with his friend after the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. Hergé felt Chang and Tintin must be reunited, just as he hoped to see his friend again some day.|$|E
5|$|Wright's {{adaptation}} {{failed to}} have the same cultural impact as the 1995 serial and has since attracted sharply-divided opinions. However, even three years after the release, Knightley was still associated with Elizabeth Bennet among a generation of young viewers who <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> the 1995 production. Given the varied opinions about the film, JASNA published an edited special issue of its online journal Persuasions On-Line in 2007 with the collaboration of nineteen Austen scholars from six countries; the intent was to foster discussion and stimulate scholarly analysis. JASNA had done this only once before, for the 1996 film Emma.|$|E
5|$|Defense {{testimony}} {{focused on}} the theory that Tim Farrar, angry at his father, had set fire to the home. Friends of Tim's testified that Tim had had a fascination with fire and that he had told friends that he knew how to make bombs. A neighbor testified that he had once caught Tim burning some grass in the neighbor's yard. A former nanny testified that she had heard Tim speak about wanting his father dead and planning to burn down the family's house, and had caught him multiple times setting or with the implements to set fires. On cross-examination, she admitted that she <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> Tim Farrar for years and agreed that she had not reported Tim's fascination with fire to his parents or the police when he had expressed it to her.|$|E
