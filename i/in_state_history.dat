Bevin responded with a web site tying Conway to President Barack Obama, who was very unpopular in Kentucky, saying that Conway would support environmental regulations that harm the coal industry and support the Affordable Care Act, which was also unpopular in the state, despite its nationally praised insurance exchange.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not making}} {{landfall}} on the United States, the hurricane caused widespread damage. Extensive precautionary measures were undertaken across the coast, particularly in New England. The heightened precautions were {{due in part}} to fears that effects from the storm would be similar to that of a devastating hurricane that struck the region two years prior. Most of the damage associated with the hurricane occurred in New Jersey, where the combination of moisture from the hurricane and a stationary front produced record rainfall, peaking at 24in (610mm) in the town of Ewan. This would make the storm the wettest <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>history.</b> The resultant floods damaged infrastructure, mostly to road networks. Damage in the state amounted to $4million. Farther north in New England, strong winds were reported, though damage remained minimal. Although the storm made two landfalls in Atlantic Canada, damage there too was minimal, and was limited to several boating incidents caused by strong waves. Overall, the hurricane caused seven fatalities.|$|E

5|$|During the 1894 {{legislative}} session, Brown advocated and won {{passage of}} several government efficiency measures, including {{a bill to}} transfer certain state governmental expenses to the counties, a bill to reform state printing contracts, and measures clarifying laws governing asylums and charitable institutions.

Measures advocated by Brown but not enacted by the Assembly included broadening the powers of the state railroad commission, establishing the offices of state bank inspector and superintendent of public printing, and reforming prison management, including separate detention of adolescent criminals. Brown also lobbied for the abolition of the state parole board; when the Assembly refused, Brown vowed to ignore the board's recommendations.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{retirement}} of Rocky Welton in 1999, former assistant coach Martin Segovia took over as the new head coach. In contrast to the 1990s, Garden City was unable to win a state championship throughout the 2000s, although the Buffaloes did produce three individual state titles and an All-American. Jason Nichols won individual state championships in 2000 and 2001 and sophomore Ryan Kromer won an individual state championship in 2002. In 2006, Beth Johnson was named a Second-Team All-American and in 2008, she was named as a First-Team All-American, the first girl {{to do so in}} school history. Also in 2008, Martin Segovia relinquished his role as head coach and former assistant Monte Moser took over as the new head coach. In 2010, the Buffaloes placed fourth in the state championship, while producing two individual state champions in Lane Greenlee and Joey Dozier. One year later, Anthony Calderon won an individual state championship. Following the 2012 season, Monte Moser retired and Carlos Prieto became the current head coach. In 2013, the Buffaloes won the state championship {{for the first time since}} 1999, and repeated in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Also in 2016, Michael Prieto won his fourth consecutive individual state title, the first 4-time individual state champion in school history and 33rd <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E
5|$|Reports of a {{potentially}} destructive hurricane near the United States Gulf Coast forced thousands of residents in low-lying areas to evacuate {{prior to the}} storm moving inland. Offshore, the hurricane generated rough seas and a strong storm surge, peaking at 6.4ft (1.95m) on {{the western edge of}} Lake Pontchartrain. The anomalously high tides flooded many of Louisiana's outlying islands, inundating resorts. Strong winds caused moderate infrastructural damage, primarily in Texas, though its impact was mainly to communication networks along the U.S. Gulf Coast which were disrupted by the winds. However, much of the property and crop damage wrought by the hurricane was due to the torrential rainfall it produced in low-lying areas, setting off record floods. Rainfall peaked at 37.5in (953mm) in Miller Island off Louisiana, making it the wettest tropical cyclone <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>history.</b> Nineteen official weather stations in both Texas and Louisiana observed record 24-hour rainfall totals for the month of August {{as a result of the}} slow-moving hurricane. Property, livestock, and crops – especially cotton, corn, and pecan crops – were heavily damaged. Entire ecosystems were also altered by the rainfall. Overall, the storm caused $10.75million in damages and seven fatalities.|$|E

5|$|Due to the storm's slow {{movement}} just offshore the Louisiana coast, {{the hurricane}} became the wettest tropical cyclone <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>history,</b> with numerous locations reporting record rainfall across the state. Of the state's ten highest official rainfall measurements associated with tropical cyclones, the two highest were measurements {{taken during the}} hurricane. Precipitation peaked at 37.5in (953mm) on Miller Island. For any given 20,000mi2 (50,000km/h2) area of Louisiana, the maximum rainfall averaged 12.1in (307.3mm). Thirteen official weather stations in the state reported monthly 24-hour rainfall total records. The highest of these was in Crowley, where 19.76in (501.9mm) of precipitation fell on August9; the station would record 33.71in (856.2mm) of rain {{over the course of}} the storm. The torrential rainfall submerged the city under 2ft (0.6m) of floodwater. In Cameron, the storm dropped 21in (533mm) of rain was reported. In St. Landry Parish, bayous flowed over their banks, causing refugees to evacuate to Opelousas. In the Acadiana region of southern Louisiana, the resulting floods were considered worse than the floods that resulted from the Sauvé's Crevasse in 1927. There, whooping crane populations were severely impacted by the rainfall, and only one was known to be alive by 1947. The floods inundated roughly 2,000,000acres (800,000hectares) of land in Louisiana. Much of the lowland areas remained underwater until October1940. As a result, cotton and corn crops experienced significant losses, as well as pecans. Livestock also saw large losses. Impassable areas caused by rising floodwaters prevented firefighters from extinguishing a fire which burned down much of the Shell Oil Company's offices and supply warehouses in the town of Iowa. Across the state, the hurricane caused $9million in damages, though only six fatalities resulted, relatively less than most storms of similar scale. The low death count was attributed to large evacuation procedures which underwent prior to the storm, as well as guidance provided from the newly opened Weather Bureau east of Lake Charles.|$|E
5|$|On September1, the Venezuelan tanker Acosta relayed an SOS signal while {{near the}} {{hurricane}} 200mi (320km) {{southeast of the}} Frying Pan Shoals. United States Coast Guard stations in Norfolk, Virginia and Morehead City, North Carolina dispatched cutters to aid the ship. Off of the East Coast, {{an offshoot of the}} hurricane resulted in the drownings of two people. In the Mid-Atlantic states, the passing hurricane's outflow interacted with a cold front that had become quasi-stationary over the area. The cyclone's flow pattern enhanced the moisture environment over the region, resulting in locally heavy rainfall, particularly in New Jersey, where precipitation peaked at 24in (610mm) in Ewan in a nine-hour period on September1. This would make the hurricane the wettest tropical cyclone <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>history.</b> Most of the rain was in western portions of the state, however, with minimal rainfall at the coast. The floods caused small rivers to overflow, breaching dams. An overflowed creek inundated parts of Lumberton Township, rendering 2,000people homeless. Rail service between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and areas of southern New Jersey was suspended as a result of washed out tracks. Resulting damage to infrastructure totaled $4,000,000in the southwestern quarter of New Jersey alone. Damage to roads in Burlington County amounted to $2,500,000. In Camden County, damage was estimated at $1million. Four fatalities were reported {{as a result of the}} floods. In Delaware, rainfall was comparatively less. However, rough seas generated by the hurricane offshore caused $50,000 in damages and one death. Further north, strong gusts were reported across New England. Winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) were recorded by a weather station in Nantucket. Peak winds in Massachusetts were estimated at 65 mph (100 km/h). In Eastport, Maine, winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) were reported.|$|E
