The delay from the crowd gathering on the field ran the game <b>into</b> <b>darkness.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following the {{relaunch}} of Star Trek in 2009 {{with a new}} cast playing those roles seen in The Original Series, {{there was}} commentary online {{about the lack of}} female characters and whether Rand might be appearing in future installments. While the sequel, Star Trek <b>Into</b> <b>Darkness,</b> was in production, Rand was one of five characters who was stated not to be appearing in the film by writer Roberto Orci.

5|$|Overall, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters was Paramount's fourth highest-grossing film of 2013, {{following}} new graphic {{novel and}} franchise entries: World War Z, Star Trek <b>Into</b> <b>Darkness,</b> and , respectively. It is estimated that, following published production costs, marketing and advertising fees, {{and the percentage}} of overseas revenue that was lost by the domestic studio, similar fantasy reboots such as Snow White and the Huntsman, Mirror, Mirror, Jack the Giant Slayer, , and I, Frankenstein fail to match the total studio winnings for Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, which makes {{it one of the most}} financially successful films of the fantasy-reboot genre, despite having the smallest estimated budget and lowest Metascore of the recent entries.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} between April 16, 1991 and September 27, 1991, using a mix of fixed sets and on-location footage. The production suffered {{from a lack of}} available set space because of shortages; the Starfleet Headquarters set was actually built a few blocks away from Paramount Pictures at the Hollywood Presbyterian Church. Meyer copied a technique used during filming of Citizen Kane, where the filmmakers let the set fall <b>into</b> <b>darkness</b> to save money on construction. The film was shot in Super 35 instead of anamorphic format, because of the former's greater flexibility in framing and lens selection, larger depth of field, and faster lenses.|$|E
