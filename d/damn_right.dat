500|$|The Sandman {{became a}} cult success for DC Comics and {{attracted}} an audience {{unlike that of}} mainstream comics: much of the readership was female, many were in their twenties, and many read no other comics at all. Comics historian Les Daniels called Gaiman's work [...] "astonishing" [...] and noted that The Sandman was [...] "a mixture of fantasy, horror, and ironic humor such as comic books had never seen before." [...] DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that [...] "The Sandman became the first extraordinary success {{as a series of}} graphic novel collections, reaching out and converting new readers to the medium, particularly young women on college campuses, and making Gaiman himself into an iconic cultural figure." [...] Gaiman had a finite run in mind for the series, and it concluded with issue No. 75. Gaiman said in 1996, [...] "Could I do another five issues of Sandman? Well, <b>damn</b> <b>right.</b> And would I {{be able to look at}} myself in the mirror happily? No. Is it time to stop because I've reached the end, yes, and I think I'd rather leave while I'm in love." [...] The final issue, No. 75, was dated March 1996.|$|E

500|$|... was a {{critical}} and commercial success, and Paramount Pictures quickly prepared for a third Star Trek film. The Wrath of Khans director, Nicholas Meyer, would not return; he had disagreed with changes made to his film's ending without his consent. Upon seeing The Wrath of Khan, Leonard Nimoy became [...] "excited" [...] about playing Spock again. When asked by Paramount {{if he wanted to}} reprise the role for the third feature, Nimoy agreed and told them, [...] "You're <b>damned</b> <b>right,</b> I want to direct that picture!" [...] Studio chief Michael Eisner was reluctant to hire Nimoy because he mistakenly believed that the actor hated Star Trek and had demanded in his contract that Spock be killed. Nimoy was given the job after he persuaded Eisner that this was not the case. Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's first reaction to the news was that producer Harve Bennett had [...] "hired a director you can't fire".|$|R

6000|$|Negotiations {{had been}} going on for some months, and they {{continued}} in various stages for some months longer, for a coalition between the two great parties of the State. Burke was persistently anxious that Fox should join Pitt's Government. Pitt always admitted the importance of Fox's abilities in the difficult affairs which lay before the ministry, and declared that he had no sort of personal animosity to Fox, but rather a personal good-will and good-liking. Fox himself said of a coalition, [...] "It is so <b>damned</b> <b>right,</b> to be sure, that I cannot help thinking it must be." [...] But the difficulties were insuperable. The more rapidly the Government drifted in Burke's direction, the more impossible was it for a man of Fox's political sympathies and convictions to have any dealings with a cabinet committed to a policy of irrational panic, to be carried out by a costly war abroad and cruel repression at home. [...] "What a very wretched man!" [...] was Burke's angry exclamation one day, when it became certain that Fox meant to stand by the old flag of freedom and generous common sense.|$|R

5000|$|The detractors {{were many}} due to Georgie's habit of {{disregarding}} her customer's safety. Her business had {{the distinction of}} having the first rafting commercial fatality, Mae Hansen, aged 64, and the first injured person to be evacuated by helicopter from the Grand Canyon, Vernon Read, who suffered severe skull and spinal fractures. River guide John Davenport, who watched as Georgie intentionally launched her boat into a dangerous position on the river, reported [...] "She was pretty far left in her entry. It {{looked like she was}} going to run left. But then I saw her stand up and look toward the Ledge Hole. As soon as she saw she was going to miss it, she fired up her motor and powered over {{to the center of the}} river. She was too late to reach the Ledge Hole and also straighten out. So she entered the Ledge Hole at a 45-degree angle. It was the worst example of gross incompetence I have ever seen." [...] Customer Norine Abrams died as a result of these actions. When National Park Service Ranger Kim Crumbo arrived to transport Ms. Crumbo's body out, Georgie became frustrated because the transportation was taking too long. She had new customers arriving and she didn't want them to see the body bag. She so annoyed the ranger (who had injured his back moving the body) that [...] "Ranger Crumbo said 'Georgie, you just killed this woman, now you want me to hurry up and hide the body?' Georgie stared Crumbo in the eye and said, 'You're <b>damned</b> <b>right</b> I do. Now get her out of sight before you scare these new people.'"

Don't try to use your own intelligence, because you haven't any. I'm not blaming you for it. It wasn't your fault that your nurses dropped you on your heads when you were babies. But it handicaps you when you try to think." ...|$|R

I wanted to study drawing, {{and he had a}} cousin that'd {{made a lot of money}} tailoring out in Dakota, and he said tailoring was a lot like drawing, so he sent me down to a punk hole called Curlew, to work in a tailor shop. Up to that time I'd only had three months' schooling a year--walked to school two miles, through snow up to my knees--and Dad never would stand for my having a single book except schoolbooks.|$|R
50|$|The allegory {{carries a}} strong social {{message of the}} value of the stable republican {{government}} of Siena. It combines elements of secular life with references to the importance of religion in the city at the time. The figure of Justice resembles the figure of Mary, Queen of Heaven, the patron saint of Siena, on a throne. The Judge reflects the tradition in the Christian Last Judgment to have God or Christ judging the saved on the left; the <b>damned</b> on the <b>right.</b> While classified as medieval or proto (pre)-renaissance art, these paintings show a transition in thought and an evolution in theme from earlier religious art.|$|R
