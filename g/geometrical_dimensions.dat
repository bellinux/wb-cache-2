50|$|MSOT {{has been}} {{described}} as a 6-dimensional (6-parametric) method, in which the three <b>geometrical</b> <b>dimensions</b> (x, y, z) are complemented by time, illumination wavelengths and band of ultrasound frequencies detected. MSOT can measure over time, allowing longitudinal studies of dynamic processes. Illumination wavelengths in MSOT can cover the entire spectrum from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR). The wavelength defines the photoabsorbers that can be seen and the imaging depth. High-energy ion beams and energy in the radiofrequency range have also been used. The choice of ultrasound frequency band defines resolution and overall size range of the objects that can be resolved. This choice of frequency band dictates whether the imaging will be in the macroscopic regime, involving resolution of 100-500 microns and penetration depth >10 mm, or mesoscopic range, involving resolution of 1-50 microns and penetration depth <10 mm.6 Microscopic resolution is also possible using multi-spectral optoacoustics. Like optical microscopy, they use focused light to form images and offers fundamentally the same capabilities (submicrometer resolution, <1mm penetration depth).|$|E
