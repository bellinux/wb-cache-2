500|$|At first <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to work on}} one song; {{that was}} the {{original}} plan. Let's try to work on one song and {{take it from there}} -- not spend too much time thinking about the legend, and do something that just makes sense. [...] We did one song and another song, and we were having fun making music. And actually it was a very privileged time. She wasn't under any kind of pressure, she had time to spend on it; {{it was the only thing}} she had to work on.|$|E

2500|$|Dershowitz, in {{his book}} Taking the Stand, recounts that von Bülow had a dinner party after he {{was found not guilty}} at his trial. Dershowitz told him that he would not attend if it was a [...] "victory party", and von Bülow assured him that it was only a dinner for [...] "several {{interesting}} friends". Norman Mailer attended the dinner where, among other things, Dershowitz explained why the evidence pointed to von Bulow's innocence. As Dershowitz recounted, Mailer grabbed his wife's arm and said: [...] "Let's get out here. I think this guy is innocent. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to be having dinner with a man who actually tried to kill his wife. This is boring." ...|$|E

6000|$|Ladue, a big, hulking, {{pock-marked}} half-breed, {{began to}} grin. [...] "I was a-scared; <b>I</b> sure <b>was.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>was</b> all goin' to hang. Old Bill Yarpe was out for game." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! dear, my lord,' said Mistress Pauncefort, {{blushing}} and simpering. 'Well to be sure, {{how your}} lordship has surprised us all! <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{never going to}} see you again!' ...|$|R
60|$|No sooner {{said than}} done. We jumped again into our cab and started. As we drove back, Mr. Hayes asked me where <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{most likely to}} find it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to live {{in regular}} camping style!" [...] she declared. [...] "This {{is as good as}} what we had at the hotel in Chicago, if not better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to fight}} the Genoese galleys. It {{does not seem to}} me that a week is wanted to do that. A day to go to Chioggia, a day to fight, and a day to return. What can you want more than that for?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{smiled at}} the black gentleman, and said <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to have the {{carriage}} to ourselves; and he laughed pleasantly, and said that some people made such a fuss over a little thing. But even he grew strangely depressed after we had started, and so, when we reached Crewe, I {{asked him to come}} and have a drink. He accepted, and we forced our way into the buffet, where we yelled, and stamped, and waved our umbrellas for a quarter of an hour; and then a young lady came, and asked us if we wanted anything.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am sure, Jasper,' said Gillian, 'I don't see why {{it should}} spoil {{anything}} to make other people happy. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> told to make feasts not only for our own friends--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh dear!' sighed Fly, {{turning to}} Mysie as they rose from table, 'I am so sorry! It {{would have been}} so nice; and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> safe, as mamma had written herself!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Sir Rupert {{made his}} mouth look very wide by sucking in the corners. [...] "Incidentally," [...] he said, and added after a judicious pause: [...] "Sometimes ... <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> talking of making money." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have been}} at sea, man and boy, for forty years, and I never {{remember}} in these latitudes such a squall as that. For a few minutes I could scarcely see or breathe. The spray flew in sheets over us, and the wind roared so that you wouldn't have heard a sixty-eight-pounder ten yards off. At first <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> down bodily. It was lucky we had taken every stitch of canvas off her, for, as she spun round, {{the force of the}} wind against the masts and rigging all but capsized her. In five minutes the first burst was over, and we were running before it under our close-reefed foresail only. There was no occasion for us to stand by the halyards now, and we all gathered in the stern, and crouched down in the well. Although the sun had only gone down half an hour it was pitch-dark, except that the white foam round us gave a sort of dim light that made the sky look all the blacker. The sea got up in less time than it takes in telling, and we were soon obliged to hoist the foresail a bit higher to prevent the waves from coming in over the stern. For three hours we tore on before the gale, and then it lulled almost as suddenly as it had come on. There had scarcely been a word spoken between us during this time. I was half asleep in spite of the showers of spray. Jim Hackers, who was always smoking, puffed away steadily; Jabez was steering still, and the others were quite quiet. With the sudden lull we were all on our feet.|$|E

6000|$|... "O, John, {{it is so}} good to {{be really}} home! I have had an awful dream, dear. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> no longer in London, but in some horrible place where great beasts {{attacked}} us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have made}} a mess of it entirely, your honour," [...] he said, [...] "and have got a terrible bating. Sure <b>we</b> <b>were</b> lucky in getting here. Faith, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> caught when you were hailed." ...|$|R
