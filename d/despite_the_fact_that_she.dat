5|$|Repair work on Gneisenau was {{completed}} by 26 February 1942, and she was scheduled to deploy to Norway on 6 March. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was still in dry dock, her ammunition stores had been restocked and she was prepared for a short round of trials before her departure. On the night of 26–27 February, however, the British launched a heavy air raid on the ship. The ship {{was hit by a}} single bomb in her forecastle that penetrated the armored deck and exploded. Red-hot bomb fragments ignited propellant charges in the forward turret and caused a tremendous explosion. The turret was thrown off its mount and the entire bow section was burned out. The crew partially flooded the magazine to prevent a more catastrophic explosion. The blast killed 112 men and wounded 21 others.|$|E
5|$|Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladova, {{variously}} called Sonya and Sonechka, is {{the daughter}} of a drunkard named Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, whom Raskolnikov meets in a tavern {{at the beginning of the}} novel. She is often characterized as self-sacrificial, shy, and even innocent <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is compelled into prostitution to help her family. She also, as Raskolnikov discerns, shares the same feelings of shame and alienation as he does and becomes the first person to whom Raskolnikov confesses his crime, and she supports him even though she was friends with one of the victims (Lizaveta). Throughout the novel, Sonya is an important source of moral strength and rehabilitation for Raskolnikov, and in some interpretations, even considered a Christ-like figure. She is forced to prostitute herself to provide for her family, leading some critics to make comparisons with Mary Magdalene.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Italy had declined to join its Triple Alliance partners—Germany and Austria-Hungary—in declaring war against the Entente Powers, and opted to remain neutral. Pressure from the United Kingdom and France swayed Italy to sign the secret 1915 Treaty of London on 26 April, in which Italy promised to leave the Triple Alliance and declare war against its former allies within a month in return for territorial gains {{after the end of}} the war. Because Italy initially declared war only on Austria-Hungary, Germany and Italy were not officially at war. As a consequence, German submarines operating in the Adriatic and the Mediterranean were all assigned Austrian numbers and flew the flag of Austria-Hungary when making attacks on Italian vessels; UB-14 was assigned the designation of U-26 and entered onto the rolls of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> remained completely under German control. According to historian Lawrence Sondhaus, this dual numbering system reflected the close submarine cooperation between the two countries and still makes it difficult to distinguish between submarines of the two navies.|$|E

50|$|The {{problem is}} whether to {{quantify}} the whole ring as a single species (<b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> not all individuals can interbreed) or to classify each population as a distinct species (<b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it can interbreed with its near neighbours). Ring species illustrate that the species concept is not as clear-cut as it is often thought to be.|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1944, {{the ship}} was due for another overhaul; work was to have lasted for three months. The Soviet Army had {{advanced}} so far, however, {{that it was necessary}} to move the ship farther away from the front, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had only one working turbine. On 29 January 1945, the ship left Gotenhafen, arriving in Kiel on 2 February. She entered the Germaniawerft shipyard for refitting. On 3 May, RAF bombers attacked the harbor and severely damaged the ship. Her crew scuttled the wrecked ship at her moorings at 04:25 on 3 May. In July 1945, {{after the end of the}} war, Admiral Hipper was raised and towed to Heikendorfer Bay and subsequently broken up for scrap in 1948–1952. Her bell was on display at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. The bell has since been returned to Germany and is on display at the Laboe Naval Memorial.|$|E
5|$|Just before junior prom, Jesse returns, having flunked out of UCLA, and Rachel invites him to {{the prom}} with her, Sam and Mercedes (Amber Riley). Jesse and Finn are {{kicked out of the}} prom when Finn picks a fight with Jesse over his attentions to Rachel on the dance floor, which {{effectively}} ends Finn and Quinn's campaign for prom king and queen. Finn ultimately breaks up with Quinn when he realizes he has a deeper connection with Rachel, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> and Jesse seem to be a couple again. At Nationals, as the New Directions are about to go on stage, Finn begs Rachel to get back together with him, but though she professes her love, she refuses, still torn between her love for New York and Broadway and her love for him. At the end of their duet—"Pretending", written by Finn—an enthusiastic audience falls silent when Rachel and Finn share an overlong, unscripted kiss; the glee club comes in twelfth. Back in Ohio, Finn reminds Rachel that she has a year until graduation and any move to New York; he kisses her, and their relationship resumes.|$|E
5|$|More than 99percent of Benet {{graduates}} go to college; roughly 1percent {{serve in}} the military. Benet students were implicated in the University of Illinois clout scandal, in which some applicants were given preferential admission to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) despite having sub-par qualifications. The Chicago Tribune, investigating the scandal, reported {{that a majority of}} students who were admitted to UIUC through political favors came from elite, affluent high schools such as Benet, where families were politically connected with elected officials and university trustees. An email between admissions officers revealed that a female Benet student was admitted to the university's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had ranked lower than 27 of her classmates who were put on a waiting list or denied admission. Between 2005 and 2009, thirteen applicants from Benet were alleged to have had political connections; eight of them were admitted to UIUC.|$|E

5|$|Nauendorf {{continued}} his raids, the soldiers foraged {{for food and}} dug up the local potato crop, and Joseph and Frederick glared at one another by Königgrätz. Maria Theresa had sent Kaunitz on a secret mission to Berlin to offer a truce. In a second trip, she offered a settlement, and finally wrote to Catherine in Russia to ask for assistance. When Joseph discovered his mother's maneuvering behind his back, he furiously offered to resign. His mother enlisted the assistance she needed. Catherine offered to mediate the dispute; if her assistance was unacceptable, {{she was willing to}} send fifty thousand troops to augment the Prussian force, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> disliked Frederick and her alliance with him was strictly defensive. Frederick withdrew portions of his force in mid-September. In October, Joseph withdrew most of his army to the Bohemian border and Frederick withdrew his remaining troops into Prussia. Two small forces of hussars and dragoons remained in Bohemia to provide a winter cordon; these forces allowed Joseph and Frederick {{to keep an eye on}} each other while their diplomats negotiated at Teschen.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{then went}} into drydock for an overhaul, before {{returning}} to Cuban waters for maneuvers with the fleet. She arrived there on 25 February 1915. The {{rest of the year}} was spent with training exercises with the Atlantic Fleet. Another overhaul, at the Boston Navy Yard, from 20 January to January 1916. On 27 January, Georgia was decommissioned temporarily. The same day as the United States' declaration of war against Germany on 6 April 1917, the ship was reactivated for service during World War I. She was assigned to the 3rd Division, Battleship Force, based in the York River, Virginia. She spent most of the war training gunners for the rapidly expanding wartime Navy and conducting tactical training exercises. During this period, the ship frequently had more than a thousand men aboard the ship, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had sleeping accommodations for only 750. The ship's commander at the time, Captain Sumner Kittelle, raised concerns about the over-crowded conditions aboard the ship.|$|E
5|$|When Victoria {{ascended the}} throne in 1837, Lehzen enjoyed a {{prominent}} {{position at the}} coronation, and remained at court. Lehzen was installed at Buckingham Palace {{as a sort of}} unofficial private secretary, served as chief liaison for the royal residences, and carried the household keys as a sign of her position; her signature was required for all payments of tradesmen's bills, for instance. At this point, it seems that Lehzen had totally replaced Victoria's mother both in terms of influence and affection; Lehzen's apartments adjoined the queen's, while the Duchess of Kent was installed in a suite of rooms far removed from Victoria's. For {{the first few years of}} Victoria's reign, especially before her marriage to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840, Lehzen had a very strong influence on the queen's outlook on both politics and personal matters, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not overtly involve herself in state affairs. Even after the queen's marriage, Lehzen retained the private doorway into the royal bedroom, a source of displeasure for Albert.|$|E
