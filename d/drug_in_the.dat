5|$|Because {{of similar}} and {{additive}} effects, divers should avoid sedating medications and drugs, such as marijuana and alcohol before any dive. A hangover, {{combined with the}} reduced physical capacity that goes with it, makes nitrogen narcosis more likely. Experts recommend total abstinence from alcohol for at least 12 hours before diving, and longer for other drugs. Abstinence time needed for marijuana is unknown, but owing to the much longer half-life of the active agent of this <b>drug</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body, {{it is likely to}} be longer than for alcohol.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the summer}} of 2009 and March 2010, the use of {{mephedrone}} grew rapidly in the UK, with it becoming readily available at music festivals, head shops and on the internet. A survey of Mixmag readers in 2009, found {{it was the fourth}} most popular street <b>drug</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, behind cannabis, cocaine, and ecstasy. The drug was used by a diverse range of social groups. Whilst the evidence was anecdotal, researchers, charity workers, teachers and users reported widespread and increasing use of the drug in 2009. The drug's rapid growth in popularity was believed to be related to both its availability and legality.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine as a {{manufactured}} {{medication is}} sold under the trade names Intropin, Dopastat, and Revimine, among others. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is most commonly used as a stimulant <b>drug</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment of severe low blood pressure, slow heart rate, and cardiac arrest. It is especially important in treating these in newborn infants. It is given intravenously. Since the half-life of dopamine in plasma is very short—approximately one minute in adults, two minutes in newborn infants and up to five minutes in preterm infants—it is usually given in a continuous intravenous drip rather than a single injection.|$|E

Black follows up on this, and investigates Nesbitt's pharmacy. Nesbitt is not working at the time, but Black realizes he must be the killer. He interviews Nesbitt's wife (Barbara Howard), finding {{that they have not}} had sex in eighteen years of marriage—however, Nesbitt has recently become interested in trying again.|$|E

5|$|Twenty {{percent of}} modern {{pharmaceuticals}} contain fluorine. One of these, the cholesterol-reducer atorvastatin (Lipitor), made more revenue {{than any other}} drug until it became generic in 2011. The combination asthma prescription Seretide, a top-ten revenue <b>drug</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-2000s, contains two active ingredients, one of which – fluticasone – is fluorinated. Many drugs are fluorinated to delay inactivation and lengthen dosage periods because the carbon–fluorine bond is very stable. Fluorination also increases lipophilicity because the bond is more hydrophobic than the carbon–hydrogen bond, and this often helps in cell membrane penetration and hence bioavailability.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam {{was first}} {{released}} by Upjohn (now {{a part of}} Pfizer) in 1981. The first approved use was of panic disorder, and within two years of its original marketing, Xanax became a blockbuster <b>drug</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US. As of 2010, alprazolam is the most prescribed and the most misused benzodiazepine in the US. The potential for misuse among those taking it for medical reasons is controversial, with some expert reviews stating that the risk is low and {{similar to that of}} other benzodiazepine drugs. Others state that there is a substantial risk of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users and that the high affinity binding, high potency, short elimination half-life, and rapid onset of action may increase the misuse potential of alprazolam. Compared to the large number of prescriptions, relatively few individuals increase their dose on their own initiative or engage in drug-seeking behavior. Alprazolam is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).|$|E
