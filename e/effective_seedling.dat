40|$|Abstract The aims were {{to examine}} the {{importance}} of regeneration by seeds, the influence of plant traits and disturbances, {{and the role of}} seed-seedling conflicts in regeneration and in the determination of vegetation structure. The study was carried out at in a subarctic alpine area (Kilpisjärvi 69 ° 01 'N 20 ° 50 E', Finland). Seed bank and seedling densities were high in many plant communities (ranges 99 - 1109 viable seeds/m 2 and 0. 2 - 227 seedlings/m 2, respectively). <b>Effective</b> <b>seedling</b> recruitment is reflected in vegetation as a high proportion of plants with poor or no vegetative reproduction ability. This development may take place in meadows and snowbeds where herbs (e. g. Gnaphalium supinum, Sibbaldia procumbens, Veronica alpina and Viola biflora) are abundant. On the other hand, the low proportion of these plants in heath vegetation reflects ineffective seedling recruitment. Floristic similarities between the consecutive phases in the regeneration pathway may be low despite <b>effective</b> <b>seedling</b> recruitment. Clonality, large and small seed sizes and appendaged diaspores limit the movement of species from phase to phase. Generally, disturbances facilitate effective regeneration by seeds. Grazing promotes species with large seed banks and is therefore one reason for high seed bank densities. Freezing and melting processes negate a negative influence of altitude on seed bank densities in the phase of seedlings. However, if disturbances are severe and continuous and the soil is compact, unstable or dry, disturbances are not beneficial. The same is true if there is a shift in the species composition of seedlings from gaps to closed vegetation. This phenomenon occurred in a rich meadow. Seed-seedling conflicts limit regeneration by seeds in low-herb snowbeds and Ranunculus glacialis-Gymnomitrion snowbeds. Vegetative reproduction and infrequent pulses of seedling recruitment negate an influence of short-term seedling recruitment on the spatial structure of vegetation. Extreme conditions, such as low temperatures, instability of the soil and late snowmelt modify the influence of factors that are important in more moderate conditions. To conclude, all transitions limit regeneration by seeds. However, favourable conditions (e. g. moist conditions in a meadow) partly eliminate the obstacles against seedling emergence. Regeneration by seeds therefore has a major impact on the dynamics and structure of vegetation. In heath vegetation, where bare soils are dry and the moss cover is thick, large seed banks and seed rains do not guarantee <b>effective</b> <b>seedling</b> recruitment. The regeneration process is reduced in the early phases, and plants that reproduce primarily by seeds have a minor role in vegetation. The accumulation of seed banks is effective in these circumstances...|$|E

40|$|While the {{majority}} of peatlands and wetlands are concentrated in the boreal zone, millions of ha of these ecosystems are also found in subantarctic areas of the southern hemisphere. In spite of the extensive area of bogs in the southern cone of South America, there have been very few studies on structure and dynamics of conifer bog forests in this regían, although {{many of them have}} been greatly changed by humans. Southern bog forests dominated by the conifer Pilgerodendron uviferum in Northern Patagonia are a typical case of an ecosystem with low resilience to disturbance by fire, which kills most trees and seeds. These forests, which have been burned to a large extent, cover an area of almost 1 million ha (6. 8 % of Chilean native forests). The aim of this doctoral thesis was to study fire-disturbed and undisturbed old-growth P. uviferum bog forests in North Patagonia in arder to develop the scientific ecological basis for conservation and restoration strategies. Therefore the work focussed on three important aspects of restoration: a) understanding the processes occurring in undisturbed old-growth forests, b) analysing the natural rate of recovery of fire-disturbed forests, ande) exploring sorne options for restoration. Using a multi-scaled approach, this study started analysing diameter and age structure, foliar and soil nutrient levels and the light environment in old-growth and fire-disturbed P. uviferum stands on Ch iloé lsland (43 º 5) in North Patagonia. Secondly, the seed dissemination potential and <b>effective</b> <b>seedling</b> recruitment distance from seed trees of the species were quantified, the suitability of substrates for the germination of P. uviferum seedlings was assessed, and the spatial distribution of seed trees of the species at the landscape level was analyzed. Finally, restoration plantings were established in disturbed upland and bog forests, to evaluate growth and mortality as well as performance (foliar nutrients and photosynthesis) of P. uviferum seedlings in relation to different site conditions characterized by variations in microtopography and canopy cover. According to the findings of this doctoral thesis, longevity (> 880 years), extremely slow growth ( 880 years),extremely slow growth (< 1 mm diameter per year) and tolerance to shade and stressare the main mechanisms of P. uviferum to persist in an extreme environment shapedby low nutrient availability and frequently waterlogged conditions. Therefore, in contrast to propositions made in previous studies, old-growth P. uviferum forests are not a transitional phase in forest succession and may be maintained in the landscape for many centuries or millennia. However, although extremely stress-tolerant, thespecies is very sensitive to fire and recovery from this type of disturbance is very slow. Seventy years after high-severity fires in the study area, seed trees were extremely infrequent at the landscape level (0. 3 trees/ha) and were aggregated at scales up to 30 m. Seed dissemination potential and <b>effective</b> <b>seedling</b> recruitment distance from individual P. uviferum seed trees was limited to 20 m, and seeds germinated best on moist Sphagnum or mineral soil substrate. This finding showed that high-severity firescan practically eliminate the species from parts of the landscape, where neither propagules nor seed trees survive. At the same time it points to the importance of biological legacies such as seed trees for the recovery of disturbed sites. Natural regeneration from seed trees can assist the recovery of P. uviferum populations following fire disturbance, but their effect is spatially limited at a landscape level. Therefore, restoration planting to complement existing seed trees may assist natural recovery of P. uviferum in disturbed bog forests and add to genetic diversity. To examine conditions for successful restoration planting, trials wereestablished in bogs and upland forest to assess whether manipulation of potentially limiting conditions may assist establishment of seedlings. Seedlings were planted on mounds or in depressions on bog sites to examine the effect drainage or beneath a canopy or in the open on upland sites to examine the effect of light. In bogs, there wasno significant effect of micro-topography on growth and survival of P. uviferumplantings. However, fluorescence measurements indicated lower stress in seedlings established on mounds. Seedlings in upland areas established beneath a nurse canopy had lower mortality and higher relative shoot growth, higher foliar nutrients, higherphotosynthetic light use efficiency and higher fluorescence values than those planted in the open. This indicates that seedlings of the slow growing P. uviferum may tolerate extremely wet conditions, yet suffer from stress when grown in the open. These results may improve restoration plantings of the species in disturbed bog forests. The mixed passive-active restoration approach, relying on naturallyregenerated parent trees complemented through low-density planting, which issuggested here, could be the most effective and efficient option to restare disturbed southern bog forests dominated by P. uviferum in North Patagonia. This low-cost approach may help managers of forest land to restare the species in the future. Furthermore, the multi-scale approach used in the present doctoral thesis studied the underlying ecological and physiological processes occurring in disturbed and undisturbed sites prior to planning a restoration program. In this context, it may be adopted for other ecosystems with low resilience and high degradation, where restoration is likely to be extremely expensive and the outcome uncertain. At the same time this study, which was inevitably limited in scope, showed that there are still verylarge knowledge gaps that should be filled to base management and restoration of these unique forests on a sound scientific basis...|$|E

However, detailed observations of partial resistance to leaf rust (Puccinia hordei) in barley (Hordeum vulgare) revealed small cultivar × isolate interactions, suggesting a minor-gene-for-minor-gene interaction model, similar to so-called `vertical¿ resistance. ¿ Three consistent quantitative trait loci (QTLs), labelled Rphq 2, Rphq 3 and Rphq 4, that were detected in the cross susceptible L 94 × partially resistant Vada have been incorporated into the L 94 background to obtain near-isogenic lines (NILs). Three isolates were used to map QTLs on seedlings of the L 94 × Vada population and to evaluate the effect of each QTL on adult plants of the respective NILs under field conditions. ¿ Rphq 2 had a strong effect in seedlings but almost no effect in adult plants, while Rphq 3 was <b>effective</b> in <b>seedlings</b> and in adult plants against all three isolates.

50|$|Because {{of their}} shorter life cycle, cotton thistle plants can be {{effectively}} treated with herbicides. All herbicide treatments {{should be applied}} at the rosette stage of the plant. Generally, herbicide applications would be in early spring or autumn. One of the primary difficulties in chemical control of cotton thistles is their ability to germinate nearly year round. From autumn to spring a range of plant sizes can be found which may result in variable success from chemical control. Herbicides are very <b>effective</b> on <b>seedlings</b> and young rosettes, but control becomes more variable with increasing plant age. Onopordum spp. seeds may persist for several years in the soil. Buried seed may persist for up to twenty years, and reinfestation is likely without yearly management. Therefore, several years of re-treatment may be necessary. Picloram, dicamba, 2,4-D, dicamba + 2,4,-D, and metsulfuron are effective for controlling Cotton Thistle. Clopyralid is more selective for controlling plants in the Asteraceae family, but will also injure or kill legumes.|$|R

The pathogen identified was confirmed biochemically and physiologically, hypersensitive reaction occurred in tobacco plants and pathogenicity tests were conducted. Significant variability was shown among the bacterial isolates. Isolates T 2, T 4 and T 5 were the most pathogenic isolates as expressed by the disease severity index. The highest severity index (57. 8 %) was observed by isolate T 5, followed by the two isolates T 4 (55. 3 %) and T 2 (43. 1 %) two weeks post inoculation.

Production issues, including collection, storage, and sowing of seeds, planting density, irrigation, nutrition, pest control, and lifting, have been commonly featured. Soil manage-ment, with emphasis on organic matter and nutrition, occupies a prominent position among the individual titles. It seems that nursery production knowledge and practice have been maintained at a relatively high level; one would be hard pressed to identify the year of pub-lication simply from a list of titles from any single pro-ceedings. This paper focuses on soil and nutrition in nursery seedling production. One of the most recent additions is the topic of exponential nutrient loading. This practice is used to induce luxury consumption, pro-ducing loaded seedlings that are better able to com-pete in the outplanting environment. Performance of outplanted seedlings, followed for as long as 6 years, suggests that nutrient loading is an <b>effective</b> nursery practice; <b>seedlings</b> effectively compete in their out...|$|R
40|$|Chlorophyll {{production}} {{involves the}} synthesis of photoreactive intermediates that, when in excess, are toxic due {{to the production of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS). A novel, activation-tagged barley (Hordeum vulgare) mutant is described that results from antisense suppression of a uroporphyrinogen III synthase (Uros) gene, the product of which catalyzes the sixth step in {{the synthesis of}} chlorophyll and heme. In homozygous mutant plants, uroporphyrin(ogen) I accumulates by spontaneous cyclization of hydroxyl methylbilane, the substrate of Uros. Accumulation of this tetrapyrrole intermediate results in photosensitive cell death due to the production of ROS. The efficiency of Uros gene suppression is developmentally regulated, being most <b>effective</b> in mature <b>seedling</b> leaves compared with newly emergent leaves. Reduced transcript accumulation of a number of nuclear-encoded photosynthesis genes occurs in the mutant, even under 3 % light conditions, consistent with a retrograde plastid-nuclear signaling mechanism arising from Uros gene suppression. A similar set of nuclear genes was repressed in wild-type barley following treatment with a singlet oxygen-generating herbicide, but not by a superoxide generating herbicide, suggesting that the retrograde signaling apparent in the mutant is specific to singlet oxygen...|$|R
40|$|Bean Stem Maggot (BSM) is {{a serious}} {{production}} problem in many African countries. In South Africa, the problem receives very little research and extension attention. This study set out to assess {{the magnitude of the}} BSM problem at Greytown during the 1995 season. Using a split-plot trial, split for insecticide or no insecticide, cultivar reaction to BSM was determined. The trial contained sixteen cultivar entries, including three local controls. Assessment of the potential threat of BSM to local production was made by comparisons across treatments using the local control variety Wartburg. Seed treatment with endosulfan was <b>effective</b> in eliminating <b>seedling</b> mortality due to BSM. In comparing the treated versus untreated plots of Wartburg, the plant population reduction attributable to BSM was 10. 9 percent. On average; treated Wartburg plots supported 0. 93 BSM larvae/pupae plant(- 1) compared to 3. 7 BSM larvae/pupae plant(- 1) in the untreated plots. The resultant yield loss due to the combined effect of plant stand reduction and the deleterious effects of the larvae and pupae amounted to 11. 39 percent. With subsistence agriculture in KwaZulu Natal (KZN), where low fertility and late plantings are the norm, the effects of BSM can be expected to be more severe still. The findings of this study justify the call for more extension and research resources to be allocated to the BSM problem...|$|R
40|$|Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum (Huber ex Ducke) occurs {{naturally}} in the Brazilian Amazon. Currently, {{it is being}} planted extensively because of its fast growth and excellent use in forestry. Consequently, there is great interest in new strategies to increase wood production. The interaction between soil microorganisms and plants, specifically in the roots, provides essential nutrients for plant growth. These interactions can have growth-promoting effects. In this way, this study assessed {{the effect of the}} inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) on growth of S. parahyba var. amazonicum under field conditions. We used two native species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Claroideoglomus etunicatum (Ce) and Acaulospora sp. (Ac); two native strains of Rhizobium sp. (Rh 1 and Rh 2); and a non-native strain of Burkholderia sp. Different combinations of microorganisms were supplemented with chemical fertilizers (doses D 1 and D 2) in two planting methods, seed sowing and seedling planting. In seed sowing, the results showed that treatments with Ce/Rh 1 /Fertilizer D 2 and Ac/No PGPR/Fertilizer D 2 increased wood yield. In seedling planting, two combinations (Ac/Rh 2 /Fertilizer D 1 and Ac/Rh 1 /Fertilizer D 1) were more <b>effective</b> in increasing <b>seedling</b> growth. In these experiments, inoculation with AMF and PGPR increased wood yield by about 20 % compared to the application of fertilizer alone...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} correlations between growth {{variables and the}} Dickson quality index in seedlings of Eucalyptus grandis and Pinus elliottii var. elliottii. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse and the following variables were observed: stem base diameter, shoot height, number of leaves, leaf dry matter, stem base dry matter, root dry matter, shoot dry matter, total dry matter, ratio of shoot dry matter to root dry matter and ratio of shoot height to stem base diameter in E. grandis 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120 days after seedling emergence, and in P. elliottii 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150 and 175 days after seedling emergence. Using Pearson correlation and also path and regression analyses, correlations were analyzed between observed variables according to day after emergence and the Dickson quality index. Stem base diameter {{was found to have}} stronger correlation with days after emergence in comparison to shoot height, in both species. Root dry matter was found to have stronger correlation with the Dickson quality index. Stem base diameter was the most suitable parameter to indicate seedling quality due to its higher correlation level with the Dickson quality index. Shoot height was only <b>effective</b> to indicate <b>seedling</b> quality if analyzed together with stem base diameter. Variables relating to dry matter showed the highest correlations with the Dickson quality index (DQI), followed by stem base diameter. Conversely, number of leaves showed the poorest correlations with DQI, followed by seedling height...|$|R
40|$|Waterlogging {{tolerance}} {{is typically}} evaluated {{at a specific}} development stage, with an implicit assumption that differences in waterlogging tolerance expressed in these systems will result in improved yield performance in fields. It is necessary to examine these criteria in fields. In the present study, three experiments were conducted to screen waterlogging tolerance in 25 rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) varieties at different developmental stages, such as seedling establishment stage and seedling stage at controlled environment, and maturity stage in the fields. The assessments for physiological parameters at three growth stages suggest that there were difference of waterlogging tolerance at all the development stages, providing an important basis for further development of breeding more tolerant materials. The results indicated that flash waterlogging restricts plant growth and growth is still restored after removal of the stress. Correlation analysis between waterlogging tolerance coefficient (WTC) of yield and other traits revealed that there was consistency in waterlogging tolerance of the genotypes until maturity, and good tolerance at seedling establishment stage and seedling stage can guarantee tolerance in later stages. The waterlogging-tolerant plants could be selected using some specific traits at any stage, and selections would be more <b>effective</b> at the <b>seedling</b> establishment stage. Thus, our study provides a method for screening waterlogging tolerance, which would enable the suitable basis for initial selection {{of a large number}} of germplasm or breeding populations for waterlogging tolerance and help for verifying their potential utility in crop-improvement...|$|R
40|$|Salt {{tolerant}} bacteria {{were used}} to assess their potential for stimulating the growth of Triticum aestivum var. Inqlab 91. Certified seeds of Triticum aestivum var. Inqlab 91 were inoculated with monocultures (ST- 1, ST- 2, ST- 3, ST- 4, rhizosphere bacteria; HT- 1, HT- 2, HT- 3, histoplane bacteria) and different combinations of mixed cultures of bacteria. Inoculated and non-inoculated seeds were germinated and grown under NaCl stress (0, 100 mM NaCl) for 10 days. After that growth measurements (length and weight parameters) were taken and Na + /K + contents, soluble protein content, auxin content, and enzyme activities (peroxidase and acid phosphatase) were determined. Generally, with the application of NaCl, reduction in germination and growth parameters, whereas increase in Na + / K + contents, auxins content, soluble protein content as well as enzymes activities were observed. Bacterial inoculations stimulated germination and growth, over non-inoculated respective treatments, especially under saline conditions. Mixed culture inoculation with rhizosphere bacteria (some combinations) and histoplane bacteria was more <b>effective</b> in stimulating <b>seedling</b> growth than monoculture inoculations at 100 mM NaCl. Bacterial inoculations also enhanced fresh weight per seedling, auxin, soluble protein and K + contents of seedlings. Whereas decreases in dry weight accumulation, Na + content and activity of enzymes, at 100 mM NaCl with bacterial inoculations were recorded. From these results improved growth of seedlings could be related with increased auxin content but decreased dry weight increment, Na + content and enzyme activities...|$|R
40|$|Partial {{resistance}} {{quantitative trait}} loci (QTLs) Rphq 11 and rphq 16 against Puccinia hordei isolate 1. 2. 1 were previously mapped in seedlings of the mapping populations Steptoe/Morex and Oregon Wolfe Barleys, respectively. In this study, QTL mapping was performed at adult plant {{stage for the}} two mapping populations challenged with the same rust isolate. The results suggest that Rphq 11 and rphq 16 are <b>effective</b> only at <b>seedling</b> stage, and not at adult plant stage. The cloning of several genes responsible for partial resistance of barley to P. hordei will allow elucidation of the molecular basis {{of this type of}} plant defence. A map-based cloning approach requires to fine-map the QTL in a narrow genetic window. In this study, Rphq 11 and rphq 16 were fine-mapped using an approach aiming at speeding up the development of plant material and simplifying its evaluation. The plant materials for fine-mapping were identified from early plant materials developed to produce QTL-NILs. The material was first selected to carry the targeted QTL in heterozygous condition and susceptibility alleles at other resistance QTLs in homozygous condition. This strategy took four to five generations to obtain fixed QTL recombinants (i. e., homozygous resistant at the Rphq 11 or rphq 16 QTL alleles, homozygous susceptible at the non-targeted QTL alleles). In less than 2 years, Rphq 11 was fine-mapped into a 0. 2 -cM genetic interval and a 1. 4 -cM genetic interval for rphq 16. The strongest candidate gene for Rphq 11 is a phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase. Thus far, no candidate gene was identified for rphq 16. </p...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{relationship}} involving arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and functional groups of plants that characterize different phases of tropical succession. We appraised the AM infection intensity of root cortex and spore density in the soil in sites over tropical successional gradients (grassland, secondary forest and mature forest) for several years in Araucaria,Atlantic and Pantanal ecosystems in Brazil. The intensity ofAMinfection decreasedwith advancing successional stages in all ecosystems and it was around 60 ? 80 % in early stages of succession, 37 ? 56 % in secondary forests and 19 ? 29 % in mature forests. Similarly, the AM spore number also decreased with advancing succession and was the highest in early stages (73 ? 123 g? 1), intermediate in secondary forests (32 ? 54 g? 1) and lowest in the mature forests (10 ? 23 g? 1). To verify whether such reductions influenced the potential of AM inoculum in soil, seedlings of Heliocarpus popayanensis (Malvaceae) were grown as test plants in soils obtained from five grasslands, five young secondary forests, and five mature forests in the Atlantic ecosystem. The soil inocula from the grasslands and secondary forests were 7. 6 and 5. 7 times more <b>effective</b> in stimulating <b>seedling</b> growth than inocula from the mature forests, respectively. Our results show that plant species in grasslands and young secondary forests stimulate the multiplication of AM fungi, leading to a higher potential of the AM inoculum. In later-successional stages, plant investment in AM fungi decreases and the potential of the AM inoculum is also reduced. 201...|$|R
40|$|This study {{dealt with}} a {{restoration}} project conducted at South-East New Territories Landfill in Hong Kong, in order to screen suitable tree and shrub species (both native and pioneer species) for revegetation. For engineered landfills, landfill gas migration and leachate contamination to the topsoil are rarely problematic, {{but the lack of}} nutrients and moisture and poor physical soil conditions may jeopardize potential woodland establishment. The growth performance of 25 woody plant species subjected to 12 different soil amelioration and seedlings planting methods was compared. The results showed that the general performance (mortality rate, apical height, crown diameter and basal diameter) of pioneer species (notably Acacia species) was much better than that of native species in all blocks of woodland mix and scrub mix. The notch planting method was <b>effective</b> in helping <b>seedling</b> roots to have better contact with soil for water uptake, which subsequently increased the survival rates of seedlings, leading to a better tree coverage. Soil ameliorations (horticultural soil with fertilizer and horse and pig manure) generally increased the seedling survival rate and improved plant growth. Tree coverage on all the plant trial blocks was mainly established by the three Acacia species. A planting distance of 1 m was recommended for woodland establishment, and such dense seedlings planting would achieve a better tree coverage under a shorter period of time (than the distance of 3 m). Difficulties in woodland establishment were discussed, and the strategies for achieving a better tree growth were recommended. Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technolog...|$|R
40|$|We {{explored}} {{the potential of}} biological control of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) seedling damping-off caused by Phytophthora megasperma f. sp. medicaginis by screening root-associated bacteria for disease suppression activity in a laboratory bioassay. A total of 700 bacterial strains were isolated from the roots of field-grown alfalfa plants by using Trypticase soy agar. A simple, rapid assay was developed to screen the bacteria for the ability to reduce the mortality of Iroquois alfalfa seedlings that were inoculated with P. megasperma f. sp. medicaginis zoospores. Two-day-old seedlings were planted in culture tubes containing moist vermiculite, and each tube was inoculated with a different bacterial culture. Sufficient P. megasperma f. sp. medicaginis zoospores were added to each tube to result in 100 % mortality of control seedlings. Of the 700 bacterial isolates tested, only 1, which was identified as Bacillus cereus and designated UW 85, reduced seedling mortality to 0 % in the initial screen and in two secondary screens. Both fully sporulated cultures containing predominantly released spores and sterile filtrates of these cultures of UW 85 were <b>effective</b> in protecting <b>seedlings</b> from damping-off; filtrates of cultures containing predominantly vegetative cells or endospores inside the parent cell had low biocontrol activity. Cultures grown in two semidefined media had significantly greater biocontrol activities than cultures grown in the complex tryptic soy medium. In a small-scale trial in a field infested with P. megasperma f. sp. medicaginis, coating seeds with UW 85 significantly increased the emergence of alfalfa. The results suggest that UW 85 may have potential as a biocontrol agent for alfalfa damping-off, thus providing an alternative to current disease control strategies...|$|R
