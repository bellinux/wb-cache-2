25|$|Sand {{filters are}} a {{variation}} of the infiltration trench principle and operate in a way similar to bioretention systems. Stormwater is passed through them for treatment prior to discharge to the downstream stormwater system. Sand filters are very useful in treating runoff from confined hard surfaces such as car parks and from heavily urbanised and built-up areas. They usually do not support vegetation owing to the filtration media (sand) not retaining sufficient moisture and because they are usually installed underground. The filter usually consists of a sedimentation chamber as pre-treatment device to remove litter, debris, gross pollutants and medium-sized sediments; a weir; followed by a sand layer that filters sediments, finer particulates and dissolved pollutants. The filtered water is collected by perforated underdrain pipes in a similar manner as in bioretention systems. Systems may also have an overflow chamber. The sedimentation chamber can have permanent water or can be designed to be drained with weep holes between storm events. Permanent water storage however, can risk anaerobic conditions that can lead to the release of pollutants (e.g. phosphorus). The design process should consider the provision of <b>detention</b> <b>storage</b> to yield a high hydrologic effectiveness, and discharge control by proper sizing of the perforated underdrain and overflow path. Regular maintenance is required to prevent crust forming.|$|E

In most cases the discharge reduction resulting from <b>detention</b> <b>storage</b> is minor and can be neglected in design. However, in some cases the storage effect is substantial, and accounting for it may result in a more economical design. This report presents new methods for quickly estimating the effects of <b>detention</b> <b>storage</b> on the performance of existing culverts and the sizing of new culverts. These methods, which do not require hydrograph routing, are applicable to pipe and box culverts operating under inlet control with no overtopping of the roadway. Peak discharges can be computed by the Rational method, USGS regression equations or any other appropriate method. Water-surface areas at two or more stages are needed to define an approximate depth-area relationship. The required areas can be estimated from existing topographic maps or measured in the field by one person with a rotating laser level and a GPS unit.

This drought event jolted the nation to explore alternative water resources such as rainwater for conserving the public water supply. Similarly rapid urbanisation which brought an increase of impervious areas and reduction of natural storages has increased urban peak runoff, burdening city drainage systems and compounding city flash flood problems.

Historically, facility storm water treatment volumes for wet detention facilities have been determined using simple technology based standards (e. g., detention of one inch of runoff), which are readily understood by the practicing engineer and enforced by the permit reviewer.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of a {{detention}} basin is to temporarily store runoff and to reduce peak discharge in the downstream conveyance system so that its capacity is not exceeded. The determination of required <b>detention</b> <b>storage</b> is based on volume calculations derived from the inflow hydrograph, along with the maximum outlet flow. In this work, utilizing a design storm approach, a yetograph with a variable intensity is proposed to maximize the volume of detention basins. The reliability of the yetograph in assessing a design volume which does not excessively overestimate the real ones is shown. The hyetograph is obtained deriving the depth-duration-frequency (DDF) curve, {{with respect to the}} duration, and drawing the resulting function so that the intensity increases with the duration. Since the starting hyetograph has an infinite duration, first a specific duration is chosen and then a constant intensity, corresponding to the selected duration, is assumed for the whole preceding period. The reliability assessment of the proposed hyetograph is shown by schematizing the rainfall-runoff process within the catchment by means of Nash’s model while the detention basin behavior is simulated by a linear reservoir model. The proposed hyetograph can be even coupled with more sophisticated models of detention basins...|$|E

Quantitative expressions of hydrological connectivity based on topography may improve the prediction of overland flow propagation, especially if the connectivity concept is applied at the subgrid scale of current hillslope models, which corresponds to the interrill scale. Our first objective was to measure the effect of micro-topography on overland flow. Some of the water is stored in depressions (depression storage) and some is temporarily stored in the flowing water layer (surface detention). To measure those storages, we used a new molding technique that reproduced realistic but waterproof soil surfaces, which were subjected to artificial runoff. The evolution of both storages following rainfall was related to the cumulative rainfall erosivity value. Our second objective was to find runoff-relevant connectivity properties of micro-topography. Based on numerical runoff experiments, we found that, among a number of existing structural connectivity indices and a proposed new functional connectivity index (namely the Relative Surface Connection function), the RSC function was the most robust and directly linkable to the runoff dynamics. Our last objective was to introduce the connectivity properties captured by the RSC function at the subgrid (interrill) scale in distributed hydrological models.

Therefore we developed a fast and cheap in-situ molding method (+/− 85 €/m 2) that combines alginate, plaster and lacquer. It allows creating stable and impermeable artificial micro-topographies that reproduce real field situations and that can be submitted to various laboratory runoff simulations. Both the surface of a specific soil and its artificial reproduction were measured with a laser scanner in order to assess the quality of the molding method. This method is shown to be precise {{with a standard deviation of}} 0. 55 mm, which is also the spatial resolution of the laser scanner method. This novel molding method was applied to get ten footprints of the micro-topography of a loamy bare soil, at different levels of cumulative rainfall erosivity value (R), starting with a tilled soil, and letting it evolve with natural rain events. We studied the evolution of the bulk values of depression <b>storage</b> and surface <b>detention</b> at the interrill scale, considering that these bulk values may provide useful input to hillslope models for which the size of the single grid cell corresponds to the size of our entire molds.

We found a general decrease of maximum depression storage and steady state surface detention with R.

It is thought that possibility of using a systematic and extensive data collection program for parameter identification using simple field measurements and engineering judgment together with stakeholder information for historical record verification provides opportunity to initiate structured and solution oriented data collection programs and modelling. Kotuwegoda area with land extent of 0. 475 km 2 and 22 sub catchments draining via 8 outlets was modeled for a single event. It was identified that the most sensitive parameter is channel roughness and that engineering options by means of changing channel roughness and incorporating <b>detention</b> <b>storage,</b> could reduce the peak flow by approximately 30...|$|E
40|$|Urban {{flooding}} causes large economic losses, {{property damage}} {{and loss of}} lives. The impact of environmental changes mainly, the urbanization and the climatic change leads to increased runoff and increased peak flows which the drainage system {{must be able to}} cope with to overcome possible damage and inconveniences caused by the induced flooding. Allowing for <b>detention</b> <b>storage</b> to compliment the capacity of the drainage system network is one of the approaches to reduce urban floods. The traditional practice was to design systems against stationary environmental forcings &ndash; including design rainfall, landuse, etc. Due to the rapid change in climate-environment, this approach is no longer economically viable and safe, and explicit consideration of changes that gradually take place during the life-time of the drainage system is warranted. In this paper, a staged cost optimization tool based on the hydraulic performance of the drainage system is presented. A one dimensional hydraulic model is used for hydraulic evaluation of the network together with a genetic algorithm based optimization tool to determine optimal intervention timings and amounts throughout the lifespan of the drainage network. The model was applied in a case study area in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil. It was concluded that considerable financial savings and/or additional level of flood-safety can be achieved by approaching the design problem as a staged plan rather than one-off scheme...|$|E
40|$|A pilot tube farm {{has been}} {{installed}} at the Mililani Sewage Treatment Plant, O'ahu, Hawai'i, to study the necessary treatment of activated sludge effluent for drip irrigation. Four types of effluent will be processed: 100 % effluent, 50 % effluent diluted with 50 % Waiahole Ditch water plus the 100 % effluent and the 50 % to 50 % mix after a 3 -day <b>detention</b> in reservoir <b>storage.</b> Efficacy of treatment {{will be determined by}} the rate of plugging of the holes in the drip irrigation tubes {{and the quality of the}} post-treated water. The present posttreatment system consists of two-stage pressure filtration: first through No. 3 anthracite, then through No. 11 crushed granite. Filtration rate is 0. 001 36 - 0. 002 7 m^ 3 /s/m^ 2 (2 - 4 gpm/ft^ 2). The filtrate is given chemical treatment by chlorine, bromine chloride, or chlorine dioxide at a dosage equivalent to a 10 mg/l chlorine residual at the end of the drip tube line. The system and the dosages will be varied to a level that will yield least plugging. Both single-chamber and dual-chamber tubing will be tested. The tube farm is automated and is operated on a 24 -hr day schedule, processing 100 % effluent for 12 hr and 50 to 50 % dilution for 12 hr. Backwash takes place at the end of the run. Mean values for the effluent and ditch water were respectively, suspended solids, 31 and 23 mg/l; total plate count, 3 and 30 organisms x 10 ^ 3 /ml; total coliform, 34 and 970 organisms/ml; and total organic carbon, 56 and 27 mg/l. The volatile suspended solids content was 90 % for the effluent but only 30 % for the ditch water. A reuse bibliography has been compiled. A hydraulics test stand facility has been developed to study the effects of plugging on the hydraulics of emitter flow in drip irrigation lateral lines. Department of Health, State of Hawaii; Board of Water Supply and Department of Public Works, City and County of Honolulu; and was conducted with the cooperation of the Hawaiian Sugar Planter's Association and the Oahu Sugar Company, Limite...|$|R
40|$|Engineers {{require a}} high level of skill in Excel, as most use the tool on a regular basis {{throughout}} their professional careers. Despite the proliferation of computers in the last decade, anecdotal evidence suggests that the majority of engineering undergraduate students leave High School with only a rudimentary understanding of the capability of Excel. Most see it as a tool to present graphs of their data. Though engineers working in the field of hydrology and hydraulics require the skills to run a variety of models, they don’t always have access to them. Even when the use of specific models is the norm, there are always requirements to undertake pre- and post-processing of data that are inputs and outputs, respectively, to these models. Excel provides the logical tool for undertaking this processing as it can be configured to undertake these tasks in an efficient and timely manner. A range of data quality checks can also be incorporated into the spreadsheet; an important part of water resources engineering tasks. One of the important parts of designing spreadsheets is to make them as flexible and re-usable as possible. That is, create a template that requires only the ingestion of a new dataset to undertake analyses. The students participating in the Reservoir and Stormwater course at the University of the Sunshine Coast (USC) build a portfolio of Excel spreadsheets that not only help develop their understanding of the fundamental principles of the subject, but also provide them with a valuable portfolio that implements the methods. They can build on this suite of spreadsheets throughout their career. The primary objectives of the Reservoir and Stormwater Engineering course are to prepare engineering students to design and analyse the hydrological characteristics of water storages and urban stormwater systems. The course is based on standard engineering procedures for designing the size of water storage reservoirs and stormwater drainage and management systems in urban areas. Topics covered include capacity-yield and behavioural characteristics of surface reservoirs, stormwater system design, including <b>detention</b> and retention <b>storage</b> designs, and the capabilities of urban rainfall-runoff models for simulating the quantity, and environmental impacts, of stormwater runoff. Using Excel as the tool for studying these methods provides the means of achieving the objectives as well as facilitating the development of high-level skills in Excel. This paper will explore the implementation in Excel of all the methods taught in this course...|$|R
40|$|Improving {{knowledge}} of a country's water resource is indispensable for the well being of its people and environment. Reliable information on the state and trends of water resources is a perquisite for sound decisions on the sustainable management of water resources. Probably {{since the beginning of}} human life on earth it would have been common knowledge that water is of great importance. Clusters of human habitats would have had water data and information systems built into their lives though there may not have been a necessity to document or structure them due to the abundance of the resource both in sufficient quantities and acceptable quality. However with the increasing growth and competition it has become a necessity for various management or administrative units to optimally manage the water available for such units. Accordingly water data and information systems have to be put in place so that the available resource could be understood and sustainable managed. Accurate and comprehensive water data are critical to engineers, planners and decision makers at all levels of government, researchers, developers, and the business community. Increasing demand for water, the associated need to rationally manage water, forecasting challenges which increase with the pressure of population growth and requirements of sustaining the environment, are demanding improvements in hydrologic analysis and predictions together with outputs with lesser uncertainties. This makes water data more important than in the past. Quantifiable spatial and temporal data and information on how much water is available in the country's river basins is required to provide a sound scientific basis to these assessments. Knowledge on the quality and distribution of the resource in space and time is also an important equirement. In Sri Lanka it had been identified that water data and information management is a key component in the sound assessment, planning and engineering of water resources and other water based activities and this is reflected in the report' which has highlighted areas where water data information activities within Government agencies could be improved. If the quest to acquire knowledge about water is to be successful then it is important to use data of correct temporal and spatial resolution and desired quality. Data resolution varies depending on whether the use is for water balance, flood assessment, rainfall predictions, urban drainage, <b>detention</b> and retention <b>storage</b> designs etc. Some sensitive data requires high accuracies while some data may not be demanding in terms of quality. As such {{it is important to note}} that appropriate water data and information are of extreme importance to carryout productive and contributory water assessments. On the other hand high resource demand makes it extremely expensive for a data and information system to capture, process and store all water and water related data at very fine spatial and temporal resolutions. This is due to the large requirement of staff and equipment for data capturing and the necessity of high speed, high capacity computers, servers, networks, associated equipment, capable staff and tools for processing etc., when handling large amounts of data. As such there should be research on data capture, storage, analysis and retrievals to make sure that optimal resources are used 207 180 for data and information management. Therefore research on how water data and information are to be captured. stored. analyzed and retrieved is of prime importance to ensure rational use and management of water resources...|$|R
