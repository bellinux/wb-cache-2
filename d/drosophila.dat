5|$|Fruit flies (<b>Drosophila),</b> {{because of}} the large array of {{techniques}} available for studying their genetics, have been a natural subject for studying the role of genes in brain development. In spite of the large evolutionary distance between insects and mammals, many aspects of <b>Drosophila</b> neurogenetics {{have been shown to be}} relevant to humans. The first biological clock genes, for example, were identified by examining <b>Drosophila</b> mutants that showed disrupted daily activity cycles. A search in the genomes of vertebrates revealed a set of analogous genes, which were found to play similar roles in the mouse biological clock—and therefore almost certainly in the human biological clock as well. Studies done on <b>Drosophila,</b> also show that most neuropil regions of the brain are continuously reorganized throughout life in response to specific living conditions.|$|E
5|$|Hsp90 cis-regulatory element regulates hsp90 in <b>Drosophila,</b> {{increasing}} the translation {{rate of the}} heat shock protein at high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} genes, as {{components of}} the antiviral innate immune system in many eukaryotes, are involved in an evolutionary arms race with viral genes. Some viruses have evolved mechanisms for suppressing the RNAi response in their host cells, particularly for plant viruses. Studies of evolutionary rates in <b>Drosophila</b> have shown that genes in the RNAi pathway are subject to strong directional selection and are among the fastest-evolving genes in the <b>Drosophila</b> genome.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Drosophila</b> melanogaster genome {{contains}} 29 serpin encoding genes. Amino acid {{sequence analysis}} has placed 14 of these serpins in serpin clade Q and three in serpin clade K {{with the remaining}} twelve classified as orphan serpins not belonging to any clade. The clade classification system is difficult to use for <b>Drosophila</b> serpins and instead a nomenclature system has been adopted {{that is based on}} the position of serpin genes on the <b>Drosophila</b> chromosomes. Thirteen of the <b>Drosophila</b> serpins occur as isolated genes in the genome (including Serpin-27A, see below), with the remaining 16 organised into five gene clusters that occur at chromosome positions 28D (2 serpins), 42D (5 serpins), 43A (4 serpins), 77B (3 serpins) and 88E (2 serpins).|$|E
5|$|Although animals {{generally}} express fewer {{variants of}} the dicer enzyme than plants, RNAi in some animals produces an antiviral response. In both juvenile and adult <b>Drosophila,</b> RNA interference {{is important in}} antiviral innate immunity and is active against pathogens such as <b>Drosophila</b> X virus. A similar role in immunity may operate in C. elegans, as argonaute proteins are upregulated in response to viruses and worms that overexpress components of the RNAi pathway are resistant to viral infection.|$|E
5|$|B snurposomes {{are found}} in the {{amphibian}} oocyte nuclei and in <b>Drosophila</b> melanogaster embryos. B snurposomes appear alone or attached to the Cajal bodies in the electron micrographs of the amphibian nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Homologs of BRCA2 {{are also}} {{essential}} for meiosis in the fungus Ustilago maydis, the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, and the fruitfly <b>Drosophila</b> melanogaster.|$|E
5|$|Animals such as {{the fruit}} fly <b>Drosophila</b> melanogaster, the zebrafish, the chicken and the house mouse, serve {{a major role in}} science as {{experimental}} models, both in fundamental biological research, such as in genetics, and in the development of new medicines, which must be tested exhaustively to demonstrate their safety. Millions of mammals, especially mice and rats, are used in experiments each year.|$|E
5|$|Exogenous dsRNA is {{detected}} and bound by an effector protein, known as RDE-4 in C. elegans and R2D2 in <b>Drosophila,</b> that stimulates dicer activity. This protein only binds long dsRNAs, but the mechanism producing this length specificity is unknown. This RNA-binding protein then facilitates {{the transfer of}} cleaved siRNAs to the RISC complex.|$|E
5|$|In vertebrates, the CAS protein family {{contains}} four members: p130Cas/BCAR1, NEDD9/HEF1, EFS and CASS4. There are no {{paralogous genes}} for this family in acoelomates, pseudocoelomates, and nematodes, while a single ancestral member {{is found in}} <b>Drosophila.</b> Evolutionary divergence of the CAS proteins family members is discussed by Singh et al. in detail.|$|E
5|$|Sean B. Carroll is a {{professor}} of molecular biology and genetics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He studies the evolution of cis-regulatory elements (pieces of non-coding DNA) which help to regulate gene expression in developing embryos, using the fruit fly <b>Drosophila</b> as the model organism. He has won the Shaw Scientist Award and the Stephen Jay Gould Prize for his work.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies are}} used as a primary food source by the red {{squirrel}} Sciurus vulgaris, and have a higher protein content than the other mushrooms typically consumed by this species. Decaying fruit bodies are also used as a food source by fruit flies belonging to the genus <b>Drosophila.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Drosophila</b> melanogaster – Edward Lewis {{discovered}} the <b>Drosophila</b> Bithorax complex of homeotic genes.|$|E
25|$|Like other metazoans, <b>Drosophila</b> is {{associated}} with various bacteria in its gut. The fly gut microbiota or microbiome {{seems to have a}} central influence on <b>Drosophila</b> fitness and life history characteristics. The microbiota in the gut of <b>Drosophila</b> represents an active current research field.|$|E
25|$|The genus <b>Drosophila</b> as {{currently}} defined is paraphyletic (see below) and contains 1,450 described species, while {{the total number}} of species is estimated at thousands. The majority of the species are members of two subgenera: <b>Drosophila</b> (about 1,100 species) and Sophophora (including D. (S.) melanogaster; around 330 species). The Hawaiian species of <b>Drosophila</b> (estimated to be more than 500, with roughly 380 species described) are sometimes recognized as a separate genus or subgenus, Idiomyia, but this is not widely accepted. About 250 species are part of the genus Scaptomyza, which arose from the Hawaiian <b>Drosophila</b> and later recolonized continental areas.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that invertebrate and vertebrate signaling downstream from Smoothened has diverged significantly. The role of Suppressor of Fused (SUFU) has been enhanced in vertebrates compared to <b>Drosophila</b> where its role is relatively minor. Costal-2 is particularly important in <b>Drosophila.</b> The protein kinase Fused is a regulator of SUFU in <b>Drosophila,</b> but may not {{play a role in the}} Hh pathway of vertebrates. In vertebrates, Hh signaling has been heavily coupled to cilia.|$|E
25|$|The genus Zaprionus was {{described}} in 1902 by Daniel William Coquillett. He considered the genus {{closely related to the}} genus <b>Drosophila.</b> Molecular studies have confirmed this relationship, and the genus Zaprionus is positioned within the paraphyletic genus <b>Drosophila.</b>|$|E
25|$|Early {{findings}} on Notch signaling in Central Nervous System (CNS) development were performed mainly in <b>Drosophila</b> with mutagenesis experiments. For example, {{the finding that}} an embryonic lethal phenotype in <b>Drosophila</b> was associated with Notch dysfunction indicated that Notch mutations {{can lead to the}} failure of neural and Epidermal cell segregation in early <b>Drosophila</b> embryos. In the past decade, advances in mutation and knockout techniques allowed research on the Notch signaling pathway in mammalian models, especially rodents.|$|E
25|$|Armadillo repeats : {{named after}} the β-catenin-like Armadillo protein of the fruit fly <b>Drosophila.</b>|$|E
25|$|Polygamy is {{also common}} among some animals, {{such as the}} common fruit-fly, <b>Drosophila</b> melanogaster.|$|E
25|$|<b>Drosophila</b> {{genes are}} {{traditionally}} {{named after the}} phenotype they cause when mutated. For example, {{the absence of a}} particular gene in <b>Drosophila</b> will result in a mutant embryo that does not develop a heart. Scientists have thus called this gene tinman, named after the Oz character of the same name. This system of nomenclature results in a wider range of gene names than in other organisms.|$|E

25|$|In November 2012, Schubert et al. {{reveal that}} {{specific}} RNAs control chromatin compaction and accessibility in <b>Drosophila</b> cells.|$|E
25|$|G. ruricola is {{the host}} {{organism}} for two species of flies in the genus <b>Drosophila.</b> They were first observed on Montserrat by Henry Guernsey Hubbard in 1894, and presented at a scientific meeting later that year (where the crab was misidentified as Cardisoma guanhumi), but no further research was conducted until 1955, when specimens were again collected, this time from Mona Island, and named as <b>Drosophila</b> carcinophila by M. R. Wheeler.|$|E
25|$|It is now {{relatively}} simple to generate transgenic flies in <b>Drosophila,</b> {{relying on a}} variety of techniques. One approach of inserting foreign genes into the <b>Drosophila</b> genome involves P elements. The transposable P elements, also known as transposons, are segments of bacterial DNA that are transferred into the fly genome. Transgenic flies have already contributed to many scientific advances, e.g., modeling such human diseases as Parkinson's, neoplasia, obesity, and diabetes.|$|E
25|$|The modEncode {{consortium}} {{is currently}} sequencing eight more <b>Drosophila</b> genomes, {{and even more}} genomes are being sequenced by the i5K consortium.|$|E
25|$|One mir-2 microRNA in <b>Drosophila,</b> dme-miR-2a-2 , is two {{nucleotides}} offset {{with respect}} to the canonical products of other mir-2 precursors. This is likely to affect the function of that particular microRNA. This functional shift is associated to a change in the genomic distribution of mir-2 sequences in <b>Drosophila.</b> The functional diversification of microRNAs may require breaking the genomic linkage between paralogs, probably to avoid the co-regulation of multiple products by the same regulatory sequences.|$|E
25|$|Several of the subgeneric and generic {{names are}} based on anagrams of <b>Drosophila,</b> {{including}} Dorsilopha, Lordiphosa, Siphlodora, Phloridosa, and Psilodorha.|$|E
25|$|The {{hedgehog}} gene (hh) was first {{identified in the}} fruit-fly <b>Drosophila</b> melanogaster in the classic Heidelberg screens of Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus, as published in 1980. These screens, which led to them winning the Nobel Prize in 1995 along with developmental geneticist Edward B. Lewis, identified genes that control the segmentation pattern of the <b>Drosophila</b> embryos. The hh loss of function mutant phenotype causes the embryos to be covered with denticles, small pointy projections resembling the spines of a hedgehog.|$|E
25|$|<b>Drosophila</b> melanogaster is {{a species}} of fly (the taxonomic order Diptera) in the family Drosophilidae. The species is known {{generally}} as the common fruit fly or vinegar fly. Starting with Charles W. Woodworth's proposal {{of the use of}} this species as a model organism, D. melanogaster continues to be widely used for biological research in genetics, physiology, microbial pathogenesis, and life history evolution. As of 2017, eight Nobel prizes had been awarded for research using <b>Drosophila.</b>|$|E
25|$|In invertebrates, {{just as in}} <b>Drosophila,</b> {{the binding}} of Hedgehog to PTCH leads to {{internalisation}} and sequestration of the ligand. Consequently, in vivo the passage of hedgehog over a receptive field that expresses the receptor leads to attenuation of the signal, an effect called ligand-dependent antagonism (LDA). In contrast to <b>Drosophila,</b> vertebrates possess another level of hedgehog regulation through LDA mediated by Hh-interacting protein 1 (HHIP1). HHIP1 also sequesters hedgehog ligands, but unlike PTCH, it {{has no effect on}} the activity of SMO.|$|E

25|$|Paraquat also induces {{oxidative}} stress in invertebrates such as <b>Drosophila</b> melanogaster. Paraquat-fed flies suffer early-onset mortality and {{significant increases in}} superoxide dismutase activity.|$|E
