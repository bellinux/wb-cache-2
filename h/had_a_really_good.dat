If we were ever going to come {{together}} on any kind of record, this is definitely the right one, and really the coolest thing {{to me is that}} after all of the drama and everybody making it like we had a rivalry, she was just really cool and we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> time in the studio. We had fun. And so, if nothing else, it was a good experience... and diva-ism, whatever." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{completing}} Backspacer in 2009, Pearl Jam and producer Brendan O'Brien intended to soon repeat the experience given {{that according to}} O'Brien [...] "we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> time doing it.". In 2011, amidst preparations for the documentary Pearl Jam Twenty and its accompanying tour, the band recorded some tracks with O'Brien at Los Angeles' Henson Recording Studios, with the song [...] "Olé" [...] being issued as a free download. O'Brien considered that the studio helped the band get to a [...] "submarine mentality, and everybody going into the ship together", and bassist Jeff Ament added that working outside the band's hometown Seattle led the musicians to work more efficiently.|$|E
500|$|For his stylistic {{influences}} {{for playing}} drums, Mark references Stewart Copeland of The Police who he [...] "always thought ... <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> style", Neil Peart of Rush, John Bonham of Led Zeppelin, and Keith Moon of The Who. Following {{the release of}} The Fiction We Live, then screaming vocalist Perri explained that the lyrics he was writing for the forthcoming album (Abandon Your Friends) would feature lyrics that were inspired by Billy Joel, stating that they were [...] "billyjoelesque" [...] because [...] "they’re more straightforward, not what I’m thinking, what I’m feeling, instead of poetry and shit". However, {{it is unclear whether}} the lyrics were used on the album, as was revealed by Mark in 2007, that Perri had not contributed to Abandon Your Friends and it was Mark who had ghostwritten the lyrics.|$|E

500|$|In October 2009, it was {{reported}} that [...] "Wear My Kiss" [...] would be released as the third single from Sweet 7 on 8 February 2010. The song was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 21 February 2010 as a digital download, and as a CD single the following day. During an interview with David Balls of Digital Spy, group member Heidi Range explained the reason for the song's release as the album's third single, saying: [...] "It's <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> response from radio and our fans on the website. It's also quite appropriate as it comes out around Valentine's Day – there's a lot of kissing going on then!" [...] "Wear My Kiss" [...] was remixed by the British music production team 7th Heaven.|$|E
500|$|Ruck {{says that}} with Cameron Frye, Hughes gave him [...] "the best part I {{ever had in}} a movie, and any success that I've had since 1985 is because he took a big chance on me. I'll be forever grateful." [...] "While we were making the movie, I just knew I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> part", Ruck says. [...] "My {{realization}} of John's impact on the teen-comedy genre crept in sometime later. Teen comedies tend {{to dwell on the}} ridiculous, as a rule. It's always the preoccupation with sex and the self-involvement, and we kind of hold the kids up for ridicule in a way. Hughes added this element of dignity. He was an advocate for teenagers as complete human beings, and he honored their hopes and their dreams. That's what you see in his movies." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Party" [...] was {{directed}} by Beyoncé and Alan Ferguson. As reported by Rap-Up, Beyoncé filmed the clip in the Oakdale Mobile Home Park in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, on August 2, 2011. The video shoot called for multiple flashy fashions, a red muscle car, and colorfully dressed dancers. Solange Knowles, Beyoncé's younger sister, and Kelly Rowland, former Destiny's Child member, both made cameos. Rowland elaborated a bit about {{her role in the}} video in an interview with NeonLimelight: [...] "I'm just doing a cameo. We just <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> time [...] While filming the video, we noticed that we were doing certain stuff that we used to do as kids. We kinda felt a little goofy for a second, so we stopped. But we just had a good time.". Model Shaun Ross also makes a cameo in the video.|$|E

500|$|Drummer Dave Lombardo, on {{the other}} hand, asserts the album was professionally done {{compared}} to Show No Mercy: [...] "I didn't have to overdub the cymbals, and we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> engineer." [...] Lombardo's favorite song is [...] "At Dawn They Sleep", [...] "because {{it was kind of}} slow and grungy, but then it had that double-bass part at the end." [...] While recording the track, neither guitarists King or Jeff Hanneman who wrote the lyrics were in the studio—only Araya and Slagel. On reading the lyrics, which featured a misspelled word, Araya sang it as it was spelled, although it's not a real word. The song [...] "Hardening of the Arteries" [...] on the album ends with the a very similar section that makes up the beginning of the song [...] "Hell Awaits" [...] and {{is also one of the}} only Slayer songs to fade out on a continuous riff.|$|E
500|$|Piller was {{disappointed}} with the following Ro episode, [...] "", as it {{put her in the}} position of disbelieving Counselor Deanna Troi without having had the weight of [...] "victories" [...] in the past to convince the viewer of the power of her convictions. But he enjoyed her sudden relationship with Commander William Riker in [...] "". Forbes shared the view of that episode, later saying [...] "When you have amnesia, you wonder if that brings out a side of you that's always wanted to come out. Would you really be comfortable with that? It's an interesting thing. I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> time with that episode." [...] Later in the season, [...] "The Next Phase" [...] was written with the idea of being a vehicle for Geordi La Forge and Troi, but it was decided to include Ro instead as one of the lead characters. Ro had been included as one of three lead characters in Morgan Gendel's original pitch for the episode [...] "". This would have seen her in a love triangle with Picard and Riker. Instead, the concept was redeveloped to focus solely on Picard.|$|E
500|$|No. 80 Wing {{had begun}} {{transferring}} to the Dutch East Indies in December 1944, {{and the main}} body followed in January 1945. Gibbes' injuries prevented him from joining the formation at its base on Morotai, where it came {{under the control of}} the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF), until 9March. Once there, he took over as temporary commanding officer for a few days when Caldwell was called to Manila. In April, Gibbes was one of eight senior pilots, including Caldwell and fellow aces Wilf Arthur and John Waddy, who tendered their resignations in protest at the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground-attack missions. The incident became known as the [...] "Morotai Mutiny". Gibbes later declared that [...] "...after I myself had been operating for a week or so and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> look around and seen the futility of the operations which had been given, I could not see any point in carrying on. I certainly lost all keenness for remaining in the service." [...] As a former jackaroo, he was especially upset about one sortie that involved attacking cattle: [...] "I felt horrible about it, being an ex bushy...at about lunch time I went out and darned if I didn't have to turn butcher. And Heavens, it was butchering too, in every sense of the word. No—not the Japs. Cattle...If we are to get the Japs out of this area without loss of human lives, starvation will be our main weapon...God, I hated doing it but could do nothing else. Felt as sick as hell." [...] No action was taken against the [...] "mutineers" [...] for their attempted resignations; a subsequent government inquiry found that their protest was justified. In the meantime, Gibbes and Caldwell were court martialled for their involvement in alcohol trafficking on Morotai. Both were reduced to the rank of flight lieutenant; the Air Officer Commanding No.1 TAF, Air Commodore Harry Cobby, himself shortly to be dismissed over the [...] "mutiny", restored Gibbes to squadron leader effective [...] 23April.|$|E

She commented, [...] "I've <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> two years, enjoyed all the experiences but it's time to move on". A spokesman for the soap said, [...] "It’s her decision to go. We’d like to thank her for all her fantastic work and wish her {{the very best of}} luck." [...] Johnson filmed her final scenes in October and her departure coincided with that of Vicki's half-sister, Sharon (Letitia Dean). [...] Vicki departed on the Christmas Day episode of 2004. 12.3 million viewers watched the episodes that involved the Watts family's disbandment. Media reports claimed that there were plans to bring Vicki back the following year, played by a new actress; this proved to be false. Her character was notably absent at the funerals of Vicki's father Den in September 2005, her brother Dennis in January 2006, and her grandmother Pauline in January 2007.|$|E

Food had been scarce, and while Reddy had always {{obtained}} enough to keep from starving, {{it was a long}} time since he had <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> meal. He had, you remember, traveled a very long distance to catch that fat hen, and it had been many hours since he had had a bite of anything.

60|$|What {{would have}} become of the singing without him? The first hint against the {{remarkable}} anthems had long ago alienated our tuneful choir placed on high, and they had deserted en masse. Then Emily and the schoolmistress had toiled at the school children, whose thin little pipes and provincialisms were a painful infliction, till Mrs. Henderson, backed by Clarence, worked up a few promising men's voices to support them. We thought everything but the New and Old Versions smacked of dissent, except the hymns {{at the end of}} the Prayer-book, though we did not go as far as Chapman, who told Emily he understood as how all the tunes was tried over in Doctor's Commons afore they were sent out, and it was not 'liable' to change them. One of Clarence's amusements in his lonely life had been the acquisition of a knowledge of music, and he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> voice; while his adherence to our choir encouraged other young men of the farmer and artisan class to join us.

60|$|The {{interior}} of the room as he entered it made an attractive picture which even in his hurry caught Foy's eye and fixed itself so firmly in his mind that he never forgot its details. To begin with, the place was beautifully furnished, for his brother <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> taste in tapestry, pictures, and other such adornments. Adrian himself lay upon a richly carved oak bed, pale from loss of blood, but otherwise little the worse. Seated {{by the side of}} the bed, looking wonderfully sweet in the lamplight, which cast shadows from the curling hair about her brows on to the delicate face beneath, was Elsa Brant. She had been reading to Adrian from a book of Spanish chivalry such as his romantic soul loved, and he, resting on his elbow in the snowy bed, was contemplating her beauty with his languishing black eyes. Yet, although he only saw her for a moment before she heard his entry and looked up, it was obvious to Foy that Elsa remained quite unconscious of the handsome Adrian's admiration, indeed, that her mind wandered far away from the magnificent adventures and highly coloured love scenes of which she was reading in her sweet, low voice. Nor was he mistaken, for, in fact, the poor child was thinking of her father.|$|E
