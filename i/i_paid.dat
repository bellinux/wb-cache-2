500|$|During {{press for}} the popular 2015 film Straight Outta Compton, {{questions}} about the portrayal and behavior of Dr. Dre and other prominent figures in the rap community about violence against women – and the question about its absence in the film – were raised. The discussion about the film led to Dr. Dre addressing his past behavior in the press. In August 2015, {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, Dre lamented his abusive past, saying, [...] "I made some fucking horrible mistakes in my life. I was young, fucking stupid. I would say all the allegations aren't true—some of them are. Those {{are some of the things}} that I would like to take back. It was really fucked up.

[...] He also {{described}} Donen as being thought of as his whipping-boy at MGM. Although Donen often complained that Kelly never gave him enough credit for their work, Kelly did credit him for the Jerry the Mouse and [...] "Alter Ego" [...] dance sequences.

500|$|Henry's successor, Richard <b>I,</b> <b>paid</b> {{relatively}} {{little attention to}} Kenilworth, but under King John significant building resumed at the castle. When John was excommunicated in 1208, he embarked on a programme of rebuilding and enhancing several major royal castles. These included Corfe, Odiham, Dover, Scarborough as well as Kenilworth. John spent £1,115 on Kenilworth Castle between 1210 and 1216, building the outer bailey wall in stone and improving the other defences, including creating Mortimer's and Lunn's Towers. [...] He also significantly improved the castle's water defences by damming the Finham and Inchford Brooks, creating the Great Mere. The result was to turn Kenilworth {{into one of the}} largest English castles of the time, with one of the largest artificial lake defences in England. John was forced to cede the castle to the baronial opposition as part of the guarantee of the Magna Carta, before it reverted to royal control early in the reign of his son, Henry III.|$|E
500|$|Datchet on {{the north}} bank of the River Thames has existed as a {{settlement}} since before 990 but the first recorded mention of a river crossing is in 1224 when Henry III gave John le Passir a [...] "great oak" [...] with which to make a boat for [...] "passage of Datchet". In 1278 Edward <b>I</b> <b>paid</b> for William of Eton to a build a [...] "great barge" [...] for Datchet Ferry. Although the Crown had provided for the vessels, the right to operate the ferry and collect tolls sat with the Lord of the Manor of Datchet. This continued until 1680 when the then Lord of the Manor, Colonel Andrew Pitcairn Wheeler, sold the Manor of Datchet to Budd Wase but kept back the ferry rights which he subsequently mortgaged for £1000 (equivalent to £ today). In 1699 Wheeler wrote to William III complaining that a wall built by the King along the Windsor bank was adversely affecting the ferry trade. To settle the complaint the Crown purchased the ferry rights from Colonel Wheeler for £7000 (equivalent to £ today).|$|E
500|$|Troutman, {{seeing the}} disarray that was {{surrounding}} Clinton at the time, accepted Warner Bros. offer of {{more money for}} the demo recordings of his album. The move resulted in a bitter severing of partnerships between Clinton and Troutman, and with Clinton's departure, Troutman was left to exercise virtually full creative control over the band's later work. In Clinton's biography George Clinton: For the Record, Troutman was quoted commenting on the situation with a blasé attitude, [...] "... Heck gee-willickers, Warner Bros. offered me mo' money". In response, Clinton remarked, [...] "CBS paid for it, <b>I</b> <b>paid</b> for it. I don't like {{to go into it}} on the negative side, but it cost about 5 million , and a lot of people's jobs and what we consider as the empire falling". [...] The loss of money that resulted from the actions of Troutman, is credited as one of the factors that disassembled both Clinton's and Funkadelic's musical careers. [...] The Many Facets of Roger was eventually released in August 1981 on Warner Bros.|$|E

500|$|Conway {{continued}} McConnell's line {{of attack}} on Bevin's finances, specifically the issue of delinquent taxes. While McConnell's charges involved delinquent taxes against Bevin Brothers Manufacturing, Theo Keith of Louisville's WAVE reported in June that Bevin had been late at least 10 times paying property taxes on his vacation homes in Maine and Louisiana between 2002 and 2009. He further reported in July that Bevin's company, Integrity Holdings, also had multiple past delinquency issues. In total, Keith estimated that Bevin had paid about $1,800 in penalties for late tax payments. Bevin became irritated with Keith's reporting and refused to answer questions from him at subsequent press conferences; he did not buy ads on WAVE, despite running ads on Louisville's other three network broadcast stations. The Associated Press' Adam Beam eventually reported that Bevin had paid his taxes late on 30 different occasions. In an October interview with Beam, Bevin said, [...] "Sometimes you do pay it late and you pay interest on having paid it late. But you pay the taxes. ... You do {{this all the time}} in business." [...] He added that his critics [...] "could have done just as breathless a story of all the times <b>I</b> <b>paid</b> my taxes early and gotten a discount on it." [...] He also reiterated that, as of the time of the interview, he had paid all of his taxes: [...] "Do I actually owe taxes to anyone, anywhere? The answer is no." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{their book}} Education in Popular Culture, Alma Harris, Roy Fisher, Ann Harris, and Christine Jarvis {{analyzes}} the adult education {{aspects of this}} episode that portrays adult learners as [...] "stupid and lazy". After Homer is appointed as a teacher, he feels immensely proud and boasts to all his acquaintances about it, initially making it seem like if the show is indicating that adult education tutors have a relatively high status in society. [...] "However," [...] the authors added, [...] "Homer's pride is undercut for the audience by the awareness of {{how he came to}} be appointed and by the subsequent representation of the adult education center. It seems that anyone can become a tutor. [...] Homer's fellow tutors are drunks, incompetents and down-and-outs, adult education is therefore presented as an amateur business staffed by the dregs of society." [...] The writers of the book thought the whole idea of storytelling and building on experience that Homer uses, and that many adult education tutors uses in real life, is represented in the episode [...] "simply as an excuse for gossip and prurient curiosity". They also thought that statements like [...] "I can't believe <b>I</b> <b>paid</b> ten thousand dollars for this course. What the heck was the lab fee for?" [...] imply that adult education is [...] "exploitative and poor value for money, and that the students themselves contribute to this by demanding an essentially recreational service." [...] The authors concluded that the episode [...] "certainly sustains a popular view of adult education as pointless and recreational. Similarly, no value whatsoever is attributed to the extensively researched, proven through practice and well-argued perspective that adult learners do best when the curriculum builds on and values their experience." ...|$|E

Hodge gained 96,000 shares worth £1.5 million as a result. Hodge said she had played no part in administering or establishing the scheme. She explained: [...] "All I could do as a shareholder in a company not run by me, and over which I had no influence or control, was to ensure that any shares I held were above board and that <b>I</b> <b>paid</b> all relevant taxes in full.

[...] In the early 1980s, Zemeckis married actress Mary Ellen Trainor, with whom he had a son, Alexander Francis. He described the marriage as difficult to balance with filmmaking, and his relationship with Trainor eventually ended in divorce. On December 4, 2001, he married actress Leslie Harter, with whom he has two children.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{basketball}} observers, {{in addition}} to Abdul-Jabbar, believe that Kareem's reticence, whether through disdain for the press corps or simply because of introversion, contributed to the dearth of coaching opportunities offered to Abdul-Jabbar by the NBA. In his words, {{he said he had}} a mindset he could not overcome, and proceeded through his career oblivious to the effect his reticence may have had on his future coaching prospects. Abdul-Jabbar said: [...] "I didn't understand that I also had affected people that way and that's what it was all about. I always saw it like they were trying to pry. I was way too suspicious and <b>I</b> <b>paid</b> a price for it."

[...] According to Turkish authorities, investigations into the smuggling operations in Turkey showed that refugees were often tasked with helping smugglers sign up passengers for smuggling trips. It was also not uncommon for one of the passengers to be given the responsibility of driving the boat. No smuggler, with family in Turkey and a steady income from the lucrative smuggling trade, would want to end up illegally in Europe and risk not being able to return home, where he would be likely to face arrest anyway. The President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan offered Alan's father Abdullah citizenship of Turkey.|$|E
