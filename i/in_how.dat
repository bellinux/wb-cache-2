5|$|Although the Coris were {{discouraged}} from working together at Roswell, {{they continued to}} do so, specializing in investigating carbohydrate metabolism. They were particularly interested <b>in</b> <b>how</b> glucose is metabolized {{in the human body}} and the hormones that regulate this process. They published fifty papers while at Roswell, with first author status going to the one who had done most of the research for a given paper. Gerty Cori published eleven articles as the sole author. In 1929, they proposed the theoretical cycle that later won them the Nobel Prize, the Cori cycle.|$|E

5|$|Another {{method that}} has been used to {{establish}} the date of eruption is tree-ring dating. Tree-ring data has shown that a large event interfering with normal tree growth in North America occurred during 1629–1628 (±65 years)BCE. Evidence of a climatic event around 1628BCE has been found in studies of growth depression of European oaks in Ireland and of Scotch pines in Sweden. Bristlecone pine frost rings also indicate a date of 1627BCE, supporting the late 1600sBCE dating. Procedural changes <b>in</b> <b>how</b> ice cores are interpreted would bring that data more in line with the dendrochronological numbers.|$|E
5|$|Chekhov {{has also}} {{influenced}} {{the work of}} Japanese playwrights including Shimizu Kunio, Yōji Sakate, and Ai Nagai.

Sakate adapted several of Chekhov's plays and transformed them in the general style of nō. Nagai also adapted Chekhov's plays, including Three Sisters, and transformed his dramatic style into Nagai's style of satirical realism while emphasising the social issues depicted on the play.|$|E

5|$|In February 1942, Casterman {{suggested}} to Hergé that his books {{be published in}} a new format; 62-pages rather than the former 100 to 130 pages, and now in full colour rather than black-and-white.
