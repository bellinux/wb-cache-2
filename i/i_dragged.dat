2500|$|There {{was also}} a natural link between pacifism and {{maternal}} feminism. Augusta Stowe-Gullen (1857–1943) said in 1915 that [...] "when women {{have a voice in}} national and international affairs, war will cease forever." [...] This became an increasingly hard position to support as World War <b>I</b> <b>dragged</b> on. Some who stayed true to maternal feminism and pacifism during the war were also socialist or communist, such as the Canadian Gertrude Richardson.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001 Anson Rainey {{proposed}} that a two-word phrase in line 12—'R'L DWDH—should {{be read as}} a reference an [...] "altar hearth of David" [...] at Ataroth, one of the towns captured by Mesha. [...] The sentence reads: [...] "I (i.e., Mesha) carried from there (Atartoth) the 'R'L of its DWD (or: its 'R'L of DVD) and <b>I</b> <b>dragged</b> it before Kemosh in Qeriot". The meaning of both words is unclear. One line of thought sees 'R'L as the name of a man (literally [...] "El is my light") and translates DWD as [...] "defender", so that the sense of the passage is that Mesha, having conquered Ataroth, dragged its [...] "defender", whose name was [...] "El is my light", to the altar of Kemosh, where he was presumably sacrificed. It seems more likely that some kind of cult-vessel is meant, and other suggestions have included [...] "the lion-statue of its beloved", meaning the city god.|$|E
