The role of <b>fibrin</b> <b>sealants</b> in decreasing the risk of POPF remains debatable. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the literature regarding the effectiveness of <b>fibrin</b> <b>sealants</b> in pancreatic surgery. MethodsA comprehensive database search was conducted. Only randomized controlled trials comparing <b>fibrin</b> <b>sealants</b> with standard care were included. A meta-analysis regarding POPF, intra-abdominal collections, post-operative haemorrhage, pancreatitis and wound infections was performed according to the recommendations of the Cochrane collaboration. ResultsSeven studies were included, accounting for 897 patients. Compared with controls, patients receiving <b>fibrin</b> <b>sealants</b> had a pooled odds ratio (OR) of developing a POPF of 0. 83 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 6 – 1. 14], P = 0. 245.

40|$|Objective: We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} human bile on the stability of plasma clots and of <b>fibrin</b> <b>sealants.</b> Background: <b>Fibrin</b> <b>sealants</b> are extensively used in liver surgery, for example, during liver resections. Although these sealants {{have been developed to}} induce hemostasis, in practice these products are actually mainly used to seal dissected bile ducts to prevent postsurgical bile leakage. Methods: We performed in vitro assays in which clotting and lysis of human plasma clots or <b>fibrin</b> <b>sealants</b> was studied in presence or absence of human bile. Results: Addition of bile to human plasma resulted in a dose-dependent increase in clotting time, and a dose-dependent decrease in clot lysis time. Bile also accelerated lysis of in vitro clotted <b>fibrin</b> <b>sealants.</b> Immunodepletion of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) resulted in partial depletion of the lysis promoting activity of bile. Immunodepletion of both tPA and lysine-binding proteins from bile fully abolished the lytic activity, suggesting that tPA and plasminogen present in human bile are responsible for the lysis-promoting effect. Surprisingly, addition of high dose plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI- 1) to bile did not attenuate the lytic activity toward <b>fibrin</b> <b>sealants,</b> which suggested that tPA in a biliary environment may be unsusceptible to PAI- 1 inhibition. Indeed, bile acids were shown to prevent tPA from interacting with PAI- 1, although preformed complexes were not destabilized upon addition of bile acids. Conclusions: These combined results suggest that the presence of tPA and other fibrinolytic proteins in human bile results in lysis of plasma clots or <b>fibrin</b> <b>sealants,</b> which potentially could affect the efficacy of the latter products...|$|R

MethodsStudies published through May 2013 were identified from PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane library, ScienceDirect, and other databases. Two independent reviewers assessed the quality of methodology using the Grade of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach and extracted data from literature.

50|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the removal of}} a tooth, bleeding or just oozing very commonly occurs. Pressure is applied by biting on a gauze swab, and a thrombus (blood clot) forms in the socket (hemostatic response). Common haemostatic measures include local pressure application with gauze and the used of oxidized cellulose (gelfoam) and <b>fibrin</b> <b>sealant.</b> Dental practitioners usually have absorbent gauze, haemostatic packing material (oxidised cellulose, collagen sponge) and suture kit available. Sometimes 30 minutes of continuous pressure is required to fully arrest bleeding. Talking, which moves the mandible and hence removes the pressure applied on the socket, instead of keeping constant pressure, is a very common reason that bleeding might not stop. This is likened to someone with a bleeding wound on their arm, when being instructed to apply pressure, instead holds the wound intermittently every few moments. Coagulopathies (clotting disorders, e.g. hemophilia) are sometimes discovered {{for the first time}} if a person has had no other surgical procedure in their life, but this is rare. Sometimes the blood clot can be dislodged, triggering more bleeding and formation of a new blood clot, or leading to a dry socket (see complications).

Methods: A prospective, controlled "right-left side" study was carried out in 20 patients. The two <b>fibrin</b> <b>sealants</b> used were Quixil® and Tissucol®. The two sealants were used at the same time, ie, one on one side of the face and the other on the contralateral side. Comparisons were made with regard to rates of hematoma and seroma, degree of induration, edema, ecchymosis, pain levels, and patient satisfaction. Results: The results were almost equivalent. The only exception was a significant (40 mL) hematoma in a patient treated with Quixil. Bleeding was most likely due to a sudden rise in blood pressure during the immediate postoperative period. However, it must be emphasized that, while Tissucol actually seals the undermined area, thus virtually eliminating the dead space, Quixil acts differently, in that its effectiveness in preventing hematoma is linked mainly to its hemostatic effect.

30|$|Liver {{resection}} is {{an effective}} way to treat cancers in the liver [1]. However, heavy bleeding usually occurs in liver resection due to the abundant blood vessel in this special site [2]. Failure to stop bleeding timely can lead to serious organ failure which could even threaten the human life [3]. Current methods to stop bleeding are mostly focused on mechanical methods like suture and ligation, thermal methods like electrocautery [4], and using hemostatic method agents like <b>fibrin</b> <b>sealants</b> [5, 6], gelatin matrix [7], and chitosan hydrogel adhesive [8]. Of course, all of them have obvious advantages and limitations. For example, suture is {{the most effective way to}} stop bleeding, but it needs a timely and meticulous process; otherwise, it causes long-term ischemia [9]. Similarly, thermal methods can damage the local tissues and may make it abnormal from normal tissue which cannot be distinguished easily [10]. Moreover, <b>fibrin</b> <b>sealants</b> widely used for hemostasis can easily lead to adverse human immune response, and they also have disadvantages such as short shelf life, vulnerable to microbial intrusion, and high price [11]. In contrast, e-spinning technology shows excellent potential in hemostasis for its special features such as using less dosage and coating on wound sites even with irregular surfaces [12, 13]. However, the existing e-spinning techniques and devices for hemostasis still have several problems to overcome: (1) volume and weight are so bulky that they cannot be easily carried around, (2) inaccurate deposition of fibers [14] takes a longer time to realize the same hemostasis effect and may also cause tissue adhesion after operation, and (3) they depend on the urban electricity supply, so they are not suitable for usages in outdoor and remote areas without power supply [15]. Although our group recently reported an airflow-assisted e-spinning technique which utilizes an air-pump blower to enable orientated deposition of fibers [12], it needs additional power supply for the air pump. Therefore, a portable e-spinning technique and device that do not rely on mainly electricity but can also achieve orientated deposition of fibers for rapid hemostasis are highly desired.|$|R
40|$|Minimally {{invasive}} {{abdominal surgery}} (laparoscopy) {{is performed using}} long, slender instruments inserted through multiple small incisions in the patient's abdominal wall. This results in less post [...] operative pain, shorter hospital stays, and a quicker return to normal activities for the patient compared to conventional open surgery; however, the use of small entry incisions provides only limited access to the surgical site compared to conventional open surgery. Robotic systems have been developed that overcome some limitations with laparoscopic surgery. The systems, however, are very high cost, provide limited benefit to the patient, and do not completely address limited access issues {{and the need for}} multiple incisions. New techniques, such as single [...] port laparoscopic and natural orifice surgery, reduce the number of entry incisions but still provide only limited access to the surgical site. An innovative solution that potentially overcomes both limitations is to insert miniature robotic assistants entirely inside the abdominal cavity through a single incision where they can be readily relocated as needed. Previous work has demonstrated that a family of fixed [...] base and modular, wireless, intracorporeal, mobile robots can successfully monitor physiological conditions, perform biopsies, staple and clamp tissue, and provide visual feedback within the abdominal cavity. Current robots do not have the ability to store or dispense liquids such as hemostatic agents. The use of hemostatic agents, such as <b>fibrin</b> <b>sealants,</b> instead of mechanical or electrical means of hemostasis alleviates the extensive training required for laparoscopic suturing, the nerve damage accompanying staples or tacks, and the need for a relatively large energy source for electrocautery tools and harmonic scalpels.

Included in this development is a method for mixing two liquids stored inside the robot as they are dispensed, which is needed for dual compound liquids such as <b>fibrin</b> <b>sealants.</b> Finally, two improvements to the design of the control electronics are presented that allow for more rapid robot deployment and provide the ability for point of use changes to the embedded control software...|$|R
30|$|In recent years, {{laparoscopy}} {{has become}} {{the gold standard for}} the treatment of ovarian endometriotic cysts [10, 11]. Laparoscopic stripping is the most preferred procedure [6]. Good haemostasis is important after laparoscopic stripping of the cyst wall, and techniques like bipolar coagulation, sutures, <b>fibrin</b> <b>sealants</b> and direct pressure are used [8]. Bipolar coagulation of the ovarian stroma is effective but damages the healthy ovarian tissue. When the ovarian capsule is left open after bipolar coagulation, it is associated with more adhesions as compared to the reconstruction of the ovary [12]. In contrast, sutures are useful but also cause additional damage to the healthy tissue [13]. Though suturing technique has been shown to cause less adhesions as compared to bipolar coagulation by various studies, sutures cause more postoperative adhesions as seen in the myomectomy studies and suturing is technically more demanding [7, 14]. Thus, avoiding suturing will be a simpler technique for the reconstruction. In this study, we used compression with bowel grasper for ovarian reconstruction after laparoscopic cystectomy of endometrioma.|$|R
