40|$|Exorbitant {{territorial}} jurisdiction in civil cases comprises those classes of jurisdiction, although exercised validly under a country 2 ̆ 7 s rules, that nonetheless are {{unfair to the}} defendant {{because of a lack}} of significant connection between the sovereign and either the parties or the dispute. The United States, France, and most of the rest of the world exercise a good deal of <b>exorbitant</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> so defined. In the United States, an emphasis on power derived from territoriality has led to jurisdictional restraint in some respects, but has also allowed general jurisdiction based solely on transient physical presence, the attachment of property, or extensive business activities unrelated to the cause of action. In contrast, the civil law 2 ̆ 7 s emphasis on fairness has kept France from developing these exorbitant bases of jurisdiction, but has failed to restrain it from asserting general jurisdiction based solely on the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s nationality. A number of other countries have added some wrinkles to their own brands of <b>exorbitant</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> We conclude (1) that although the extent, details, and phrasing of the world 2 ̆ 7 s exorbitant bases of jurisdiction differ among nations, there appears to be a common core in the nations 2 ̆ 7 urge to disregard defendants 2 ̆ 7 interests in order to give their own people a way to sue at home, when the forum country will be able to enforce the resulting judgment locally, and (2) that even though <b>exorbitant</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> is thus understandable, the ultimate goal should remain its elimination by international agreement...|$|E
40|$|French {{courts have}} broadly read their Civil Code’s oddly written Article 14 as authorizing {{territorial}} jurisdiction over virtually any action brought by a plaintiff of French nationality. This study traces {{the history of}} this provision from its genesis two hundred years ago to its extension under the current Brussels Regulation. Nevertheless, for a number of reasons, French plaintiffs do not use Article 14 all that much, other than in status suits such as matrimonial matters or in situations where the defendant has assets in France (or now, under the Brussels regime, in Europe). The actual use of Article 14 ends up being not all that different from what other countries have accomplished in other ways, such as the United States by its nonpersonal attachment jurisdiction or Germany by its property-based personal jurisdiction. Each country’s <b>exorbitant</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> constitutes a way to allow its own people to sue at home when they can enforce the judgment at home, which is usually so much easier than suing abroad. So one could argue that, being essentially similar to all the other countries’ exorbitances, Article 14 mainly sounds bad, because it is more nationalistic in expressing who can invoke it and because it does not utilize the subterfuge of expressly linking to property in France or to any other defendant contact with France. But in fact Article 14 has more extensive effects than its limited invocation suggests, lurking in the background of numerous filed cases and threatened cases. The future poses the risk of ever more extensive pernicious effects. International conventions should therefore aim at eliminating Article 14, like any other <b>exorbitant</b> <b>jurisdiction...</b>|$|E
40|$|International forum {{shopping}} in disputes on liability {{can be a}} legitimate procedural strategy for plaintiffs in looking for a favourable jurisdiction. But it demands careful consideration of the pros and cons. In particular, {{the assumption that the}} selected court will prefer its own law in any case is not always honoured. The true (and more reliable) motives for {{forum shopping}} are aiming at the procedural climate in the selected forum state that seems favourable to the plaintiff (in the case of U. S. courts: jury trial, pre-trial discovery, and class actions). The defendant has but a limited number of remedies and procedural tactics to react upon the claimant’s forum shopping or anticipate it – which requires imagination and skilful reflection of all the conceivable steps to be taken by the plaintiff: ADR, anti-suit injunctions (only rarely available in continental Europe, however), declaratory actions for denial, torpedo suits, and, sometimes, the forum-non-conveniens objection. In order to keep undue excesses in forum shopping under control, it seems necessary that the international community, too, in conventions and treaties, agrees on reducing the choices and on banning <b>exorbitant</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> in national laws...|$|R
50|$|Article 4 {{also allows}} a person {{domiciled}} in any member state {{to take advantage}} of another member state's <b>exorbitant</b> bases of <b>jurisdiction</b> on the same basis as a national of that state. This is useful in cases where a member state, such as France, allows its nationals to sue anyone in their courts, so that someone domiciled in a member state like Finland may sue someone domiciled in a non-member state like Canada, in the courts of a third party member state, like France, where the defendant may have assets.|$|R
