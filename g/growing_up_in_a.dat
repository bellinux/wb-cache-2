When he was nine, he was diagnosed with juvenile arthritis and needed to use a wheelchair, which he later overcame. As a teenager, he attended Marie-Esther Secondary, where he was a straight-A student. <b>Growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fishing town, he worked summers on his uncle's crab fishing boat.|$|E

40|$|This {{exploratory}} study compared selected HIV/STD-related risk variables (sexual behavior, condom use, STD diagnosis, and beliefs) between adults who <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rural area {{and those who}} <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-rural area. Participants were recruited through an electronic mailing list of a large, internet-based sexual enhancement product company and completed a web-based questionnaire. A sample comprising 123 rural {{men and women and}} 1131 non–rural men and women, ages 18 to 39 years, were analyzed. No significant differences were found for any of the variables between those who <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rural area compared to those who <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-rural area, although both groups reported HIV/STD risk behaviors. Hence, prevention education efforts appear justified in rural, as well urban area...|$|R

5|$|Despite <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> slaveholding area, Daniel was an {{abolitionist}} {{and joined}} with the majority at the convention in voting to outlaw slavery and disenfranchise those who had fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. In 1866, Daniel argued in court that state laws enforcing racial distinctions were no longer valid {{after the passage of}} the recent federal Civil Rights Act. The court ruled in his favor, holding that the law could not treat black and white apprentices differently. Later that year, Daniel ran unsuccessfully for a judgeship on the state equity court.|$|E
5|$|According to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, {{the themes}} of {{alienation}} and persecution, although present in Kafka's work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka's work is more deliberate and subversive—and more joyful—than may first appear. They point out that reading the Kafka work while focusing on the futility of his characters' struggles reveals Kafka's play of humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, absurd worlds. Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer Milan Kundera suggests that Kafka's surrealist humour {{may have been an}} inversion of Dostoyevsky's presentation of characters who are punished for a crime. In Kafka's work a character is punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka's inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> patriarchal family and living in a totalitarian state.|$|E
5|$|The East End {{has been}} the subject of {{parliamentary}} commissions and other examinations of social conditions since the 19th century, as seen in Henry Mayhew's London Labour and the London Poor (1851) and Charles Booth's Life and Labour of the People in London (third, expanded edition 1902-3, in 17 volumes). Arthur Morrison's novel A Child of the Jago (1896) is set in Bethnal Green, and recounts the story of a boy <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> slum surrounding Arnold Circus. Narrative accounts of experiences amongst the East End poor were also written by Jack London in The People of the Abyss (1903), by George Orwell in parts of his novel Down and Out in Paris and London, recounting his own experiences in the 1930s, as well as the Jewish writer Emanuel Litvinoff in his autobiographical novel Journey Through a Small Planet set in the 1930s. A further detailed study of Bethnal Green was carried out in the 1950s by sociologists Michael Young and Peter Willmott, in Family and Kinship in East London.|$|E

5|$|After {{his parents}} {{separated}} {{when he was}} ten, Beck stayed {{with his mother and}} brother in Los Angeles, where he was influenced by the city's diverse musical offerings—everything from hip hop to Latin music and his mother's art scene—all of which would later reappear in his recorded and published work. Beck obtained his first guitar at 16 and became a street musician, often playing Lead Belly covers at Lafayette Park. During his teens, Beck discovered the music of Sonic Youth, Pussy Galore and X, but remained uninterested in most music outside folk until many years into his career. The first contemporary music that made a direct connection with Beck was hip hop, which he first heard on Grandmaster Flash records in the early 1980s. <b>Growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> predominantly Latin district, he found himself the only white child at his school, and he quickly learned to breakdance. When he was 17, Beck grew fascinated after hearing a Mississippi John Hurt record at a friend's house, and spent hours in his room trying to emulate the country-blues guitarist's finger picking techniques. Shortly thereafter, Beck explored blues and folk music further, discovering Woody Guthrie and Blind Willie Johnson.|$|E

25|$|As a {{young man}} <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{conservative}} church, it felt impossible to deal with issues around my own sexuality.

25|$|A {{common theme}} in his fiction {{is that of}} men being sucked into a circle of crime {{at a very young}} age and <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> vicious world where {{authorities}} are at worst cruel and at best incompetent and ineffectual, and those stuck in the system can be either abusers or helpless victims, regardless of whether they're in jail or outside.

25|$|As a deaf from birth, and <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{time when}} no {{standardized}} sign language {{for the deaf}} existed, the young Brewster probably interacted with few people outside of the circle {{of his family and}} friends, with whom he would have learned to communicate.
