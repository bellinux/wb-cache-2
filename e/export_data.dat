25|$|In 2007, foreign experts {{working on}} behalf of the United Nations said that the {{historically}} low levels of transparency and continued denial of full investigations to international monitors have reinforced negative perceptions of the Transnistrian government, although recent co-operation by Transnistrian authorities may have reflected a shift in the attitude of Transnistria. Their report stated that the evidence for the illicit production and trafficking of weapons into and from Transnistria, has in the past been exaggerated, although the trafficking of light weapons is likely to have occurred before 2001 (the last year when <b>export</b> <b>data</b> showed US$900,000 worth of 'weapons, munitions, their parts and accessories' exported from Transnistria). The report also states that {{the same holds true for}} the production of such weapons, which is likely to have been carried out in the 1990s, primarily to equip Transnistrian forces.|$|E
25|$|The website {{supports}} drag-and-drop capabilities, one-click editing, plain-language event adding, as well {{as unique}} features aimed towards social networkers. Calendars can contain feeds from Twitter, Blogger, MySpace, Facebook, WordPress, Vox, and Upcoming.org, which generates a social timeline listing all of a user's recent online activity. Users can also import and <b>export</b> <b>data</b> as ics or csv files, or as an RSS feed. The website includes a plain-language event adding feature, which allows users to type phrases such as “Drinks with Richard, tomorrow, 7-9pm, Flute and Whistle”. The website then translates the phrase into an event, determining the location, time, date, and description. Users can add buddies and share calendars with them. 30 Boxes features a simple webtop, which summarizes daily appointments and to-do items. Users can also add applets to the page, such as Google search, Yahoo! Mail, and Google Calendar, a competing online calendar service. 30 Boxes also offers a mobile version of their calendar.|$|E

Over this same period, 47% of the US turtle exports went to the People's Republic of China (predominantly to Hong Kong), another 20% to Taiwan, and 11% to Mexico.|$|E
