5|$|The {{two main}} {{determinants}} {{of the position}} of the PPF at any given time are the state of technology and management expertise (which are reflected in the available production functions) and the available quantities of <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> (materials, direct labor, and factory overhead).|$|E
5|$|For example, if {{one assumes}} that the economy's {{available}} quantities of <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> do not change over time and that technological progress does not occur, if the economy is operating on the PPF, production of guns {{would need to be}} sacrificed to produce more butter. If production is efficient, the economy can choose between combinations (points) on the PPF: B if guns are of interest, C if more butter is needed, D if an equal mix of butter and guns is required.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of the FairTax {{argue that}} {{imposing}} a national retail sales tax would drive transactions underground {{and create a}} vast underground economy. Under a retail sales tax system, the purchase of intermediate goods and services that are <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> are not taxed, since those goods would produce a final retail good that would be taxed. Individuals and businesses {{may be able to}} manipulate the tax system by claiming that purchases are for intermediate goods, when in fact they are final purchases that should be taxed. Proponents point out that a business is required to have a registered seller's certificate on file, and must keep complete records of all transactions for six years. Businesses must also record all taxable goods bought for seven years. They are required to report these sales every month (see Personal vs. business purchases). The government could also stipulate that all retail sellers provide buyers with a written receipt, regardless of transaction type (cash, credit, etc.), which would create a paper trail for evasion with risk of having the buyer turn them in (the FairTax authorizes a reward for reporting tax cheats).|$|E

30|$|As {{previously}} stated, {{this article}} regards the familial factor as a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> Family involvement is then an input for this <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> Based on agent theory and resource-based theory, {{we believe that}} in private businesses the marginal agent costs and marginal revenues of family involvement differ by different business scales. Therefore, the relationship between family involvement and business performance may exhibit different patterns according to different sizes of businesses.|$|R
25|$|Wieser {{based his}} theory of {{imputation}} {{on the assumption that}} <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> are combined in fixed proportions in each industry, but at different rates in different industries. It {{was one of the first}} mathematical solutions to the problem of determining the prices of <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E
25|$|Relative endowments of the <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> (land, labor, and capital) {{determine}} a country's comparative advantage. Countries have comparative advantages in those goods {{for which the}} required <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> are relatively abundant locally. This is because the profitability of goods is determined by input costs. Goods that require inputs that are locally abundant are cheaper to produce than those goods that require inputs that are locally scarce.|$|E
25|$|When {{the amount}} of one factor of {{production}} increases, {{the production of the}} good that uses that particular production factor intensively increases relative to the increase in the factor of production, as the H–O model assumes perfect competition where price is equal to the costs of <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> This theorem is useful in explaining the effects of immigration, emigration, and foreign capital investment. However, Rybczynski suggests that a fixed quantity of the two <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> are required. This could be expanded to consider factor substitution, in which case the increase in production is more than proportional.|$|E

25|$|The law of {{diminishing}} marginal utility {{is similar to}} the law {{of diminishing}} returns which states that as the amount of one factor of production increases as all other <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> are held the same, the marginal return (extra output gained by adding an extra unit) decreases.|$|E
25|$|Inputs {{used in the}} {{production}} process include such primary <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> as labour services, capital (durable produced goods used in production, such as an existing factory), and land (including natural resources). Other inputs may include intermediate goods used in production of final goods, such as the steel in a new car.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of keiretsu: {{vertical}} and horizontal. Vertical keiretsu illustrates the organization and relationships within a company (for example all <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> of a certain product are connected), while a horizontal keiretsu shows relationships between entities and industries, normally centered on a bank and trading company. Both are complexly woven together and sustain each other.|$|E

5000|$|Closely {{associated}} {{with the concept of}} cultural inheritance as a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> is the social credit theory of economic sabotage. While Douglas believed the cultural heritage <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> is primary in increasing wealth, he also believed that economic sabotage is the primary factor decreasing it. The word wealth derives from the Old English word wela, or [...] "well-being", and Douglas believed that all production should increase personal well-being. Therefore, production that does not directly increase personal well-being is waste, or economic sabotage.|$|R
25|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} is {{an approach to}} economics focusing on the determination of goods, outputs, and income distributions in markets through supply and demand. This determination is often mediated through a hypothesized maximization of utility by income-constrained individuals and of profits by firms facing production costs and employing available information and <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> in accordance with rational choice theory.|$|E
25|$|Some economists of the Austrian School {{maintained}} {{that the value of}} the <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> is not the individual contribution of each factor in the final product, but rather the value of the most valuable use that can be made of the last good (the marginal utility before reaching the Pareto optimal point.) The opposing view held by the Classical School in Adam Smith is the labor theory of value.|$|E
25|$|George {{reconciled}} {{the issues}} of efficiency and equity, showing that both could be satisfied under a system in harmony with natural law. He showed that Ricardo's Law of Rent applied not just to an agricultural economy, but even more so to urban economics.

40|$|The simple Ricardian model {{explains}} the comparative cost advantage by a relative productivity advantage <b>of</b> the single <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> This model is tested {{in this paper}} using microdata of the german business survey. In a first approach labour is being {{considered to be the}} only <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> whereas in a second one capital is analysed. The results show that the former is able to explain the pattern of trade whereas the latter has no explanatory power. Therefore, labour productivity is a decisive determinant as to whether a commodity will be exported or not...|$|R
50|$|The {{marginal}} product <b>of</b> a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> {{is generally}} {{defined as the}} change in output associated with a change in that factor, holding other inputs into production constant.|$|R
25|$|The {{assumption}} of constant {{returns to scale}} CRS is useful because it exhibits a diminishing returns in a factor. Under constant returns to scale, doubling both capital and labor leads to a doubling of the output. Since outputs are increasing in both <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> doubling capital while holding labor constant leads to less than doubling of an output. Diminishing returns to capital and diminishing returns to labor are crucial to the Stolper–Samuelson theorem.|$|E
25|$|The Heckscher–Ohlin model (H–O model) is {{a general}} {{equilibrium}} mathematical model of international trade, developed by Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin at the Stockholm School of Economics. It builds on David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage by predicting patterns of commerce and production based on the factor endowments of a trading region. The model essentially says that countries export products that use their abundant and cheap <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> and import products that use the countries' scarce factors.|$|E
25|$|Educational {{attainment}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} prominent determinants of class status. As educational attainment represents expertise, which is a necessary component of the capitalist market system, its ownership may be seen as the ownership of one of the <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> In other words, those with advanced degrees already own one of the essential buttresses of the economy: expertise. Additionally educational attainment is basis for occupational selection. Those with higher educational attainment tend to be positioned in occupations with greater autonomy, influence over the organizational process, and better financial compensation.|$|E

40|$|Regarding {{the other}} {{development}} projects within an economy, the mining projects (objectified in underground exploitation, day-light exploitation and preparing enterprises) presents specific characters, such as: a great {{volume of the}} capital investment; important loss by stopping the invested capital; long period of recouping the invested capital; small rates of profit (or even absent); increased intensity of using the capital <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> production; high value of specific investment. A simple review of these elements determines their contact to the “capital” <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> Under these circumstances the given work tries to catch the particular aspects of using the “capital” <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> in the mining branch...|$|R
50|$|Free trade means free {{production}}. Now {{fully to}} free production {{it is necessary}} not only to remove all taxes on production, but also to remove all other restrictions on production. True free trade, in short, requires that the active <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> Labor, shall have free access to the passive <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> Land. To secure this all monopoly of land must be broken up, and the equal right of all {{to the use of}} the natural elements must be secured by the treatment of the land as the common property in usufruct of the whole people.|$|R
25|$|Given that {{a factor}} {{is used in}} the {{production}} of a range of first-order goods, its value is determined by the good that is worth the least among all the goods in the range. This value is determined at the margin, the marginal utility of the last unit of the least valuable good produced by the factor. In connection with his opportunity cost, the value so derived represents an opportunity cost across all industries, and the values of the <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and goods are determined in the whole system. Thus, supply and demand do not develop into the determinants of value; the determinant of value is the marginal utility.|$|E
25|$|On {{the supply}} side of the market, some <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> are {{described}} as (relatively) variable in the short run, which affects the cost of changing output levels. Their usage rates can be changed easily, such as electrical power, raw-material inputs, and over-time and temp work. Other inputs are relatively fixed, such as plant and equipment and key personnel. In the long run, all inputs may be adjusted by management. These distinctions translate to differences in the elasticity (responsiveness) of the supply curve in the short and long runs and corresponding differences in the price-quantity change from a shift on the supply or demand side of the market.|$|E
25|$|Previously, some economists, such as Carl Menger {{and others}} of the Austrian School, {{maintained}} {{that the value of}} <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> is the individual contribution of each in the final product, but its value is the value of the last contributed to the final product (the marginal utility before reaching the point Pareto optimal). Thus, Wieser identified a flaw in the theory of imputation as expounded by his teacher, Carl Menger: overvaluation may occur if one is confronted with economies where profits jump (maximums and minimums in his utility function, where its second derivative equals 0). Wieser thus suggested as an alternative the simultaneous solution of a system of industrial equations.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{concomitant}} claims that agricultural land {{can be regarded}} as a fixed <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and that rents derived from government policies accrue only to landowners. Characteristics of the long-run, equilibrium relation between farmland rental payments and government policies reveal whether farmland is a fixed <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> Examining whether these variables are cointegrated shows {{the extent to which the}} claims are true. Further, examining returns rather than directly examining asset price movements gives us a precise test, unencumbered by expectations hypotheses. Our results show that policy-derived rents accrue to landowners, rather than to farmers. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} Hecksher-Ohlin model {{predicts that}} trade liberalization {{leads to a}} decline in the rate of return <b>of</b> the scarce <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> However, the empirical evidence of the falling labor share in some developing countries contrasts with the theory. We show that if a simple change in technology is introduced into the standard model, conditions exist for the rate of return <b>of</b> the scarce <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> to increase. In particular, the price of the exported good and the amount of capital the country owns can serve as determinants whether the rate of return <b>of</b> the abundant <b>factor</b> will increase...|$|R
40|$|Total factor {{productivity}} growth (TFPG) has been traditionally associated with technological change. We show {{that when a}} <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> such as energy, generates an environmental externality {{in the form of}} CO 2 emissions which is not internalized because of lack of environmental policy, then TFPG estimates could be biased. This is because the contribution of environment as a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> is not accounted for in the growth accounting framework. Empirical estimates confirm this hypothesis and suggest that part of what is regarded as technology’s contribution to growth could be attributed to the use of environment in output production.
