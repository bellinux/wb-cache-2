30|$|The {{development}} of advanced <b>inverter</b> <b>technologies</b> {{over the last}} thirty years has allowed both PV and wind technologies to be easily integrated into AC electrical grids, however they do have different characteristics from synchronous generators and therefore have unique challenges with this integration [5]. One difference is the inherent inertia that a large rotating mass from a synchronous generator can provide. This rotating inertia helps synchronous generators ride through voltage and frequency deviations in the grid caused by abnormal operations such as a fault. As more synchronous generators in a power system are replaced by inverter based VRE, the inverters will {{need to be able to}} provide “synthetic” inertia that mimics the characteristics of synchronous generators. Current power electronics can be designed to provide this as well as a large array of ancillary services that are needed to support reliable grid operations [6, 7, 8].|$|R

40|$|Transformerless <b>inverters</b> <b>technology</b> in {{photovoltaic}} systems offers many advantages, {{but there are}} some safety issues due to the solar panel parasitic capacitance. The parasitic capacitance value depends on many factors such as PV panels and frame structure, surface of the cells, distance between the cells, module frame, weather conditions (e. g., humidity) and the amount of dust covering the PV panel. Harsh climate like the one in the Central Queensland region is characterized by high temperature, high relative humidity. Due to the region’s high dew point, high humidity and heavy rain during the wet season, the water condensed over the PV array surface will affect the stray capacitance significantly and consequently, the system leakage current. Human safety in PV system is a key issue, which must be addressed when this technology is applied. Protection against electrical shock is essential while deploying such systems to avoid injury or loss of life. Furthermore, PV insulation varies with meteorological conditions such as, temperatures, humidity. Therefore, the protective circuit should have the capability to adapt to any changes in metrological variables.

These do not only relate to safety, but also to economics, especially of smaller systems. AC modules are especially interesting to use for the integration into buildings, as the independent operation of AC modules prevents that a whole PV system will function poorly due to shading of only one PV module. Research and development into AC module inverters started in the early nineties. The development efforts have resulted in AC module inverters ranging from 100 to 250 Watts. The available inverters are all more or less mature. Currently {{we are in the}} stage of market introduction. Larger projects are being executed to gain data about the inverters in the field. Besides safety standards are being developed in order to guarantee safe operation of the inverters. Future developments of AC modules will focus on lowering the price. At this moment AC modules are considered price competitive with traditional PV systems up to 700 Watts. Due to economies of scale AC modules will become competitive for rooftops of about 20 PV modules (2000 Watts).

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2008. Low Cost Automation (LCA) is {{of immense}} {{importance}} to industry, {{and even more}} so for small scale industries. In implementing LCA determining cost effective and efficient actuator alternatives present challenges for design engineers. Most often decisions are experiential or entirely based on manufacturer recommendations. Experience based decisions are most often biased with respect to the engineers’ knowledge. Similarly, manufacturer recommendations are restricted to their own products and are as such also biased. Either way, sub-optimum drive alternatives may sometimes be chosen. This demonstrates the need for making better informed decisions based on more than experience and what is available for use. This thesis reports the development of an electric actuator selection procedure and aid for use in the early layout design phase. It provides readily accessible information on technically viable actuator options. Experiential knowledge of experts in the field, commercial information, as well as data obtained from experimentation was used in its development. Being orientated towards LCA, the procedure has been targeted at the application of electric motors and their associated control technologies but can be extended to hydraulic, pneumatic and other actuators. In achieving a wider applicability of the selection aid, a generic set of actuator properties descriptive of most actuators was formulated. An AC drives control evaluation was conducted for developing the selection procedure and aid. It provided a means to validate some selection aid rules associated with actuator controllability. Quantitative data on speed and positioning accuracies of common AC three phase motors and their associated <b>inverter</b> <b>technologies</b> were the targeted results of the experimentation...|$|R

40|$|Inextricably, {{generation}} of electricity is balanced with respect to consumption. Conventionally, electricity is generated in response to demand. The integration or renewable energy sources poses challenges to {{the operation of the}} power system and increases the demand for flexibility. Part of the solution is to improve the flexibility of generators and consumers. Next, storage technology can be used to match supply and demand in time, by storing the electric energy in the meanwhile. Finally, the grid also represents a source of flexibility. By connecting generators and consumers through the transmission and distribution infrastructure, matching of supply and demand is improved. This dissertation deals with the complementarity of power grids and storage. The storage of electricity represents a combination of three functions: consuming electricity, accumulating the energy in some form, and finally generating electricity again. Pumped hydro storage is by large the most common storage technology in the grid today. Other storage technologies are often discussed. Secondary batteries convert electrical to chemical energy and back. Such batteries are used in battery energy storage systems, which can be designed and operated to perform services to support the grid. This dissertation first discusses a set of mature battery storage technologies, and a number of feasibility issues of such systems in the distribution grid is discussed. Secondly, optimization models for storage systems are proposed, and results are calculated for case studies of realistic distribution grids. A first model deals with the combination of storage with photovoltaic generation, to mitigate the impact on the medium-voltage grid. Next, generation-source neutral approaches are developed. Here, battery storage is used to mitigate voltage and power issues in low-voltage distribution grids.

The electrical model of the IBDER is completely dependent on the control strategy implemented in the inverter. When a fault occurs in the system, IBDER switches to a current-limiting mode with a predefined current limit [15, 16, 17]. Controllers are set either to inject only positive sequence currents or (less often) to control both positive and negative sequence currents, while zero sequence currents are always blocked [15, 16, 17]. The current limit is predefined and integrated in the inverter, and does not exceed 1.5 times the rated currents. Thus, for IBDERs the traditional models represented by ideal voltage sources behind impedances are completely inadequate and cannot be used in any case. This is also discussed in Section  4.2 {{as well as in the}} results section.|$|R
