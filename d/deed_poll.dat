5|$|During the war, Hammond {{spent much}} of his leave with Ness-Harvey in South Africa. In 1945, she {{followed}} him back to England, but did not like it. When Hammond left to tour Australia in 1946–47, Ness-Harvey remained behind with his mother, with whom she did not get along. This was one of the factors which led to Hammond's problems on the tour.

5000|$|Name {{blending}} or meshing is {{the practice}} of combining two existing names {{to form a new}} name. An example is the combination of the surnames Dresser and McLoughlin to form the new surname of game designer Clay Dreslough. It is most commonly performed upon marriage. According to Western tradition, the wife normally adopts the husband's surname upon marriage. Name blending is an alternative practice that attempts to assign equal cultural value to each partner's surname. In November 2012 it was reported that 800 couples in the United Kingdom had opted to blend their surnames thus far that year, primarily among [...] "younger couples in their twenties or early thirties", with this being a leading reason for the issuance of <b>Deed</b> <b>Polls</b> to change names.|$|R
25|$|There is no {{requirement}} that either party must change their surname upon entering a civil partnership. However, many couples wish to follow marital traditions {{and seek to}} change their surname to that of either partner, or combine their names to make a double-barrelled surname. This change can be made after the civil partnership is registered, and authorities will accept a certificate of civil partnership as evidence of name change, e.g. when applying for a passport or a driving licence. In Scotland, names need not be changed to be considered valid (<b>deeds</b> <b>poll</b> do not exist under Scots law), though some English-based companies may still ask for proof from an official such as a Justice of the Peace. Civil partners of male peers or knights do not receive a courtesy title to which the spouse of a peer or knight would be entitled.|$|R
5|$|The Duke of Windsor married Simpson, who {{had changed}} her name by <b>deed</b> <b>poll</b> to Wallis Warfield, in a private {{ceremony}} on 3 June 1937, at Château de Candé, near Tours, France. When the Church of England refused to sanction the union, a County Durham clergyman, the Reverend Robert Anderson Jardine (Vicar of St Paul's, Darlington), offered to perform the ceremony, and the Duke accepted. The new king, George VI, forbade {{members of the royal}} family to attend, to the lasting resentment of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Edward had particularly wanted his brothers the Dukes of Gloucester and Kent and his second cousin Louis Mountbatten to attend the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to change one's coat of arms, with or without adopting or appending a new surname, by Royal Licence, {{that is to say}} a licence {{in the form of a}} warrant from the Crown directed to the Kings of Arms instructing them to exemplify the transferred arms or a version of them to the licensee in his or her new name. Royal Licences are issued on the advice of Garter King of Arms and are usually dependent on there being some constraining circumstances such as a testamentary injunction (a requirement in a will) or a good reason to wish to perpetuate a particular coat of arms. The Royal Licence is of no effect until and unless the exemplification is issued and recorded in the College. Royal Licences are gazetted and make a <b>deed</b> <b>poll</b> unnecessary.|$|E

She left the house to huge cheers and a lively crowd chanting her name.|$|E

25|$|David M. Scienceman is an Australian scientist; {{he changed}} his name from David Slade by <b>deed</b> <b>poll</b> in 1972.

25|$|While {{working at}} the Victorian Guardian newspaper, he wrote a weekly column under the name Jim Crawford. In 1940, he adopted the name 'Jim Crawford' by <b>deed</b> <b>poll</b> as he became {{well-known}} through his weekly column. In the same year, Crawford had to go underground when the Australian Government outlawed the Communist Party. Because the Victorian Guardian Newspaper wrote about Communist issues, it was also prohibited. Crawford wrote illegal newspapers in Communist follower's basements. His friend Cecil Sharpley used to deliver the supplies. As Crawford was still involved with the illegal newspaper he was continuously {{on the run from}} the police. Towards {{the end of the war}} he discovered that Sharpley was the one who exposed his involvement with the newspaper.

He was appointed as the YMCA's musical organiser for the Near East, based in Salonica.|$|E
