We observe that the <b>influence</b> of community including multiple users outweighs the individual <b>influence.</b> Existing models focus on the individual <b>influence</b> analysis, but few studies estimate the community <b>influence</b> that is ubiquitous in online social network. A major challenge lies in that researchers need {{to take into account}} many factors, such as user <b>influence,</b> social trust, and user relationship, to model community-level <b>influence.</b> In this paper, aiming to assess the community-level <b>influence</b> effectively and accurately, we formulate the problem of modeling community <b>influence</b> and construct a community-level <b>influence</b> analysis model. It first eliminates the zombie fans and then calculates the user <b>influence.</b> Next, it calculates the user final <b>influence</b> by combining the user <b>influence</b> and the willingness of diffusing theme information. Finally, it evaluates the community <b>influence</b> by comprehensively studying the user final <b>influence,</b> social trust, and relationship tightness between intrausers of communities. To handle real-world applications, we propose a community-level <b>influence</b> analysis algorithm called CIAA.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{behavior}} of cultural <b>influence</b> networks over time, using a computer simulation based on a formal model of cultural transmission in organizations. In the formal model, every organizational member exerts some cultural <b>influence</b> on, and is <b>influenced</b> by, every other member; these <b>influence</b> paths constitute a dense social network and the weights of paths (ties) vary throughout the network. Over time, each organizational member's enculturation level changes in response to <b>influence</b> from other members, and the <b>influence</b> weight of each path changes {{in relationship to the}} cultural similarity of the individuals connected by the path. Virtual experiments explore the configuration and evolution of the cultural <b>influence</b> network under varying demographic conditions and <b>influence</b> principles. Demographic effects are studied by varying organizational size, hiring selectivity and turnover rates. Two principles for determining initial <b>influence</b> path weights are examined, cohort-based <b>influence</b> and random <b>influence.</b> The simulations show that the cultural <b>influence</b> network evolves over time to a robust configuration, fluctuating around a stable dynamic equilibrium as individuals enter and leave the organization. As turnover rates rise, cohort-based <b>influence</b> strengthens the <b>influence</b> network and reduces network inequality. In this model, cohort-based <b>influence</b> processes promote cultural stability in organizations. ...|$|R

We develop hypotheses that postulate parental <b>influence,</b> and, based on conflicting views of sibling similarity in the recent behavioral genetics and developmental psychology literature, set competing hypotheses about sibling <b>influence</b> on innovativeness and innovative behavior.
