50|$|Indirect {{fixtures}} direct most {{of their}} luminous flux upward toward a ceiling. A highly reflective ceiling can then serve as a secondary source of diffusive, low luminance, high visual quality lighting for interior spaces. The primary advantages of indirect lighting are the opportunity to significantly reduce <b>indirect</b> <b>glare</b> potential and to completely eliminate direct source viewing.|$|E
40|$|Aim of the study: To {{evaluate}} {{influence of}} work with computer on pupils health and ergonomical conditions at their workplaces. Material and methods: Data has been collected by questionnaire testing of 402 pupils at Kaunas and Kretinga secondary schools. Research {{data were analyzed using}} program SPSS 11. 0 for Windows. Results: Working with computer, 30. 3 % of pupils feel pain in eyes, 30. 1 % suffer from reduced vision. Pupils feel uncomfortable because of glare and flicker of display. Children who feel display flicker and discomfort for <b>indirect</b> <b>glare</b> more often complain for visual problems. Children often working with computer in the dark environment more often are feeling redness in eyes. Workplaces at home are equipped better than at school (p 0. 05). Children that have elbow-rests more often feel pain in back (p 0. 05). Conclusions: 1. 	Working with the computer, pupils suffer from vision problems and musculosceletal disorders. 2. 	Statistically reliable difference has been stated between frequency of <b>indirect</b> <b>glare,</b> flicker of the display and pains in the eyes, redness, tearful eyes and reduced vision. 3. 	Pain in musculosceletal system is rare felt by pupils who had properly equipped workplaces. 4. 	Children playing violent games more often had conflicts with their friends (p> 0. 05). Practical recommendations: Assuming the results for prophylaxis of health disturbances, children working with computer should have good work conditions, adjusted furniture, regular rest breaks. Parents and teachers control over computer use is also important. At least once a year children must visit the general practice pediatrician and ophthalmologist for examining their health...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Glare is a {{key factor}} that {{influencing}} the visual performance in light conditions of flight deck, and glare source in flight deck is very complex. It is difficult to directly evaluate the complex glare source, such as non-uniform glare, irregular shape glare and <b>indirect</b> <b>glare</b> using current glare equations. In this paper, a novel method based on SPEOS simulation to predict several types of glare is proposed. Simulation of glare scene is carried out using SPEOS software. Glare source is detected by secondary development on SPEOS. Source luminance, background luminance, position index and solid angle of source are calculated by secondary development as well. And then, the desired glare index can be computed. Finally, Unified Glare Rating(UGR) equation is utilized as an example to predict the glare. The {{results indicate that the}} proposed method can compute glare index automatically and quickly, and is useful in illumination design of flight deck...|$|E
40|$|We {{spend more}} and more time working with computers. When we do so our central visual field lacks {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) features and this leads to reduced binocular control and may result in eye-related symptoms. When other factors such as direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>glare</b> are added to a computer work situation further stress is placed on the visual system and binocular control may be even further reduced and our reading behaviour may also be influenced. These factors are likely to contribute to the vision- and eye symptoms referred to collectively as computer vision syndrome (CVS). Three areas of clinical study are included in the context of using a computer screen for demanding near visual tasks. This research aimed to explore the theoretical relationship between: (1) the importance of centrally placed 3 D features in respect to accommodation and vergence mechanisms; (2) the influence of degraded stimuli and/or degraded retinal image on the quality of binocular vision as an indicator of visual fatigue; (3) the influence of degraded stimuli and/or degraded retinal image on eye movements when reading. Paper I clarified the importance of implementing centrally placed 3 D fixation stimuli to contribute to increase vergence accuracy and fixation stability. Paper II evaluated the influence of disability glare on binocular coordination. The results indicated that binocular coordination increased in instability with the severity of glare and there was a more pronounced effect when lighting condition created direct glare. Paper III described the influence of disability glare on eye movements when reading. It is clear that these eye movements were negatively affected in the direct- and <b>indirect</b> <b>glare</b> lighting conditions. Paper IV evaluated the threshold luminance of direct glare using a subjective response regarding eye symptoms in addition to an evaluation of the effect on binocular coordination as a benchmark. Direct glare of 2000 cd/m 2 was found to decrease the instability of binocular coordination with an increased level of eye pain. In conclusion, these findings argue for a more pronounced relationship between reduced cues of centrally placed 3 D features when working with computers with elevated exposure to disability glare. Direct glare appears to degrade the visibility of the retinal image to such a high degree that it can be identified as the most pronounced inappropriate lighting condition. Evaluation of the luminance threshold of direct glare suggests that it reasonable to recommend that stray light toward the eyes should be significantly lower than 2000 cd/m 2. This research has taken a step in the direction of justifying the importance of following lighting design recommendations in computer work environments...|$|E
