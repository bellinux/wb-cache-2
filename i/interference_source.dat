Jamming may be intentional, as {{with an electronic}} warfare tactic, or unintentional, as with friendly forces operating equipment that transmits using the same frequency range.

In a typical plan position indicator (PPI) radar with a rotating antenna, this will usually be seen as a [...] "sun" [...] or [...] "sunburst" [...] in the centre of the display as the receiver responds to echoes from dust particles and misguided RF in the waveguide. Adjusting the timing between when the transmitter sends a pulse and when the receiver stage is enabled will generally reduce the sunburst without affecting the accuracy of the range, since most sunburst is caused by a diffused transmit pulse reflected before it leaves the antenna. Clutter is considered a passive <b>interference</b> <b>source,</b> since it only appears in response to radar signals sent by the radar.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{flexible}} complexity BF scheme for a multi-user m-MIMO transmission system, {{which is designed}} by considering the trade-off between the implementation complexity and the transmission performance. Unless the power of <b>interference</b> <b>sources</b> to other users is equally distributed, we can achieve the desired performance by removing major <b>interference</b> <b>sources</b> instead of all. We consider {{the use of a}} beam weight determined by the MRT as an initial beam weight. Then, we adjust the beam weight to remove major <b>interference</b> <b>sources</b> generated by the MRT. For ease of implementation, we sequentially adjust the beam weight to remove the interbeam interference in a descending order of interference power. The larger the number of inter-beam <b>interference</b> <b>sources</b> to be removed, the closer performance to that of ZFBF we can get. In practice, m-MIMO antennas may need to be installed in a small space, which may result {{in the presence of a}} high correlation in the m-MIMO channel. When the m-MIMO channel experiences high correlation, the proposed technique can provide performance close to that of ZFBF by only removing a small number of strong <b>interference</b> <b>sources.</b>|$|R

5000|$|FS-FHSS is {{developed}} {{to be applied}} in various wireless communication fields. It is innovated by GONSIN, a Chinese company. It has developed the unique FS-FHSS based on the spread spectrum communication technology. The new technology can monitor and select the undisturbed frequency band. FS-FHSS makes sure {{the stability of the}} communication. It is applied to GONSIN wireless conference system, which implements the discussion、simultaneous interpretation、voting and others comprehensive conference application functions. The feature of FS-FHSS: it uses the 2.4 GHz global frequency band, it does not require certificate. The wireless frequency points are abundant, 80 frequency points could be used; 2.4 GHz has high frequency carrier, the signal diffractivity is relatively weak so that other 2.4 GHz signal could not interfere the conference signal. Adopt FS-FHSS technology, it detect the wireless environment and select the useable frequency point before the conference, during the conference, it hops between the backup frequency points, which can avoid the <b>interference</b> <b>source.</b> It utilizes the efficient digital audio encode and decode technology, one frequency point can transmit 4 channels, it just need two frequency points to transmit 8 channels simultaneous interpretation signals. Because the system occupies relatively less frequency points resource and utilizes the FS-FHSS technology to operate, it can co-work with WIFI and other 2.4 GHz system. It applies the digital audio encryption and digital modulation to avoid any interception and malicious interference; the signal transmitting power could be modified in according with the application occasion, the adjusting range is from 50 meters to 500 meters( [...] the customized system can cover 2,000 meters).|$|E
