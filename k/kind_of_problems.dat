25|$|Closely related {{fields in}} {{theoretical}} computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory. A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity {{theory is that}} the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms {{that could be used to}} solve the same problem. More precisely, computational complexity theory tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources. In turn, imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory: the latter theory asks what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> can, in principle, be solved algorithmically.|$|E
25|$|Graph theory, {{the study}} of graphs and networks, is often {{considered}} part of combinatorics, but has grown large enough and distinct enough, with its own <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems,</b> {{to be regarded as}} a subject in its own right. Graphs are one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics. They are among the most ubiquitous models of both natural and human-made structures. They can model many types of relations and process dynamics in physical, biological and social systems. In computer science, they can represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, the flow of computation, etc. In mathematics, they are useful in geometry and certain parts of topology, e.g. knot theory. Algebraic graph theory has close links with group theory. There are also continuous graphs, however for the most part research in graph theory falls within the domain of discrete mathematics.|$|E

This paper characterizes various {{categories}} of reuse technologies {{in terms of}} their underlying architectures, the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> that they handle well, and the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> that they do not handle well. In the end, it describes their operational envelopes and niches. The emphasis is on generative reuse technologies. ...|$|R

With only 9100 people left {{in the city that}} once had 16,000, then Senator John F. Kennedy made a campaign stop on October 3, 1960. Speaking at the Saline County Court House he said [...] "This district, which is built on the land and which has been nourished by the land, personifies the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> which I think the United States is going to face in the 1960s.

[...] The show advertised the story in a campaign called [...] "Destiny on the Danube". This campaign involved full page ads in magazines. Plans for the shoot began in January 1992 and the desired location was Russia. Former executive producer Felicia Minei Behr said, she [...] "sent a crew in to Russia to see what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> there would be. When {{it became apparent that}} it {{was not going to be}} able to be done because of a lot of recent problems getting shoots done in Russia, we started to look around for different locales. We had this grand story that Megan (McTavish, head writer) and Agnes (Nixon, executive head writer) had written, and we wanted to do it justice." [...] Nixon suggested Budapest as the new location after hearing good things about the city from George Lang, the owner of Café des Artistes, who just opened a restaurant there.|$|E

6000|$|To-night, {{in taking}} up {{the first part of}} the question, I shall {{endeavour}} to put before you a sort of broad notion of our knowledge of the condition of the living world. There are many ways of doing this. I might deal with it pictorially and graphically. Following the example of Humboldt in his [...] "Aspects of Nature," [...] I might endeavour to point out the infinite variety of organic life in every mode of its existence, with reference to the variations of climate and the like; and such an attempt would be fraught with interest to us all; but considering the subject before us, such a course would not be that best calculated to assist us. In an argument of this kind we must go further and dig deeper into the matter; we must endeavour to look into the foundations of living Nature, if I may so say, and discover the principles involved in some of her most secret operations. I propose, therefore, in the first place, to take some ordinary animal with which you are all familiar, and by easily comprehensible and obvious examples drawn from it, to show what are the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> which living beings in general lay before us; and I shall then show you that the same problems are laid open to us by all kinds of living beings. But, first, let me say in what sense I have used the words [...] "organic nature." [...] In speaking of the causes which lead to our present knowledge of organic nature, I have used it almost as an equivalent of the word [...] "living," [...] and for this reason,--that in almost all living beings you can distinguish several distinct portions set apart to do particular things and work in a particular way. These are termed [...] "organs," [...] and the whole together is called [...] "organic." [...] And as it is universally characteristic of them, the term [...] "organic" [...] has been very conveniently employed to denote the whole of living nature,--the whole of the plant world, and the whole of the animal world.|$|E
