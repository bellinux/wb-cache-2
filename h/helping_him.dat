Another, Ethan Iverson, describes Waldron {{as one of}} his biggest influences, and reports having imitated most aspects of the older man's style during his own musical development, through listening to Waldron's recordings.

5|$|Although Ethel made {{a return}} visit to England in 1948 to shop and visit family and friends, Wodehouse never left America {{after his arrival}} in 1947. It was not until 1965 that the British {{government}} indicated privately that he could return without fear of legal proceedings, and by then he felt too old to make the journey.

Henry's son, Edward, initially opposed the revolution, but then allied himself with de Montfort, <b>helping</b> <b>him</b> to pass the radical Provisions of Westminster in 1259, which introduced further limits on the major barons and local royal officials.|$|E
