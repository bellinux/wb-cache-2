500|$|In July 2013, at a {{screening}} of Broadway Idiot, Mayer reported that the film adaptation was still happening, but production had not been scheduled due to [...] "Hollywood bullshit". In March 2014, playwright Rolin Jones told the Hartford Courant that he was writing a new screenplay for the film. Comparing it to the musical, Jones said, [...] "The <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it a little dirtier and a little nastier and translate it into visual terms. There's {{not going to be}} a lot of dialogue and it probably should be a little shorter, too. After that, it just takes its 'movie time' in getting done". He expected to finish it by the end of the month.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{concept for}} Psiphon envisioned an easy-to-use and lightweight Internet proxy, {{designed to be}} installed and operated by individual computer users who would then host private connections for friends and family in countries where the Internet is censored. [...] According to Nart Villeneuve [...] "The <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> (users) to install this on their computer, and then deliver the location of that circumventor, to people in filtered countries by the means they know {{to be the most}} secure. What we're trying to build is a network of trust among people who know each other, rather than a large tech network that people can just tap into." [...] Psiphon 1.0 was launched by the Citizen Lab on 1 December 2006 as open source software.|$|E
60|$|Her {{first and}} {{greatest}} <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{out of this}} room, his private study, with the compromising papers. Not a trace of them must be found here, if he <b>were</b> <b>to</b> remain beyond suspicion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, absolutely! My <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{this book}} and coach the dear old chap. Rehearse him, don't you know. He could bone up the early {{chapters}} a bit and then drift round and try his convincing talk on me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, there isn't {{anything}} more. You {{know how}} Miss Kilburn {{here has been}} round throwing ridicule on Brother Peck, because he wants the shop-hands treated with common decency, and my <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the two together and see how she would feel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a poor invention. It doesn't deceive. Their <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> me {{drunk and}} leave me under the table, and from their {{standpoint}} this will be very funny. But they don't know me. I am familiar with champagne and have no prejudices against it." ...|$|E
60|$|In his {{straddling}} wide forward-step, and his springy side-wise {{series of}} hops, and his impudent air, and his cunning way of canting {{his head to}} one side upon occasion, he reminds one of the American blackbird. But the sharp resemblances stop there. He is much bigger than the blackbird; and he lacks the blackbird's trim and slender and beautiful build and shapely beak; and of course his sober garb of gray and rusty black is a poor and humble thing compared with the splendid lustre of the blackbird's metallic sables and shifting and flashing bronze glories. The blackbird is a perfect gentleman, in deportment and attire, and is not noisy, I believe, except when holding religious services and political conventions in a tree; but this Indian sham Quaker is just a rowdy, and is always noisy when awake--always chaffing, scolding, scoffing, laughing, ripping, and cursing, and carrying on about something or other. I never saw such a bird for delivering opinions. Nothing escapes him; he notices everything that happens, and brings out his opinion about it, particularly if it is a matter that is none of his business. And it is never a mild opinion, but always violent--violent and profane--the presence of ladies does not affect him. His opinions are not the outcome of reflection, for he never thinks about anything, but heaves out the opinion that is on top in his mind, and which is often an opinion about some quite different thing and does not fit the case. But that is his way; his main <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out an opinion, and if he stopped to think he would lose chances.|$|E

5000|$|In 2007 a {{group of}} exiled {{businessmen}} proposed plans for a bloodless coup to remove Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe.

He also wrote about other periods of American history, and wrote over a dozen well-received novels set against various historical backgrounds.

60|$|Sam {{got tired}} of it fust, and {{catching}} Ginger's eye said he thought it <b>was</b> time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> 'ome in case too much enjoyment wasn't good for 'em.

50|$|The show {{features}} {{three or}} four guests and two anchors, the core <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them to share their nostalgic memories besides funny and interesting moments.

5000|$|Gonne {{remained}} {{very active}} in Paris. In 1913, she established L'Irlande Libre a French newspaper. She wanted Cumann na mBan <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered seriously: her <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> affiliation with the English Red Cross, and wrote to Geneva to gain an international profile for the new nationalist organization. [...] In 1918, she was arrested in Dublin and imprisoned in England for six months.|$|R
60|$|Drexley let him go, despising himself, with a vague {{feeling of}} irritation, too, against the {{beautiful}} face which {{smiled at him}} from his table.

50|$|Good cop/bad cop is an {{interrogation}} {{technique in}} which the officers take different sides. The 'bad cop' takes a negative stance on the subject. This allows for the 'good cop' to sympathize with and defend the subject.

Kasparov's <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some breathing room on his queenside and prevent White from playing c2-c4. However, this move has been marked as a mistake by Schwartzman, Seirawan, and Rajlich as it weakens the queenside pawn structure and invites White to open lines.|$|E

We went out last night to look at the jewellers' windows--in that street behind the hotel. I had always heard of those jewellers' windows.

This game allows the player to take care of cats, dogs, rabbits, pigs, and horses. The player of the game starts with an introduction of what you will be doing, and how to get help. The main <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> very well known and heal as many animals as possible. Starting with cats you will examine the different types of animals listed above then heal and return them to their owners. In return, you will gain money and proceed onto your next goal.|$|E

5000|$|Heckling often {{occurs during}} stand up comedy performances, {{particularly}} at open stage performances, and/or where alcoholic beverages are being consumed. It {{is regarded as}} a sign of audience impatience with the low quality of the performance. Some comedians ignore the heckling and dislike the practice. In an interview for a 2011 BBC documentary, Billy Connolly said that [...] "I loathe hecklers. I haven't one good syllable to say about hecklers. When you've come out of the club circuit and all that and you're in the concert hall...they should be gone." [...] Other stand-up comedians devise a strategy for quashing such outbursts, usually by having a store of retorts (known as [...] "squelches") on hand.

My first clear <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from both the women, and consider what <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done next.

50|$|The {{unique set of}} {{frameworks}} and methodologies, {{grew from}} the fact that changes in the world of business were so enormous that existing managerial frameworks had become invalid or incomplete. These huge advancements were caused by the internet. The internet created a huge potential for communication and the incredible technology surrounding e- business and e-commerce enabled completely new business approaches.

So at that time, although it seems odd now, going <b>to</b> Europe <b>was</b> a way of living cheaply.
