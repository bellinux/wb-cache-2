25|$|Jericho's first {{long-term}} feud {{was with}} Chyna, for the Intercontinental Championship. After losing to Chyna at Survivor Series, Jericho defeated her {{to win his}} first Intercontinental Championship at Armageddon. This feud included a controversial decision during a rematch in which two separate referees declared <b>each</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> the winner of a match for the title. As a result, they became co-champions, during which, Jericho turned into a fan favorite. He attained sole champion status at the Royal Rumble.|$|E
25|$|Surface hopping {{accounts}} for these limitations by propagating an ensemble of trajectories, <b>each</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> {{on a single}} adiabatic surface at any given time. The trajectories are allowed to 'hop' between various adiabatic states at certain times such that the quantum amplitudes for the adiabatic states follow the time dependent Schrödinger equation. The probability of these hops are dependent on the coupling between the states, and is generally significant only in the regions where the difference between adiabatic energies is small.|$|E

25|$|In 1786 Tipu Sultan, again {{following}} the lead of his father, decided to build a navy consisting of 20 battleships of 72 cannons and 20 frigates of 62 cannons. In the year 1790 he appointed Kamaluddin as his Mir Bahar and established massive dockyards at Jamalabad and Majidabad. Tipu Sultan's board of admiralty consisted of 11 commanders in service of a Mir Yam. A Mir Yam led 30 admirals and <b>each</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had two ships. By the year 1789 most of Tipu Sultan's ships had copper-bottoms, an idea that increased the longevity of the ships and was introduced to Tipu by Admiral Suffren.|$|E
25|$|In the {{simplest}} case, a single connection is established to an upstream ISP {{and is used}} to transmit data to or from areas of the Internet beyond the home network; this mode of interconnection is often cascaded multiple times until reaching a tier 1 carrier. In reality, the situation is often more complex. ISPs {{with more than one}} point of presence (PoP) may have separate connections to an upstream ISP at multiple PoPs, or they may be customers of multiple upstream ISPs and may have connections to <b>each</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> at one or more point of presence. Transit ISPs provide large amounts of bandwidth for connecting hosting ISPs and access ISPs.|$|E
25|$|Wes Craven {{began writing}} A Nightmare on Elm Street's {{screenplay}} around 1981, {{after he had}} finished production on Swamp Thing (1982). He pitched it to several studios, but <b>each</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> rejected it for different reasons. The first studio to show interest was Walt Disney Productions, although they wanted Craven to tone down the content to make it suitable for children and pre-teens. Craven declined. Another early suitor was Paramount Pictures; however the studios passed on the project due to A Nightmare on Elm Streets similarity to Dreamscape (1984), a film they were producing at the time. Universal Studios also passed; Craven, who was in desperate personal and financial straits during this period, later framed their rejection letter {{on the wall of}} his office.|$|E

25|$|I {{want to say}} at {{once that}} I frankly believe that Irving Berlin is the {{greatest}} songwriter that has ever lived.... His songs are exquisite cameos of perfection, and <b>each</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> is as beautiful as its neighbor. Irving Berlin remains, I think, America's Schubert. But apart from his genuine talent for song-writing, Irving Berlin has had a greater influence upon American music than any other one man. It was Irving Berlin who was the very first to have created a real, inherent American music.... Irving Berlin {{was the first to}} free the American song from the nauseating sentimentality which had previously characterized it, and by introducing and perfecting ragtime he had actually given us the first germ of an American musical idiom; he had sown the first seeds of an American music.|$|E
500|$|A {{major problem}} for the Swiss {{was the lack of}} any unified command. [...] The cantonal contingents only took orders from their own leaders. [...] Complaints of insubordination were common. [...] The Swiss Diet had to adopt this {{resolution}} on 11 March 1499: [...] "Every canton shall impress upon its soldiers that when the Confederates are under arms together, <b>each</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> whatever his canton, shall obey the officers of the others." ...|$|E

For instance, the “Northern Tour” Jon and Sansa embark on would probably take a couple weeks, but Arya’s storyline over the past few episodes only spans a few days. We realized a while ago that if we tied ourselves in knots trying to make all the “story days” line up between all the characters the momentum would suffer." ...|$|E

500|$|Hornung's prose {{is widely}} admired for its lucid-yet-simple style. Oliver Edwards, writing in The Times, {{considered}} that [...] "not the least attractive {{part of the}} Raffles books is the simple, plain, unaffected language in which <b>each</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> is written". The obituarist in the same newspaper agrees, and thinks Hornung had [...] "a power of good and clear description and a talent for mystery and surprise". Colin Watson also considers the point, and observes that in Hornung's writing, [...] "superfluous description has been avoided and account of action is to the point", while Doyle admired his [...] "sudden use of the right adjective and the right phrase", something the writer and journalist Jeremy Lewis sees as a [...] "flamboyant, Kiplingesque taste for the vivid".|$|E

She decided to rely on her father's advice to retain his councillors and defer to her husband, whom she considered to be more experienced, on other matters. Both decisions, though natural, later gave cause for regret. Ten years later, Maria Theresa recalled in her Political Testament the circumstances under which she had ascended: [...] "I found myself without money, without credit, without army, without experience and knowledge of my own and finally, also without any counsel because <b>each</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> at first wanted to wait and see how things would develop." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music was}} {{described}} as maximalist by Jon Caramanica of The New York Times, who also took note of East Coast hip hop elements, and Ryan Dombal from Pitchfork, who deemed it a [...] "culmination" [...] of West's past work: [...] "Musically, [...] largely continues where 2007's Graduation left off in its maximalist hip-hop bent, with flashes of The College Dropouts comfort-food sampling and Late Registrations baroque instrumentation weaved in seamlessly". AllMusic's Andy Kellman views it as the [...] "culmination" [...] of those albums, while noting that [...] "it does not merely draw characteristics from <b>each</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> The 13 tracks ... sometimes fuse them together simultaneously. Consequently, the sonic and emotional layers are often difficult to pry apart and enumerate". Kellman denotes [...] "All of the Lights" [...] as most representative of the album's [...] "contrasting elements and maniacal extravagance". By contrast, Robert Christgau from MSN Music comments that the music eschews the [...] "grace" [...] of The College Dropout and Late Registration for [...] "grandiosity" [...] and [...] "the sonic luxuries of this [...] return to form".|$|E

[...] Tancharoen called it [...] "the promise of something fairly ominous to come", and stated, [...] "We will be uncovering things from the midseason opener {{all the way to}} the finale. We will slowly be discovering what that image is." [...] She added that any [...] "clues" [...] would likely play out during present day sequences rather than further flash-forwards, such as when Johnson receives a vision of the flash-forward in [...] "Spacetime", an episode where she learns that [...] "she cannot change the outcome of these visions and the future is the future." [...] Whedon discussed this idea, and that of the [...] "theory behind the Inhumans that <b>each</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> serves a purpose", saying, Inhumans [...] "are made, they're not random. There's a lack of something that needs filling and an Inhuman will be created that fills that niche. It's an interesting concept we like playing with, and that plays into the idea of fate, which with our future visions, we're hitting pretty hard." [...] On choosing Lincoln to be the one to die, which the executive producers knew going into the season when forming the arcs for Lincoln, Daisy, and Ward, Bell said he [...] "earned it" [...] adding that Lincoln comes to a point where he realizes what his purpose is, with Whedon noting that he understands that Daisy has a different purpose. Whedon continued that the decision was based on the fact that the series did not [...] "want to be a body count show, but it is a real world with real stakes. What we had not done is the heroic death and the full-sacrifice death. This was a conscious decision. We also think that there’s a poetry in the fact that the person doing it doesn’t consider himself a hero. That’s the beauty of the moment—it’s not just for , but it is, and it’s not just for him, but it is." ...|$|E
500|$|In an NPR {{interview}} via affiliate WBUR-FM, Mumbai Mirror columnist Aseem Chhabra called Chak De! India [...] "an {{example of}} a film that's been made {{within the framework of}} Bollywood and yet it is a very different film. It does take up some realistic issues, and what I really liked about the film was that the women who acted, you know, who are part of the team, <b>each</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> got a chance. Their personality, their characters, were very well-written, and so, the superstar in the film was Shahrukh Khan, who was the coach of the team; he doesn't sort of take over the whole film. Every supporting character gets a role, and it's a very inspiring movie that really changed the mood in India. People loved it". Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave the film four out of five stars stating that it was a film of [...] "great performances by a bunch of unknowns." [...] India Today called Chak De! India [...] "the most feisty girl power movie to have come out of Bollywood ever." [...] Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu wrote, [...] "At another level, Chak De is about women's liberation. It {{is one of the best}} feminist films of our times." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "Chak De's ... a winner all the way." [...] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express called the film [...] "the most authentic, meticulously researched sports movie India has made". [...] In Kolkata's Telegraph, Bharathi S. Pradhan wrote that the film combines [...] "an extremely well-knit screenplay with unrelentingly deft direction, 16 unknown, and not even glamorous, girls simply carried you with them, with one single known actor compelling you to watch Chak De India without blinking". Jaspreet Pandohar of the BBC gave Chak De! India four out of five stars stating that [...] "while the tale of the sporting underdog is hardly new, Jaideep Sahni's screenplay offers a rare look at a popular Indian sport often overshadowed by cricket." [...] Andy Webster of The New York Times wrote that the film gave a fresh look to the conventional underdog sports film, comparing its premise to the U.S. victory in the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup. Derek Elley of Variety called Chak De! India [...] "a patriotic heartwarmer that scores some old-fashioned entertainment goals." [...] In The Hollywood Reporter, Kirk Honeycutt wrote that the [...] "technical credits are first rate with excellent cinematography, quicksilver editing, musical montages of practice and a fine use of locations." ...|$|E
