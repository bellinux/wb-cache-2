50|$|The {{principle}} of operation of Bio-FET devices based on detecting changes in electrostatic potential due to binding of analyte. This the same mechanism of operation as glass electrode sensors which also detect changes in surface potential but were developed {{as early as}} the 1920's. Due to the small magnitude of the changes in surface potential upon binding of biomolecules or changing pH, glass electrodes require a <b>high</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>amplifier</b> which increases the size and cost of the device. In contrast, the advantage of Bio-FET devices is that they operate as an intrinsic amplifier, converting small changes in surface potential to large changes in current (through the transistor component) without the need for additional circuitry. This means BioFETs have the capability to be much smaller and more affordable than glass electrode-based biosensors. If the transistor is operated in the subthreshold region, then an exponential increase in current is expected for a unit change in surface potential.|$|E

Furthermore, as SET amplifiers have a relatively <b>high</b> output <b>impedance,</b> it is hard to couple them effectively to a loudspeaker which hasn't been designed especially to be driven by a <b>high</b> output <b>impedance</b> <b>amplifier,</b> as this will cause the amplifier to be much more sensitive to the loudspeaker's impedance characteristics across the spectrum, resulting in coloration.|$|R

Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} thesis. In this thesis a {{design of a}} CMOS transimpedance amplifier (TIA) for a capacitive micro-machined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) is presented. CMUT’s have a high electrical impedance when used as receivers. Any capacitance between the CMUT and a <b>high</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>amplifier</b> will degrade the frequency response. So, we need to amplify the current rather than the voltage. This approach requires a transimpedance amplifier. The designed TIA has a 30 MHz bandwidth and 400 kΩ transimpedance gain. The total input referred current noise of the TIA is 270 fA/√Hz at 10 MHz. The noise figure of the TIA is 2. 7 dB at 10 MHz when connected to the CMUT with 200 kΩ source resistance.

40|$|In {{vehicles}} such as e. g. cabriolets, {{some parts}} of the skin are made of plastics e. g. the trunk lid. This makes the integration of antennas into these relatively narrow integration volumes possible. Since the radiation characteristics of a single antenna are restricted by a variety of boundary conditions in such a narrow environment, the overall directional characteristics of the antenna part can be optimised by using several of such very compact antenna elements and applying an antenna diversity system. It can be shown that the reception of such an integrated antenna diversity system leads to an excellent quality of reception, which is much higher than the one of a single mast antenna on the vehicle. Such compact diversity antennas in this narrow environment are possible due to an advanced concept of <b>high</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>amplifiers</b> which leads to a satisfying effective antenna height even for relatively narrow antenna structures. In this concept a good reception quality is achieved with selectable frequency dependence, which is nearly independent of the frequency dependence of the effective length and impedance of the antenna structure while a high noisesensitivity and a high linearity are ensured at the same time. A powerful automatic gain control of the active antenna is implemented as well, in order to prevent nonlinear effects.

40|$|Summary. The {{purpose of}} the {{investigation}} {{was to determine the}} applicability of extending inverse feedback techniques to electrodynamic loudspeakers by finding first, what the general limitations were, and second, how much improvement in speaker characteristics could be secured. A simple lumped-constant representation of low-frequency speaker behavior was used for analysis of various types of electrical damping. Constants were determined for a typical speaker and mounting, and also for a suitable output transformer. The resulting combined equivalent circuit could be used to calculate the characteristics of the low-frequency cutoff, but was of little help for the upper cutoff. No simple, adequate representation of high-frequency speaker behavior could be found. An attempt was made to measure the frequency characteristics of the voice coil motional voltage by bridge measurements, but this was abandoned because of difficulties inherent in the method and lack of proper sized bridge elements. Three methods applicable to practical feedback systems were next used to obtain a speaker motional voltage. It was impossible to get usable high frequency data with two of the types, at least with the versions used, and the third gave misleading results. It appeared that the more obvious ways of obtaining a motional voltage were not as simple to use as one might expect from references in the literature. More accurate data obtained with a frequency modulation type of displacement pickup (whose output is much less convenient to use in a practical feedback system than the output of a velocity pick-up) put the upper limit to the use of feedback from 4 to 9 kc in a few typical cases, on a velocity to voice coil voltage basis, and with the latter held constant. Use of a <b>high</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>amplifier</b> would probably extend this limit at least one octave, but limitations in the measuring systems prevented finding the actual limit in this case. Transient response tests were made, and the results indicated qualitatively that electrical damping has noticeably less effect on speaker performance at the middle and high audio frequencies-than at the lower ones. This means that the beneficial effects of feedback would be less at the higher frequencies than at the low. Velocity-type feedback is potentially a useful means of controlling speaker damping and providing some distortion reduction in the speaker itself, at least in the range of piston action. Velocity-type feedback is a considerably more effective means of speaker damping than. the usual method of impedance reduction by feedback from the output of the amplifier. Further work is necessary to find the exact upper limit to the use of feedback with typical speakers, and to develop a velocity pickup which can cover all the usable feedback range. Frequency response and distortion tests on an actual speaker feedback system are needed to evaluate definitely the worth of such systems...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Recent {{studies in}} epilepsy, cognition, and brain machine {{interfaces}} {{have shown the}} utility of recording intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) with greater spatial resolution. Many of these studies utilize microelectrodes connected to specialized amplifiers that are optimized for such recordings. We recently measured the impedances of several commercial microelectrodes and demonstrated that they will distort iEEG signals if connected to clinical EEG amplifiers commonly used in most centers. In this study we demonstrate the clinical implications of this effect and identify some of the potential difficulties in using microelectrodes. Methods: Human iEEG data were digitally filtered to simulate the signal recorded by a hybrid grid (two macroelectrodes and eight microelectrodes) connected to a standard EEG amplifier. The filtered iEEG data were read by three trained epileptologists, and high frequency oscillations (HFOs) were detected with a well-known algorithm. The filtering method was verified experimentally by recording an injected EEG signal in a saline bath with the same physical acquisition system used to generate the model. Several electrodes underwent scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Key Findings: Macroelectrode recordings were unaltered compared to the source iEEG signal, but microelectrodes attenuated low frequencies. The attenuated signals were difficult to interpret: all three clinicians changed their clinical scoring of slowing and seizures when presented with the same data recorded on different sized electrodes. The HFO detection algorithm was oversensitive with microelectrodes, classifying many more HFOs than when the same data were recorded with macroelectrodes. In addition, during experimental recordings the microelectrodes produced much greater noise as well as large baseline fluctuations, creating sharply contoured transients, and superimposed “false” HFOs. SEM of these microelectrodes demonstrated marked variability in exposed electrode surface area, lead fractures, and sharp edges. Significance: Microelectrodes {{should not be used}} with low impedance (< 1 GΩ) amplifiers due to severe signal attenuation and variability that changes clinical interpretations. The current method of preparing microelectrodes can leave sharp edges and nonuniform amounts of exposed wire. Even when recorded with <b>higher</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> microelectrode data are highly prone to artifacts that are difficult to interpret. Great care must be taken when analyzing iEEG from <b>high</b> <b>impedance</b> microelectrodes...|$|R

Eight channels of vector modulation and isolating power amplifiers were constructed so that the performance of different amplifier architectures could be investigated. An eight channel system was implemented and tested using both quantitative bench measurements and imaging experiments.

The modulation system implemented is based on vector modulators {{in order to simplify}} integration with existing MRI systems. Current Source and Low Output <b>Impedance</b> <b>amplifiers</b> were built and compared in terms of theory of operation, their ability to isolate array coils, and the amount of power they can deliver to a coil. The current source amplifiers function by introducing a <b>high</b> <b>impedance</b> in series with the coil which is series resonant. In contrast, the low output <b>impedance</b> <b>amplifiers</b> present a low impedance to the coil which has a matching network that forms a parallel resonant tank. Both are able to provide isolation, with the current source amplifiers producing in excess of 30 dB of isolation and low output <b>impedance</b> <b>amplifiers</b> providing approximately 12. 5 dB in practical situations. The current source amplifiers can only produce approximately 10 A (or between 150 W and 300 W) of output power because they are not power matched.

Ultimately, there is no single best architecture of power amplifiers at this time. Standard amplifiers are useful when only one or two transmit channels are needed and broad-bandedness is valuable.

40|$|In modern medicine, the {{measurement}} of electrophysiological signals {{play a key role}} in health monitoring and diagnostics. Electrical activity originating from our nerve and muscle cells conveys real-time information about our current health state. The two most common and actively used techniques for measuring such signals are electrocardiography (ECG) and electroencephalography (EEG). These signals are very weak, reaching from a few millivolts down to tens of microvolts in amplitude, and have the majority of the power located at very low frequencies, from below 1 Hz up to 40 Hz. These characteristics sets very tough requirements on the electrical circuit designs used to measure them. Usually, measurement is performed by attaching electrodes with direct contact to the skin using an adhesive, conductive gel to fixate them. This method requires a clinical environment and is time consuming, tedious and may cause the patient discomfort. This thesis investigates another method for such measurements; by using a non-contact, capacitively coupled sensor, many of these shortcomings can be overcome. While this method relieves some problems, it also introduces several design difficulties such as: circuit noise, extremely <b>high</b> input <b>impedance</b> and interference. A capacitively coupled sensor was created using the bottom layer of a printed circuit board (PCB) as a capacitor plate and placing it against the signal source, that acts as the opposite capacitor plate. The PCB solder mask layer and any air in between the two acts as the insulator to create a full capacitor. The signal picked up by this sensor was then amplified by 60 dB with a <b>high</b> input <b>impedance</b> <b>amplifier</b> circuit and further conditioned through filtering. Two measurements were made of the same circuit, but with different input impedances; one with 10 MΩ and one with 10 GΩ input impedance. Additional filtering was designed to combat interference from the main power lines at 50 Hz and 150 Hz that was discovered during initial measurements. The circuits were characterized with their transfer functions, and the ability to amplify a very low-level, low frequency input signal. The results of these measurements show that <b>high</b> input <b>impedance</b> is of critical importance for the functionality of the sensor and that an input impedance of 10 GΩ is sufficient to produce a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 9. 7 dB after digital filtering with an input signal of 25 μV at 10 Hz...|$|R
