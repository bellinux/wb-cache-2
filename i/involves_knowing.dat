2500|$|John Calvin {{viewed the}} {{understanding}} of Christ's mission as {{an essential element of}} knowing him: knowing Christ involves an understanding of why he was sent. In Calvin's view humans are not capable of understanding God in his own right, and can only begin to know God through Christ. In Institutes of the Christian Religion (II.xv) Calvin was critical of those who know Christ [...] "in name only", e.g. those who simply teach that Christ is the Redeemer without understanding or teaching how he redeems. For Calvin knowing Christ <b>involves</b> <b>knowing</b> his power and dignity in terms of the threefold office: as priest, prophet and king.|$|E

Executive management processes involve planning, monitoring, evaluating and revising one's own thinking processes and products.

40|$|How {{might we}} think differently? This book {{is an attempt}} to respond to this question. Its {{contributors}} are all interested in non-standard modes of knowing. They are all more or less uneasy with the restrictions or the agendas implied by academic modes of knowing, and they have chosen to do this by working with, through, or against one important Western alternative – that of the baroque. Why the baroque? One answer is that the baroque made space for and fostered many forms of otherness. It <b>involved</b> <b>knowing</b> things differently, extravagantly, excessively, and in materially heterogeneous ways, and it apprehended that which is other and could not be caught in a cognitive or symbolic net. It also <b>involved</b> <b>knowing</b> in ways that did not gather into a single point, and knew itself to be performative. A part of a great Western division between rationalist and non-rationalist modes of knowing, the baroque is therefore a possible resource for creating ways of knowing differently, a storehouse of possible alternative techniques. To say {{this is not to say}} that it is the right mode of knowing. The book’s authors do not seek to create a ‘baroque social science’ whatever that might be, but instead work in a range of ways to explore how drawing on the ‘resources of the baroque’ can help us to think differently...|$|R

50|$|Recognition is {{a purely}} {{involuntary}} urge {{that has no}} regard for pre-existing relationships. This can cause considerable tension between {{one or both of}} those experiencing it and their established partners; while Recognition does not dictate the formation of a lasting relationship, it is very common.

Generally, even if a longer relationship does not develop, a new-found level of respect is formed. Some elves have tried to resist Recognition, but this only causes them to experience increasing physical and mental distress. However, Richard Pini has stated that unconsummated Recognition is never fatal.|$|R

50|$|One {{of the key}} {{concerns}} of older adults is the experience of memory loss, especially as {{it is one of}} the hallmark symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. However, memory loss is qualitatively different in normal aging from the kind of memory loss associated with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's (Budson & Price, 2005). Research has revealed that individuals' performance on memory tasks that rely on frontal regions declines with age. Older adults tend to exhibit deficits on tasks that <b>involve</b> <b>knowing</b> the temporal order in which they learned information; source memory tasks that require them to remember the specific circumstances or context in which they learned information; and prospective memory tasks that involve remembering to perform an act at a future time.
