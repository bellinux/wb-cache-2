40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} an analysis of the potential impact of seven possible scenarios on the landing and financial proceeds of Dutch ships commercially fishing seabass for each particular type of fishing. This analysis was conducted following a request from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and based on data and models of Wageningen Economic Research and Wageningen Marine Research. The analysis has shown that in the Netherlands, handline fisheries are economically most dependant on seabass. The other <b>gear</b> <b>categories,</b> with the exception of set net vessels, are economically less dependent on seabass, yet collectively land a similar amount of seabass as handline fisheries...|$|E
40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} patterns in catch rates and in allocation of fishing effort were analysed for the coastal fishery in Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia, {{to assess whether}} fishermen can optimise their strategy from catch information, or whether they fish under great uncertainty and merely minimise risks. On average 517 fishing units operated in the 2800 km 2 area, catching 21 t fish day- 1. Major <b>gear</b> <b>categories</b> were hook and line (59 ␘f total effort and 5 ␘f total catch), and lift nets (16 ␘f total effort and 70 ␘f total catch). The size of individual resource spaces varied with gear type and was smaller in unfavourable weather conditions. Although spatial patterns in catch rates at {{the scale of the}} whole archipelago were evident, fishermen could not differentiate between locations, as catch variance within their individual resource spaces was high relative to the contrasts in spatial patterns. The aggregated distribution of fishing effort in Spermonde must be explained by factors such as the small scale of operations, rather than fish abundance...|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} we examine how consumers ’ brand preferences and price sensitivities evolve as {{their levels of}} experience increase in outdoor sports <b>gear</b> <b>categories.</b> Using a Hidden Markov modeling framework, we investigate how consumers evolve along discrete latent states that represent their experience and knowledge levels, and how this corresponds to changes in preference parameters. In our empirical estimation and evaluation of the model we utilize customer membership data from a large outdoor and sporting goods retailer. Existing single-category Hidden Markov approaches require a rich purchase history and do not work well for the types of durable product categories in an area such as sport climbing, as typical customers make relatively few purchases in any single category, even {{over long periods of}} time. For this reason we use a multi-category framework in which unobservable experience levels are inferred by leveraging information from multiple categories. Using a Hierarchical Bayes estimation, we account for initial consumer heterogeneity as customers first take up the sport at different skill levels. This also allows us to account for consumer heterogeneity in transition probabilities as customers accumulate experience and knowledge at different rates. W...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the catch efficiency of fishing gears, catch per unit effort (CPUE) {{data were collected}} for two years during January 2007 to December 2008 from the river Halda. Analyses were done to examine the variation of CPUE among gears, studied sections, months and years. The mean CPUE for pooled data of all gears was 2. 247 ± 0. 265 kg. gear- 1 day- 1 and 2. 697 ± 0. 355 kg. gear- 1 day- 1 for 2007 and 2008 respectively. Among eight <b>gear</b> <b>categories,</b> bag nets yielded the highest CPUE during 2007 (5. 957 ± 0. 704 kg. gear- 1 day- 1) and seine nets during 2008 (7. 288 ± 1. 477 kg. gear- 1 day- 1). Among 31 gear types, small meshed bag nets yielded the highest CPUE (18. 065 ± 6. 660 and 15. 69 ± 4. 479 kg. gear- 1 day- 1 during 2007 and 2008 respectively). CPUE was highest during March-April and September-November periods. Analysis of variance showed significant difference among catch rates of different fishing gears. The CPUE differed significantly among different months for net fence, gill net, cast net and scoop net during 2007; and for seine net, net fence, bag net and cast net during 2008...|$|E
40|$|The Working Group on Spatial Fisheries Data (WGSFD) met at ICES Headquarters, Copenhagen, 10 – 13 June 2014. ICES {{had issued}} two data calls for {{aggregated}} VMS {{data for the}} years 2009 – 2012 : one covering the OSPAR region and one covering the HELCOM region. The group evaluated the data, and used them to answer the ToRs. ICES have produced a document describing ICES Conditions for VMS data use, which {{all members of the}} group signed. The VMS data that ICES received is only to be used for ICES work and after answering the ToRs, the data are to be deleted. The submitted VMS data were aggregated to DCF métier level 6, giving more than 900 unique codes; however some countries only submitted data aggregated to level 4 gear codes. To overcome this discrepancy, it was decided to group the métiers into broader <b>gear</b> <b>categories.</b> For the OSPAR region: Bottom trawls, Dredges, Demersal seines and Beam trawls. For the HELCOM region: Gillnets, Longlines, Bottom trawls and Midwater trawls. As part of the evaluation of the data quality, the aggregated VMS effort data submitted was compared to effort data from the STECF database. These two independent datasets showed similar overall patterns, indicating that the submitted VMS dataset could be used to show the distribution of fishing effort. WGSFD produced a cleaned VMS dataset, aggregated by year and gear groupings, which other ICES EG’s can use. Caveats applying to all the VMS data products and maps in the report were listed. Based on the evaluation of the submitted data, a revised exchange format for aggregated VMS data was suggested. To answer ToR a, DCF indicators 5, 6 and 7 were computed byyear, ICES area (sub-division in the Baltic) and both by gear group and total for all gears. DCF indicator 5 relates to the total area covered by fishing activity, DCF indicator 6 has been calculated as the extent to which fishing activities are aggregated, and DCF indicator 7, the total area not impacted by fishing activities, was calculated by subtracting DCF indicator 5 fishing area from the area of the ICES area/subdivision. All the DCF indicators have been expressed both as area and proportions of the total area. In ToR a, WGSFD was also requested to contribute to ICES work on MSFD descriptor 6. The group produced a cleaned dataset, aggregated by year and gear group, which other ICES EG’s can use to relate fishing pressure to potential impact on underlying habitats. The following example outputs were produced: 1. Map of mean fishing effort in number of hours per km 2. 2. Map of increase/decrease in fishing effort over the years analysed. 3. Map of number of years a c-square has been impacted, with different thresholds. For ToR b, WGSFD responded to requests from other ICES EG’s: Requests from WGBFAS and WGNSSK related to fishing effort, a request from WGMPCZM and a request from ADGVME regarding use of AIS data. For ToR c on reviewing ongoing work for analysing VMS data, WGSFD were updated on: • the ongoing work in the BENTHIS project; • a method developed by JNCC for estimating benthic abrasion caused by human activities; • a nested grids method for calculating the area of the seabed impacted by fishing gear; • the bias and variance of estimates of fishing effort from VMS data; • production of an Atlas of Commercial Fisheries around Ireland. ToR d was a request from OSPAR to propose and apply a method to map mobile bottom contact fishing intensity and to prepare a first OSPAR-wide map of the spatial and temporal intensity of mobile bottom-contact fishing activities. The co-lead of the ICG-COBAM benthic expert group was present at the meeting to provide information both on the purpose of the data call and how the products were to be analysed. The group performed an initial evaluation of whether the data submitted served the purpose of the OSPAR request, and based on this work, WGSFD proposed a revised exchange format for future data calls for aggregated VMS data. Maps for the OSPAR region showing VMS effort by year and gear group were produced as well as a map showing the gear composition in the area and an example map applying the abrasion methodology giving maps of surface and sub-surface bottom contact...|$|E

40|$|Maximum <b>gears</b> {{for youth}} <b>{{category}}</b> riders are limited. As a result, youth category riders are regularly compelled {{to ride in}} a high cadence regime. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate if regular work at high cadence regime due to limited transmission in youth category riders reflects in effectual cadence at the point of maximal power generation during the 10 second sprint effort. 24 junior and youth national team cyclist’s average maximal peak power at various cadence regimes was registered on Cyclus- 2 ergometer using cyclists own bikes. Effectual cadence at the point of maximal power generation (group average 113. 9 ± 10. 6 rpm) is similar to the values of professional road cyclist during the last 200 m sprinting to finish where 10 second average cadence is 109. 9 ± 5. 3 rpm and highest average cadence is 117. 6 ± 6. 1 rpm. The premise that regular work at high cadence regime due to limited transmission in youth category riders reflects in effectual cadence at the point of maximal power generation during the 10 second sprint effort was not corroborated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: During {{the last}} decade an {{unprecedented}} amount of excavations of Roman period rural settlements {{took place in the}} presumed civitas of the Cananefates, which covers a great part of the modern day Dutch province of Zuid-Holland. A number of these excavations yielded substantial more metal finds than is common for the region, including an unsuspected amount of Roman military equipment and horse <b>gear,</b> a find <b>category</b> that until recently was almost nonexistent in the region. In the neighboring Dutch Eastern River Area, the heartland of the Batavians, Roman military equipment and horse gear from civilian context has always been a prominent find category and {{has been the subject of}} extensive research (Nicolay 2007). In order to test some of the ideas from that research, a survey was conducted of all military equipment from the Cananefatian from non military context and held against the existing theories. The comparison yielded some interesting similarities and differences between both regions and provided enough questions to challenge some of the existing theories. Throughout the Roman period differences in horse gear remain very high. However, against expectations for the later periods the Cananefatian region features relatively more military equipment than the Batavian region. This sheds additional light on the questions about the role of the veteran, the pacification of the Rhine frontier and the theory about rearming of the population during the unrest of the 3 rd century...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need {{to take into account}} a “mixed fisheries” approach in management, assessment and sampling of fish stocks. To do this effectively it is necessary for groups of fishing trips with homogeneous fishing patterns or tactics to be defined into métiers. Presented here is the result of an Irish case study analysis in applying multivariate statistics to declared logbook landings to define Irish fleet métiers operating in the Irish Sea. Established multivariate statistical procedures, a combination of factorial and cluster analysis, were applied to five variables; landing profile, vessel length <b>category,</b> <b>gear,</b> mesh size range and month. The investigation has shown this methodology to be a suitable tool in identifying métiers without prior assumptions and enabled data to be described from a multivariate statistical perspective providing useful and informative results. In total twenty-two métiers were identified and defined from 2003 landings data, and a further 5 groups were formed to include trips which could not be assigned to a métier. Definitions were applied to 2003 - 2005 landings and effort data to examine their dynamics and stability. The dominant métier (in terms of effort and trips) contained high proportions of landed Nephrops taken by bottom otter trawlers using 70 - 89 mm meshes. The effort in this métier was fairly stable over time. The greatest increases in effort and trip allocation occurred within métiers employing pots and traps for crustacean species. A small number of minor métiers (in terms of landings and effort) became obsolete over the three years examined. The effects of recent management measures are likely to have contributed to declines in the numbers of trips and effort in some métiers. For example, days-at-sea, limited mobile gears such as bottom otter trawls and beam trawls with ≥ 100 mm mesh, have declined. Such changes within métiers over recent years have contributed to a deeper understanding of fleet dynamics in the Irish Sea. This analysis has identified and highlighted a segment of polyvalent Irish fishing vessels, which move between several métiers within a year. The definition of métiers can be used to enhance the Irish sampling programme in the Irish Sea by developing a finer scale, métier based, stratification of sampling. This in turn enables increased precision and robustness of national assessment data thus improving assessments and management advice. Defining métiers will prove advantageous in developing mixed fisheries assessments and advice. Funder: Marine Institut...|$|R
