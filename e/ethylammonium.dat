40|$|The {{kinetics}} and {{mechanism of}} ethylamine synthesis from ammonia and ethanol over several large pore acid catalysts are described. Mordenite produced higher monoethylamine yields than the zeolites beta, Y, mazzite, and amorphous silica–alumina.

40|$|The {{properties}} of the hydrogen bonds in <b>ethylammonium</b> nitrate are analyzed by using molecular dynamics simulations and infrared as well as nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. <b>Ethylammonium</b> nitrate features a flexible three-dimensional network of hydrogen bonds with moderate strengths, which makes it distinct from related triethylammonium-based ionic liquids. First, the network's flexibility is manifested in a not very pronounced correlation of the hydrogen bond geometries, which is caused by rapid interchanges of bonding partners. The large flexibility of the network leads to a substantial broadening of the mid-IR absorption band, with the contributions due to N-H stretching motions ranging from 2800 to 3250.

40|$|The {{number of}} studies on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites has soared in recent years.

Here we show {{for the first time that}} <b>ethylammonium</b> can in fact be incorporated coordinately with methylammonium in the lattice of a 3 D perovskite thanks to a balance of opposite lattice distortion strains.

40|$|The {{temperature}} dependence of <b>ethylammonium</b> chloride structure {{has been investigated}} by in situ laboratory parallel-beam X-ray powder diffraction. A polymorphic transition from a monoclinic LT phase to a tetragonal HT phase has been observed at 358 K. Such transformation has a reconstructive character. The thermal expansion of both polymorphs is small and anisotropic {{as a consequence of}} their organization through an anisotropic interaction network. The high temperature (HT) phase (possible space group P 4 /n or P 4 /nmm, a = 5. 05 angstrom, c = 9. 99 angstrom) has an excess volume of similar to 11 % as compared with the low temperature (LT) one. The HT polyrnorph's structure has been solved by direct methods using powder diffraction data. In the absence of clear indications, it has been refined in P 4 /nmm. The structural properties of an <b>ethylammonium</b> chloride/water mixture at ambient conditions were also studied by using an integrated approach, which combines X-ray diffraction measurements and molecular dynamics simulations carried out with both the SPC/E and TIP 5 P water models. By refining a single interaction potential, very good agreement between the theoretical and experimental diffraction patterns was obtained, {{especially in the case of}} the TIP 5 P simulation. A complex structural behavior in which cations and anions do not possess a completely closed hydration shell of their own has been highlighted. Conversely, "solvent-shared ion pairs" are formed, in which one or more water molecules act as a bridge between the chloride and <b>ethylammonium</b> ions.

At least seven layers are observed for EAN at 14 °C (melting point 13 °C), decreasing as the temperature is increased to 30 °C due to thermal energy disrupting solvophobic forces that lead to segregation of cation alkyl tails from the charged ammonium and nitrate moieties. The number and properties of the solvation layers can also be controlled by introducing an alcohol moiety to the cation’s alkyl tail (EtAN), or by replacing the nitrate anion with formate (EAF and PAF), even leading to the detection of distinct cation and anion sublayers. Substitution of primary by secondary or tertiary ammonium cations reduces the number of solvation layers formed, and also weakens the cation layer adsorbed onto mica.

40|$|The phase {{behavior}} and self-assembled microstructures {{of a range}} of oligo(oxyethylene) -n-alkyl ether (CiEj) surfactants has been investigated in propylammonium nitrate (PAN), a room temperature ionic liquid. Micelles and single-phase microemulsions were all found to form at alkyl chain lengths from dodecyl to octadecyl, and lyotropic liquid crystals formed with hexadecyl chains or longer. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) shows that self-assembly occurs by solvophobic interactions driving the aggregation of the alkyl chains, but several results indicate that these are weaker in PAN than in water or <b>ethylammonium</b> nitrate, due chiefly to the hydrophobicity of PAN. Longer alkyl chains are needed for lyotropic liquid crystals to form, and higher surfactant concentrations are needed to form a single phase microemulsion. Conductivity shows these microemulsions to be weakly structured, and relatively insensitive to oil or surfactant molecular structure, unlike water-based systems. However, SANS contrast variation reveals a nanosegregation of oil from the alkyl tails of surfactants within the microemulsion, and may suggest a cosurfactant-like role for the propylammonium cation. Molecular areas within microemulsions and lamellar phases are larger than corresponding water- or <b>ethylammonium</b> nitrate-based systems due to the large molecular volume of the solvating PANs...|$|E
