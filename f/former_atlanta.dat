25|$|In September 2011, it was {{announced}} that Joe Solmonese would step down as president of HRC following the end of his contract in 2012.

25|$|Harris Teeter's {{expansion}} into Atlanta included 15 stores {{around the city}} and its suburbs. There were plans to further expand in Atlanta. However, these plans were only partially fulfilled and poorly executed, leading the chain {{to pull out of the}} Atlanta market altogether in 2001. Atlanta already had an established supermarket base with Publix and Kroger. Kroger quickly bought and reopened some of the <b>former</b> <b>Atlanta</b> Harris Teeter store spaces as Kroger stores, although remodeling these stores to Kroger's store floor plan and design took a few years.|$|E

25|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the 2014 season, Tampa Bay hired Ben Steele to become the team's new offensive quality control coach as well as <b>former</b> <b>Atlanta</b> Falcons offensive coordinator, Dirk Koetter, to be their new offensive coordinator after parting ways with QB coach and interim offensive coordinator Marcus Arroyo. Having a 2–14 record, tied for the worst record in the NFL in 2014, Tampa gained the 1st overall pick in the 2015 NFL draft. They also made some headlines when they released QB Josh McCown on February 11, 2015 to save $5.25 million in cap space. With the first overall pick in the NFL draft, the Buccaneers selected Jameis Winston from Florida State. Throughout the offseason, there was much debate whether the Buccaneers should pick Jameis, or Oregon QB Marcus Mariota.|$|E
25|$|In July 2003, <b>former</b> <b>Atlanta</b> mayor Shirley Franklin {{announced}} a new terminal to be named for Maynard H. Jackson, Jr.. The new international terminal would be built {{on the east side}} of the airport near International Concourse E, on a site that had been occupied by air cargo facilities and the midfield control tower. It has added twelve new gates able to hold wide-body jets, which can be converted to sixteen narrow-body gates, as well as check-in desks and a baggage claim area solely for international carriers. Additionally, the international terminal has its own parking lot just for international passengers with over 1,100 spaces. Arriving international passengers whose final destination is Atlanta can keep their luggage as they proceed to exit the airport. The new terminal is connected to Concourse E by the tram and also has ground transportation access via I-75.|$|E
25|$|After {{their worst}} season ranking in decades, Jokerit {{acquired}} {{the services of}} HIFK head coach and former NHL'er Doug Shedden. Shedden brought in a key player from HIFK, Kim Hirschovits, who had gained responsibility under Shedden in his former team. The refreshed team also featured Jyrki Louhi from the 2005–06 champions HPK and Juuso Riksman from Ässät, the second placed team of 2006. Jokerit acquired some scoring talent {{in the form of}} Tim Stapleton and some NHL-experience as Shedden's former protege from Toronto-era Clarke Wilm moved to Jokerit mid-season. Shedden's first Jokerit season was good as the team returned to the play-offs and infamously defeated the reigning champions HPK in the semi-finals to advance to the finals against Kärpät. Although Jokerit lost to Kärpät in the finals, the 2006–07 season was a good start for Shedden in Jokerit. During the 2007–08 season Jokerit celebrated their 40th anniversary and on 27 October Jokerit retired the jersey of former alumni Jari Kurri. Jokerit strengthened their goaltending department by acquiring former NHL and Finnish national team Goaltender Jussi Markkanen to replace Scott Langkow before the season and added more NHL experience by contracting <b>former</b> <b>Atlanta</b> Thrashers and Vancouver Canucks center Tommi Santala after the season had started. During the 2007–2008 SM-Liiga season, Doug Shedden announced that he had been contracted to the Swiss team EV Zug and was leaving Jokerit after the season. After a while, it was announced that Shedden's job as the head coach of the team would be taken over by ex-NHL head coach Glen Hanlon after Shedden's contract was to expire. Shedden's last season as the head coach of Jokerit ended worse than expected. Although Jokerit were predicted to be championship contenders, they lost a 3–1 lead in the series against Espoo Blues and lost the series 3 to 4. Jokerit was dropped to the bronze medal game where they lost to Tappara, thus finishing fourth in SM-liiga for the 2007–08 season. Along with Shedden, Jokerit also lost the services of assistant coach Waltteri Immonen as he followed Shedden to EV Zug.|$|E

500|$|After its release, the Winnipeg Jets of the National Hockey League played [...] "Jump" [...] on {{the arena}} PA system {{as the team}} came onto the ice. They used the song until the team's {{departure}} for Phoenix after the 1995–96 season. On the team's return in 2011, public outcry {{for use of the}} song initially was ignored, as the team's management company True North Sports and Entertainment wished to create a break with the past, considering the previous Jets a different organization from the new Jets (the <b>former</b> <b>Atlanta</b> Thrashers).

On September 14, 2013, Sanchez was placed on injured reserve with a designation to return.

500|$|Commented {{longtime}} <b>former</b> <b>Atlanta</b> Braves manager Bobby Cox on Bagwell – {{who opposed}} {{him from the}} dugout for the entirety of his career, including numerous times in the playoffs: [...] "Jeff Bagwell was [...] {{for so long and}} starred every year. [...] For me a guy that dominated like that for one team, even in the league stats through the years. [...] His are up there with anybody's. [...] I would put him in right away. [...] So he would get my vote on the first ballot." [...] Still, in spite of the speculation that Bagwell used performance-enhancing drugs, San Francisco Chronicle sportswriter Bruce Jenkins opined that Bagwell did not have the credentials to be in the Hall of Fame. [...] In July 2015, he acknowledged [...] "that many are suspicious of Bagwell—without proof, as you say. [...] I've always voted for the best players—Bonds, McGwire, Clemens, etc.—so that's not a factor for me. [...] I always found Bagwell just a bit short of Hall of Fame material." ...|$|E
