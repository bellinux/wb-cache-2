The aging veteran population in New Hampshire {{led to the}} addition of a residential nursing home and an ambulatory care wing in the late 1970s. Over the years several medical research centers were established, including one for post-traumatic stress disorder. The center originally had a 28-bed full-service hospital. Starting in 1999 the center eliminated its inpatient care services, and the center concentrated on urgent and primary care and on ambulatory and outpatient services. Following the closure, patients requiring a full-service hospital were sent to VA hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts, and White River Junction, Vermont. The center also established <b>in-patient</b> <b>treatment</b> contracts with non-VA hospitals in New Hampshire such as Concord Hospital.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the effects of <b>in-patient</b> {{multidisciplinary}} <b>treatment</b> with standard out-patient care in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Eighty patients with active RA were randomized to receive 11 days of <b>in-patient</b> multidisciplinary <b>treatment</b> followed by standard out-patient care (n = 39), or to standard out-patient care only (n = 41). Patients were assessed at baseline, and after 2, 4, 12 and 52 weeks. In the in-patients, the improvement in variables of disease activity (weeks 2 and 4) and emotional status (weeks 4 and 12) was greater when compared with the out-patients (P < 0. 05). The improvement in laboratory and functional measures did not differ between the groups. In the in-patient group, the percentage of patients responding to the American College of Rheumatology criteria for improvement was significantly greater at any time point during follow-up than in the out-patient group. A short period of <b>in-patient</b> multidisciplinary <b>treatment</b> for active RA has a direct beneficial effect on disease activity and emotional status with the favourable effect on disease activity remaining after 52 weeks.

40|$|ObjectiveLymphatic complications, such as lymphocutaneous fistula (LF) and lymphocele, are {{relatively}} uncommon after vascular procedures, but their treatment represents a serious challenge. Vacuum assisted closure (VAC) therapy {{has been reported}} to be an effective therapeutic option for LF, but the effectiveness of VAC therapy for lymphoceles is unclear. MethodsFor LF, we apply the VAC directly to the skin defect after extending it to achieve a clean wound of at least one inch in length. To treat lymphocele, we convert the lymphocele to a LF in a sterile fashion by making a one inch incision in the overlying skin and applying the VAC. The setting was a community teaching hospital. We used 10 patients that we treated with VAC therapy for LF (n = 4) and lymphoceles (n = 6). ResultsDuration of in-patient stay, duration of <b>in-patient</b> VAC <b>treatment,</b> duration of out-patient VAC treatment, total duration of VAC treatment. The median duration of in-patient stay was 4 (range, 0 - 18) days, the median duration of <b>in-patient</b> VAC <b>treatment</b> was 1 (range, 0 - 5) days, the median duration of out-patient VAC treatment was 16 (range, 7 - 28) days), and the median total duration of VAC therapy was 18 (range, 13 - 29) days. Successful wound healing was achieved in all patients with no recurrence after VAC removal. VAC therapy for treatment of both LFs and lymphoceles resulted in early control of drainage, rapid wound closure, and short hospital stays. ConclusionOur results suggest that VAC therapy is a convenient and effective therapeutic option for both LFs and lymphoceles...|$|R
40|$|Aims To {{develop the}} first psychometrically {{validated}} Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for in-patients (DTSQ-IP) and examine determinants of <b>in-patient</b> diabetes <b>treatment</b> satisfaction. Methods We studied 366 in-patients with insulin-treated diabetes {{at a single}} UK centre. We developed a 19 -item DTSQ-IP to assess <b>in-patient</b> diabetes <b>treatment</b> satisfaction, and collected data on in-patient length of stay (LOS) and in-patient care at the same time. Results Psychometric analyses including Principal Components Analysis and Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient showed that a single satisfaction score (excluding two items scored individually) can be computed for the entire DTSQ-IP, indicating very good internal consistency reliability (0. 92). The DTSQ-IP detected considerable dissatisfaction with meal choice and timing (13. 7 % of in-patients would never have chosen similar meals at home), and with in-patient hypoglycaemia (35. 3 % felt that their blood glucose was too low most of the time). In-patients on surgical wards, women, and those long established on insulin were significantly more dissatisfied, particularly with competence of hospital staff. Patients who administered their own insulin were not significantly less dissatisfied overall, but were so with the choice of meals (P = 0. 005). Multiple regression analysis produced a model accounting for 8. 2 % of variability in DTSQ-IP (r = 0. 29; P = 0. 0058) and 21. 7 % of variability in LOS (r = 0. 46; P = 0. 0001). Conclusions The DTSQ-IP is a novel, psychometrically validated and sensitive tool that adds to the DTSQ portfolio.

40|$|Background: The {{evaluation}} of local {{mental health care}} remains difficult. For this reason systematic development of appropriate services is barely possible. Methods: We examined involuntary hospitalization {{in the city of}} Frankfurt/Main with regard to diagnoses, socio-demographic data, complementary psychosocial outpatient care, and circumstances of hospitalization. There are four psychiatric clinics, each serving a catchment area of more than 165. 000 inhabitants. These clinics are responsible for all psychiatric <b>in-patient</b> <b>treatments</b> regardless of the admission modus. During a one year period, 677 patients were involuntarily hospitalized. Statistical analyses were performed subsequent to pooling the data. Results: During a period of one year, 103 out of 100. 000 inhabitants of Frankfurt/Main were admitted involuntarily. The rate of involuntary admissions related to all admissions was 10. 98 percent. Any complementary psychosocial care was missing in more than 70 percent of patients admitted involuntarily. Only about 10 percent of patients were examined by a physician before reaching the hospital and in disappointing 1. 3 percent the municipal mental health service had been consulted prior to involuntarily admission. Conclusion: Our results show that a systematic improvement of precautionary complementary psychosocial care for risk patients is needed as well as the obligation of psychiatric emergency consultation before involuntary hospitalization.
