5|$|Before, Beyoncé's {{approach}} to heartbreak was always literal, {{her voice and}} her words declaiming her <b>feelings</b> <b>with</b> a studied earnestness that at times was difficult to believe, let alone connect with. 'Irreplaceable' is the first song in which Beyoncé lies to herself, and the way her voice perfectly betrays that lie (revealing a giveaway tremble in the stiff upper lip of the lyrics) simultaneously renders it her most sophisticated and her most honest performance to date.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the {{character}} underwent {{a dramatic change}} in storyline when the role of Nick and Sharon's fourteen-year-old daughter Cassie was killed off after a car accident. This led Nick to seek comfort in the arms of another woman, Phyllis Summers, which resulted in an affair. Phyllis became pregnant with Nick's child, Summer Newman. Nick divorced Sharon and married Phyllis the following year. For years, however, Nick battled between his ongoing <b>feelings</b> <b>with</b> Sharon and Phyllis. His other storylines have included trying to seek independence away from his powerful father as well as multiple other relationships. In 2013, a storyline regarding Summer's paternity was visited, centered on speculation that she is actually the daughter of Jack Abbott, Phyllis' ex-husband.|$|E

5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} finds it difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get a place in the dance group, and has done things so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his <b>feelings</b> <b>with</b> violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E

25|$|The Republicans also imposed tariffs {{designed}} to protect the infant industries that had been created when Britain was blockading the U.S. With the collapse of the Federalists as a party, the adoption of many Federalist principles by the Republicans, and the systematic policy of President James Monroe in his two terms (1817–25) to downplay partisanship, the nation entered an Era of Good <b>Feelings,</b> <b>with</b> far less partisanship than before (or after), and closed out the First Party System.|$|E
25|$|Individuals low in reward {{dependence}} {{and high in}} norepinephrine levels are then hypothesized to be typically independent, non-conformist, practical, tough-minded, cynical, unwilling to share their intimate <b>feelings</b> <b>with</b> others, socially detached, irresolute, insensitive to social cues and pressures, and content to be alone. They are also minimally motivated to please others and act for immediate gratification. So being low in reward dependence is related to social withdrawal, with aggressive anti-social behavior, detachment, and coldness in social attitudes.|$|E

25|$|Scheff {{suggests}} that ritual provides catharsis, emotional purging, through distancing. This emotional distancing enables {{an individual to}} experience <b>feelings</b> <b>with</b> an amount of separation, and thus less intensity. However, the conception of religious ritual as an interactive process has since matured and become more scientifically established. From this view, ritual offers a means to catharsis through behaviors that foster connection with others, allowing for emotional expression. This focus on connection contrasts to the separation that seems to underlie Scheff’s view.|$|E

25|$|Successful {{therapeutic}} {{relationships between}} nurses and patients {{need to have}} positive support. Different methods of providing patients with support include many active responses. Minor activities such as shopping, reading the newspaper together, or taking lunch/dinner breaks with patients can {{improve the quality of}} support provided. Physical support may also be used and is manifested through the use of touch. Patients described feelings of connection when the psychiatric nurses hugged them or put a hand on their shoulder. Psychiatric/mental health nurses in Berg and Hallberg's study described an element of a working relationship as comforting through holding a patient's hand. Patients with depression described relief when the psychiatric nurse embraced them. Physical touch is intended to comfort and console patients who are willing to embrace these sensations and share mutual <b>feelings</b> <b>with</b> the psychiatric nurses.|$|E

25|$|Klaas A. Posthuma {{argues that}} neither Tristan nor Isolde try {{for one moment}} to ignore their {{feelings}} of {{love for each other}} nor do they try to overcome them. On the contrary, they yield to their <b>feelings</b> <b>with</b> all their hearts – but secretly. This has nothing whatsoever to do with the Schopenhauer doctrine. Another important point in this philosophy is Schopenhauer's opinion about finding happiness with one woman only, which he rejected – his reason for never marrying. But for Tristan there is only one woman, Isolde, with Death as alternative. And this leads to the inevitable conclusion that it was not Schopenhauer and his doctrine that were responsible for the creation of Wagner's sublime music drama but his unfulfilled love for the woman he met and loved during these years, Mathilde Wesendonck.|$|E
25|$|The {{overall effect}} of Reichart's {{literary}} techniques indicate Hilde's estrangement of painful memories, her obsession with guilt and self-loathing, {{her inability to}} resolve anxiety, and the inadequacy of words to capture her <b>feelings.</b> <b>With</b> these devices, Reichart allows the reader to see inside the mind of an extremely disturbed woman. For Reichart, Hilde and her siblings embody the war-time generation: Walter, who helped to hack to death the prisoners in the barn; Monika, who was too delicate and fragile to act; Hannes, who refused to kill the prisoner and tried to save him; and Hilde, who was confused {{and did not know}} to whom she could go for help. The father, a violent and bitter man, made his family suffer and was indeed complicit in their suffering; the mother, worked hard but said nothing; the distant sister, Christine, was removed from the chaos. The home was no sanctuary, not for the escaped prisoner, nor for Hilde; Pesendorf betrayed the brother—indeed, the family—and killed the prisoner. The home was as dangerous and bloody as the barn.|$|E
25|$|Cheuk Man Lai Jackie and {{her family}} – Lai is a 26-year-old woman. She started off as a {{controversial}} chain-smoking model, with a violent husband who she had no more <b>feelings</b> <b>with.</b> However, she continued to respect her husband's father and tried to conceal the details about her affair with Yat. After her divorce with her husband, she entered the Tong family, but very few people accepted her, including Hau. After the realisation of her mistakes, Hau accepts her. After she is accepted into the family and through thorough teachings from Hau, she matures to become a woman who loves the Tong family greatly and to be thankful all that she has in life. Lai's family, in return, is a complete contrast to her. As extremely greedy people, they use the Tong family as a bank, and took $5,000,000 HKD in one visit to fund the restaurant that Hau offered them {{as a gift for}} Yat and Lai's marriage. Lai's family ultimately combine with Kam and Duk's plot to obtain a share of the Tong assets. They are hated by the Tong's including Lai herself. They never regret their mistakes, even by the end. Tong Sum is the baby girl born to Jackie and Gilbert.|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft dedicates {{significant}} {{portions of}} Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark to descriptions {{of nature and}} her emotional responses to it. One of her most effective tactics is to associate a set of thoughts and <b>feelings</b> <b>with</b> a specific natural formation, such as the waterfall passage quoted above. Nature, Wollstonecraft assumes, is [...] "a common reference point" [...] between readers and herself, therefore her letters should generate a sense of social sympathy with them. Many of the letters contain these [...] "miniature Romantic excursus" [...] which illustrate Wollstonecraft's ideas regarding the connections between nature, God, and the self. The natural world becomes [...] "the necessary ground of speculation and the crucial field of experience".|$|E
