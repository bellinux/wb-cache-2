5000|$|<b>Gamma-cyhalothrin</b> is {{a single}} {{stereoisomer}} of the pyrethroid insecticide cyhalothrin, and as such shares physical, chemical, and biological properties with both cyhalothrin and lambda-cyhalothrin, which are mixtures of 4 and 2 isomers respectively. <b>Gamma-cyhalothrin</b> is the most insecticidally active isomer of cyhalothrin/lambda-cyhalothrin, and thus the technical <b>gamma-cyhalothrin</b> product may be considered a refined form of cyhalothrin/lambda-cyhalothrin in {{that it has been}} purified by removal of less active and inactive isomers. Thus, similar levels of insecticidal efficacy for <b>gamma-cyhalothrin</b> can be obtained with significantly reduced application rates as compared with either cyhalothrin or lambda-cyhalothrin. The tolerance under 40 CFR 180.438 currently identifies lambda-cyhalothrin as a 1:1 mixture of two isomers and their epimers, one of which is the gamma isomer. The gamma isomer is present at 42% in this mixture. By contrast in the proposed tolerance expression the gamma isomer is present at 98% in the mixture. [...] Home Depot carries a brand of the <b>gamma-cyhalothrin</b> insecticide under the brand name Spectracide Triazacide.|$|E
50|$|The {{sunflower}} beetle {{is considered}} {{to be one of the}} most damaging defoliators of cultivated sunflowers in North America. Advice published by Kansas State University in 2016 recommends the use of insecticide treatment of sunflower crops if any of the following conditions are met: one adult beetle is present per seedling, larvae reach numbers of 10-15 per plant on upper leaves, or 25 percent defoliation occurs and pupation has not begun. Given the short larval and adult lifecycle, delayed planting of sunflower crops is effective in preventing yield reductions caused by sunflower beetle. Recommended insecticides for infested crops include: Beta-cyfluthrin, Carbaryl, Deltamethrin, Esfenvalerate, <b>Gamma-cyhalothrin,</b> Lambda-cyhalothrin, and Zeta-cypermethrin.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the synergy and response homogeneity of the Spodoptera frugiperda larvae population to the Piper aduncum essential oil in combination with pyrethroid insecticides (alpha-cypermethrin, beta-cypermethrin, fenpropathrin, and <b>gamma-cyhalothrin)</b> compared to piperonylbutoxide (PBO) as positive control. Synergism (SF) comparisons were obtained using lethal concentration (LC 50) and lethal dose (LD 50) ratios of insecticides individually and in their respective synergistic combinations with essential oil and PBO. Dose/concentration-mortality slope curves were used to establish relative toxicity increase promoted by synergism. They also determined homogeneity response. Residual contact revealed significant potentiation for commercial insecticides formulated with beta-cypermethrin (SF= 9. 05 - 0. 5) and fenpropathrin (SF= 34. 05 - 49. 77) when combined with the P. aduncum essential oil. For topical contact, significant potentiation occurred only for alpha-cypermethrin (SF= 7. 55 - 3. 68), fenpropathrin (SF= 3. 37 - 1. 21), and <b>gamma-cyhalothrin</b> (SF= 5. 79 - 10. 48) insecticides when combined with essential oil. With the exception of fenpropathrin and <b>gamma-cyhalothrin,</b> insecticides synergistic combinations presented homogeneous response by topical as well as residual contact at least with essential oil. The SF significance values ​​of the P. aduncum essential oil combined with alpha-cypermethrin, beta-cypermethrin, fenpropathrin, and <b>gamma-cyhalothrin</b> insecticides indicated potential for this oil to be used as an alternative to PBO...|$|E
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of six Australian {{broiler house}} populations and an insecticide susceptible population of lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), to cyfluthrin, beta-cyfluthrin, <b>gamma-cyhalothrin,</b> and deltamethrin was investigated. One broiler house population had equivalent susceptibility to the susceptible to beta-cyfluthrin and <b>gamma-cyhalothrin,</b> with higher susceptibility to cyfluthrin and deltamethrin. The remaining five populations demonstrated strong resistance to cyfluthrin (19 - 37 -fold), the insecticide used most widely for management of A. diaperinus in Australia. Each cyfluthrin-resistant population demonstrated reduced susceptibility to beta-cyfluthrin (resistance ratios were 8 - 17 -fold), deltamethrin (2. 5 - 8 -fold), and <b>gamma-cyhalothrin</b> (6 - 12 -fold) {{compared with the}} laboratory population, but cross-resistance patterns varied considerably between populations. Adding piperonyl butoxide (PBO) {{had no effect on}} the susceptibility of the susceptible population to any of the insecticides, but it increased the susceptibility of each of the five cyfluthrin-resistant populations: to cyfluthrin (synergism ratio range, 1. 9 - 5. 0 -fold), beta-cyfluthrin (1. 6 - 4. 1 -fold), and <b>gamma-cyhalothrin</b> (1. 7 - 2. 0 -fold). PBO had a more variable effect on susceptibility to deltamethrin, with three of the cyfluthrin-resistant populations being more susceptible to deltamethrin in the presence of PBO, but susceptibility of the remaining two populations was unaffected by adding PBO (synergism ratio range, 0. 9 - 2. 5 -fold). Overall, the addition of PBO to the four pyrethroids had variable effects on their susceptibility. This variability indicated the presence of other resistance mechanisms in beetle populations apart from metabolic resistance. In addition, the relative importance of metabolic resistance in each beetle population varied widely between pyrethroids. Thus, it cannot be assumed that PBO will reliably synergize pyrethroids against cyfluthrin-resistant lesser mealworm populations when using it to mitigate insecticide resistance...|$|E
40|$|Huanglongbing (HLB) is {{a disease}} {{associated}} with the bacteria "Candidatus Liberibacter spp. " and has been devastating citrus orchards around the world. Its management involves control of the insect vector, the Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri Kuwayama. However, the indiscriminate use of chemicals has caused pest outbreaks and eliminated the natural enemies of the vector, such as the parasitoid Tamarixia radiata (Waterston), the main agent for biological control of D. citri. This study assessed the lethal and sublethal effects of insecticides recommended for integrated production of citrus on the parasitoid T. radiata. When adult parasitoids were exposed to residues of 25 insecticides, 20 % of them, i. e., <b>gamma-cyhalothrin,</b> etofenprox, azadirachtin, tebufenozide and pyriproxyfen, were considered as harmless (Class 1), 12 % as slightly harmful (Class 2), 12 % as moderately harmful (Class 3) and 56 % as harmful (Class 4), according to the classification proposed by the IOBC/WPRS. Afterward, 14 insecticides (5 harmless and 9 harmful) were sprayed on the parasitoid pupae. Of the 14 insecticides tested, only the organophosphates dimethoate and chlorpyrifos affected the parasitoid emergence. The effects of insecticides on the parasitism capacity of adults exposed to residues of azadirachtin, etofenprox, <b>gamma-cyhalothrin,</b> pyriproxyfen and tebufenozide (harmless) were also evaluated. Tebufenozide and <b>gamma-cyhalothrin</b> affected the parasitism of the F 0 generation, but {{did not affect the}} emergence of the F 1 and F 2 generations. Therefore, for an effective IPM program, selective insecticides or harmful pesticides to adult parasitoids could be used in the field, provided that the adults do not occur naturally and the chemical applications do not coincide with parasitoid releases...|$|E
40|$|Podisus nigrispinus (Dallas) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) is an {{important}} biological control agent of the cotton leafworm [Alabama argillacea (Hübner) ] in the cotton crops in Brazil. The use of selective products such as pyrethroids has been emphasized in this agroecosystem. Then, the susceptibility of the predatory stinkbug P. nigrispinus to the pyrethroid insecticide <b>gamma-cyhalothrin</b> was studied in the laboratory. Nymphs and adults of the predator were exposed to seven concentrations of the <b>gamma-cyhalothrin</b> via topical contact and ingestion through treated water.

Levels of oxidative stress parameters glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and lipid peroxidation were determined. Eggs of newly fertilised common carp {{were exposed to}} Nexide at concentrations 5, 25, 50, 100, and 250 [*]μg[*]L- 1 (0. 3, 1. 5, 3, 6, and 15 [*]μg[*]L- 1 <b>gamma-cyhalothrin).</b> All organisms exposed to concentrations higher than 50 [*]μg[*]L- 1 died soon after hatching; at 25 [*]μg[*]L- 1, 95 % mortality was recorded.

40|$|Agricultural organisms, such as insect herbivores, provide unique {{opportunities}} for studies of adaptive evolutionary processes, including effects of insecticides on movement and oviposition behavior. In this study, Brassica leaves {{were treated with}} one of two non-systemic insecticides and exposed to two individual strains (referred to as single or double resistance) of diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) (DBM) exhibiting physiological resistance. Behavioral responses by these two strains were compared as part of characterizing the relative effect of levels of physiological resistance on the likelihood of insects showing signs of behavioral avoidance. For each DBM strain, we used choice bioassays to quantify two possible types of behavioral avoidance: 1) females ovipositing predominantly on leaf surfaces without insecticides, and 2) larvae avoiding insecticide-treated leaf surfaces. In three-choice bioassays (leaves with no pesticide, 50 % coverage with pesticide, or 100 % coverage with pesticide), females from the single resistance DBM strain laid significantly more eggs on water treated leaves compared to leaves with 100 % insecticide coverage (both <b>gamma-cyhalothrin</b> and spinetoram). Females from the double resistance DBM strain also laid significantly more eggs on water treated leaves compared to leaves with 100 % <b>gamma-cyhalothrin,</b> while moths did not adjust their oviposition behavior in response to spinetoram. Larvae from the single resistance DBM strain showed {{a significant increase in}} mobility in response to both insecticides and avoided insecticide-treated portions of leaves when given a choice. On the other hand, DBM larvae from the double resistance strain showed a significant decrease in mobility in response to insecticides, and they did not avoid insecticide-treated portions of leaves when given a choice. Our results suggest that pest populations with physiological resistance may show behavioral avoidance, as resistant females avoided oviposition on leaves without <b>gamma-cyhalothrin.</b> Thus, physiological resistance and behavioral avoidance {{do not appear to be}} controlled by the same selection pressures, and the mechanisms responsible for behavioral avoidance may vary among life stages. Our analysis also suggested that a population with lesser physiological resistance to insecticides may be under a stronger selection pressure and therefore be more likely to develop avoidance behaviors than a population with higher levels of physiological resistance...|$|E

40|$|A store {{survey of}} four large home {{improvement}} stores in {{northern and southern}} California was conducted to identify active ingredients in pesticide products for outdoor use. A total of 190 outdoor use products and 79 active ingredients were identified. Glyphosate, 2, 4 -D dimethylamine salt, imidacloprid, dicamba dimethylamine salt, bifenthrin, permethrin, and lambda–cyhalothrin were the most prevalent chemicals in retail products. Insecticides represented {{more than half of}} the products available, with pyrethroids representing 46 % of the insecticidal products. Natural products and biopesticides represented 17 % of active ingredients. Northern California stores sold more ready-to-use formulations of products than the Southern California stores and had more than twice as many products containing lambda-cyhalothrin. Also, the pyrethroid cypermethrin was absent from all products sold in Southern California. Comparisons to a 2003 survey conducted by the University of California revealed that diazinon, which has been phased out in California, is no longer found in any products. <b>Gamma-cyhalothrin,</b> a chemical registered for use in 2005 and not found in the 2003 survey, is now an active ingredient in multiple products...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} {{of a range}} of freshwater lentic invertebrates to <b>gamma-cyhalothrin</b> (GCH), a single enantiomer of the synthetic pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin, was assessed in single species laboratory tests and an outdoor multi-species ecosystem test. The most sensitive species in the laboratory single species tests with GCH was Chaoborus obscuripes (96 h EC 50 : 3. 8 ng/l). The species sensitivity distribution curve, based on the laboratory 96 h EC 50 acute toxicity data for eight species, gave a median HC 5 value for GCH of 2. 12 ng/l. The NOECcommunity derived from the multi-species ecosystem test was 5 ng/l, and the insects Chaoborus sp. and Caenis sp. were identified as the most sensitive species. The results indicate that the median HC 5, based on eight species selected to include those known to be sensitive to pyrethroids, provided a good estimation of the NOECcommunity for GCH. Furthermore, the results for GCH indicated that the endpoints typically used in higher-tier risk assessments for pesticides in Europe (HC 5 and NOECcommunity) were consistent with expectations when compared to the equivalent endpoints for the racemate LC...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid single-drop microextraction method coupled with gas {{chromatography}} and mass spectrometry (SDME-GC/MS) for {{the determination of}} 20 pesticides with different physicochemical properties in grapes and apples was optimized {{by the use of}} a multivariate strategy. Emphasis on the optimization study was given to the role of ionic strength, sugar concentration and pH of the donor sample solution prepared from the fruit samples. Since all three variables were found to affect negatively SDME (a lower extraction efficiency was observed as the values of variables were increased for most of the pesticides studied), donor sample solution was optimized using a central composite design to evaluate the optimum pH value and the optimum dilution of the sample extract. With some exceptions (chlorpyrifos ethyl, alpha-endosulfan, beta-endosulfan, pyriproxyfen, <b>gamma-cyhalothrin</b> and bifenthrin), the optimum method included the dilution of the analytical sample by 12. 5 -fold with a buffered acetone/water solution at pH = 4 and exhibited good analytical characteristics for the majority of target analytes (pyrimethanil, pirimicarb, metribuzin, vinclozolin, fosthiazate, procymidone, fludioxonil, kresoxim methyl, endosulfan sulfate, fenhexamid, iprodione, phosalone, indoxacarb and azoxystrobin) by providing high enrichment factors (14 - 328), low limits of detection (0. 0003 - 0. 007 mu g/g), and good precision (relative standard deviations below 15 %).

40|$|The Brazilian citrus {{culture is}} the second largest {{pesticides}} consumer, demanding roughly 17. 5 kg of active ingredient per hectare annually. This research evaluated the physiological selectivity of 50 pesticides (22 insecticides, 16 acaricides, 10 fungicides, 1 mineral oil and 1 vegetable oil) used in citrus on parasitoid Tamarixia radiata. For that purpose, discs of the Valencia sweet orange variety, 3. 5 cm diameter were sprayed using a Burkhard-Pottertower adjusted to a pressure of 15 lb. pol- 2, enabling the application of 1. 8 ± 0. 1 mg of chemical solution. cm- 2, according to the methodology proposed by IOBC/WPRS. After application, the discs were kept {{at room temperature for}} three hours to dry the residues. Next, the discs were placed in Petri dishes containing 2 mL of a not gelled agar-water solution at 2. 5 %. Then, adult parasitoids with no more than 48 hours after emergence were exposed to residues. The experimental design was completely randomized with 51 treatments and five replicates, and each replication comprised 10 adults of the parasitoid.

40|$|Pyrethroids {{are ones}} {{of the most}} used {{pesticides}} worldwides. The widespread use and high stability of pyrethroids lead to the assumption of that their occurrence in the environment could be quite frequent. They can reach water ecosystem as pollutants. Residues of pyrethroids are not only detected in the water column, but also in sediments and in fish tissues. The first study was devoted to the product Nexide containing 60 g. l- 1 of active substance <b>gamma-cyhalothrin.</b> Tested Nexide concentrations were 5, 25, 50, 100, and 250 µg. l- 1. Early life stage test was used. Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) was tested. There were significant mortalities in all concentrations except the lowest concentration during the trial. The lowest concentration tested 5 µg. l- 1 only caused a slightly increased mortality. This lowest concentration influenced the growth in length and weight negatively, decelerated ontogenetic development, and made the body surface of the individuals darker. Histopathology of individuals from this concentration revealed dystrophy in liver. Examination of kidney, intestine and gills did not show significant histopathological differences compared with control. The evaluation of selected parameters of oxidative stress demonstrated a significantly higher activity of detoxification enzyme glutathione-S. transferase (GST) and a significantly lower activity of defensive enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GPx) compared with the control group. The other examined parameters of oxidative stress such as catalase (CAT), glutation reductase (GR), and lipid peroxidation determined by using the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARs) were comparable to the control group. Changes in oxidative stress parameters suggest that exposure of the organism to the product Nexide in the given concentration leads to dysbalance of defensive enzymes. The second study was devoted to the product Cyperkill 25 EC containing 250 g. l- 1. Tested Cyperkill 25 EC concentrations were 7. 2, 36, 72, 144, and 360 µg. l- 1. The procedure of the trial {{was the same as}} the preceded one. There were 100 % mortalities in all concentrations except the lowest concentration during the trial. The lowest tested concentration 7. 2 µg. l- 1 allowed 90 % of individuals to stay alive till the end of experiment. The lowest concentration influenced the growth in length and weight negatively and decelerated ontogenetic development compared with the control. Any individual exposed to this concentration did not reach juvenile stage {{until the end of the}} trial. Dark pigmentation was visible in 68 % of these exposed individuals on the last day. Similar darkening was visible in individuals from higher concentrations shortly before death too. Histological examination did not revealed significant changes in intestine, liver, kidney, and gills compared with the control group. Evaluation of selected parameters of oxidative stress demonstrated significantly lower activities of GST, GR, and GPx. Activities of CAT and TBARS were comparable with the control group. Changes in oxidative stress parameters suggest that exposure of the organism to the product Cyperkill 25 EC in the given concentration could induce oxidative stress and interfere with the activities of antioxidant enzymes. The presented thesis summarises actual data about pyrethroids and their influence on fish. The demonstrated effects confirm high susceptibility of early developmental stages of fish to tested pesticides. When interpreting the results, we have to take into account the fact that studies showed this risk even on single pyrethroid substances. But water organisms are exposed to many other more or less toxic products and substances in a real environment. These xenobiotics could react with each other and their mixture could even potentiate negative effects. The performed studies also clearly show the significant differences in the sensitivity of embryonic and embryolarval tests...|$|E
