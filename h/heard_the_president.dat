60|$|He {{held his}} ground, however, though {{he saw that}} he had various rivals for the right of speech. He held his ground, and was {{instantly}} aware that he had gained his point. There was a slight pause, and as some other urgent member did not reseat himself, Phineas <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of that august assembly call upon himself to address the House. The thing was now to be done. There he was with the House of Commons at his feet,--a crowded House, bound to be his auditors as long as he should think fit to address them, and reporters by tens and twenties in the gallery ready and eager to let the country know what the young member for Loughshane would say in this his maiden speech.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was just}} as he heard these words, uttered by her {{companion}} in reply, that Count Otto checked himself, turned away and pretended {{to be looking for}} a cup of tea. It wasn't usual to disturb the President, even simply to shake hands, when he was sitting on a sofa with a lady, and the young secretary felt it in this case less possible than ever to break the rule, for the lady on the sofa was none other than Pandora Day. He had recognised her without her appearing to see him, and even with half an eye, as they said, had taken in that she was now a person to be reckoned with. She had an air of elation, of success; she shone, to intensity, in her rose- coloured dress; she was extracting promises from the ruler of fifty millions of people. What an odd place to meet her, her old shipmate thought, and how little one could tell, after all, in America, who people were! He didn't want to speak to her yet; he wanted to wait a little and learn more; but meanwhile there was something attractive in {{the fact that she was}} just behind him, a few yards off, that if he should turn he might see her again. It was she Mrs. Bonnycastle had meant, it was she who was so much admired in New York. Her face was the same, yet he had made out in a moment that she was vaguely prettier; he had recognised the arch of her nose, which suggested a fine ambition. He took some tea, which he hadn't desired, in order not to go away. He remembered her entourage on the steamer; her father and mother, the silent senseless burghers, so little [...] "of the world," [...] her infant sister, so much of it, her humorous brother with his tall hat and his influence in the smoking- room. He remembered Mrs. Dangerfield's warnings--yet her perplexities too--and the letter from Mr. Bellamy, and the introduction to Mr. Lansing, and the way Pandora had stooped down on the dirty dock, laughing and talking, mistress of the situation, to open her trunk for the Customs. He was pretty sure she had paid no duties that day; this would naturally have been the purpose of Mr. Bellamy's letter. Was she still in correspondence with that gentleman, and had he got over the sickness interfering with their reunion? These images and these questions coursed through Count Otto's mind, and he saw it must be quite in Pandora's line to be mistress of the situation, for there was evidently nothing on the present occasion that could call itself her master. He drank his tea and as; he put down his cup <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> behind him, say: [...] "Well, I guess my wife will wonder why I don't come home." ...|$|E

He had heard him criticised and reviled and praised, just as is every man who goes to the White House, be he saint or sinner.

5|$|Garfield {{had been}} a regular visitor to the shore town of Long Branch, NJ, one of the nation’s premier summer {{vacation}} spots until World War I.

When they <b>heard</b> that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> was being brought to their town, local citizens built more than half a mile of tracks in less than 24 hours, enabling Garfield to be brought directly {{to the door of the}} oceanfront Franklyn cottage, rather than being moved by carriage from the local Elberon train station. However, Garfield died 12 days later. A granite marker on Garfield Rd identifies the former site of the cottage, which was demolished in 1950.|$|R

On {{the day of}} the election, Catalan newspaper La Vanguardia published an interview in which Patapievici was asked about a video recording that had been repeatedly broadcast in Romanian media and which allegedly depicted Băsescu hitting a 10-year-old boy. Patapievici said that he thought Băsescu only pushed the child, and that Băsescu's error was that he did not deny it immediately. Patapievici then compared the incident with the Lewinsky scandal, and, to illustrate his view that Băsescu was a good man, added that he had <b>heard</b> that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> Traian Băsescu had refused to use a tape offered to his campaign that reputedly depicted political opponent Mircea Geoană receiving sexual favors.|$|R

5000|$|One singer Arthur Judson did not {{represent}} (but probably should have) was Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman. In 1948, Margaret's agent, James A.

Margaret told her father what she had <b>heard,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>president</b> requested <b>the</b> Federal Bureau of Investigation investigate. In October 1955, the United States Department of Justice filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Columbia along with three other defendants were charged with restraint of interstate trade and commerce in the booking of artists, and also with monopolizing organized audience associations. The agencies pleaded no contest and were forced to release their monopoly position. By this time, Arthur Judson had been replaced at Columbia by Ward French.|$|R
40|$|Every spring, {{with great}} pomp and circumstance, Israel celebrates the {{contribution}} of the reservists to the country’s security, and political and military leaders laud {{the contribution of}} reserve soldiers to national security. In 2011, however, discordant notes marred the festive event, namely the ongoing protest by organizations of reservists about the gap between the nation’s commitments and their fulﬁllment. The protest by reservists was <b>heard</b> while <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of Israel and the IDF Chief of Staff visited the Ze’elim training base and during a stormy debate in the Knesset. The IDF reserves, formerly the backbone of the military’s force, is now at a crossroads, and it appears that even the IDF command and the political echelon are not sure how to reshape it. This essay argues that a combination of political and economic costs involved in operating the reserves is accelerating the decline of this force, and is part of the general move towards the transformation of the IDF from conscript to professional army...|$|R

But <b>the</b> <b>President</b> was set. His arms and legs had been spliced by the surgeons to a certain posture, and they must be broken again before they could be altered. To his horror, Mr. Lloyd George, desiring at the last moment all the moderation he dared, discovered that he could not in five days persuade <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of error in what it had taken five months to prove to him to be just and right.

He also wrote poetry, fiction, and drama, and painted, and he researched the life and political thought of 19th-century South American revolutionary Simón Bolívar. He also became interested in the Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara (1928-67) after reading his memoir The Diary of Che Guevara. In 1974, he was selected to be a representative in the commemorations for the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Ayacucho in Peru, the conflict in which Simon Bolívar's lieutenant, Antonio José de Sucre, defeated royalist forces during the Peruvian War of Independence.

5000|$|Five {{generations of}} the Taft family {{descendants}} lived at Elmshade. A number of them had powerful political and legal careers, including George S. Taft, Bezaleel Jr's son. George was a lawyer, District Attorney and private secretary, chief of staff, to U.S. Senator George Hoar in the 1880s. His influence probably led to the Lincoln Square, Worcester Court House being erected., The [...] "Life of Alphonso Taft by Lewis Alexander Leonard", on Google Books, is a particularly rich source {{of the history of}} the Taft family in Massachusetts. Elmshade was the site of Taft family reunions such as in 1874. Young William Howard Taft visited this home with his father Alphonso Taft, U.S. Secretary of War and founder of Skull and Bones at Yale. Alphonso Taft, who also served as United States Attorney General under President Ulysses S. Grant, delivered a powerful oratory on the Taft family and its roots in this area at this historic home during the reunion in 1874. Young William Howard Taft, and his brother Charles Phelps Taft, who founded the Chicago Cubs, both likely <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> speech. <b>President</b> William Howard Taft again visited this area, and this home, as a youth when he spent summers and even a term of school in Millbury. He would return here many years later as <b>the</b> American <b>President</b> to visit his kinfolk. The New York Times recorded President Taft's visits to his ancestral homes in Mendon and Uxbridge during his Presidency.|$|R
