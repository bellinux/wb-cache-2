50|$|<b>Elaidinization</b> is a {{chemical}} reaction which alters {{the orientation of}} double-bonds from cis- to trans-. It is most often performed on fats and oils to increase both the melting point and the shelf life without reducing the degree of unsaturation. The typical product of <b>elaidinization</b> is trans fat.|$|E
50|$|<b>Elaidinization</b> of oleic acid, {{a common}} {{component}} of vegetable oils, yields its trans-isomer elaidic acid.|$|E
50|$|It also {{occurs in}} small amounts in caprine and bovine milk (very roughly 0.1% of the fatty acids). and some meats. It is the trans isomer of oleic acid. The name of the <b>elaidinization</b> {{reaction}} comes from elaidic acid.|$|E
50|$|The {{stereoisomer}} of {{oleic acid}} is called elaidic acid or trans-9-octadecenoic acid. These isomers have distinct physical properties and biochemical properties. Elaidic acid, {{the most abundant}} trans fatty acid in diet, appears to have an adverse effect on health. A reaction that converts oleic acid to elaidic acid is called <b>elaidinization.</b>|$|E
