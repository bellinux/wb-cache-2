40|$|AbstractCooking over {{open fire}} with solid fuels results in {{incomplete}} combustion and {{indoor air pollution}} (IAP) causing respiratory and other diseases leading to nearly two million premature deaths per year. In urban areas, IAP interacts with outdoor pollutants in toxic chemical mixtures affecting also other citizens and damaging regional air quality in terms of 'brown clouds'. Deaths result mainly in women, children and infants, who are directly exposed <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> in unventilated kitchens, thus reflecting differentiated and unequal impacts across population groups. Despite the heavy health burden and discomfort, IAP has only recently been recognised as associated with neglected diseases. In search of synergies between adaptation and mitigation, we seek gender sensitive social innovations <b>to</b> <b>halt</b> <b>smoke,</b> soot and early death while reducing deforestation and carbon emissions. Using transition arenas as a participatory method for experiments and social learning we engaged with local entrepreneurs and peasant farmers in sub-Saharan Africa to initiate co-production of efficient flue-piped stoves that save energy, labour and lives. Findings indicate that successful design, production and adoption of improved cooking stoves is possible, but the structural challenges of poverty, inequality and distrust may inhibit further diffusion and more profound processes of social learning. Insights from local studies must therefore be contextualised into broader understandings, as attempted here, while local adoption must be combined with wider initiatives and government policies into complex micro-to-macro solutions that provide forceful effects against IAP and its drivers...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{indicate}} that while suppressing smoking thoughts increases subsequent smoking, {{it may have}} no impact on desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke.</b> However, previous research has examined suppression of general smoking thoughts rather than thoughts specifically related <b>to</b> desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke.</b> The present study investigated whether suppression of thoughts of desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> results in subsequently elevated ratings of desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke.</b> An experimental study {{examined the effects of}} suppressing thoughts of desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke,</b> versus expressing thoughts of desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke,</b> versus a control group thinking about anything, on ratings of desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> and tobacco withdrawal symptoms at four time points (before manipulations, just after manipulations, 5 min after, 10 min after). In addition, effects of suppressing thoughts of desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> on subsequent reports of thoughts of desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> were examined. Suppressing the thoughts of desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> caused thought rebound (i. e., greater subsequent reports of thoughts of desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke).</b> However, compared with control groups, this suppression did not elevate subsequent ratings of desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke.</b> Suppressing the thoughts of desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> does not elevate subsequent ratings of this desire. Increased cigarette consumption following suppression of smoking thoughts may be mediated by mechanisms other than increased desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke...</b>|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has indicated that adolescents who intend <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> differ from those who do not intend <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> in the imagery they associate with smoking. The present study examined relationships among self-image, ideal self-image, image of smokers in general and image of models in cigarette ads for seventh-grade students. The strongest finding was a positive correspondence of smokers image to self-image in predicting intention <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> cigarettes. This correspondence between smokers image and self-image derived from a relative depression of self-image in combination with a relative elevation of smokers image for youth who {{were more likely to report}} intentions <b>to</b> <b>smoke.</b> There was also a trend for the ideal self-image of youth with greater intentions <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>to</b> be similarly depressed.

40|$|Differences were {{examined}} in Theory of Planned Behaviour determinants of students' intention <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> including parents' attitudes towards smoking and parents' current cigarette use among Greek students of different school grade levels. Students (N = 763) aged 10 - 18 years reported their attitudes towards smoking, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, self-identity and intention <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> while their parents (N = 525) reported their attitudes towards smoking and their current cigarette use. All the TPB variables increased from lower to higher school grade level. Multi-sample path analyses showed that parent's attitudes towards smoking positively predicted students' intention <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> only for elementary school children. Parents' current cigarette use did not contribute significantly. Students' attitudes, perceived behavioural control and self-identity predicted systematically intention <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> in contrast <b>to</b> the subjective norm that did not contribute at all. Perceived behavioural control contributed to a higher degree in intention <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> for senior high school students compared to the junior high school and elementary students.

40|$|RATIONALE: Suppressing smoking {{thoughts}} {{has been}} shown to result in elevated smoking. However, the effect of suppressing smoking thoughts on desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> and withdrawal symptoms has not been investigated. OBJECTIVES: We examined the effects of suppressing smoking thoughts on the subsequent desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> and on tobacco withdrawal symptoms, relative to groups that were either thinking about anything they wished or actively thinking about smoking. METHODS: A randomised experimental study compared the effects of three manipulations (suppressed smoking thoughts, expressed smoking thoughts and thoughts of anything they wished) on desire and withdrawal immediately after the manipulation and 5 and 10  min after. RESULTS: Suppressing smoking thoughts did not result in elevated subsequent desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke,</b> relative <b>to</b> the other manipulations. Suppressing smoking thoughts resulted in a significant elevation in hunger ratings, relative to the other manipulations, at all measurement times. There were no significant effects for the other withdrawal symptoms. Self-reported greater use of thought suppression in everyday life was significantly associated with greater desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> at baseline and was associated with lower mindfulness scores. CONCLUSIONS: Laboratory-instructed suppression of smoking thoughts is associated with increased reports of hunger but did not lead to increases in other withdrawal symptoms or elevated desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke.</b> Reports of everyday use of thought suppression are associated with elevated desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> at baseline. Further investigations need to assess the effect of suppressing smoking cravings, instead of general smoking thoughts, on desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> and tobacco withdrawal...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Single-item urges <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> {{measures}} have been contemplated as important measures of nicotine dependence This study aimed to prospectively determine the relationships between measures of craving <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> and smoking cessation, and compare their ability to predict cessation with the Heaviness of Smoking Index, an established measure of nicotine dependence. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the randomised controlled PORTSSS trial. Measures of nicotine dependence, ascertained before making a quit attempt, were the HSI, frequency of urges <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> (FUTS) and strength of urges <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> (SUTS). Self-reported abstinence at six months after quitting was the primary outcome measure.

40|$|Background. Adolescents 2 ̆ 7 {{intentions}} <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> {{are generally}} regarded as a valid and reliable predictor of subsequent smoking. This association is largely based on research with adults and needs a more detailed analysis for adolescents. Methods. Data on intentions and smoking status were collected {{as part of a}} longitudinal, birth-cohort study when the study members were 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, and 21 years of age. Results. The results showed that intention <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> only had an important predictive power in the subgroup of previous nonsmokers. Among those already smoking (on a monthly basis or greater), previous level of smoking was a more important predictor of future behavior than intention <b>to</b> <b>smoke.</b> In addition, the effect of positive intention <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> was nonlinear over age and had the greatest effect at age 15. Conclusion. The results indicated that in adolescence, measurement of intentions <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> or not smoke cannot be assumed to be a general predictor of behavior at a later age for all groups of adolescents.

40|$|Objective To compare {{adolescents}} {{with and without}} cancer on current smoking status, inten-tions <b>to</b> <b>smoke,</b> and tobacco-related risk factors. Methods Ninety adolescents undergoing treatment for cancer (median time since diagnosis was 2. 4 months) and a comparison sample of 279 {{adolescents with}}out cancer, ages 12 to 18 years, completed questionnaires that asked about their smoking habits, intentions <b>to</b> <b>smoke,</b> and tobacco-related psychosocial risk factors. Results Approximately 2 % of adolescents with cancer and 22 % of adolescents without cancer reported current smoking. Compared to nonsmoking adolescents without cancer, nonsmoking adolescents with cancer were one third {{less likely to report}} intentions <b>to</b> <b>smoke.</b> No significant interactions were detected between group (having cancer or not) and each of the tobacco-spe-cific and psychosocial variables tested in two separate multivariable models. Intentions <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> were best predicted by variables most proximal to smoking. Adolescents who smoked in the past and who had lower tobacco knowledge and greater perceived instrumental value {{were more likely to report}} intentions <b>to</b> <b>smoke.</b> Adolescents who were less optimistic were also more likely <b>to</b> intend <b>to</b> <b>smoke.</b> Conclusions Tobacco-related risk factors for intentions <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> appeared <b>to</b> be similar among adolescents with and without cancer. Implications of these findings for tobacco control among adolescents with cancer are discussed. Key words smoking; tobacco use; pediatric cancer.

40|$|There is now strong {{evidence}} that exercise has an acute effect on the urge <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> and the accompanying withdrawal symptoms. However, the perceptions by heavy smokers of exercise {{and its relationship to}} the urge <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> have not been well documented. The aim of the present study is to understand the experiences of heavy smokers with regard to exercise and its effect on their urge <b>to</b> <b>smoke.</b> Five physically inactive, heavy smokers are asked to abstain from smoking the night before exercising on a cycle ergometer under two conditions (one at medium and one at vigorous intensity done a week apart). Semi-structured, in-depth interviews are conducted after the second exercise session. Thematic analysis reveals six themes describing the participants’ experience of exercise, urge <b>to</b> <b>smoke,</b> exercise preferences, exercise and smoking relationship, exercise as an aid to quit smoking, and the effects of the experimental procedure. Overall, the participants’ experiences support the existing literature, which has posited affective, biological, and cognitive mechanisms contributing to a delay in the urge <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> after exercise. The main findings pertain to: (1) the “feel-good” effect after exercise as a relief from the “feel-bad” effect during exercise; (2) the decreased urge <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> after exercise, stated by all participants regardless of reported positive and negative feelings; and (3) exercise as a “clearing the mind” mechanism rather than an attention-distracting mechanism...|$|R
