5|$|Oleg's {{death has}} been <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{distorted}} {{variant of the}} threefold death theme in Indo-European myth and legend, with prophecy, the snake and the horse representing the three functions: the prophecy is associated with sovereignty, the horse with warriors, and the serpent with reproduction.|$|E

50|$|The {{descriptive}} {{approach can}} be <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> effort to maximize the economic resources available to future generations, allowing them {{to decide how to}} use those resources (Arrow et al., 1996b:133-134). The prescriptive {{approach can be}} <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> effort to do as much as is economically justified {{to reduce the risk of}} climate change.|$|R
5|$|The Periya Puranam {{version is}} <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Brahmanical narrative, where a {{particular}} Dalit is granted salvation by transforming into a Brahmin; {{the superiority of}} the Brahmins is reinforced and the legitimacy of the ban of Dalits is not challenged.|$|E
5|$|The eastern face {{is usually}} <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{depiction}} of Christ flanked by angels above the four evangelists, although Robert Maule, {{in the earliest}} description of the stone, described the scene as Moses giving out the Law.|$|E
5|$|While NVC is ostensibly {{taught as}} a process of {{communication}} designed to improve compassionate connection to others, it has also been <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> spiritual practice, a set of values, a parenting technique, an educational method and a worldview.|$|E

5|$|Another {{formation}} with tyrannosaur {{remains is}} the Lance Formation of Wyoming. This has been <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bayou environment similar to today's Gulf Coast. The fauna {{was very similar}} to Hell Creek, but with Struthiomimus replacing its relative Ornithomimus. The small ceratopsian Leptoceratops also lived in the area.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{opposed the}} {{creation}} of the Society because he viewed it, with its hereditary membership, as a noble order unwelcome in the newly independent Republic, contrary to the ideals of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, for whom the Society was named; his reference to the two kinds of birds is <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> satirical comparison between the Society of the Cincinnati and Cincinnatus.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 DCIEM (Defence and Civil Institution of Environmental Medicine, Canada) {{released}} No-Decompression and Decompression Tables {{based on}} the Kidd/Stubbs serial compartment model and extensive ultrasonic testing, and Edward D. Thalmann published the USN E-L algorithm and tables for constant PO2 Nitrox closed circuit rebreather applications, and extended use of the E-L model for constant PO2 Heliox CCR in 1985.

5|$|Items 77–81 in {{the code}} have been <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{description}} of a woman's financial rights after a divorce or legal separation. These clauses define {{how much of the}} household goods a woman could keep in different circumstances, depending on whether she keeps custody of the children, for example. It has recently been suggested, however, that it would be more correct to interpret these clauses as referring to women who are widowed, rather than divorced.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about sivaladapid ecology. Gingerich and Sahni {{suggested}} that Indraloris was probably arboreal and {{that it may have}} been more frugivorous (eating fruit) than Sivaladapis, which they <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> folivore (leaf-eater). Flynn and Morgan interpreted I.kamlialensis as a mixed feeder. The Late Miocene extinction of Indian sivaladapids may be related to a decline in forest cover in Asia and to competition by immigrating colobine monkeys.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{historically}} contentious views within Jainism {{is in part}} attributed to Mahavira and his ascetic life where he never wore any clothes as a mark of disowning everything (<b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> consequence of the fifth vow of Aparigraha). The disputes triggered by this teaching of Mahavira are those related to gender and whether a female mendicant (sadhvi) can achieve spiritual liberation just like a male mendicant (sadhu) through Jain ascetic practices.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the song the sun slowly rises and the lyrics can be <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{proclamation}} of the hope that as the sky clears after a difficult night, all the world's people will rise together to proclaim their survival {{to the sound of the}} church bells.|$|E
5|$|The Dinosaur Park Formation is <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> low-relief {{setting of}} rivers and {{floodplains}} that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions {{over time as}} the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{appearance}} of the icon is unclear: although the early image has been <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bust of the Christ Pantocrator type, late Byzantine references, such as coins by John III Vatatzes (r. 1221–1254) and the Deesis mosaic in the Chora Church, use the term for depictions of a standing Christ on a pedestal.|$|E
5|$|The myth of Myrrha {{has been}} {{interpreted}} in various ways. The transformation of Myrrha in Ovid's version has been <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> punishment for her breaking the social rules through her incestuous relationship with her father. Like Byblis who {{fell in love with}} her brother, Myrrha is transformed and rendered voiceless making her unable to break the taboo of incest.|$|E
5|$|The suffix is {{sometimes}} missing, {{which has been}} <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> zero suffix. Words with zero suffix are termed root verbs and root nouns.
