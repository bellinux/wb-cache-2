2500|$|The {{construction}} of the C 37/40 was ahead of it's time. Utilizing aircraft grade pre-impregnated balsa core material and Kevlar / fibreglass fabric, the hull and deck are laid up using vinyl <b>ester</b> <b>resin</b> for strength, blister resistance and light weight. The C 37 Plus series are built up with isophthalic (Hydrex®) gelcoat, C's exclusive Kevlar hybrid, E-Glass, pre-impregnated end-grain Baltek AL-600 balsa ( [...] balsa core in hull and [...] in deck) and Hydrex® resin. Hydrex®, a modified isophthalic [...] vinyl <b>ester</b> <b>resin,</b> has higher hydrolytic stability, toughness and is more crack resistant than conventional resins. The layups of the R and XL series use Kevlar hybrid exclusively with Hydrex® resin {{on both sides of}} a core of Balteck AL-600 aircraft grade balsa. All materials are Lloyd's approved. These exclusive C laminate schedules result in hulls and decks which despite significant weight reduction are stronger than the conventional glass laminates of the time. They are not only much lighter, but stiffer and more rigid. Additional unidirectional glass is used in highly stressed areas with aluminum and coremat hardware backing. The boot stripe is molded in the hull for fairness to the hull surface and to reduce maintenance requirements.|$|E

40|$|This work {{builds on}} our {{previous}} experience of blending and co-curing an unsaturated polyester resin with other relatively inexpensive, but more flame retardant resins such as chemically modified phenolic resins, and extends this {{technology to the}} almost equally flammable vinyl <b>ester</b> <b>resins,</b> commonly used in marine composites. It has been demonstrated that two commercial vinyl <b>ester</b> <b>resins</b> (Scott-Bader, UK), one epoxy based (Crystic VE 676) and the other novolac based (Crystic VE 673), may be blended with two different commercial low molecular weight phenolic resoles (Sumitomo Bakelite Europe NV), one unmodified (Durez 33156) and the other containing allyl groups (Methylon 75108) and the blends cured (crosslinked) to give blended resins with good flame retardance, in several respects better {{than that of the}} unblended vinyl <b>ester</b> <b>resins.</b> Compatibility of the vinyl esters with the Methylon resole is however better than with the Durez, which tends to give phase-separated blends, and thus blends having poor physical and mechanical properties.

This compatibility issue and derived flammability properties of different blends are discussed in terms of their chemical structures...|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{this process}} uses a low {{viscosity}} (100 to 1000 cP) polyester or vinyl <b>ester</b> <b>resin</b> along with fiberglass fibers {{to create a}} composite. Normally the process is capable of producing composites with a fiber volume fraction between 40-50%. The resin to fiber ratio is important for determining the overall strength and performance of the final part, with mechanical strength being most influenced {{by the type of}} fiber reinforcement. The type of resin used will primarily determine the corrosion resistance, heat distortion temperature, and surface finish. Resins used in this process must have low viscosities due to the limited pressure differential provided by the vacuum pump. High performance fibers, such as carbon fiber, can also be used. However, their usage is less common and is mainly for the fabrication of high end parts.|$|E

40|$|Free radical cured {{thermosetting}} {{vinyl ester}} resins have superior toughness and chemical resistance {{in comparison to}} unsaturated polyester. The use of vinyl ester composites reinforced with carbon fibers requires an improvement in the fiber-matrix adhesion levels. Previous data {{has shown that the}} application of a lightly cross-linked amine-cured epoxy sizing to the carbon fiber surface creates a beneficial interphase between the carbon fiber and vinyl <b>ester</b> <b>resin</b> matrix resulting in a substantial increase in fiber-matrix adhesion and the sizing has a optimum thickness [1, 2, 8]. However, the exact mechanism by which this coating improved adhesion is not known. Vinyl <b>ester</b> <b>resin</b> can undergo as much as 10 % volume shrinkage with cure while typical epoxy systems undergo only 3 - 4 % shrinkage during cure [4 - 6].

Bamboo strip as a kind of natural material has been used to reinforce vinyl <b>ester</b> <b>resin,</b> in this study. The moisture absorption behavior of the bamboo strips and their adhesion to vinyl <b>ester</b> <b>resin</b> at different levels of relative humidity (RH) during specimen fabrication are investigated. To improve moisture resistance and the adhesion to vinyl <b>ester</b> <b>resin</b> under high RH conditions, the bamboo strips are subject to different chemical treatments, that is with alkaline, pre-alkaline and acetic anhydride, pre-alkaline and potassium permanganate, and pre-alkaline and silane. The study of the equilibrium moisture content of modified bamboo strips shows that it is slightly increased by alkaline treatment, while it is reduced by the other three methods, especially by acetylation due to its well-known esterification. The interfacial shear strength (IFSS) by pull-out test is greatly improved after the modification and it decreases steadily as the fabrication RH levels increase for both untreated and treated samples. At high level RH (80 % RH), IFSS is almost negligible except acetylated specimens. Results indicate that the severe negative impact on the IFSS by fabrication RH levels is not so considerable if the bamboo strips are subjected to acetylation as pretreatment. The interlaminar shear strength values based on short-beam shear test of unidirection bamboo strip mats/vinyl <b>ester</b> <b>resin</b> composites are well consistent with IFSS data...|$|E
