40|$|State aid law {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} categories of the competition law in the European Union. The state as such has an unprecedented advantage compared to other competitors: the state disposes of a huge amount of funds which could be easily distributed in favor of the privileged undertakings. The risk of the distorting effect on competition is high; thus, strict rules are necessary. The thesis is divided into five parts: introduction, the part focusing on international treaties, the general part, specific provisions and the conclusion. Part two of this thesis deals with the respective international treaties relevant <b>for</b> the <b>aid</b> <b>schemes.</b> There are three groups of such international treaties: the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures adopted in the WTO system, the anti-aid measures in the European Economic Area and the anti- subsidies mechanism towards the third countries (i. e. non-members of EEA or WTO). This part describes these three mechanisms and their common principles. Part three of the thesis is dedicated to the general provision. Section 3. 1 deals with the term "state aid", describes the main criteria for qualification of the aid as a state aid incompatible with the internal market.

When the Bar Council of India decided to establish a new law school in early 1980s, Menon's services were sought and he is known to have set up the Bangalore-based National Law School of India University with a [...] 150,000 government grant. The school was the first in India to use the Harvard Law School's case study method, which later became the mainstream form of legal education in India.

40|$|Use of inter-loop <b>aiding</b> <b>for</b> {{improving}} tracking {{performance has}} been widely researched in recent years. However, most of the previously proposed <b>aiding</b> <b>schemes</b> rely {{on the assumption that}} the aiding loop remains unaffected by received interference. This paper argues that this may not always be the case. It is likely that the performance of the aiding loop may also degrade in the case where interference is received at the aiding carrier’s frequency resulting in performance degradation of both aiding and aided loops. This paper proposes an <b>aiding</b> <b>scheme</b> that offers performance improvements in case interference corrupts both frequencies. Also, an algorithm is proposed that continuously updates the aided loop bandwidth to keep its jitter at a minimum. A relationship between the quality of the aiding signal and its effects on the performance of the aided loop is analysed. An adaptive Kalman filter-based implementation of the aiding architecture is proposed to improve the quality of aiding estimates. This implementation offers an improved margin against received interference. Simulation and real data results are presented that show improvements of 7 and 5 dB-Hz in this margin by employing the proposed <b>aiding</b> <b>scheme</b> with and without an adaptive Kalman filter...|$|R
40|$|Both the European Commission’s {{decision-making}} and the EU case-law on state <b>aid</b> <b>schemes</b> are symptomatic of the uncertainty, {{and sometimes even}} contradiction, that is implicit in treatments of State aid, a discipline which form part of the Treaty’s rules on competition, in which, nonetheless the rights that undertakings enjoy are quite limited. This article examines the current position in the case-law on whether it is possible <b>for</b> undertakings (whether <b>aid</b> beneficiaries, or their competitors) to challenge the Commission’s decision on <b>aid</b> <b>schemes,</b> meaning state measures, often implemented {{in the form of}} legislation, that address a number of beneficiaries and that may fall under the prohibition set forth in Articles 107 et seq. TFEU. This is an area in which the Commission and the Community judicature are constantly doing battle. The Commission tends to view its decisions as purely general measures, and as such not open to challenge, the judicature has shown greater flexibility towards the undertakings that bring actions before it, frequently finding that these decisions affect applicants’ positions, and are thus subject to review. The article looks in particular at recent developments in the case-law that have applied Article 263 (4) TFEU, final limb, to State aid, finding that a decision on an <b>aid</b> <b>scheme</b> may in some cases constitute a regulatory act not entailing implementing measures. The aim is to show how in this field the case-law of the European courts, while complex and not always consistent, has nonetheless sought to listen to businesses’ concerns, gradually eroding the principle favoured by the Commission, that decisions on <b>aid</b> <b>schemes</b> are an exclusive matter between the Commission and the Member States...|$|R
