This book tries to answer this difficult question through a comprehensive coverage of economic and industrial reforms in the Baltic countries. Though small in size and population, the three have recovered their strategic position on the interface between Russia and Western Europe. As candidates for EU- and NATO-membership, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have become new neighbors {{in more than one}} sense, not only for Central Europe, but for Western Europe as well. Just like in the rest of Central and Eastern Europe, {{there was no way to}} avoid the radical break between Soviet socialism and post-socialism, i. e. the emergence of a capitalist market economy. In macroeconomic terms, the Baltic countries have moved from depression to rapid growth within five years. The real difficulties consisted - and still consist - in structural reforms, on the enterprise level, on the level of newly emerging networks, and on the institutional surrounding: the science&technology system, competition policy, banking and financial institutions. This book presents the result of an expert study financed by the European Commission, and conducted jointly by Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian, British and French institutions. Based upon on-site research, it covers macro- and industrial reforms as well as case studies of selected branches and enterprises. The reader gets a comprehensive overview of the unique first post-socialist years of the Baltic economies, and the conditions of development of our new neighbors.

40|$|We {{test the}} {{relationship}} between exclusive agreements and technology transfer among firms in the automotive supply industry in EU candidate countries. Exclusive agreements come in bundles, are reciprocal and are passed on up- or downstream. The type of exclusivity employed by a firm depends on {{its position in the}} supply chain. Downstream firms {{are more likely to be}} subject to and/or impose vertical restraints. Technology trickles upstream: Multinational final assemblers transfer a lot of technology; lower-tier suppliers less. Technology transfer is negatively related to the exclusive agreements that should protect it, suggesting a certain incidence of anti- rather than pro-competitive motives. Complementary case studies reveal three possible motives for vertical restraints. Owners of technology protect their intellectual property; recipients of technology protect investments in relation-specific assets; and either or both engage in attempts to increase market power. This has implications for competition policy in an enlarging Europe.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Despite its significance <b>for</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>economics,</b> utility regulation and competition policy, the measurement of the economic profitability of a firm remains a relatively underresearched area. The difference between the Accounting Rate of Return (ARR), measured on a net replacement cost or current cost basis, and a firm's estimated risk adjusted cost of capital is favoured by many economic researchers and is widely employed in utility regulation, but strong claims have been made for Tobin's q (q - {{the ratio of the}} market value of a firm's securities to the cost of replicating the firm, often identified with the net replacement cost of its net assets). Both measures have shortcomings. Davis and Kay have drawn attention to, but have failed to fully explain, a bias in ARR when firms buy in goods and services. Bias in q due to the omission of hidden capital can be significant. In this paper, economic profitability is identified with a firm's input-output ratio expressed in present value terms, and with the internal rate of return on a firm's expenditure in the accounting year, both revenue and capital. In the case of ex Post profitability, the last two measures are shown to be equivalent. Departures from the form of these ideal measures explains the biases in both ARR and q. Employing the Capital Asset Pricing Model, two alternative, operational measures of a firm's economic profitability are derived from the ideal measures with a view to eliminating the biases in q and ARR. The ex post measure is called here the Return on Total Capital Employed (ROTCE) and the ex ante measure is called here modified Tobin's q (modq). ROTCE is appraised using data from a simple corporate model. modq is appraised using data extracted from the accounts of companies comprising the Buildings Materials and Food Manufacturing sectors of the FTA All Share Index. In this study, I/modq and 1 /q are shown to be significantly correlated at the 95 t confidence level, and some 45 k of the difference between them can be associated with taxation effects. Associating market power with the product of Beta and the Return on Sales, 1 /modq is found to be significantly related at the 95 t confidence level with market power and wages deflated by market value...|$|E

That is, a particular merger may materialize despite the existence of an alternative merger capable of generating larger synergies and hence higher profits and higher social surplus.

40|$|This paper unifies two {{significant}} but somewhat contradictory ideas. First, search costs potentially influence market price equilibria significantly; in many equilibria consumers do not search despite above-competitive prices. Second, cartels must guard against individual members offering lower prices, thereby creating incentives {{for consumers to}} search. We develop a simple framework, and then an example, in which whether search takes place depends upon the magnitude of search costs. Three potential equilibria result, dependent upon model parameters. These include a tacit cartel agreement exhibiting price variance and volatility. A policy conclusion is that such market characteristics do not always guarantee non-cartelisation. * We {{would like to thank}} participants in the Warwick Industrial Organisation Workshop, and the August 2006 meeting of the European Association <b>for</b> Research in <b>Industrial</b> <b>Economics</b> at Amsterdam, <b>for</b> helpful comments and suggestions.

40|$|The {{pilot project}} Lund Calling {{is a step}} for {{initiating}} {{the process of learning}} about sustainability issues in global–local settings through the implementation of the Young Masters Programme (YMP). Lund Calling was originally started by the Municipality of Lund to promote education for sustainable development (ESD), giving pupils from grade 8 up to the completion of upper secondary level the opportunity to study the YMP within the framework of their regular studies. This was to be accomplished by the construction of a local course, considered to be “a raw model” for all schools in Lund. A number of schools were specifically selected by the Department of Education in the Municipality of Lund to participate in the pilot project Lund Calling. Alongside with the educational pilot project, a research project was also to be conducted. The aim of the research project was to analyse and describe pupils’ and teachers’ experiences of the pilot project. Later, interviews with headmasters were also included. The purpose of this empirical investigation is, in other words, not to evaluate or assess the effectiveness of the initial attempts to implement the YMP at schools in the Municipality of Lund, but rather to contribute to the further development of the implementation processes, by capturing some of the experiences, voices and engagement of the many stakeholders and participants. Preliminary findings were presented during a seminar (2008) at the International Institute <b>for</b> <b>Industrial</b> Environmental <b>Economics</b> (IIIEE) at Lund University, which was addressed to participants from schools in Lund. Findings were also presented at the international conference initiated by the Regional Centre of Expertise on education for sustainable development in Skåne (RCE-Skåne) : EU as Global Actor – The pilot project Lund Calling 2009.
