5|$|Activation of AMPK was {{required}} for metformin's inhibitory effect on liver glucose production. AMPK is an enzyme that {{plays an important role}} in insulin signaling, whole body energy balance and the metabolism of glucose and fats. AMPK Activation {{was required}} for an increase in the expression of small heterodimer partner, which in turn inhibited the expression of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase. Metformin is frequently used in research along with AICA ribonucleotide as an AMPK agonist. Mouse models in which the genes for AMPKα1 and α2 catalytic subunits (Prkaa1/2) or LKB1, an upstream kinase of AMPK, had been knocked out in hepatocytes, have raised doubts over the role of AMPK, since the effect of metformin was not abolished by loss of AMPK function. The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain; however, metformin increases the concentration of cytosolic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (as opposed to a change in total AMP or total AMP/adenosine triphosphate). Increased cellular AMP has been proposed to explain the inhibition of glucagon-induced increase in cAMP and activation of PKA. Metformin and other biguanides may antagonize the action of glucagon, thus reducing <b>fasting</b> <b>glucose</b> levels. Metformin also induces a profound shift in the faecal microbial community profile in diabetic mice and this may contribute to its mode of action possibly through an effect on glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{perinatal}} outcomes of gestational diabetic patients with normal <b>fasting</b> plasma <b>glucose</b> level < 5. 3 mmol/L, versus impaired <b>fasting</b> plasma <b>glucose</b> level ≥ 5. 3 mmol/L on 100 g oral glucose tolerance results. All gestational diabetic patients enrolled in the study were diagnosed by standard 100 g oral glucose blood samples. Based on oral glucose tolerance results, patients were divided into two groups according to the fasting plasma glucose; Group 1 normal <b>fasting</b> plasma <b>glucose</b> < 5. 3 mmol/L, and Group 2 impaired <b>fasting</b> plasma <b>glucose</b> ≥ 5. 3 mmol/L. During the study period, a total of 292 patients were identified as having gestational diabetes mellitus. One hundred eighty-two (62. 3 %) were with normal <b>fasting</b> plasma <b>glucose</b> < 5. 3 mmol/L and 110 (37. 7 %) patients had impaired <b>fasting</b> plasma <b>glucose</b> ≥ 5. 3 mmol/L. The percentage of total and primary cesarean delivery and the arithmetic means ±SD of all fasting and postprandial plasma glucose measurements were significantly lower in-Group 1 compared with Group 2 patients. Patients with impaired <b>fasting</b> plasma <b>glucose</b> needed more insulin therapy and were associated with a higher rate of cesarean delivery compared to patients with normal <b>fasting</b> plasma <b>glucose</b> who may need ordinary follow-up rather than frequent surveillance...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of nutrient intake, genetic factors and common household environmental factors on the aggregation of <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> among Mexican-Americans in Starr County, Texas. This study was designed to determine: (a) the proportion of variation of <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> concentration explained by unmeasured genetic and common household environmental effects; (b) the degree of familial aggregation of measures of nutrient intake; and (c) the extent to which the familial aggregation of <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> is explained by nutrient intake and its aggregation. The method of path analysis was employed to determine these various effects. ^ Genes play an important role in fasting blood glucose: Genetic variation was found to explain about 40 % of the total variation in <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose.</b> Common household environmental effects, on the other hand, explained less than 3 % of the variation in <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> levels among individuals. Common household effects, however, did have significant effects on measures of nutrient intake, though it explained only about 10 % of the total variance in nutrient intake. Finally, there was significant familial aggregation of nutrient intake measures, but their aggregation did not contribute significantly to the familial aggregation of <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose.</b> These results imply that similarities among relatives for <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> are not due to similarities in nutrient intake among relatives. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} {{the association between}} longitudinal changes in <b>fasting</b> serum <b>glucose</b> and changes in flourodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG PET) measurements of regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (rCMRgl) in brain regions preferentially affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). A secondary objective was to investigate whether higher <b>fasting</b> serum <b>glucose</b> levels are associated with lower rCMRgl in younger adults within these same AD relevant brain areas. Methods: For the primary study, baseline, interim, and 4. 4 ± 1. 0 -year follow-up <b>fasting</b> serum <b>glucose</b> and PET CMRgl were analyzed in 80 cognitively unimpaired, non-diabetic, 61. 5 ± 5 year-old persons with a first-degree family history of AD, including 38 carriers and 42 non-carriers of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε 4 allele. An automated brain-mapping algorithm was used to characterize associations between changes in <b>fasting</b> serum <b>glucose</b> levels and changes in rCMRgl. Longitudinal changes in <b>fasting</b> serum <b>glucose</b> levels and their correlation with changes in six pre-selected neuropsychological test measures of memory, attention and processing speed were also assessed with linear regression. The secondary study included a cross sectional sample of 31 cognitively unimpaired, non-diabetic participants, 31. 2 ± 5. 4 years of age. General linear model-based voxel-wise analyses were performed to examine the correlation between <b>fasting</b> serum <b>glucose</b> and rCMRgl. Results: In the primary study of older adults, average <b>fasting</b> serum <b>glucose</b> levels increased over longitudinal measurement, and changes in these levels were inversely associated with longitudinal CMRgl changes {{in the vicinity of}} brain regions preferentially affected by AD (p< 0. 05, corrected for multiple comparisons). <b>Fasting</b> serum <b>glucose</b> was also inversely associated with performance on a measure of visuospatial memory (p< 0. 05, corrected for multiple comparisons). In the younger sample, <b>fasting</b> serum <b>glucose</b> levels were inversely associated with rCMRgl in left frontal pole and right primary visual cortex regions (p<. 05, corrected for multiple comparisons). Conclusions: In older adults, <b>fasting</b> serum <b>glucose</b> increases across time and is inversely related to rCMRgl in AD relevant regions and to visual memory test scores.

We investigated whether normal <b>fasting</b> plasma <b>glucose</b> levels (< 5. 60 mmol/l) are associated with decreases in insulin sensitivity and beta cell function, as well as an adverse cardiovascular profile in obese youth. We performed a cross-sectional analysis in a multiethnic sample of 1, 020 obese youth (614 girls and 406 boys; mean age 12. 9 years [CI 95 % 12. 7 - 13. 1], BMI z score 2. 34 [CI 95 % 2. 31 - 2. 38]) with normal <b>fasting</b> plasma <b>glucose.</b> All participants had a standard OGTT, with calculation of indices of insulin sensitivity and beta cell function.

40|$|A {{structured}} {{approach to}} the management of Type 2 diabetes, aiming to reduce <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> levels to near-normal, can provide effective blood glucose control with minimal risk of hypoglycaemia and in a manner acceptable to most patients. When the <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> value is maintained in the region 4 - 6 mmol l- 1, protein glycosylation and plasma triglyceride values usually become near-normal and this may help to prevent the development of long-term diabetic complications. We propose a simple management strategy, based on 3 -monthly <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> determination, which uses not more than two therapeutic agents at any one time. If diet and maximal oral therapy fail to keep <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> levels below 6 mmol l- 1 then {{the addition of a}} basal insulin supplement, e. g. from a once daily injection of ultralente insulin, can restore near-normal <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> levels without the need for full insulin replacement therapy.
