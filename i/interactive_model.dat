Those revised models can also serve as to test {{the viability of the}} original theories by comparing the empirical results with data generated from the model. [...] In addition, the computational models can also help to generate new testable hypothesis and allow researchers to manipulate conditions which might not be possible in normal experimentation. For example, researchers can investigate and simulate the lexical access systems under various states of damage without using aphasic people.|$|E
2500|$|Interactive {{accounts}} {{assume that}} all available information is processed {{at the same time}} and can immediately influence the computation of the final analysis. In the <b>interactive</b> <b>model</b> of sentence processing, there is no separate module for parsing. [...] Lexical access, syntactic structure assignment, and meaning assignment happen at the same time in parallel. Several syntactic hypotheses can be considered at a time. [...] The <b>interactive</b> <b>model</b> demonstrates an on-line interaction between the structural and lexical and phonetic levels of sentence processing. Each word, as it is heard in the context of normal discourse, is immediately entered into the processing system at all levels of description, and is simultaneously analyzed at all these levels in the light of whatever information is available at each level at that point in the processing of the sentence. [...] Interactive models of language processing assume that information flows both bottom-up and top-down, so that the representations formed at each level may be influenced by higher as well as lower levels. A framework called the interactive activation framework that embeds this key assumption among others, including the assumption that influences from different sources are combined nonlinearly. The nonlinearity means that information that may be decisive under some circumstances may have little or no effect under other conditions. In the interactive activation framework, the knowledge that guides processing is stored in the connections between units on the same and adjacent levels. The processing units that they connect may receive input from a number of different sources, which allows the knowledge that guides processing to be completely local while, at the same time, allowing the results of processing at one level to influence processing at other levels, both above and below. A basic assumption of the framework is that processing interactions are always reciprocal; it is this bi-directional characteristic that makes the system interactive. Bi-directional excitatory interactions between levels allow mutual simultaneous constraint among adjacent levels, and bi-diectional inhibitory interactions within a level allow for competition among mutually incompatible interpretations of a portion of an input. The between-level excitatory interactions are captured in the models in two-way excitatory connections between mutually compatible processing units. Syntactic ambiguities are in fact based at the lexical level. In addition, more recent studies with more sensitive eyetracking machines have shown early context effects. Frequency and contextual information will modulate the activation of alternatives even when they are resolved in favor of the simple interpretation. Structural simplicity is cofounded with frequency, which goes against the garden path theory ...|$|E

40|$|Many {{important}} {{computer graphics}} applications rely on 3 D models of real-world scenes. The current approach for modeling such scenes is first to acquire depth and color data {{and then to}} build a model off line. The approach is slow, the acquisition devices are expensive, and the resulting models are incomplete and of uneven quality. We propose an <b>interactive</b> <b>modeling</b> strategy where an operator scans the scene with a handheld device and the model is built incrementally.

The advantages of the <b>interactive</b> <b>modeling</b> approach are short modeling times, good scene coverage, even sampling, and low cost. Implementing the <b>interactive</b> <b>modeling</b> pipeline poses the following challenges: devising an acquisition device that is lightweight, compact and robust, real-time depth extraction, real-time registration, and real-time incremental modeling.

40|$|The {{effects of}} context on perceptual {{identification}} responses given without tinle pressure are well-described by classical models in which contextual and stimulus information exert independent effects. A recent Ilrticle by Massaro (1989) {{raises the possibility}} that <b>interactive</b> <b>models,</b> such as the TRACE model of speech perception, are inherently incompatible with these classical context effects. The present article shows that this incompatibility hypothesis can be rejected. Mathematical analysis and computer simulation methods are used to show that <b>interactive</b> <b>models</b> can exhibit the classical effects of context, if there is variability in the input to the network or if there is intrinsic variability in the network itself. A variety of <b>interactive</b> <b>models</b> which incorporate variability can aU produce the classical context effects, at least under some conditions; the conditions are rather general in the case of one of the variants.

30|$|The <b>interactive</b> <b>models</b> in {{the third}} {{generation}} build on the main disadvantage of previous models, namely the extremely simplified picture of the generally complex interactions between science, technology and market. These models were understood to giving a deeper understanding and a more thorough description of all the aspects and actors of the innovation process and providing {{a new look at}} innovation as a process subdivided into separate stages, each of them interacting with the others. In essence, the <b>interactive</b> <b>models</b> stressed that innovation is no longer the end product of a final stage of activities but can occur at various places throughout the process and the innovation process can also be circular (iterative) rather than purely sequential (Rothwell and Zegveld 1985; Beije 1998; Kline and Rosenberg 1986). The <b>interactive</b> <b>models</b> eventually brought together the technology push and market pull approaches into a comprehensive model of innovation and developed a more complete and nuanced approach to the issue of the factors and players involved in innovation. However, the <b>interactive</b> <b>models</b> still did not specify the driving forces for the innovation engine, why some companies are better at doing in innovation than others, strategies of learning for organizations {{and the role of the}} company’s environment for the success of innovation.|$|R
