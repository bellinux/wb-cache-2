25|$|Parental {{education}} about Panayiotopoulos syndrome <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone</b> of correct management. The traumatizing, sometimes long-lasting effect on parents is significant particularly because autonomic seizures may last for many hours compounded by physicians’ uncertainty regarding diagnosis, management, and prognosis.|$|E
25|$|Marriage <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone</b> {{on which}} our society was founded. For {{those who say}} that the Constitution is so sacred that we cannot or should not adopt the Federal Marriage Amendment, I would simply point out that marriage, and the {{sanctity}} of that institution, predates the American Constitution and the founding of our nation.|$|E

25|$|Religion is {{the opium}} of the people: this saying of Marx <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone</b> {{of the entire}} {{ideology}} of Marxism about religion.

25|$|Spermatogenesis {{produces}} mature male gametes, {{commonly called}} sperm but more specifically known as spermatozoa, which {{are able to}} fertilize the counterpart female gamete, the oocyte, during conception to produce a single-celled individual known as a zygote. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone</b> of sexual reproduction and involves the two gametes both contributing half the normal set of chromosomes (haploid) {{to result in a}} chromosomally normal (diploid) zygote.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary physics {{has settled}} on the Planck scale as the most {{suitable}} scale for a unified theory. The Planck scale was, however, anticipated by George Stoney. Like Planck after him, Stoney realised that large-scale effects such as gravity and small-scale effects such as electromagnetism naturally imply an intermediate scale where physical differences might be rationalised. This intermediate scale comprises units (Stoney scale units) of mass, length, time etc., yet mass <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{secondary}} title for this work, Uttaratantraśāstra, highlights the text's {{claim that the}} tathāgatagarbha or buddha-nature teachings represent the final, definitive teachings of the Buddha, {{in contrast to the}} earlier teachings on emphasizing intrinsic emptiness, such as contained in the Prajñāpāramitā sutras and other Mahayana sutras. In addition to the group of scriptures known as the Tathāgatagarbha sutras, this work <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone</b> of the tathāgatagarbha trend of thought in Mahayana Buddhism.|$|E
25|$|Today, Colonial Williamsburg is Virginia's largest tourist {{attraction}} (based upon attendance) and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone</b> of the Historic Triangle with Jamestown and Yorktown {{joined by the}} Colonial Parkway. In the 21st century, Williamsburg has continued to update and refine its attractions. There are more features designed to attract modern children and to offer better and additional interpretation of the African-American experience in the town. A century after Dr. Goodwin's work began, this masterpiece of Virginia and United States history remains a remarkable work-in-progress.|$|E
25|$|Southern Native American culture (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Seminole) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone</b> of {{southern}} cuisine. From their cultures came {{one of the}} main staples of the Southern diet: corn (maize) – either ground into meal or limed with an alkaline salt to make hominy, in a Native American process known as nixtamalization. Corn was used to make all kinds of dishes, from the familiar cornbread and grits, to liquors such as moonshine and whiskey (which is still important to the Southern economy).|$|E

25|$|There {{are more}} theatres and {{performance}} venues in Melbourne {{than any other}} city in Australia. In Southbank, Victoria, the Arts Centre Melbourne is a hub of performing arts venues and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone</b> of the Melbourne Arts Precinct which also includes the Melbourne Recital Centre and Southbank Theatre, home of the Melbourne Theatre Company. In the city's East End Theatre District, notable theatres include the Princess Theatre, Regent Theatre, Forum Theatre, Comedy Theatre; the Athenaeum, and Her Majesty's Theatre. The Palais Theatre is a significant music venue in nearby St Kilda.|$|E
25|$|Epidemiology is {{the study}} and {{analysis}} of the patterns, causes, and effects of health and disease conditions in defined populations. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone</b> of public health, and shapes policy decisions and evidence-based practice by identifying risk factors for disease and targets for preventive healthcare. Epidemiologists help with study design, collection, and statistical analysis of data, amend interpretation and dissemination of results (including peer review and occasional systematic review). Epidemiology has helped develop methodology used in clinical research, public health studies, and, to a lesser extent, basic research in the biological sciences.|$|E
25|$|Fibre Channel (FC) is a {{successor}} to parallel SCSI interface on enterprise market. It is a serial protocol. In disk drives usually the Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL) connection topology is used. FC has much broader usage than mere disk interfaces, and it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone</b> of storage area networks (SANs). Recently other protocols for this field, like iSCSI and ATA over Ethernet have been developed as well. Confusingly, drives usually use copper twisted-pair cables for Fibre Channel, not fibre optics. The latter are traditionally reserved for larger devices, such as servers or disk array controllers.|$|E

25|$|Cisplatin {{combination}} chemotherapy <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone</b> {{of treatment}} of many cancers. Initial platinum responsiveness is high {{but the majority}} of cancer patients will eventually relapse with cisplatin-resistant disease. Many mechanisms of cisplatin resistance have been proposed including changes in cellular uptake and efflux of the drug, increased detoxification of the drug, inhibition of apoptosis and increased DNA repair. Oxaliplatin is active in highly cisplatin-resistant cancer cells in the laboratory; however, there is little evidence for its activity in the clinical treatment of patients with cisplatin-resistant cancer. The drug paclitaxel may be useful in the treatment of cisplatin-resistant cancer; the mechanism for this activity is unknown.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the social}} mores {{represented}} in the show, a happy marriage <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone</b> of successful middle-class family life, and June and Ward represent the warm, happily married, successful middle class couple. In contrast, the parents of Beaver's friend Larry Mondello are a husband frequently {{out of town on}} business and an exasperated wife struggling single-handedly to raise a son and sometimes depending on Ward to help discipline him. Singles like prim Aunt Martha and globe-trotting, yarn-spinning Uncle Billy are shown as either out-of-touch and irksome or untrustworthy. The one episode dealing with divorce shows it as having negative effects on children and family life.|$|E
25|$|In Engel v. Vitale (1962) the Court {{ruled that}} government-imposed nondenominational prayer {{in public school}} was unconstitutional. In Lee v. Weisman (1992), the Court ruled prayer {{established}} by a school principal at a middle school graduation was also unconstitutional, and in Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe (2000) it ruled that school officials may not directly impose student-led prayer during high school football games nor establish an official student election process {{for the purpose of}} indirectly establishing such prayer. The distinction between force of government and individual liberty <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone</b> of such cases. Each case restricts acts by government designed to establish prayer while explicitly or implicitly affirming students' individual freedom to pray.|$|E
50|$|A {{comprehensive}} and meticulous history (i.e. illness of family members, {{recent visit to}} the tropics, medication), repeated physical examination (i.e. skin rash, eschar, lymphadenopathy, heart murmur) and myriad laboratory tests (serological, blood culture, immunological) <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone</b> of finding <b>the</b> cause.|$|R
