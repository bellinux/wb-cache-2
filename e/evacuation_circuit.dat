40|$|Expedited {{evacuation}} {{of commercial and}} residential structures {{in the event of}} an emergency may be more difficult for persons with physical movement disorders. There is a need to better characterize the impact of such disorders and provide movement data to improve evacuee and responder safety. We undertook a pilot, feasibility study that investigated the ability of persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) and controls without MS to walk along a 48 m long path that included five different door configurations with various opening hardware and closure mechanisms, both before and after a six-minute walk, simulating a long evacuation path. Persons with MS took longer to complete the <b>evacuation</b> <b>circuit</b> (102 vs. 31 s) and to pass through each door (average 4. 8 vs. 1. 4 s) compared to controls. During the six-minute walk, persons with MS had decreased walking speed (0. 7 vs. 1. 9 m/s). The MS population demonstrated more conservative gait biomechanics throughout the simulation, i. e., wider, shorter and slower steps. Timing and biomechanical differences between populations and the potential fatigue induced through an extended evacuation can be used to improve understanding of movement in populations with disabilities, and incorporate these data into estimation of flow rates during evacuation...|$|E

[...] Gao, fearful of Huang after Zhang's death, was unwilling to engage Huang, and in fact sent the imperial government urgent calls for help as Huang advanced north, across the Yangtze River, approaching his headquarters at Yang Prefecture (揚州). [...] When Emperor Xizong rebuked Gao for having previously sent back reinforcements that other circuits had sent, Gao sent an irreverent response that satirized Emperor Xizong, and refused to follow further imperial orders to engage Huang.
