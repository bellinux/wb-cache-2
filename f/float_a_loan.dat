50|$|Planning for a Shire Hall in the Gardiner Road District {{commenced}} {{as early}} as 1867. In 1878 land {{at the corner of}} High Street and Glenferrie Road was reserved for a Shire Hall, Court House and Library. Two years later, the estimated cost of erecting a building comprising a Shire Hall, Municipal, Post and Telegraph Offices, Library and Reading Room was £4,000. The Council considered the Shire could not afford to pay such a sum, and the members were against borrowing the money. In August, 1884, the proposal was again considered, and in November, the Council decided to <b>float</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> of £5,000 for the purpose of building a Shire Hall.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until the}} mid-50s, postwar {{construction}} had been financed on tax surpluses accumulated during World War II and the Korean War. After those surpluses ran out, further construction was financed on state bond issues. However, the state {{at that time}} would not finance student housing, and UCLA comprised 17,000 students with only Hershey Hall (originally constructed in 1930 as a 129-bed women's dorm) accommodating any students on campus. So the Regents <b>floated</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> {{from the federal government}} to build Dykstra Hall and Sproul Hall on the hill west of the athletic fields. They opened in 1959 and 1960, respectively. The UCLA Faculty Club assessed their membership $100 apiece and <b>floated</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> from the Regents to build the Faculty Center, which was completed in 1959. Ackerman Union was also built from <b>a</b> Regents <b>loan</b> paid for by fees self-assessed by students in this period.|$|R

The loan was raised through issuance of bonds to the public, an innovation. Demand greatly exceed the amount required. To meet payments on the war bonds, the 1855 budget had to increase the floating debt, and was passed with difficulty.A second war loan was authorized on 31 December 1854, and was again successful. The size of subscriptions was limited to encourage large numbers of small subscriptions by the supporters of the emperor.

50|$|When the First Dáil met in 1919, Éamon de Valera was the {{president}} of Sinn Féin and thus the natural choice for leadership. However he had been imprisoned in England so, at the second meeting of the Dáil on 22 January, Cathal Brugha was elected as the first Príomh Aire on a temporary basis. De Valera escaped Lincoln Gaol in February and so was elected to replace Brugha at the Dáil's third meeting on 1 April. As leader de Valera visited the United States from June 1919 to December 1920. His aim was to gain both popular and official recognition for the Republic, and to <b>float</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> to finance Dáil Éireann and the War of Independence. By his return de Valera had won public but not official support for the Republic and had raised a loan of $6 million.|$|E
50|$|Uruguay {{was in a}} {{state of}} turmoil and civil strife; there were {{repeated}} runs on the banks. Mauá Bank survived a brief run in January 1864. It <b>floated</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> for the government of Gen. Flores in December, and when it suffered another run in 1865, the government suspended specie payments for the two note-issuing banks and demanded forced loans. Banco Comercial demonstrated its soundness during the panic that followed. After the crisis, a new banking law was passed, which was the signal for a boom in bank creation. Suspension of convertibility ended in June.|$|R
5000|$|The use {{of checks}} in a scam {{hinges on the}} {{practice}} or law in many countries concerning checks: when an account holder presents a check for deposit, the bank will usually make the funds available to the account holder within 1-5 business days, although checks, particularly if international, may take longer than that to clear. The clearing process may take 7-10 days, and {{can take up to}} a month when dealing with foreign banks. The time between the funds appearing as available to the account holder and the check clearing is known as the [...] "float", during which time the bank could technically be said to have <b>floated</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> to the account holder to be covered with the funds from the bank clearing the check. Even after it has cleared, funds may be reclaimed much later if fraud is discovered.|$|R

50|$|De Valera {{went on to}} {{be named}} President of Dáil Éireann, and in May 1919 he visited the United States in this role. The mission had three objectives: to ask for {{official}} recognition of the Irish Republic, to <b>float</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> to finance {{the work of the}} Government (and by extension, the Irish Republican Army), and to secure the support of the American people for the republic. His visit lasted from June 1919 to December 1920 and had mixed success. One negative outcome was the splitting of the Irish-American organisations into pro- and anti-de Valera factions. De Valera managed to raise $5,500,000 from American supporters, an amount that far exceeded the hopes of the Dáil. Of this, $500,000 was devoted to the American presidential campaign in 1920 which helped him gain wider public support there. In 1921 it was said that $1,466,000 had already been spent, and it is unclear when the net balance arrived in Ireland. Recognition was not forthcoming in the international sphere. He also had difficulties with various Irish-American leaders, such as John Devoy and Judge Daniel F. Cohalan, who resented the dominant position he established, preferring to retain their control over Irish affairs in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the entire}} war {{the notion that}} the CSA possessed a most {{efficient}} engine of war in its monopoly of cotton (the [...] "King Cotton" [...] idea) buoyed up the hopes of the Confederates. The government in Richmond strained every effort to induce the great powers of Europe to recognize the Confederacy as a nation (see Cotton diplomacy). It also - more successfully - secured individual foreigners' financial recognition of the Confederate States by effecting a foreign loan based on cotton. This favorite notion went into practice in the spring of 1863. The French banking house of Erlanger & Company undertook to <b>float</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> of $3,000,000, redeemable after the war in cotton at the rate of sixpence a pound. According to one source, [...] Baron Rothschild informed W. W. Murphy, American consul-general in Frankfort, that [...] "all Germany condemned this act of lending money to establish a slaveholding government, and so great was public opinion against it that Erlanger and Company dare not offer it on the Frankfort bourse". As cotton at the time was selling at nearly four times that figure, and would presumably be quoted far above sixpence long after the establishment of peace, the bonds offered strong attractions to those speculatively inclined and in sympathy with the Confederate cause. The Confederate agents mismanaged the placing of the bonds in Europe, but notwithstanding, a considerable sum was secured from the public and used for the purchase of naval and military stores. This was aided in part by the (incorrect) assumption of some investors that, even should the Confederacy lose the war, the United States government would honor and redeem the bonds. However, {{at the close of the}} war the re-established Federal authorities ignored these foreign bonds, like all the other bonds of the Confederate government, or of state governments under the Confederacy.|$|E
2500|$|Boutwell {{had sought}} finance {{some of the}} debt {{reduction}} through the placement of loans in Europe. [...] This idea was complicated by Civil War claims against the United Kingdom (the so-called Alabama Claims emanating from British support for the CSS Alabama and other Confederate privateers), {{and then by the}} outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War shortly after the financing bill was passed. [...] The latter prevented placement of offers in mainland European financial centers, and the unresolved Alabama issues prevented their placement in London. [...] Political pressure {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic resulted in the 1871 Treaty of Washington, after which Boutwell <b>floated</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> in London. [...] The first loan offer unravelled, however, because Boutwell offered it to too many banks, but a second, reorganized attempt led by financier Jay Cooke succeeded in raising over $100 million. [...] It was the first time an American bank successfully engaged in this type of international transaction.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike France and Britain, at the {{outbreak}} of the First World War Germany found itself largely excluded from international financial markets. This became most apparent after <b>an</b> attempt to <b>float</b> <b>a</b> major <b>loan</b> on Wall Street failed in 1914. As such, Germany was largely limited to domestic borrowing, which was induced by a series of war credit bills passing the Reichstag. This took place in many forms; however, the most publicised was the public war bond (...) drives.|$|R

He succeeded in obtaining £100,000 towards the cost of a warship, the Cerberus, and the Nelson was given to Victoria as a training-ship. Verdon also <b>floated</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> for public works, and obtained sanction {{for the establishment of a}} branch of the Royal Mint at Melbourne. After his return he suggested the advisability of the colony having a representative in London, and in 1868 the office of agent-general was created, and Verdon was appointed to the position for a period of four years. He made a most favourable impression in London, he had been given the companionship of the bath in 1866, and in 1872 he was created K.C.M.G. He was also elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1870. On his giving up the agent-generalship he accepted the position of colonial inspector and general manager of the English Scottish and Australian Chartered Bank, Melbourne.|$|R
50|$|Morgan {{played a}} {{prominent}} part in financing World War I. Following its outbreak, {{he made the}} first loan of $12,000,000 to Russia. In 1915, <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> of $500,000,000 was made to France and Britain following negotiations by the Anglo-French Financial Commission. The firm's involvement with British and French interests fueled charges the bank was conspiring to maneuver the United States into supporting the Allies in order to rescue its loans. By 1915, when it became apparent the war {{was not going to}} end quickly, the company decided to forge formal relationships with France. Those dealings became strained {{over the course of the}} war as a result of poor personal relations with French emissaries, relationships that were heightened in importance by the unexpected duration of the conflict, its costs, and the complications flowing from American neutrality. Contributing to the tensions was the favoritism displayed by Morgan officials to British interests. His personal friendship with Cecil Spring Rice ensured that from 1915 until sometime after the United States entered the war, his firm was the official purchasing agent for the British government, buying cotton, steel, chemicals and food, receiving a 1% commission on all purchases. Morgan organized a syndicate of about 2200 banks and <b>floated</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> of $500,000,000 to the Allies. The British sold off their holdings of American securities and by late 1916 were dependent on unsecured loans for further purchases.|$|R
5000|$|In {{business}} and finance, <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> rate <b>loan</b> (or <b>a</b> variable or adjustable rate <b>loan)</b> refers to <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> with <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> interest rate.

50|$|The {{most common}} type of swap is an {{interest}} rate swap. Some companies may have comparative advantage in fixed rate markets, while other companies have a comparative advantage in floating rate markets. When companies want to borrow, they look for cheap borrowing, i.e. from the market where they have comparative advantage. However, this may lead to a company borrowing fixed when it wants floating or borrowing floating when it wants fixed. This is where a swap comes in. A swap has the effect of transforming <b>a</b> fixed rate <b>loan</b> into <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> rate <b>loan</b> or vice versa.|$|R

It is asserted that these ships, which are named the Sao Paulo, the Minas Geras sic and the Rio de Janeiro, and all of which will be completed by next fall, will be conveyed to the German government on the payment of $30,000,000.It may be recalled that when orders were placed for the ships ... there was much speculation as to the destiny of the vessels, as no naval expert could understand how a second-rate power like Brazil needed such formidable engines of war which would represent absolutely the latest stages of naval construction and armament. Meanwhile, it had been reported that the ships were being built for the Japanese government, which had a secret understanding with Brazil. But this theory was soon discarded by the fact that relations between these two countries were not extremely cordial on account of the attitude of Brazil toward the immigration of Japanese laborers. Then it was semi-officially stated that the ships would never leave the ways except to fly the British flag, but the money for such a purpose could only be raised by <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> or the Admiralty getting the sum from the sinking fund—contingencies which would naturally become public property long before they could be carried out.|$|R
50|$|One {{thing to}} {{consider}} when getting <b>a</b> term <b>loan</b> is whether the interest rate is fixed or <b>floating.</b> <b>A</b> fixed interest rate means {{that the percentage of}} interest will never increase, regardless of the financial market. Low-interest periods are usually an excellent time to take out <b>a</b> fixed rate <b>loan.</b> <b>Floating</b> interest rates will fluctuate with the market, which can be good or bad for you depending on what happens with the global and national economy. Since some term loans last for 10 years, betting that the rate will stay consistently low is a real risk.|$|R
30|$|Likewise, {{consumers}} use a confirmatory test strategy {{when they}} read or skim disclosure forms. They only look for information that confirms what they were told and fail to look for information that disconfirms it. For example, borrowers might fall prey to a predatory adjustable rate loan because the mortgage broker tells them that the interest rate will be at a given relatively low rate. Even if they are skeptical of the mortgage broker’s verbal representation, {{they will try to}} allay their concerns by looking for evidence in the disclosure documents that the interest rate will indeed be at the given low rate. They typically do not (and often cannot) think of the alternative that the given low rate is only an introductory rate and that it will change later. One of the authors (Prof. Stark) witnessed a law student go through such a cognitive process in her real estate transactions class. In her lecture, Prof. Stark had casually mentioned that the prevailing prime rate at that time was at least 5 %. At the end of the lecture, a student approached her and claimed that she was about to receive <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> at 4 %. The mortgage broker had told her that the rate was 4 %, and she had read the mortgage contract—probably skimmed—and saw the interest rate was indeed 4 %. She did not notice that the contract was for an adjustable rate mortgage. Housing Action Illinois (2007) reported that {{the overwhelming majority of the}} borrowers they spoke with that were presented with <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> rate <b>loan</b> were surprised to find out from the counseling agency that the loan they were about to enter was <b>an</b> adjustable rate <b>loan</b> which could lead to a doubling of the interest rate within a few years of entering into the loan.|$|R
