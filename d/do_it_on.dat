Hitler {{needed someone to}} keep up the pressure on Britain, and Göring was willing to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>On</b> 19 September, Hitler ordered that no further barges were to be added to Sea Lion ports, but those under assembly were to continue. But the damage being done by RAF Bomber Command now meant sustaining the army in readiness was becoming a strain. The invasion forces were broken up and moved East on the understanding it could be reassembled with only three weeks notice.|$|E
5|$|Several {{ownership}} schemes {{were considered}} {{in the process of}} building and running the system. One plan, which named city officials as the owners and operators of the network, was scrapped because the city lacked the core competency to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> its own, as well as the $25–30 million capital investment required for the initial construction. The plan which was ultimately adopted entailed a private company building and running the network. This plan met opposition from the Institute for Local Self Reliance, an organization that stated that it believed that the city should build the network itself, and then contract a private company to maintain it.|$|E
5|$|Sol and Naz {{spend the}} night {{together}} but at later dance rehearsals, Asher gives Naz her necklace back, and Sol sees this. He confronts Naz about it and she reveals she had a one-night stand with Asher but it meant nothing to her. Sol punches Asher, saying his brother has betrayed him, and a fight breaks out, but is broken up by Skolla and the other dancers. Skolla tells Sol and Asher they are both out {{of the group and}} reveals that Asher bought Sol's place. Sol goes back home to his mother but a neighbour tells him she has been taken away. Back in Walford, Naz insists she did not receive Sol's text message but he is still angry. Stevie attempts to get them to reconcile by locking them in the flat and pretending to swallow the key, but Naz reveals she is going to Turkey to meet Ekin's family and Sol says she can stay there. Sol and Naz get close again but Asher interrupts them when he returns drunk. Stevie drops the key revealing she did not swallow it and Sol thinks Naz was in on the plan so he tells her to enjoy Turkey before leaving. Asher finds Sol with their mother in hospital, and tells Sol he is better off with him than their mother as she is schizophrenic and has stabbed Asher. Sol says Asher is the problem and leaves. Asher finds him and apologises for Naz and says she did not get Sol's text message because he deleted it, and tells Sol that Naz loves him and he should do something about it. Sol returns to Walford again as Naz is leaving, and stops Ekin's car. Naz gets out and they kiss. Asher tells him he can dance at the dance-off, but when his name is called, he is unsure and calls for Asher, saying he needs him. Asher tells him he can <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his own. Everyone cheers him after his routine and he is called one of the best dancers.|$|E

25|$|The primary Scottish {{objective}} of ending the Union was now possible {{and they wanted}} to consolidate their position; although willing to assist an English rising or French invasion, they would not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> their own. For the Irish, only a Stuart on the British throne could provide the autonomous, Catholic Ireland promised them by James II. Charles argued only removing the Hanoverians could guarantee an independent Scotland and thousands of supporters would join once they entered England, while the Marquis d'Eguilles provided assurances a French landing was imminent.|$|E
25|$|When told by Nick Chance of Cafiero's {{decision}} not to go, booking agent Gerrard suggested drummer Cathy Green, who was based in Canberra. Gerrard knew Green was {{a huge fan of}} X, and thus knew the songs, and was a great drummer in her own right who could fill in to save the Melbourne tour. Luckily Cathy agreed to <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>on</b> a few days' notice. There were two hastily organised rehearsals prior to the Melbourne shows, {{which turned out to be}} a huge success. Cathy brought a new fresh yet solid feel to the band. Tragically, not long after that, Cafiero died when injected with a dye prior to an X-ray for a back complaint and Cathy became a permanent final member of X.|$|E
