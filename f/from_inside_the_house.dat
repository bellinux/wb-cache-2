5|$|When Sir William Sharington {{purchased}} {{the remains of}} the Augustinian nunnery in 1540, after the dissolution, he built a country house on the cloister court. He retained the cloisters and the medieval basement largely unaltered and built another storey above, so that the main rooms are on the first floor. The house is constructed of ashlar and rubble stone, the roofs are of stone slates and there are many twisted, sixteenth century chimney stacks. The house is a blend of different styles but lacks a cohesive plan; the four wings of the house are built above the cloister passages, but the house cannot be entered from the cloisters, and the cloisters cannot be seen <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> The abbey underwent substantial alterations in the Gothic Revival style in the 1750s, under the ownership of John Ivory Talbot. The great hall was redesigned during this period, the architect being Sanderson Miller.|$|E

50|$|At 5:40 pm on 11 June 1914, {{the chair}} was {{the object of a}} bomb attack thought to have been {{organised}} by the Suffragettes. A corner of {{the chair was}} broken off in the explosion. Although it was strong enough to shake the abbey walls and loud enough to be heard <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>Houses</b> of Parliament, none of the 70 people in the abbey at the time were injured, and the Coronation Chair was faithfully restored.|$|R
25|$|While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play {{clothes for}} the {{children}} and takes them around Salzburg and the surrounding mountains, and she teaches them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend, Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake that concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities, and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain orders her to return to the abbey. Just then he hears singing coming <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing {{for the first time in}} years. Afterwards, he apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay.|$|E
500|$|... "Take Me Home" [...] {{is another}} song {{in which the}} meaning was {{originally}} very vague. At first listening, {{it appears that the}} song is about going home, but this is not true. Collins has stated that the song lyrics refer to a patient in a mental institution, and that it is very much based on the novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Peter Gabriel, Helen Terry, and Sting all provide backing vocals. The music video (shot during the NJR tour) features Collins in multiple cities around the world, including London, New York City, Tokyo, Moscow, Sydney, Paris, St. Louis, Los Angeles (Hollywood), San Francisco, and Memphis (Graceland). At the end of the music video, Collins arrives home and hears a woman (presumably his wife) <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> asking him where he has been. He replies by saying he has been to some of the cities mentioned above. The woman replies [...] "You've been down at the pub, haven't you?", as Collins grins at the camera.|$|E
2500|$|Angel gilding {{was widely}} used by Chicago's stained glass studios in the 1920s and 30s {{to make a}} {{distinctive}} style of stained glass for Chicago's historic bungalows. These Prairie Style windows have a clear glass background with the designs picked out in opalescent glass and double-sided gold mirror. To make the double-sided [...] the studios angel gilded large sheets of thin (1.6mm, or 0.06inch) glass. A worker would cut two copies of the desired shape from the glass and place the pieces back to back in a single came. Because the pieces are gold on both sides, they catch and reflect the light whether the window is viewed <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> or from the street. Frank Lloyd Wright used double-sided angel gilded glass in many of his windows, including the now demolished Imperial Hotel in Tokyo.|$|E

50|$|At 5:00 am, Custer's {{exhausted}} men reached Champlain, and wearily set out too few pickets. The British 11th Hussars led by Lt.

The 6th Michigan fired on <b>the</b> Hussars <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> in Champlain, their Spencer Repeating Rifles far outweighing the British firepower. The nearby 1st Michigan cavalry charged into town with sabers in hand, and met the Hussars in swirling melee. Custer and Dunn engaged in single combat, but the fight broke them apart. The rapidly approaching 55th Foot turned the cavalry battle into an infantry battle, and the Americans fought on dismounted. Custer fed any newly arriving men into the battle {{as soon as they}} arrived, but his ammunition began to run low, and by 6:20 am, British artillery arrived to pour fire into the town. With the dawn, the Scots Fusilier Guards and the Second Battalion of the Grenadier Guards waded into Champlain, forcing Custer's men to the west. South of Coopersville Bridge, Wolseley had the difficult task of forcing his men to disengage from the XI Corps and retreat northwest to Champlain to escape the approaching XII Corps.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Infectious {{diseases}} {{caused by}} soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) are important diseases of humans, which affect {{about one third}} of the world’s population. Examination of soil can be used to estimate the risk of STH infection in humans. We carried out this survey to clarify the current status of soil contamination by parasite eggs and to assess the risk of STH infection. During survey periods, we examined soil, faeces, and the lifestyle of residents. Six genera and eight species of parasite eggs including Ascaris lumbricoides, Toxocara cati, Toxocara canis, and Trichuris trichiura were recovered from 85 out of 120 soil samples (71 %). Contamination of soil by parasite eggs had spread widely throughout the village, and 50 % of eggs recovered had already developed into fertilized eggs. It is remarkable that Ascaris eggs were recovered <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses.</b> Prevalence of STH in school children was 63 %. This may indicate that school or preschool children cause soil contamination. Some of the eggs recovered were not only from humans but also from dogs and cats. From the results obtained, the need for health education with regards to zoonoses was revealed because 77 % of fertilized Toxocara spp. eggs were detected. We conclude that the risk of STH infection in residents was extremely high, because the soil in this village was highly contaminated by infective parasite eggs...|$|R
