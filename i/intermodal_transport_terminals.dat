40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the impact of}} fuel price increases on the market area of <b>intermodal</b> <b>transport</b> <b>terminals.</b> Aim {{of this research is}} to determine whether an increase in fuel prices is sufficient enough to raise the market area of intermodal transport to the same degree that would be accomplished by stimulating intermodal transport through policy instruments. Therefore, several fuel price scenarios are analysed in order to verify the impact of different fuel price evolutions on the market area of unimodal road transport compared to intermodal transport in Belgium. The LAMBIT-model (Location Analysis for Belgian Intermodal Terminals), which is a GIS-based model (Macharis and Pekin, 2008), is used to analyse the different fuel price increases and enables a visualisation of the impact on the market area. The LAMBIT model incorporates the different network layers for each transport mode by setting up a GIS network that includes four different layers: the road network, the rail network, the inland waterways network and the final haulage network. The geographic locations of the intermodal terminals and the port of Antwerp are added as nodes in the network and the Belgian municipality centres are defined and connected to the different network layers. Based on the different fuel price scenarios representing respectively a fuel price increase with 10 % (low price case), 50 % (business as usual case) and 90 % (high price case), the results of the LAMBIT model show that the market areas rise in favour of intermodal barge/road and intermodal rail/road. Depending on the scenario, the degree of modal shift however differs. Additionally, in order to compare policy measures with the effect of a fuel price increase, the internalisation of the external costs is analysed with the LAMBIT model. For some years, the European Commission is supporting the idea that transportation costs should reflect the true impacts on environment and society, and is relentlessly pushing towards the so called 'internalisation of external costs' as a policy instrument in order to establish fair and efficient pricing of different transport modes. This requires monetarizing the external effects of transport and adding them to the already internalized costs in order to give the correct price signals. Results of this comparative analysis performed with the LAMBIT model are also presented in this paper. Intermodal transport Fuel price External costs Location analysis GIS network model...|$|E

40|$|There is {{the need}} to {{consider}} the establishment of strategic logistic centers such as a comprehensive <b>intermodal</b> freight <b>transport</b> <b>terminal</b> to support the tremendous pace of logistics development in Malaysia. There are some problems of transportation and goods distribution in this country such as documentation, custom clearance process, terminal locations, planning issues and transportation as well as distribution using service trucks. These are the consequences from having lack of sophisticated mechanism development of <b>intermodal</b> freight <b>transport</b> <b>terminals</b> in Malaysia. This has become a major challenge to the industry which must be overcome immediately. The existence of ports, inland ports and distriparks play an important role as a mechanism with infrastructures and operational systems such as an <b>intermodal</b> freight <b>transport</b> <b>terminal</b> which have been developed in several countries such as the United States as well as some parts in Europe and Asia. On that reason, the scope of study focuses on Peninsular Malaysia as a major research area where ports, inland ports and distriparks are fundamental by looking at the efforts of these terminals in handling transportation and goods distribution activities. This study focuses on three important elements in planning comprehensive ports, inland ports and distriparks in Malaysia namely; the physical elements, core-on site service elements and core-on site activity elements to enhance goods transportation and distribution system performance for these terminals. A survey was conducted by the researcher towards 257 freight forwarder companies and several discussions with public and private sectors in completing this study. The data was analysed using statistical and multiple regression analysis in order to improve the terminal and to measure the performance of the terminals studied. The main findings from the analysis showed that the terminals need improvement to increase transportation and distribution system performance. Findings also show that goods distribution system have a very high level of significance with the three <b>intermodal</b> freight <b>transport</b> <b>terminal</b> elements namely; physical elements, core-on site service elements and core-on site activity elements at ports, inland ports and distriparks in Peninsular Malaysia.

40|$|Europe has {{a strong}} {{commitment}} to the development of competitive and sustainable transportation. An intermediate objective cited in the “White Paper” is to shift 30 % of 300 km and above road freight transportation to more environmentally-friendly modes of transport such as rail and water by 2030. Improving and expanding the intermodal network is one way to achieve this goal. However, <b>intermodal</b> <b>transport</b> requires <b>intermodal</b> <b>terminals</b> where the transfer from one mode to another can occur. The location of those terminals is of strategic importance for the competitiveness of <b>intermodal</b> <b>transport.</b> The objective of this paper is therefore to develop a network design model which allows the optimal location of intermodal terminals to be determined, subject to both economic and environmental efficiency. Three possible combinations are considered: (i) Road-only, (ii) <b>Intermodal</b> <b>transport</b> using road (drayage) and rail (long-haul) and (iii) <b>Intermodal</b> <b>transport</b> using road (drayage) and inland waterways (long-haul). External costs are also included in the analysis, i. e. costs that are generated by an economic agent but supported by other agents of the society. This strategy is in line with the willingness of Europe to internalize external costs. The developed model can be used to test how modal split is influenced by the undertaken policies, such as internalizing external costs in the transportation costs.

40|$|AbstractIntermodality is an {{integral}} part of the sustainable mobility and its enhancement is of vital importance particularly, in high congested urban areas. The weak links in the overall <b>Intermodal</b> passenger <b>transport</b> chain are considered to be the Intermodal Terminals, as often inadequate planning leads to the reduction of the level of service of the means using the station, thus resulting in partial or total disdain for its users and the shift of the latter to other transport modes, mostly to private vehicles. Instead, an integrated design with emphasis on Intermodal Terminals which acts as the interface between the different modes not only increases the proportion of commuters who use urban public transport but also consolidates the overall public transport system of an urban area. Thus the main objective of this paper is to investigate how the provided level of service of passenger Intermodal facilities affects the commuters’ behavior regarding the modal choice. Towards this objective a categorization of the various terminals is attempted, considering their specific characteristics in terms of the means that they serve as well as the commuters that use them, in order to establish general design rules for each category. In this categorization all urban and suburban <b>Intermodal</b> public <b>transport</b> <b>Terminals</b> as well as Intermodal Terminals between means of public transport and private cars (Park and Ride facilities) were considered. Finally, a case study was executed based on a kind of a Revealed Preference Survey for the Intermodal Terminals of the city of Athens, in order to examine the impact of their operation on the number of interchanges between the various transport modes. The results of this study provide some useful points how a better organization of passenger Intermodal facilities affects the commuters’ behavior...|$|R

In the first chapter is a state-of-the-art analysis of <b>intermodal</b> <b>transport</b> in Czech Republic as well as in EU. Emphasis is placed on technological respect of <b>intermodal</b> <b>transport</b> and its specifics in confrontation with direct road transport. There is propounded a hypothesis that variable costs of <b>intermodal</b> <b>transport</b> including accompanied might be lower than for direct road transport.
