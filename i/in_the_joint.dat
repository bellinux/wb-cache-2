40|$|Collagen-induced {{arthritis}} was {{evoked by}} an injection of lipopolysaccharide and anti-type II collagen antibody in mice. <b>In</b> parallel with <b>the</b> onset of arthritis, granulocytes with large light scatter and a Mac- 1 + Gr- 1 + phenotype expanded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> of these mice. Lymphocytes with a CD 3 − B 220 + phenotype (i. e. B 220 + B cells) were the major population among lymphocyte subsets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints,</b> irrespective of disease. To determine {{the origin of}} these leucocyte populations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> and other organs, parabiotic experiments using CBF 1 Ly 5. 1 and CBF 1 Ly 5. 2 mice were conducted in mice with and without collagen-induced arthritis.

However, such a mixture was extremely delayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> and bone marrow, even in mice with arthritis. These results suggest that, because circulatory blood is not exchanged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints,</b> granulocytes and other lymphocytes are generated <b>in</b> situ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inflamed <b>joints</b> of mice with collagen-induced arthritis or are possibly supplied by the bone marrow.

40|$|Bacterial {{arthritis}} is {{a rapidly}} progressive and highly destructive joint disease in humans, with Staphylococcus aureus and Neisseria gonorrhoeae the major causative agents, although beta-hemolytic streptococci as well often induce the disease. We demonstrate here that intravenous inoculation of CD- 1 mice {{with the group}} A streptococcus (GAS) species Streptococcus pyogenes resulted in {{a high incidence of}} septic arthritis. Signs of arthritis emerged within the first few days after injection, and bacterial examinations revealed that colonization of <b>the</b> inoculated GAS <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arthritic <b>joints</b> persisted for 21 days. Induction of persistent septic arthritis was dependent on the number of microorganisms inoculated. Immunohistochemical staining of GAS with anti-GAS antibodies revealed colonization <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> of infected mice. Cytokine levels were quantified <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> and sera of infected mice by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. High levels of interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) and IL- 6 were detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> from 3 to 20 days after infection. We noted that an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amount of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), which is a key cytokine in osteoclastogenesis, was also evident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> of <b>the</b> infected mice.

30|$|This {{numerical}} {{study investigated}} the effects of different reinforcing details <b>in</b> beam-column <b>joints</b> on <b>the</b> blast resistance of <b>the</b> <b>joints.</b> Due to increasing manmade and/or natural high rate accidents such as impacts and blasts, the resistance of critical civil and military infrastructure or buildings should be sufficiently obtained under those high rate catastrophic loads. <b>The</b> beam-column <b>joint</b> <b>in</b> buildings is one of critical parts influencing on the resistance of those buildings under extreme events such as earthquakes, impacts and blasts. Thus, the details of reinforcements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> should be well designed for enhancing the resistance of <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> under <b>the</b> events. Parameters numerically investigated in this study include diagonal, flexural, and shear reinforcing steel bars. The failure mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> could be controlled by the level of tensile stress of reinforcing steel bars. Among various reinforcing details <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints,</b> diagonal reinforcement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> {{was found to be}} most effective for enhancing the resistance under blast loads. In addition, shear reinforcements also produced favourable effects on the blast resistance of beam-column joints.|$|R
