40|$|This study {{applied the}} uses and gratifications theory to {{determine}} how audience motives <b>for</b> <b>using</b> niche social network sites compared with motives <b>for</b> <b>using</b> popular social network sites. An online survey presented a single sample (N= 554) with items measuring motives <b>for</b> <b>using</b> the popular social network site Facebook alongside items measuring motives <b>for</b> <b>using</b> the niche social network site Ravelry for comparison. The results demonstrate {{that there is a}} significant amount of overlap between the motives <b>for</b> Ravelry <b>use</b> and <b>for</b> Facebook <b>use.</b> The motives of relaxing entertainment, expressive information sharing, habitual pass time, social interaction, cool new technology, and professional advancement emerged during separate factor analyses of both the Ravelry and Facebook use motive scales. New friendships emerged only as a motive <b>for</b> Ravelry <b>use.</b> The results also showed the most salient motive <b>for</b> Facebook <b>use</b> was social interaction where the most salient motives <b>for</b> <b>using</b> Ravelry were relaxing entertainment and new friendships. The strongest motive <b>for</b> <b>using</b> Facebook related to relationships maintenance, which supports findings of past research. In contrast, Ravelry use motives show members are seeking new relationships through the niche social network site. Implications of the significant differences between motives <b>for</b> <b>using</b> the niche social network site and the popular social network site are discussed. Additional research is suggested to refine the current conceptual definition of social network site and to classify social network sites...|$|R

40|$|Interval routing is a {{well-known}} space-efficient routing method for computer networks. For longest routing path analysis, researchers have focused on lower bounds for many years.
