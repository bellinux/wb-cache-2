25|$|There is a {{long history}} of using both fag and <b>faggot</b> in popular culture, usually in {{reference}} to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman's 1995 documentary The Celluloid Closet, based on Vito Russo's book of the same name notes the use of fag and <b>faggot</b> throughout Hollywood film history. The Think Before You Speak campaign has sought to stop fag and gay being used as generic insults.|$|E
25|$|The group {{originally}} {{wanted to}} title the album Don't Be a <b>Faggot,</b> but Columbia Records refused {{to release the}} album under this title—arguing that it was homophobic—and pressured Russell Simmons, the Beastie Boys' manager and head of Def Jam Recordings at the time, into forcing them to choose another name. Adam Horovitz has since apologized for the album's earlier title.|$|E
50|$|Like most lace fabrics, <b>faggoting</b> {{has little}} {{structural}} strength and deforms easily, {{so it has}} little tendency to curl despite being asymmetrical. <b>Faggoting</b> is stretchy and open, and most <b>faggoting</b> stitches look the same on both sides, making them ideal for garments like lacy scarves or stockings.|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} of homosexuals resemble {{the type of}} the inconspicuous son of good family, who attaches greatest importance to appear virile. His greatest enemy are flamboyant <b>faggots.</b> <b>Faggots</b> are not as phoney as the bourgeois gay. <b>Faggots</b> exaggerate their gay attributes and make light of them. By doing so, they question the norms of our society and show {{what it means to}} be gay.|$|R
25|$|Use of fag and <b>faggot</b> as {{the term}} for an effeminate man has become {{understood}} as an Americanism in British English, primarily due to entertainment media use in films and television series imported from the United States. When Labour MP Bob Marshall-Andrews was overheard supposedly using the word in a bad-tempered informal exchange with a straight colleague in the House of Commons lobby in November 2005, it {{was considered to be}} homophobic abuse.|$|E
25|$|While the Arundel affinity's {{dominance}} {{was generally}} imposed through adept {{use of the}} law and civil authority, there was an undertow of violence and intimidation and this became increasingly open and notorious after 1410, as Arundel's affinity clashed with supporters of most of the county's other magnates. Burley was very close to the perpetrators of violence: his son, his former ward and his future executors were involved {{in some of the most}} sensational outrages. These led to complaints about the prevalence of bad governance and murder in Shropshire at the Fire and <b>Faggot</b> Parliament, held in Leicester in 1414. Many cases came to court at the last ever regional session of the Court of King's Bench, held at Shrewsbury in Trinity term of 1414. Henry V was present in person, along with William Hankford, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench, to make a show of taking seriously the complaints against his most powerful supporter in the region, and much of what is known of the violence is derived from allegations made at that court.|$|E
25|$|In April 1413 a {{group of}} Midlands gentry, led by William Lichfield, Cornwall's son-in-law, made mainprise of £100 for him at Westminster and he undertook, under a pain of £500, to do no harm to anyone. This was a prelude to a case tried at Court of King's Bench at Shrewsbury in Trinity term. Henry V was present in person, along with William Hankford, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench, in {{response}} to complaints about the prevalence of bad governance and murder in Shropshire made at the Fire and <b>Faggot</b> Parliament in Leicester, earlier that year. The business was dominated by the aftermath of large-scale violence between the Arundel affinity and the followers of Lord Furnival in 1413. However, Cornwall was accused of procuring Henry Cornwall of Catsley, possibly his own illegitimate son, to commit a murder and of harbouring him after the event. Henry {{seems to have had}} a reputation for violence, as he was also accused of a serious assault on a cleric in 1412. The murder had taken place in August 1413 at Sir John Cornwall's own manorial court in Kinlet, emphasising the likelihood of his complicity.|$|E

Six weeks after enlisting, she {{was sent to the}} discharge unit. She was allegedly being bullied, and in the opinion of another soldier, was having a breakdown. The soldier told The Guardian: [...] "The kid was barely five foot ... He was a runt, so pick on him. He's crazy, pick on him. He's a <b>faggot,</b> pick on him. The guy took it from every side. He couldn't please anyone." [...] Nicks writes that Manning, who was used to being bullied, fought back—if the drill sergeants screamed at her, she would scream at them—to the point where they started calling her [...] "General Manning".|$|E

2500|$|An {{alternative}} {{possibility is}} that the word is connected with the practice of fagging in British private schools, in which younger boys performed (potentially sexual) duties for older boys, although the word <b>faggot</b> was never used in this context, only fag. There is {{a reference to the}} word <b>faggot</b> being used in 17th-century Britain to refer to a [...] "man hired into military service simply to fill out the ranks at muster", but there is no known connection with the word's modern pejorative usage.|$|E

2500|$|Originally {{confined}} to the United States, {{the use of the}} words fag and <b>faggot</b> as epithets for gay men has spread elsewhere in the English-speaking world, but {{the extent to which they}} are used in this sense has varied outside the context of imported US popular culture. In the UK and some other countries, the words queer, homo, and poof are much more common as pejorative terms for gay men. The word <b>faggot</b> in the UK typically refers to a kind of meatball, while fag is most commonly used as a slang term for [...] "cigarette".|$|E
