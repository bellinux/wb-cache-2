5|$|Eleven {{years into}} Sunday's evangelistic career, {{both he and}} his wife had been pushed to their {{emotional}} limits. Long separations had exacerbated his natural <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>inadequacy</b> and insecurity. As a product of a childhood that could well be described as a series of losses, he was extremely dependent on his wife's love and encouragement. For her part, Nell found it increasingly difficult to handle household responsibilities, the needs of four children (including a newborn), and the long-distance emotional welfare of her husband. His ministry was also expanding, and he needed an administrator, a job for which his wife was ideally suited. In 1908, the Sundays decided to entrust their children to a nanny so that Nell could manage the revival campaigns.|$|E

Both conditions are anxiety disorders which can be highly disruptive to everyday functioning yet are often concealed by those affected, out of shame, or <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>inadequacy.</b> She has said her anxiety disorders make it impossible for her to go to the cinema or board an airplane (in an interview she wished to be able to fly to New York to see the skyscrapers one day before dying), and incapable of taking part in any ceremony.|$|E

He was also attracted to the field's freedom, artistic nature, and lack of discipline, which was different from his experience in boarding school. Field put off university when The Cockroaches became successful, but he was dissatisfied with touring and plagued by [...] "perhaps irrational, but very real, <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>inadequacy</b> and depression". By his mid-twenties, {{he decided that he}} did not want to tour any longer, so he took two breaks. His first break was as an infantry soldier, medic, and rifleman in the 5th/7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Australia's regular army from 1982 to 1985. He played the bagpipes in parades and on training missions, but ended his military service in July 1985 and suffered from a bad back as a result of his training. He also went backpacking in the U.K., listening to roots music, to children's music by artists like Raffi, and to recordings of children's books.|$|E

The author traces back the origin <b>of</b> this <b>inadequacy</b> to the historical circumstances that led an influential group of English economists in 1815 to put forward the “Law of diminishing returns” to land cultivation, jointly with the theory of rent. He shows how technical progress, though not denied in principle, was eliminated by assumption for analytical reasons. That choice - he argues – arose from historical circumstances specific to a particular country in a particular time. Yet it has influenced the development of economic theory ever since. Later on, neoclassical economists have further exacerbated the effects of that initial choice. The author argues in favour {{of going back to}} the origin and reversing the Classical choice...|$|R

At Jim's new company, Pam gives Darryl a thumbs up as he heads into the interview room, and then is chatted up by an employee who says [...] "Jim speaks about you all the time" [...] and we [...] "can't wait for you to move here." [...] The thought of moving to Philadelphia disturbs her. Meanwhile, Darryl initially fumbles his interview due to nerves and <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>inadequacy,</b> but everyone else helps calm him down, and he makes a strong reversal. Darryl concludes the interview by attempting to shoot a basket with the room's sports decorations, but instead knocks a light fixture into the fish tank, electrocuting all the fish. Pam commiserates with Darryl over this embarrassing misstep. Jim returns to inform Darryl that although {{he will have to}} pay for the fish, he has the job. During the drive home, Darryl gushes over his new job and the chance to live in Philadelphia while Pam worries about where she and her family will be in the future.|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{uses her}} many roles, incarnations, and identities {{throughout}} her books {{to illustrate how}} oppression and personal history are interrelated. For example, in Caged Bird, Angelou demonstrates the [...] "racist habit" [...] of renaming African Americans, as shown when her white employer insists on calling her [...] "Mary". [...] Angelou describes the employer's renaming as the [...] "hellish horror of being 'called out of [...] name'". [...] Scholar Debra Walker King calls it a racist insult and an assault against Maya's race and self-image. The renaming emphasizes Maya's <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>inadequacy</b> and denigrates her identity, individuality, and uniqueness. Maya understands that she is being insulted and rebels by breaking Mrs. Cullinan's favorite dish, but feels vindicated when, as she leaves her employer's home, Mrs. Cullinan finally gets her name right. Another incident {{in the book that}} solidifies Maya's identity is her trip to Mexico with her father, when she has to drive a car for the first time. Contrasted with her experience in Stamps, Maya is finally [...] "in control of her fate". [...] This experience is central to Maya's growth, as is the incident that immediately follows it, her short period of homelessness after arguing with her father's girlfriend. These two incidents give Maya a knowledge of self-determination and confirm her self-worth.|$|E

His parents had politely declined several such proposals, on the plea that Manvendra required {{time to recover}} from his divorce. Finally, they decided that nothing but remarriage would bring Manvendra out of his depression, and began pressurising him to accept a certain proposal. They repeatedly dinned into him {{the fact that as}} a prince, he should be a role-model, not a depressed person, and that he should do his duty to his family and forefathers.

By the time {{he and his wife}} separated in 1978, he was already under tranquilizers. He started to drink and considered becoming homeless, even sleeping rough three times to test himself. After one of his sons threatened to never see him again if he did not stop drinking, he joined a counselling group. In 1979, when he was working for an insurance company, still trying for reconciliation with his estranged wife, he attended a discussion in a local bookshop for the launch of the French edition of Heinz Heger's The Men with the Pink Triangle, a memoir of the concentration camp experiences of Josef Kohout. After the event Seel met with the speakers, and a meeting was organized for the next day. Heger's book inspired Seel's coming out as a gay man and as a victim of the Nazis.

[...] She {{is said to be a}} descendant of Louis XIII of France through her grandmother, Hermine, Baroness Collard, from a liaison between Stéphanie Félicité, comtesse de Genlis and Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. Marie lost her father to a hunting accident at the age of twelve; her mother, who remarried soon after, died seven years later. [...] At eighteen, Marie was adopted by her maternal aunt, who was married to the secretary-general of the Bank of France. The two women did not get along. [...] Despite the fact that her foster parents treated her well and sent her to the best schools, Marie was kept aware of her status as a poor relative. Because she attended an elite school, Marie interacted with daughters of the moneyed aristocracy. She used every means to persuade them that she too came from a wealthy family, and she became envious when she saw her friends marrying rich noblemen. [...] However, Marie had little say in the matter of matrimony. [...] Her marriage dowry of 90,000 francs, while considerable, was not that impressive considering her family's status, and Marie was left with <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>inadequacy,</b> which fueled her pride and ambition.|$|E

Because carrying out the work required a person possessing both technical knowledge of work methods and subject knowledge in lexicography, {{it was difficult to}} proceed efficiently. Those with such expertise had other obligations that demanded most of their time and work capacity. Still, the club had chosen a dictionary committee that was committed to push the project forward. In order that the work would not stagnate, they began proofreading at club meetings and on their days off from work. This attracted many participants for several years, but the corpus was huge, and the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>inadequacy</b> had slowed the work when Kjell Heggvold Ullestad came into the picture.|$|R

50|$|Linguistic {{insecurity}} {{refers to}} <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> anxiety, self-consciousness, {{or lack of}} confidence in the mind of a speaker surrounding the use of their own language. Often, this anxiety comes from speakers' belief that their use of language does not conform to the perceived standard and/or the style of language expected by the speakers' interlocutor(s). Linguistic insecurity is situationally induced and is often a matter <b>of</b> the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>inadequacy</b> regarding personal performance in certain contexts, rather than a fixed attribute of an individual. This insecurity can lead to stylistic, and phonetic shifts away from an affected speaker's default speech variety; these shifts may be performed consciously {{on the part of the}} speaker, or may be reflective of an unconscious effort to conform to a more prestigious or context-appropriate style of speech. Linguistic insecurity is linked to the perception of speech styles in any community, and so may vary based on socioeconomic class and gender.
