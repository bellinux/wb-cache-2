40|$|Abstract—The Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) market {{once belonged}} to {{professional}} companies only. Now many amateur pilots fly cheap, smartphone controlled models available in any electronic store. Due to altitude, speed, and weight, these flying objects can cause damage and injury. Hence, a way to manage them is necessary. This paper presents a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) system comprising three components: a UAS electronic identification plate with an embedded logger, a ground <b>identification</b> <b>equipment,</b> and a Traffic Routing System (TRS). This UTM system uses the air parcel model, which divides the low altitude airspace in a 3 -D air parcel map. In this system, land parcel owners possess the airspace above their real estate and approve or disallow overflights. The adoption of the described UTM allows cities to control UASs, to detect non-compliant flights, and to identify pilots. I...|$|E

40|$|In {{a healthy}} heart, {{there is no}} any {{abnormal}} blood flow takes place inside, {{in addition to the}} usual blood circulating pattern. However when the valves or tissues inside the heart are in diseased conditions, this usual blood flow pattern gets changed. As a result, abnormal sounds are produced with the normal heart beat sound.

This paper describes an electronic stethoscopic device that {{can be used as a}} stethoscope as well as murmur <b>identification</b> <b>equipment.</b> Chest piece of an ordinary stethoscope has been used to capture the heart beat with a microphone attached to it.

The primary objective of the analysis was to better characterize and parameterize the regional background reflectance in order to improve the accuracy of the aerosol optical depth algorithms currently in use. A secondary objective was to develop a method of determining the geographic extent and basic intensity of the ocean turbidity. The intent of the study was to explore how visible wavelength solar radiation is affected by its interaction with the regional environment. The work has operational significance because many types of military systems operate using visible wavelength energy and are greatly affected by scattering particles either airborne or suspended in the water column.

40|$|Understanding the {{molecular}} and biochemical {{mechanisms by which}} parasites invade their host is key to rational vaccine and drug development. The proteins released by larvae of a parasitic blood fluke as they invade human skin were identified using high-resolution protein <b>identification</b> <b>equipment</b> and software. In addition, the proteins in human skin that serve as mechanical or biochemical barriers to parasite invasion were also identified. Among the proteins released by the parasite larvae were enzymes that degrade host tissue and immune defense molecules and other factors that protect the larvae from host defense mechanisms. Analysis of specific host proteins in skin invaded by cercariae served to highlight both the tissue degradation that facilitates cercarial invasion, and the host defenses that attempt to arrest or retard invasion. Proteins abundant in other skin diseases or UV and heat-stressed skin were not abundant in skin invaded by cercariae, suggesting that results did not reflect general stress in the surgically removed skin specimen. Abundant immune response proteins in human skin form a biochemical barrier that complements the structural barrier of the epidermis, basement membrane, and dermis. The fragmentation {{of some of these}} host proteins suggests that breaching of host defenses by cercariae includes specific degradation of immune response proteins and overwhelming the host protease inhibitor repertoire...|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} major {{problems}} in the intermodal network. First, {{there is a lack}} of high-speed data transfer between shippers, carriers, terminal operators, and government agencies. Another major problem is a “missing link ” between many large port facilities and rail operations. Also, there is no standardization on information, such as commodity classification, load manifests, <b>equipment</b> <b>identification,</b> physical <b>equipment,</b> such as a standard container, etc. is available (1). There is a need for improvements in the transit and delivery times. The VP-Intermodal of Santa Fe R. R. was quoted as saying that the cycle time between loadings for intermodal trailers is 15 days whereas trucks is only seven days. A study at Conrail’s intermodal terminal in Morrisville, PA showed that goods were in possession of the company for an average of 2. 3 days from receipt to departure of the shipment. Between 1992 and 1994, annual intermodal loading increased from 3. 1 million to just over 8. 1 million.
