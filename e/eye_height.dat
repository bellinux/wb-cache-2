25|$|The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Committee on Physical Agents has {{established}} a TLV for UV-C exposure to avoid such skin and eye injuries among those most susceptible. For 254nm UV, this TLV is 6 mJ/cm² over an eight-hour period. The TLV function differs by wavelengths because of variable energy and potential for cell damage. This TLV {{is supported by the}} International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection and is used in setting lamp safety standards by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. When TUSS was planned, and until quite recently, this TLV was interpreted as if eye exposure in rooms was continuous over eight hours and at the highest eye-level irradiance found in the room. In those highly unlikely conditions, a 6.0 mJ/cm² dose is reached under the ACGIH TLV after just eight hours of continuous exposure to an irradiance of 0.2 μW/cm². Thus, 0.2 μW/cm² was widely interpreted as the upper permissible limit of irradiance at <b>eye</b> <b>height.</b>|$|E
2500|$|When {{determining}} corner sight distance, a {{set back}} distance for the vehicle {{waiting at the}} crossroad must be assumed. Set back for {{the driver of the}} vehicle on the crossroad has been standardized by some state MUTCDs and design manuals to be up to a minimum of 10 feet plus the shoulder width of the major road but not less than 15 feet. However, the Federal MUTCD requires that a stop line, if used, shall be at least 4 feet from the nearest travel lane. Line of sight for corner sight distance is to be determined from a 3 and 1/2-foot <b>eye</b> <b>height</b> at the vehicle driver's location on the minor road to a 4 and 1/4-foot object height {{in the center of the}} approaching lane of the major road.

40|$|Phosphorescent square tiles (arranged {{to yield}} a single image size) were viewed in the dark by 56 monocular {{observers}} who utilized a chinrest. The targets were placed at one of three horizontal distances and at one of three <b>eye</b> <b>heights,</b> allowing us to study the relative effect of height in the visual field (HVF) and sagittal distance on observers' verbal reports of the horizontal distance at which the object lay (near, middle, or far). In Experiment 1, we found that reports covaried primarily with HVF and, as predicted, they exhibited a weak paradoxical inverse relation with horizontal distance. In a second and third experiment, a visible surface was placed under the targets at the three <b>eye</b> <b>heights</b> in both dark and fully lighted conditions. In this situation, the inverse distance relation disappeared, and HVF no longer influenced the judgments of most observers. The results show that information projected from relevant support surfaces is essential for veridical information about object distance. These results raise fundamental issues for perceptual researchers regarding how to decide when a cue has been properly delineated, given {{the assumption that the}} relation between a cue and what it specifies is probabilistic. ...|$|R

40|$|Glare screen {{barrier is}} an {{important}} element in highway safety engineering. Height and spacing of glare screen barrier block are important parameters in highway design, since vehicles of different driver <b>eye</b> <b>heights</b> with different head light heights are plying on highways. Selection of spacing of glare block is a complex problem. A model has been proposed to determine optimum spacing of glare block for horizontal alignment. Glare block can be placed perpendicular to the road or inclined by a certain angle to obtain optimum cost. It is found that spacing is optimal when the sum of inclination angle(x) and degree of curvature (θ) is 70 º; i. e., x+ θ = 70 °...|$|R

Even though the force required for the task itself did not vary, changing the height of the handle forced each subject t o exert a force to maintain his own body position. This force exerted by the subject was minimized when the handle was at chest height. The only previous studies on optimum work heights have concerned work surface location.
