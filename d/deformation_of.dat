5|$|Experiments and ice {{modeling}} {{published in}} 2016, indicate that tidal flexing dissipation can generate one {{order of magnitude}} more heat in Europa's ice than scientists had previously assumed. Their results indicates {{that most of the}} heat generated by the ice actually comes from the ice's crystalline structure (lattice) as a result of deformation, and not friction between the ice grains. The greater the <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> the ice sheet, the more heat is generated.|$|E
5|$|Although stiff {{wheels are}} more energy {{efficient}} than {{other means of}} locomotion when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} experiment {{carried out}} by Wu was the confirmation of the E. M. L. Pryce and John Clive Ward's calculations on the correlation of the quantum polarizations of two photons propagating in opposite directions. This was the first experimental confirmation of quantum results relevant {{to a pair of}} entangled photons as applicable to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox. Wu later conducted research into the molecular changes in the <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> hemoglobins that cause sickle-cell disease. She also did research on magnetism, and on the Mössbauer effect during the 1960s. She wrote a textbook with , Beta Decay, which was published in 1966, and became a standard reference on the subject.|$|E

5|$|Concepts {{related to}} force include: thrust, which {{increases}} the velocity of an object; drag, which decreases the velocity of an object; and torque, which produces changes in rotational speed of an object. In an extended body, each part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces through the body is the internal mechanical stress. Such internal mechanical stresses cause no accelation of that body as the forces balance one another. Pressure, the distribution of many small forces applied over an area of a body, is a simple type of stress that if unbalanced can cause the body to accelerate. Stress usually causes <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> solid materials, or flow in fluids.|$|E
5|$|Doors and vents {{often had}} sills of {{carefully}} ground flat stone slabs and lintels constructed from {{a row of}} thin wood beams. Chacoan masons also frequently included intramural beams – horizontal logs completely enclosed in the wall core – which were probably intended to reduce horizontal <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> the wall. The interior walls of great houses were typically covered in a rock veneer. Judd identified four distinct types, and his typology is the most commonly accepted in the region. Chetro Ketl's interior walls, particularly those in the eastern wing, were covered in a Type IV veneer characterized by uniform pieces of sandstone with little to no exposed mortar.
