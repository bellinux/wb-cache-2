5|$|The defense {{maintained}} that the evidence against Desha was largely circumstantial. They said that Desha's personal items {{could easily have been}} planted where they were found. They pointed out that, despite the stab wounds on Baker's body, no blood was found on the ground near the road or on the path along which the murderer had <b>dragged</b> <b>the</b> body to conceal it. Finally, they contended that, although the days had been unusually warm and wild boars were known to inhabit the area, Baker's body showed no obvious signs of decomposition or disturbance by animals, as might have been expected had it been there for six days, as the prosecution had charged.|$|E

5|$|After {{the arrival}} of the strikebreakers on the {{afternoon}} of November 2, Indianapolis Police Chief Martin Hyland had mounted city police escort them from Indianapolis Union Station to the company's maintenance and storage carhouses, one block south of the terminal building. The police broke a path through the strikers to allow the strikebreakers into the building so they could prepare to launch the cars. Organized labor leaders held two mass meetings and unions across the city agreed to send additional men to support the strikers against the strikebreakers. A riot began as the strikebreakers attempted to restore transit service. Whenever the strikebreakers launched a streetcar from the storage barns, the strikers attacked them with rocks and brick. They boarded the streetcars, <b>dragged</b> <b>the</b> crews from the cars and lit the cars on fire. Many injuries occurred on both sides and ambulances were called to carry the injured to a hospital. After the destruction of six cars, the strikebreakers abandoned their attempts to restart service.|$|E
5|$|By August 2012, {{the very}} low European carbon prices <b>dragged</b> <b>the</b> NZU price down to $NZ4.55 per tonne of carbon. In mid September 2012, NZUs were selling for $NZ4.20 a tonne. In late October 2012, New Zealand carbon prices dropped to about $NZ1 a tonne for {{some types of}} credits. On 10 December 2012, the NZU spot price was $2.70 and it had {{declined}} by 72 percent over the 2012 year. In February 2013, Westpac's carbon dealing desk noted that imported European carbon credits were trading for 28 NZ cents and the price for NZUs was $NZ2.50.

5|$|During Euro 2008, new Dutch manager Marco van Basten {{changed the}} side's {{formation}} to 4–2–3–1, preferring the midfield trio of Rafael van der Vaart, Wesley Sneijder and Dirk Kuyt, with Robben left to battle {{for a position}} with Robin van Persie on the wing. In the group match against France, which the Netherlands won 4–1, Robben was brought on at half-time. He <b>dragged</b> <b>the</b> ball {{out of reach of}} a defender near the half-way line and paced his way ahead of three defenders, then crossed straight to Van Persie, who powered a shot into the goal past France goalkeeper Grégory Coupet. At 2–0, Thierry Henry scored a goal for France, making it 2–1, but almost directly after the restart, Robben was played through by Sneijder and he ran at the France goal and was forced into an acute angle, but despite the angle, he shot the ball into the net past Coupet.|$|E

5|$|During the Battle of Britain, on 27 October 1940, a Messerschmitt Me 109E {{flown by}} Fw Lothar Schieverhofer, of 3 Gruppe, Jagdgeschwader 52, was damaged in a dogfight with Supermarine Spitfire IIa P7494 of No. 74 Squadron RAF, flown by Plt Off Peter Chesters. The Messerschmitt made a wheels-up landing at RAF Penshurst, where Chesters also landed {{a few minutes}} later as he was short of fuel. Chesters <b>dragged</b> <b>the</b> German from his aircraft. Schieverhofer spat in his face, and a fist-fight {{developed}} with both combatants swearing at each other in German. The fight was broken up by the arrival of an ARP Warden, a policeman and a soldier. Chesters was forced to hand back Schieverhofer's Iron Cross, which he had snatched as a souvenir, and instead took the first aid kit from the Messerschmitt. Schieverhofer was taken away from RAF Penshurst as a prisoner of war.|$|E
5|$|During {{the seventeenth}} century the bonshō was also a symbol of a temple's leadership; {{possession}} of the bell indicated ownership of the associated temple. As a result, bells were often stolen; the folk hero Benkei {{is said to have}} <b>dragged</b> <b>the</b> three-ton bell of Mii-dera temple up Mount Hiei during one such theft. The deep scratches in the Benkei bell, which is still displayed at Mii-dera, are said in the legend {{to be the result of}} Benkei's kicking the bell all the way back to the monastery when he discovered that it would not toll for him. The Benkei bell is also associated with the legendary hero Tawara Tōda, who originally donated it to the Mii-dera temple. He acquired it as a gift from the dragon deity Ryūjin, after saving the god from a giant centipede.|$|E
5|$|Fitzgibbons {{argues that}} it was not {{impossible}} for Cromwell's body to have been substituted before his posthumous execution. One proposition is that Sergeant Norfolke, who exhumed the bodies from the abbey, found the tombs of Cromwell and Ireton empty, prompting the government to sanction an exhumation of two other graves. This has been put forward because Bradshaw's body arrived at the Red Lion Inn at Holborn a day after Cromwell and Ireton, prompting rumour that he was the only real body to be hanged at Tyburn. An alternative theory is that Cromwell's friends bribed the guards attending Cromwell's body, “privately interring him in a small paddock near Holborn”, so that when the sledges <b>dragged</b> <b>the</b> bodies to the gallows, Cromwell's body was already buried. The faces on the three bodies, although heavily shrouded, were clearly visible; and since no witnesses expressed any doubt that the bodies were those of Cromwell and Ireton, there is no evidence supporting this theory.|$|E

50|$|An {{aircraft}} {{propulsion system}} must achieve two things. First, the thrust from the propulsion system must balance <b>the</b> <b>drag</b> of <b>the</b> airplane when the airplane is cruising. And second, the thrust from the propulsion system must exceed <b>the</b> <b>drag</b> of <b>the</b> airplane for the airplane to accelerate. In fact, {{the greater the}} difference between the thrust and <b>the</b> <b>drag,</b> called <b>the</b> excess thrust, the faster the airplane will accelerate.|$|R
5|$|Sonderkommandos (special work crews {{forced to}} work at the gas chambers) wearing gas masks then <b>dragged</b> <b>the</b> bodies from the chamber. The victims' glasses, {{artificial}} limbs, jewelry, and hair were removed, and any dental work was extracted so the gold could be melted down. If the gas chamber was crowded, which they typically were, the corpses were found half-squatting, their skin discolored pink with red and green spots, with some found foaming at their mouths, or bleeding from their ears. The corpses were burned in the nearby incinerators, and the ashes were buried, thrown in the river, or used as fertilizer. With the Soviet Red Army approaching through Poland, the last mass gassing at Auschwitz took place on 30 October 1944. In November 1944, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, ordered gassing operations to cease across the Reich.|$|E
5|$|During an {{engagement}} early in June 1915 Walpole single-handedly rescued a wounded soldier; his Russian comrades refused {{to help and}} Walpole carried {{one end of a}} stretcher and <b>dragged</b> <b>the</b> man to safety. For this he was awarded the Cross of Saint George; General Lechitsky presented him with the medal in August. After his tour of duty Walpole returned to Petrograd. Among the city's attractions for him was the presence of Konstantin Somov, a painter with whom he had formed a close relationship. He remained there until October 1915, when he returned to England. He visited his family, stayed with Percy Anderson in London, telephoned Henry James in Rye, and retreated to a cottage he had bought in Cornwall. In January 1916 he was asked by the Foreign Office to return to Petrograd. Russians were being subjected to highly effective German propaganda. The writer Arthur Ransome, Petrograd correspondent of The Daily News, had successfully lobbied {{for the establishment of a}} bureau to counter the German efforts, and the British ambassador, Sir George Buchanan, wanted Walpole to take charge.|$|E

25|$|On 5 March, about 7000-8000 people {{broke into}} the Dimapur Central Jail. They <b>dragged</b> <b>the</b> accused out, while parading him naked, pelted him with stones and beat him. They <b>dragged</b> <b>the</b> accused to a clock tower about 7km away, by tying a rope to his waist from a motorcycle. The accused died on the way.

The Superintendent of Police Meren Jamir later said that the mob was led {{by a group of}} a few hundred school and college girls in uniforms, which prevented the police from using more force. Jamir said that the initial crowd was small and they had been repelled by baton charges. But, later the mob returned with larger numbers. Even though 8 companies of security forces were present at the jail, they failed to stop the mob. The police later said that there was at least one former inmate of the prison, who knew the interior layout of the jail.|$|E
