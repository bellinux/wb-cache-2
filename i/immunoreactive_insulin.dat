40|$|The glucoregulatory role {{of insulin}} in adult {{subjects}} is undisputed. However, less {{is known about}} the secretion of insulin and its actions in the neonatal period, either for healthy subjects, or for those at risk of disordered blood glucose homoeostasis. The relationships between blood glucose and plasma <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>insulin</b> concentrations were therefore examined in 52 healthy children (aged 1 month- 10 years), 67 appropriate birth weight for gestational age (AGA) term infants, and 39 AGA preterm neonates. In children and AGA neonates, plasma <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>insulin</b> concentration was positively related to blood glucose concentration. However, although both groups of neonates had significantly lower blood glucose concentrations than children, plasma <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>insulin</b> concentrations were significantly higher in both term and preterm neonates, when compared with children. The variation in plasma <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>insulin</b> concentrations was greater for neonates than for children. These data suggest, that compared with older subjects, plasma <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>insulin</b> concentrations are high in newborn babies and that neonatal pancreatic insulin secretion is less closely linked to circulating blood glucose concentrations.

40|$|Human diabetics on {{intermediate}} and long-acting insulin occasionaly become hypoglycemic during exercise. We {{have shown}} previously that during exercise, hypoglycemia {{did not occur}} in depancreatized insulin-infused dogs because the increments in glucose production and utilization were proportional and of the same magnitude as in normal dogs. Therefore, to elucidate the mechanism of the glucose-lowering effect of strenuous exercise, we measured glucose production and utilization, metabolic clearance of glucose, and serum <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>insulin</b> in postabsorptive depancreatized dogs 8 h after a subcutaneous injection of protamine zinc and crystalline insulin. During rest, plasma glucose was stable, but ranged between hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia was associated with overproduction of glucose, indicating insulin deficiency despite normal or elevated serum <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>insulin.</b> Glucose clearance, as in normal dogs, increased threefold but glucose production increased only marginally (50 %) and, consequently, glucose decreased in plasma. The decrease of plasma glucose was directly proportional to the preexercise concentration and production of glucose. The magnitude of inhibition glucose production was not correlated with the serum <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>insulin</b> indicating either that some released insluin was not active or that a moderate <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>insulin</b> increment induced a near-maximal inhibition. It is concluded that in depancreatized dogs injected with protamine zinc insulin, exercise accelerates mobilization of insulin from its injection site presumably because of increased blood and lymph flow.

We compared discrimination of commonly used in vivo tests of beta-cell function {{across a range of}} glucose tolerance in seven subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), eight subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and nine subjects with type 2 diabetes. In random order, each subject underwent two of each of the following tests: 1) frequently sampled 0. 3 -g/kg intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT) with MinMod analysis; 2) homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) from three samples at 5 -min intervals with a model incorporating immunoreactive or specific insulin measurements; and 3) continuous infusion of 180 mg x min(- 1) x m(- 2) glucose with model assessment (CIGMA) of three samples at 50, 55, and 60 min (1 -h CIGMA) and at 110, 115, and 120 min (2 -h CIGMA). The discrimination of each test was assessed by the ratio of the within-subject SD to the underlying between-subject SD, the discriminant ratio (DR). The degree to which tests measured the same physiological variable was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient adjusted for attenuation due to test imprecision. An unbiased line of equivalence, taking into account the imprecision of both tests, was used to compare results. Beta-cell function assessed from HOMA and beta-cell function assessed from CIGMA (CIGMA%beta) (using <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>insulin)</b> had higher DRs than first-phase intravenous glucose tolerance test-derived incremental insulin peak, area, insulin-to-glucose index, and acute insulin response to glucose from FSIVGTT-MinMod. CIGMA%beta (<b>immunoreactive</b> <b>insulin)</b> had the highest DR. FSIVGTT-derived first-phase insulin response tests correlated only moderately with HOMA and CIGMA. Using specific rather than <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>insulin</b> for HOMA and CIGMA did not improve discriminatory power.

The mean +/- SEM fasting values of plasma and salivary <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>insulin</b> were significantly higher in diabetic patients and obese non-diabetic subjects than in normal volunteers (p less than 0. 05). During the glucose challenge, the increase of salivary insulin was related with that of plasma in the three groups of subjects, with a time lag in normal and obese subjects. In normal volunteers, plasma and salivary peak values were respectively 49. 5 +/- 13. 4 microU/ml (p less than 0. 05 vs obese subjects) at 60 min and 12. 0 +/- 3. 3 microU/min (p less than 0. 05 vs obese subjects) at 120 min; in diabetic patients, the values were 51. 7 +/- 5. 6 microU/ml (p less than 0. 05 vs obese subjects) and 14. 6 +/- 4. 1 microU/min at 120 min; in obese subjects, the peak value for plasma insulin was 111. 5 +/- 40. 1 microU/ml at 90 min and for salivary insulin 15. 6 +/- 5. 1 microU/min at 120 min. A positive linear relationship was shown between plasma and salivary insulin during the oral glucose tolerance test. The identity of salivary insulin was assessed by reversed-phase HPLC. We conclude that salivary <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>insulin</b> can be found in Type 2 diabetic patients and in obese non-diabetic subjects, as well as normal volunteers, that plasma and salivary insulin are related after a glucose load, and that differences exist in salivary insulin secretion patterns among the three groups of subjects...|$|E

The present study was performed to examine the relationships between fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and various indices in 93 postmenopausal women with primary hyperparathyroidism. Bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition were measured by dual-energy Xray absorptiometry. Body weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass and % fat were positively related to FPG. Serum levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) as well as bone metabolic indices were not related to FPG and <b>immunoreactive</b> <b>insulin</b> levels.

Exocrine pancreas was positive for chromogranin A. Not previously recognized in fish, IAPP immunoreactivity occurred in α, glucagon-containing, cells and did not co-localize with insulin in β cells. The islet tissues were devoid of amyloid deposits. IAPP DNA sequencing was performed to compare the sequence among teleost fish and the potency to form amyloid fibrils. In silico analysis of the amino acid sequences 19 - 34 revealed that it was not amyloidogenic. Conclusions: Amyloidosis of pancreatic islets would not be expected as a spontaneous disease in the Atlantic wolffish. Our study underlines that this teleost fish is a potential candidate for pancreatic xenograft research...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} the endoproteolytic {{activity}} involved in the post-translational processing of proinsulin has been investigated in rat insulinoma tissue. 125 I-proinsulin was converted by lysed insulin-secretory granules into insulin via an intermediate form identified as des-dibasic-proinsulin. This activity co-localized with <b>immunoreactive</b> (endogenous) <b>insulin</b> and carboxypeptidase H upon subcellular fractionation of the tissue, indicating a secretory-granular location. Under optimized conditions, conversion was quantitative. Inhibitor studies demonstrated that processing occurred by a reaction sequence involving cleavage on the C-terminal side of the pairs of basic amino acids, with subsequent removal of the newly exposed basic residues by carboxypeptidase H. Endoproteolytic activity was abolished by EDTA and CDTA (1, 2 -cyclohexanediaminetetra-acetic acid), but not by 1, 10 -phenanthroline or by group-specific inhibitors of serine, thiol or acidic proteinases. Inhibition by EDTA and CDTA could be reversed by both Ca 2 + and Zn 2 +, although the former {{appeared to be the}} ion of physiological importance. Addition of Ca 2 + in the absence of chelators stimulated endoproteinase activity, with a maximal effect at 5 mM, a concentration consistent with the intragranular environment. Similarly the pH optimum of 5. 5 coincides with the prevailing intragranular pH. Together these properties suggest that the Ca 2 +-dependent endopeptidase described here is involved in vivo in the proteolytic processing of proinsulin...|$|R
40|$|Plasma <b>immunoreactive</b> {{glucagon}} (IRG), <b>insulin</b> (IRI) {{and blood}} glucose (BG) were evaluated in the fasting state and during an arginine test (ATT) in 6 subjects with untreated hypopituitarism (H), in 2 hypopituitary subjects with normal cortisol production (H + C), in 3 subjects with Addison's disease (A) and in 14 normal volunteers (N). No increase in BG {{was observed in}} H and A after arginine, mean values being significantly lower than in N. Mean fasting and arginine-stimulated IRI levels were lower in H and A than in N; postabsorptive arginine-induced IRG levels were significantly reduced when compared to N. In contrast IRG levels in the two H + C patients were within the normal range. The impaired IRG production in A and in H (but not in H + C) suggests a close relationship between alpha pancreatic function and cortisol levels...|$|R
