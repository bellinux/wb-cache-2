25|$|Pitts enjoyed her {{greatest}} fame {{in the early}} 1930s, often starring in B movies and comedy short films, teamed with Thelma Todd. She played secondary parts in many films. Her stock persona (a fretful, flustered, worried spinster) made her instantly recognizable and was often imitated in cartoons and other films. She starred {{in a number of}} Hal Roach short films and features, and co-starred in a series of feature-length comedies with Slim Summerville. Switching between comedy short films and features, by the advent of sound, she was relegated to comedy roles. A bitter disappointment was when she was replaced in the classic war drama All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) by Beryl Mercer after her initial appearance in previews drew unintentional laughs, despite her intense performance. She had viewers rolling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> in Finn and Hattie (1931), The Guardsman (1931), Blondie of the Follies (1932), Sing and Like It (1934) and Ruggles of Red Gap (1935). In 1936 and 1937 she portrayed Hildegarde Withers in two movies, succeeding Edna May Oliver as the spinster sleuth, but they were not well received.|$|E

Furthermore, he remarked that the opening track, [...] "I Got My Brand on You", [...] "positively burns the relatively tame". Matthew Oshinsky, in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, praises the [...] "merciless refrain" [...] in [...] "Hoochie Coochie Man" [...] and the [...] "unvarnished moaning" [...] in [...] "Baby Please Don't Go". He also enjoys Muddy's powerful baritone, Cotton's harmonica playing, Spann's [...] "pub piano"–like playing and the overall danceable music.|$|E
500|$|Valentino played leading {{roles in}} {{fourteen}} films as a romantic figure. When {{he appeared in}} The Sheik in 1921, women fainted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> of theaters; the film grossed $1.5million. His second wife, Natacha Rambova, took increasing control of his career and image, although this meant his screen image turned [...] "increasingly effeminate". The films in which he played a romantic role within the action genre were the more successful at the box office; these included his final two works The Eagle (1925) and The Son of the Sheik (1926).
