50|$|The {{most common}} effects when taking <b>dapoxetine</b> are nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, headache, diarrhea, and insomnia. Discontinuation due to adverse effects is dose related. According to McMahon in recent study in Asia, {{the rate of}} {{discontinuation}} is 0.3%, 1.7%, and 5.3% of 1067 studied subjects with placebo, <b>dapoxetine</b> 30 mg, and <b>dapoxetine</b> 60 mg respectively. Unlike other SSRIs used to treat depression, which {{have been associated with}} high incidences of sexual dysfunction, <b>dapoxetine</b> is associated with low rates of sexual dysfunction. Taken as needed, <b>dapoxetine</b> has very mild adverse effects of decreased libido (<1%) and ED (<4%).|$|E
50|$|Originally {{created by}} Eli Lilly {{pharmaceutical}} company, <b>dapoxetine</b> {{was sold to}} Johnson & Johnson in 2003 and submitted as a New Drug Application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{for the treatment of}} PE in 2004. <b>Dapoxetine</b> is sold in several European and Asian countries, and in Mexico. In the US, <b>dapoxetine</b> has been in phase III development since 2003. However, it is expected to be marketed soon. In 2012, Menarini acquired the rights to commercialise <b>Dapoxetine</b> in Europe, most of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dapoxetine</b> is metabolized {{extensively}} in the liver and kidney by multiple enzymes such as CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and flavin monooxygenase 1 (FMO1). The major product {{at the end of}} the metabolic pathway is circulating <b>dapoxetine</b> N-oxide, which is a weak SSRI and contributes no clinical effect. The other products presented less than 3% in the plasma are desmethyldapoxetine and didesmethydapoxetine. Desmethyldapoxetine is approximately equipotent to <b>dapoxetine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many {{men that}} have PE also suffer from erectile {{dysfunction}} (ED). Treatment for these patients {{should consider the}} drug-drug interaction between <b>dapoxetine</b> and PDE5 inhibitors such as tadalafil (Cialis) or sildenafil (Viagra). In Dresser study (2006), plasma concentration of 24 subjects was obtained. Half of the sample pool were treated with <b>dapoxetine</b> 60 mg + tadalafil 20 mg; the other half were treated with <b>dapoxetine</b> 60 mg + sildenafil 100 mg. These plasma samples were then analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that <b>dapoxetine</b> does not alter the pharmacokinetic of tadalafil or sildenafil.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dapoxetine,</b> {{marketed as}} Priligy [...] and Westoxetin, among and other brands, {{is the first}} {{compound}} developed specially {{for the treatment of}} premature ejaculation (PE) in men 18-64 years old. <b>Dapoxetine</b> works by inhibiting the serotonin transporter, increasing serotonin's action at the post synaptic cleft, and as a consequence promoting ejaculatory delay. As a member of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) family, <b>dapoxetine</b> was initially created as an antidepressant. However, unlike other SSRIs, <b>dapoxetine</b> is absorbed and eliminated rapidly in the body. Its fast acting property makes it suitable for the treatment of PE but not as an antidepressant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dapoxetine</b> is a {{white powder}} {{substance}} and water- insoluble. Taken 1-3 hours before sexual activity, it is rapidly absorbed in the body. Its maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) is reached 1-2 hours after oral administration. The Cmax and AUC (Area Under the plasma vs. time Curve) are dose dependent. The Cmax and Tm (time needed to obtain the maximum plasma concentration) after single doses of <b>dapoxetine</b> 30 mg and 60 mg are 297 and 498 ng/mL at 1.01 and 1.27 hours respectively.A high fat meal does reduce the Cmax slightly, but it is insignificant. In fact, food doesn't alter <b>dapoxetine</b> pharmacokinetics. <b>Dapoxetine</b> can be taken with or without food.|$|E
50|$|The {{cardiovascular}} {{safety profile}} of <b>dapoxetine</b> {{has been studied}} extensively during the drug development. Phase I trials showed that <b>dapoxetine</b> had neither clinical significant electrocardiographic effects nor delayed repolarization effects, with dosing up to four-fold greater than the maximum recommended dosage which is 60 mg. Phase III studies in men with PE showed a safety and well tolerate profile of <b>dapoxetine</b> with dosing of 30 and 60 mg. There is no cardiovascular adverse had been found.|$|E
50|$|Randomized, double blind, {{placebo-controlled}} {{trials have}} confirmed {{the efficacy of}} <b>dapoxetine</b> {{for the treatment of}} PE. Different dosage has different impacts on different types of PE. <b>Dapoxetine</b> 60 mg significantly improves the mean intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) compared to that of <b>dapoxetine</b> 30 mg in men with lifelong PE, but there is no difference in men with acquired PE. <b>Dapoxetine,</b> given 1-3 hours before sexual episode, prolongs IELT and increases the sense of control and sexual satisfaction in men of 18 to 64 years of age with PE. Since PE is associated with personal distress and interrelationship difficulty, <b>dapoxetine</b> provides help for men with PE to overcome this condition.With no drup approved specifically for treatment for PE in the US and some other countries, other SSRIs such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, and citalopram have been used off-label to treat PE. Waldinger's meta-analysis shows that the use of these conventional antidepressants increases IELT two- to nine-fold above baseline, compared to three- to eight-fold when <b>dapoxetine</b> is used. However, these SSRIs must be taken daily in order to achieve meaningful efficacy, and the long half-life increases the risk of drug accumulation and as a consequence increase of adverse effects such as reduced libido and erectile dysfunction. <b>Dapoxetine,</b> on the other hand, is a fast-acting SSRI. It is rapidly absorbed and eliminated from the body within a few hours. This favorable pharmacokinetics minimizes the risk of the drug's accumulation in the body, and therefore reducing side effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dapoxetine</b> {{has been}} marketed and {{approved}} {{in more than}} 50 countries. <b>Dapoxetine</b> has been approved in Italy, Spain, Mexico, South Korea, and New Zealand in 2009 and 2010; marketed in Sweden, Austria, Germany, Finland, Spain, Portugal, and Italy. It has also been approved in France, Russia, Malaysia, Philippines, Argentina, and Uruguay.|$|E
50|$|Ethanol doesn't {{affect the}} {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>dapoxetine</b> when taking concurrently.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dapoxetine</b> {{is absorbed}} and {{distributed}} {{rapidly in the}} body. Greater than 99% of <b>dapoxetine</b> is bound to the plasma protein. The mean steady state volume is 162 L. Its initial half-life is 1.31 hours (30 mg dose) and 1.42 hours (60 mg dose,) and its terminal half life is 18.7 hours (30 mg dose) and 21.9 hours (60 mg dose).|$|E
50|$|ALZA is {{the current}} owner of <b>dapoxetine.</b> However, PPD will receive {{milestone}} payment and drug royalties from ALZA. If approved, <b>dapoxetine</b> will be marketed in the US by Ortho McNeil pharmaceutical, Inc. Ortho McNeil as well as Janssen-Ortho Inc, or Janssen-Cilag are all units of Johnson & Johnson.Dapoxetine is currently in phase III clinical trials, pending review by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA).|$|E
50|$|The {{incidence}} of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome symptoms in men using <b>dapoxetine</b> to treat premature ejaculation {{has been described}} by reviewers as low or no different from the {{incidence of}} such symptoms in men withdrawn from placebo treatment. The lack of chronic serotonergic stimulation with on-demand <b>dapoxetine</b> minimizes the potentiation action of serotonin at synaptic cleft, thus decreasing the risk of DESS.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{through which}} <b>dapoxetine</b> affects premature ejaculation is still unclear. However, it is presumed that <b>dapoxetine</b> works by inhibiting serotonin transporter and subsequently increasing serotonin's action at pre and postsynaptic receptors Human ejaculation is regulated by various {{areas in the}} central nervous system (CNS). The ejaculatory pathway originates from spinal reflex at the thoracolumbar and lumbosacral level of spinal cord activated by stimuli from male genital. These signals are relayed to the brain stem, which then is influenced by a number of nuclei in the brain such as medial preoptic and paraventricular nulcei. Clement's study performed on anaesthetized male rats showed that acute administration of <b>dapoxetine</b> inhibits ejaculatory expulsion reflex at supraspinal level by modulating activity of lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi) neurons. These effects cause an increase in pudendal motoneuron reflex discharge (PMRD) latency. However, it is unclear whether <b>dapoxetine</b> acts directly on LPGi or on the descending pathway in which LPGi located.|$|E
50|$|A {{contraindication}} is {{a situation}} in which a drug should not be used, because it may be harmful to the patient.Dapoxetine should not be used in men with moderate to severe hepatic impairment and in those receiving CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, and telithromycine. <b>Dapoxetine</b> can also not be used in patients with heart failure, permanent pacemaker, or other significant ischemic heart disease. Caution is advised in men receiving thioridazine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, SSRIs, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or tricyclic antidepressant. If a patient stops taking one of these drugs, he should wait for 14 days before taking <b>dapoxetine.</b> If a patient stops taking <b>dapoxetine,</b> he should wait for 7 days before receiving these drugs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dapoxetine</b> is {{sold under}} {{a variety of}} brand names {{including}} Dumax, Duratia, Kutub, Lejam, Pentenal-30, Priligy, Sustinex, and Westoxetin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dapoxetine</b> {{was created}} by Eli Lilly and in phase I {{clinical}} trial as an antidepressant. However, It never worked out well as a medication {{for the treatment of}} depression and was shelved for a while before subsequently developed to treat PE. In December 2003, Eli Lilly sold patent of <b>dapoxetine</b> to Pharmaceutical Product Development(PPD) for 65 million US dollars in cash. Eli Lilly may also receive royalties payment from PPD if the sale exceeds certain amount.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dapoxetine</b> is a short-acting SSRI {{which appears}} to work when taken as needed for PE. It is {{generally}} well tolerated. Tramadol, an atypical oral analgesic, appears to be effective.|$|E
50|$|Structurally related drugs include <b>dapoxetine,</b> duloxetine, edivoxetine, femoxetine, paroxetine, reboxetine, and viloxazine, all {{of which}} act, similarly, as monoamine reuptake inhibitors, and most of which are, again similarly, antidepressants.|$|E
50|$|The {{metabolites}} of <b>dapoxetine</b> {{are eliminated}} {{rapidly in the}} urine with a terminal half-life of 18.7 and 21.9 hours for a single dose of 30 mg and 60 mg respectively.|$|E
50|$|For {{those whose}} {{impotence}} {{is caused by}} medical conditions, prescription drugs such as Viagra, Cialis, and Levitra are available. However, doctors caution against the unnecessary use of these drugs because they are accompanied by serious risks such as increased chance of heart attack. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and antidepressant drug <b>dapoxetine</b> {{has been used to}} treat premature ejaculation. In clinical trials, those with PE who took <b>dapoxetine</b> experienced sexual intercourse three to four times longer before orgasm than without the drug. Another ejaculation-related disorder is delayed ejaculation, which can be caused as an unwanted side effect of antidepressant medications such as Fluvoxamine; however, all SSRIs have ejaculation-delaying effects, and Fluvoxamine has the least ejaculation-delaying effects.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous {{chemical}} substances influence the IELT. Substances such as alcohol and opioids (e.g. heroin, morphine, oxycodone) depress {{the central nervous}} system, prolonging the IELT, while selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g. <b>dapoxetine)</b> delay ejaculation by blocking a physiological process connected to ejaculatory inevitability, [...] "the male point of no return". For that reason, SSRIs can be prescribed to treat premature ejaculation.|$|E
50|$|Studies of SSRIs in {{patients}} with major psychiatric disorders prove that SSRIs are potentially associated with certain neurocognitive adverse effects such as anxiety, akathisia, hypomania, changes in mood, or suicidal thought. However, there is no study {{on the effects of}} SSRIs in men with PE. McMahon’s study in 2012 showed that <b>dapoxetine</b> has no effect on mood and is not associated with anxiety or suicidality.|$|E
50|$|Drugs that {{increase}} serotonin signalling {{in the brain}} slow ejaculation and have been used successfully to treat PE. These include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as paroxetine or <b>dapoxetine,</b> as well as clomipramine. Ejaculatory delay typically begins {{within a week of}} beginning medication. The treatments increase the ejaculatory delay to 6-20 times greater than before medication. Men often report satisfaction with treatment by medication, and many discontinue it within a year. However, SSRIs can cause various types of sexual dysfunction such as anorgasmia, erectile dysfunction, and diminished libido.|$|E

After postdoctoral studies at the University of Pennsylvania, he joined Eli Lilly in 1968.There, as well as his work with fluoxetine, Wong also helped discover atomoxetine, duloxetine and <b>dapoxetine.</b>|$|E
50|$|SRIs {{are used}} {{predominantly}} as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, and TCAs), {{though they are}} also commonly used {{in the treatment of}} other psychological conditions such as anxiety disorders and eating disorders. Less often, SRIs are also used to treat a variety of other medical conditions including neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia (e.g., duloxetine, milnacipran), and premature ejaculation (e.g., <b>dapoxetine)</b> as well as for dieting (e.g., sibutramine). Additionally, some clinically used drugs such as chlorpheniramine, dextromethorphan, and methadone possess SRI properties secondarily to their primary mechanism of action(s) and this contributes to their side effect and drug interaction profiles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{cardiovascular}} {{safety profile}} of <b>dapoxetine,</b> a novel selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) developed as an on-demand oral treatment for premature ejaculation (PE) in men, is evaluated.

Preclinical safety pharmacology studies did not suggest an adverse electro-physiologic or hemodynamic effect with concentrations of <b>dapoxetine</b> up to 2 -fold greater than recommended doses. Phase I clinical pharmacology studies demonstrated that <b>dapoxetine</b> did not prolong the QT/QTc interval and had neither clinically significant electrocardiographic effects nor evi-dence of delayed repolarization or conduction effects, with dosing up to 4 -fold greater than the maximum recommended dosage. Phase III clinical studies of <b>dapoxetine</b> in men with PE indicated that <b>dapoxetine</b> was generally safe and well tolerated with the dosing regimens used (30 mg and 60 mg as required). Events of syncope were reported during the clinical development program, with the majority occurring during study visits (on site) on day 1 fol-lowing administration of the first dose when various procedures (e. g. orthostatic maneuvers, venipunctures) were performed, suggesting that the procedures contributed to the incidence of syncope. This was consistent with previous re-ports showing that these and similar factors contribute to or trigger vasovagal syncope. Findings of the <b>dapoxetine</b> development program demonstrate that <b>dapoxetine</b> is associated with vasovagal-mediated (neurocardiogenic) syncope.

40|$|Introduction Premature {{ejaculation}} (PE) is {{a common}} male sexual disorder which is associated with substantial personal and interpersonal negative psychological factors. Pharmacotherapy of PE with off-label antidepressant SSRI drugs is common. Development and regulatory approval of drugs specifically {{for the treatment of}} PE will reduce reliance on off-label treatments and serve to fill a unmet treatment need. Aimml To review evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of <b>dapoxetine</b> in the treatment of PE. Methods MEDLINE and the proceedings of major international and regional scientific meetings during the period 1994 - 2010 were searched for publications or abstracts using the word <b>dapoxetine</b> in the title, abstract or keywords. This search was then manually cross-referenced for all papers. This review encompasses studies of <b>dapoxetine</b> pharmacokinetics, animal studies, human phase 1, 2 and 3 efficacy and safety studies and drug-interaction studies. Results <b>Dapoxetine</b> is a potent selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, which is administered on-demand 1 - 3 hours prior to planned sexual contact. <b>Dapoxetine</b> is rapidly absorbed and eliminated, resulting in minimal accumulation and has dose-proportional pharmacokinetics, which are unaffected by multiple dosing. <b>Dapoxetine</b> 30 mg and 60 mg has been evaluated in 5 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in 6081 men aged > 18 years. Outcome measures included stopwatch-measured intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), Premature Ejaculation Profile (PEP) inventory items, clinical global impression of change (CGIC) in PE, and adverse events. Mean IELT, all PEP items and CGIC improved significantly with both doses of <b>dapoxetine</b> vs. placebo (P < 0. 001 for all). The most common treatment related adverse effects included nausea (11. 0 % for 30 mg, 22. 2 % for 60 mg), dizziness (586 % for 30 mg, 10. 9 % for 60 mg), and headache (5. 6 % for 30 mg, 8. 8 % for 60 mg), and evaluation of validated rated scales demonstrated no SSRI class-related effects with <b>dapoxetine</b> use.
