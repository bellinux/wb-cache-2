50|$|In 1991, P. D. W. & A., Inc., an {{insolvent}} corporation taxed under Subchapter S, excluded its entire discharge of indebtedness amount from its gross income.

The scarce success of molecular-genetic studies to corroborate such population-genetic studies' conclusions is the missing heritability problem. Eric Turkheimer {{has argued that}} newer molecular methods have vindicated the conventional interpretation of twin studies, although it remains mostly unclear how to explain the relations between genes and behaviors. According to Turkheimer, both genes and environment are heritable, genetic contribution varies by environment, and a focus on heritability distracts from other important factors. [...] Overall, however, heritability is a concept widely applicable.|$|R
