This fluid, injected from the surface under high pressure, opens pre-existing joints in the basement rock, thus creating a man-made reservoir that may be as much as a cubic kilometer in size.

40|$|Abstract The {{formation}} of pyrite (FeS 2) from iron monosulfide precursors in anoxic sediments {{has been suggested}} to proceed via mackinawite (FeS) and greigite (Fe 3 S 4). Despite decades of research, the mechanisms of pyrite formation are not sufficiently understood because solid and dissolved intermediates are oxygen-sensitive and poorly crystalline and therefore notoriously difficult to characterize and quantify. In this study, <b>hydrothermal</b> synchrotron-based <b>energy</b> dispersive X-ray diffraction (ED-XRD) methods were used to investigate in situ and in real-time the trans{{formation of}} mackinawite to greigite and pyrite via the polysulfide pathway. The rate of formation and disappearance of specific Bragg peaks during the reaction and the changes in morphology of the solid phases as observed with high resolution microscopy were used to derive kinetic parameters and to determine the mechanisms of the reaction from mackinawite to greigite and pyrite. The results clearly show that greigite is formed as an intermediate on the pathway from mackinawite to pyrite. The kinetics of the transformation of mackinawite to greigite and pyrite follow a zero-order rate law indicating a solid-state mechanism. The morphology of greigite and pyrite crystals formed under hydrothermal conditions supports this conclusion and furthermore implies growth of greigite and pyrite by oriented aggregation of nanoparticulate mackinawite and greigite, respectively. The activation enthalpies and entropies of the transformation of mackinawite to greigite, and of greigite to pyrite were determined from the temperature dependence of the rate constants according to the Eyring equation. Although the activation enthalpies are uncharacteristic of a solid-state mechanism, the activation entropies indicate a large increase of order in the transition state, commensurate with a solid-state mechanism. </p...|$|R

This implies that some reduction of the CO 2 flux to the atmosphere may be possible, but we cannot quantify this. Additionally, this CO 2 flux is a maximum estimate as the model assumes that the magma is instantaneously emplaced at a certain depth, and this determines the resulting composition and fluid volume fractions; the model does not simulate the exsolution of CO 2 as the magma migrates from depth to the storage zone prior to the eruption.

In nature, primary migration of hydrocarbons, i. e. generation {{of oil and gas}} from tight source rock and its expulsion to more permeable reservoirs, is driven by formation of microfractures in the heated organic-rich shale. The tomographic 3 D imaging of the rocks samples during heating showed that micro-cracks develop in the shale due to internal pore pressure build-up. Generation of hydrocarbons drives fracture formation until a drainage network sufficient for expulsion is developed. Experiments were also conducted on analogue material, where gelatine was fractured during fermentation of yeast and sugar. Studies of the gel confined in Hele-Shaw cell showed that CO 2 generation leads to formation of a drainage network which topology re{{presents a}} new class of networks, intermediate between hierarchical fracture pattern and river network.

Numerical models of heat and fluid flow are applied to illustrate {{the important role of}} fault zone properties (permeability and width) in controlling mass accumulation at hydrothermal vents at slow spreading ridges.

Model runs with increased basal heat input, mimicking a heat flow contribution from along-axis, lead to higher mass fluxes and vent temperatures, capable of significantly higher SMS accumulation rates. Nonsteady state conditions, such as the influence of a cooling magmatic intrusion beneath the fault zone, also can temporarily increase the mass flux while sustaining high vent temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The aim and {{objectives}} of this work are to synthesize cobalt-based hydroxides and transition metal disulphides composites with carbon materials such as graphene foam and activated carbon by a facile and environmentally friendly <b>hydrothermal</b> technique for <b>energy</b> storage application. Because faradaic materials suffer from poor electrical conductivity and low electrochemical stability, while carbon materials {{are known to have}} good electrical conductivity and electrochemical stability, the combination of the two materials to make hybrid material should be able to improve the electrochemical properties of the composite material. Morphological, structural, surface area and compositions properties of the produced materials were evaluated and characterized using methods such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm (BET), Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. Electrochemical characterization involved cycling voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cycling life were carried out in two (asymmetric device) and three-electrode configurations using 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte and they all showed excellent electrochemical performance. For instance the asymmetric devices based on CoA-LDH/graphene foam//AEG gave specific capacitance of 101. 4 F g- 1 with a maximum energy density of 28 Wh kg- 1 and a corresponding power density of 1420 W kg- 1 at a current density of 0. 5 A g- 1, VS 2 //AC gave specific capacity of 155 F g- 1 and high energy and power densities of 42 Wh kg- 1 and 700 W kg- 1 respectively at current density of 1 A g- 1. and MoS 2 _ 150 mg GF //AEG gave high specific capacitance of 59 F g- 1 with maximum energy and power densities of 16 Wh kg- 1 and 758 W kg- 1 respectively at a current density of 1 A g- 1 respectively. All these results showed the great potential of the hybrid materials derived from the incorporation of cobalt based hydroxides and transition metal disulphides with carbon for supercapacitor application.
