"By this time, {{my dearest}} sister, you have {{received}} my hurried letter; I wish {{this may be}} more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs. F. gave them {{to understand that they}} were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure I know not; but his <b>excessive</b> <b>distress</b> will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness." ...|$|E

40|$|Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is a {{body image}} {{disorder}} characterised by a preoccupation with a slight or imagined defect in one’s appearance, leading to <b>excessive</b> <b>distress</b> or functional impairment in social, occupational and/or other important areas of life. Previous research and theory have implicated the role of selective attention {{in the development and}} maintenance of the disorder, most notably in Veale’s cognitive-behavioural model (Veale, 2004, Veale et al., 1996). The current study explores {{the nature and extent of}} selective attentional biases toward BDD-related threat stimuli, by investigating (a) whether an attentional bias to BDD-related threat exists, and (b) whether such a bias, if found, stems from a process of facilitated attention toward threat or from difficulties in disengaging attention away from threat. To investigate these focal research questions, a modified version of the Posner paradigm (Posner, 1980) was utilised to test an analogue undergraduate student population categorised as either ‘high dysmorphic concern’ or ‘low dysmorphic concern’. Participants completed a computer task in which words classified as ‘BBD-threat’, ‘BDDpositive’ or ‘neutral’ were presented as a cue to one of two locations on the screen. Participants then detected the location of a probe that appeared in either the same position as the preceding cue word (valid cue) or in the opposite location (invalid cue). It was hypothesised that the high dysmorphic concern group would show significantly slower response times for invalidly cued probes compared with the low dysmorphic concern group, but only in the ‘BDD-threat’ condition, thereby showing support for the disengagement difficulties perspective. The study’s hypotheses were partially supported. Implications for future research and practice are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Attention to {{physician}} wellness {{has increased}} as medical practice gains in complexity. Physician satisfaction with practice {{is critical for}} quality of care and practice growth. The {{purpose of this study}} was to model physicians’ self-reported Satisfaction with Competence as a function of their perceptions of the Quality of Health Services, Distress, Coping, Practice Management, Personal Satisfaction and Professional Equity. Methods: Comprehensive questionnaires were sent to a stratified sample of 5300 physicians across Canada. This cross-sectional study focused on physicians who examined and treated individual patients for a final study population of 2639 physicians. Response bias was negligible. The questionnaires contained measures of Satisfaction with Competence, Quality of Health Services, Distress, Coping, Personal Satisfaction, Practice Management and Professional Equity. Exploring relationships was done using Pearson correlations and one-way analysis of variance. Modeling was by hierarchical regressions. Results: The measures were reliable: Satisfaction with Competence (α[*]=[*]. 86), Quality (α[*]=[*]. 86), Access (α[*]=[*]. 82), Distress (α[*]=[*]. 82), Coping (α[*]=[*]. 76), Personal Satisfaction (α[*]=[*]. 78), Practice Management (α[*]=[*]. 89) and the dimensions of Professional Equity (Fulfillment, α[*]=[*]. 81; Financial, α[*]=[*]. 93; and Recognition, α[*]=[*]. 75) with comparative validity. Satisfaction with Competence was positively correlated with Quality (r[*]=[*]. 32), Efficiency (r[*]=[*]. 37) and Access (r[*]=[*]. 32); negatively correlated with Distress (r[*]=[*]−. 54); and positively correlated with Coping strategies (r[*]=[*]. 43), Personal Satisfaction (r[*]=[*]. 57), Practice Management (r[*]=[*]. 17), Fulfillment (r[*]=[*]. 53), Financial (r[*]=[*]. 36) and Recognition (r[*]=[*]. 54). Physicians’ perceptions on Quality, Efficiency, Access, Distress, Coping, Personal Satisfaction, Practice Management, Fulfillment, Pay and Recognition explained 60. 2 % of the variation in Satisfaction with Competence, controlling for years in practice, self-reported health and duties of physicians. Conclusion: Satisfaction with Competence could be affected by excessive accumulation of duties, concerns about quality, efficiency, access, <b>excessive</b> <b>distress,</b> inadequate coping abilities, personal satisfaction with life as a physician, challenges in managing practices and persistent inequities among physicians...|$|E

30|$|However, the drop-jump {{protocol}} did induce medium {{increases in}} absolute cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic demands during the steady-state running economy test preceding the time trials, thereby indicating {{an increase in}} relative exercise intensity (for details, see preceding companion article) [7]. Running with mild EIMD therefore elicited a stressful physiological milieu that is not conducive to high-performance. In support, in the current study, differential responses in haematological indicators of EIMD predicted non-adaptive endocrinological distress response, which in turn predicted increased performance fatigability. Thus, the escalating leg-related and generalised fatigue experienced when HTW [2] are likely associated with greater accumulation of EIMD, amplified physiological demands, and <b>excessive</b> endocrinological <b>distress</b> response during the second-half of marathons compared to half-marathons [32]. This notion is consistent with observational data showing correlations between greater decreases in marathon running pace after ≈[*] 25  km and haematological markers of muscle damage in moderately trained runners who slowed down significantly more {{than those who were}} able to maintain their running speed [9].|$|R
40|$|Rural intersections {{originally}} {{constructed with}} thin untreated flexible base and hot mix or a two-course surface treatment tend to experience severe pushing, shoving and rutting. These failures cause an extremely rough surface {{that can cause}} damage to small vehicles and potentially cause motorists to lose control of their vehicles. These distresses almost always result in complete failure of the existing pavement that must be repaired {{several times during the}} life of the roadway by maintenance forces. In most cases, pavements constructed with the same materials and cross-sections adjacent to the intersection perform adequately. ^ The sources of and solutions for failure of the intersections in urban areas are well researched and a number of solutions (such as full-depth concrete slabs, white topping, high quality hot mix asphalt) have been implemented. Little attention has been focused toward the rural low-volume road intersections in the US. A vast body of knowledge is available from work done in other countries (e. g., Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand) where the majority of their highway networks are either unpaved or are covered with thin surface treatment. The primary motivation for reconstruction or rehabilitation of the urban high-volume intersections is the speed of the operation to minimize the road closure, and the economy of the solution is of the secondary consideration. However, to develop implementable solutions for the rural intersections, the economy of the solution plays a primary role. The primary goal of this project is to provide solutions that can be readily and economically carried out considering the location of the project, the construction practices, and the type of potential or actual damage at the intersections. ^ Since the sources of <b>excessive</b> <b>distresses</b> at the intersections and their possible solutions are diverse, an easy-to-use excel program is proposed to incorporate the knowledge gained. The program will provide step-by-step guidance on the process of identifying the source of the problem, and selecting the best cost-effective alternative to mitigate the problem. The body of evidence from other countries with vast network of low-volume roads indicates that the most economical and effective solutions are those that strengthen the shallow subgrade or base instead of adding layers of hot mix or concrete. ...|$|R

50|$|Separation {{anxiety is}} common for infants {{between the ages of}} eight and {{fourteen}} months and occurs as infants begin to understand their own selfhood—or understand that they are separate persons from their primary caregiver. Infants oftentimes look for their caregivers to give them a sense of comfort and familiarity, which causes separation to become challenging. Subsequently, the concept of object permanence emerges—which is when children learn that something still exists when it cannot be seen or heard, thus increasing their awareness of being separated from their caregiver. Consequently, during the developmental period where an infant’s sense self, incorporating object permanence as well, the child also begins to understand that they can in fact be separated from their primary caregiver. They see this separation as something final though, and don’t yet understand that their caregiver will return causing fear and distress for the infant. It is when an individual (infant, child, or otherwise) consistently reacts to separation with <b>excessive</b> anxiety and <b>distress</b> and experiences a great deal of interference from their anxiety that a diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder (SAD) can be warranted.|$|R
40|$|Background & objectives: Though {{studies have}} {{reported}} high prevalence rates of metabolic syndrome among patients with bipolar disorder (BPAD) and schizophrenia, there is lack of data {{on the impact of}} the same on the patients' life. This study was aimed to assess the lifestyle related factors associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and to study the impact of MetS on functioning and quality of life (QOL) in patients with BPAD and schizophrenia. Methods: A total of 102 patients with BPAD and 72 patients with schizophrenia attending the output unit of a tertiary care hospital in north India were evaluated for MetS. These patients were assessed on Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile scale II (HPLP II), World Health Organization QOL -Bref Version (WHOQOL-Bref), Impact of Weight on Quality of Life- Lite version (IWOQOL -Lite), Body weight, Image and Self-esteem Evaluation questionnaire (BWISE), Obesity-related Problem scale (OP scale) and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale. Results: MetS was associated with lower scores on domains of health responsibility and nutrition habit domain on HPLP-II scale in both groups, and additionally on physical activity and stress management domain in BPAD group. On WHOQOL-Bref, MetS was associated with lower scores on the domains of physical and psychological health in both groups. On IWQOL–Lite, scores on personal distress and self esteem domains were higher in those with obesity in both groups and also on physical activity domain in schizophrenia group. Those with MetS had lower level of functioning as measured by GAF in schizophrenia group. Fulfillment of higher number of criteria of MetS correlated with poorer quality of life and higher problems in both groups. Interpretation & conclusions: Many modifiable lifestyle factors increase the risk of MetS. MetS was found to be associated with poorer QOL in patients with BPAD and schizophrenia; in addition, obesity led to poor self-esteem and <b>excessive</b> personal <b>distress...</b>|$|R

40|$|Women with {{posttraumatic}} stress disorder (PTSD) often develop alcohol use disorders (AUD) resulting {{from the use of}} alcohol to self-medicate from negative affect. Research supports the relationship between comorbid PTSD and AUD, and studies with women additionally identify the role of rumination, or <b>excessive</b> thinking about <b>distress</b> and its causes, as a precipitating aspect leading to self-medication. Female-based data is sparse, however, regarding specific thought patterns and factors which trigger the need to self-medicate with alcohol. Numerous researchers have studied the relationship between stress, anxiety, and alcohol use, although, there exists a need for qualitative studies providing thick, rich information. Applying the self-medication model and rumination theory, {{the purpose of this study}} was to use a transcendental research framework as a lens to explore and describe the phenomenon of how women with comorbid PTSD and AUD make sense of their dual disorder. Qualitative data were gathered from in-depth interviews of 12 women who participated in Alcoholics Anonymous groups in a large Southeastern city. The women collectively described their lived experience with the phenomenon as an internally-focused strategy premised on the notion of a â??Higher Power. â?? They reported using this strategy to manage thoughts, feelings, and behaviors which triggered negative self-assessment and the need to self-medicate with alcohol. This research contributes to the literature by offering a more detailed understanding of comorbid PTSD and AUD.

40|$|The {{tendency}} to worry is a facet of neuroticism {{that has been}} shown to mediate the relationship between neuroticism and symptoms of depression and anxiety. The aim of the current study was to investigate the neural correlates of state worry in association with neuroticism. One-hundred twenty participants were selected from an initially recruited sample of 240 women based on their neuroticism score. First, participants completed a questionnaire to assess the excessiveness and uncontrollability of pathological worry. Second, we measured brain activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants were randomly presented with 12 worry-inducing sentences and 12 neutral sentences in a mood induction paradigm. Individuals scoring higher on neuroticism reported to worry more in daily life and to have generated more worry-related thoughts after the presentation of a worry-inducing sentence. Furthermore, imaging results showed the involvement of default mode and emotional brain areas during worry, previously associated with self-related processing and emotion regulation. Specifically, cortical midline structures and the anterior insula showed more activation during worry, when individuals indicated to have generated more worry-related thoughts. Activation in the retrosplenial and visual cortex was decreased in individuals scoring higher on neuroticism during worry, possibly suggesting reduced autobiographical specificity and visual mental imagery. In the literature, both these processes have been related to the cognitive avoidance of emotional <b>distress.</b> <b>Excessive</b> worry features in a number of emotional disorders and results from studies that elucidate its neural basis may help explain how and why neuroticism contributes to vulnerability for psychopathology.
