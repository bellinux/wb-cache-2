40|$|A longstanding {{goal for}} ecologists is to {{understand}} the processes that maintain biological diversity in communities, yet few studies have investigated the combined effects of predators and resources on biodiversity in natural ecosystems. We fertilized nutrient limited plots and excluded insectivorous birds in a randomized block design, and examined the impacts on arthropods associated with the dominant tree in the Hawaiian Islands, Metrosideros polymorpha (Myrtaceae). After 33 mo, the species load (per foliage mass) of herbivores and carnivores increased with fertilization, but rarified richness (standardized to abundance) did not change. Fertilization depressed species richness of arboreal detritivores, and carnivore richness <b>dropped</b> in <b>caged,</b> unfertilized plots, both because of the increased dominance of common, introduced species with treatments. Herbivore species abundance distributions were more equitable than other trophic levels following treatments, and fertilization added specialized native species without changing relativized species richness. Overall, bird removal and nutrient addition treatments on arthropod richness acted largely independently, but with countervailing influences that obscured distinct top-down and bottom-up effects on different trophic levels. This study demonstrates that species composition, biological invasions, and the individuality of species traits may complicate efforts to predict {{the interactive effects of}} resources and predation on species diversity in food webs...|$|R

The procedures investigated were: (1) A compound disinfectant consisting of a mixture of formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and quarternary ammonium applied at the recommended concentration; (2) Formalin 10 % (vol/vol) of the standard 37 % commercial dilution applied by a contractor; (3) Other disinfection procedures selected and applied by the farmer. The recovery of Salmonella in the cleaned and disinfected houses was variable, with samples from floor and <b>dropping</b> boards/belts (<b>cage</b> houses) and scratching areas (non-cage houses) being the most likely to remain contaminated. In cage houses, the use of formalin 10 % led to a statistically greater reduction in the sample prevalence than using any of the other cleaning and disinfection method. A negative post-C&D result predicted clearance of Salmonella in 52 % cases, although the isolation of Salmonella from the houses immediately after C&D was not a perfect predictor of carry-over of infection...|$|R

5000|$|Arcade {{appears as}} a boss in Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, voiced by Quinton Flynn. He {{is a member of}} Doctor Doom's Masters of Evil. Here, Arcade and Baron Mordo divert the heroes from their attempt to attack Dr. Doom's castle to rescue the X-Men Nightcrawler and Jean Grey. Mordo uses his magic to disrupt Doctor Strange's Orb of Teleportation and send the heroes to Murderworld instead of Castle Doom. Although the first area is a replica of Castle Doom, players can tell {{something}} is wrong by a few minor details (such as the carnival-like music playing, treasure chests with mallets that pop out, skeletons with clown noses, broken pillars revealing striped poles, and portraits of Dr. Doom wearing Arcade-like wigs, even though Arcade appears blond instead of redheaded in his in-game portraits). Besides having the normal Murderworld traps, Arcade also has Shocker and Rhino working for him, uses mind control to force Jean Grey to attack the heroes, captures Blade and Senator Kelly, and finally attacks the heroes himself in a giant robot called the Arcade-Bot. After beating Arcade, he tells the player that Dr. Doom has Nightcrawler, and has taken him to Mephisto's Realm. His fate is unknown after that. Arcade was also the villain on Deadpool's simulator disc, where he is irritated greatly by Deadpool's refusal to accept that Murderworld isn't a normal theme park (although this probably is Deadpool's taunting rather than an actual lack of understanding, Deadpool's borderline insanity makes this uncertain), and forcing the mercenary to fight Dark Spider-Man (who Arcade referred to as his creation). He is also the villain in Black Panther's disc, threatening T'Challa to give the secret codes to Wakanda's vibranium facility (which of course he doesn't tell) and forcing Black Panther to fight Dark Captain America. Storm's disc where she fights Hussar and the versus Mysterio simulator take place in Murderworld as does Mr. Fantastic's in his fight against Bulldozer.

40|$|In vitro and in vivo {{studies on}} the {{degradation}} of 70 / 30 poly(L,DL-lactide) (PLDLLA) cages. To evaluate the effect of e-beam and ethylene oxide sterilization on degradation and strength. e-beam-sterilized PLDLLA cages were shown to maintain mechanical strength for at least 6 months during degradation studies in vitro. Yet failure of the cages was observed after only 3 months in vivo. We hypothesized that degradation characteristics and mechanical strength could be improved by sterilizing the cages through ethylene oxide (EtO) instead of e-beam. PLDLLA cages were sterilized either by e-beam or EtO, and degraded in phosphate-buffered saline. Each month, cages were compressed until failure. Inherent viscosity was determined as a measure of degradation. For the in vivo evaluation, e-beam- or EtO-sterilized cages were implanted at L 3 -L 4 in a standardized goat model. After 3 or 6 months, retrieved segments were scanned by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Also, inherent viscosity of the polymer was measured. e-beam sterilization strongly decreased inherent viscosity of PLDLLA compared with EtO sterilization, but initial strength was only affected marginally. After 6 months, the strength of the e-beam-sterilized <b>cages</b> <b>dropped,</b> while that of EtO-sterilized cages was maintained. Degradation in vivo was slightly faster than in vitro. In both groups, however, mechanical failure occurred at 3 months after implantation. Inherent viscosity decreases with degradation time, but strength only decreases when inherent viscosity is below a certain threshold. Above this threshold, mechanical strength is a property of the polymer and independent of inherent viscosity. e-beam sterilization strongly decreases inherent viscosity and thus advances mechanical degradation. EtO sterilization delays degradation but does not increase initial strength. Early failure of PLDLLA cages in the goat model thus is unrelated to sterilization method and requires further stud...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the trial}} in October and November 1981 of Taub and Kunz, Taub told the court—as {{reported}} by The Baltimore Sun—that the monkeys had been given [...] "gentle" [...] treatment, and had {{what he called a}} [...] "remarkable record of health." [...] He acknowledged that they had not been seen by a veterinarian in the previous two years, because he was an expert himself in the treatment of deafferented monkeys. Responding to the images of the monkeys with open sores and decaying bandages, he said that using salves, ointments, and bandages is more dangerous than leaving the conditions untreated; monkeys feel no pain from the deafferented limbs and learn to ignore them, he said, whereas drawing attention to the wounds with salves or bandages would cause the animals to bite or claw at them. Bandages might be necessary where the wounds had grown out of control, or where there was massive infection, and it was sometimes better to let the bandages deteriorate, he said. Taub also testified that some of the photographs Pacheco took had been staged for dramatic effect. Norman Doidge wrote in 2007 that, according to Taub, the monkeys in the photographs had been placed in positions that were not part of the laboratory procedure, a claim Pacheco denied. As for the dirt, Taub said [...] "monkey rooms are dirty places," [...] and that it was normal in laboratories for fecal matter to lie on the floor and food to <b>drop</b> through the <b>cage</b> bottoms into waste trays. He said employees had used brooms and mops on the floor, and had emptied the waste trays nearly every day. He said the monkeys had been given fresh fruit twice a week, and that he disagreed with the veterinarians who testified for the prosecution that the female monkey, Sarah, was underweight.|$|R
50|$|Before the European Title match, a cage {{was lowered}} {{from the ceiling}} and after both {{competitors}} came to the ring, Commissioner Slaughter came to ringside to oversee Chyna being caged. Once she was locked in, but with Triple H still paying attention to her, Owen Hart attacked Triple H from behind and fought him up the ramp and back down, throwing him into the cage and then suplexing him on the walkway, taunting him with an ironic crotch chop before rolling him into the ring for the match to be officially started. They {{were not in the}} ring long though, as Hart immediately clotheslined the champion out again, and watched Chyna's cage ascend. Triple H eventually managed to fight back after much dominance from Hart, using a flying knee while Hart was running. He slowed down the match after a suplex with an inverted backbreaking sleeper hold and despite some fight back from Hart, Triple H mostly managed to keep subdue him with a variety of holds. Hart reversed the second time Helmsley applied the backbreaker sleeper by bridging into a standing position and then performing a backflip to allow a belly to back suplex. It was at this point that Chyna's attempts to break free from the cage, that had been going on all match, came to fruition with the steel bars bending under her hold. While Hart continued to throw Triple H around, Chyna gradually climbed out of the cage but was too far to <b>drop</b> down. The <b>cage</b> suddenly lowered, revealed to be Road Dogg at the controls, allowing her to drop off and jump to the apron causing Hart {{to let go of the}} Sharpshooter hold on Helmsley in order to push her to the ground.

During {{the fall of}} 2010, Los Psycho Circus were engulfed in a war with the many variations of Los Perros del Mal, with Damián 666, Halloween and the group's leader El Hijo del Perro Aguayo being the most prominent Perros during the feud. After several matches {{between the two groups}} went to either a no contest or a countout, they were booked to face each other on December 5 at Guerra de Titanes in a steel cage weapons match, where Los Perros del Mal was represented by Damián 666, Halloween and X-Fly. In the end of the match, Halloween and Murder Clown were left in the cage, when someone wearing a Monster Clown mask ran out, climbed up the cage and prevented Murder Clown from escaping the <b>cage,</b> <b>dropping</b> him down to the mat and allowing Halloween to escape the cage, handing Los Psycho Circus their first ever loss. After the match, the man unmasked himself to reveal El Hijo del Perro Aguayo, who had been sidelined in October with a knee injury with reports stating {{that he would have to}} stay out of the ring for the rest of the year. The feud between the two groups continued at March's Rey de Reyes, where Los Perros del Mal, represented by Aguayo, Damián 666, Halloween and Super Crazy, was once again victorious in a match against Los Psycho Circus and Dr. Wagner Jr., the alliance known as Potencia Mundial ("World Power"). The feud also spread out to independent promotions International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) and Perros del Mal Producciones (PdM); in IWRG, the groups feuded over the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship, which Los Psycho Circus successfully defended against Los Perros, while in PdM, the two groups faced each other in a Masks vs. Hairs steel cage match, which ended with Super Crazy having his hair head shaved off. In May 2011, AAA announced that the promotion was going to crown their first ever World Trios Champions and started a tournament with the finals being held at Triplemanía XIX. Los Psycho Circus advanced to the finals by defeating La Maniarquía (Chessman, Silver King and Último Gladiador) and The Black Family (Dark Cuervo, Dark Espíritu and Dark Ozz), while Los Perros del Mal advanced by defeating Real Fuerza Aérea (Aero Star, Argenis and Laredo Kid) and Los Bizarros (Charly Manson, Cibernético and Escoria) to set up a grudge match for the AAA World Trios Championship at Triplemanía XIX.|$|R

The match was contested under escape rules, with all eight participants starting inside the cage and after only one is left inside, that person will then wrestle his partner in a Lucha de Apuestas. Psicosis allowed Halloween to {{climb to the top}} of the cage, believing that he was going to dive back in onto his opponents, but instead Halloween betrayed his Perros del Mal stablemate and became the first man to escape the cage. Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans, former AAA World Tag Team Champions, worked together against Psicosis and Teddy Hart, the other two Perros del Mal members in the match, but were then attacked by Juventud Guerrera, swinging a garbage can. Guerrera then became the second man to escape the cage and was followed shortly afterwards by Tiger, who dove from the top of the cage outside onto Halloween and Guerrera. This meant that the former La Familia de Tijuana was the first team to successfully avoid the Lucha de Apuesta. This was followed by Psicosis turning on and attacking Líder, who had publicly announced prior to the event that he hoped to lose the Parejas Suicidas match to get a shot at Psicosis' hair, before escaping the cage. Evans was the next to escape the cage, after avoiding Teddy Hart's attempts to stop him. Hart then climbed on top of the cage and dove onto Chessman and Líder with a moonsault, before climbing back up and escaping, saving himself and Evans from a Hair vs. Hair match and leaving only Chessman and Líder inside. Psicosis, realizing he was in danger of being forced to a Hair vs. Hair match, climbed up the cage and put his hand out to Líder, offering to help him up. Líder grabbed the hand and started to climb, but was dropped to the mat following a kick from Chessman, who then climbed {{to the top of the}} opposite side of the cage to become the last escapee, meaning that the former La Hermandad 187 partners were forced to a Lucha de Apustas later in the event. As Chessman celebrated at the top of the cage, the lights in the arena suddenly went out, leading to Vampiro making a surprise appearance and pushing his rival down from the top of the <b>cage,</b> <b>dropping</b> him through a set of tables on the floor of the Arena Ciudad de México.

50|$|Since their {{formation}} in December 2007, Los Psycho Circus (Monster Clown, Murder Clown and Psycho Clown) had not lost a single match, with AAA claiming that their win streak had reached over 600 victories. During {{the fall of}} 2010, Los Psycho Circus were engulfed in a war with the many variations of Los Perros del Mal, with Damián 666, Halloween and the groups leader El Hijo del Perro Aguayo being the most prominent Perros during the feud. After several matches {{between the two groups}} went to either a no contest or a countout, they were booked to face each other on December 5 at Guerra de Titanes in a steel cage weapons match, where Los Perros del Mal was represented by Damián 666, Halloween and X-Fly. In the end of the match, Halloween and Murder Clown were left in the cage, when someone wearing a Monster Clown mask ran out, climbed up the cage and prevented Murder Clown from escaping the <b>cage,</b> <b>dropping</b> him down to the mat and allowing Halloween to escape the cage, handing Los Psycho Circus their first ever loss. After the match, the man unmasked himself to reveal El Hijo del Perro Aguayo, who had been sidelined in October with a knee injury with reports stating {{that he would have to}} stay out of the ring for the rest of the year. The feud between the two groups continued at Marchs Rey de Reyes, where Los Perros del Mal, represented by Aguayo, Damián 666, Halloween and Super Crazy, was once again victorious in a match against Los Psycho Circus and Dr. Wagner Jr., the alliance known as Potencia Mundial ("World Power"). The feud also spread out to independent promotions International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) and Perros del Mal Producciones (PdM); in IWRG, the groups feuded over the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship, which Los Psycho Circus successfully defended against Los Perros, while in PdM, the two groups faced each other in a Masks vs. Hairs steel cage match, which ended with Super Crazy having his hair head shaved off. In May 2011, AAA announced that the promotion was going to crown their first ever World Trios Champions and started a tournament with the finals being held at Triplemanía XIX. Los Psycho Circus advanced to the finals by defeating La Maniarquía (Chessman, Silver King and Último Gladiador) and The Black Family (Dark Cuervo, Dark Espíritu and Dark Ozz), while Los Perros del Mal advanced by defeating Real Fuerza Aérea (Aero Star, Argenis and Laredo Kid) and Los Bizarros (Charly Manson, Cibernético and Escoria) to set up a grudge match for the AAA World Trios Championship at Triplemanía XIX.|$|R
