For an 8 mu m diameter sphere suspended in water, the higher-order modes produce an axial trapping force several {{times larger than}} that of the fundamental. Partial absorption results in a transfer of the orbital angular momentum from the Laguerre-Gaussian mode to the trapped particle. This results in the rotation of the particle by what may be called an optical <b>spanner</b> (<b>wrench).</b> For an absorption coefficient of alpha = 5700 m(- 1) and a laser power of 10 mW, we find that an 8 mu m diameter sphere would acquire an angular acceleration of 10 x 10 (4) rad s(- 2) and a limiting angular velocity of 0. 2 rad s(- 1) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. —Tackle {{manufacturers}} {{have responded to}} concerns regarding hooking injury and mor-tality by attempting to design and market hooks that are less damaging to fish (e. g., circle hooks). To date, studies investigating circle hooks have been primarily restricted to large marine species. We compared the injury and short-term (72 -h) mortality of bluegills Lepomis macrochirus and pumpkinseeds L. gibbosus angled using number- 6 circle hooks and three other conventional <b>hook</b> <b>types</b> (aberdeen, wide-gap, and baitholder) across three water temperatures (18, 22, and 268 C). Unlike other <b>hook</b> <b>types,</b> circle <b>hooks</b> were never lodged in the gullet, but they were frequently lodged in the eye. Some fish captured on conventional hooks were hooked deeply in the gullet, necessitating line cutting for release. Incidences of bleeding were low using all <b>hook</b> <b>types,</b> and when not lodged in the gullet, all hooks were generally easy to remove. Anatomical hooking locations differed among small (, 145 -mm) and large (. 145 -mm) bluegills for all <b>hook</b> <b>types</b> but not among pumpkinseeds. Hooking depth differed between small and large fish of both species captured on circle hooks; smaller fish were hooked more deeply. Mortality in both species wa...|$|R

25|$|The upper {{segment of}} the grooved wheel, made of {{hardened}} steel, projects through a slot cut to its precise dimensions {{in the base of}} the priming pan. The wheel is grooved on its outside circumference with three or more V-shaped grooves with transverse cuts at intervals to provide a friction surface for the iron pyrites. The wheel is fixed to a shaft, one end of which projects outside the lockplate. The outside projection is of square section to permit a <b>spanner</b> (<b>wrench)</b> to be engaged for subsequent tensioning of the lock. The other end of the shaft fits {{through a hole in the}} lockplate, and on this end is forged a cam, or eccentric. One end of a short, robust chain (made of three or four flat, parallel links like a short piece of bicycle chain) is fixed to the cam, while the other end of the chain is held in a groove at the end of the longer branch of a large heavy V-spring, which is generally retained by a screw and a headed bracket through upstands inside the lockplate.|$|R

Whitworth (spanner) markings refer to the bolt diameter rather than the distance across the flats of the hexagon (A/F) as in other standards. Confusion also arises because BSF hexagon sizes can be one size smaller than the corresponding Whitworth hexagon. This leads to instances where a <b>spanner</b> (<b>wrench)</b> marked 7/16BSF is the same size as one marked 3/8W. In both cases the spanner jaw width of 0.710 in, the width across the hexagon flat, is the same. However, in World War II the size of the Whitworth hexagon was reduced to {{the same size as the}} equivalent BSF hexagon purely to save metal during the war and they never went back to the old sizes afterwards. Thus it is today uncommon to encounter a Whitworth hexagon which takes the nominally correct spanner. Spanners in this case may be marked 7/16BS to indicate that they have a jaw size of 0.710 in and are designed to take either the (later) 7/16 BSW or 7/16 BSF hexagon.|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} {{numbers of}} strikes, proportions of fish that hooked up after strikes, proportions of fish that stayed on hook (retained) after hook up, {{and numbers of}} fish caught between circle and J hooks rigged with dead natural fish bait (ballyhoo) and trolled for three oceanic predator species: dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), and wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri). Interactions were compared between circle and J hooks fished on 75 trips by two user groups (charter and recreational fishermen). Hooks were affixed to three species-specific leader types most commonly fished in this region: monofilament (dolphinfish), fluorocarbon (tuna), and wire (wahoo). Numbers of fish caught per trip and three potential mechanisms that might inf luence numbers caught (i. e., number of strikes, proportion of fish hooked, and proportion retained) were modeled with generalized linear models that considered <b>hook</b> <b>type,</b> leader type, species, user (fishing) group, and wave height as main effects. <b>Hook</b> <b>type</b> was a main effect at the catch level; generally, more fish were caught on J hooks than on circle hooks. The effect of <b>hook</b> <b>type</b> on strike rates was equivocal. However, J hooks had {{a greater proportion of}} hook-ups than did circle hooks. Finally, the proportion of fish retained once hooked was generally equal between <b>hook</b> <b>types.</b> We found similar results when data from additional species were pooled as a “tuna” group and a “mackerel” group. We conclude that J hooks are more effective than circle hooks at the hook-up level and result in greater numbers of troll-caught dolphinfish, tuna...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} a quantitative review to evaluate circle hook use in recreational and commercial hook-and-line fisheries that interact with billfishes (Family: Istiophoridae). Specifically, we scrutinized {{the findings of}} 11 recent empirical studies that reported, on a species-specific basis, side-by-side measures of circle vs. J-hook fishing performance: catch, mortality, deep-hooking and bleeding rates. Of the 30 total comparisons extracted from the literature that satisfied our inclusion criteria, 13 indicated significant differences between <b>hook</b> <b>types</b> for the specific metric compared. No study reported significant billfish catch rate differences between <b>hook</b> <b>types.</b> However, when significant differences between <b>hook</b> <b>types</b> were found, higher mortality rates and higher rates of deep-hooking and bleeding were associated with J-hooks relative to circle hooks. We conclude that empirical evidence is sufficient to promote circle hook use in almost all hook-and-line fishery sectors that typically interact with istiophorids. However, billfish conservation benefits will only be realized if fishers use unmodified circle hooks, commit to releasing live fish and take other appropriate measures which maximize post-release survival. While there may be fishing modes where circle hook effects are negative, for billfish conservation, we recommend managers grant exceptions to circle hook use only when experimental results support such a practice...|$|R

40|$|Engineers are {{tasked with}} {{designing}} new systems {{every day to}} meet changing or unexpected technical requirements. After the tragic explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger on January 28, 1986, NASA engineers embarked on a complete overhaul of many of their long-standing quality systems and procedures. When the official cause of the accident {{was determined to be}} an O-ring failure in the right Solid Rocket Booster, NASA's Shuttle Program initiated a thorough redesign of the rocket boosters' clevis ends, which are the O-ring's mating surfaces. One of the unique systems that NASA engineers developed {{as a result of this}} effort included a heating assembly that is coupled to the outside of the rocket boosters. When the assembly is affixed to the external surface of the boosters, the very nature of its design allows for the warming of the O-rings prior to launch. After the engineers completed the assembly's design, however, they found that it was nearly impossible to tighten the spanner nuts required for attaching the system, given the minimum amount of clearance they had in the limited and confined space. Under these circumstances, the standard wrenches typically used for tightening these types of nuts did not work, and there were no other existing devices to solve the problem. NASA engineers embraced the challenge, developing a torque wrench tool adapter that allowed for a full rotation of spanner nuts in confined spaces. The tool, which is similar to an open-ended crowfoot wrench and a fixed-face <b>spanner</b> <b>wrench,</b> contains two dowel pins that center and lock the wrench onto the nut...|$|R
