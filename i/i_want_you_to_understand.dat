Kimball stated (in an address to departing missionaries): Brethren, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{that it is not}} to be as it has been heretofore. The brother missionaries have been in the habit of picking out the prettiest women for themselves before they get here, and bringing on the ugly ones for us; hereafter you have to bring them all here before taking any of them, and let us all have a fair shake.|$|E

We do not want them. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> why, whether you end up agreeing or not." [...] She argued that obscenity laws were largely ineffectual, that when they were effectual they only suppressed pornography from public view while allowing it to flourish out of sight, and that they suppressed the wrong material, or the right material for the wrong reasons, arguing that [...] "Obscenity laws are also woman-hating in their very construction. Their basic presumption is that it's women's bodies that are dirty." ...|$|E

[...] This did not bother me much, as Indians do not eat such food. [...] At dinner-time that same day, when I sat down to our table, I saw to my surprise that there were pancakes before us. These were the ‘left-overs’ from the morning, and now the cook wanted to feed them to us. [...] Although I was very angry, I made no remark, but quietly left the table and went over where Buffalo Bill and the head officials of the show were eating dinner. Colonel Cody asked, ‘What is it, Standing Bear?’ ‘Colonel Cody,’ I replied, ‘this morning all the other races represented in the show were served with pancakes, but the Indians were not given any. [...] We do not object to that, as we do not care for them; but now the cook has put his old pancakes on our table and expects us to eat what was left over from breakfast, and it isn’t right.’ [...] Buffalo Bill’s eyes snapped, as he arose from the table. ‘Come with me, Standing Bear,’ he exclaimed. [...] We went direct to {{the manager of the}} dining-room, and the Colonel said to him, ‘Look here, sir, you are trying to feed my Indians left-over pancakes from the morning meal. [...] <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand,</b> sir, that I will not stand for such treatment. [...] My Indians are the principal feature of this show, and they are the one people I will not allow to be misused or neglected. [...] Hereafter, see to it that they get just exactly what they want at meal-time. Do you understand me, sir”’ [...] ‘Yes, sir, oh, yes, sir,’ exclaimed the embarrassed manager. [...] After that, we had no more trouble about our meals.” ...|$|E
