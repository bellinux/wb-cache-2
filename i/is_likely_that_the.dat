5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{traditional}} use of narcissi for {{the treatment}} of cancer was due to the presence of isocarbostyril constituents such as narciclasine, pancratistatin and their congeners. N. poeticus contains about 0.12g of narciclasine per kg of fresh bulbs.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{surviving}} prehistoric stone monuments on Exmoor are located on those areas of moorland outside the limits of medieval and post-medieval agriculture. For this reason it <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> surviving sites are not a reliable indicator of the original extent of these sites.|$|E
5|$|Quality of {{life may}} be {{significantly}} reduced, {{even in those}} people on optimum medical therapy. Many report both physical and psychological problems. It <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> commonly used replacement therapies do not completely mimic the natural hormone levels in the body. Health costs remain about double those of the normal population.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} shown to <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> NSA has {{inserted}} an asymmetric backdoor into the NIST certified pseudorandom number generator Dual_EC_DRBG.|$|R
60|$|It {{seems to}} me, <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> <b>likelier</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> flowers which have no scent, color, nor honey, don't get any {{attention}} from the bees.|$|R
30|$|It <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> use of {{compression}} garments {{during the}} post-exercise period {{may have had}} some favorable effect on recovery of power output for upper body muscles.|$|R
5|$|The gods {{involved}} in a festival also received various offerings in much larger quantities than in daily ceremonies. The enormous amounts of food listed in festival texts are unlikely to have been divided among the priests alone, so it <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> celebrating commoners also participated in the reversion of these offerings.|$|E
5|$|Through his daughter, {{he is an}} {{ancestor}} of the Beauchamp family of Elmley in Worcestershire, a scion of which, William de Beauchamp, became Earl of Warwick. It <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Beauchamp family's symbol, a bear, derives from their relationship to Urse.|$|E
5|$|A second church, also {{dedicated}} to St Michael, was built of local sandstone in the 14th century by the Abbot Adam of Sodbury, incorporating {{the foundations of}} the previous building. It included stained glass and decorated floor tiles. There was also a portable altar of Purbeck Marble; it <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Monastery of St Michael on the Tor was a daughter house of Glastonbury Abbey. In 1243 Henry III granted a charter for a six-day fair at the site.|$|E
5000|$|The {{property}} was {{offered for sale}} in early 2004. Despite claims <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new buyer would demolish the property and redevelop it, the Government of Hong Kong did not act.|$|R
25|$|The {{prosecution}} had called expert witnesses {{at the trial}} whose evidence suggested <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> particle of FDR came from a gun fired by Barry George rather than from some other source.|$|R
5000|$|Sometime {{during the}} 17th century, it <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fort <b>was</b> constructed, {{at a time}} when the Captain-major, João Falcão de Sousa, {{exercised}} his position as superintendent for the island's defense. A 1717 report described these defenses as: ...|$|R
5|$|An {{analysis}} {{conducted using}} X-ray fluorescence {{has found that}} the pendant was made from a highly debased gold alloy, with only 37% of the alloy consisting of gold and the remainder consisting of silver with some copper. It <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gold came from melted-down coins of the Merovingian dynasty of Francia. The Frankish currency underwent a similar debasing at around this time. The link with Francia is illustrative of the trading and cultural links that existed between Anglo-Saxon England and continental Europe at the time.|$|E
5|$|Differences in songs, {{genetics}} and morphology {{suggests that the}} Azores were colonised in a single invasion in the late Pleistocene, about 100,000 years ago. It <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> initial colonisation was of the easternmost islands, with a subsequent spread to the central and western island groups from the western caldera of São Miguel, where both eastern and western song types are found.|$|E
5|$|Ecgberht {{was buried}} in Winchester, as were his son, Æthelwulf, his grandson, Alfred the Great, and his great-grandson, Edward the Elder. During the ninth century, Winchester began {{to show signs of}} urbanisation, and it <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{sequence}} of burials indicates that Winchester was held in high regard by the West Saxon royal line.|$|E
25|$|An interim {{board was}} {{appointed}} {{as the new}} leading party of cricket in Zimbabwe, with Peter Chingoka appointed as the committee's head. Given Chingoka's close ties to Bvute, it <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> latter would continue in his post as well.|$|R
60|$|After {{a search}} of two hours, Cnut decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{only place in the}} copse in which it <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{entrance}} to a passage could be hidden was a spot where the ground was covered thickly with ivy and trailing plants.|$|R
60|$|It {{was at once}} {{resolved}} to attack upon the following day. The two officers {{did not think it}} <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pirates would, even in obedience to their chief's orders, surrender the place until it had been battered by the fleet.|$|R
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{long journey}} and the siege had a {{detrimental}} {{effect on the}} Sultan's health. His death meant that any advances were postponed as the Grand Vizier {{had to return to}} Constantinople for the succession of the new Sultan, Selim II. Even if Suleiman had lived his army could not have achieved much in the short time that remained between the fall of Szigeth and the onset of winter. The prolonged resistance at Szigeth delayed the Ottoman push to Vienna.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{satellite}} site of Akte was {{the ruin}} that Spanish friar Andrés de Avendaño {{referred to as}} Tanxulukmul in early 1695. Teoberto Maler visited Motul de San José in May 1895, and described one of the stelae in his report Explorations in the Department of Peten, Guatemala, published by the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology of Harvard University in 1910. Ian Graham and Arlen Chase have separately mapped portions of the site core.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tonal {{lowering}} seen in {{this particular}} example {{is related to the}} low tone nasal prefix found in future tense constructions in some other Senufo languages. In fact, Supyire shows a similar phenomenon in future tense constructions with a direct object (in other future tense constructions, a low tone nasal is found).|$|E
50|$|Chapter VI of the Constitution of Australia allows {{new states}} to be formed, but only {{with the consent of}} the Parliament of the state in question. It has never <b>been</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> New South Wales Parliament would consent to the {{separation}} of New England.|$|R
50|$|It was {{reported}} in <b>the</b> interview <b>that</b> a new structure was being proposed to move the development to completion but that if this failed it <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> properties would <b>be</b> auctioned off in relation to an outstanding loan due by the development company.|$|R
50|$|The {{project was}} paralyzed by {{financial}} problems {{and has now}} been cancelled. It is extremely unlikely that this project will ever get constructed. Had it been constructed though, it <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Central Tower {{would have been the}} tallest building on Latin America.|$|R
5|$|Now, {{the match}} is {{recognised}} as the initial first-class match {{to be played}} in Australia. At the time, it <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> players realised that the game {{was the first to}} take place between two Australian colonies, and was therefore a historic occasion. Although there were attempts in Australia to identify first-class matches, no formal definition was applied in Australia until 1947. A meeting of the International Cricket Conference in 1981 agreed that all intercolonial and interstate matches played in Australia before 1947, including the 1851 match, should retrospectively be considered first-class.|$|E
5|$|Slaughter {{was elected}} {{lieutenant}} governor in 1808. In a four-man race, he {{received more than}} three times the number of votes as his nearest opponent. His four-year term under Governor Charles Scott was largely undistinguished. Although the exact date is unknown, it <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> death of Slaughter's second wife preceded his election as lieutenant governor. On October 3, 1811, he married his third wife, Elizabeth (Thompson) Rodes, a widow from Scott County.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the stone}} taken from the castle was used to {{construct}} the mid-eighteenth-century grade II-listed buildings at 43 and 45 Castle Street, and other buildings known to have used the stone, but no longer extant, include old houses demolished to build the Castle Mill textile factory. The mill, now demolished, {{was said to have}} been built on castle foundations up to 4m (12ft) thick; 15 Castle Street also rests on the old foundation wall. It <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> former Melbourne Furnace and the Furnace Farm barn also used recycled castle material.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacture}} {{of the four}} suits took four or five months. Two stolen circular saws and iron tacks were tried and found not to be bulletproof. Mouldboards for plough shares were ultimately adopted. It <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first suit made was defective, and was therefore discarded.|$|R
50|$|A scene {{relating}} to {{the identity of the}} mother, involving Ted's future children, was filmed in 2006 for the show's eventual series finale. This was done because it <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> teenage actors portraying them would be adults by the time the final season was shot.|$|R
50|$|The only {{explosive}} positively {{identified in}} any site {{connected to the}} bombings has been Goma 2 ECO and the sentence in <b>the</b> trial concluded <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bombs contained this explosive or a mixture of it with its predecessor product Goma 2 EC.|$|R
5|$|The 1224 carucage was a tax levied {{only on the}} clergy, and the {{revenues}} from it did not appear in that year's Pipe Roll. It <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> clergy who owed the carucage also collected the tax. Records indicate {{that the bulk of}} the money raised was paid into the Wardrobe, the king's personal treasury, rather than the Exchequer. The 1224 assessment was based on ploughteams, and was imposed to pay for the restitution of the lost lands in France.|$|E
5|$|The {{family name}} most likely {{derives from the}} Slavic kača (snake), the closest word to the name Kačić. Based on etymology, it <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian Kačićs (Kacsics) are {{originally}} of Slavic rather than Hungarian origin. Latin sources also refer to the name as de genere Chacittorum, generatione Cacich, genus Chacittorum, nobiles de Cacich, Caçici, Cacicii, Cacicli, Caciki, Cazethi, Cazichi, Cazziki, Chacichi and Kazzeti. The Kačić name is distinct from the similar-sounding name of another noble family, Kašić (Chasich), and its derivations (Kasig, Kasige).|$|E
5|$|The plot of Sherlock Holmes Baffled is {{unrelated}} to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's canonical Sherlock Holmes stories; it <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> character's name was used purely for its {{familiarity with the}} public. Shot from a single {{point of view on}} a stage set, the intention of Sherlock Holmes Baffled was probably to act as a showcase for basic film trickery and film editing effects, particularly the stop trick first developed four years earlier in 1896 by French director Georges Méliès.|$|E
50|$|The {{manufacture}} {{of the four}} suits took four or five months. Two stolen circular saws and iron tacks were tried and found not to be bulletproof. Mouldboards for plough shares were ultimately adopted. It <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first suit made was defective, and was therefore discarded.|$|R
50|$|The British government, under Prime Minister William Gladstone, was conciliatory as it {{realised}} {{that any}} further action would require substantial troop reinforcements, and it <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> war would <b>be</b> costly, messy and protracted. Unwilling to {{get bogged down}} in a distant war, the British government ordered a truce.|$|R
25|$|According to a Zogby Poll in the United States in late October 2007, 52% of {{respondents}} said they would support a US strike to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon and 53% said they believed it <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> US would attack Iran before the next presidential election in 2008.|$|R
