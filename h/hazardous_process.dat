50|$|The Manomet Mills are a {{historic}} textile mill complex {{on the north}} side of New Bedford, Massachusetts. They are located between Riverside Avenue and the Acushnet River, north of Manoment Street and the Whitman Mills. The complex consists of three Classical Revival brick buildings, built between 1903 and 1907. The main building, Mill No. 1, is a 54-bay three story structure that was built in 1903. It is attached to Mill No. 2 (1907), of similar size, by a single story brick structure. The third building is the Mill No. 2 Department Room (1907), a two story brick building that was originally connected to the other two via overhead bridges, now removed. The mill complex was the main operating site of the Manoment Mill Company, which produced cotton yarn until about 1928. The buildings were sold in that year to the Delaware Rayon Company, which went bankrupt in 1954.

5000|$|The German {{cockroach}} reproduces {{faster than}} any other residential cockroach, growing from egg to reproductive adult in approximately 50 - 60 days. [...] Once fertilized, a female German cockroach develops an ootheca in her abdomen. The abdomen swells as her eggs develop, until the translucent tip of the ootheca begins to protrude {{from the end of}} her abdomen, and by that time the eggs inside are fully sized. The ootheca, at first translucent, soon turns white and then within a few hours it turns pink, progressively darkening until, some 48 hours later, it attains the dark red-brown of the shell of a chestnut. The ootheca has a keel-like ridge along the line where the young emerge, and curls slightly towards that edge as it completes its maturation. A small percentage of the nymphs may hatch while the ootheca is still attached to the female, but the majority emerge some 24 hours after it has detached from the female's body. The newly hatched 3mm-long black nymphs then progress through six or seven instars before becoming sexually mature, but ecdysis is such a <b>hazardous</b> <b>process</b> that nearly half the nymphs die of natural causes before reaching adulthood. Molted skins and dead nymphs are soon eaten by living nymphs present at the time of molting.|$|E

5000|$|Though {{dating back}} to the {{discovery}} of the drug, the Nagai route did not become popular among illicit manufacturers until 1982, and comprised 20% of production in Michigan in 2002. It involves red phosphorus and hydrogen iodide (also known as hydroiodic acid or iohydroic acid). (The hydrogen iodide is replaced by iodine and water in the [...] "Moscow route".) The hydrogen iodide is used to reduce either ephedrine or pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine. On heating, the precursor is rapidly iodinated by the hydrogen iodide to form iodoephedrine. The phosphorus assists in the second step, by consuming iodine to form phosphorus triiodide (which decomposes in water to phosphorous acid, regenerating hydrogen iodide). Because hydrogen iodide exists in a chemical equilibrium with iodine and hydrogen, the phosphorus reaction shifts the balance toward hydrogen production when iodine is consumed (see Le Châtelier's principle). In Australia, criminal groups have been known to substitute [...] "red" [...] phosphorus with either hypophosphorous acid or phosphorous acid (the [...] "Hypo route"). This is a <b>hazardous</b> <b>process</b> for amateur chemists because phosphine gas, a side-product from in situ hydrogen iodide production, is extremely toxic to inhale. The reaction can also create toxic, flammable white phosphorus waste. Methamphetamine produced in this way is usually more than 95% pure.|$|E

50|$|Aggregated to the Hispania Tarraconensis province, the {{assimilation}} of the Asturian region into the Roman world was a slow and <b>hazardous</b> <b>process,</b> with its partially romanized people retaining the Celtic language, religion and much of their ancient culture throughout the Roman Imperial period.

However, ephigraphic evidence {{in the form of}} an inscribed votive stele dedicated by a Primpilus Centurio of Legio VI Victrix decorated for bravery in action confirms that the Astures staged a revolt in AD 54, prompting another vicious guerrilla war - unrecorded by the ancient sources - that lasted for fourteen years but the situation was finally calm around AD 68. Incredibly, they even enjoyed a brief revival during the Germanic invasions of the late 4th century AD, resisting Suevi and Visigoth raids throughout the 5th Century AD, only to be ultimately defeated and absorbed into the Visigothic Kingdom by the Visigothic King Sesibut in the early 6th Century AD. However, in practice it was not so and the Astures continued to rebel, with King Wamba sending an expedition to the Asturian lands only twenty years before the Muslim invasion of the peninsula and the fall of the Visigothic kingdom. The Astures chose Pelayo as their leader and formed the Kingdom of Asturias.|$|E

40|$|The {{establishment}} of ski runs and ski lifts, {{the action of}} skiing and maintenance of ski runs may cause considerable environmental impact. Clearly, for improvements {{to be made in}} the planning of ski runs in alpine terrain a good understanding of the environmental system and the response of environmental factors and processes to a new development is necessary. This requires the identification of environmental factors and processes that have a direct or indirect relation with a ski piste, such as hydrological <b>processes,</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>processes</b> and vegetation, and the acquisition of knowledge about them. Moreover, to find the best ski run alternative with respect to environmental concerns, we need to explore potential ski run locations distributed over the area feasible for a new development. Taking into account these issues, this thesis addresses four aspects, 1) the identification of environmental criteria that are important in the planning of environmental sound ski run, 2) the generation of potential alternatives that meet the conditions of feasible ski runs, 3) the development and application of spatio-temporal environmental models to evaluate alternative scenarios, in particular to describe the mechanism at a potential ski run location for the current situation and to analyse the response of the environmental system to the new development of a ski run, and 4) the integration of the environmental criteria by means of multicriteria analysis. While spatiotemporal environmental models generate maps for a certain number of time steps, traditional multicriteria analysis requires a value for each environmental criterion. Therefore emphasis is put on the integration of spatio-temporal models in multicriteria decision making (MCDM) and how the spatial and temporal model output can be translated into meaningful indicators.
