She continues to reside in a central London flat, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> family subsequently returned home to Christchurch. Although she spent most of 2006 touring, she did visit them when her schedule allowed.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Riefenstahl became {{interested}} in Africa from Ernest Hemingway's Green Hills of Africa and from the photographs of George Rodger. She visited Kenya {{for the first time}} in 1956 and later Sudan, where she photographed Nuba tribes with whom she sporadically lived, learning about their culture so she could photograph them more easily. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> film project about modern slavery entitled Die Schwarze Fracht ("The Black Cargo") was never completed, Riefenstahl was able to sell the stills from the expedition to magazines in various parts of the world. While scouting shooting locations, she almost died from injuries received in a truck accident. After waking up from a coma in a Nairobi hospital, she finished writing the script, but was soon thoroughly thwarted by uncooperative locals, the Suez Canal crisis and bad weather. In the end, the film project was called off. Even so, Riefenstahl was granted Sudanese citizenship for her services to the country, becoming the first foreigner to receive a Sudanese passport.|$|E
5|$|In the sixth-season premiere, Ross and Rachel's {{marriage}} is {{established to be}} a drunken mistake. Ross and Rachel try to get an annulment because he doesn't want to have three divorces. However, he realized he couldn't do so and tried to keep their wedding a secret from Rachel. Nonetheless, they divorce several episodes later. Monica and Chandler move in together, causing Rachel {{to move in with}} Phoebe. Joey lands a role on a cable television series called Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E., where he stars alongside a robot. Ross gets a job lecturing at New York University and starts dating one of his students, Elizabeth (Alexandra Holden). The relationship ends because of their maturity differences. Phoebe and Rachel's apartment catches fire, and Rachel moves in with Joey, while Phoebe moves in with Chandler and Monica. Chandler proposes to Monica, who says yes <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> ex-boyfriend Richard confesses his love for her.|$|E

5|$|Velázquez {{uses this}} light {{not only to}} add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E
25|$|On Sex and the City (1998–2004), {{exterior}} {{shots of}} Carrie Bradshaw's apartment building are of 66 Perry Street, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> address is given {{as on the}} Upper East Side.|$|E
25|$|Her {{father was}} a {{technician}} of the Magus Craft. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> {{father was a}} magician, Angelica, who only had {{the quality of a}} sorcerer, could not directly learn the ways of her father. She worked hard to find her own method of performing magic.|$|E
5000|$|On August 8, 2014, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring {{asked the}} United States Supreme Court {{to review the}} Fourth Circuit's decision. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>Herring</b> {{supports}} marriage for same-sex couples, he asked for review because [...] "the question presented is vital to a large population of same-sex couples, to their children, and to their fellow Americans who believe that discriminating against gay people is both unfair and unconstitutional. They may fairly call this 'the defining civil rights issue of our time.'" ...|$|R
50|$|U-56s {{first three}} patrols, {{completed}} during her workup and training period, were relatively uneventful cruises in the North Sea. No ships were attacked during this period; <b>even</b> <b>though</b> on <b>her</b> third sortie, she circumnavigated the Shetland Islands.|$|R

25|$|The Runaway enjoyed 17 {{performances}} {{during its}} first season at Drury Lane and 39 in London by 1800, a success that encouraged Cowley to write more, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> mentor Garrick retired after the 1776 season. She wrote her next two plays, the farce Who’s the Dupe? and the tragedy Albina, before the year was out.|$|E
25|$|U-325 sailed from Trondheim on 20 March 1945 for {{her third}} and final patrol and was ordered {{to return to the}} waters off Lands End. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> last report was {{received}} on 7 April, when Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945 U-325 was still considered operational by the U-boat High Command. However it soon became apparent that the submarine was lost.|$|E
25|$|After {{a two-week}} visit to Brunswick, Caroline headed for Italy through Switzerland. Along the way, {{possibly}} in Milan, she hired Bartolomeo Pergami as a servant. Pergami soon {{rose to the}} head of Caroline's household, and managed to get his sister, Angelica, Countess of Oldi, appointed as Caroline's lady-in-waiting. In mid-1815, Caroline bought a house, Villa d'Este, on the shores of Lake Como, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> finances were stretched.|$|E

25|$|In {{his book}} The Double Helix, Watson {{described}} being intimidated by Franklin {{and that they}} were unable to establish constructive scientific interactions during the time period when Franklin was doing DNA research. In the book's epilogue, written after Franklin's death, Watson acknowledges his early impressions of Franklin were often wrong, that she faced enormous barriers as a woman in the field of science <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> work was superb, and that it took them years to overcome their bickering before he could appreciate Franklin's generosity and integrity.|$|E
25|$|She {{was born}} as Hasegawa Yasu (長谷川 ヤス) in Tōriabura-chō in Nihonbashi; Tōriabura-chō is {{currently}} a part of Ōdenma-chō. Her parents were merchants; her mother came from a hatamoto family, while her father practiced law {{and was one of}} the first to do so in a modern manner in Japan. She was the oldest child and had two brothers and four sisters. Her work Old Tale Nihonbashi documents her childhood. She received exposure to literature through a live-in apprentice <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> mother opposed education for girls.|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} {{high school}} which ended at Grade 11, Muriel attended the Ontario Ladies College, a Methodist girls' school in Whitby, Ontario. Her aunt, Abbie Ball, taught there {{and offered to}} pay Muriel's fees. The College provided instruction in languages, history, mathematics and piano but little science. The 15-year-old Muriel was too shy to participate in drama <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> aunt was the school's drama coach. She also suffered from homesickness. Once a month, guest speakers, usually from the United Church of Canada addressed the student assembly. Muriel especially remembered James Endicott, then a missionary in China, {{who went on to}} become a prominent church leader and a lifelong acquaintance.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{this period}} {{she was in}} close and regular touch with her parents, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> father was {{increasingly}} busy with his political work. With the Labour Party victory in the 1945 election {{at the end of}} the War, Stafford had entered the cabinet as President of the Board of Trade, where he spent most of his time working on negotiations with the leaders of Indian independence, including Gandhi, Nehru and Jinnah. In November 1947, he became Chancellor of the Exchequer and most of the rest of his life he helped to manage the beginnings of the post-War recovery of Britain and the creation of the modern welfare state.|$|E
25|$|Black candles are {{presented}} to Santa Muerte's altars that drug traffickers used to ensure protection from violence of rival gangs {{as well as}} ensure harm to their enemies in gangs and law enforcement. As the drug war in Mexico escalates, Santa Muerte's veneration by drug bosses increases and her image is seen {{again and again in}} various drug houses. Ironically, the military and police officers that are employed to dismantle the White Lady's shrines make up a large portion of her devotees. Furthermore, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> presence in the drug world is becoming routine, the sale of black candles pales in comparison to top selling white, red, and gold candles.|$|E
25|$|At the Hungarian Championship in 1995, {{she claimed}} 9 gold medals. She competed at the 1995 European Aquatics Championships where {{she won the}} last two of her nine European titles in the 400m medley and the 200m {{backstroke}} event. For the first time, she competed in the 4×100m medley relay where one of her teammates was a young Ágnes Kovács, a future Olympic champion. They came second and Egerszegi has named this silver medal as 'the one that made her the happiest'. She decided not {{to compete in the}} 100m backstroke <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> time of 1:00.93 clocked during the 4×100m relay final was better than Mette Jacobsen's winning time of 1:02.46 by almost two seconds.|$|E

25|$|Possessing a high-spirited nature, Eleanor was {{not popular}} with the staid northerners; {{according}} to sources, Louis's mother Adelaide of Maurienne thought her flighty and a bad influence. She was not aided by memories of Constance of Arles, the Provençal wife of Robert II, tales of whose immodest dress and language were still told with horror. Eleanor's conduct was repeatedly criticized by church elders, particularly Bernard of Clairvaux and Abbot Suger, as indecorous. The king was {{madly in love with}} his beautiful and worldly bride, however, and granted her every whim, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> behavior baffled and vexed him. Much money went into making the austere Cité Palace in Paris more comfortable for Eleanor's sake.|$|E
25|$|In her {{contributions}} to Ken Burns's award-winning documentary television series Baseball (1994), Goodwin related stories {{about growing up}} as a Brooklyn Dodgers fan. She noted that her father would have her document the baseball game from the radio and replay {{the events of the}} game once he returned home. She cited this as her first experience as a historian. She chronicles her family's love for the Dodgers until the team's move to Los Angeles in 1957. When she met her husband in the late 1960s, she became a Boston Red Sox fan, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> father became a New York Mets fan; one of her sisters later became a Colorado Rockies fan, and her other sister stayed a Dodgers fan.|$|E
25|$|In the {{remainder}} of the Rider War, Eragon and Saphira are tutored by Oromis and Glaedr in Ellesmera. During an elvish Blood-Oath Celebration, Eragon is changed by a symbolic dragon, giving him elf-like abilities (speed, strength) and completely healing his back as well as all of his other injuries. Eragon then reveals his true feelings to Arya. After much persistence, Arya angrily rejects Eragon's suit. Meanwhile, Nasuada moves the Varden to the separate country of Surda which is ruled by King Orrin, and Roran moves the villagers of Carvahall to Surda, after their village was destroyed by the Ra'zac, who also captured Katrina. Roran is promoted to Captain while Nasuada allows the Urgals to join the ranks of the Varden, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> decision is opposed by many. Eragon and Saphira confront Murtagh and Thorn, who slew King Hrothgar.Thorn hatched for Murtagh and was magically made almost as big as Saphira. Murtagh bests Eragon, taking his sword Zar'roc, and revealing to him that they are brothers.|$|E
50|$|The priestess school Ennigaldi {{operated}} around 530 BCE was for upper-class young women. Ennigaldi {{spent much}} less time on corporal punishment {{because she had}} a devoted captive audience, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> otherwise <b>her</b> school resembled the other Sumerian scribal schools in its teaching techniques, curriculum, and student equipment. Literate women at her school were taught a special dialect called Emesal.|$|R
