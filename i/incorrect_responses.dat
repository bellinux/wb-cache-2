25|$|Teaching machines, {{though perhaps}} rudimentary, were not rigid {{instruments}} of instruction. They could be adjusted and improved {{based upon the}} students' performance. For example, if a student made many <b>incorrect</b> <b>responses,</b> the machine could be reprogrammed to provide less advanced prompts or questions—the idea being that students acquire behaviors most efficiently if they make few errors. Multiple-choice formats were not well-suited for teaching machines because they tended to increase student mistakes, and the contingencies of reinforcement were relatively uncontrolled.|$|E

30|$|For {{tasks in}} Parts 2 and 3 where written {{responses}} are expected, the accuracy {{was calculated by}} averaging the correctness of each task’s performance (correct <b>response</b> = 1, <b>incorrect</b> <b>response</b> = 0).|$|R
500|$|In interviews, Frobisher {{elicited}} the students' reasoning. One fifth-year {{decided that}} 0 was even {{because it was}} found on the 2 times table. A couple of fourth-years realized that zero can be split into equal parts. Another fourth-year reasoned [...] "1 is odd and if I go down it's even." [...] The interviews also revealed the misconceptions behind <b>incorrect</b> <b>responses.</b> A second-year was [...] "quite convinced" [...] that zero was odd, on the basis that [...] "it is the first number you count". A fourth-year referred to 0 as [...] "none" [...] and thought that it was neither odd nor even, since [...] "it's not a number". In another study, Annie Keith observed a class of 15 second grade students who convinced each other that zero was an even number based on even-odd alternation and on the possibility of splitting a group of zero things in two equal groups.|$|E
2500|$|Instead of buzzing in {{with the}} correct questions, contestants either give horribly <b>incorrect</b> <b>responses</b> or say things {{that have nothing to}} do with the game, {{frustrating}} Trebek who does nothing to hide his contempt for the celebrities' performance. Trebek's mood is also exacerbated by Connery's pranks and antics, which include making sexual jokes at Trebek's expense and implying that he has had sexual relations with the host's mother. Connery tends to misread categories and turn them into sexually suggestive phrases (such as [...] "Catch These Men", a category about people on the FBI's Most Wanted list, which he turns into [...] "Catch the Semen"), or even change them altogether by vandalizing or covering up their headers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{blocking}} hypothesis {{states that}} retrieval cues elicit the retrieval {{of a word}} related to the target that then blocks the retrieval of the correct word and causes {{the tip of the}} tongue phenomenon to occur. In other words, TOTs occur when plausible but <b>incorrect</b> <b>responses</b> to a query come to mind quickly. The person recognizes that the related words are incorrect but cannot retrieve the correct word because it is inhibited. [...] These related words are termed blockers because they block the ability to retrieve the correct word. This accounts for why TOTs predict memory performance. Once the inhibition of the correct word is removed or the blockers are forgotten, the TOT will be resolved. Evidence for this hypothesis is minimal as it is difficult to measure. Most research that takes on this approach give participants blockers and see if they produce TOT states. This method is controversial as it is unclear if the blockers given produce TOT states or act as retrieval cues.|$|E
50|$|The exam was {{conducted}} in a single stage that usually occurred on the first Sunday of May. The examination consisted of one paper containing 180 objective type questions from Physics, Chemistry and Biology (Botany & Zoology), having 45 questions from each subject. The exam duration was 3 hours. Each question carried 4 marks. For each <b>incorrect</b> <b>response,</b> one mark used to be deducted from the total score. However, no deduction from the total score was made if no response was indicated for an item. Indication {{of more than one}} answer for a question was deemed an <b>incorrect</b> <b>response</b> and negatively marked.|$|R

50|$|Although {{conformity}} pressures generally {{increase as}} {{the size of}} the majority increases, a meta-analysis suggests that conformity pressures in Asch's experiment peak once the majority reaches about four or five in number. Moreover, a study suggests that the effects of group size depend on the type of social influence operating. This means that in situations where the group is clearly wrong, conformity will be motivated by normative influence; the participants will conform in order to be accepted by the group. A participant may not feel much pressure to conform when the first person gives an <b>incorrect</b> <b>response.</b> However, conformity pressure will increase as each additional group member also gives the same <b>incorrect</b> <b>response.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the study}} of {{adaptive}} behavior, the stop-signal paradigm provides {{a measure of the}} efficiency of response suppression that lends itself to examining the ability to inhibit one's actions, and two complementary types of factors that may influence that ability. Based on neurobiological considerations, age-related individual differences were hypothesized to be such a factor. In agreement with the the cognitive-neuroscience literature, which emphasizes the relatively late maturation and early senescence of the (pre) frontal brain structures that are crucial for inhibitory control, results are reported of a study demonstrating that response inhibition in the stop task is subject to an unequivocal age trend during child development. Stop task performance was hypothesized to be influenced further by the effects of irrelevant information. In a concurrent reaction time task, distracter stimuli may induce activation of an <b>incorrect</b> <b>response.</b> The subsequent inhibition of this <b>incorrect</b> <b>response</b> activation may interact with the suppression of responses in the stop task, if both are engaged simultaneously. Indeed, in a study designed to examine this prediction, the operation of response inhibition in the primary-task and stop processes affected one another negatively when distracters were associated with the <b>incorrect</b> <b>response...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{separate}} {{stimulus and response}} conflict in a manual color–word Stroop task by combining electro-myography (EMG) and event-related brain potentials (ERPs). EMG served {{as a measure of}} response conflict by detecting <b>incorrect</b> <b>response</b> hand activation in correctly responded trials. Response conflict was enhanced in both the incongruent and congruent conditions relative to neutral conditions. This suggests that the Stroop conflict (incongruent vs. congruent condition) could be explained by stimulus conflict in our study and that response conflict was not restricted to the incongruent condition of the Stroop task. <b>Incorrect</b> <b>response</b> activity was detected in a neutral condition using words but not in a neutral condition with non-words. This suggests that the mere presence of task-irrelevant stimuli semantically related to task-relevant stimuli can prime <b>incorrect</b> <b>response</b> activity. The above factors are important to consider in studies which do not have any explicit measure of response conflict. We have detected a robust marker of Stroop conflict, the N 450 ERP effect, which has been related to ACC activity. The N 450 was probably affected by stimulus conflict in our study and it may be a marker of general conflict processing...|$|R

5000|$|Battle questions: The {{contestant}} and challenger face off, {{going back}} and forth giving answers to a question with a limited number of correct answers. Before the question is revealed, the contestant chooses whether to go first or second based solely on the category. Only five seconds are allotted per response, and only the first answer is accepted. If the challenger gives an <b>incorrect</b> <b>response</b> or runs out of time, the battle ends and it counts as a correct answer for the contestant, who earns $1,000. An <b>incorrect</b> <b>response</b> or exceeding the time limit from the contestant counts as a wrong answer. If all correct responses are given, the battle ends in a draw, the contestant does not earn $1,000, does not get a wrong, and does not have any accumulated wrongs eliminated.|$|R
50|$|In the Lightning Round, each {{question}} was worth 50 points, with 50 points deducted for an <b>incorrect</b> <b>response.</b> Lightning Round length varied wildly in Season 1, {{with an average}} range being 8 to 18 questions.

40|$|Several brain imaging {{studies have}} assumed that {{response}} conflict is present in Stroop tasks. However, {{this has not been}} demonstrated directly. We examined the time-course of stimulus and response conflict resolution in a numerical Stroop task by combining single-trial electro-myography (EMG) and event-related brain potentials (ERP). EMG enabled the direct tracking of response conflict and the peak latency of the P 300 ERP wave was used to index stimulus conflict. In correctly responded trials of the incongruent condition EMG detected robust <b>incorrect</b> <b>response</b> hand activation which appeared consistently in single trials. In 50 – 80 % of the trials correct and <b>incorrect</b> <b>response</b> hand activation coincided temporally, while in 20 – 50 % of the trials incorrect hand activation preceded correct hand activation. EMG data provides robust direct evidence for response conflict. However, congruency effects also appeared in the peak latency of the P 300 wave which suggests that stimulus conflict also {{played a role in the}} Stroop paradigm. Findings are explained by the continuous flow model of information processing: Partially processed task-irrelevant stimulus information can result in stimulus conflict and can prepare <b>incorrect</b> <b>response</b> activity. A robust congruency effect appeared in the amplitude of incongruent vs. congruent ERPs between 330 – 400 ms, this effect may be related to the activity of the anterior cingulate cortex...|$|R
50|$|Evidence for ACC {{as having}} an error {{detection}} function comes from observations of error-related negativity (ERN) uniquely generated within the ACC upon error occurrences.
