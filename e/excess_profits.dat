The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles. As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna. Any profits in excess of that amount would {{be turned over to the}} Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the <b>excess</b> <b>profits</b> by then being generated had to be given to the government.|$|E
25|$|Because the Rehn-Meidner model allowed capitalists owning very {{productive}} and efficient firms to retain <b>excess</b> <b>profits</b> {{at the expense}} of the firms' workers, thus exacerbating inequality, workers in these firms began to agitate for a share of the profits in the 1970s, just as women working in the state sector began to assert pressure for better wages. Meidner established a study committee that came up with a 1976 proposal that entailed transferring the <b>excess</b> <b>profits</b> into investment funds controlled by the workers in the efficient firms, with the intention that firms would create further employment and pay more workers higher wages, rather than increasing the wealth of company owners and managers. Capitalists immediately distinguished this proposal as socialism, and launched an unprecedented opposition—including calling off the class compromise established in the 1938 Saltsjöbaden Agreement.|$|E
40|$|The Economic Value Added {{formally}} translates {{the theoretical}} notion of <b>excess</b> <b>profit</b> (also known as residual income). Its use is so firmly entrenched in applied corporate finance and management accounting that its name {{is often used}} as a noun for denoting the concept of <b>excess</b> <b>profit</b> itself. This paper investigates the conceptual properties of such a notion and, in particular, it studies {{the relations between the}} <b>excess</b> <b>profit</b> generated in a period and the <b>excess</b> <b>profit</b> generated in the following period, showing that the classical approach forgets the past story of the project and the evolution of the capital invested. On the basis of this analysis, a new approach to residual income is offered, called Systemic Value Added (SVA). The latter takes account of the dynamic system governing the evolution of the capital invested, and is coherently additive in that the uncompounded sum of the SVAs leads to the Net Final Value. Interesting relations between the classical approach and the new approach are provided, and a final conventionalist position is endorsed: the <b>excess</b> <b>profit</b> is not an unambiguous concept and the choice between either approaches depends on the pieces of information one is willing to retrieve. ...|$|R

The House Ways and Means Committee endorsed Mellon's proposals, but some congressmen, who wanted to raise tax rates on corporations, fought the measure.

I listen to one side, and they seem right, and then—God!—I talk to the other side, and they seem just as right."

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an axiomatization of residual income, aka <b>excess</b> <b>profit,</b> and illustrates how it may univocally engenders fixed-income or variable-income assets. In {{the first part}} it is shown that, depending on the relations between <b>excess</b> <b>profit</b> and the investor's excess wealth, a well-specified theory of residual income is generated: one is the standard theory, which historically traces back to Hamilton (1777) and Marshall (1890) and is a deep-rooted notion in economic theory, finance, and accounting. Another one is the systemic value added or lost-capital paradigm: introduced in Magni (2000, 2003), the theory is enfolded in Keynes's (1936) notion of user cost and is naturally generated by an arbitrage-theory perspective. In the second part, the paper reverts the usual analysis: instead of computing residual incomes profits from a pattern of cash flows, residual incomes are fixed first to derive vectors of cash flows. It is shown that variable- or fixed-income assets may be constructed {{on the basis of}} either theory starting from pre-determined growth rates for <b>excess</b> <b>profit.</b> In particular, zero-coupon bonds and coupon bonds traded in a capital market are shown to be deducted as equilibrium vectors of residual-income-based assets. ...|$|R

The company had saved the profits, predicting that it would need them to cover income tax and <b>excess</b> <b>profits</b> tax. After these taxes had been paid there was approximately £1 million left, which they again saved, hoping to use this to cover any financial difficulties that might arise. [...] The reserves were again boosted with government money paid under the Trade Facilities Act 1921, but between 1921 and 1925 the profits of the company rapidly dropped and, beginning from 1926, the directors supplemented the company income by taking money from the reserves.|$|E
500|$|Daniels {{announced}} in October 2006 that a {{substitute natural gas}} company intended to build a facility in southern Indiana that would produce pipeline quality substitute natural gas (SNG). [...] The lead investor was Leucadia National, which proposed a $2.6 billion plant in Rockport, Indiana. [...] Under {{the terms of the}} deal endorsed by Daniels, the state would buy almost all the Rockport gas and resell it on the open market throughout the country. If the plant made money from the sale, <b>excess</b> <b>profits</b> would be split between Leucadia National's Indiana subsidiary, Indiana Gassification, and the state. If it lost money from the sale, then 100% of the losses would be passed onto Indiana consumers. [...] Leucadia agreed to reimburse the state for any losses, up to $150 million over 30 years. [...] Gas from the plant would make up about 17 percent of the state's supply. Critics feared that if gas prices fell over the next 30 years, the costs of the lost profits would be passed onto the bills of residents once the $150 million guarantee by Leucadia was used up. The deal also received criticism due to government intrusion in the energy markets. Questions were also raised due to Leucadia National hiring Mark Lubbers to promote the deal. Lubbers is a former aide and close friend of Daniels. [...] The Daniels administration maintained that the plant would create jobs in an economically depressed part of the state and offer environmental benefits through an in-state energy source. [...] The project was ultimately panned by the state legislature in 2013.|$|E
500|$|Before the war, the {{government}} spent 13 percent of GNP; in 1918 it spent 59 percent of GNP. The war was financed by borrowing large sums {{at home and}} abroad, by new taxes, and by inflation. It was implicitly financed by postponing maintenance and repair, and canceling unneeded projects. The government avoided indirect taxes because they raised the cost of living, and caused discontent among the working class. In 1913-14, indirect taxes on tobacco and alcohol yielded £75 million, while direct taxes yielded £88 million, including an income tax of £44 million and estate duties of £22 million. That is, 54 percent of revenue came from direct taxes; by 1918, direct taxes were 80 percent of revenue. [...] There was {{a strong emphasis on}} being [...] "fair" [...] and being [...] "scientific." [...] The public generally supported the heavy new taxes, with minimal complaints. The Treasury rejected proposals for a stiff capital levy, which the Labour Party wanted to use to weaken the capitalists. Instead, there was an <b>excess</b> <b>profits</b> tax, of 50 percent of profits above the normal prewar level; the rate was raised to 80 percent in 1917. [...] Excise taxes were added on luxury imports such as automobiles, clocks and watches. There was no sales tax or value added tax. The main increase in revenue came from income tax, which in 1915 went up to 3s. 6d in the pound (17.5%), and individual exemptions were lowered. The income tax rate grew to [...] 5s (25%) in 1916, and 6s (30%) in 1918. Altogether, taxes provided at most 30 percent of national expenditures, with the rest from borrowing. The national debt soared from £625 million to £7,800 million. Government bonds typically paid five percent. Inflation escalated so that the pound in 1919 purchased only a third of the basket it had purchased it 1914. Wages were laggard, and the poor and retired were especially hard hit.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{modelling}} in a formal way the concept of <b>excess</b> <b>profit,</b> also known as residual income. A common idea is that <b>excess</b> <b>profit</b> is an unequivocal concept, being the diference between profit and costs, where all types of costs are taken into account, included the opportunity cost, i. e. the profit the entrepreneur would obtain if she invested in another business. This paper aims at showing that this diference is not univocal and that diferent approaches may be followed to give voice to such a notion. It turns out that two diferent interpretations are possible. The one existing in the literature is well described by Preinrich (1938), Edwards and Bell (1961) and, more recently, by Peasnell (1981, 1982) in the accounting literature and by Stewart (1991) in the value-based management literature. The interpretation here provided gives rise to a diferent way of modelling the notion of <b>excess</b> <b>profit.</b> While the existing models are tied to the financial literature, the model here presented is more akin to a microeconomic perspective. The paper focuses on the formal relations among the various models and necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for the integration of all models in the systemic framework here adopted. Furthermore, it shows that the systemic paradigm enjoys an aggregation property which makes residual incomes aggregate in a value sense and enables one to reduce forecasting errors in valuation. ...|$|R

The military buildup spurred economic growth. Unemployment fell in half from 7.7 million in spring 1940 to 3.4 million in fall 1941 and fell in half again to 1.5 million in fall 1942, out of a labor force of 54 million. There was a growing labor shortage, accelerating the second wave of the Great Migration of African Americans, farmers and rural populations to manufacturing centers. African Americans from the South went to California and other West Coast states for new jobs in the defense industry. To pay for increased government spending, in 1941 Roosevelt proposed that Congress enact an income tax rate of 99.5% on all income over $100,000; when the proposal failed, he issued an executive order imposing an income tax of 100% on income over $25,000, which Congress rescinded. The Revenue Act of 1942 instituted top tax rates as high as 94% (after accounting for the <b>excess</b> <b>profits</b> tax), greatly increased the tax base, and instituted the first federal withholding tax. In 1944, Roosevelt requested that Congress enact legislation which would tax all [...] "unreasonable" [...] profits, both corporate and individual, and thereby support his declared need for over $10 billion in revenue for the war and other government measures. Congress overrode Roosevelt's veto to pass a smaller revenue bill raising $2 billion.|$|E

40|$|How {{should the}} <b>excess</b> <b>profit</b> because of {{inventory}} pooling be shared amongst firms {{at different levels}} along the supply chain? Suppose each of several retailers observes local demand for a common item and places an order at the supplier, which is immediately filled if the supplier has the item in stock. The supplier can fill retailer orders either from their reserved inventories or from a shareable pool of inventory. Using terminology from cooperative game theory, we say that the supplier and the retailers whose orders are filled from the common pool have formed an inventory-pooling coalition and study the use of Shapley value to allocate the expected <b>excess</b> <b>profit</b> because of pooling. We find that under Shapley value allocations the retailers have incentive to join the inventory-pooling coalition, and the supplier carries the level of inventory that is optimal for the coalition. Shapley value allocations might not lie within {{the core of the}} game, but the grand coalition of all players is stable in the farsighted sense. And, although the supplier's share of the expected <b>excess</b> <b>profit</b> is largest when all the retailers participate in the inventory-pooling coalition, the allocations to the retailers may diminish as the coalition grows. Colluding against the supplier (by merging and forming larger retailers) may seem like an appealing strategy for the retailers to increase their share of the total supply chain profit, but we find that the total expected after-pooling profits of retailers may instead go down because of collusion. supply chain management, incentives and contracting...|$|R
