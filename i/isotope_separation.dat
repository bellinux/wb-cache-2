50|$|Uranium hexafluoride is very corrosive, which {{presented}} serious handling difficulties, {{leading to}} serious {{consideration of the}} borohydride. However, {{by the time the}} synthesis method was finalized, the problems related to uranium hexafluoride were already solved. Borohydrides are nonideal ligands for <b>isotope</b> <b>separations,</b> since boron occurs naturally with two abundant isotopes, 10B (20%) and 11B (80%).|$|R

5|$|In nature, uranium {{is found}} as uranium-238 (99.2742%) and {{uranium-235}} (0.7204%). <b>Isotope</b> <b>separation</b> concentrates (enriches) the fissionable uranium-235 {{for nuclear weapons}} and most nuclear power plants, except for gas cooled reactors and pressurised heavy water reactors. Most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium-235 must impact other uranium-235 atoms to sustain the nuclear chain reaction. The concentration and amount of uranium-235 needed to achieve {{this is called a}} 'critical mass'.|$|E

5|$|Lithium {{isotopes}} fractionate substantially {{during a}} wide variety of natural processes, including mineral formation (chemical precipitation), metabolism, and ion exchange. Lithium ions substitute for magnesium and iron in octahedral sites in clay minerals, where 6Li is preferred to 7Li, resulting in enrichment of the light isotope in processes of hyperfiltration and rock alteration. The exotic 11Li is known to exhibit a nuclear halo. The process known as laser <b>isotope</b> <b>separation</b> can be used to separate lithium isotopes, in particular 7Li from 6Li.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian {{physicist}} Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists— Frisch and Rudolf Peierls—the task {{of investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within {{an order of magnitude}} of 10kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. Research into how uranium <b>isotope</b> <b>separation</b> (uranium enrichment) could be achieved assumed enormous importance. Frisch's first thought about how this could be achieved was with liquid thermal diffusion.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the nuclear reactor, Szilard submitted patent applications for a linear accelerator in 1928, and a cyclotron in 1929. He also conceived {{the idea of an}} electron microscope. Between 1926 and 1930, he worked with Einstein {{on the development of the}} Einstein refrigerator. After Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany in 1933, Szilard urged his family and friends to flee Europe while they still could. He moved to England, where he helped found the Academic Assistance Council, an organization dedicated to helping refugee scholars find new jobs. While in England he discovered a means of <b>isotope</b> <b>separation</b> known as the Szilard–Chalmers effect.|$|E
40|$|The carbon slit pore {{has been}} {{investigated}} as a medium for low temperature hydrogen <b>isotope</b> mixture <b>separation.</b> It is shown that the path integral formalism with Silvera-Goldman potential provides the most accurate results for the adsorption simulations. At 40 K, an operating pressure of 1. 0 bar and carbon slit width of 0. 56 nm {{is found to be}} optimal for efficient quantum separation. Simulations for practical separation processes using a 99. 95 % H 2 and 0. 05 % D 2 bulk composition H 2 /D 2 mixture, using the optimal carbon slit pore at 40 K and 1. 0 bar, demonstrate that the deuterium mole fraction increases from 0. 05 to 50. 3 % after three separation steps.

Ceramic filters {{have a large}} use in industries particularly in the corrosive, high-temperature and high-pressure environment. These filters are recoverable. It is also possible to improve the filtration quality of these filters by ameliorating the holes and consequently the porosity of ceramic filters results in decreasing the pressure drop and increasing the separation efficiency [6, 7, 8]. These filters offer a unique method {{in the treatment of}} effluents in industries. The ceramic filters can also be used for gaseous <b>separation,</b> especially for <b>isotope</b> <b>separations</b> of an element in the nuclear industries [9, 10].|$|R

5|$|In early 1944 the Currans {{were part}} of a group of British {{scientists}} invited to go to the US to take part in the Manhattan Project – the Allied project to develop an atomic bomb. They joined the British Mission at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory in California, headed by Mark Oliphant, a distinguished Australian scientist that Joan knew from the Cavendish Laboratory. Oliphant also acted as de facto deputy to Ernest Lawrence, the director of the Radiation Laboratory. The mission of the laboratory was to develop the electromagnetic <b>isotope</b> <b>separation</b> process to create enriched uranium for use in atomic bombs.|$|E
5|$|Karl P. Cohen(1913–2012) was an American chemist {{that worked}} as a {{research}} assistant {{under the direction of}} Harold Urey. Cohen’s greatest accomplishment was his work with Urey at Columbia, where he helped to perfect the enrichment techniques used in the Manhattan Project. He was {{a major player in the}} development of the centrifuge <b>isotope</b> <b>separation,</b> which is now the most commonly used way of uranium enrichment.He became an advisor for Standard Oil and worked towards the possibility of the nuclear energy. Cohen later started his work with General Electric Company and created the Reactor Safety Committee there.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence went on {{to build}} a series of ever larger and more {{expensive}} cyclotrons. His Radiation Laboratory became an official department of the University of California in 1936, with Lawrence as its director. In addition {{to the use of}} the cyclotron for physics, Lawrence also supported its use in research into medical uses of radioisotopes. During World War II, Lawrence developed electromagnetic <b>isotope</b> <b>separation</b> at the Radiation Laboratory. It used devices known as calutrons, a hybrid of the standard laboratory mass spectrometer and cyclotron. A huge electromagnetic separation plant was built at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which came to be called Y-12. The process was inefficient, but it worked.|$|E
40|$|A {{general theory}} of <b>isotopes</b> <b>separation</b> in a gas {{centrifuge}} based on a radial averaging method has been developed. The ultimate upper limit for a centrifuge separative power is expressed {{as a function of}} its external parameters. This is a more accurate definition of the centrifuge efficiency upper limit than the well-known Dirac's estimation or estimations of his followers, because it takes into account the feed flow value (throughput) and it provides the way to a one-dimensional diffusion equation without a lot of assumptions. For the first time the problem of an energy efficient centrifuge is formulated and the solution is obtained. Two cases of a centrifuge internal flow optimization are compared. The optimal internal circulations for both optimization cases are calculated. The results help us to understand how far the modern centrifuges are from their highest possible effectiveness limit and to identify ways to improve centrifuge performance. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this task was to demonstrate that metal hydrides could be produced by mechanical alloying in the quantities needed to support production-scale hydrogen <b>isotope</b> <b>separations.</b> Three starting compositions (ratios of elemental Zr and Fe powders) were selected and attritor milled under argon for times of 8 to 60 hours. In general, milling times of at least 24 hours were required to form the desired Zr{sub 2 }Fe and Zr{sub 3 }Fe phases, although {{a considerable amount of}} unalloyed Zr and Fe remained. Milling in liquid nitrogen does not appear to provide any advantages over milling in hexane, particularly due to the formation of ZrN after longer milling times. Carbides of Zr formed during some of the milling experiments in hexane. Elemental Zr was present in the as-milled material but not detected after annealing for milling times of 48 and 60 hours. It may be that after intimate mixing of the powders in the attritor mill the annealing temperature was sufficient to allow for the formation of a Zr-Fe alloy. Further investigation of this conversion is necessary, and could provide an opportunity for reducing the amount of unreacted metal powder after milling...|$|R

During the Second World War, Massey worked at the Admiralty Research Laboratory , where he helped devise countermeasures for German magnetic naval mines, and at the Admiralty Mining Establishment in Havant, where he helped develop British naval mines. In 1943, Mark Oliphant persuaded the Admiralty to release Massey {{to work on the}} Manhattan Project.

40|$|AbstractCalutrons were {{developed}} in the laboratory of E. O. Lawrence at the University of California at Berkeley. They were a modification of the cyclotrons he had invented and used in his Noble Prize winning investigations of the atomic nucleus. At the time their construction was undertaken, calutrons represented the only certain means of preparing enriched uranium isotopes {{for the construction of}} a fission bomb. The effort was successful enough that every atom of the 42 kg of 235 U used in the first uranium bomb had passed through at least one stage of calutron separation. At peak production, the first stage separators, α tanks, yielded an aggregate 258 -g/d 235 U enriched to about 10 at. % from its natural abundance level of 0. 72 at. %. The second stage separators, β tanks, used the 10 at. % material as feedstock and produced a total 204 -g/d 235 U enriched to at least 80 at. %. The latter, weapons grade, material was used in fission bombs. Under typical operating conditions, each α tank operated at a uranium beam intensity at the collectors of approximately 20 mA and each β tank at a beam intensity of approximately 215 mA at the collectors. Bulk <b>separation</b> of <b>isotopes</b> for bomb production ceased in 1945. Since that time calutrons have been used to separate stable isotopes, but on a more limited scale than wartime weapons production. Stable <b>isotope</b> <b>separations</b> since 1960 have taken place using one modified beta tank...|$|R
5|$|Electromagnetic <b>isotope</b> <b>separation</b> was {{developed}} by Lawrence at the University of California Radiation Laboratory. This method employed devices known as calutrons, a hybrid of the standard laboratory mass spectrometer and cyclotron. The name {{was derived from the}} words California, university and cyclotron. In the electromagnetic process, a magnetic field deflected charged particles according to mass. The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient. Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic separation plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build. Nonetheless, the process was approved because it was based on proven technology and therefore represented less risk. Moreover, it could be built in stages, and rapidly reach industrial capacity.|$|E

He directed the enormous construction effort, made critical decisions on the various methods of <b>isotope</b> <b>separation,</b> acquired raw materials, directed the collection of military intelligence on the German nuclear energy project and helped select the cities in Japan that were chosen as targets. Groves wrapped the Manhattan Project in security but failed to prevent the Soviet Union from conducting a successful espionage program that stole some of its most important secrets.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} also investigated electromagnetic <b>isotope</b> <b>separation.</b> At Princeton University, a {{group led by}} Henry D. Smyth and Robert R. Wilson developed a device known as an isotron. Using a klystron, {{they were able to}} separate isotopes using high-voltage electricity rather than magnetism. Work continued until February 1943, when, in view of the greater success of the calutron, work was discontinued and the team was transferred to other duties. At Cornell University a group under Lloyd P. Smith that included William E. Parkins, and A. Theodore Forrester devised a radial magnetic separator. They were surprised that their beams were more precise than expected, and, like Lawrence, deduced that it was a result of stabilization of the beam by air in the vacuum chamber. In February 1942, their team was consolidated with Lawrence's in Berkeley.|$|E
