500|$|Irene Kacandes, {{professor}} of German Studies and Comparative Literature at Dartmouth College, calls Rosa's internal monologues apostrophes, or [...] "intrapsychic witnessing", in which [...] "a character {{witnesses to the}} self about the character's own experience". Kacandes points out that Rosa believes {{she would not be}} able to internalise anything if she knew someone was listening. In an apostrophe addressed to Conrad, Rosa remarks, [...] "If you knew <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> you I wouldn't be able to talk". But because Rosa is not vocalising her monologues, no one can hear her, and she is able to proceed with her self-analysis unhindered. Kacandes says [...] "Rosa imagines an interlocutor and then occupies that place herself." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the {{biography}} Michael Jackson: The Magic and the Madness, written by journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli, the pop singer had shown an early {{attachment to the}} story of E.T. After a publicity photo shoot for the soundtrack album in which an animatronic robot of the extraterrestrial character hugged Jackson, the singer stated with wonderment, [...] "He was so real that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> him. I kissed him before I left. The next day, I missed him." [...] Jackson later revealed in the December 1982 issue of Ebony magazine—in which both he and E.T. appear on the cover—that he felt he actually was the creature during the album recording and shared his thoughts on why he had such a strong connection to the character: ...|$|E
500|$|A similar, {{although}} more indepth, {{story of the}} recruitment of Gholston has been told by Wilcher: [...] "He {{was walking down the}} hall with a Bible in his hands," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "He was already built like a grown man; he was all cut up (like a bodybuilder). I asked him, 'Can I help you sir?' He looked around to see who <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to.</b> I said, 'Are you looking for a student?' He said, 'No, I go here.' He said he was a freshman. I thought he was lying." [...] When the defensive coordinator kicked Gholston off the team for being too soft, Wilcher went to his house and dragged him back into the program: [...] "I told him I didn't care if he wasn't tough enough, he was going to play football for me," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "I knew that he had desire to play. My only regret is that I didn't put him at running back. I didn't know how fast he was." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lloyd {{has been}} a lifelong {{supporter}} of Accrington Stanley F.C., and played for them during the 1960s. Lloyd has maintained links with the club after his playing career ended, and in May 2009 he voiced his wishes {{to become involved in}} the club {{from the point of view}} of investment. He stated to the Accrington Observer that [...] "I love football and always have. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Eric Whalley about it the other day and he said he wanted to sell and I wish I could afford to buy the club off him. I can’t do that but I would like some involvement and perhaps raise the profile of Accrington Stanley. The town needs a football club – and I want to help to make sure they have one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lionsgate's {{president}} of theatrical marketing Tim Palen {{thought of the}} idea to make 1,000 posters {{with a small amount}} of Bell's blood, which was mixed with the printing ink. He said, [...] "We decided to do a poster and he's wearing a red cloak. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the printer and asked what we could do to get the deepest blood red. I asked if it would be possible to use actual blood. There was silence. He said, 'We could try, but are you serious?' I said I was dead serious." [...] The posters were sold for $20, with the first being auctioned off; all the proceeds from the auctioned poster were donated to the Red Cross. [...] Lionsgate also held the third annual [...] "Give Til It Hurts" [...] blood drive for the Red Cross and collected 23,493 pints of blood.|$|E

2500|$|One night I went to Q-Tip's {{solo album}} release party {{and at some}} point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone's been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I {{approached}} him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, [...] "No the fuck this nigga did not....." [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock.

That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted...|$|E
