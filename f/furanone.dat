30|$|Flavor {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} attributes that decides acceptability of food items that one consumes. The sensation of flavor perceived is usually because of a mixture of many compounds in the food. Nevertheless, some of them dominate the flavor of a particular food item and thus, are themselves capable of eliciting the flavor response in humans similar to that induced by food material. <b>Furanones,</b> which are found in some food products, represent one such dominating class of flavor compounds. In processed food, these compounds are formed as sugar degradation products by Maillard reaction induced by heat treatments (Schwab and Roscher 1997). <b>Furanones</b> are also important as naturally occurring flavor compounds. They are found in many fruits including strawberry, pineapple, raspberry, grapes, tomato, kiwi and mango and many contribute caramel-like flavor notes of these fruits (Schwab and Roscher 1997). In addition to having a sweet and pleasant odour, <b>furanones,</b> especially furaneol and mesifuran, are characterized by a low odour detection threshold (Pino and Mesa 2006). Our previous studies demonstrated that ripe mango fruits contain high amounts of furaneol (4 -hydroxy- 2, 5 -dimethyl- 3 (2 H)-furanone) and its methyl ether, mesifuran (2, 5 -dimethyl- 4 -methoxy- 3 (2 H)-furanone). The fruits of cultivar Alphonso contained higher amounts of these two compounds than those found in any other cultivar (Pandit et al. 2009 a), and ripening of Alphonso fruits was characterized by de novo appearance and increase in the level of these <b>furanones</b> (Pandit et al. 2009 b). Although <b>furanones</b> are not the most dominant compounds of the Alphonso fruits quantitatively, the low odour detection threshold of <b>furanones</b> makes their contribution to Alphonso mango flavor, about 20 -fold higher than that of any other volatile compound, in terms of odour units (Kulkarni et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common Salmonella serovars {{associated}} with human gastroenteritis and one of the main causes of bacterial food-borne diseases. Recent reports warn that a growing number of S. Typhimurium strains are becoming multi-resistant to various antibiotics. Moreover, S. Typhimurium is capable of forming biofilms on a variety of biotic and abiotic surfaces and these biofilms show a strongly increased resistance to antibiotics. Brominated <b>furanones,</b> which are secondary metabolites of the Australian red macro-alga Delisea pulchra, are able to inhibit biofilm formation and cell-cell communication (quorum sensing) in various bacteria without influencing the growth 1. However, nothing is known about their activity on Salmonella. In this study, we have chemically synthesized and screened brominated <b>furanones</b> for their biological activity on S. Typhimurium. The molecules were shown to inhibit S. Typhimurium biofilm formation in an early stage at concentrations which do not influence the growth of planktonic Salmonella cells. However, when added at later stages during the biofilm formation process, the molecules were less effective. Subsequently, we studied the influence of tetracycline on furanone-treated biofilms. We found that a certain concentration of tetracycline is able to remove furanone-treated biofilms, while this concentration could not eradicate non-treated biofilms. To investigate a possible link between inhibition of biofilm formation and quorum sensing, we tested the influence of the <b>furanones</b> on luminescence-based reporter systems for the activity of the two putative quorum sensing systems in S. Typhimurium, viz. the acyl-homoserine lactone receptor SdiA and the LuxS/AI- 2 -system 2, 3, 4. Addition of the brominated <b>furanones</b> reduced the luminescence produced by these reporter systems in a concentration-dependent way. However, addition of the <b>furanones</b> also affected the background luminescence in sdiA and luxS mutants. This suggests that the observed effect of the <b>furanones</b> on the quorum sensing reporter systems is not (only) dependent on the presence of SdiA and LuxS. The origin of the reduced luminescence remains to be elucidated. In conclusion, the inhibitory effect of brominated <b>furanones</b> on Salmonella biofilm formation opens perspectives for the development of novel anti-Salmonella compounds. status: publishe...|$|R

To get insights into the biosynthesis of these <b>furanones,</b> we isolated an enone oxidoreductase gene from the Alphonso mango.

The complete open reading frame was expressed in E. coli and the (his) 6 -tagged recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography. The purified protein assayed with NADH as a reducing agent converted D-fructose- 1, 6 -diphosphate into furaneol, the immediate precursor of mesifuran. The enzyme was also able to convert two highly reactive carbonyls, 3 -buten- 2 -one and 1 -penten- 3 -one, produced by lipid peroxidation in plants, into their saturated derivatives.

50|$|The {{flavor of}} mango fruits is {{constituted}} by several volatile organic chemicals mainly belonging to terpene, <b>furanone,</b> lactone, and ester classes. Different varieties or cultivars of mangoes can have flavor {{made up of}} different volatile chemicals or same volatile chemicals in different quantities. In general, New World mango cultivars are characterized by the dominance of δ-3-carene, a monoterpene flavorant; whereas, high concentration of other monoterpenes such as (Z)-ocimene and myrcene, {{as well as the}} presence of lactones and furanones, is the unique feature of Old World cultivars. In India, 'Alphonso' {{is one of the most}} popular cultivars. In 'Alphonso' mango, the lactones and furanones are synthesized during ripening; whereas terpenes and the other flavorants are present in both the developing (immature) and ripening fruits. Ethylene, a ripening-related hormone well known to be involved in ripening of mango fruits, causes changes in the flavor composition of mango fruits upon exogenous application, as well.

50|$|Utilization of halogen {{containing}} {{materials in}} {{processes such as}} water treatment, bleaching, or even general synthesis to create the final product, generates a number of organic halides. These organic halides are released in wastewater from the oil, chemical, and paper industries, and {{find their way to}} the consumer and eventually to a landfill or ocean fill. Within the soil, the halo compounds resist degradation and often react with metal ions, resulting in non-degradable metal complexes, increasing soil toxicity and accumulating in the food chain of aquatic organisms. Up to 2000 ppm of these bio-accumulative organic chlorides were detected in fat of fish from the waters where bleaching effluents were disposed by paper mills, where a 2% water concentration is considered toxic for the fish. While strict regulations from the government have reduced the high level of past emissions, these compounds find their way to water sources through improper consumer disposal of items that contain chlorinated compounds. The presence of any organic halides in natural water has been considered an indication of contamination with xenobiotics. Once in water, the naturally occurring fulvic acids and humic acids can lead to formation of mutagenic compounds such as halogenated <b>furanone</b> MX (Z-3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone). Consumption of these mutagenic compounds could cause several abnormalities in development and reproduction in humans through long half-lives and mimicking hormone receptors.

We also synthesised 5 - (bromomethylene) furan- 2 (5 H) -ones and 3 -(bromomethylene) isobenzofuran- 1 (3 H) -ones to further investigate their effects on biofilm formation by S. epidermidis. The effect on biofilm formation was assessed either by adding <b>furanone</b> to the growth medium or by allowing biofilm to form on surface-adsorbed <b>furanone.</b> <b>Furanone</b> effectively decreased biofilm formation by both application methods, but with surface-adsorbed <b>furanone</b> being most effective. The <b>furanone</b> concentrations used had no effect on microbial growth, and were also well below the established MICs, indicating that the effect was not a result of an antimicrobial effect. In order to determine whether the inhibitory effect was associated with the ability of <b>furanone</b> to interfere with microbial AI- 2 communication, AI- 2 deficient mutants were included. In contrast to their wild types, the amount of biofilm formed by the communication defective S. anginosus and S. intermedius was not affected when adding <b>furanone</b> to the growth medium. Biofilm formation on surface-adsorbed <b>furanone</b> was unaffected or partially affected for the communication defective S. anginosus and S. intermedius mutants respectively. Adding DPD, the synthetic AI- 2 communication signal, to the growth medium abolished the inhibitory effect of <b>furanone</b> on biofilm formation. Furthermore furanones were found to decrease bioluminescence by the AI- 2 reporter strain. Taken together, these findings support the assumption that furanones interfere with microbial communication, without affecting microbial growth. Finally, we studied possible irritative and genotoxic effects of the furanones. Only after using 1000 times higher concentrations than used in the biofilm assay, did we see an irritative effect.

30|$|Considering such crucial {{involvement}} of <b>furanones</b> {{in determining the}} flavor of mango and other fruits, the enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of <b>furanones</b> can have huge commercial potential for production of flavor chemicals. Nonetheless, biosynthesis of furaneol and mesifuran has until now been studied only in strawberry and tomato. Earlier studies on strawberry showed that out of several radiolabeled substrates fed to the ripening strawberry fruits, D-fructose- 1, 6 -diphosphate had {{the highest rate of}} incorporation into furaneol (Roscher et al. 1998). This, along with the other studies (Schwab 1998; Wein et al. 2001) confirmed D-fructose- 1, 6 -diphosphate as a natural precursor of <b>furanones</b> in the plants. Further studies carried out to understand the biosynthesis of furaneol in plants indicated that D-fructose- 1, 6 -diphosphate is first converted by an unknown enzyme into an unstable intermediate, 4 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 2 -methylene- 3 (2 H)-furanone (HMMF). The furaneol forming enzyme, enone oxidoreductase, highly similar to the NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, then reduces the exocyclic α, β unsaturated bond of HMMF, resulting in the formation of furaneol (Raab et al. 2006). Enone oxidoreductases from strawberry and tomato were capable of converting various derivatives of HMMF, substituted at the methylene group, into their respective saturated products (Raab et al. 2006; Klein et al. 2007). The presence of HMMF has also been detected in the fruits such as pineapple and raspberry suggesting that the biosynthetic pathway of <b>furanones</b> might be similar in various plants. Recently, an oxidoreductase, highly similar to strawberry and tomato enone oxidoreductase, capable of reducing α, β-unsaturated carbonyls, has been characterized from cucumber (Yamauchi et al. 2011). Apart from the pathway contributed by the plant, biosynthesis of furaneol in strawberry has also been suggested to occur in collaboration with enzymes from an epiphytic bacterium, Methylobacterium extorquens (Zabetakis 1997; Koutsompogeras et al. 2007; Verginer et al. 2010; Zabetakis et al. 2006).|$|R
