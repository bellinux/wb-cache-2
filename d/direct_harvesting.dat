50|$|The species, once {{abundant}} in the Caribbean, has declined significantly and {{is now one of}} the most endangered seabirds in the North Atlantic along with the bermuda petrel. In the early 20th century, there was speculation that the black-capped petrel was extinct, but more current population estimates range from 2,000-4,000 individuals. Most of the threats facing the black-capped petrel are on its nesting grounds, where causes for its demise include habitat loss, introduced predators, and <b>direct</b> <b>harvesting</b> by humans. Human predation appears to have become more limited in scope than in historic times, due in part to the species' current scarcity. Deforestation from wildfires and direct human use have likely decreased the amount of suitable nesting habitat available to the black-capped petrel. This is especially true on Haiti, which has suffered severe loss of forest cover in recent years.|$|E
50|$|Known predators {{of olive}} ridley eggs include raccoons, coyotes, feral dogs and pigs, opossums, coatimundi, caimans, ghost crabs, and the sunbeam snake. Hatchlings are preyed upon as they travel across {{the beach to}} the water by vultures, frigate birds, crabs, raccoons, coyotes, iguanas, and snakes. In the water, {{hatchling}} predators most likely include oceanic fishes, sharks, and crocodiles. Adults have relatively few known predators, other than sharks, and killer whales are responsible for occasional attacks. On land, nesting females may be attacked by jaguars. It is notable that the jaguar is the only cat with a strong enough bite to penetrate a sea turtle's shell, thought to be an evolutionary adaption from the Holocene extinction event. In observations of jaguar attacks, {{it was noted that}} the cats consumed the neck muscles of the turtle and occasionally the flippers, but left the remainder of the turtle carcass for scavengers as most likely, despite the strength of its jaws, a jaguar still cannot easily penetrate an adult turtle's shell to reach the internal organs or other muscles. In recent years, increased predation on turtles by jaguars has been noted, perhaps due to habitat loss and fewer alternative food sources. Sea turtles are comparatively defenseless in this situation as they cannot pull their head into their shell like freshwater and terrestrial turtles. Females are often plagued by mosquitos during nesting. Humans are still listed as the leading threat to L. olivacea, responsible for unsustainable egg collection, slaughtering nesting females on the beach, and <b>direct</b> <b>harvesting</b> adults at sea for commercial sale of both the meat and hides.|$|E

Metaphases suitable for karyotyping were obtained in 70 % of the cases; <b>direct</b> <b>harvest</b> yielded metaphases in 29 % and cultures without and with digestion in 40 % and 59 %, respectively. Chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 37 cases. Cells judged to be phenotypically abnormal in culture were twice as likely to reveal chromosomal aberrations as normal-looking cells. Eight cases showed multiclonal abnormalities. Significant differences were detected in the karyotypic profile depending on the method used. With <b>direct</b> <b>harvest,</b> the yield of complex chromosomal changes was 87 %, compared to 44 % after culture of digested tissue (P < 0. 01), and also polyploidy was more common in direct-harvested samples. Detailed karyotypic analysis was possible in 29 primary tumors. The chromosomes most frequently involved were 1, 3, 7, 11, 16, and 17. Recurrent structural abnormalities were der(1; 16) (q 10;p 10), i(1) (q 10), del(6) (q 21), and del(1) (p 22). Breakpoints clustered to the centromere regions of chromosomes 1, 3, 11, 15, and 16 and to the short arms of chromosomes 7, 17, and 19. Seven of twenty-nine fully analyzed cases had a family history of breast cancer, and changes of chromosomes 1, 3, and 15 seemed to be more common in these cases. There was an association between karyotype and survival: The 3 year survival was 63 % in patients with complex karyotypic changes and 92 % in those without complex changes...|$|R

30|$|An {{important}} attribute for old-growthness is {{the high}} number of late successional tree species (Bauhus et al. 2009), i.e. shade-tolerant and emergent mid-tolerant ones in the evergreen forest type.

It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the <b>direct</b> <b>harvesting</b> effects of single-tree selection (e.g. tree felling), as conducted in the present study, are compatible with preserving tree species richness and diversity within the evergreen forest type in the short term.

Extensive harvesting of very large and previously abundant reef-associated organisms has caused massive changes in coral reef ecosystems-throughout {{the last two centuries}} (Jackson et al., 2001), and contemporary fisheries continue to overexploit many reef species (e. g., Morris et al., 2000). Coral reef fisheries account for a relatively small proportion of global fisheries yield (< 1 %), but are fundamental in providing food and livelihoods in many tropical nations (e. g., Bell et al., 2009). Also, coral reef fishes are probably more vulnerable to exploitation compared to many other fisheries stocks (Russ, 1991), and overfishing of reef fishes with critical functional roles, such as herbivorous fishes, has contributed to extensive and accelerating degradation of coral reef habitats (e. g., Hughes, 1994, 1996) and greatly increases vulnerability to subsequent disturbances (Bellwood et al., 2003; Hughes et al., 2007) ...|$|E

40|$|Summary We have {{utilized}} the blast cell assay of Buick et al. (1977) {{to grow and}} subsequently cytogenetically analyze cultured colony forming cells (CFUs) from patients with acute and chronic myelogenous leukaemia (AML, CML). Cytogenetic analysis of CFUs was successful in 30 / 36 cases (83 %), a success rate similar to <b>direct</b> <b>harvesting</b> techniques. Identical clonal chromosomal abnormalities demonstrated by direct techniques were also observed in CFUs from AML and CML. Removal of T-precursor cells by E-rosetting prior to plating did not eliminate growth of karyotypically normal cells. The combination of morphologic and cytogenetic studies performed clearly established that the assay system supports the growth of leukaemic progenitors. Although both karyotypically normal and abnormal leukaemic colonies grew in this assay, growth of leukaemic colonies was much more likely if the plated cells were karyotypically abnormal (P= 0. 010). Leukaemic colony growth was also more frequent if the tritiated thymidine labelling index (LI%) of plated cells was. 5 % (P= 0. 018). Leukaemic colonies were most likely (P= 0. 018) to have been derived from plated cells with both abnormal karyotype and high LI % (> 5 %). Cytogenetic analyses from cultured cells revealed only those karyotypic features found in the uncultured cells (i. e., no additional abnormal sublines were found).
