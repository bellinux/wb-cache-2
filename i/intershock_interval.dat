40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} whether {{choice of a}} signalled variable-time shock schedule over an unsignalled one {{was influenced by the}} average <b>intershock</b> <b>interval.</b> Eight rats were given a choice between signalled and unsignalled shock schedules in a series of conditions with average intershock intervals of 510, 270, 150, 90, 60, and 45 sec. Each test condition was preceded by a training-baseline condition, and schedule values were arranged in an ascending (four subjects) or descending (four subjects) order. Choice of the signalled conditions was directly related to the average <b>intershock</b> <b>interval</b> of the variable-time schedule for six of the eight subjects. The per cent of time in the signalled condition was highest when the average <b>intershock</b> <b>interval</b> was 150 sec or longer and lowest when the average <b>intershock</b> <b>interval</b> was 45 sec. The findings were interpreted as being due to changes in the safety features of the signalled schedule, rather than to changes in the average <b>intershock</b> <b>interval</b> per se...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that unsignaled shock may accelerate positively reinforced operant responding if each shock signals a subsequent shock-free period. In order to explore the boundary conditions of this effect, two experiments were performed. In Experiment 1, pairs of unsignaled shocks separated by 15, 30, 60, or 120 seconds resulted in suppressed responding during the briefest <b>intershock</b> <b>interval,</b> and in accelerated responding during the longer intervals. When the second shock in each pair signaled a shock-free period of at least 3 minutes, accelerated responding also followed offset of the second shock in all but the 30 -second condition. In Experiment 2, the addition of a conditioned stimulus prior to each pair of shocks restored baseline responding, and eliminated accelerative control following the second shock only under the briefest inter-shock interval. The results are discussed in terms of the similarity between autocontingencies (shock/no-shock relations; Davis, Memmott, & Hurwitz, 1975) and recent modifications of the feature-positive procedure (e. g., Reberg & Memmott, 1979), which stress stimulus control by shock/no-shock relationships...|$|E
40|$|Squirrel monkeys {{were exposed}} to response-independent, fixed-frequency shock that {{produced}} biting attack upon a pneumatic hose. Attacks decreased within and across sessions at low intensities and high frequencies of shock, but increased within and across sessions at higher intensities and lower shock frequencies. Stimuli paired with shock, when presented alone, came to produce biting, and stimuli correlated with shock parameters that produced increases in responding within sessions produced similar increases when presented alone. Further experiments showed that continuing exposure to shock also produced lever pressing or chain pulling, with longer shock exposure again producing higher response rates. Whereas biting generally decreased throughout the <b>intershock</b> <b>interval,</b> manual responding generally increased as shock time approached, but immediately before shock was often suppressed. Following shock, biting attack predominated over manual behavior. The results suggest a {{possible explanation for the}} extreme resistance of avoidance behavior to extinction, and may also partially explain the persistence of responding during schedules of response-produced shock. Relationships of the present findings to naturalistic observations of relations between fleeing, freezing, and fighting performances are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Reviews the {{literature}} on predictability and describes the factors that affect choice. Emphasis {{is given to the}} reliability of basic findings, including replications and failures to replicate. Behavioral measures related to choice are reviewed, and some physiological correlates of predictable and unpredictable shock are noted. The data allow several firm conclusions regarding preference, notably that (a) rats (albino, hooded, male, female) prefer predictable shock conditions; (b) they prefer predictable conditions whether shock is avoidable, escapable, or inescapable and whether it is scrambled or unscrambled grid shock; (c) this preference occurs with different procedures, apparatus, and shock delivery systems, such as water electrodes or electrodes attached to the tail, back, ears, or pubis bone; (d) fish and birds also prefer the signaled condition; and (e) although the preference is robust, it is affected by shock intensity, signal duration, <b>intershock</b> <b>intervals,</b> amount of training, and the dependability of shock-free periods. Other factors that may affect preference are also noted. Finally, the theoretical views of conditioned reinforcement, of information, of preparation, and of safety are evaluated, and their strengths and weaknesses are describe...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{assessed the}} relative aversiveness of different duration preshock (PS) signals (5 and 20 sec) and different duration stimuli identifying shock-free periods. In Exp I, the responding of 15 of 18 female Sprague-Dawley rats was maintained when it produced changes from a predictable-shock condition with a 5 -sec PS signal to an identical schedule with a 20 -sec PS signal; responding was not maintained when it produced the opposite changes. These results occurred with <b>intershock</b> <b>intervals</b> of both 120 and 240 sec. Exp II assessed whether changing to the 20 -sec schedule was maintained by {{properties of the}} PS signals identifying the shock periods or by properties of the stimuli identifying the shock-free periods. Four similar rats were given training with the 2 signaled schedules in an operant chamber and then later given off-baseline preference tests in a shuttlebox. When given a choice between PS signals, Ss chose the 5 -sec over the 20 -sec signals. However, when given a choice between stimuli identifying shock-free periods, Ss chose the stimulus identifying the shorter shock-free periods (i. e., the one previously correlated with the 20 -sec signals). Findings are discussed within the R. A. Rescorla and A. R. Wagner (1972) model of stimulus compounds and {{within the context of}} safety as a contrast phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Most {{studies suggest}} that {{serotonin}} exerts an inhibitory control on the aggression process. According to experimental evidence, this amine also influences growth {{and development of the}} nervous tissue including serotoninergic neurons. Thus, the possibility exists that increased serotonin availability in young animals facilitates a long-lasting effect on aggressive responses. The present study aimed to investigate the aggressive behavior of adult rats (90 - 120 days) treated from the 1 st to the 19 th postnatal day with citalopram (CIT), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (20 mg/kg, sc, every 3 days). Aggressive behavior was induced by placing a pair of rats (matched by weight) in a box (20 x 20 x 20 cm), and submitting them to a 20 -min session of electric footshocks (five 1. 6 -mA - 2 -s current pulses, separated by a 4 -min <b>intershock</b> <b>interval).</b> When compared to the control group (rats treated for the same period with equivalent volumes of saline solution), the CIT group presented a 41. 4 % reduction in the duration of aggressive response. The results indicate that the repeated administration of CIT early in life reduces the aggressive behavior in adulthood and suggest that the increased brain serotoninergic activity could play a role in this effect...|$|E
40|$|Potential {{gradients}} imposed across cell or lipid membranes {{break down}} the insulating properties of these barriers if an intensity and time-dependent threshold is exceeded. Potential gradients of this magnitude may occur throughout the body, and in particular in cardiac tissue, during clinical defibrillation, ablation, and electrocution trauma. To study the dynamics of membrane electropermeabilization a cell-attached patch clamp technique was used to directly control the potential across membrane patches of single ventricular cells enzymatically isolated from frog (Rana pipiens) hearts. Ramp waveshapes were used to reveal rapid membrane conductance changes that may have otherwise been obscured using rectangular waveshapes. We observed a step increase (delta t less than 30 microseconds) or breakdown in membrane conductance at transmembrane potential thresholds of 0. 6 - 1. 1 V in response to 0. 1 - 1. 0 kV/s voltage ramps. Conductance kinetics on a sub-millisecond time scale indicate that breakdown is preceded by a period of instability during which the noise and amplitude of the membrane conductance begin to increase. In some cells membrane breakdown was observed to be fully reversible when using an <b>intershock</b> <b>interval</b> of 1 min (20 - 23 degrees C). These findings support energetic models of membrane electropermeabilization which describe the formation of membrane pores (or growth of existing pores) to a conducting state (instability), followed by a rapid expansion of these pores when the energy barrier {{for the formation of}} hydrophilic pores is overcome (breakdown) ...|$|E
