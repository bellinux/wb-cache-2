500|$|The {{magazine}} Private Eye made regular {{use of the}} Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells pseudonym to satirise {{the stereotypical}} conservative Middle Englander, {{and it became a}} running joke for several years. In 1978, BBC Radio 4 called its new listener feedback programme Disgusted, Tunbridge Wells, though it was renamed Feedback in 1979. This was following Radio 4 broadcasting the Take <b>It</b> <b>From</b> <b>Here</b> radio series in 1954 where [...] "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells" [...] was prominently featured. In politics, the people behind [...] "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells" [...] letters have strong conservative views and are commonly viewed to support the Conservative Party. However, most UK Independence Party (UKIP) members in the party's early days were viewed by commentators as being [...] "'Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells' pensioners", of which the UKIP leader Nigel Farage stated in 2013 [...] "I used to say you could always tell it was a UKIP meeting by the number of Bomber Command ties in the room." ...|$|E

2500|$|In George Perry's book The Life of Python (1999) he comments: [...] "In the Britain of 1950, humour {{was derived}} from three main sources: print, film and radio, and despite the advent of television, {{throughout}} the 1950s radio remained the dominant source of broadcast comedy. In this period, two radio comedy shows exercised a profound influence. The first was Take <b>It</b> <b>From</b> <b>Here,</b> with its polished professionalism. The other was The Goon Show, with its absurdity, manic surreality and unpredictability." ...|$|E
2500|$|Finally they rehearse {{lighting}} {{with the}} theatre technician (the never-seen [...] "Luke"). The play-within-a-play lasts {{only a few}} seconds: from darkness, to light falling on the man's head and then darkness again. Finally the Director exclaims: [...] "There's our catastrophe! In the bag" [...] and asks for one last run through before he has to leave. He imagines the rising of the expectant applause on the opening day (“Terrific! He’ll have them on their feet. I can hear <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>here).</b> The man has become, as John Calder puts it, “a living statue portraying, from the director’s point of view, the quiescent, unprotesting victim, {{a symbol of the}} ideal citizen of a totalitarian regime.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Although earlier BBC {{radio shows}} such as Much Binding in the Marsh, Take <b>It</b> <b>From</b> <b>Here,</b> and Beyond Our Ken had {{conditioned}} listeners to a mix of music, sketches and jokes in a 30-minute show, and Round the Horne was also doing this, ISIRTA accelerated the transitions, and it certainly seemed more improvised. It {{was one of those}} programmes where the listener was unlikely to get all the jokes on first hearing, so would have to listen to the scheduled repeat (or a tape recording) to discover what they had missed. It thus helped prepare the television audience for At Last the 1948 Show, Spike Milligan's Q series, Monty Python's Flying Circus, and The Goodies. It also may have influenced other spoof-based British radio programmes such as Radio Active, On the Hour, The Sunday Format, The News Huddlines, and later [...] "Bleak Expectations".|$|E

2500|$|Their next album, The Low End Theory, {{helped shape}} {{alternative}} hip-hop in the 1990s. It established {{a link between}} their hip hop based music and the jazz genre. It was a large success, and, on February 1, 1995, the RIAA certified the album platinum. Their following album, Midnight Marauders, released in 1993, also earned the platinum award. Beats, Rhymes and Life, their subsequent album which was released three years after Midnight Marauders, was considered their darkest work. It lacked the positive and joyful vibe present in their previous albums. Their fifth studio album followed, The Love Movement. It was regarded by critics as returning to the group's positive vibe. It was awarded gold by the RIAA on November 1, 1998. Their sixth and final album, We Got <b>It</b> <b>from</b> <b>Here...</b> Thank You 4 Your Service, was released on November 11, 2016, with posthumous contributions from Phife Dawg.

2500|$|We Got <b>It</b> <b>from</b> <b>Here...</b> Thank You 4 Your Service was {{released}} by Epic Records on November 11, 2016, to widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 91, based on 26 reviews; it was the year's best-reviewed hip hop album and fourth best-reviewed album overall, according to the website. Ray Rahman from Entertainment Weekly wrote that the record [...] "vividly demonstrates the group's unassailable greatness and continued relevance", while Christopher R. Weingarten of Rolling Stone believed that [...] "in both delivery and content", A Tribe Called Quest [...] "maintain {{the attitude of the}} Bohemian everydude funkonauts that inspired Kanye West, Andre 3000 and Kendrick Lamar (who all appear here)". Robert Christgau hailed it as a [...] "triumph" [...] in his review for Vice, writing that the record [...] "represents both their bond and the conscious black humanism they felt sure the nation was ready for ... urging us to love each other {{as much as we can}} as we achieve a happiness it's our duty to reaccess if we're to battle as all we can be." [...] In Spin, Brian Josephs praised how the group [...] "worked with the understanding that black music at its finest conversed with ancestry while pointing toward future possibilities in resistance against the racist forces that run parallel." [...] According to Michael Madden from Consequence of Sound, the album exhibits [...] "the classic Tribe sound: a warm and crisp confluence of East Coast hip-hop, jazz, and more, all mixed and mastered impeccably", while Clayton Purdom of The A.V. Club believed the music had more in common with Q-Tip's 2008 solo album The Renaissance than with the group's previous work; he called We got <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>Here...</b> "a sinuous sound collage pulling much more from ’90s and ’00s R than it does Native Tongues boom-bap". In The Observer, Kitty Empire wrote that [...] "as the album enters its final third, some focus is lost, but the first two-thirds take no prisoners either lyrically or musically." ...|$|E
