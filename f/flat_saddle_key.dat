30|$|We {{could now}} use a collect {{communication}} on the saddle points for every {{peak in the}} entire computational box. As a result of that, every task would have access to all saddle points of all his active peaks. The global <b>key</b> <b>saddle</b> and <b>key</b> neighbour could then be determined by every MPI task for his active peaks. However, this approach would introduce a lot of communication and unnecessarily fill the sparse saddle matrices. The only necessary information to perform one iteration in the merging process is the (global) <b>key</b> <b>saddle</b> density of a peak and the corresponding key neighbour. This global maximum saddle can be found by comparing the local maxima of each MPI task. We thus minimise communication by performing a collect communication only on the local maximum of each row in the saddle point matrix. Together with the local maximum saddle density, we collect the global peak ID that denotes the local key neighbour. The owner of a peak can now compute the global <b>key</b> <b>saddle</b> for a given peak by comparing all the local maxima. The global peak ID that was received from the MPI task which hosts the global <b>key</b> <b>saddle</b> is the <b>key</b> neighbour of the peak. If not already present, the key neighbour is introduced into the virtual peak boundary of the owner task and the <b>key</b> <b>saddle</b> density is written into the sparse saddle matrix of the owner. Every MPI task can now perform a complete iteration in the merging process without any further communication of saddle point densities.|$|R
30|$|A third peak i {{might be}} merged into n. The peak density of n cannot change due to that since it would mean that peak i had a higher density than n which contradicts the upward merging. The <b>key</b> <b>saddle</b> cannot change because this would mean that peak i had a saddle point s_ij higher than s_nm. This would imply that the saddle point s_ni through which i was merged into n was even higher, s_ni > s_ij {{otherwise}} s_ni had not been the <b>key</b> <b>saddle</b> of peak i. Yet, s_ni > s_ij>s_nm contradicts that s_nm is the <b>key</b> <b>saddle</b> of peak n. The peak density of n and its <b>key</b> <b>saddle</b> are thus unchanged, therefore the relevance of n is not changed either.|$|R

30|$|If desired, the {{remaining}} peaks and their associated clumps can be merged further to form composite clumps.

40|$|This study {{compared}} saddle pressure distribution {{patterns in}} a group of experienced cyclists riding their own bicycle mounting different saddle models. Two traditional <b>flat</b> surface <b>saddles</b> incorporating different shock-absorbent materials in the perineal area and two innovative saddles with a hole in the perineal area were evaluated. The T-Scan system was utilised to measure the saddle pressure distribution. Each subject showed an individual pressure distribution pattern when using the same saddle. The use of the different saddles resulted in same significant changes in the saddle pressure amplitude and distribution pattern in all the subjects examined. In general, the <b>flat</b> surfaced <b>saddles</b> showed a more uniform pressure distribution with less pressure on the anterior part and more on the posterior part compared with the saddle with a perineal hole. KEY WORDS: piezoresistive sensors, pressure distribution, road cycling. INTRODUCTION: When riding a bicycle, the cyclist distributes his body weight and the inertial forces arising from the movement of his body mass to the pedals, the handlebar and the saddle. In competitive road and mountain bike cycling, about 40 % of the body weight loads the saddle, which offers about 200 cm 2 of support to that load. Due to anatomica...|$|R

50|$|Most <b>flat</b> racing <b>saddles</b> weigh {{less than}} 1½ pounds; the lightest saddles weigh {{as little as}} 8 ounces. They {{generally}} have only one billet to attach the girth, and so an overgirth is usually added to keep it secure. Saddles used in steeplechases are generally slightly heavier and more substantial, usually being built on a full tree. Exercise saddles are usually larger and heavier, with a more prominent pommel and cantle to provide more security to the rider. Though these features add pounds, weight does not matter as it would in a race.|$|R

30|$|Using the {{relevance}} as a merging criterion {{results in a}} similar definition of a clump as it is obtained by algorithms that contour the dataset at evenly spaced levels in log-space (e.g., Williams et al. 1994). There, a peak-to-saddle ratio above a given value guarantees that a contour level will fall between peak density and <b>key</b> <b>saddle</b> density and thus the detection of the corresponding clump as an individual object. However, a contour level can coincidentally lie between the peak density and the <b>key</b> <b>saddle</b> density of an object with a very low peak-to-saddle ratio, resulting in the detection of an irrelevant density fluctuation as a clump. Merging based on {{the relevance}} removes this randomness from the analysis.|$|R
30|$|Now, we iterate the procedure: {{from the}} updated lists of <b>saddle</b> points, the <b>key</b> <b>saddles</b> are determined. Peaks are {{accessed}} {{in the order}} of decreasing peak density and irrelevant peaks are merged. After an iteration without any mergers, all irrelevant peaks have been merged or discarded and the noise removal is finished. Note that the described merging process follows exactly the same principle as the watershed segmentation. We have simply replaced cells by peaks, densest neighbour cells with key neighbours and the peak patch label by the final peak label. We call the structures which survive the noise removal Level 0 clumps. They constitute the finest structure (see Figure  1, third panel) in our hierarchy.|$|R
30|$|After having {{previously}} {{identified the}} saddle points, we classify the peaks {{based on their}} contrast to the background. We define the contrast as {{the ratio of the}} peak density to the <b>key</b> <b>saddle</b> density and name it ‘relevance’. This is sketched in the second panel of Figure  1. Every peak is assigned a ‘final peak’ label which is initialized to the peaks own peak ID and updated whenever a peak is merged to another one. The peaks are sorted by decreasing peak density. For each peak, the <b>key</b> <b>saddle</b> is determined from the list of saddle points and the relevance is computed. Peaks with a relevance below a relevance threshold are considered noise. 4 If the peak is relevant, it is not touched. For an irrelevant peak, we check whether its <b>key</b> <b>saddle</b> links it to a denser peak. If this is the case, it will inherit the final peak label from this key peak. As in the watershed segmentation, the previous sorting makes sure that the final peak labels can propagate through long chains of connected peaks in just one loop. If a peak is both isolated and irrelevant, it is discarded.|$|R
