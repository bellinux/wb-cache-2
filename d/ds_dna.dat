Inspired by marine creatures that present long tentacles containing multiple adhesive domains to effectively capture flowing food particulates, we developed a platform approach to capture and isolate cells using a 3 <b>D</b> <b>DNA</b> network comprising repeating adhesive aptamer domains that extend over tens of micrometers into the solution. The DNA network was synthesized from a microfluidic surface by rolling circle amplification where critical parameters, including DNA graft density, length, and sequence, could readily be tailored. Using an aptamer that binds to protein tyrosine kinase- 7 (PTK 7) that is overexpressed on many human cancer cells, we demonstrate that the 3 <b>D</b> <b>DNA</b> network significantly enhances the capture efficiency of lymphoblast CCRF-CEM cells over monovalent aptamers and antibodies, yet maintains a high purity of the captured cells. When incorporated in a herringbone microfluidic device, the 3 <b>D</b> <b>DNA</b> network not only possessed significantly higher capture efficiency than monovalent aptamers and antibodies, but also outperformed previously reported cell-capture microfluidic devices at high flow rates.

30|$|DNA/RNA origami, a new {{programmed}} {{nucleic acid}} assembly system, uses {{the nature of}} nucleic acid complementarity (i.e., the specificity of Watson–Crick base pairing) {{for the construction of}} nanostructures by means of the intermolecular interactions of DNA/RNA strands. 2 D and 3 D DNA/RNA nanostructures {{with a wide variety of}} shapes and defined sizes have been created with precise control over their geometries, periodicities and topologies [16, 128, 129]. Rothemund developed a versatile and simple ‘one-pot’ 2 <b>D</b> <b>DNA</b> origami method named ‘scaffolded DNA origami,’ which involves the folding of a long single strand of viral DNA into a DNA scaffold of a desired shape, such as a square, rectangle, triangle, five-pointed star, and even a smiley face using multiple short ‘staple’ strands [130]. To fabricate and stabilize various shapes of DNA tiles, crossover motifs have been designed through the reciprocal exchange of DNA backbones. Branched DNA tiles have also been constructed using sticky ends and crossover junction motifs, such as tensegrity triangles (rigid structures in a periodic-array form) and algorithmic self-assembled Sierpinski triangles (a fractal with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle). These DNA tiles can further self-assemble into NTs, helix bundles and complex DNA motifs and arrays [17]. 3 <b>D</b> <b>DNA</b> origami structures can be designed by extending the 2 <b>D</b> <b>DNA</b> origami system, e.g., by bundling dsDNAs, where the relative positioning of adjacent dsDNAs is controlled by crossovers or by folding 2 D origami domains into 3 D structures using interconnection strands [131]. 3 <b>D</b> <b>DNA</b> networks with such topologies as cubes, polyhedrons, prisms and buckyballs have also been fabricated using a minimal set of DNA strands based on junction flexibility and edge rigidity [17].|$|R

5000|$|RecBCD {{is unusual}} amongst helicases {{because it has}} two helicases that travel with {{different}} rates and because it can recognize and be altered by the Chi DNA sequence. [...] RecBCD avidly binds an end of linear double-stranded (<b>ds)</b> <b>DNA.</b> The RecD helicase travels on the strand with a 5' end at which the enzyme initiates unwinding, and RecB on the strand with a 3' end. RecB is slower than RecD, so that a single-stranded (ss) DNA loop accumulates ahead of RecB (Figure 2). This produces DNA structures with two ss tails (a shorter 3’ ended tail and a longer 5’ ended tail) and one ss loop (on the 3' ended strand) observed by electron microscopy. [...] The ss tails can anneal to produce a second ss loop complementary to the first one; such twin-loop structures were initially referred to as “rabbit ears.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{mechanism}} {{through which}} exon shuffling occurs {{is by the}} usage of helitrons. Helitron transposons were first discovered during studies of repetitive DNA segments of rice, worm and the thale crest genomes. Helitrons {{have been identified in}} all eukaryotic kingdoms, but the number of copies varies from species to species. Helitron encoded proteins are composed of a rolling-circle (RC) replication initiator (Rep) and a DNA helicase (Hel) domain. The Rep domain is involved in the catalytic reactions for endonuclelytic cleavage, DNA transfer and ligation. In addition this domain contains three motifs. The first motif is necessary for DNA binding. The second motif has two histidines and is involved in metal ion binding. Lastly the third motif has two tyrosines and catalyzes DNA cleavage and ligation. There are three models of gene capture by Helitrons: the 'read-through" [...] model 1 (RTM1), the 'read-through" [...] model 2 (RTM2) and a filler DNA model (FDNA). According to the RTM1 model an accidental [...] "malfunction" [...] of the replication terminator at the 3' end of the Helitron leads to transposition of genomic DNA. It is composed of the read-through Helitron element and its downstream genomic regions, flanked by a random DNA site, serving as a [...] "de novo" [...] RC terminator. According to the RTM2 model the 3' terminus of another Helitron serves as an RC terminator of transposition. This occurs after a malfunction of the RC terminator. Lastly in the FDNA model portions of genes or non-coding regions can accidentally serve as templates during repair of <b>ds</b> <b>DNA</b> breaks occurring in helitrons. Even though helitrons have been proven to be a very important evolutionary tool, the specific details for their mechanisms of transposition are yet to be defined. An example of evolution by using helitrons is the diversity commonly found in maize. Helitrons in maize cause a constant change of genic and nongenic regions by using transposable elements, leading to diversity among different maize lines.|$|E
