5|$|The most {{effective}} treatment for obesity is bariatric surgery. The types of procedures include laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, vertical-sleeve <b>gastrectomy,</b> and biliopancreatic diversion. Surgery for severe obesity {{is associated with}} long-term weight loss, improvement in obesity related conditions, and decreased overall mortality. One study found a weight loss of between 14% and 25% (depending {{on the type of}} procedure performed) at 10years, and a 29% reduction in all cause mortality when compared to standard weight loss measures. Complications occur in about 17% of cases and reoperation is needed in 7% of cases. Due to its cost and risks, researchers are searching for other effective yet less invasive treatments including devices that occupy space in the stomach.|$|E
25|$|Gastric {{bypass surgery}} not only reduces the gut's {{capacity}} for food but also dramatically lowers ghrelin levels compared to both lean controls {{and those that}} lost weight through dieting alone. However, studies are conflicting {{as to whether or}} not ghrelin levels return to nearly normal with gastric bypass patients in the long term after weight loss has stabilized. Bariatric surgeries involving vertical sleeve <b>gastrectomy</b> reduce plasma ghrelin levels by about 60% in the long term.|$|E

The proportion of <b>gastrectomies</b> with GCs was higher in patients in Vancouver, Canada, than in New York, and higher in Santiago de Chile than in Buenos Aires, despite the fact that these populations reside at approximately the same geographic latitude. Previous studies with the same material indicated that both the extension of intestinal metaplasia and the frequency of ciliated metaplasia were significantly higher in the Pacific than in the Atlantic basin. Hence, the difference in the frequencies of GCs appears to be a new indication that dissimilar environmental exposures in the two basins might have influenced the histological make-up of the gastric mucosa...|$|R

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldBACKGROUND: Extensive intestinal metaplasia (EIM) {{has been reported in}} <b>gastrectomies</b> from patients dwelling in the Pacific and Atlantic basins. AIMS: To compare all the results in an attempt to explain the findings. Method: All sections from 3, 421 <b>gastrectomies</b> were reviewed at various hospitals: 1946 in the Atlantic and 1475 in the Pacific basin. Sections with EIM showed IM encompassing one or more entire low power field (>or= 5 mm in length/section) in one or more section. RESULTS: In the Atlantic basin, EIM was present in 18. 8 % (153 of 814) of specimens with intestinal carcinoma (IC) and in 10. 3 % (65 of 630) of those with diffuse carcinoma (DC). In the Pacific basin, EIM was found in 62. 9 % (412 of 655) of <b>gastrectomies</b> with IC and in 33. 3 % (160 of 481) of those with DC. The numbers of specimens with EIM were significantly higher in the Pacific than in the Atlantic basin for both carcinoma phenotypes, particularly among elderly patients (>or= 60 years). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of <b>gastrectomies</b> with EIM was higher among populations at a higher gastric cancer risk than in those with a lower cancer risk. EIM was mostly associated with IC rather than DC or with miscellaneous gastric diseases (841 control <b>gastrectomies)</b> in both basins. The proportion of <b>gastrectomies</b> with EIM was significantly higher in Vancouver than in New York and in Santiago de Chile than in Buenos Aires, even though these populations reside at approximately the same geographical latitude, but in different basins.

25|$|Malnutrition, {{parenteral}} nutrition and malabsorption {{can lead to}} osteoporosis. Nutritional and gastrointestinal disorders that can predispose to osteoporosis include undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (both symptomatic and asymptomatic people), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, cystic fibrosis, surgery (after <b>gastrectomy,</b> intestinal bypass surgery or bowel resection) and severe liver disease (especially primary biliary cirrhosis). People with lactose intolerance or milk allergy may develop osteoporosis due to restrictions of calcium-containing foods. Individuals with bulimia can also develop osteoporosis.

2500|$|Surgical {{oncologist}} {{refers to}} a general surgical oncologist (a specialty of a general surgeon), but thoracic surgical oncologists, gynecologist and so forth can all be considered surgeons who specialize in treating cancer patients. [...] The importance of training surgeons who sub-specialize in cancer surgery lies in evidence, supported {{by a number of}} clinical trials, that outcomes in surgical cancer care are positively associated to surgeon volume—i.e., the more cancer cases a surgeon treats, the more proficient he or she becomes, and his or her patients experience improved survival rates as a result. This is another controversial point, but it is generally accepted—even as common sense—that a surgeon who performs a given operation more often, will achieve superior results when compared with a surgeon who rarely performs the same procedure. This is particularly true of complex cancer resections such as pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer, and <b>gastrectomy</b> with extended (D2) lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer.

2500|$|For example, it {{is still}} widely {{perceived}} that gastric bypass works by mechanical means, i.e. food restriction and/or malabsorption. Recent clinical and animal studies, however, have indicated that these long-held inferences about the mechanisms of Roux en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) may not be correct. A {{growing body of evidence}} suggests that profound changes in body weight and metabolism resulting from RYGB cannot be explained by simple mechanical restriction or malabsorption. One study in rats found that RYGB induced a 19% increase in total and a 31% increase in resting energy expenditure, an effect not exhibited in vertical sleeve <b>gastrectomy</b> rats. [...] In addition, pair-fed rats lost only 47% as much weight as their RYGB counterparts. Changes in food intake after RYGB only partially account for the RYGB-induced weight loss, and {{there is no evidence of}} clinically significant malabsorption of calories contributing to weight loss. Thus, it appears RYGB affects weight loss by altering the physiology of weight regulation and eating behavior rather than by simple mechanical restriction or malabsorption.|$|E

40|$|Background: Enhanced {{recovery}} {{after surgery}} (ERAS) protocols or fast-track (FT) programs enable a shorter hospital stay and lower complication rate.

However, little is known of the safety and effectiveness made by ERAS protocols combined with MIS for gastric cancer. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the safety and effectiveness made by FT programs and MIS in combination or alone. Methods: We summarized an 11 -year experience on gastric cancer patients undergoing elective laparotomy or minimally invasive gastric resection in standard cares (SC) or FT programs during January 2004 to December 2014. A total of 984 patients were enrolled and assigned into four groups: open <b>gastrectomies</b> (OG) with SC (OG + SC group, n = 167); OG with FT programs (OG + FT group, n = 277); laparoscopic <b>gastrectomies</b> (LG) with FT programs (LG + FT group, n = 248); and robot-assisted <b>gastrectomies</b> (RG) with FT programs (RG + FT group, n = 292). Patients' data were collected to evaluate the clinical outcome. The primary end point was the length of postoperative hospital stay. Results: The OG + SC group showed the longest postoperative hospital stay (mean: 12. 3 days, median: 11 days, interquartile range [IQR]: 6 – 16 days), while OG + FT, LG + FT, and RG + FT groups recovered faster (mean: 7. 4, 6. 4, and 6. 6 days, median: 6, 6, and 6 days, IQR: 3 – 9, 4 – 8, and 3 – 9 days, respectively, all P 0. 05).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{gastric cancer}} has been {{decreasing}} in incidence in many countries, {{it is still}} the second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Its prognosis is poor and depends, among other factors, on early diagnosis as well as on surgeon expertise. AIM: To compare the outcomes of gastric cancer patients treated at a university hospital by a general surgical team and later on by a gastric cancer surgical team. METHODS: Gastric cancer patients were separated into two groups according to whether they were treated by a general surgical team (group 1, n = 136; 1984 to 1993) or by gastric cancer team (group 2, n = 149; 1994 to 2003). Clinical and pathologic features and survival rates were assessed. RESULTS: During a 20 -year period, a decreased number of patients underwent surgical resection in the second period (94 % vs 86 %), a greater number of upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed resulting in an increased number of tumors diagnosed as stage I (5 % vs 22 %). Also, D 2 <b>gastrectomies</b> were more frequently performed instead of D 0 <b>gastrectomies</b> and negative surgical margins were adequate.

40|$|Background Since its {{introduction}} {{in the early}} 1990 s, minimally invasive gastro-oesophageal surgery for cancer has been growing in popularity. Despite this, published evidence on this type of technique is weak {{and its role in}} the management of gastric and oesophageal cancer remains controversial. Aims The aim of this thesis was to test the hypothesis that: minimally invasive gastro- oesophageal cancer surgery has superior outcomes compared to control studies of conventional open surgery; but current studies are methodologically inadequate to confirm this. Methods The first study (chapter 3) is a systematic review of the literature on minimally invasive gastro-oesophageal cancer surgery, outlining the differences between literature published in Eastern and Western countries The following 3 chapters outline and use a phase II surgical study to obtain data on minimally invasive gastro-oesophageal cancer (MIGOCS.) The MIGOCS group was set up in 2005 amongst UK surgeons. An online database was developed to enable data collection and comprises 5 sections: demo graphics; pre-operative staging and assessment; surgical intervention; post-operative course; pathology and clinical outcome. The first study is retrospective collecting data up to December 2006; the second study is prospective with data obtained between December 2006 - July 2008 from centres around the UK utilising the MIGOCS database. Chapter 7 involves analysis of the learning curve in laparoscopic gastro-oesophageal cancer surgery using CUSUM (continuous surveillance monitoring) assessment. By studying operative time at each centre, improvement or deterioration in quality were detected. Results The systematic review of minimally invasive gastro-oesophageal surgery consists in the majority of case reports, with no randomised controlled trials of oesophagectomies and 4 (low quality) randomised controlled trials of <b>gastrectomies.</b> It demonstrates a mortality and morbidity of 2. 3 % and 46. 2 % respectively for oesophagectomies; 0. 1 % and 12. 7 % respectively for <b>gastrectomies.</b> Data from this review suggests that the minimally invasive approach is beneficial compared to open surgery in terms of reduced mortality, respiratory complications, blood loss and quicker return to a good quality of life (but not reduced hospital stay as expected.) There are currently 60 MIGOCS member consultant surgeons from over 40 UK centres. The retrospective study obtained data from 7 UK centres with an overall mortality and morbidity of 6. 0 % and 57 % respectively for oesophagectomies and 7. 7 % and 13 % respectively for <b>gastrectomies.</b> The prospective study collected data from 7 UK centres, comprising a total of 258 minimally invasive oesophagectomies and 33 minimally invasive <b>gastrectomies.</b> Overall mortality and morbidity were 2. 5 % and 56. 6 % respectively for oesophagectomies and 10. 8 % and 27. 3 % respectively for <b>gastrectomies.</b> CUSUM analysis varied considerably between centres. The two larger volume centres however demonstrated an improvement in their operative time with experience, with a possible pateau at around 30 procedures. Conclusions Published data suggests that the minimally invasive approach to gastro-oesophageal cancer has advantages over conventional open surgery. Data collected in this thesis does not overwhelmingly support published evidence, but does demonstrate that this technique is both safe and feasible even during the early part of a surgeon's learning curve. It is the first study to provide an insight into outcomes of this type of surgery in a multi centre setting in the OK; and has made progress towards a randomised controlled trial. Weaknesses and Intepretation of Findings International literature on the subject of minimally invasive gastro-oesophageal surgery is at present limited and subject to both publication and selection bias. Data presented in this thesis is weakened by the number of operations recorded and centres involved in the studies. This impacts on any interpretation of findings. Further data collection, ideally {{in the form of a}} randomised controlled trial is therefore vital. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
