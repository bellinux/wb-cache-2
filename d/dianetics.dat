5|$|Campbell {{helped launch}} {{the career of}} science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard, and {{played a key role}} in the initial {{promotion}} of <b>Dianetics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several famous {{individuals}} {{became involved}} with <b>Dianetics.</b> Aldous Huxley received auditing from Hubbard himself; the poet Jean Toomer and the science fiction writers Theodore Sturgeon and A. E. van Vogt became trained <b>Dianetics</b> auditors. Van Vogt temporarily abandoned writing and became {{the head of the}} newly established Los Angeles branch of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation. Other branches were established in New York, Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Honolulu.|$|E
5|$|In {{another letter}} sent in March, Hubbard told the FBI that Northrup was a Communist and a drug addict, {{and offered a}} $10,000 reward to anyone who could resolve Northrup's {{problems}} {{through the application of}} <b>Dianetics</b> techniques.|$|E
5|$|After abandoning Kriya yoga, Salinger tried <b>Dianetics</b> (the {{forerunner of}} Scientology), even meeting its founder L. Ron Hubbard, but {{according}} to Claire he was quickly disenchanted with it. This was followed by an adherence {{to a number of}} spiritual, medical, and nutritional belief systems including an interest in Christian Science, Edgar Cayce, homeopathy, acupuncture, and macrobiotics.|$|E
5|$|Sara Elizabeth Bruce Northrup Hollister (April 8, 1924December 19, 1997) {{played a}} major role in the {{creation}} of <b>Dianetics,</b> which evolved into the religious movement Scientology. She was the second wife of science-fiction author L. Ron Hubbard, who would become the leader of the Church of Scientology.|$|E
5|$|According to the Church of Scientology, Hubbard {{produced}} some 65 million words on <b>Dianetics</b> and Scientology, contained in about 500,000 pages of written material, 3,000 recorded lectures and 100 films. His {{works of fiction}} included some 500 novels and short stories. Hubbard “published nearly 600 books, stories, and articles during his lifetime.” He sold over 23 million copies of fiction and 27 million copies of nonfiction.|$|E
5|$|She was {{assigned}} {{to try to stop}} the MTV Movie Awards from featuring a South Park satire which poked fun at Scientology and the film based on a book by its founder L. Ron Hubbard, titled Battlefield Earth. Christman repeatedly called the New York City office of MTV in an attempt to get them to stop the satire from airing. In the eventual broadcast, which ran June 8, 2000, the South Park character Cartman was shown using a Scientology personality test as toilet paper. Christman believed she had succeeded in her mission, for she thought that her efforts prevented the book <b>Dianetics</b> from being used by Cartman, instead of the personality test.|$|E
5|$|Diana Hubbard {{was born}} in London, the {{daughter}} of the founder of <b>Dianetics</b> and Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard. She was born Diana Meredith DeWolf Hubbard on September 24, 1952, to L. Ron Hubbard and his wife Mary Sue Hubbard. She was the first child born to Mary Sue and L. Ron Hubbard. She composed sonatas for piano at age 6. She attended the Royal Academy, where she took courses in ballet and music. In her early years as a teenager, she took executive courses in Scientology at Saint Hill Manor along with her brother, Quentin Hubbard. Her other siblings include Suzette and Arthur. At the age of 15, she left the Royal Academy, in order to serve within the Scientology organization and assist her father. During the bulk of her teenage years, she lived most of her life on her father's yacht, located in the Mediterranean. By age 16, she rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander within the elite Scientology group called the Sea Org. She became a spokesperson for the branch of the Church of Scientology within the United States in 1969. In 1979, Hubbard lived with her husband audiophile Jonathan Horwich and her daughter Roanne, in Clearwater, Florida. In 1980, she served as an executive within the Church of Scientology, and in 2001 she maintained a leadership position within the organization.|$|E
25|$|The e-meter was {{not part}} of the early days of <b>Dianetics</b> and Scientology. Auditing was {{composed}} of conversation and not led by a mechanical device. Hubbard introduced an E-meter prototype during the 1952 Philadelphia Doctorate Course but did not introduce his transistorized version after several years later. The E-meter became “the principal material artifact” of <b>Dianetics</b> and Scientology from the 1960s onward.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} {{footnote to}} Campbell's regime is {{his contribution to}} the rise of L. Ron Hubbard's religion Scientology. Hubbard was considered a promising science fiction writer and a protégé of Campbell, who published Hubbard's first articles about <b>Dianetics</b> and his new religion. As Campbell's reign as editor of Astounding progressed, Campbell gave more attention to ideas like Hubbard's, writing editorials in support of <b>Dianetics.</b> Though Astounding continued to have a loyal fanbase, readers started turning to other magazines to find science fiction stories.|$|E
25|$|On May 8, 2010, Farrakhan {{publicly}} {{announced his}} embrace of <b>Dianetics</b> and has actively encouraged Nation of Islam members to undergo auditing from the Church of Scientology.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dianetics</b> postulates {{that there}} is a part of our psyche called the {{reactive}} mind, and that most of our mental and physical problems are psychosomatic, thus they can be solved by eliminating this portion of our minds. This mental state of self-mastery is called Clear.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Louis Farrakhan {{rejected}} Warith Deen Mohammed's {{leadership and}} re-established the Nation of Islam {{on the original}} model. He took over the Nation of Islam's headquarters Temple, Mosque Maryam (Mosque #2) in Chicago, Illinois. Since 2010, under Farrakhan, members have been strongly encouraged to study <b>Dianetics,</b> and the Nation claims it has trained 1055 auditors.|$|E
25|$|According to the Church of Scientology, {{the concept}} for the thetan was first {{discovered}} in the early 1950s by L. Ron Hubbard, drawing on reports by <b>Dianetics</b> practitioners of past-life experiences. Although the term is comparable to a soul, a thetan can be connected to multiple people over time. An important goal in Scientology is to become one with the thetan as an Operating Thetan.|$|E
25|$|Some {{critics of}} <b>Dianetics</b> and Scientology {{assert that the}} Scientology {{concepts}} associated with the E-meter and its use are regarded by the scientific and medical communities as pseudoscience, and that the E-meter has never been subjected to clinical trials as a therapeutic tool. Nevertheless, by 1972, more than 1500 articles on electrodermal activity (EDA) had been published in professional publications, and today EDA {{is regarded as a}} popular method for investigating human psychophysiological phenomena.|$|E
25|$|In the Church of Scientology doctrine, supernatural or superhuman {{abilities}} are a recurring subject, appearing throughout Scientology and <b>Dianetics</b> materials, {{from the most}} basic introductory texts to the highest-level Operating Thetan information. Virtually all of these concepts were authored by the church's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, and have not been subjected to testing outside the Church. The Church of Scientology have never offered any externally accepted, empirical, peer-reviewed evidence that Scientologists possess any of these abilities.|$|E
25|$|Twitchell's {{first known}} {{connection}} with L. Ron Hubbard (also a US Naval Reserve Officer during WW2 and pulp fiction author) was around 1950 during the <b>Dianetics</b> period. He also investigated {{a number of}} diverse spiritual movements and became an avid reader of spiritual, philosophical, religious and occult books at the Library. In 1950, he joined Premananda Giri's Self-Realization Church of Absolute Monism, an offshoot of Paramahamsa Yogananda's Self-Realization Fellowship. He lived {{on the grounds of}} the church, and edited its periodical, The Mystic Cross. He was asked to leave the church in July 1955, due to personal misconduct. A few months later he formally separated from his wife, who stayed on at the fellowship for a time. Their divorced was finalized in 1960.|$|E
25|$|The {{first edition}} of this book {{prompted}} many curious letters from irate readers. The most violent letters came from Reichians, furious because the book considered orgonomy alongside such (to them) outlandish cults as <b>dianetics.</b> Dianeticians, of course, felt the same about orgonomy. I heard from homeopaths who were insulted to find themselves in company with such frauds as osteopathy and chiropractic, and one chiropractor in Kentucky “pitied” me because I had turned my spine on God’s greatest gift to suffering humanity. Several admirers of Dr. Bates favored me with letters so badly typed that I suspect the writers were in urgent need of strong spectacles. Oddly enough, most of these correspondents objected to one chapter only, thinking all the others excellent.|$|E
25|$|When Gresham {{received}} {{a large sum}} for the movie rights to Nightmare Alley, {{the family moved to}} an old mansion with acreage in the New York countryside, where Davidman began to write her second novel, Weeping Bay and Gresham also started his second novel, Limbo Tower. In 1948, they became members of the Pleasant Plains Presbyterian Church. Gresham had at first similar Christian convictions as Joy but soon rejected them; he continued to have extramarital affairs and developed an interest in tarot cards and the I Ching. Both experimented with L. Ron Hubbard's theories of <b>Dianetics</b> and 'audited' each other and friends. The couple became estranged, even though they continued to live together. After an introduction by a fellow American writer, Chad Walsh, Davidman began a correspondence with C. S. Lewis in 1950.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard {{described}} <b>Dianetics</b> as “the hidden {{source of}} all psychosomatic ills and human aberration” when he introduced <b>Dianetics</b> {{to the world in}} the 1950s. He further claimed that “skills have been developed for their invariable cure.” <b>Dianetics</b> was duly launched in Astounding's May 1950 issue and on May 9, Hubbard's companion book [...] was published by Hermitage House. Hubbard abandoned freelance writing in order to promote <b>Dianetics,</b> writing several books about it in the next decade, delivering an estimated 4,000 lectures while founding <b>Dianetics</b> research organizations. The etymological origin of the word <b>Dianetics</b> are the words dia, meaning [...] "through" [...] and nous, meaning [...] "soul." [...] Hubbard defined it as “a spiritual healing technology” and “an organized science of thought.” ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Dianetics</b> {{became an}} {{immediate}} bestseller {{when it was}} published in May 1950. Only two months later, over 55,000 copies had been sold and 500 <b>Dianetics</b> groups had been set up across the United States. The <b>Dianetics</b> Foundation was making a huge amount of money, but problems were already evident: money was pouring out as fast as it was coming in, due to lax financial management and Hubbard's own free spending. Northrup recalled that [...] "he used to ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Dianetics</b> {{appeared}} {{to be on the}} edge of total collapse. However, it was saved by Don Purcell, a millionaire businessman and Dianeticist who agreed to support a new Foundation in Wichita, Kansas. Their collaboration ended after less than a year when they fell out over the future direction of <b>Dianetics.</b> The Wichita Foundation became financially nonviable after a court ruled that it was liable for the unpaid debts of its defunct predecessor in Elizabeth, N.J. The ruling prompted Purcell and the other directors of the Wichita Foundation to file for voluntary bankruptcy in February 1952. Hubbard resigned immediately and accused Purcell of having been bribed by the American Medical Association to destroy <b>Dianetics.</b> Hubbard established a [...] "Hubbard College" [...] {{on the other side of}} town where he continued to promote <b>Dianetics</b> while fighting Purcell in the courts over the Foundation's intellectual property.|$|E

500|$|The Church of Scientology {{rejects the}} {{official}} record and insists that Hubbard had {{a second set of}} records that the U.S. Navy has concealed. According to the Church's chief spokesman, if it was true that Hubbard had not been injured, [...] "the injuries that he handled by the use of <b>Dianetics</b> procedures were never handled, because they were injuries that never existed; therefore, <b>Dianetics</b> is based on a lie; therefore, Scientology is based on a lie." ...|$|E
500|$|The 1950s saw Scientology growing steadily. Hubbard finally {{achieved}} {{victory over}} Don Purcell in 1954 when the latter, worn out by constant litigation, handed the copyrights of <b>Dianetics</b> back to Hubbard. Most of the formerly independent Scientology and <b>Dianetics</b> groups were either {{driven out of}} business or were absorbed into Hubbard's organizations. Hubbard marketed Scientology through medical claims, such as attracting polio sufferers by presenting the Church of Scientology as a scientific research foundation investigating polio cases. One advertisement during this period stated: ...|$|E
500|$|Winter {{submitted}} {{a paper on}} <b>Dianetics</b> to the Journal of the American Medical Association and the American Journal of Psychiatry but both journals rejected it. Hubbard and his collaborators decided to announce <b>Dianetics</b> in Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction instead. In an editorial, Campbell said: [...] "Its power is almost unbelievable; it proves the mind not only can but does rule the body completely; following the sharply defined basic laws set forth, physical ills such as ulcers, asthma and arthritis can be cured, as can all other psychosomatic ills." [...] The birth of Hubbard's second daughter Alexis Valerie, delivered by Winter on March 8, 1950, came {{in the middle of}} the preparations to launch <b>Dianetics.</b> A [...] "Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation" [...] was established in April 1950 in Elizabeth, New Jersey, with Hubbard, Sara, Winter and Campbell on the board of directors.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard {{played a}} very {{active role in the}} <b>Dianetics</b> boom, writing, lecturing and {{training}} auditors. Many of those who knew him spoke of being impressed by his personal charisma. Jack Horner, who became a <b>Dianetics</b> auditor in 1950, later said, [...] "He was very impressive, dedicated and amusing. The man had tremendous charisma; you just wanted to hear every word he had to say and listen for any pearl of wisdom." [...] Isaac Asimov recalled in his autobiography how, at a dinner party, he, Robert Heinlein, L. Sprague de Camp and their wives [...] "all sat as quietly as pussycats and listened to Hubbard. He told tales with perfect aplomb and in complete paragraphs." [...] As Atack comments, he was [...] "a charismatic figure who compelled the devotion of those around him". Christopher Evans described the personal qualities that Hubbard brought to <b>Dianetics</b> and Scientology: ...|$|E
500|$|The Church of Scientology {{says that}} Hubbard's key {{breakthrough}} {{in the development of}} <b>Dianetics</b> was made at Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in Oakland, California. According to the Church, ...|$|E
500|$|Only {{a couple}} of months later, he {{highlighted}} Northrup to his staff as a participant in a [...] "full complete covert operation" [...] mounted against <b>Dianetics</b> and Scientology by a [...] "Totalitarian Communistic" [...] enemy. In a memo of December 2, 1969, he wrote that the operation had started with bad reviews of <b>Dianetics,</b> [...] "pushed then by the Sara Komkovadamanov [...] (alias Northrup) [...] "divorce" [...] actions ... At the back of it was Miles Hollister (psychology student) Sara Komkosadamanov [...] (housekeeper at the place nuclear physicists stayed near Caltech) ..." ...|$|E
500|$|The author goes on {{to explain}} how {{individuals}} were attracted to <b>Dianetics,</b> the precursor to Scientology. Wallis notes, [...] " [...] offered a rationale for failure in social mobility and in social interaction. It provided an explanation in terms of traumatic incidents {{in which the individual}} had been unwittingly involved, and thereby relieved him of responsibility for his failure." [...] Scientologists who participated in a questionnaire for Wallis' research identified areas of their life that they hoped Scientology would improve, including: loneliness, financial difficulties, marital issues, other interpersonal relationships, psychological problems, and physical illness. Wallis describes Hubbard's thought process to turn his methodology of <b>Dianetics</b> into a religion, noting, [...] "Hubbard's theory and techniques had been moving increasingly in this direction". Wallis notes how Scientology became a focus for those previously involved in the <b>Dianetics</b> movement. Wallis points out that Hubbard instructed members of Scientology not to immediately tell new followers about methodologies that might be less familiar to some, such as belief in the existence of prior lives.|$|E
500|$|In 1949, Campbell {{also became}} {{interested}} in <b>Dianetics.</b> He wrote of L. Ron Hubbard's initial article in Astounding that [...] "It is, I assure you in full and absolute sincerity, {{one of the most}} important articles ever published." [...] He also claimed to have successfully used dianetic techniques himself.|$|E
500|$|L. Ron Hubbard {{created a}} form of therapy known as <b>Dianetics,</b> which he {{promoted}} as a scientific, not religious, teaching. Until the early 1950s, he had a negative view of organized religions, but thereafter discussed spiritual topics. In these teachings, he identified subconscious memories of past events, which he called [...] "engrams", as causes of human dissatisfaction. By 1950, {{he had begun to}} ponder past lives, believing that they could be recalled; he attempted to use these recollections to develop a comprehensive narrative of the universe. He founded the Church of Scientology in 1953, advancing his beliefs as religious doctrines. The church was distinct from Dianetics-based groups but incorporated some of their views. Hubbard saw <b>Dianetics</b> as focused on the physical body but viewed Scientology as a way to address spiritual matters.|$|E
500|$|In late 1948 Hubbard and Sara {{moved to}} Savannah, Georgia. Here, Scientology sources say, he [...] "volunteer {{his time in}} {{hospitals}} and mental wards, saving the lives of patients with his counseling techniques". Hubbard began {{to make the first}} public mentions of what was to become <b>Dianetics.</b> His first thoughts on the subject were compiled in a short book called The Original Thesis, which contained basic conclusions about human aberrations and handling them with auditing. His first published articles in <b>Dianetics</b> were “Terra Incognita: The Mind” in the Explorer Club Journal and another one that impacted people more heavily in Astounding Science Fiction. The positive public response to these articles led Hubbard to expand it to Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health. Scientologists consider the publication of the volume in May 9, 1950 as “a seminal event of the century.” ...|$|E
500|$|Northrup {{played a}} {{significant}} role in the development of <b>Dianetics,</b> Hubbard's [...] "modern science of mental health", between 1948 and 1951. She was Hubbard's personal auditor and along with Hubbard, one of the seven members of the <b>Dianetics</b> Foundation's Board of Directors. However, their marriage was deeply troubled; Hubbard was responsible for a prolonged campaign of domestic violence against her and kidnapped both her and her infant daughter. Hubbard spread allegations that she was a Communist secret agent and repeatedly denounced her to the FBI. [...] The FBI declined to take any action, characterizing Hubbard as a [...] "mental case". The marriage broke up in 1951 and prompted lurid headlines in the Los Angeles newspapers. She subsequently married one of Hubbard's former employees, Miles Hollister, and moved to Hawaii and later Massachusetts, where she died in 1997.|$|E
