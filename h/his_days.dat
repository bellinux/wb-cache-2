5|$|Adolphus Frederick Alexander Woodford (1821–1887) was {{the eldest}} son of Alexander George Woodford, a career soldier who was already a hero of Waterloo, and would rise to Field Marshal, ending <b>his</b> <b>days</b> in command of Chelsea Hospital. After a short stay in the Coldstream Guards, Adolphus entered the Anglican Church, having the living of Swillington from 1847–1872. On leaving the Army, he also became a Freemason, rising to become Grand Chaplain in 1863, {{commuting}} from Yorkshire to his London duties.|$|E

He also authored, co-authored, and edited several books. He promoted American football and advocated for retired professional football players. Kemp was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 by President Barack Obama.|$|E
5|$|As was {{the case}} with his grandfather, Sultan Ibrahim, Sultan Iskandar's {{independent}} mindset resulted in strained relations with the Malaysian federal government on numerous occasions. This was more so during <b>his</b> <b>days</b> as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, whereby a number of notable public incidents involved Sultan Iskandar. Nevertheless, Sultan Iskandar was reputed to show great concern to his subjects, and was held in high esteem by many of his subjects–particularly the Malays and Orang Aslis.|$|E
25|$|Druce was {{a rather}} unorthodox batsman focused chiefly on hitting, and for <b>his</b> <b>day</b> <b>his</b> hitting on the leg-side was {{exceptional}} in quality. Although {{he was not a}} pure slogger, his defence on sticky wickets was not the equal of the best batsmen of <b>his</b> <b>day,</b> as shown in August 1895.|$|R

5|$|Before {{creating}} Shaman King, Takei, {{an assistant}} of Nobuhiro Watsuki's Rurouni Kenshin, exchanged {{ideas about the}} series with the other assistants. As a colleague of Watsuki, he worked primarily as a manga assistant, only focusing on his own projects during <b>his</b> <b>days</b> off. He was influenced by street art from hip-hop and rap culture, which is apparent in his manga artwork. For drawing, he used calligraphy inks and pen nibs. When illustrating, he used Copic brand color markers.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} Yale University, but by his {{own account}} had problems adjusting to the college, and failed out twice. Among the influential teachers from <b>his</b> <b>days</b> in New Haven was Professor H. Bradford Westerfield, whom Cheney repeatedly credited with having helped to shape his approach to foreign policy. He later attended the University of Wyoming, where he earned both a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Arts in political science. He subsequently started, but did not finish, doctoral studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.|$|E
5|$|He {{lived on}} for four more years, {{spending}} <b>his</b> <b>days</b> in his palace gardens. He saw his tetrarchic system fail, torn by the selfish ambitions of his successors. He heard of Maximian's third {{claim to the}} throne, his forced suicide, his damnatio memoriae. In his own palace, statues and portraits of his former companion emperor were torn down and destroyed. Deep in despair and illness, Diocletian may have committed suicide. He died on 3 December 312.|$|E

5|$|Maredudd ap Rhys (died 1239) {{was also}} given as a hostage, but was less {{fortunate}} than Hywel. He was blinded by King Henry after {{the failure of}} the invasion of Wales in 1165, and became known as Maredudd Ddall (Maredudd the Blind). He ended <b>his</b> <b>days</b> as a monk at Whitland Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Middleton {{stayed at}} LSU until 1942, {{describing}} <b>his</b> <b>days</b> as the comptroller of LSU as long days {{that he would}} not want to relive, but after the first year he found both the work and his association with Hebert, Borth and Hornbeak to be satisfying and rewarding. He felt that during this period of time, from 1939 to 1941, he was able to make his greatest contribution to an institution that had been very good to him in the past.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June 1815, {{four days}} after Waterloo, Napoleon abdicated. Lafayette {{arranged}} for the former emperor's passage to America, but the British prevented this, and Napoleon ended <b>his</b> <b>days</b> {{on the island of}} Saint Helena. The Chamber of Representatives, before it dissolved, appointed Lafayette to a peace commission that was ignored by the victorious allies who occupied much of France, with the Prussians taking over La Grange as a headquarters. Once the Prussians left in late 1815, Lafayette returned to his house, a private citizen again.|$|E

On February 24, 2016, Nakajima picked up the biggest win of his career by defeating Minoru Suzuki in the main event of Noah's show in Korakuen Hall. As a result, Nakajima was granted a shot at the GHC Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated by Takashi Sugiura on March 19.|$|E

5|$|Among {{his most}} notable romantic relationships, Sarsgaard dated burlesque dancer Dita Von Teese and model and actress Shalom Harlow. Early in his film career, he dated {{photographer}} Malerie Marder, {{a close friend}} from <b>his</b> <b>days</b> attending Bard College, who had featured Sarsgaard in some of her early work. Sarsgaard began a romantic relationship with actress Maggie Gyllenhaal, the sister of his close friend Jake Gyllenhaal, in 2002. In April 2006, they announced their engagement, and on May 2, 2009, they married in a small ceremony in Brindisi, Italy. They have two daughters, Ramona Sarsgaard, born October 3, 2006, and Gloria Ray Sarsgaard, born April 19, 2012. The family lives in Brooklyn, New York City, New York.|$|E
5|$|Bonifácio was {{dismissed}} {{from his position}} in December 1833 and replaced by another guardian. PedroII spent <b>his</b> <b>days</b> studying, with only two hours set aside for amusements. Intelligent, {{he was able to}} acquire knowledge with great ease. However, the hours of study were strenuous and the preparation for his role as monarch was demanding. He had few friends of his age and limited contact with his sisters. All that coupled with the sudden loss of his parents gave PedroII an unhappy and lonely upbringing. The environment in which he was raised turned him into a shy and needy person who saw books as a refuge and retreat from the real world.|$|E
5|$|Bruce Bowen Jr. {{was born}} in Merced, California as son of Bruce Bowen Sr. and Dietra Campbell. Bowen had a {{problematic}} childhood growing up in Merced, because, he claims, his mother took drugs and even sold the family TV to feed her habit. Bruce Jr. spent <b>his</b> <b>days</b> playing basketball and eventually became {{a star in the}} local West Fresno Edison High School squad. He then played four seasons at Cal State Fullerton, appearing in 101 games, and averaged 11.4 points and 5.8 rebounds per game. After averaging 16.3 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 36.6 minutes in 27 games as a senior in 1992–93, he was named to the All-Big West Conference First Team. Bowen ranks 12th on the Titans' all-time list in career points (1,155) and is seventh all-time in rebounds (559).|$|E

5|$|Buchanan rarely {{consulted}} Breckinridge {{when making}} patronage appointments, and meetings {{between the two}} were infrequent. When Breckinridge and Buchanan endorsed the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state instead of allowing the people to vote, they managed to alienate most Northern Democrats, including Douglas. This disagreement ended plans for Breckinridge, Douglas, and Minnesota's Henry Mower Rice to build {{a series of three}} elaborate, conjoined row houses in which to live during their time in Washington, D.C. In November 1857, after Breckinridge found alternative lodging in Washington, he sold a slave woman and her young infant which, according to historian James C. Klotter, probably ended <b>his</b> <b>days</b> as a slaveholder. When Breckinridge did not travel to Illinois to campaign for Douglas's re-election to the Senate and gave him only a lukewarm endorsement, relations between them worsened.|$|E
5|$|Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) {{talks to}} the others {{to try to get}} a sense of Shane's actions. He later speaks to Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) about Shane's erratic behavior, his {{suspicion}} that Shane had killed Otis to escape a walker horde, and his fear Shane may kill someone else soon. As Beth's condition worsen, Lori asks Daryl (Norman Reedus) to drive into town to check on Rick, but Daryl refuses, saying <b>his</b> <b>days</b> of searching for someone are over. Lori opts to go alone, but en route, her car hits a walker and is overturned.|$|E
5|$|During <b>his</b> <b>days</b> as the Agong, Sultan Iskandar {{was often}} seen in public {{carrying}} a pistol in his waistband, which drew considerable concern and discomfort from the Malaysian public due to his past record of criminal offences. He was also reputed to have led a flamboyant lifestyle, which also drew similar scepticism. He was also {{known to be a}} motorbike enthusiast; documentaries on national patriotism would feature Sultan Iskandar, the then-Agong, riding out on a police motorbike and his flamboyant appearance during a few public ceremonies. These documentaries drew criticisms from the Malaysian public, who felt that the television clips of Sultan Iskandar were inappropriate for its theme and national image.|$|E
25|$|As in his {{commentary}} on the Tanakh, Rashi frequently illustrates {{the meaning of the}} text using analogies to the professions, crafts, and sports of <b>his</b> <b>day.</b> He also translates difficult Hebrew or Aramaic words into the spoken French language of <b>his</b> <b>day,</b> giving latter-day scholars a window into the vocabulary and pronunciation of Old French.|$|R
