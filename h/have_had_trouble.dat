5|$|James Spotila et al. (1991) {{concludes that}} the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to {{maintain}} high metabolic rates because {{they would not have}} been able to release enough heat. They assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat. Some scientists state that the heart would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain. Others suggest that the near-horizontal posture of the head and neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it would not have been elevated.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain of}} Allosaurus, as {{interpreted}} from spiral CT scanning of an endocast, was {{more consistent with}} crocodilian brains {{than those of the}} other living archosaurs, birds. The structure of the vestibular apparatus indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal, as opposed to strongly tipped up or down. The structure of the inner ear was like that of a crocodilian, and so Allosaurus probably could have heard lower frequencies best, and would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> with subtle sounds. The olfactory bulbs were large and seem to have been well suited for detecting odors, although the area for evaluating smells was relatively small.|$|E
5|$|Large {{numbers of}} statues of Amenhotep have been found, {{but they are}} mostly from the Ramesside period and relate to his {{continuing}} funerary cult, made for his posthumous funerary cult. This makes study {{of the art of}} his reign difficult. Based upon his few authentic statues, it appears that Amenhotep continued the practice of copying Middle Kingdom styles. Art in the early 18th dynasty was particularly {{similar to that of the}} early Middle Kingdom, and the statues produced by Amenhotep I clearly copied those of Mentuhotep II and Senusret I. The two types are so similar that modern Egyptologists <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> telling the two apart.|$|E

5|$|After Edgehill, Rupert asked Charles for a swift cavalry {{attack on}} London before the Earl of Essex's army could return. The King's senior counsellors, however, {{urged him to}} advance slowly on the capital with the whole army. By the time they arrived, the city had {{organised}} defences against them. Some argue that, in delaying, the Royalists had perhaps lost their best chance of winning the war, although others have argued that Rupert's proposed attack would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> penetrating a hostile London. Instead, early in 1643, Rupert began to clear the South-West, taking Cirencester in February before moving further against Bristol, a key port. Rupert took Bristol in July with his brother Maurice using Cornish forces and was appointed Governor of the city. By mid-1643 Rupert had become so well known {{that he was an}} issue in any potential peace accommodation—Parliament was seeking to see him punished as part of any negotiated solution, and the presence of Rupert at the court, close to the King during the negotiations, was perceived as a bellicose statement in itself.|$|E

25|$|Two Operational Plans (OPLAN) were considered. OPLAN 316 {{envisioned a}} full {{invasion}} of Cuba by Army and Marine units, {{supported by the}} Navy following Air Force and naval airstrikes. However, Army units in the US would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> fielding mechanized and logistical assets, and the US Navy could not supply enough amphibious shipping to transport even a modest armored contingent from the Army.|$|E

25|$|His {{opponent}} Roy Jenkins {{believed that}} he would not have been a great chancellor – with youthful memories of the unemployment of the 1930s and adult experience of the lower levels of the postwar era Macleod thought unemployment higher than 300,000 was too high, and so would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> adjusting to the new economic realities of the 1970s – but still would have been a better chancellor than Barber. He was already ill and old for his years, so would probably not have succeeded Heath as party leader, but might have prevented Thatcher from doing so.|$|E
500|$|Lin {{worked to}} improve his jump shot during the offseason by abandoning the {{shooting}} form he had used since the eighth grade. He also increased his strength, doubling the weight he could squat (from [...] to [...] ) and almost tripling the number of pull-ups {{that he could do}} (from 12 to 30). He increased his body weight from [...] to —including [...] of muscle—added [...] to his standing vertical jump and [...] to his running vertical jump, and improved his lateral quickness by 32percent. Due to the lockout, he {{never got a chance to}} workout for new Warriors coach Mark Jackson. On the first day of training camp on December 9, 2011, the Warriors waived Lin. He was a favorite of Lacob, but the Warriors were freeing up salary cap space to make an offer to restricted free agent center DeAndre Jordan; Lin was due to make almost $800,000 that would have become fully guaranteed on February 10, 2012. The San Francisco Chronicle said Lin would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> beating out rookie guard Charles Jenkins.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Office fansite [...] "OfficeTally", Celotta said she and Lieberstein had only about one weekend to finish the script and distribute it to the actors, so there was little discussion about their individual volleyball abilities. Once the scripts were circulated, the writers learned that Jenna Fischer was {{not very good at}} volleyball and had trouble making certain motions with her arm over her head due to a previous injury. As a result, director Ken Kwapis arranged for stunt doubles to perform some of the volleyball moves; a handful of scenes were also shot with Pam doing an overhead motion with the ball being added later using computer-generated imagery. The opening credits were trimmed down to ten seconds and no post-credits scene was used {{in order to keep the}} episode within the network-mandated 21 minutes and 35 seconds. The producers considered making the episode an hour long like other season finales from past seasons, like [...] "The Job" [...] and [...] "Goodbye, Toby", but they found they did not have enough plot points to conclude in [...] "Company Picnic" [...] and would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> filling a full hour.|$|E

2500|$|Despite this, {{the summary}} {{section of the}} Battelle Institute's final report {{declared}} it was [...] "highly improbable {{that any of the}} reports of unidentified aerial objects... represent observations of technological developments outside the range of present-day knowledge." [...] A number of researchers, including Dr. Bruce Maccabee, who extensively reviewed the data, have noted that the conclusions of the analysts were usually at odds with their own statistical results, displayed in 240 charts, tables, graphs and maps. Some conjecture that the analysts may simply <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> accepting their own results or may have written the conclusions to satisfy the new political climate within Blue Book following the Robertson Panel.|$|E
2500|$|New antitank {{guns and}} ammunition. The {{standard}} German antitank gun, the 37mm Pak 36, {{was capable of}} penetrating the armour of all 1940 British tanks except the Matilda and Valentine. Armour-piercing ballistic capped (tungsten-cored) ammunition (Pzgr. 40) for 37mm Pak 36 had become available {{in time for the}} invasion. The 37mm Pzgr.40 would still <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> penetrating the Matilda II’s armour so the first echelon units replaced theirs with French or Czechoslovak 47mm guns (which weren't much better). [...] The Pak 36 began to be replaced by the 50mm Pak 38 in mid-1940. The Pak 38, which could penetrate a Matilda's armour, would probably have seen action first with Sea Lion as it would have been issued initially to the Waffen-SS and the Heers elite units, and all those units were in the Sea Lion force. [...] These included the SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler regiment, the Großdeutschland regiment, 2 mountain, 2 Jäger, 2 Fallschirmjäger, 4 panzer, and 2 motorised divisions. In addition, the 7th Infantry division was considered {{one of the best in}} the Heer, and the 35th almost as good.|$|E
