40|$|The {{effects of}} {{high-pressure}} (HP) treatment on some physicochemical and functional properties of soy protein isolates (SPI) were investigated. Surface hydrophobicity (H o), free sulfhydryl (SH) content, {{differential scanning calorimetry}} characteristics, protein solubility, emulsifying activities, and heat-induced <b>gelling</b> <b>property</b> were evaluated. HP treatment at 200 - 600 MPa resulted in a slight but gradual decline in solubility, and a significant (P< 0. 05) increase in H o. Free SH content of SPI was significantly (P< 0. 05) increased after HP treatment at 200 MPa, but was gradually decreased with further increase in pressure. HP treatment at 200 - 600 MPa significantly (P< 0. 05) increased emulsification activity index, but decreased emulsion stability index. The heat-induced <b>gelling</b> <b>property</b> of SPI was also decreased by HP treatment. The influence of HP treatment on these properties was closely dependent on the protein concentration at which the SPI solutions were HP-treated. These results suggest that HP treatment {{could be used to}} modify the properties of soy proteins by appropriate selection of pressure level and protein concentration. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

But the increase of the yield of agar, <b>gelling</b> <b>property</b> of the agar produced tends to decrease, due to inevitable partial hydrolysis of agar. An alternative method of extraction was available, in which seaweeds were soaked with acid solution followed by extraction under neutral condition. Using this method, high yields and high <b>gelling</b> <b>property</b> were obtained. This experiment investigated the effect of acetic acid concentration on yield, volumetric mass transfer coefficient (kca), and equilibrium constant (H) in extraction process.

40|$|Proteins {{extracted}} from defatted oats were chemically modified by acylation (succinylation and acetylation), potassium linoleate treatment or partial hydrolysis with trypsin. Total {{essential amino acid}} content was slightly lowered by acetylation, but unaffected by succinylation. Gel filtration chromatography showed some dissociation of oat polypeptides by succinylation, while trypsin hydrolysis caused considerable breakdown of the protein.

40|$|Variations in {{chemical}} and gelling characteristics of hybrid carrageenan extracted from Mastocarpus stellatus seaweeds are studied {{in order to}} explore potential links between the seaweeds life phase, the seaweeds postharvest storage duration and the phycocolloids properties. Chemical structures of phycocolloids were assessed by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Rheological properties of hybrid carrageenans, such as intrinsic viscosity ([η]), gel elasticity (G 0), gel setting temperature (Tg) and gel melting temperature (Tm), were measured with a stress rheometer. Seasonal variation {{in the degree of}} sulphates of native extracts and in their corresponding <b>gelling</b> <b>properties</b> is found. The minimum in <b>gelling</b> <b>properties</b> coincides with a minimum of fructified gametophytes in populations harvested during the cold season.

Nimesulide, a local anti-inflammatory and anesthetic drug used {{for the treatment of}} acute and chronic pain, has a short duration of action and a long-acting single-dose injection would be of clinical importance. Thus a poloxamer 407 gel applied intramuscularly could prolong the release and action of nimesulide. In this study, aqueous gels with nimesulide, containing three different concentrations of Poloxamer 407, were prepared. Viscosity measurements were performed by rheologial studies to obtain the optimal sol-gel transition temperature. Poloxamer 407 gels are pseudoplastic and viscoelastic materials, which have an elastic modulus (G'), characteristic of the solid, and a viscous modulus (G''), characteristic of the liquid material. Moreover, being pseudoplastic gels, when they are deformed by shearing, their viscosity decreases. Increase of the polymer concentration increased the viscosity of the gels, which could affect the releasing process of nimesulide. Furthermore, the presence of nimesulide led to a lowering of the sol-gel transition temperature.

In this research, the difference in crystallization and gelling behavior between sunflower wax (SW), a high melting wax, and BEW, a low-melting wax, in rice bran oil (RBO) was investigated. The difference in melting and crystallization temperatures can be explained by the different chemical composition (long-chain wax esters in SWand shortchain fatty acids in BEW). The heterogeneity in crystal habits (unidirectional platelets versus microcrystalline particles) and polymorphism (orthorhombic versus hexagonal) are responsible for the varying gel strength and hardness of the respective SWand BEW-oleogels.

30|$|Enzymes {{required}} for the breakdown of pectin can be majorly classified into three categories as protopectinases (involved in breaking insoluble protopectin and results in soluble polymerized pectin), depolymerizing enzymes ({{required for}} breaking down α(1 [*]→[*] 4) glycosidic linkages of pectin) and esterases ({{required for the}} de-esterification and de-acetylation of pectin) (Gonzalez and Rosso 2011). Pectinolytic enzymes are widely observed among plants, bacterial and fungal species {{and most of the}} pectin methyl esterases can be divided based on their optimum pH; bacteria and plant PME exhibit an optimum pH range between 6 and 8 and PME secreted by fungi exhibit a pH 4 – 6 (Gonzalez and Rosso 2011; Jayani et al. 2005). Pectin-degrading enzymes have attained high commercial importance since early 1930 s in wine and fruit juice industries; pectinolytic enzymes secreted by Aspergillus species are highly used in industries (Alkorta et al. 1998). Pectin present in vegetable tissues and majorly in fruits contains complex hetero polysaccharides at a molecular weight ranging between 25 and 360  kDa. Calcium and magnesium pectate forms the major constituent of the plant cell walls especially in middle lamella (Jayani et al. 2005). The <b>gelling</b> <b>property</b> of pectin majorly employed in the food industries is directly dependent on its degree of esterification; pectins with higher degree of esterification gel around pH 3.0 in the presence of sugar, whereas pectins with low degree of esterification gel in the presence of calcium ions under wide pH ranges and with or without sugar (Fu and Rao 1999, 2001; Gonzalez and Rosso 2011).|$|E
40|$|Kappaiiota-hybrid carrageenans (Kl) are gelling natural polysaccharides {{extracted}} from seaweeds {{belonging to the}} Gigartinaceae family. The increasing demand for such natural gelling agents {{in a wide range}} of industrial applications calls for a sustainable production of Kl and a better understanding of the interplay between the chemical structure and the rheological <b>properties</b> of the <b>gels</b> obtained by cooling hot Kl solutions in the presence of salts [1]. Following preliminary studies on the <b>gel</b> <b>properties</b> of Kl {{extracted from}} wild seaweed [2 - 4], Masitocarpus stetiaius, Ahnfeitiopsils devoniensis and Chondrus crispus seaweeds were collected on the Portuguese coast and then used as water cleaning agents in a ﬁsh THITI 1, in order to produce an Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) system [5] allowing the sustainable production of carrageenophytes. Alter a month in IMTA, seaweeds were alkali treated with NaOH or KOH and Kl with different <b>gelling</b> <b>properties</b> in NaCI and KCI were extracted. Here we report on the <b>gel</b> <b>properties</b> measured with small amplitude oscillatory shear, on the gel fracture behaviour and on the shear and extensional visooelastic properties of solutions obtained for Kl concentrations below the gel formation. The rheological parameters are systematically compared with the chemistry of the Kl assessed with DRIFT and NMR. As a result, the general conclusions documented in previous studies [1 - 5] will be revisited.
