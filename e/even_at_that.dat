25|$|Prior to the eventful Boxing Day Test of 1995, Muralitharan had {{captured}} 80 wickets in 22 Tests at an unflattering average of 32.74. <b>Even</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> {{point in his}} career he was the leading wicket taker for Sri Lanka having gone past Rumesh Ratnayake's aggregate of 73 wickets.|$|E
25|$|<b>Even</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> young age, Hymes had a {{reputation}} as a strong linguist; his dissertation, completed in one year, was a grammar of the Kathlamet language spoken near the mouth of the Columbia and known primarily from Franz Boas’s work {{at the end of the}} 19th century.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s, {{collecting}} dime novels became popular, and prices soared. <b>Even</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time the cheap publications were crumbling into dust and becoming hard to find.

25|$|From a perusal of the {{aforesaid}} work, It {{is evident}} that Rudok {{was an integral part}} of Ladakh. Even after the family partition, Rudok continued to be part of Ladakh. Maryul meaning lowlands was a name given to a part of Ladakh. <b>Even</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time, i.e. in the 10th century, Rudok {{was an integral part of}} Ladakh and Lde-mchog-dkar-po, i.e., Demchok was an integral part of Ladakh.|$|E
25|$|Later {{investigations}} {{showed that}} the FBI misled Congress about investigating Casolaro's death. Members of an FBI task force looking Casolaro's death “questioned the conclusion of suicide” and recommended further investigation. This level of doubt “was especially significant, because <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time (December 1992), {{it was clear that}} to express those views risked one’s own judgment being called into question.” FBI documents show that some files on Casolaro are being withheld from public release, which is contradicted by the FBI saying the files are missing entirely.|$|E

25|$|The Air Corps needed engineering-trained pilots and, {{instead of}} being sent into an {{operational}} combat unit, Ridley was ordered to the Consolidated Vultee plant in Fort Worth, Texas, where his initial assignment was to conduct acceptance tests on four-engine B-24 Liberator bombers. Soon thereafter, he was named as engineering liaison officer on both the B-24 and B-32 programs. <b>Even</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> early date, the Air Corps was developing the mighty six-engine B-36 intercontinental bomber, later to become the mainstay of the postwar Strategic Air Command, and Ridley found himself assigned to that program as well.|$|E
25|$|Most of the Chitpavan Brahmins in Maharashtra {{have adopted}} Marathi as their language. A {{minority}} of Chitpavans spoke a dialect of Konkani called Chitpavani Konkani in their homes. <b>Even</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time, reports recorded Chitpavani as a fast disappearing language. But in Dakshina Kannada District and Udupi Districts of Karnataka, this language is being spoken {{in places like}} Durga and Maala of Karkala taluk and also in places like Shishila and Mundaje of Belthangady Taluk. There are no inherently nasalised vowels in standard Marathi whereas the Chitpavani dialect of Konkani does have nasalised vowels.|$|E
25|$|The metre {{gauge station}} at Visp was {{originally}} located, as at Brig, in the forecourt of the SBB station building. South {{of the two}} metre gauge platform tracks {{there used to be}} a connection to the extensive depot and workshop facilities of the BVZ. For passenger traffic, the VZ had already erected a wooden shelter by the start of operations in 1890, and, <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> point, all of the other necessary facilities, such as toilets or a waiting hall, were provided within the standard gauge station building of the Jura-Simplon (until 1889, the Suisse Occidentale-Simplon).|$|E

25|$|The {{son of an}} Australian {{engineer}} and his Indonesian wife, Ben Hollioake was born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1977. Hollioake got his cricketing start in Hong Kong, where the family lived for the two years until he was five, before they moved on to England. He played junior cricket in Sydney, especially in the Gladesville District Cricket Association, representing Gladesville District {{when he was just}} 9 years old, and was well renowned for his lightning fast bowling and talent with the bat – <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> young age. Hollioake moved to England in 1984, along with his older brother Adam. He was educated at Millfield Preparatory School and later at Millfield.|$|E
25|$|Around that time, one of Williams' acquaintances, a {{coloured}} lawyer named Edgar Maresse Smith, {{petitioned the}} Governor to declare 1 August a holiday for {{the celebration of}} Emancipation. Robinson did not support it but Gorrie did. <b>Even</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time, there was in Trinidad a highly educated, articulate and race-conscious group of black men, among them John Jacob Thomas, Maresse Smith, Mzumbo Lazare, C. E. Petioni, the Reverend Phillip Henry Douglin. Thomas particularly was famous for his book Froudacity (1889), in which he refuted and questioned the view espoused by Oxford historian James Anthony Froude that black people could not be entrusted with self-government. Thomas's ideas certainly inspired Williams.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, the {{unfinished}} site hosted {{a celebration of}} Queen Victoria's birthday, further cementing the area's position as the central place for national outpouring. The site was still incomplete when three of the British North American colonies (now the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick) entered Confederation in 1867, with Ottawa remaining {{the capital of the}} new country. Within four years Manitoba, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, and the North-West Territories (now Alberta, Saskatchewan, Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut) were added and, along with the associated bureaucracy, the first three required representation be added in parliament. Thus, the offices of parliament spread to buildings beyond Parliament Hill <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> early date.|$|E

25|$|On 1 October {{the force}} {{departed}} Rochefort, evacuating the Île d'Aix and arrived back in England on 6 October. Mordaunt justified his decision {{by saying that}} the navy was needed to cover an incoming French fleet from the West Indies rather than sitting indefinitely off Rochefort. Mordaunt's conduct was swiftly criticised by many officers who had taken part in the operation and had believed a landing had still been possible <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> late stage with the advantage of surprise lost. Wolfe and Howe were widely acclaimed for their efforts, but the disaster at Rochefort was compared to the failure of Admiral Byng to prevent the loss of Menorca the previous year, for which he had been shot.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 17th century, Pallaicatta's {{population}} has been estimated to have declined to just over 10,000. In 1746, the monsoon failed, resulting in a devastating famine. In the larger towns of Pulicat and Santhome alone the death toll was put at 15,000 and only {{one third of the}} textile weavers, painters and washers survived. Cloth prices increased 15% and little was available <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> price. An even more significant cause of the Dutch decline was conquest of the area by the Golconda forces commanded by Mir Jumla. Except for two short breaks, Dutch rule of Pulicat lasted for 214 years between 1606 and 1825 till the King of Arcot acceded Chingleput District (which included Pulicat village) to the British in 1825.|$|E
25|$|Pollen {{analyses}} {{show that}} the dry geest soils of North Germany have been cultivated since about 3000 BC. Clearance by fire and the cultivation of crops on the Pleistocene sandy soils quickly led however to soil degradation. So the land cleared by fire could only {{be used for a}} short time. The settlements moved frequently and woods elsewhere were cleared. <b>Even</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time the first Calluna (heather) heaths appeared (see above). Evidence of relatively dense settlement is found especially in Uelzen district. On Lüneburg Heath there are numerous Megalithic sites and tumuli from the Neolithic and the early Bronze Age. The most famous are the Oldendorfer Totenstatt (Oldendorf Gravesite) and the Sieben Steinhäuser (Seven Stone Houses). But even in the Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve {{there are more than a}} thousand tumuli, especially near Nieder- and Oberhaverbeck. The largest of these tumuli is the so-called Prince's Grave (Fürstengrab). Also near Wilsede there is the well-known stone and juniper group known as Hannibal's Grave (Hannibals Grab).|$|E

25|$|British rule {{had lost}} its {{legitimacy}} for most Hindus and conclusive proof of this {{came in the form}} of the 1946 elections with the Congress winning 91 percent of the vote among non-Muslim constituencies, thereby gaining a majority in the Central Legislature and forming governments in eight provinces, and becoming the legitimate successor to the British government for most Hindus. If the British intended to stay in India the acquiescence of politically active Indians to British rule would have been in doubt after these election results, although the views of many rural Indians were uncertain <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> point. The Muslim League won the majority of the Muslim vote as well as most reserved Muslim seats in the provincial assemblies and it also secured all the Muslim seats in the Central Assembly. Recovering from its performance in the 1937 elections, the Muslim League was finally able to make good on the claim that it and Jinnah alone represented India's Muslims and Jinnah quickly interpreted this vote as a popular demand for a separate homeland. However, tensions heightened while the Muslim League was unable to form ministries outside the two provinces of Sind and Bengal, with the Congress forming a ministry in the NFWP and the key Punjab province coming under a coalition ministry of the Congress, Sikhs and Unionists.|$|E
