40|$|Children's medical <b>expense</b> <b>subsidy</b> {{programs}} are programs run by local governments that use public monies {{to reduce or}} eliminate the copayments for children's medical treatment including pharmaceutical cost (typically 20 % for preschoolers and 30 % thereafter). Currently, all prefectures and municipalities in Japan provide subsidies for infants' and children's medical expenses, but scope on ages of eligibility, income limits, and copayment requirements vary. The fact that these {{programs are}} run by local governments {{has given rise to}} differences in the costs borne by households with children, depending on the jurisdiction in which they live. Therefore, although it would be desirable to gain society's understanding of such variation, the factors have not been fully studied. This analysis investigates what factors could impact such variation. In it, we looked at 219 municipalities in the prefectures in the Kanto region, focusing on the gap from the average age eligibility of municipalities, which reflects the scope of eligibility. Neither a regression analysis using the instrumental variable method to account for simultaneous decision bias nor an ordered logit analysis with rank of coverage as an order variable revealed that differences in copayments by locale had any impact on the scope of age eligibility. Residents' income and the number of children tended to narrow scope of eligibility for subsidies, but the strength of local government finances were not a significant factor of influence. In designing these programs, local government bodies take into account the local population's ability to pay and the number of eligible people, but their awareness of the local government's financial condition seems to be scant. Local governments are currently moving to expand their children's medical <b>expense</b> <b>subsidy</b> programs, but in the future they will need {{to pay more attention to}} balancing an expanded scope of eligibility by ages with the maintenance of local government fiscal discipline. In addition, copayments have not been adequately linked to the expansion of eligibility, so it would be advisable to clearly demonstrate the reason for this limit in order to eliminate perceptions of unfairness...|$|R

We will then explore a number of work incentives or special rules that seek to encourage work by either allowing benefits to continue for limited periods while working (trial work period (TWP), extended period of eligibility (EPE)), or allow individuals to quickly return to benefits status when a work effort stops or wage levels dip below the SGA level (expedited reinstatement).

This cross-sectional descriptive study surveyed 62 local government staff members who managed medical <b>expense</b> <b>subsidy</b> programs for infertility treatment in the Hokuriku region of Japan and 84 infertile women attending the clinics.

In the case of borrowing and as our workers are not forward looking, the wages of Greens are unchanged and welfare increases. If the government has to balance receipts and <b>expenses,</b> <b>subsidies</b> are borne by all workers, so this is equivalent to a tax on the hiring of Green workers and the total welfare remains constant.

Poverty and income inequality increase in both ‘countries’ when equivalent disposable income is corrected for housing expenses. Furthermore the relative position of outright owners and social tenants regarding poverty improves. Housing subsidies play a (partly) different role in Flanders and the Netherlands. The implicit social rent subsidy in Flanders and the explicit housing allowance in the Netherlands yet serve the same goal: they both redistribute income relatively strongly in favour of the low income tenants.

In order to help nomadic households from regions with severe grassland degradation and to let the grassland ecosystem restore itself, this program resettles households from affected regions into newly constructed settlements, which might be in the same county but are sometimes located even in a different province.

The objective of the EEAP is to reduce energy intensity by 25 % in 2030 compared to 2010. This is to be reached by reducing the projected energy consumption by 20 % or 38 Mtoe until 2030. We have specified an analytical framework, which allows for a calculation of the overall energy cost savings, energy import cost reductions and reduced CO 2 emissions. Moreover, we calculated the induced energy efficiency investments, employment effects and impacts on governmental budget. The evaluation shows that an effective implementation of the plan may lead to a reduction in energy expenditure of 37. 7 billion EUR by 2030. Moreover, the EEAP-induced energy savings will significantly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions as well as Thailand’s energy import costs and generate private investment in energy efficiency of about 5 billion EUR annually in 2030, which in turn may lead to about 300, 000 new jobs. The size of the net impact of the plan on Thailand’s governmental budget is uncertain due to positive and negative effects on corporate and income tax revenues, expenses for unemployment benefits, governmental energy consumption, <b>expenses</b> for energy <b>subsidies</b> and energy tax income...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: pages 134 - 147. Pollution control {{regulations}} {{directed at}} the land-based factories of the Southern African fish processing industry {{do not appear to}} promote the required level of investment in pollution control systems. Two self-administered mail-questionnaires comprising undisguised fixed-alternative and open-ended questions were constructed to survey the opinions and viewpoints of a census consisting of twenty-seven senior managers responsible for making pollution control investments in the demersal and pelagic sectors of the fish processing industry. The first questionnaire was directed at establishing the relative importance of factors that influence waste and pollution control investment decisions as well as the perceptions and preferences of managers with regard to various pollution control policy options. Descriptive statistics such as the modal class were used to summarize the distribution of opinions and viewpoints within the research population. Rank ordered preference data was analyzed using a multidimensional unfolding computer algorithm. This structural multivariate statistical method is a special case of non-metric multidimensional scaling that generates perceptual maps which can aid in the discovery of the hidden structure underlying multidimensional decisions. Investments in waste and pollution control do not appear to have a high priority when compared to other strategic investments that the fish processing industry managers may make. The relative importance of factors that could influence the managers of the industry to invest in waste control equipment appear to be determined by the perceived financial returns that can be expected from such investments. Findings suggest that pollution control legislation is rendered ineffective due to inadequate enforcement. However, it appears that existing legislation needs to be rationalized in order to facilitate compliance. The most favoured pollution control instruments were those that lowered the cost of legally mandated <b>expenses</b> such as <b>subsidies</b> and income tax allowances. These were followed by permit systems which specified the allowable characteristics of discharges while allowing individual companies freedom of choice as to the method of achieving compliance.

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to traditional subsidy schemes in utility sectors, direct subsidy programs have several advantages: they are transparent, they are explicit, and they minimize distortions {{of the behavior of}} both the utility, and the customers. At the same time, defining practical eligibility criteria for direct subsidy schemes is difficult, and identifying eligible households may entail substantial administrative costs. The authors, using a case study from Panama, discuss some of the issues associated with the design of direct subsidy systems for water services. The conclude that: 1) There is a need to assess - rather than assume - the need for a subsidy. A key test of affordability, and thus of the need for a subsidy, is to compare the cost of the service, with some measure of household willingness to pay. 2) The initial assessment must consider the affordability of connection costs as well as the affordability of the service itself. Connection costs may be prohibitive for poor households with no credit, suggesting a need to focus subsidies on providing access, rather than ongoing water consumption. 3) A key issue in designing a direct subsidy scheme is its targeting properties. Poverty is a complex phenomenon, and difficult to measure. Eligibility must therefore be based on easily measurable proxy variables, and good proxies are hard to find. In choosing eligibility criteria for a subsidy, it is essential to verify what proportion of the target group fails to meet the criteria (errors of exclusion) and what proportion of non-target groups is inadvertently eligible for the benefits (errors of inclusion). 4) administrative costs are roughly the same no matter what the level of individual subsidies, so a scheme that pays beneficiaries very little, will tend not to be cost-effective. It is important to determine what proportion of total program costs will be absorbed by administrative <b>expenses.</b> 5) <b>Subsidies</b> should not cover the full cost of the service, and should be contingent on beneficiaries paying their share of the bill. Subsidiesfor consumption above a minimum subsistence level, should be avoided. Subsidies should be provided long enough before eligibility is reassessed to avoid"poverty trap"problems. 6) The utility or concessionaire can be helpful in identifying eligible candidates, because of its superior information on the payment histories of customers. It will also have an incentive to do so, since it has an interest in improving poor payment records. Thought should therefore be given at the design stage {{to the role of the}} service provider in the implementation of the subsidy scheme. 7) The administrative agency's responsibilities, the sources of funding, and the general principles guiding the subsidy system should have a clear legal basis, backed by regulations governing administrative procedures. 8) To reduce administrative costs, and avoid duplication of effort, it would be desirable for a single set of institutional arrangements to be used to determine eligibility for all welfare, and subsidy programs in a given jurisdiction, whether sub-national, or national.

40|$|The central {{concept of}} the Russian agro-industrial {{production}} stabilization programme {{is a combination of}} market relations with government protectionist policy. The results achieved in the course of agrarian reforms in Russian regions indicate that there have been provided important legal and organizational conditions for successful functioning of multi-layer agriculture and formation of land market. However, as the paper shows, the agrarian reform still fails to bring about any growth in production. The present situation is such that if the current trends in AIC remain the downswing in production may make another 15 % in the nearest years. This requires immediate measures to be taken in order to increase food supply and protect the domestic commodity producers. For the purpose of planning a strategy of further reforms in AIC there have been identified the basic factors of stabilization of regional food markets. The paper contains the results of correlation-regression analysis and the typology of Russian regions based on the evaluation of the factors that govern the food demand and supply and the complex indicator of the level and structure of nourishment. It is shown that if the Russian food market is localized within the bounds of individual regions then the principal factors restraining food consumption are the low level of quality ecologically pure products. The paper also contains suggestions associated with improvement of the taxation system in part it is applied to agricultural commodity producers. principal factors restraining food consumption are the low level of development of the agrarian sector in the region and the insufficient provision of the local processing enterprises with raw agricultural produce. It is proven that the regional agrarian policy must pay due respect for the specific natural and climatic features {{as well as for the}} resource potential of the region. Along with this it is clear that food self-provision of regions must not in any way neutralize the production specialization and hamper the development of inter-regional ties. The research shows that the existing underdeveloped market environment is the cause for the low effectiveness of market means of regulation like interest rates and tax privileges. The application of direct economic instruments of regulation such as compensations for the agricultural producers' <b>expenses,</b> intervention purchases, <b>subsidies</b> and budget allocations for realization of investment programmes seems more reasonable in this situation. It is important that the agricultural commodity producers be supported selectively, the most effective ones having the priority. The authors outline some fundamental principles of a flexible price mechanism. The latter allows for the prices adjusted on federal and regional levels, pledge and target prices and price differentials for high quality ecologically pure products. The paper also contains suggestions associated with improvement of the taxation system in part it is applied to agricultural commodity producers. ...|$|R
