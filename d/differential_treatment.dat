25|$|It was remarked by the Court {{that not}} all {{differential}} treatments constitute discrimination. If the <b>differential</b> <b>treatment</b> pursues a legitimate aim, is rationally connected to the legitimate aim and {{is no more than}} necessary to accomplish the aim, the <b>differential</b> <b>treatment</b> is justified and does not constitute discrimination. Only when the <b>differential</b> <b>treatment</b> is unjustified will it be deemed as discrimination.|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies suggest}} that growth {{constraints}} in small states are not different from others and therefore they do not require special attention. In this article, we argue that {{this may not be}} so and therefore, the developed countries and donor agencies may have to reconsider special and <b>differential</b> <b>treatments</b> within the provisions of the WTO and establish a sustainable provision for small economies. Our analysis show that although trade liberalization provides positive stimulus for growth, small states endure high cost of doing business which have escalated following the withdrawal of <b>differential</b> <b>treatments</b> and this has had implications on small states performances. Further, these economies have been facing negative trade effects especially in the post– 1995 period. Therefore, we suggest that small states have a strong case to argue for continued support in the form of adjustment and adaptation funds in order to develop institutions, infrastructure, capacity and competitive domestic exports...|$|R

British African-West Indians have long asserted that they encounter discriminatory barriers to most middle- and higher-status occupations, as well as discrimination in hiring practices at all levels of employment. There is also considerable evidence that African-Caribbean people experience <b>differential</b> <b>treatment</b> at the hands of public officials, the British courts and penal system, and the police.

25|$|The Cancún ministerial {{collapsed}} {{for several}} reasons. First, differences over the Singapore issues seemed incapable of resolution. The EU had retreated on few of its demands, but several developing countries refused any consideration {{of these issues}} at all. Second, it was questioned whether some countries had come to Cancún with a serious intention to negotiate. In the view of some observers, a few countries showed no flexibility in their positions and only repeated their demands rather than talk about trade-offs. Third, the wide difference between developing and developed countries across virtually all topics was a major obstacle. The US–EU agricultural proposal {{and that of the}} G20 developing nations, for example, show strikingly different approaches to special and <b>differential</b> <b>treatment.</b> Fourth, there was some criticism of procedure. Some claimed the agenda was too complicated. Also, Cancún ministerial chairman, Mexico’s Foreign Minister Luis Ernesto Derbez, was faulted for ending the meeting when he did, instead of trying to move the talks into areas where some progress could have been made.|$|E
500|$|This {{concept was}} more fully expounded in Public Prosecutor v.
