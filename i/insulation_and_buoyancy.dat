40|$|This Digest {{discusses}} {{the nature and}} general properties of plastic foams (or cellular plastics). Plastic foams may be either open-cell or closed-cell; they may be flexible, semi- flexible (or semi-rigid) and rigid, depending {{on the degree of}} rigidity of the plastic matrix. Rigid closed-cell foams can have good thermal <b>insulation</b> properties <b>and</b> <b>buoyancy</b> characteristics. Open-cell foams can have good cushioning properties (e. g. flexible) and sound absorbing characteristics. Since plastic foams have a relatively large surface area, the problem of flammability is more acute than with bulk plastics.

30|$|Blubber {{performs}} {{a variety of}} functions in aquatic mammals, such as acting as an energy reserve, for thermal <b>insulation,</b> providing <b>buoyancy,</b> <b>and</b> streamlining the body (Ryg et al. 1988). Lipids are almost entirely accumulated within this tissue, which can constitute {{a large proportion of}} an animalâ€™s gross mass (Read 1990). It has become common to assess the condition of marine mammals on the basis of blubber measurements, sometimes in conjunction with other morphological parameters (Gomez-Campos et al. 2011; Miller et al. 2011).|$|R
25|$|Damage to {{the upper}} part of the suit can cause a sudden venting of the air, {{resulting}} in a loss of <b>buoyancy</b> <b>and</b> possible uncontrolled descent, followed by flooding with water and loss of thermal <b>insulation,</b> <b>and</b> possible exposure to hazardous materials if the water is contaminated.|$|R
25|$|Reasonable {{care must}} be taken not to {{puncture}} or tear membrane dry suits, because <b>buoyancy</b> <b>and</b> <b>insulation</b> depend entirely on the air space in the undersuit, (whereas a wetsuit normally allows water to enter, <b>and</b> retains its <b>insulation</b> despite it). The dry suit material offers essentially no buoyancy or insulation itself, so if the dry suit leaks or is torn, water can soak the undersuit, with a corresponding loss of <b>buoyancy</b> <b>and</b> <b>insulation.</b>|$|R
25|$|Wetsuits {{provide both}} thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>and</b> flotation. Many {{swimmers}} lack buoyancy in the leg. The wetsuit reduces density, <b>and</b> therefore improves <b>buoyancy</b> while swimming. It provides insulation by absorbing {{some of the}} surrounding water, which then heats up when {{in direct contact with}} skin. The wetsuit is the usual choice for those who swim in cold water for long periods of time, as it reduces susceptibility to hypothermia.|$|R
