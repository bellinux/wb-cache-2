Zenker's turaco is found in forests of Central Africa in the Congo Basin in Gabon, DR Congo and Congo Brazaville and south to northern Angola. It forms part of a superspecies complex that extends from West Africa to East Africa and {{as far south as}} the Cape in Southern Africa and include the black-billed turaco, Emin's, Schalow's turaco, Livingstone's turaco, the Transvaal turaco and the Knysna turaco, as subspecies within the group.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Guinea</b> <b>turaco,</b> often {{inconspicuous}} in the treetops, {{is approximately}} 43 cm long, including a long tail. The plumage is largely green and the tail and wings are dark purplish, {{except for the}} crimson primary feathers that are very distinct in flight. In the westernmost subspecies buffoni, which sometimes {{is known as the}} Buffon's turaco, there is a white line above and in front of the eye and a black line below the eye. In the nominate subspecies (T. persa persa) of the central part of its range and zenkeri of the southeastern part there also is a second white line below the black line. Unlike similar turacos with red bills, even adult Guinea turacos lack a white rear edge to the crest.|$|E
