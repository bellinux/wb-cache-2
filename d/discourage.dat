5|$|Houses at Noel Park were {{deliberately}} {{designed to}} be relatively small, both for cheapness and to <b>discourage</b> tenants from taking on lodgers. Many of the larger houses at Shaftesbury Park had been sublet and split, and the practice went against {{the principles of the}} Artizans Company's founders. To <b>discourage</b> the practice at Queen's Park and Noel Park, cottage flats were built; these maintained the terraced façade, but split the house into upper and lower flats, each flat having a separate front door onto the street. Many properties, particularly on the central Gladstone Avenue, were built in this style; this maintained the unbroken façade of the first-class houses, but allowed large numbers of smaller and low-income families to be housed.|$|E

30|$|By {{looking at}} labour force participation, {{we wanted to}} {{identify}} factors that affected workers’ withdrawal from the labour market. We broadened the standard definition of the <b>discouraged</b> worker effect. We wanted to determine to what extent old-age benefits <b>discouraged</b> workers from active job search. We treated these benefits as an alternative source of income. They could be already paid out or shortly available to eligible workers. We focused on the outflow from unemployment to inactivity and approximated the <b>discouraged</b> worker effect by this outflow. Thus, we did not analyse pure <b>discouraged</b> worker effect. By <b>discouraged</b> workers, in turn, we meant those who had stopped seeking a job during the 1 -year interval.|$|R

Today, In the United States, {{according to the}} U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as of April 2009, there are 740,000 <b>discouraged</b> workers. There is an ongoing debate as to whether <b>discouraged</b> workers {{should be included in}} the official unemployment rate. Over time, it has been shown that a disproportionate number of young people, blacks, Hispanics, and men make up <b>discouraged</b> workers. Nonetheless, it is generally believed that the <b>discouraged</b> worker is underestimated because it does not include homeless people or those who have not looked for or held a job during the past twelve months and is often poorly tracked.|$|R

5|$|Birth control, {{also known}} as {{contraception}} and fertility control, is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy. Birth control has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century. Planning, making available, and using birth control is called family planning. Some cultures limit or <b>discourage</b> access to birth control because they consider it to be morally, religiously, or politically undesirable.|$|E
40|$|The Discouragement Scale for Adults (DSA) was {{developed}} to assess for the Adlerian construct of discouragement in adults age 18 years and over. Data were collected from three samples: norm (n= 586), presumed <b>discouraged</b> (n= 47), and {{parents of children with}} craniofacial anomaly (n= 105). Five subscales corresponding to life tasks identified in Adlerian literature as work, love, society, self-significance, and spirituality underlie the 60 item DSA. Item selection was based on ratings by five notable Adlerians and item correlations with scale scores. Gender, age, and ethnicity norms were established for the norm, presumed <b>discouraged,</b> and craniofacial samples. Across three samples, no significant ethnic differences were found. Normative findings indicated females are less <b>discouraged</b> than males on the Total DSA, the society and spirituality subscales. Age findings indicated the 18 - 34 year old sample is more <b>discouraged</b> than other ages on the Total DSA, the work, society, and spirituality subscales. Presumed <b>discouraged</b> findings indicated females are less <b>discouraged</b> than males on the society subscale. Craniofacial findings indicated females are less <b>discouraged</b> on the society subscale, but more <b>discouraged</b> on the self-significance subscale than males. Age findings indicated the 18 - 34 year old sample is more <b>discouraged</b> than other ages on the self subscale. Research on CPA parents' relationship status, CPA child's birth order, parental role of adult to CFA child, length of time the parent has cared for CFA child, the CFA child's age, CFA parent's education level, and CFA child's craniofacial anomaly diagnosis was conducted. Findings indicated birthmothers are less <b>discouraged</b> than birthfathers on the society subscale, but more <b>discouraged</b> on the self-significance subscale. Internal consistency ratings of the DSA were. 9392,. 9496, and. 9365 for three samples. Correlations to measures of social interest were negative and significant, reflecting an inverse relationship between discouragement and social interest. Factor analysis and interscale correlations are presented. Future research could include continued instrument validation and establishment of score ranges to indicate adult discouragement...|$|R

In a microeconomic perspective (Section 3), we approximate the <b>discouraged</b> worker effect by the outflow from unemployment to inactivity and identify factors that entice older workers to withdraw from the job search. We focus on the roles of old-age benefits and the business cycle. In Section 4, we discuss the results, and in Section 5, we present our conclusions.|$|R
