5|$|Claudius was a heretic <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> of Dungal and Jonas of Orléans, {{who later}} wrote to refute {{some of his}} teachings {{at the request of}} the emperor. The last {{recorded}} act of Claudius is in a charter of the monastery of St Peter at Novalesa in May 827. He was dead by the time Dungal finished his Responsa contra peruersas Claudii Taurinensis episcopi sententias late in 827, so it can be presumed that he died that year.|$|E
5|$|His {{antiquarian}} studies led Planché to take {{an interest}} in heraldry. He had published several papers on heraldic topics in the Journal of the British Archaeological Association before publishing in 1852 The Pursuivant of Arms, or, Heraldry founded upon facts. As indicated by the subtitle, Planché was concerned with verifiable facts, as opposed to the unfounded theories perpetuated by many earlier heraldic writers. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> of eminent herald Sir Anthony Wagner, Planché rewrote the early history of heraldry.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> of Pierre Riché, the {{disappearance}} of 220 bishops' seats indicates that the Lombard migration was a crippling catastrophe for the Church. Yet according to Walter Pohl the regions directly occupied by Alboin suffered less devastation and had a relatively robust survival rate for towns, whereas the occupation of territory by autonomous military bands interested mainly in raiding and looting had a more severe impact, with the bishoprics in such places rarely surviving.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> of his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet's main {{influences}} were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz {{also important}} to his style. From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but he took from the earlier composer a richness of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> of the {{production}} team, Peggy's breast cancer was a catalyst, creating new dynamics and tensions amongst existing characters. Realism was also an issue.

5|$|Metal {{artefacts}} {{share the}} same geometric designs {{that are used in}} other forms of Islamic art. However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> of Hamilton Gibb, the emphasis differs: geometric patterns tend to be used for borders, and if they are in the main decorative area they are most often used in combination with other motifs such as floral designs, arabesques, animal motifs, or calligraphic script. Geometric designs in Islamic metalwork can form a grid decorated with these other motifs, or they can form the background pattern.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} {{king of the}} third kingdom is Ibbit-Lim, who {{described}} himself as the Mekim of Ebla.

5|$|Æthelnoth was {{a son of}} the Æthelmær the Stout and a {{grandson}} of Æthelweard the Historian, who was a great-great-grandson of Æthelred I. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> of the historian Frank Barlow, Æthelnoth was probably the uncle of Godwin of Wessex. He was baptised by Dunstan, and a story was told at Glastonbury Abbey that as the infant was baptised, his hand made a motion much like that an archbishop makes when blessing. From this motion, Dunstan {{is said to have}} prophesied that Æthelnoth would become an archbishop.|$|E
5|$|Alfred also {{assisted}} {{his own son}} {{by promoting}} men who could be relied on to support him, and by giving him opportunities for command in battle once he was old enough. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> of Barbara Yorke, the compilation of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which magnified Alfred's achievements, may have been partly intended to strengthen {{the case for the}} succession of his own descendants. However, Yorke also argues that Æthelwold's position was not fatally undermined by Alfred's will. His mother had witnessed a charter as regina, whereas Alfred followed West Saxon tradition in refusing to have his wife consecrated as queen, and Æthelwold's status as the son of a queen may have given him an advantage over Edward. Æthelwold was still the senior ætheling, and the only surviving charter he witnessed shows both him and Edward as filius regis (son of a king), but lists Æthelwold above Edward, implying that he ranked above him.|$|E

50|$|Many {{countries}} and national censuses currently enumerate or have previously enumerated their populations by race, ethnicity, nationality, {{or a combination}} of these characteristics. Different countries have different classifications and census options for race and ethnicity/nationality which are not comparable with data from other countries. In addition, many of the race and ethnicity concepts that appear on national censuses worldwide have their origins in Europe or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>views</b> of Europeans, rather than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>views</b> of <b>the</b> locals of these countries.|$|R
40|$|Binocular eye {{position}} was {{monitored by the}} photoelectric technique during accommodative vergence. Contrary to previous reports indicating that accommodative vergence was a uniocular phenomenon, without exception, binocular accommodative vergence movements were recorded. The total vergence amplitude <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewing</b> eye was reduced, on the average. by approximately SSP, {{with respect to the}} vergence movement measured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> covered eye. Some saccadic eye movements that occurred during vergence movements were likewise reduced <b>in</b> amplitude <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewing</b> eye by up to 20 %. Smooth eye movements were utilized to counteract <b>the</b> vergence movement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewing</b> eye. This smooth movement alone, or in conjunction with a late saccade, returned the eye to the target and helped to maintain the retinal image of the target coincident with the fovea 1 center {{for the duration of the}} accommodative vergence movement. Thus, there appears to be a fixation-holding mechanism which produced a general attenuation of both vergence and some saccadic movements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewing</b> eye. Although this control strategy produced violations of Hering’s law with respect to the magnitude of <b>the</b> movements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eyes but not with respect to the direction of the movement. it was implemented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interest of retaining the target within the sensitive fovea 1 region...|$|R
5|$|Between 1928 {{until his}} death, al-Qassam {{served as the}} {{president}} of the Young Men's Muslim Association (YMMA) in Haifa. While he focused his activism with the lower classes, his position in the YMMA afforded him access with the middle and educated classes of the city who were attracted to Hizb al-Istiqlal (Independence Party), an Arab nationalist political party. In particular, he developed a strong relationship with leading local party member Rashid al-Hajj Ibrahim, the previous president of the Haifa YMMA. A wide ideological gap between the secularist al-Istiqlal and al-Qassam was bridged by a convergence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> that the struggle against Zionist expansion in Palestine was inseparable from active opposition to British rule. This view separated al-Qassam and al-Istiqlal from the mainstream political forces in Palestine at the time. While men from al-Istiqlal and the YMMA generally refrained from joining al-Qassam's cause, his association with them helped protect him from political figures who opposed his activism. His activities were also financed by several well-off businessmen associated with al-Istiqlal due to his spreading reputation.|$|E

5|$|Hagiographic {{accounts}} of Harding's life quickly followed his death, such as Joe Mitchell Chapple's Life and Times of Warren G. Harding, Our After-War President (1924). By then, the scandals were breaking, and the Harding administration {{soon became a}} byword for corruption <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> of the public. Works written in the late 1920s helped shape Harding's historical reputation: Masks in a Pageant by William Allen White mocked and dismissed Harding, as did Samuel Hopkins Adams' fictionalized account of the Harding administration, Revelry. These books depicted Harding's time in office as one of great presidential weakness. The publication of Nan Britton's bestselling book disclosing they had had an affair also lowered the late president in public esteem. President Coolidge, not wishing to be further associated with his predecessor, refused to dedicate the Harding Tomb. Hoover, Coolidge's successor, was similarly reluctant, but with Coolidge in attendance presided over the dedication in 1931. By that time, with the Great Depression in full swing, Hoover was nearly as discredited as Harding.|$|E
