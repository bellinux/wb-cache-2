25|$|Before we put real {{effort into}} the Severn Beach line <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> {{sacrificial}} lamb for other services. So if {{we needed a}} spare train, we would pull one off the line and cancel it, which was why punctuality and reliability was so poor. After the public campaign in 2006 {{we decided that we}} didn't want to take that to carry on any more.|$|E
25|$|The North of England and South of England cricket teams {{appeared}} in first-class cricket between the 1836 and 1961 seasons, {{most often in}} matches against each other but also individually in games against touring teams, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and others. Until international cricket became firmly established {{towards the end of}} the 19th century, the North v South match was one of the major fixtures in the cricketing calendar along with Gentlemen v Players. Indeed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> major fixture because whereas the Gentlemen teams were often very weak, North v South could potentially showcase the best 22 players in the country. In all, the North played against the South 155 times in first-class matches.|$|E
2500|$|King Arthur comes {{inside the}} Underbrooke diner, {{confused}} {{and not knowing}} that he is dead, until he is reunited with Hook who after a denial and angry conversation tells him he's in the Underworld now, he asks for Arthur's help in stopping Hades. King Arthur agrees to help him after being told he can either be sent to a better place or worse place or be trapped here forever. Later, Hook and King Arthur searched Hades' lair where they look for Hades' story, when Arthur realizes {{that the only way}} that Hades keeps his secrets would be inside his throne just like Arthur would do and find the missing pages. Shortly after that, Hook and King Arthur learn from Cruella that the [...] "Once Upon a Time" [...] book is near the River of Lost Souls, and when Hook and King Arthur find it there the lost Souls attempt to take it and Arthur but thanks to Hook he saves both Arthur and the book, where they discover the only way to destroy Hades is by using the Olympian Crystal, and Hook uses the book to magically reach the living successfully (after Emma sees it). Later, King Arthur decides to stay in the Underworld to repair it, telling Hook that he was prophesized to repair a broken kingdom, thinking it was Camelot when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> Underworld. Hook steps into the light of Mount Olympus and he meets Zeus, who then shows Hook {{the way back to the}} land of the living.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{are keeping}} this young lady," [...] he remarked, [...] "from {{what seems to}} be her daily pilgrimage. I wonder whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> pictures, or Mrs. Tresfarwin's cakes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} could say whither instead of when," [...] Lady Caroom answered. [...] "How bored you would <b>be</b> at Redcliffe. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> most outlandish place we go to." ...|$|R
60|$|Hearing this, Bilbil cast a surly {{glance at}} his master but said nothing, since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> goat's {{business}} to carry King Rinkitink wherever he desired to go.|$|E
60|$|He moved, and glancing {{from her}} to the place she had lately occupied, as if to assure himself that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> child so near him, looked inquiringly into her face.|$|E
6000|$|... “Oh, Matilda got fed, after a fashion, but it {{was judged}} to be best for her to cut her visit short. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> only thing to be done,” said Clovis with some emphasis.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{respect the}} orders of the Junta," [...] Herrara replied, [...] "and are ready {{to open the door}} as you demand; but I must first <b>be</b> assured that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> {{committee}} appointed by the Junta that demand it." ...|$|R
50|$|The first Cape Liptrap {{lighthouse}} {{was established}} in 1913. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> a 2.1 metre steel tower with an acetylene light. As a lighthouse keeper was never stationed at Cape Liptrap, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> first automatic Commonwealth funded light {{to be put into}} service.|$|R
50|$|Her tomb {{is located}} on the hill in Gyeongju city. Although some historians have doubt that if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> tomb of Queen Jindeok. According to the Samguk Sagi she was buried at Saryangbu, which is located in the {{opposite}} direction from the tomb.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am already bold {{enough in}} so good a cause," [...] {{returned}} the veteran, rejecting her bounty. [...] "Betty, {{do you think}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> peddler spy that I placed in this room the last night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Boat ahoy!" [...] shouted Dave, and then, as {{they drew}} closer, {{he saw that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> Kingsley craft. He was chagrined to see that only a man was on board, a fellow who was running the boat very slowly.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> princess {{who saved}} aunt Dorcas's home from destruction. Had she not seen Dan Fernald, {{as he made}} his way through the orchard, the barn would most likely have been in a blaze before Joe or Plums were aware of the fact.|$|E
5000|$|Electra. As {{mentioned}} previously, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> central character.

60|$|Dear Ruth! Dearest Ruth, {{for saying}} such dear words! She had {{done more than}} Rebecca by the {{sweetness}} of <b>the</b> suggestion.

6000|$|... "'I am {{delighted to}} hear it, for your advice at present would be {{exceedingly}} valuable to me.

60|$|Nor, indeed, could less be expected, {{for here}} {{were so many}} prisons in the town as there were houses shut up; and as the people shut up or imprisoned so were guilty of no crime, only shut up because miserable, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> more {{intolerable}} to them.|$|E
60|$|This made me very cautious, and I {{had good}} reason for it too; and yet the {{sickness}} and danger of my men pressed me very hard to have {{the advice of a}} good physician, if it was possible, and especially to be satisfied whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> plague or no, for I was very uneasy about that.|$|E
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> idea of her correspondent, but Sophia Antonovna {{had adopted}} it fully. She stated {{it in one}} word--"Remorse." [...] Razumov opened his eyes very wide at that. Sophia Antonovna's informant, by {{listening}} to {{the talk of the}} house, by putting this and that together, had managed to come very near to the truth of Haldin's relation to Ziemianitch.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{all this}} time the prince was on the balcony, telling Lady Rosalind all about how he got the Firedrake done for, in the most modest way; for, as he said: [...] "I didn't kill him: and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> Remora, poor fellow, who should marry Molly; but he's dead." ...|$|R

2500|$|... (The text is {{presented}} {{as that of the}} 1962 edition, but the spelling of the Latin, e.g. [...] "coelum", [...] "quotidianum", use of the letter J, shows that, apart from the insertion of [...] "sed et beati Ioseph eiusdem Virginis Sponsi" [...] in the Canon of <b>the</b> Mass, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> 1920 text, identical with the 1962 text except for spelling and this insertion) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Still I {{shall make}} him ask me yet,' Lady Hilda thought to herself, as she parted {{from him to}} go up and dress for dinner. 'I shall manage to marry him, somehow; or if I don't marry him, at any rate I'll marry {{somebody}} like him.' For <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> principle, not the person, that Lady Hilda specially insisted upon.|$|E
60|$|We {{were terrified}} into this by being {{suddenly}} {{confronted with a}} vast body which showed itself vaguely for an instant {{and in the next}} instant was smothered in the fog again. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> hotel we were after, monstrously magnified by the fog, but we took it for the face of a precipice, and decided not to try to claw up it.|$|E
60|$|Lawford {{took out}} his pocket-book and a card. 'Mine,' he said, handing it gravely to his companion. 'is Lawford--at least...' <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> first time that either had seen the other's face at close {{quarters}} and clear-lit; and on Lawford's a moon almost at the full shone dazzlingly. He saw an expression--dismay, incredulity, overwhelming astonishment--start suddenly into the dark, rather indifferent eyes.|$|E

50|$|Joe {{tells the}} police but nobody listens so he visits {{the offices of}} the Trump.

At the store, Joe’s gang think they have overpowered <b>the</b> thieves but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> police, who have been tipped off anonymously.

60|$|But as {{we dropped}} into our places the Story Girl shot a {{significant}} glance at me which intimated {{that this was}} the psychological moment for introducing the scheme she and I had been secretly developing for some days. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> Story Girl's idea and none of mine.

6000|$|And well he might. Five {{minutes before}} that time he had thrown open a gulf of treachery {{between himself and the}} {{architect}} which nothing in life could ever close.

6000|$|... 'I forget {{sometimes}} that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> Bishop of Autun to whom I am speaking,' said he.
