5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) is {{a gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the lowest price per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of <b>fuel</b> <b>content</b> before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|E

Results showed that the weather data from in–situ measurement within the forest and the CWS (Chuncheon Weather Station) had different patterns in that average temperature and max temperature tended to be higher in the forest, while min temperature had lower in the forest.

We propose a method to assimilate dead <b>fuel</b> moisture <b>content</b> observations from remote automated weather stations (RAWS) into a time-lag fuel moisture model. RAWS are spatially sparse and a mechanism is needed to estimate <b>fuel</b> moisture <b>content</b> at locations potentially distant from observational stations.

40|$|Since 1 st of January 2015 ships {{operating}} in sulphur emission control areas (SECAs) {{have to use}} marine fuels with a <b>fuel</b> sulphur <b>content</b> less than 0. 1 %m/m. This regulation forces the ship owners to make a fuel shift and use low-sulphur marine fuel oils, use alternative fuels or use scrubbers on-board their ships. One {{driving force behind the}} regulation of the <b>fuel</b> sulphur <b>content</b> was to reduce the emissions to air of harmful particles. This thesis focuses on the two first strategies and evaluate how <b>fuel</b> sulphur <b>content</b> and other <b>fuel</b> characteristics affect the particle emissions. This thesis presents results from particle measurements done in test-bed engine labs and on-board operating ships, with focus on number, mass and sizes of the emitted particles. The on-board measurements considered how a fuel shift from a heavy fuel oil to a low-sulphur residual marine fuel oil and how use of an alternative fuel, in this case liquefied natural gas (LNG) affect the particle emissions. In the test-bed engine measurements the particle emissions from different types of fuels and the effects of <b>fuel</b> sulphur <b>content</b> and other <b>fuel</b> characteristics, primarily the content of aromatics, were investigated. The results highlight that reduced <b>fuel</b> sulphur <b>contents</b> will not be the only solution for reducing particle emissions, and other fuel characteristics need to be considered. The <b>fuel</b> sulphur <b>content</b> influences the emissions of particles with a diameter of 50 nm or less, whereas other fuel characteristics affect particles in all sizes. An increased content of aromatics did not result in increasing particle emissions, which indicate that the content of aromatics may not play a crucial role with respect to particle emissions from ships. Furthermore, the fuel shift strategy and changing from heavy fuel oil to a low-sulphur residual marine fuel oil, did not affect the number of particles emitted significantly: similar amounts of number of particles were emitted and there was an increase in the emissions of smaller particles. In contrast, the strategy of using an alternative fuel, here LNG, resulted in significant reductions of the particle emissions. Furthermore, the results also highlight the importance of conducting measurements of number of particles emitted when studying particle emissions from ships and in any future regulation of these emissions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Grass senescence, or {{grassland}} curing, is {{a dynamic}} process in which grass fuels transition from a live to dead state and, in turn, influence fire dynamics. In the present study we examined the process of curing with specific consideration of changes in fuel structure that will affect potential fire behaviour. Our sampling protocol expanded the fuel component groups from two (live and dead) to four (green, senescing, new dead and old dead fuel). We found that all these components had significant <b>fuel</b> moisture <b>content</b> differences, thereby justifying our sampling protocol. Visual curing assessment predominantly resulted in an over-prediction bias of curing level and failed to capture {{the effect of the}} senescing process on fuel availability to combust due to misclassification of fuel components (e. g. senescing fuels with high <b>fuel</b> moisture <b>content</b> were classified as dead fuels because of their colouration).

Our analysis identified {{no significant difference between}} emission factors for auxiliary and main engines and between emission factors and load factor, installed power, or model year. We found PM emission factors for vessels operating on heavy fuel oil at 2. 5 % sulfur content were statistically significantly higher (1. 5 g/KW-hr) than vessels operating on distillate fuel (0. 3 g/KW-hr). While we expected to identify a clear relationship between <b>fuel</b> sulfur <b>content</b> and PM emission factors, our analysis identified only a weak relationship. A future sulfur emission control area may be defined across North America with a 1. 5 % <b>fuel</b> oil sulfur <b>content</b> limit.

Scenario 1 had a slightly stronger aerosol-induced radiative flux perturbation (RFP) from shipping than the present-day scenario (− 0. 43 W m − 2 vs. − 0. 39 W m − 2) while reducing premature mortality from shipping by 69 % (globally 34 900 deaths avoided per year). Scenario 2 decreased the RFP to − 0. 06 W m − 2 and annual deaths by 96 % (globally 48 200 deaths avoided per year) compared to present-day. A small difference in radiative effect (global mean of 0. 04 W m − 2) in the coastal regions between Scenario 1 and the present-day scenario imply that shipping emission regulation in the existing emission control areas should not be removed in hope of climate cooling.
