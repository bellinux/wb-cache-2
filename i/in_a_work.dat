5|$|After the Norman Conquest, in 1066, Æthelwig {{was one of}} the few Englishmen trusted by the new King William the Conqueror, and {{was given}} {{authority}} over parts of western England. As part of his duties, he was a royal judge and held important prisoners. During the Harrying of the North in 1069–1070, Æthelwig gave aid to refugees from the north of England. He also helped the king in the rebellion of 1075, preventing one of the rebels from joining the others. Æthelwig died on 16 February in either 1077 or 1078, and was memorialised <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> on his life that was later incorporated in the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, a 13th-century history of the abbey and its abbots.|$|E
5|$|Art Farmer {{was born}} {{an hour before}} his twin brother, on August 21, 1928, in Council Bluffs, Iowa, {{reportedly}} at 2201 Fourth Avenue. Their parents, James Arthur Farmer and Hazel Stewart Farmer, divorced when the boys were four, and their steelworker father was killed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> accident not long after this. Art moved with his grandfather, grandmother, mother, brother and sister to Phoenix, Arizona {{when he was still}} four. He started to play the piano while in elementary school, then moved on to bass tuba and violin before settling on cornet and then trumpet at the age of thirteen. His family was musical: most of them played as a hobby, and one was a professional trombonist. Art's grandfather was a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. This influenced Farmer's first choice of instrument, as his mother played piano for the church choir. The bass tuba was for use in a marching band and was Farmer's instrument for a year, until a cornet became available. Phoenix schools were segregated, and no one at Farmer's school could provide useful music lessons. He taught himself to read music and practiced his new main instrument, the trumpet.|$|E

5|$|At Christmas 1085, William {{ordered the}} {{compilation}} {{of a survey}} of the landholdings held by himself and by his vassals throughout the kingdom, organised by counties. It resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> now known as the Domesday Book. The listing for each county gives the holdings of each landholder, grouped by owners. The listings describe the holding, who owned the land before the Conquest, its value, what the tax assessment was, and usually the number of peasants, ploughs, and any other resources the holding had. Towns were listed separately. All the English counties south of the River Tees and River Ribble are included, and the whole work seems to have been mostly completed by 1 August 1086, when the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that William received the results and that all the chief magnates swore the Salisbury Oath, a renewal of their oaths of allegiance. William's exact motivation in ordering the survey is unclear, but it probably had several purposes, such as making a record of feudal obligations and justifying increased taxation.|$|E

Padmananka (1385) wrote a biography of his ancestor Kereya Padmarasa, a Hoysala minister and poet, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> titled Padmaraja Purana. The writing provides details about the Hoysala Empire and notable personalities such as the poets Harihara and Raghavanka. Chandrashekara (or Chrakavi), a court poet of Deva RayaII, wrote an account on the Virupaksha temple, its precincts and settlements at Pampapura (modern Hampi) in the Pampasthana Varnanam in 1430. MangarajaII authored a lexicon called Mangaraja Nighantu in 1398, while Abhinava Chandra gave an account on veterinary science in his book called Asva Vaidya in the 14th century. Kavi Malla wrote on erotics in the Manmathavijaya in the 14th century. In the 15th century, Madhava translated an earlier Sanskrit poem by Dandi and called it Madhavalankara, and Isvara Kavi (also called Bana Kavi) wrote a prosody called Kavijihva Bandhana.|$|E

5|$|In {{later life}} she {{converted}} to Buddhism and remained single thereafter, largely {{retiring from the}} world.

With her Buddhist friend Yang Jiangzi (the sister of Xue's fellow courtesan Liu Yin), she made pilgrimages to sacred sites such as Mount Lu and Mount Emei. The date of her death is uncertain; some sources suggest that she may have lived into the 1650s whilst others put her death in the late 1630s or early 1640s. Qian Qianyi mentions her death <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> published in 1652, so it is evident that she must have died before this date.|$|E
