As ambient light levels, such as sunlight, exceed the backlight, a grayscale display is seen; {{this can be}} useful when reading e-books for an extended time in bright light such as sunlight. The backlight brightness can also be adjusted to vary the level of color seen in the display and to conserve battery power.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} use of film-based periapical radiographs and digital {{panoramic}} <b>images</b> <b>displayed</b> on monitor and glossy paper {{in the assessment of}} the periapical status of the teeth. Methodology: A total of 86 subjects were examined. All participants underwent a full-mouth radiographic survey (14 periapical radiographs) and a digital panoramic radiography. The periapical status of all appraised teeth was assessed. Results: Periapical radiographs allowed the assessment of the periapical status of a significantly higher percentage of teeth (87. 4 %) Digital radiography had a significantly reduced potential to allow assessment of the periapical status (p< 0. 01). Only 58. 0 % and 34. 3 % of teeth could be appraised using digital panoramic <b>images</b> <b>displayed</b> on monitor and glossy paper respectively (p< 0. 01). The total percentage of teeth with periapical pathosis was four-fold higher when assessed with digital panoramic <b>images</b> <b>displayed</b> on glossy paper compared with periapical radiographs (p< 0. 01). Conclusions: Periapical radiographs allowed the assessment of a significantly higher percentage of teeth when comparing to digital radiography, which had a significantly lower potency in the assessment of periapical status of the teeth. Digital panoramic <b>images</b> <b>displayed</b> on a monitor resulted in a significantly higher percentage of appraised teeth compared to digital <b>images</b> <b>displayed</b> on glossy paper. Apical periodontitis was scored more often on paper than on screen, and more often on screen than in periapical radiographs...|$|R
