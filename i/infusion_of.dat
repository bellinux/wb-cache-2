40|$|Intra-septal <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist {{muscimol}} impair {{learning and}} memory {{in a variety}} of tasks. This experiment determined whether hippocampal or entorhinal <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine would reverse such impairing effects on spontaneous alternation performance, a measure of spatial working memory. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given intra-septal <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> vehicle or muscimol (1 nmole/ 0. 5 μL) combined with unilateral intra-hippocampal or intra-entorhinal <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> vehicle or physostigmine (10 μg/μL for the hippocampus; 7. 5 μg/μL or 1. 875 μg/ 0. 25 μL for the entorhinal cortex). Fifteen minutes later, spontaneous alternation performance was assessed. The results indicated that intra-septal <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> muscimol significantly decreased percentage-of-alternation scores, whereas intra-hippocampal or intra-entorhinal <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> physostigmine had no effect. More importantly, intra-hippocampal or intra-entorhinal <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> physostigmine, at doses that did not influence performance when administered alone, completely reversed the impairing effects <b>of</b> the muscimol <b>infusions.</b> These findings indicate that increasing cholinergic levels in the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex is sufficient to reverse the impairing effects of septal GABA receptor activation and support the hypothesis that the impairing effects of septal GABAergic activity involve cholinergic processes in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{findings}} indicate that the noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and cholinergic innervations of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) modulate memory consolidation. The current study investigated whether memory enhancement induced by post-training intra-BLA <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> a β-adrenergic or muscarinic cholinergic agonist requires concurrent activation of dopamine (DA) receptors in the BLA. Rats with implanted BLA cannulae were trained on an inhibitory avoidance (IA) task and, 48 h later, tested for retention. <b>Infusions</b> <b>of</b> the β-adrenergic agonist clenbuterol into the right BLA, but not the left, enhanced retention, and concurrent <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> the nonspecific DA receptor antagonist cis-Flupenthixol (Flu) blocked the enhancement. Post-training <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine into the right BLA also enhanced retention, and concurrent <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> Flu blocked this effect. Additional experiments investigated whether memory modulation was lateralized to the right BLA. Post-training DA infusions into the right BLA, but not the left, enhanced retention. Post-training <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> lidocaine or muscimol, which impair retention when infused bilaterally, had no effect when infused unilaterally into either the right or left BLA. These findings, together with earlier work, suggest that the dopaminergic system in the BLA is critically involved in memory modulation induced by noradrenergic and cholinergic influences. Additionally, these {{findings indicate}} that the enhancement, but not impairment, of memory consolidation is lateralized to the right BLA...|$|R

5|$|The Colorado ranchers {{used the}} horses {{purchased}} from Colby {{to improve their}} existing ranch stock, and the progeny of these crossings became the Colorado Ranger Horse. Although leopard coloration was not originally an aim of the breeding program, many of the resulting horses bore spotted coat patterns, and breeders began to include the patterning {{as one of their}} goals. Two other stallions also became influential foundation sires of the breed. One was a Colorado-born leopard-spot colt named Max, foaled in 1918. The second was a Barb stallion named Spotte, imported from North Africa in 1918 by the owner of the W.R. Thompson Cattle Company as a wedding gift for his daughter. This stallion provided another important <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> Barb blood, which had been diluted in the breed since Linden Tree had been imported from Turkey.|$|E

40|$|Septal <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A agonist {{muscimol}} impair memory, and {{the effect}} likely involves the hippocampus. GABAA receptors are present on the perikarya of cholinergic and GABAergic septo-hippocampal (SH) projections. The current experiments determined whether GABAergic SH projections {{are involved in the}} memory-impairing effects of septal GABAA receptor activation. Experiment 1 tested whether combining septal co-infusions of subeffective doses of muscimol with scopolamine, a drug that selectively influences GABA SH projections, would produce memory deficits. Experiment 2 tested whether hippocampal <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> a GABAA receptor antagonist would block the effects <b>of</b> septal muscimol <b>infusions.</b> Fifteen minutes prior to assessing spontaneous alternation (SA) or training in a multiple trial inhibitory avoidance (CMIA) task, male Sprague-Dawley rats were given septal <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> vehicle, muscimol, scopolamine, or co-infusions of muscimol with scopolamine, or septal <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> vehicle or muscimol combined with hippocampal <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> vehicle or bicuculline. Septal co-infusions of muscimol with scopolamine significantly impaired SA and CMIA. Hippocampal bicuculline infusions blocked deficits produced by septal muscimol infusions in SA and attenuated deficits produced in CMIA. Combined, these findings suggest that GABAergic SH projections are involved in the memory-impairing effects of septal GABA receptor activation...|$|R

5|$|The breed {{became more}} popular still {{following}} the French Revolution and the aftermath in which hunting {{was no longer}} restricted to the nobility. Although spread throughout France, a large concentration was located in the north west where the weather resistant coat of the breed made it ideal for the wooded and swampy conditions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if caffeine augments the slow-pressor response to chronic low-dose <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> angiotensin II (AII) or the rapid-pressor response to acute <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> AII. AII was infused (125 ng/min i. p.) for 12 d via mini-osmotic pumps in four groups of rats: group I, intact rats not treated with caffeine (n = 9); group II, intact rats treated with caffeine (0. 1 % in drinking water, n = 9); group III, rats previously sympathectomized with 6 -hydroxydopamine, but not treated with caffeine (n = 10); and group IV, rats previously sympathectomized with 6 -hydroxydopamine and treated with caffeine (n = 10). Chronic low-dose AII infusions slowly elevated systolic blood pressure in all groups. Caffeine greatly augmented this slow-pressor response to AII in intact animals; however, caffeine failed to enhance AII-induced hypertension in sympathectomized rats. Caffeine pretreatment did not enhance the rapid-pressor response to acute intravenous <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> AII.

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1943, No. 9 OG, {{originally}} the RAAF's mobile strike formation, had effectively become a static garrison force in New Guinea. Bostock proposed that it be renamed Northern Area Command to better reflect its current function. Kenney asked Bostock to raise a new RAAF mobile formation, {{which led to the}} establishment of No.10 Operational Group (No.10 OG) on 13November 1943 at Nadzab, under the command of Group Captain Frederick Scherger. In February 1944, RAAF Command took over many of the units of No.9 OG, as well as responsibility for the Port Moresby and Milne Bay sectors. Bostock again recommended changing No.9 OG's name to Northern Area, and also proposed changing No.10 OG's name to Tactical Air Force, RAAF, in view of its increased strength from the <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> new squadrons. No.9 OG became Northern Command on 11April. On 14September, Bostock had an audience with Prime Minister Curtin, wherein the latter outlined his preferences for the deployment of RAAF Command, particularly that it should be represented in forward Allied operations, and employed primarily in the support of Australian ground forces. Bostock concurred; Curtin meanwhile authorised changing No.10 OG's name to First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF), with effect from 25October. RAAF Command's complement had now swelled to forty-one Australian squadrons.|$|E
5|$|Endotracheal {{intubation}} {{and mechanical}} ventilation {{may be used}} to ensure proper oxygen supply and provide a secure airway. Hypotension (low blood pressure), which has a devastating outcome in TBI, can be prevented by giving intravenous fluids to maintain a normal blood pressure. Failing to maintain blood pressure can result in inadequate blood flow to the brain. Blood pressure may be kept at an artificially high level under controlled conditions by <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> norepinephrine or similar drugs; this helps maintain cerebral perfusion. Body temperature is carefully regulated because increased temperature raises the brain's metabolic needs, potentially depriving it of nutrients. Seizures are common. While they can be treated with benzodiazepines, these drugs are used carefully because they can depress breathing and lower blood pressure. TBI patients are more susceptible to side effects and may react adversely or be inordinately sensitive to some pharmacological agents. During treatment monitoring continues for signs of deterioration such as a decreasing level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Kaleski's {{standard}} {{was adopted by}} breed clubs in Queensland and New South Wales and re-issued as their own, with local changes. His writings from the 1910s give an important insight into {{the early history of}} the breed. However, dog breeder and author Noreen Clark has noted that his opinions are sometimes just that, and he introduces some contradictory assertions in his later writings, as well as some assumptions that are illogical in the light of modern science. Some of these have persisted; for example he saw the red colour form as having more dingo in it than the blue form, and there is a persistent belief that reds are more vicious than blues. The most enduring of Kaleski's myths relate to Dalmatian and Kelpie infusions into the early Cattle Dog breed. These infusions are not referred to in Kaleski's writings until the 1920s and it seems likely that Kaleski sought to explain the Cattle Dog's mottled colouration and tan on legs by similarity to the Dalmatian and Kelpie, respectively. The genetics of coat colour, and the current understanding of hereditary characteristics, make the <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> Dalmatian to increase the cattle dog's tolerance of horses an extremely unlikely event. There were relatively few motor vehicles in Australia {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, so most dogs of any breed would have been accustomed to horses. The Kelpie breed was developed after the Cattle Dog type was described, so its infusion is unlikely. It is possible that there was some <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> Bull Terrier but there is no verifiable record of this, and the Cattle Dog has not had the Bull Terrier's instinct to bite and hold, which would have been an undesirable trait. Early in the 1900s there was considerable in-fighting amongst members of the Cattle Dog Club, and a series of arguments about the origin of the breed appeared in newspapers and journals of the time. While many of these arguments were misleading, some irrational, and the majority not supported by historical facts, they continue to be circulated, resulting in a number of theories on the origins of the breed. In recent years, information technology enabling the manipulation of large databases combined with advances in the understanding of canine genetics has allowed a clearer understanding of the development of the breed.|$|E
40|$|Young {{hypophysectomized}} rats {{were maintained}} with chronic indwelling i. v. cannulae attached via swivels to a multichannel pumping system programmed to deliver GH {{in a continuous}} or pulsatile pattern for several days. Continuous i. v. <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> human GH for 5 days produced dose-dependent increases in body weight and tail length, without increasing food intake. A comparison <b>of</b> GH <b>infusions</b> by the s. c. or i. v. route showed that the direct i. v. route was threefold more effective. Pulsatile i. v. <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> human or bovine GH at two doses (12 or 36 mu. /day, eight pulses/day, 5 -min duration, every 3 h) produced greater increases in body weight than continuous i. v. <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> GH at the same daily dose. Continuous <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> bovine GH produced a lower growth rate in the second of two consecutive 5 -day treatment periods, whereas the re-sponses to pulsatile GH did not diminish with time. Both body weight gain and long-bone growth were affected by the frequency ofGH pulses; nine pulses per day were more effective than three pulses per day which in turn produced larger growth responses than one pulse per day.
