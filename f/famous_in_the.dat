5|$|A Handful of Dust is a {{novel by}} the British writer Evelyn Waugh. First {{published}} in 1934, it is often grouped with the author's early, satirical comic novels for which he became <b>famous</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pre-World War II years. Commentators have, however, drawn attention to its serious undertones, and have regarded it as a transitional work pointing towards Waugh's Catholic postwar fiction.|$|E

5|$|A Sanskrit scholar Vijnaneshwara became <b>famous</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{field of}} legal {{literature}} for his Mitakshara, {{in the court}} of Vikramaditya VI.

An Englishman Colebrooke later translated into English the section on inheritance giving it currency in the British Indian court system.

5|$|A third North American genus called Stegomus {{was named}} by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1896. Marsh had a long-time rivalry with Cope {{that was made}} <b>famous</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bone Wars of the late 19th century, {{in which the two}} tried to out-compete one another in the field and in {{scientific}} literature. Unlike Cope's aetosaurs, Stegomus was found from the eastern United States in Connecticut. Marsh also recognized Stegomus as an aetosaur rather than a phytosaur in his initial description of the genus. Like Cope, many paleontologists tended to consider aetosaur scutes to belong to phytosaurs during this time period.|$|E
5|$|Kenilworth {{was partly}} {{destroyed}} by Parliamentary forces in 1649 {{to prevent it}} {{being used as a}} military stronghold. Ruined, only two of its buildings remain habitable today.

English Heritage has managed the castle since 1984. The castle is classed as a Grade I listed building and as a Scheduled Monument, and is open to the public.|$|E
5|$|The {{period was}} also renowned for {{ceramics}} and porcelains.The major production centers for porcelain were the imperial kilns at Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province and Dehua in Fujian province.

Individual potters also became known, such as He Chaozong, who became <b>famous</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 17th century for {{his style of}} white porcelain sculpture. In The Ceramic Trade in Asia, Chuimei Ho estimates that about 16% of late Ming era Chinese ceramic exports were sent to Europe, while the rest were destined for Japan and South East Asia.|$|E

5|$|Victoria Wood as Seen on TV is a British comedy sketch series {{starring}} comedian Victoria Wood, with Julie Walters, Celia Imrie, Duncan Preston, Susie Blake and Patricia Routledge. The {{show was}} televised on BBC Two between 1985 and 1987 and included sketches that became <b>famous</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom; these included one-offs like Waitress (popularly known as Two Soups), in which Walters, as an elderly waitress, takes {{far too long}} to deliver two bowls of soup, and regular features like Acorn Antiques (a parody of low-budget soap opera), as well as musical performances by Wood including her best-known number, The Ballad of Barry and Freda ("Let's Do It").|$|E
5|$|William Beebe {{was more}} <b>famous</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States {{than any other}} American naturalist prior {{to the days of}} television. As a {{scientific}} writer who participated in both the popular and academic worlds, he occupied a similar role to the role later occupied by Stephen Jay Gould. Beebe was a well-known figure in the Roaring Twenties of New York City, and was friends with numerous other well-known figures of the period, including Fannie Hurst and the cartoonist Rube Goldberg. Although he was not physically handsome in the traditional sense, he tended to dominate every social and professional situation due to his enthusiasm, intelligence and charisma. As a result of his much-publicized divorce from Blair and his later marriage to Elswyth, he was also known for his stormy relationships with women.|$|E
5|$|Freedom Square {{was located}} {{on the corner of}} Victoria and Morris Streets. It was <b>famous</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s for the {{political}} meetings held there. It was utilised by the African National Congress (ANC) and the Transvaal Congress Party. Many of the meetings were chaired by Trevor Huddleston. Freedom Square facilitated the cooperation between the aforementioned political parties. Here parties worked together against the apartheid regime. Freedom Square in Sophiatown {{should not be confused with}} Freedom Square in Kliptown, Soweto, where the Freedom Charter was adopted by the ANC in 1955. It was in this Freedom Square in Sophiatown that Nelson Mandela made his first public allusion to violence and armed resistance as a legitimate tool for change. This earned him a reprimand from Albert Luthuli who by then replaced Dr A.B. Xuma as president of the ANC. Current remnants of Freedom Square may be found beneath a school playing field alongside the Christ the King Church.|$|E

His involvement in two television programs—The Storyteller and The Jim Henson Hour—led to Emmy Award wins.|$|E
5|$|The Bahamanis {{introduced}} the large-scale use {{of paper in}} administration and began the Indo-Sarasenic architectural style, designed and constructed by Persian architects and artisans, (also known as Deccani architecture) with its local influences in Karnataka. The Sultanate monuments of Bidar and Gulbarga are testimony to their interest in architecture. The Bande Nawaz tombs and a Jama Masjid in Gulbarga which exhibits a Spanish influence are well known. In Bidar, their buildings have Persian, Turkish, Arabic and Roman influences (the Solah Khamba mosque being an example). Rangin Mahal, Gangan Mahal, Tarkash Mahal, Chini Mahal, Nagina Mahal and the Taqk Mahal {{are some of the}} palaces built by them that have retained their beauty. The Ahmad Shah Wali tombs are noted for their decor, and the school of learning (madrasa) built by Gavan in Bidar (1472), with its lecture halls, library, mosque and residential houses are also <b>famous.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> later part of the 15th century, with a growing rift between the local Deccani Muslims and the Pardeshi Muslims (foreign) who occupied influential positions in the kingdom, the execution of Gavan under dubious circumstances in 1481, and constant wars with the Vijayanagara kings weakened the Bahamani Kingdom eventually bringing about its end in 1527.|$|E
