5|$|Duane Allman, and {{his younger}} brother, Gregg, grew up in Daytona Beach, Florida. Gregg was first {{to pick up the}} guitar, but his brother soon surpassed him, {{dropping}} out of high school to practice constantly. The duo formed their first band, the Escorts, which evolved into the Allman Joys in the mid-1960s. When a black friend introduced Gregg to R and soul music, they began to incorporate it into their sound. By 1967, the group spent time in St. Louis, where a Los Angeles-based recording executive discovered them; they consequently moved out West and were renamed the <b>Hour</b> <b>Glass,</b> cutting two unsuccessful albums for Liberty Records. Duane moved back to pursue a career as a session musician in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, while Gregg stayed behind in Hollywood bound by contractual obligations with Liberty, who believed he could hold a solo career. The two were apart for the first time for a year, but managed to reconvene in Miami, producing an album-length demo with the 31st of February, a group that included drummer Butch Trucks.|$|E

The clerk needs to know all the rules of Parliament and is {{responsible}} for ringing the bells during a division (voting). In front of the clerk are the hour glasses. The outer glasses measure four minutes and the middle glass measures two. These glasses are turned when there is a division; one of the four-minute glasses is turned and the bells will ring and the clocks will flash green for the House of Representatives or red for the Senate for four minutes. After the <b>hour</b> <b>glass</b> stops, the house's attendants will lock the doors and the whips will count the votes. Members vote by either moving to the government side of the house for a vote for a bill or the opposition side for a vote against a bill. If there is a division soon after another division, the middle <b>hour</b> <b>glass</b> will be turned and the bells will ring for two minutes.|$|E
500|$|According to Paul Hornsby, {{who played}} with Duane Allman in <b>Hour</b> <b>Glass</b> in 1967–1968 before the Allman Brothers Band, [...] "Beck's Bolero" [...] {{inspired}} Allman to take up slide guitar. [...] After hearing Beck's record, Allman [...] "loved that slide part {{and told me he}} was going to learn to play it", Hornsby recalled. [...] In 1970, Joe Walsh adapted the slide-guitar section of [...] "Beck's Bolero" [...] for a James Gang song. [...] Titled [...] "The Bomber", the multi-part suite also includes a rendition of Ravel's Boléro and appears on the James Gang Rides Again album. [...] Several artists have recorded renditions of [...] "Beck's Bolero", including SRC, the Posies, Les Fradkin, Eric Johnson, and Return to Forever.|$|E

500|$|Gregg Allman's lyrical {{contributions}} to the band's debut album have been called [...] "remarkably mature lyrical conceptions for such a young man, expertly executed in a minimalist, almost haiku style." [...] Allman's inspiration came from his time in Los Angeles {{as a part of}} <b>Hour</b> <b>Glass,</b> [...] "getting fucked by different land sharks in the business," [...] experiencing great frustration among fierce competition. The traditional blues songs were, likewise, regarded as [...] "songs that were so good they couldn’t be left off the album." [...] On the writing of the record, Allman wrote in his memoir My Cross to Bear, [...] "I wrote most of that whole first record in that one week. I had total peace of mind. L.A. and all its changes didn’t even cross my mind. I felt like I was starting all over, which I was." [...] Most of the songs on the album were written at Rose Hill Cemetery.|$|E

In January, the band {{performed at the}} Electric Factory in Philadelphia and the Fillmore West in San Francisco before debuting at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles, representing the Allmans' first engagement there since their days in the <b>Hour</b> <b>Glass.</b> On {{the third day of}} their Whisky residency, the album logged at number 188 on the top 200, [...] "enough to prove that the ABB was more than a regional outfit." [...] Capricorn issued [...] "Black Hearted Woman" [...] as the album’s single, edited down to nearly two minutes shorter in an effort to place on top 40 radio. Despite Ed Och's rave review in Billboard, the single failed to register on pop radio. Rather than employing the standard cover shot for the advertising campaign, marketing rather emphasized the nude group shot, alongside a quote from Och's Billboard review, describing the group as a [...] "bad bunch of electric Southern longhairs." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2016, a live-action {{version of}} Jasmine debuted as a {{recurring}} {{character in the}} sixth season of the fantasy television series Once Upon a Time, in which she is portrayed by actress Karen David. The character makes a brief first appearance in the season's fourth episode, [...] "Strange Case", before finally starring in the fifth, [...] "Street Rats", in which Jasmine enlists the help of Aladdin to locate a powerful item known capable of interrupting Jafar's control over the Sultan. As has become custom with Once Upon a Times plots, creative liberties were taken with the original film, including Jasmine taking Aladdin to the Cave of Wonders instead of Jafar {{and the absence of}} the pair developing romantic feelings for each other, although the iconic scene in which Jasmine is imprisoned in an <b>hour</b> <b>glass</b> is retained. Jasmine's blue outfit was slightly modified for the series. David had previously expressed interest in playing an ethnic Disney heroine such as Pocahontas, Esmeralda or Jasmine on Once Upon a Time, and was finally cast as the third in July 2016.

40|$|It is {{proposed}} that Apollo 14 type breccias lithify by sintering of particles of matrix glass under stress-free conditions. Meteorite impacts generate the heat necessary for sintering. Compacted angular particles of glass with {{the composition of}} an Apollo 14 rock were sintered experimentally. Loose clods of sub 37 micron grains form in several days at 700 C. Synthetic rocks, which texturally resemble the breccias, were produced at 795 C and above in 7. 5 <b>hours.</b> <b>Glass</b> devitrified with increasing temperature. At 850 C, devitrification prevents much further densification of the synthetic breccias after 2 <b>hours.</b> Experiments compressing <b>glass</b> at 500 bars at 600 C produced dense vitreous masses which did not resemble lunar breccias. Confining pressure does not {{play a major role}} in lithifying the breccias. It is concluded that Apollo 14 type lunar breccias form at shallow depths at 800 C+ in a period of minutes to days...|$|R

2500|$|The {{most common}} style of {{monument}} is the simple upright tombstone or stele. These come in four basic styles: round-headed, Gothic, Classical or crosses. The round headed stones {{have a simple}} arched top, sometimes with moulding cut along the edge. They may be decorated with a symbolic motif carved in relief, such as an <b>hour</b> <b>glass,</b> or a drooping flower. The Neo-Gothic style stones have tops that rise to pointed arches.

These included the stone that Edmund Blacket designed for his wife Sarah. The stones of a Classicising style form an interesting group, because while some are carved with elaborate Italianate scrolls and pediments, many are blank templates, with the outlined forms of scrolled shoulders, but with no finished architectonic details.

The beach has some of the finest sand deposits. The sand dunes formed by the blowing wind rise to heights of 12 m above the nearby sea.
