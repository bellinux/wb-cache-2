25|$|The borough's {{coat of arms}} {{includes}} three silver mackerel, a <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Plenty</b> overflowing with corn and fruit on a cloth of gold, and {{the figure of a}} woman, considered likely to be Hygieia, the ancient Greek goddess of health, holding a snake. The images represent the health given from the seas, the fullness and riches gained from the earth and the power of healing.|$|E

25|$|In Greek mythology, the {{constellation}} is sometimes identified as Amalthea, the goat that suckled the infant Zeus after his mother, Rhea, saved {{him from being}} devoured by his father, Cronos. The goat's broken horn was transformed into the cornucopia or <b>horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>plenty.</b> Capricornus is also sometimes identified as Pan, the god with a goat's head, who saved himself from the monster Typhon by giving himself a fish's tail and diving into a river.|$|E
25|$|Religious beliefs often seek to {{identify}} and address the basic problems of human life, including the conflicts between, among, and within persons and societies. In ancient Greek-speaking areas the virtue of peace was personified as the godddess Eirene, and in Latin-speaking areas as the goddess Pax. Her image was typically represented by ancient sculptors {{as that of a}} full-grown woman, usually with a <b>horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>plenty</b> and scepter and sometimes with a torch or olive leaves.|$|E
25|$|Morimono {{designs are}} relics of Buddhist traditions of laying flower and fruit offerings, {{especially}} during the harvest season. This is much like Thanksgiving in the United States, but instead of using a cornucopia or a <b>horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>plenty,</b> artists use an Ikebana container. Containers can be a basket, a wooden structure, a tray, or a typical suiban, or an upright container. Contemporary Morimono is typically designed with fruit, fruit and flowers, fruit and vegetables, vegetables, or vegetables and flowers. Morimono style captivates beauty {{through the use of}} minimum flowers and materials.|$|E

50|$|<b>Horns</b> <b>of</b> <b>plenty</b> are edible {{and sought}} after. According to a Portuguese study, 100 grams of dried C. cornucopioides contain 69.45g of protein, 13.44g of {{carbohydrates}} (mostly mannitol, a sugar alcohol) and 4.88g of fat, amounting to 378 calories. They contain fatty acids, primarily of the polyunsaturated variety, {{as well as}} phenols, flavonoids and 87 mg of vitamin C.|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, Droste {{released}} Grizzly Bear's debut album, <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Plenty.</b> Predominately a solo album, {{the album}} featured contributions from future drummer Christopher Bear.

2500|$|Other {{accounts}} {{about the}} origin of the river and its name are given by Stephanus of Byzantium, Strabo, and Plutarch. [...] Strabo proposes a very ingenious interpretation of the legends about Achelous, all of which according to him arose from the nature of the river itself. [...] It resembled a bull's voice in the noise of the water; its windings and its reaches gave rise to the story about his forming himself into a serpent and about his horns; the formation of islands {{at the mouth of the}} river requires no explanation. [...] His conquest by Heracles lastly refers to the embankments by which Heracles confined the river to its bed and thus gained large tracts of land for cultivation, which are expressed by the <b>horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>plenty.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Figure #5 and #6 seem to {{be closely}} related. Figure #5 is Oceanus or Neptune whose {{significance}} is often seen as one balancing the scene across from #4 and #7, and also an important onlooker, as he represents the realm of water. [...] Below him is a reclined personification of either Gaia or Italia Turrita. The scholars who see Gaia link her with the cornucopia and the children surrounding her, who may represent seasons. It might be odd that Gaia holds the <b>horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>plenty</b> when {{it seems as if}} the horn is not presently producing anything. This supports an argument that she is not Gaia, but Italia, for historically there was famine at the scene’s event. [...] Also, she wears a bulla, a locket of some sort, around her neck, which, again, would seem odd for Gaia to wear. [...] Either way, the children represent seasons, probably summer and fall, as one of them carries ears of corn.|$|E

Lluís Permanyer claims that [...] "the gallery at ground level is the façade's most outstanding feature, a daring combination of wrought iron and stone in which decorative historical elements such as a cypress, an olive tree, <b>horns</b> <b>of</b> <b>plenty,</b> and the Catalan coat of arms can be discerned".|$|R
50|$|Lesteens {{was born}} in Antwerp on 19 April 1590, the son of Gaspard Lesteens and Catherine Jauwens. In 1612 he married Maria Verdussen, the eldest {{daughter}} of his godfather, Hieronymus Verdussen, and set up in business as an independent printer. His shop in the Hoogstraat bore {{the sign of the}} Gulden Pelicaen (Golden pelican).

6000|$|... "Being a horn," [...] said Oldbuck, [...] "does indeed {{strengthen}} your argument. It was an implement of nature's fashioning, and therefore much used among rude nations, although, it may be, the metaphorical horn is more frequent {{in proportion to}} the progress of civilisation. And this present horn," [...] he continued, rubbing it upon his sleeve, [...] "is a curious and venerable relic, and no doubt was intended to prove a cornucopia, or <b>horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>plenty,</b> to some one or other; but whether to the adept or his patron, may be justly doubted." ...|$|E

6000|$|Light old M. de Maurepas, {{since the}} end of 1781, has been fixed in the frost of death: [...] "Never more," [...] said the good Louis, [...] "shall I hear his step overhead;" [...] his light jestings and gyratings are at an end. No more can the importunate reality be hidden by {{pleasant}} wit, and today's evil be deftly rolled over upon tomorrow. The morrow itself has arrived; and now nothing but a solid phlegmatic M. de Vergennes sits there, in dull matter of fact, like some dull punctual Clerk (which he originally was); admits what cannot be denied, let the remedy come whence it will. In him is no remedy; only clerklike 'despatch of business' according to routine. The poor King, grown older yet hardly more experienced, must himself, with such no-faculty as he has, begin governing; wherein also his Queen will give help. Bright Queen, with her quick clear glances and impulses; clear, and even noble; but all too superficial, vehement-shallow, for that work! To govern France were such a problem; and now it has grown well-nigh too hard to govern even the Oeil-de-Boeuf. For if a distressed People has its cry, so likewise, and more audibly, has a bereaved Court. To the Oeil-de-Boeuf it remains inconceivable how, in a France of such resources, the <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Plenty</b> should run dry: did it not use to flow? Nevertheless Necker, with his revenue of parsimony, has 'suppressed above six hundred places,' before the Courtiers could oust him; parsimonious finance-pedant as he was. Again, a military pedant, Saint-Germain, with his Prussian manoeuvres; with his Prussian notions, as if merit and not coat-of-arms should be the rule of promotion, has disaffected military men; the Mousquetaires, with much else are suppressed: for he too was one of your suppressors; and unsettling and oversetting, did mere mischief--to the Oeil-de-Boeuf. Complaints abound; scarcity, anxiety: it is a changed Oeil-de-Boeuf. Besenval says, already in these years (1781) there was such a melancholy (such a tristesse) about Court, compared with former days, as made it quite dispiriting to look upon.|$|E

The theophany was begun in 525 under bishop Ecclesius. It has a great gold fascia with twining flowers, birds, and <b>horns</b> <b>of</b> <b>plenty.</b> Jesus Christ appears, seated on a blue globe in {{the summit of the}} vault, robed in purple, with his right hand offering the martyr's crown to Saint Vitale.

50|$|Inside, {{the shield}} bears images {{symbolic}} of the State. The pine tree in the foreground refers to Idaho's immense timber interests. The husbandman plowing {{on the left side}} of the shield, together with the sheaf of grain beneath the shield, are emblematic of Idaho's agricultural resources, while the two cornucopias, or <b>horns</b> <b>of</b> <b>plenty,</b> refer to the horticultural. Idaho has a game law, which protects the elk and moose, and an elk's head rises above the shield. The state flower, the wild Syringa or Mock Orange, grows at the woman's feet, while the ripened wheat grows as high as her shoulder. The river depicted in the shield is the Snake or Shoshone River.|$|R
