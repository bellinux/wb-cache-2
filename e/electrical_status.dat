40|$|Summary: We {{present a}} family of three siblings. The older two had been given diagnoses of autism by the time the {{youngest}} presented with epileptic seizures. Investigation of the youngest sibling revealed a highly abnormal electroencephalogram which was characterised by <b>electrical</b> <b>status</b> epilepticus in slow wave sleep. The older siblings then had electroencephalograms which were also highly abnormal. All three children demonstrated an improvement in language and behaviour when treated with oral prednisolone. Index case: The index case, a five-year-old boy, presented in December 2014 with a nocturnal convulsive epileptic seizure lasting approximately 1 [*]min. Four limb jerking was accompanied by drooling {{from the corner of his}} mouth. The following morning he was noted to be very different. He was not speaking and was described by his mother as being unusually “quiet and reserved. ” A 24 [*]h ambulatory electroencephalogram was arranged. This showed very frequent epileptic activity and <b>electrical</b> <b>status</b> epilepticus in slow wave sleep. He was treated with four weeks of oral prednisolone. He gradually regained his previous language ability. Repeat electroencephalogram two months later demonstrated a clear improvement, with no evidence of <b>electrical</b> <b>status</b> epilepticus in slow wave sleep. Older siblings: Older brother of the index case, aged nine, had been diagnosed with autism at the age of four. Having gained language skills up to the age of two years he went through a period of regression in speech and behaviour. Since then gradually gained language skills and was able to speak in three to four word sentences at the age of nine. Electroencephalogram at the age of nine was near identical to that of his younger brother. He was also treated with oral prednisolone. Both electroencephalogram and language ability improved markedly. An older sister of the index case, aged eight, had been diagnosed with autism at the age of five. At the age of two she could say several people’s names, several colours and could sing ‘twinkle twinkle little star’. She then lost all expressive language. Electroencephalogram at the age of seven was more abnormal than her brothers’ and also showed <b>electrical</b> <b>status</b> epilepticus in slow wave sleep. After treatment with oral prednisolone the electroencephalogram improved markedly and she started to say the names of her brothers. Message: We would like to use this case to highlight the importance of considering <b>electrical</b> <b>status</b> epilepticus in slow wave sleep as a cause of ‘autistic regression’. We would like to discuss the increasing evidence, particularly from genetic studies, supporting a theory of shared neurobiology between epilepsy and autism...|$|E

40|$|AbstractElectrical status epilepticus {{in sleep}} {{involves}} an electroencephalographic pattern where interictal epileptiform activity is potentiated {{in the transition}} from wakefulness to sleep. Near-continuous spikes and waves that occupy {{a significant proportion of}} nonrapid eye movement sleep appear as a result of sleep-potentiated epileptiform activity. This electroencephalographic pattern appears in different electroclinical syndromes that present three common characteristics with different degrees of severity: seizures, sleep-potentiated epileptiform activity, and neuropsychologic regression. Continuous spikes and waves during sleep comprise the severest epileptic encephalopathy in the electroclinical spectrum. Landau-Kleffner syndrome presents with intermediate severity. Some “benign” pediatric focal epileptic syndromes represent the mildest end of this continuum. Based on published data, we provide a framework for clinical and electrical events. The underlying mechanisms leading to sleep potentiation of epileptiform activity in <b>electrical</b> <b>status</b> epilepticus in sleep are incompletely understood. A genetic basis or acquired early developmental insult may disrupt the normal maturation of neuronal networks.

Patients suffering from oropharyngeal dysphagia in the presence of Parkinson’s disease have been treated with surface {{electrical stimulation}}. Because of controversial reports on this treatment, a pilot study was set up. This study describes the effects of a single session of surface electrical stimulation using different electrode positions in ten patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (median Hoehn and Yahr score: II) and oropharyngeal dysphagia compared to ten age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects during videofluoroscopy of swallowing. Three different electrode positions were applied in random order per subject. For each electrode position, the electrical current was respectively turned “on” and “off” in random order. Temporal, spatial, and visuoperceptual variables were scored by experienced raters who were blinded to the group, electrode position, and status (on/off) of the electrical current.

There {{was no significant}} difference between the etiological groups in term of mean age at ESES onset, mean interval between the first seizure and the onset of ESES. The mean age at seizure onset was earlier in the symptomatic/structural group than the idiopathic ones. The mean follow-up time after the ESES onset was 4. 5 years for all patients. The most effective antiepileptic drugs in our series were clobazam and levetiracetam. In refractory patients, steroid treatment was found effective during the early course of the disease.

A significant increase (3. 2 -fold) in BDNF mRNA was observed 1 h after KA injection (12 mg/kg i. p.) and peak expression (9. 4 -fold) occurred 3 h after KA. The induction of BDNF mRNA was preceded by the induction of c-fos, mRNA (30 min after KA) and {{was followed by the}} induction of calbindin-D 28 k mRNA (3. 5 -fold 3 h after KA; a maximal response was at 3 - 6 h after KA). Region-specific changes, analyzed by immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization, indicated that the most dramatic increases in calbindin protein and mRNA after KA treatment were in the dentate gyrus. Although calbindin-D 28 k and BDNF mRNAs were induced, a 3. 4 - 3. 8 -fold decrease in NT- 3 mRNA was observed by Northern analysis 3 - 24 h after KA treatment.
