500|$|In 2013, Weisberger wrote a sequel, Revenge Wears Prada. However, it {{does not}} seem likely that a film version of it, or any sequel, will be made, as two of the film's stars are not eager to do so. Streep, who has never made a sequel to any of her films, has {{reportedly}} said that she is not interested in making this one in particular. And while Hathaway admits she'd be interested in working with the same people, {{it would have to be}} [...] "something totally different." [...] The Devil Wears Prada, she told Variety [...] "might have <b>just</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> right note. It's good to leave it as it is." ...|$|E
500|$|Major Naspany {{was then}} asked {{what to do}} with the fighters and he responded by saying, [...] "Send 'em to New York City still. Continue! Go! This is what I got. Possible news that a 737 <b>just</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> World Trade Center. This is a real-world...Continue taking the fighters down to the New York City area, JFK [...] area, if you can. Make sure that the FAA clears it—your route all the way through...Let's press with this." [...] Unsure of their target, they were {{directed}} to a holding pattern in military-controlled airspace Whiskey 105 off of Long Island to avoid New York area air traffic. At 9:03am, United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower as the fighters were progressing to their holding position. The Northeast Air Defense Sector was not advised of this hijacked aircraft until 9:03.|$|E

Later, Sasseville explained: [...] "We don’t train to bring down airliners. If you <b>just</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> engine, it could still glide and you could guide it to a target." ...|$|E

5000|$|Players {{generally}} have little difficulty <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> ball, so the main target is not <b>just</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> ball but selecting a suitable type of hit and directing it correctly. There {{are many different}} types of hits used, here are a few examples: ...|$|R

2500|$|During the All-Star break, Walker {{participated in}} the Home Run Derby, placing second with 19 home runs. [...] Both he and Tony Gwynn of the Padres, also a selectee that year's All-Star Game, were batting near [...]400, and right fielders for teams in the National League West division. They were jointly interviewed, as batting [...]400 {{is one of the}} most {{difficult}} achievements in all of sports. [...] Asked just how challenging it is, Gwynn, known to be a very studious hitter, elaborated with what he later termed a [...] "complete dissertation." [...] Walker responded, [...] "I don't know anything about that stuff. [...] I <b>just</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball." [...] While neither player wound up achieving the statistic over any full season, Gwynn won that year's National League batting championship and Walker was second.|$|E
2500|$|Jessica Jones {{has several}} {{personal}} themes that Callery [...] "wove throughout the series", which he {{found to be}} most effective when played on solo instruments—"Whether they were guitar or solo piano, we always found that when the textures and the orchestration were minimal, soloistic, and expressive it <b>just</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> right tone." [...] One theme for the character represents [...] "a light inside of her that is untouched by the cruelties that have befallen her. I stopped short of saying that it’s a happy theme, but it’s about her untouched pure self that she can trust in and is truly hers; it’s one of compassion and of caring." [...] Another is more inline with her outward appearance and personality, which Callery described as tough and resilient, and [...] "something that she totally owns". For the villainous Kilgrave, who is not seen in some of the series' early episodes, Callery [...] "had to suggest his presence without actually seeing him. So initially he had a moody tone to him, which eventually started morphing into a darker theme" [...] as the character physically appears and begins to play a larger role in the series.|$|E
2500|$|Ken Barrington {{started as}} a free-scoring {{off-side}} player, but – determined to regain {{his place in the}} England Test team – he opened his stance and became a defensive leg-side player. In the 1960s he was the backbone of the England team, whose batting had proved so fragile to the Australian bowling in the 1958-59 Ashes series, but he was a match-saver rather than a match-winner, always best in a crisis. The selectors, press and public thought that he surrendered the initiative too much to the bowlers, but a batsman of his calibre could not be ignored. He was a great worrier and had trouble sleeping during a Test match or if he was not out overnight, which led in turn to exhaustion. As a batsman he was a nervous waiter in the dressing room and preferred to bat at number three to reduce the tension. He would smoke cigarettes to calm himself down and would watch closely to see how the wicket was playing. Barrington took his time walking out to the crease and the Australian wicket-keeper Wally Grout said [...] "Whenever I saw Ken coming to the wicket, I thought the Union Jack was trailing behind him". Once there he would inspect the pitch and subject it to [...] "incessant prodding", and would hold up play if the captain changed the field so that he could inspect it. A nervous starter he would make 20–30 runs quickly enough, but gave chances to the bowlers, who tried to take advantage of this. Once settled he would slow down and would sink into lethargy until he neared his century, which four times in Tests he brought up with a massive pull for six. Yet there was method even in this, fielding captains tended to add close-fielders in the 'nervous nineties', so Barrington <b>just</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball over their heads into the outfield.|$|E

5000|$|The group's {{emergence}} at a {{time when}} teen-oriented acts like the Spice Girls and the Backstreet Boys were <b>just</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> top of the charts around the world compelled them to differentiate themselves from the mere [...] "boy band" [...] status that they derided. From the start, they emphasized that they wrote much of their own material, which reflected R&B influences more than mainstream pop roots. [...] "There are major differences musically between groups, not {{to mention the fact that}} we were signed to Motown, which gives us a little more credibility as far as R&B and soul music goes." ...|$|R

500|$|In envisaging how the mind's {{interior}} {{would be}} depicted, the filmmakers {{concentrated on the}} word electrochemical; Ralph Eggleston, the film's production designer, explained, [...] "It meant thinking of things as energy or energy-based, excitable." [...] Each emotion has a glowing, [...] "effervescent quality" [...] to them (particularly Joy), which was difficult to animate {{as it could be}} viewed as distracting. [...] "The characters are created with this energy because we are trying to represent what emotions would look like. They are made up of particles that actually move. Instead of being skin and solid, it is a massive collection of energy," [...] Docter remarked. The team worked for eight months on Joy's [...] "sparkly" [...] aura, but was prepared to delete it, as it would affect the film's budget. However, Lasseter requested that it be applied for each emotion. [...] "You could hear the core technical staff <b>just</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> ground, the budget falling through the roof," [...] recalled Eggleston.|$|R
