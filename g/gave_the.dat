30|$|Parameters of the Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA, Table  2) were {{obtained}} using the Cross Recurrence Plot Toolbox [5, 18]. Values transferred in the function call are the embedding vectors v (i), dimension m, time delay t, size of neighbourhood ε and norm {{to be used}} (Euclidean). A total of 13 features were extracted from each RP (Table  2). Details are given in [3 – 5, 19] or [20]: Clustering coefficient <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> degree to which points of the phase space trajectory tend to cluster. Determinism <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> proportion of recurrent points forming diagonals. Entropy diagonal length <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> Shannon entropy of the probability distribution of the lengths of <b>the</b> diagonals. Laminarity <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> amount of recurrence points forming vertical structures. Longest diagonal length <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> counted length of the longest diagonal. Longest vertical length <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> counted length of the longest vertical. Mean diagonal length <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> average length of the diagonal structures. Recurrence period density <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> periodicity of the signal in the RP. Recurrence rate <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> density of observed recurrence points in the RP. Recurrence times give an estimation of the periodicity in the RP signal. Transitivity <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> probability that two points of the phase space trajectory neighbouring a third are also directly connected. Trapping time <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> average length of the vertical structures.|$|R
