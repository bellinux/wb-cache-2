When the press felt exits the nip and continues around, a vacuum box known as an Uhle Box applies vacuum (normally -60 kPa) to the press felt to remove the moisture so that when the felt returns to the nip on the next cycle, it does not add moisture to the sheet.|$|R

60|$|Austin, {{who became}} {{sensible}} {{that a little}} draught was shaking his duck trousers, did as Jefferson suggested, and the big <b>felt</b> hat <b>rolled</b> and flopped in a ludicrous fashion along the deck. Then it seemed to spring forward into the blackness, and groping after it, he found it glued to the iron grid which was screwed {{to the end of}} a big pipe. It was with some little difficulty he tore it loose. Then he saw Jefferson swing up one hand.|$|R

50|$|Men: In this period, {{clothing}} for men was more conservative. Trousers widened to 24 inches at the bottoms. Knickers, increased the width and length, were called plus fours. In summer, white linen was popular, {{while in the}} winter an American coat—the raccoon coat—was in fashion. The slouch hat, made of <b>felt,</b> could be <b>rolled</b> up and packed into a suitcase. These were very popular with college men.|$|R
50|$|In {{the winter}} of 263, Deng Ai led a strike force from Yinping through the {{shortcut}} over a distance of more than 700 li. As the shortcut passed through mountainous terrain, they had to construct several bridges along the way. The mountains were high and the valleys were deep, which made the journey extremely dangerous. After some time, they were completely cut off from their supply train. Deng Ai wrapped himself in {{a large piece of}} <b>felt</b> and <b>rolled</b> down the mountain. His men climbed trees and scaled cliffs in single file. Deng Ai and his strike force showed up at Jiangyou and caught the defending Shu officer, Ma Miao, by surprise. Ma Miao surrendered to Deng Ai.|$|R
5000|$|Completed in {{the centennial}} year 1876, the {{painting}} was first exhibited at the National Academy of Design that year, then at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. By 1879, {{it had come to}} be known as Breezing Up, a title that was not the artist's but one which he did not seem to object to. A contemporary critic described the painting: [...] "It is painted in Homer's customary coarse and negligé style, but suggests with unmistakable force the life and motion of a breezy summer day off the coast. The fishing boat, bending to the wind, seems actually to cleave the waves. There is no truer or heartier work in the exhibition." [...] Another wrote, [...] "Much has already been said in praise of the easy, elastic motion of the figures of the party in the sailboat, which is scudding along through blue water under 'a fair wind.' They sway with the rolling boat, and relax or grow rigid as the light keel rises or sinks upon the waves. Every person who has been similarly situated can recall how, involuntarily, his back stiffened or his knees bent as he <b>felt</b> the <b>roll</b> of the waves beneath him." ...|$|R

She let her saviour settle her comfortably, and he watched the coming on of another crisis of weeping, still more violent than the first. He watched the {{symptoms}} {{with a sort of}} medical air, as if counting seconds. He heard the guard’s whistle at last. An involuntary contraction of the upper lip bared his teeth with all the aspect of savage resolution as he felt the train beginning to move. Mrs Verloc heard and felt nothing, and Ossipon, her saviour, stood still. He <b>felt</b> the train <b>roll</b> quicker, rumbling heavily {{to the sound of the}} woman’s loud sobs, and then crossing the carriage in two long strides he opened the door deliberately, and leaped out.|$|R
5000|$|No {{unusual occurrences}} were {{reported}} during the take-off and ascent. Around 13:48, as the aircraft reached its normal flight altitude of 24000 ft about 23 nmi km south-southeast of Kahului, Maui, a small {{section on the}} left side of the roof ruptured with a [...] "whooshing" [...] sound. The captain <b>felt</b> the aircraft <b>roll</b> left and right, and the controls went loose. The first officer noticed pieces of grey insulation floating over the cabin. The door to the cockpit was gone, and the captain saw [...] "blue sky where the first-class ceiling had been." [...] The resulting explosive decompression tore off a large section of the roof, consisting of the entire top half of the aircraft skin extending from just behind the cockpit to the fore-wing area, a length of about 18.5 ft.|$|R
6000|$|Neither before nor since have I <b>felt</b> a ship <b>roll</b> so abruptly, so violently, so heavily. Once she began, {{you felt}} {{that she would never}} stop, and this hopeless sensation, characterizing the motion of ships whose centre of gravity is brought down too low in loading, made {{everyone}} on board weary of keeping on his feet. I remember once over-hearing one of the hands say: [...] "By Heavens, Jack! I feel as if I didn't mind how soon I let myself go, and let the blamed hooker knock my brains out if she likes." [...] The captain used to remark frequently: [...] "Ah, yes; I dare say one-third weight above beams would have been quite enough for most ships. But then, you see, there's no two of them alike on the seas, and she's an uncommonly ticklish jade to load." ...|$|R
6000|$|About sunset we got fairly [...] "outside," [...] {{and well}} may it so be called; for I felt thrust {{out of the}} world. Then the breeze began to blow, and the sails were loosed, and hoisted; and after a while, the {{steamboat}} left us, {{and for the first}} time I <b>felt</b> the ship <b>roll,</b> a strange feeling enough, as if it were a great barrel in the water. Shortly after, I observed a swift little schooner running across our bows, and re-crossing again and again; and while I was wondering what she could be, she suddenly lowered her sails, and two men took hold of a little boat on her deck, and launched it overboard as if it had been a chip. Then I noticed that our pilot, a red-faced man in a rough blue coat, who to my astonishment had all this time been giving orders instead of the captain, began to button up his coat to the throat, like a prudent person about leaving a house at night in a lonely square, to go home; and he left the giving orders to the chief mate, and stood apart talking with the captain, and put his hand into his pocket, and gave him some newspapers.|$|R
50|$|Whereas the committee's 1945 {{selections}} {{met with}} criticism only in later years, complaints regarding their moves in 1946 began more immediately. The committee {{had not yet}} outlined the revised voting rules for BBWAA elections, and many observers felt that the BBWAA's privilege of selecting 20th century players was being infringed. It was widely suggested that the committee should either reform the BBWAA's voting rules or eliminate the writers entirely from the process; it was also noted that there was still plenty of work for the committee in selecting further 19th century inductees. Criticism was also directed at the Roll of Honor, which had been created by the committee without any popular request; many <b>felt</b> that the <b>Roll</b> was a backhanded, secondary honor for individuals who had perhaps earned full membership in the Hall, and that the committee had simply established it {{as an excuse for}} inaction regarding non-playing candidates. It was further noted that managers (Connie Mack), executives (Ban Johnson), sportwriters (Henry Chadwick) and pioneers (Alexander Cartwright) were already included among the Hall's members, indicating that it had not been intended as an honor solely for players. Probably {{as a result of this}} criticism, there were never any additions to the Roll of Honor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most memorable}} and unusual moment for Turner was in Locarno, Switzerland. The {{stage for the}} concert had {{been built in the}} center of the town. As Turner recalls, [...] "The stage was {{literally}} in the middle of the street surrounded by apartment buildings with parents and little kids sitting on their balconies in their night robes." [...] Before her concerts at Johanneshov Isstadion in Sweden, Turner got a bad sinus infection and had to cancel her concerts. The arena was sold out and when the concert promoter went on stage to tell the audience, instead of booing the 13,000 people cheered with understanding. When Turner returned, she played to an even bigger audience. In her stadium concert in Ireland, Turner attracted a huge crowd of over 60,000 people. During this massive concert, Turner nearly stopped the show because of fans in the front getting crushed by other fans. The European tour ended on July 26, 1987 where it began in Munich, Germany. Turner recalls", Our biggest crowd came towards the end of the tour in Munich. We had already played eight indoor shows there to about 120,000 people and once I have been to a city, I'm always reluctant to go back soon afterward. Then we attracted another 100,000 people outdoors, I was really quite astounded. It <b>felt</b> like the <b>Rolling</b> Stones when they drew those huge crowds." ...|$|R
40|$|Felt is {{considered}} mankind 2 ̆ 7 s oldest textile. Created of wool or hair through pressure and shocking, {{and the application}} of heat and cold, felt is a warm, sturdy fabric used for shelter, clothing, carpets, saddles, and bags or container covers. Feltmaking is a world-wide tradition {{in the sense that it}} is practiced in such disparate regions as Mongolia, Central Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. In the souk in Marrakech, Morocco, a two-sided prayer rug is created, one side white and one side grey, using the natural color of the fleece. The process involves the addition of soap which acts as a binding agent during the <b>felting</b> process. <b>Rolling</b> and pressure cause the fibers to bind together forming a flat, finished mat. In Central Asia and the Middle East, the biblical bow and mallet is employed to break up the fiber into a cloud-like mass which is laid on a dampened canvas in a given shape. The feltmakers in this area create inlaid coats and carpets for local consumption. Once a coat has been partially felted, it is folded over, and the softly rolled fleece is applied to the surface in a given design. The laminating process continues in order to felt in the yarn design and to shape the coat. The finished garment has closed sleeves which act like mittens. In Afghanistan, where the carpet designs are very intricate, the dyed fleece is laid in a given pattern on a reed mat and the plain black fleece backing is then laid on top. The entire mass of wool is rolled up in the mat and a canvas and felted through continuous rolling and pressure. In Aqsha, an Afgan town very near the Russian border, a carpet market takes place every week, featuring pile carpets and 2 ̆ 2 namdas 2 ̆ 2 or felt carpets. This is my carpet which took me 7 hours to buy. During the price haggling which is, as you know, a ritual in this part of the world, this is the crowd which gathered on my carpet and this is the gentleman who made off with my SS 2 ̆ 6 D - an issue devoted to American Indian rug design. I wonder how many Hopi and Pueblo 2 ̆ 2 namdas 2 ̆ 2 are being created in Aqsha today?!...|$|R
50|$|Kevin Harvick won {{the pole}} {{with a time}} of 26.802 and a speed of 183.479 mph. “I was on the bottom all day in {{practice}} and Rodney felt like {{in order to get the}} pole you were going to need to run the top after we ran our first run,’’ Harvick said. “That is the driver in him that is why he is good to have sitting there watching because he knows what is going on and he can relay. Also having Tim Fedewa up on top as a former driver knowing what is going on to relay what you need to do. We moved up and picked up in the second (session), felt like I didn’t roll through there fast enough. In the last (session), <b>felt</b> like I <b>rolled</b> through there pretty good. It all worked out. Knockout qualifying paid off for us today. We were able to save the best for last.” Harvick's car had to go through tech inspection three times before he could take his car onto the track for qualifying. “It just seemed like the machine was a little bit off there for qualifying,’’ Rodney Childers said of NASCAR’s measuring device. “A lot of people had left-rear toe issues. We rolled through the first time and saw what it was and did what we always do to fix that amount, and we rolled back through again and it read the same thing again, which it shouldn’t have. It’s part of the process. It’s up to the teams to get it right. Different teams have different tools in order to know whether they’re going to be good or not. We haven’t got the right tools developed yet to know that. It’s something we’ve got to work on at (Stewart-Haas Racing). NASCAR works hard every week to try to get their machine closer and closer and more consistent. It’s a two-way street. We’ve got to do a better job.’’ The only driver that failed to qualify was David Reutimann.|$|R
6000|$|But in the evening, in the dog-watches, {{and even}} {{far into the}} first night-watch, a knot of men could always be seen congregated before Jimmy's cabin. They leaned {{on each side of}} the door peacefully {{interested}} and with crossed legs; they stood astride the doorstep discoursing, or sat in silent couples on his sea-chest; while against the bulwark along the spare topmast, three or four in a row stared meditatively; with their simple faces lit up by the projected glare of Jimmy's lamp. The little place, repainted white, had, in the night, the brilliance of a silver shrine where a black idol, reclining stiffly under a blanket, blinked its weary eyes and received our homage. Donkin officiated. He had the air of a demonstrator showing a phenomenon, a manifestation bizarre, simple, and meritorious that, to the beholders, should be a profound and an everlasting lesson. [...] "Just look at 'im, 'ee knows what's what--never fear!" [...] he exclaimed now and then, flourishing a hand hard and fleshless like the claw of a snipe. Jimmy, on his back, smiled with reserve and without moving a limb. He affected the languor of extreme weakness, so as to make it manifest to us that our delay in hauling him out from his horrible confinement, and then that night spent on the poop among our selfish neglect of his needs, had [...] "done for him."

40|$|The problem {{presented}} {{concerned the}} dynamics of a roll press nip, a crucial component in a paper-making machine. Modern commercial paper-making machines are huge items of equipment. They may be {{as long as a}} football field and cost many millions of dollars each. Integrity of the process is extremely important; the paper in such a machine travels so fast (up to 20 km/sec) that a break is viewed as a major calamity and may take many man-hours and dollars to recover from. The size and speed of the machines means that {{it is not easy to}} make measurements as the paper passes through. The hostility of the environment therefore dictates that a thorough theoretical understanding of the important parts of the process is crucial if the processes involved are to be optimized. In this study we do not seek to answer anyone specific question, but rather wish to propose a general framework for modeling the flow and deformation under a roll press nip. Because of the difficulty of making measurements in the nip region and the need to closely control the process, the distributions of pressure, velocity and felt porosity within the nip have traditionally been subjects of great debate. Previous treatments have included lubrication theory models and "Bernoulli" based models. Although some progress may be made using thin layer theory, we shall show the required modeling does not take the form of standard lubrication theory. As far as models based on Bernoulli's equation are concerned, we simply note that the discussion below shows that the drag force exerted by the felt on the liquid is a key physical component of the flow process. Clearly, a full three-phase flow treatment is required. In this study we will thus address the following questions: (i) Is it possible to propose a general theoretical treatment of the roll press nip? (ii) What determines the physics of the water movement within the paper and <b>felt</b> in the <b>roll</b> press nip and how is this connected to the details of the air movement and the deformation of the felt? (iii) When a general model has been proposed, is it possible exploit the geometry within the nip to generate some simple exact solutions? (iv) What are the key non-dimensional parameters in the problem and how large are they likely to be for realistic paper-making machines? A further matter of interest concerns the influence that the size, shape and separation of the rollers have on the whole process. We approach the modeling from a rather general point of view, beginning by including all effects that might be important and then making clearly defined assumptions to simplify the equations. In this way it is possible to make changes to the model if circumstances change...|$|R
