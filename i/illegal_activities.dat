40|$|The {{current study}} investigated: (a) the {{relationships}} {{of exposure to the}} Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA) with reductions in substance use, <b>illegal</b> <b>activity,</b> and juvenile justice system involvement in adolescents diagnosed with a substance use disorder, and (b) the pathways by which reductions in the target behaviors were achieved. This study is a secondary data analysis of longitudinal data from a large-scale implementation effort for A-CRA. The sample consisted of 1, 467 adolescents who presented to substance use treatment and reported past-year engagement in <b>illegal</b> <b>activity.</b> Participants had an average age of 15. 8 years (SD = 1. 3) and were 25 % female, 14 % African American, 29 % Hispanic, 35 % Caucasian, 16 % mixed ethnicity, and 6 % other ethnicity. Path analyses provided support that participation in A-CRA had a significant, direct association with reduced substance use; a significant, indirect association with reduced <b>illegal</b> <b>activity</b> through reductions in substance use; and a significant indirect association with reduced juvenile justice system involvement through reductions in both substance use and <b>illegal</b> <b>activity.</b> In addition, post hoc analyses using a bootstrapping strategy provided evidence that reductions in substance use partially mediated the relationship between A-CRA and <b>illegal</b> <b>activity...</b>|$|R

5|$|The major {{legitimate}} businesses on the island, such as {{banking and}} hotels, {{were able to}} thrive {{in large part because}} of the <b>illegal</b> <b>activities.</b> Though many of these business leaders steered clear of direct involvement in the business affairs of the Maceos and the gangs, their relationships were hardly antagonistic. Some, such as financier, hotelier, and insurance executive William Lewis Moody, Jr., actually welcomed illegal gambling because it brought tourists who filled up his hotels. He was even known to make loans to the Maceos' syndicate.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the revelation}} of the <b>illegal</b> <b>activities,</b> {{expenditures}} had been routinely made on a cash basis, all of the university funding and program money was thrown into a single account, and university bond indentures had been violated.

The first year {{of dealing with the}} situation required 16- to 18-hour days, six days a week, and after that the process still required overtime through the year 1941.

By the early 1820s Quakers in North Carolina were being openly persecuted for the assistance they were suspected of providing to runaway slaves.

5|$|Seven {{followers}} (called Rajneeshees) of charismatic leader Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (now {{known as}} Osho), {{were convicted of}} a 1985 conspiracy to assassinate Charles Turner, and an additional unindicted eighth member of the Rajneesh commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy. The perpetrators were high-ranking followers within the Rajneeshee organization. Prosecutors in the case stated that the perpetrators had planned to murder Turner after he was appointed to head {{an investigation into the}} group's activities in Rajneeshpuram, Oregon. Turner's investigation focused on sham marriages organized by the group, as well as other <b>illegal</b> <b>activities</b> including immigration fraud, and he later headed the federal prosecution relating to the 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack in The Dalles, Oregon. Oregon Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer was also involved in investigations of the group, working alongside Turner.|$|E

He was arrested twice for his <b>illegal</b> <b>activities.</b> Conscripted in 1939, {{he served in the}} Polish Army (Polish 6th Infantry Division) during the Polish September Campaign that year. Taken prisoner by the Germans, he escaped, only to be taken prisoner by the Red Army, which invaded East Poland where his family lived and deported east along with hundred thousands of others. It was also in that period that, on 26 April 1943, he married Justyna Światło, taking her more Polish-sounding surname. He eventually joined the Polish Forces in the East (Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division, Berling's Army), becoming a political officer; he was also promoted to junior lieutenant (podporucznik) and became involved in organising state administration in areas taken from the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Noriega began {{supplying}} {{weapons to}} the M-19 rebel group in Colombia in 1981.

According to some reports, the M-19 also asked Noriega to mediate their negotiations with Columbian drug cartels in February 1982. A 1990 book discussing Noriega's administration stated that he had sold 5000 Panamanian passports to the Cuban government for use by its intelligence services. Noriega's direct involvement in moving weapons and drugs declined in the early 1980s; instead, he invested in legal businesses, and used these as a cover for money laundering operations, much of which were related to the drug trade. The U.S. intelligence service believed Noriega to have amassed a personal fortune in European banks {{as a result of his}} <b>illegal</b> <b>activities,</b> as well as owning two homes in Panama and one in France.|$|E

Operating with 73 water {{treatments}} plants, an average of 1.19billion litres of water are distributed daily to meet Sabahan residents demands. The coverage of water supply in major towns has reach 100% while in rural areas, the coverage still around 75% with total public pipes length up to 15,031 kilometres. The only water supply dam in the state is the Babagon Dam which holds 21,000 million litres of water. To meet the increase demands, another dam named as Kaiduan Dam was being proposed to be built although being met with protest from local villagers who living on the proposed site. Sabah has a natural gas demand of 350 mmscfd in 2013, which increase to 523 mmscfd in 2015. As Malaysia's liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are much cheaper through the subsidy that was given by the federal government, it was found out in 2015 that around 20,000 LPG cylinders in Sabah east coast were smuggled by immigrants from neighbouring Indonesia and the southern Philippines in a monthly basis to their countries that leading to many Sabahans hard to retrieve enough supplies of LPG. As a counter-measure, the Malaysian Ministry of Domestic Trade, Co-operatives and Consumerism (MDTCAC) has temporarily cancelled all permits to sell gas cylinders into neighbouring countries with a new policy will be implemented to control such <b>illegal</b> <b>activities.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral was a 30-second shootout between lawmen {{and members}} of a loosely {{organized}} group of outlaws called the Cowboys that took place at about 3:00p.m. on Wednesday, October 26, 1881, in Tombstone, Arizona Territory. It is generally regarded as the most famous shootout {{in the history of}} the American Wild West. The gunfight was the result of a long-simmering feud, with Cowboys Billy Claiborne, Ike and Billy Clanton, and Tom and Frank McLaury on one side and town Marshal Virgil Earp, Special Policeman Morgan Earp, Special Policeman Wyatt Earp, and temporary policeman Doc Holliday on the other side. All three Earp brothers had been the target of repeated death threats made by the Cowboys, who objected to the Earps' interference in their <b>illegal</b> <b>activities.</b> Billy Clanton and both McLaury brothers were killed. Ike Clanton claimed that he was unarmed and ran from the fight, along with Billy Claiborne. Virgil, Morgan, and Doc Holliday were wounded, but Wyatt Earp was unharmed. The shootout has come to represent a period of the American Old West when the frontier was virtually an open range for outlaws, largely unopposed by law enforcement officers who were spread thin over vast territories.|$|E

However, his mood swings would {{sometimes}} determine how {{he responded to}} patrons. Journalist Herb Caen reported {{that he could be}} dismissive and insulting to those who annoyed him. Giancana was banned from the state of Nevada, but Sinatra continued to allow him to stay at the lodge which resulted in Sanicola seeking to remove himself as a shareholder. Although Sinatra sought to explain that Giancana was only visiting his girlfriend, Phyllis McGuire, the disagreement resulted in the end of Sinatra and Sanicola's friendship. After Giancana was spotted on the premises, Sinatra had his gambling license removed by the Nevada Gaming Control Board. Following this, Sinatra decided he {{wanted to get out of}} entertainment property ownership as he was being heavily criticized in the national press and pursued by law enforcement over <b>illegal</b> <b>activities</b> at the casino. The Cal Neva Lodge was leased to Jack L. Warner in a deal which also saw a majority stake in Reprise Records sold to Warner Bros.
