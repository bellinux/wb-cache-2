5|$|Foreign workers {{brought into}} Germany {{were put into}} four {{different}} classifications: guest workers, military internees, civilian workers and Eastern workers. Different regulations were placed upon the worker depending on their classification.

5|$|A {{significant}} number of non-Jewish Poles also did not trust the <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> decided not to leave the city. Many wounded Home Army soldiers became stranded during the uprising and were simply not able to evacuate in time.

5|$|Almost all of Ukraine {{had been}} {{occupied}} by the <b>Germans,</b> <b>and</b> Khrushchev returned to his domain in late 1943 to find devastation. Ukraine's industry had been destroyed, and agriculture faced critical shortages. Even though millions of Ukrainians had been taken to Germany as workers or prisoners of war, there was insufficient housing for those who remained. One out of every six Ukrainians was killed in World War II.|$|E

5|$|During the war, Italy stopped {{building}} cruisers, since destroyers, submarines, {{and smaller}} patrol vessels were more useful in operations against the Austro-Hungarians. After the war, the anemic Italian economy could not support significant naval construction programs.

5|$|On 14 November, the Germans {{launched}} an assault from Podgorica towards Nikšić {{to clear a}} corridor through which the German forces in Montenegro could withdraw towards the Reich. This operation {{was supported by the}} Italian 86th National Republican Guard (GNR) Battalion. Around 1,200 of Đurišić's Chetniks were deployed on the flanks of the attack. Twelve days of fierce fighting resulted in significant casualties, and the Germans made no progress, losing Boka in the meantime. On 25 November, the Germans decided to abandon this line of attack and attack Kolašin. Chetniks under Đurišić's command continued to fight alongside the Germans. After reaching Kolašin, Đurišić's force separated from the Germans to relieve pressure on the German route of march and headed towards Bosnia, marching {{to the west of the}} <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> bypassing Pljevlja. During the breakout and subsequent withdrawal, both the <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> Chetniks were subjected to frequent attacks by the Allies.|$|E

5|$|On 17 August {{the leading}} {{units of the}} 36th Infantry Division reached Le Muy, which should have {{effectively}} ended the brigade's participation in the operation; however, two of the brigade's companies defending roads in the area were attacked by retreating <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> forced to withdraw to the high ground.

5|$|Pećanac was {{eventually}} denounced as a traitor by the Yugoslav government-in-exile, and the Germans concluded that his detachments were inefficient, unreliable, and of little {{military aid to}} them. The <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> the puppet government disbanded the organisation between September 1942 and March 1943, and Pećanac was interned for some time afterwards before being killed in mid-1944 by forces loyal to his Chetnik rival Draža Mihailović.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Parachute Brigade had a {{secondary}} objective of capturing Le Muy. It {{was supposed to}} have been assaulted by the 4th Parachute Battalion with the 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion providing fire support. With the forces he had at hand, Pritchard was unable to carry out the task. The objective was then given to the 550th Glider Infantry Battalion, which had arrived with the second wave of aircraft. At 02:15 16 August the American battalion moved through the British positions and assaulted the village. The village was defended in strength by the <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> the attack failed, causing several casualties to the Americans. A second attempt at 11:40 was more successful, killing or wounding 300 <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> taking 700 prisoners.|$|E
