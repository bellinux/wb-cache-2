40|$|The design {{arrangement}} of the Experimental Gas Cooled Reactor contains six fuel assemblies stacked vertically, above one another, in each of 232 vertical fuel channels in the graphite core. Each stack of six fuel assemblies is preceded and followed by a <b>dummy</b> <b>assembly.</b> The upper <b>dummy</b> <b>assembly</b> contains a reflector plug and a latch mechanism. The lower <b>dummy</b> <b>assembly</b> contains an orifice with an adjustable plunger capable of varying reactor coolant flow through the orifice. The pressure drop characteristics of the dummy assemblies for eight different throttling positions were obtained in the test program at near atmospheric pressure using an air flow corresponding to Reynolds Numbers of 12, 000 to 60, 000 in the fuel element assemblies. The data of the tests are presented {{in the form of}} velocity head coefficients expressed in terms of the highest velocity head of the two test locations involved for each coefficient. (auth...|$|E
40|$|A {{candidate}} anthropometric {{test device}} (ATD), or crash test dummy, must undergo a rigorous evaluation and documentation process {{before it can}} be considered for incorporation into Part 572 of the Code of Federal Regulations. This process has been developed over many years and includes (1) thorough dummy and drawing inspection, (2) establishment of dummy certification criteria, (3) evaluation of the dummy’s durability, biofidelity, repeatability, and reproducibility, and (4) the generation of a detailed manual for <b>dummy</b> <b>assembly</b> procedures. The evaluation process will be outlined and explained in detail. Recent dummy evaluations for the Thor Lx, the ES- 2 re and the Ten-year-old HIII dummies will be utilized as examples of the various parts of the process...|$|E
40|$|Highly energetic, cosmic-ray muons {{can easily}} {{penetrate}} a dry storage cask and yield {{information about the}} material inside it by making use of the physics of multiple Coulomb scattering. Work by others has shown this information {{may be used for}} verification of dry storage cask contents after continuity of knowledge has been lost. In our modeling and simulation approach, we use ideal planar radiation detectors to record the trajectories and momentum of both incident and exiting cosmic ray muons; this choice allows us to demonstrate the fundamental limit of the technology for a particular measurement and reconstruction method. In a method analogous to computed tomography with attenuation coefficient replaced by scattering density is we apply a filtered back projection algorithm in order to reconstruct both the geometry and material information in modeled scenarios for concrete-walled cask VSC- 24. A scenario where one of the middle four spent nuclear fuel assemblies is missing undetectable with a simple PoCA-based approach is expected to be readily detectable with CT-based approach. Moreover, a trickier scenario where the one or more assemblies is replaced by <b>dummy</b> <b>assembly</b> is put forward. In this case, we expect that this dry storage cask should be found to be not as declared based on our simulation and reconstruction results. Furthermore, we show that the material composition can be estimated if the momentum of individual muons can be precisely measured. Comment: 13 pages, 7 figure...|$|E

Spent fuel verification using the existing Improved Cerenkov Viewing Device {{is becoming more and more}} difficult and sometimes impossible primarily due to the increasing cooling time of low burnup assemblies and damaged fuel in closed bottles. Other complicating factors include <b>dummy</b> <b>assemblies</b> in the ponds, different storage configurations, difficult access and variation in the quality of the pond water. The task to develop a SFAT device for the eleven Ukrainian VVER- 1000 facilities has been accomplished under the Finnish Support Programme (FINSP) to the IAEA safeguard...|$|R
40|$|A {{task was}} {{initiated}} {{to improve the}} energy absorption capability of an existing aircraft seat through cost-effective retrofitting, while keeping seat-weight increase to a minimum. This task was undertaken {{as an extension of}} NASA ongoing safety research and commitment to general aviation customer needs. Only vertical crash scenarios have been considered in this task which required the energy absorbing system to protect the seat occupant in a range of crash speeds up to 31 ft/sec. It was anticipated that, the forward and/or side crash accelerations could be attenuated with the aid of airbags, the technology of which is currently available in automobiles and military helicopters. Steps which were followed include, preliminary crush load determination, conceptual design of cost effective energy absorbers, fabrication and testing (static and dynamic) of energy absorbers, system analysis, design and fabrication of <b>dummy</b> seat/rail <b>assembly,</b> dynamic testing of <b>dummy</b> seat/rail <b>assembly,</b> and finally, testing of actual modified seat system with a dummy occupant. A total of ten full scale tests have been performed including three of the actual aircraft seat. Results from full-scale tests indicated that occupant loads were attenuated successfully to survivable levels...|$|R
40|$|The Short Model Coil (SMC) {{assembly}} {{has been}} designed, as test bench for short racetrack coils wound with Nb 3 Sn cable. The mechanical structure comprises an iron yoke {{surrounded by a}} 20 mm thick aluminium alloy shell, and includes four loading pads that transmit the required pre-compression from the outer shell into the two coils. The outer shell is pre-tensioned with mechanical keys that are inserted {{with the help of}} pressurized bladders and two 30 mm diameter aluminium alloy rods provide the axial loading to the coil ends. The outer shell, the axial rods, and the coils are instrumented with strain gauges, which allow precise monitoring of the loading conditions during the assembly and at cryogenic temperature during the magnet test. Two SMC assemblies have been completed and cold tested in the frame of a European collaboration between CEA (FR), CERN and STFC (UK) and with the technical support from LBNL (US). This paper describes the main features of the SMC assembly, the experience from the <b>dummy</b> <b>assemblies,</b> the fabrication of the coils, and discusses the test results of the cold tests showing a peak field of 12. 5 T at 1. 9 K after training...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} define random {{vibration}} test requirements for Galileo bus-mounted hardware, an extensive vibroacoustics test program {{was conducted on}} hardware available from the previous Voyager spacecraft development program. The Galileo test program consisted of acoustic tests on three configurations of the Voyager Dynamic Test Model bus and shaker random vibration tests on two flight-like bus equipment bay <b>assemblies</b> and one <b>dummy</b> equipment bay <b>assembly.</b> The primary goal of the acoustic tests was to define vibration levels at locations on the bus structure representative of inputs to bus equipment bay assemblies and to obtain response data on bus bay subassemblies for correlation with the vibration tests response data. The {{primary purpose of the}} vibration tests was to determine if the vibration tests excited subassembly responses at least as severely as the bus acoustic tests...|$|R
30|$|The {{raw data}} {{collected}} with the Point Grey camera are 12  bit 1920 [*]×[*] 1200  pixel images. The first correction {{that must be}} applied to such images is for dark current and flat field. Dark current is the signal recorded {{in the absence of}} X-rays. We typically take multiple 5  s exposures to obtain an average dark current. The flat field is the image that is measured with the X-rays on, but without a sample in the beam. The non-uniformity in the flat field includes effects of non-uniformities in the incident X-ray beam and non-uniform responses of the scintillator and the imaging detector. In ambient tomography, the sample is surrounded by nothing except for air. In HPXMT, the sample is surrounded by a capsule, a heater, and layers of pressure medium, plus the containment ring. In order to maximize pixel coverage on the sample for better spatial resolution, we use the pressure medium as the intensity background instead of air. Flat field images are taken through a <b>dummy</b> cell <b>assembly,</b> which has identical pressure medium to the true sample assembly, but with the sample removed. In practice, the dummy is mounted ~ 20  mm away from the high-pressure assembly; flat field images are taken by driving the hydraulic press so that the dummy is in the X-ray path.|$|R
50|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, AA defences for the Algiers area were built up into an {{integrated}} joint-service organisation, with the RAF installing early-warning radar and an operations room, and US Army AA Artillery units acquiring operational experience alongside British units. As the build-up continued, 22 AA Bde could be released from commitments in the rear areas and assigned to airfield defence for No. 242 Group RAF. By January 1943, 58 HAA Rgt had a troop at Souk-el-Khemis Airfield, another at Souk-el-Arba Airfield and railhead, and a battery defending the port of Bougies under 52 AA Bde, while the third battery was supporting the advance of V Corps. Later the battery from Bougies was released and the airfield defences raised to a battery apiece by March. In {{the final phase of}} the Tunisian Campaign (Operation Vulcan), 58 HAA came under 52 AA Bde as part of a mobile AA reserve ready to move up to Bizerta and Tunis immediately behind the battle groups. Some AA guns were deployed 'protecting' <b>dummy</b> armour <b>assembly</b> positions to deceive the enemy. As the Allies moved into Bizerta on 7 May the AA advance parties came under shellfire from the remaining enemy outside the town. The campaign ended on 12 May 1943, with 58th HAA Rgt claiming to have shot down 37 enemy aircraft during its course. Most of the AA units then settled down in defence and training for forthcoming operations.|$|R
5000|$|Gallery owner Robert Fraser {{suggested}} to The Beatles that they commission Peter Blake and Haworth {{to design the}} cover for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The original concept was to have The Beatles dressed in their new [...] "Northern brass band" [...] uniforms appearing at an official ceremony in a park. For the great crowd gathered at this imaginary event, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison, as well as Haworth, Blake, and Fraser, all submitted a list of characters {{they wanted to see}} in attendance. Blake and Haworth then pasted life-size, black-and-white photographs of all the approved characters onto hardboard, which Haworth subsequently hand-tinted. Haworth also added several cloth <b>dummies</b> to the <b>assembly,</b> including one of her [...] "Old Lady" [...] figures and a Shirley Temple doll who wears a [...] "Welcome The Rolling Stones" [...] sweater. Inspired by the municipal flower-clock in Hammersmith, West London, Haworth {{came up with the idea}} of writing out the name of the band in civic flower-bed lettering as well.|$|R
