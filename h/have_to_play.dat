5|$|At {{the time}} NFF awarded an annual license to clubs which {{permitted}} {{them to play}} in the top two divisions. This included a series of criteria that the home venue needed to meet. As Briskeby was severely substandard to the criteria, Ham-Kam was required to apply for annual exemptions. These were only awarded to clubs who were actively working on upgrading or building new venues. If an exception was not granted, the club would either be relegated to the Second Division (the third tier), or would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> their home games at an approved stadium in another town.|$|E
5|$|Criticism {{focused on}} {{particular}} {{aspects of the}} game. Miller considered the inability to save progress a drawback since gamers will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the entire game in one sitting {{if they wish to}} complete it. Rignall described the audio and visuals as being outdated in comparison to games on the Mega Drive and Super NES (the latter platform having already been launched in other regions by the time Super Mario Bros. 3 was released in Europe).|$|E
5|$|During {{construction}} in 1998, Lyn {{and the national}} team played their games at Bislett Stadion—the home venue for Vålerenga—while Ullevaal was being rebuilt. Prior to the 1999 season, where Lyn would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the First Division, Lyn applied to play all their matches at Bislett to cut rental costs at Ullevaal. However, this {{was rejected by the}} municipality, who owned Bislett, because there was not vacant capacity at Bislett.|$|E

25|$|France, as holders were {{automatically}} {{placed in}} Group A, South Korea {{were placed in}} Group D and Japan were placed in Group H. One of the two South American seeds (Brazil and Argentina) <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in a group played in South Korea and the other <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in a group played in Japan. In Pot C, China <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in South Korea (either group A, B or C) which meant that the other Asian team in Pot C (Saudi Arabia) <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in Japan (either group E, F or G). In Pot D, two or three African teams, {{and one or two}} CONCACAF teams <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in either South Korea or Japan.|$|R
50|$|As usual, a {{small number}} of lower-division teams <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> their home matches at {{different}} locations than their usual home grounds. This includes TuS Erndtebrück, who <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the Leimbachstadion in Siegen, Bremer SV, who <b>had</b> <b>to</b> switch to the Sportpark am Vinnenweg in Bremen, and FC Nöttingen, who <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the Wildparkstadion in Karlsruhe.|$|R
5|$|It's not my {{responsibility}} to draw (the audience) in, I just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the character. The way I would perform songs was always about the lyrics and always about trying to speak to everybody and make them watch and believe what I'm saying and I suppose I'm essentially doing that here but I'm {{not looking at the}} audience I'm obviously looking at the other actors.|$|E
5|$|Victoria came to {{the throne}} aged {{eighteen}} on 20 June 1837. Her letters of the time show interest in Albert's education for the role he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> although she resisted attempts to rush her into marriage. In the winter of 1838–39, the prince visited Italy, accompanied by the Coburg family's confidential adviser, Baron Stockmar.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the regular}} season, Boston College was ranked 26th nationally in total defense, and 2nd nationally in run defense. Its pass defense, however, was ranked 106th in the country, and since Boston College was without senior cornerback DeJuan Tribble, who was {{recovering}} from a sprained knee ligament, it was expected that the Eagles' linebackers would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a very good game to stop Virginia Tech's passing offense. Jo-Lonn Dunbar, who had been named to the preseason watch list for the Bronko Nagurski Trophy (awarded to the top defensive player in the country) was expected to fill the gaps and stop both rushing and passing elements of Virginia Tech's offense.|$|E
50|$|Teams {{finishing}} {{second and}} third in the group stage <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the intermediate round {{to determine whether they}} qualified for the quarter finals, or <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the 9-12th place playoff.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the inaugural}} {{year of the}} award, the winning goalkeeper <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> at least 15 league matches in the current season. In 1964, the limit for matches a goalkeeper <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> was raised <b>to</b> 22. In 1983, it was raised to 28 matches, {{including}} the rule that the goalkeeper <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> at least 60 minutes in match for it to count.|$|R
50|$|The Philippines' {{last three}} games were played in the last 3 games; Cambodia and Indonesia <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> 4 games in as many days, while Malaysia, Myanmar and the Philippines <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> 3 games in 3 days.|$|R
5|$|Multiple {{downloadable}} content packs were released. The Multiplayer Havoc Pack {{launched on}} the game's release date of August 21, 2012, and contains five characters {{for use in}} multiplayer: Perceptor, Ultra Magnus, Blast Off, Wheeljack, and Zeta Prime. It also unlocks the associated customization pieces related to these characters. The Dinobots, excluding Sludge, make up the DLC Dinobot Destructor Pack, released on September 11. The Insecticons, G1 Optimus, Megatron, Hound, and G2 Bruticus were released as DLC for single and multiplayer in the Massive Fury Pack on September 25. Players can also purchase specific customization pieces for their multiplayer characters via microtransactions, allowing players to access content they would otherwise <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> to unlock.|$|E
5|$|The finals system {{meant that}} they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> their finals match in England against English Super League club Wigan. The Mariners shocked the club and the league by winning 22–18. That score line would again be {{repeated}} in the grand final qualifier against Australian club Cronulla, another match the Mariners were expected to lose. But the Mariners were able to defeat the Australian Super League runners-up to take themselves to the grand final of the competition. Against {{the winners of the}} Super League grand final, Brisbane, the Mariners were blown away by the competition favourites. In what would be their final rugby league match as a club, the Mariners were down at half-time 26–4 and the final scoreline of 36–12 prevented the Mariners taking out a A$1 million prize.|$|E
5|$|The strongest bids were Memphis, Louisville, Anaheim and New Orleans. As {{the latter}} two had venues in place, they were seen as having an edge on the other two. Both Memphis and Louisville needed public funding for a new venue, and in either city, the team would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in a sub-optimal {{location}} for several seasons. However, {{the construction of a}} new venue was seen as an advantage by the Grizzlies, as it could be tailor-made for basketball, and the team would be able to control all revenue. The team also expected the highest local radio and television broadcasting rights in Louisville and Memphis, and that the two cities lacked other Big Four major league teams, granting the team preferred air times and increased attention from fans and media. A 2000 report from PricewaterhouseCoopers concluded that small cities often had higher attendance than larger cities because of team's professional league exclusivity. It also pointed to the strong support for college basketball in Tennessee and Kentucky.|$|E
5000|$|Monterrey {{originally}} <b>had</b> {{the right}} <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the InterLiga 2004, but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the [...] CONCACAF Champions' Cup 2004 so their spot {{was taken by}} Atlas.|$|R
50|$|The player <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> 2 pip cards. One for {{the first}} round and another one for the second round. Then his cards change into points and he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> {{continue}} <b>playing</b> with the blind.|$|R
50|$|Liga ASOBAL 1995-96 {{season was}} the sixth since its establishment. The league was {{played in a}} {{round-robin}} format through 30 rounds. The team with most points earned was the champion. On the contrary, teams in 12th & 13th position <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the permanence playoff, and teams in 14th & 15th position <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the relegation playoff.|$|R
5|$|They {{competed in}} the 2010/2011 FIFA U-20 CAF Women's World Cup {{qualifying}} competition. They did not advance to the U20 Women's World Cup. They {{competed in the}} preliminary rounds of the 2010 CAF FIFA U20 World Cup. In the preliminary round, they did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> as Guiena withdrew from the tournament. In the first round, {{they were supposed to}} play Nigeria but withdrew from the tournament. They were supposed to compete in the 2010 African Women U-20 Championship Qualifying competition meeting Togo in the first round, but Togo earned a walk over win against Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone eventually withdrew from the competition. The announcement was made a week after the under-17 lost 0–3 to Gambia.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} club constitution, Bayern's colours were named as white and blue, but the club played in white shirts with black shorts until 1905, when Bayern joined MSC. MSC decreed that the footballers would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in red shorts. Also, the younger players were called red shorts, which was meant as an insult. For {{most of the}} club's early history, Bayern had primarily worn white and maroon home kits. In 1968–69 season, Bayern changed to red and blue striped shirts, with blue shorts and socks. Between 1969 and 1973, the team wore a home strip of red and white striped shirts with either red or white shorts and red socks. In the 1973–74 season, the team switched to an all white kit featuring single vertical red and blue stripes on the shirt. From 1974 onwards, Bayern have mostly worn an all red home kit, with white trim. Bayern revived the red and blue striped colour scheme between 1995 and 1997. In 1997, blue was the dominant colour {{for the first time}} when Adidas released an all navy blue home kit with a red chest band. In 1999, Bayern returned to a predominantly red kit, which featured blue sleeves, and in 2000 the club released a traditional all red kit with white trim to be worn for Champions League matches. Bayern also wore a Rotwein coloured home kits in Bundesliga matches between 2001 and 2003, and during the 2006–07 Champions League campaign, in reference to their first choice colours prior to the late 1960s.|$|E

25|$|Liang's {{run to the}} quarter-finals gained him 5000 ranking points, {{boosting}} {{his final}} ranking to number 40 in the world. This guaranteed that he would only <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> two qualifying matches {{to get into the}} main draw of the ranking tournaments.|$|E
25|$|In some variations, {{the playing}} of certain scores, {{especially}} scores involving point cards, might be mandatory and cannot be skipped.
