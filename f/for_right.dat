5|$|After a short {{stint in}} the minors in 2000, Nathan {{spent most of the}} season in the majors, {{finishing}} 5–2 and even hitting two home runs. But he struggled with his control, walking 63 in 93 innings and ending the season with a 5.21 ERA. He was on the disabled list twice: from May 17 to June 6 <b>for</b> <b>right</b> shoulder tendinitis and from July 14 to August 18 for an inflamed right shoulder, necessitating arthroscopic surgery on the afflicted shoulder {{at the end of the}} season. Nathan divided 2001 between the AAA Fresno Grizzlies and AA Shreveport both starting and relieving, finishing with a disappointing combined 3–11 record and an ERA over 7. Nathan improved slightly in 2002 to 6–12 with an ERA of over 5 at Fresno, but finally overcame his postsurgical struggles to return to the Giants in September with 3 scoreless innings in relief.|$|E
