The relationship between experimental EPR spectra and the electronic and geometric structure of the active site {{can be difficult to}} establish, not least because of the low molecular symmetry.

However, radical morphing {{of the aircraft}} leads to increased structural complexities, resulting in occurrence of dynamic instabilities such as flutter, {{which can lead to}} catastrophic events. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to investigate and understand the changes in flutter characteristics of morphing wings, to ensure uncompromised safety and maximum reliability. In this paper, a study on the flutter characteristics of the folding wing type morphing concept is conducted, to examine the effect of changes in <b>folding</b> <b>angles</b> on the flutter speed and flutter frequency.

40|$|Periodic lattices, {{when used}} as {{assembly}} scaffolds, can augment pre-existing 2 D manufacturing techniques to fabricate 3 D structures with heterogeneous materials, components and architecture such as human organs for transplant patients, and micro batteries. Periodic lattices are first preformed and then folded using externally actuating walls that properly constrain the lattice edges. Angular errors of the actuation walls cause the lattice to distort, misaligning components on the lattice panels. Research into {{the response of}} a lattice to geometric errors imposed on the lattice edges {{does not account for}} how much strain energy is put into the lattice during folding {{and its impact on the}} lattice distortion response and magnitude. This thesis shows how design parameters of the lattice can change the magnitude and shape of the twist response of the lattice when external geometric errors are applied to the lattice during folding. A Buckingham Pi analysis was used to show how the twist response of the lattice due to an external angular wall error depends on the torsional stiffnesses of the panels, the initial <b>fold</b> <b>angle</b> of the preformed accordion unit in the lattice and the angular wall error. A FEA simulation study quantified the Buckingham Pi results by varying the torsional stiffness ratio of the panels, the initial <b>fold</b> <b>angle</b> and the final lattice length after folding. The results showed that increasing the ratio of the torsional stiffnesses by two orders of magnitude decreases the magnitude of the response by as much as an order of magnitude and increases the asymmetry by 0. 5 to 1. 5 orders of magnitude. Increasing the initial <b>fold</b> <b>angle</b> by 50 % increases the magnitude of the result by as much as 250 % and decreases asymmetry by 26 %. by Lauren Amy Chai. Thesis: S.

40|$|The {{conformational}} {{complexity of}} linear polymers far exceeds that of point-like atoms and molecules. Polymers can bend, twist, even become knotted. Thus {{they may also}} display a much richer phase structure than point particles. But it is not very easy to characterize the phase of a polymer. Essentially, the only attribute is the radius of gyration. The way how it changes when the degree of polymerization becomes different, and how it evolves when the ambient temperature and solvent properties change, discloses the phase of the polymer.

The middle layer of an origami sheet is a prestrained poly-styrene film with large shrinkage ratios when heated.
