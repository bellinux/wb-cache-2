5|$|A major {{stimulus}} {{to improving the}} accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> time of a fixed location—usually Greenwich Mean Time—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.|$|E
25|$|Many of our {{important}} source documents, {{such as the}} Assyrian King List, are the products of government and religious establishments. They often have a built-in slant {{in favor of the}} king or god in charge. A king may even take credit for a battle or construction project of an earlier ruler. The Assyrians in particular have a literary tradition of always putting the best possible face on history. The tablets or inscriptions in question still have value, though one does <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> slant in mind.|$|E
500|$|It was teasingly {{suggested}} that Isaacs prove {{his devotion to}} Kermode and Mayo's Film Review by having his character say [...] "ukulele" [...] onscreen, which {{was a case of}} [...] "Challenge accepted!" [...] The line, [...] "He's not going to be playing the ukulele in heaven", was uttered, while examining a corpse whose fingers had been badly mangled. [...] "When I did that I got a note from the editing room going, 'What the f— are you talking about?'" [...] says the actor. [...] "I said, 'You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> line in. If I can ever wield my big stick as a producer, I'm telling you I want the ukulele line left in!'" [...] The line was kept in the episode.|$|E

But I understand that's impractical," [...] Daley told attendees at a conference of gun control advocates in Washington, D.C. in 1998, during his third term. Daley {{was a member of the}} Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. On January 17, 2006, during Daley's fifth term, at a joint press conference with Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich calling for a statewide ban on semi-automatic assault weapons, Daley said, [...] "If we are really to make the progress that we want, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> most dangerous weapons that are right here off of our streets." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the help}} of co-executive {{producer}} Frank Spotnitz, {{he came up with}} a new idea. Spotnitz was inspired by an episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show, called [...] "The Night the Roof Fell In", in which the characters of Rob and Laura Petrie tell different versions of a fight they have had. Gilligan said of the idea, [...] "I just thought it was a cool way to tell a story." [...] With two versions of the same story taking up much of the episode, Gilligan knew that he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> plot simple and settled on a vampire story, that everyone would easily understand. Both Mulder and Scully's version of the episode were filmed back to back, utilizing the [...] "exact same sets and camera angles". The RV park that was featured in the episode was formerly the site of a sawmill that had previously been used in the fourth season episode [...] "Gethsemane" [...] that had burned down.|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, Whorf {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the allophone, a word that describes positional phonetic variants of a single superordinate phoneme; in doing so he placed a cornerstone in consolidating early phoneme theory. The term was popularized by G. L. Trager and Bernard Bloch in a 1941 paper on English phonology and went on to become part of standard usage within the American structuralist tradition. Whorf considered allophones to be another example of linguistic relativity. The principle of allophony describes how acoustically different sounds can be treated as reflections of a single phoneme in a language. This sometimes makes the different sound appear similar to native speakers of the language, even {{to the point that they}} are unable to distinguish them auditorily without special training. Whorf wrote that: [...] " [...] are also relativistic. Objectively, acoustically, and physiologically the allophones of [...] phoneme may be extremely unlike, hence the impossibility of determining what is what. You always <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> observer in the picture. What linguistic pattern makes like is like, and what it makes unlike is unlike".(Whorf, 1940) ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{second step}} in his {{argument}} is that in acting according to an economic function, employees serve the impersonal (business, legal or political) interests of an abstract authority, which may have {{little or nothing to}} do with their own personal interests. They <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> two kinds of interests separated, and [...] "manage them" [...] appropriately in a [...] "mature, professional" [...] way. In this way, they [...] "personify" [...] or [...] "represent" [...] interests, and who they personally are, may well be completely irrelevant to that – it is relevant {{only to the extent that}} their true personality fits with the role.|$|E
2500|$|Eden was {{hosting a}} dinner for King Feisal II of Iraq and his Prime Minister, Nuri es-Said, {{when he learned}} the Canal had been nationalised. They both {{unequivocally}} advised Eden to [...] "hit Nasser hard, hit him soon, and hit him by yourself" [...] – a stance shared by {{the vast majority of}} the British people in subsequent weeks. [...] "There is a lot of humbug about Suez," [...] Guy Millard, one of Eden's private secretaries, later recorded. [...] "People forget that the policy at the time was extremely popular." [...] Opposition leader Hugh Gaitskell was also at the dinner. He immediately agreed that military action might be inevitable, but warned Eden would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> Americans closely informed. After a session of the House of Commons expressed anger against the Egyptian action on 27 July, Eden justifiably believed that Parliament would support him; Gaitskell spoke for his party when he called the nationalisation a [...] "high-handed and totally unjustifiable step". When Eden made a ministerial broadcast on the nationalization, Labour declined its right to reply.|$|E
2500|$|This type of {{criticism}} {{was described by}} Jeremy Packer as an ad hominem attack on the stereotypical biker in service of a [...] "rear-guard line of defense" [...] of Western cultural and aesthetic values, perceived to be overrun by the [...] "spiritually poor, oversexed, and insane." [...] Such criticism was rebuked by Washington Post columnist Geneva Overholser as [...] "dusty foolishness," [...] a foot-dragging reaction to progress, in which some critics were hypocritically denouncing popular works in public while, in private, secretly enjoying the greater accessibility and relevance that was bringing in huge crowds, {{to the benefit of}} both museums and the public. [...] Curator and Guggenheim director Thomas Krens defended the premise of the show saying, [...] "We can't focus on Monet and minimalism too much. We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> intellectual vitality of the institution sharp, and I think the bikes do that. They vary the rhythm of the museum and pique your curiosity about what the next show might be. This show isn't meant to be a thumb of the nose at art." ...|$|E
