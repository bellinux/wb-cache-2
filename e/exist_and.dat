5|$|As a {{political}} philosophy, one-nation conservatism reflects {{the belief that}} societies <b>exist</b> <b>and</b> develop organically, and that members within them have obligations towards each other. There is particular emphasis on the paternalistic obligation {{of those who are}} privileged and wealthy to the poorer parts of society.|$|E

5|$|Male bikini tops also <b>exist</b> <b>and</b> {{are often}} used as visual gags. A mankini {{is a type of}} sling {{swimsuit}} worn by men. The term is inspired by the word bikini. It was popularized by Sacha Baron Cohen when he donned one in the film Borat.|$|E

30|$|From the {{previous}} discussions we finally obtain that (S(n+ 1),E(n+ 1),I(n+ 1), R(n+ 1)) <b>exists</b> <b>and</b> is positive. Therefore, solution (S(n),E(n),I(n),R(n)) uniquely <b>exists</b> <b>and</b> is positive for all n> 0.|$|R
30|$|By (4), when E(n+ 1)> 0 exists, then I(n+ 1) also <b>exists,</b> <b>and</b> I(n+ 1)> 0. By {{the fourth}} {{equation}} of model (2) we further have that R(n+ 1) <b>exists</b> <b>and</b> R(n+ 1)> 0.|$|R

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the same {{philosophers}} also claimed that common-sense mental states {{simply do not}} exist. But critics pointed out that eliminativists could not have it both ways: either mental states <b>exist</b> <b>and</b> will ultimately be {{explained in terms of}} lower-level neurophysiological processes or they do not. Modern eliminativists have much more clearly expressed the view that mental phenomena simply do not <b>exist</b> <b>and</b> will eventually be eliminated from people's thinking about the brain {{in the same way that}} demons have been eliminated from people's thinking about mental illness and psychopathology.|$|E
5|$|Substantial remains still <b>exist</b> <b>and</b> {{are open}} to the public, managed by English Heritage.

5|$|The {{existence}} of the total derivative f′(a) is strictly stronger than the {{existence of}} all the partial derivatives, but if the partial derivatives <b>exist</b> <b>and</b> are continuous, then the total derivative exists, is given by the Jacobian, and depends continuously on a.|$|E

5000|$|The Soul {{is always}} awake and active, while one is asleep, shaping wishful dreams. It is one with Brahman. It is everywhere, within and without, it is immortal. This universal, oneness theme is {{explained}} by the Katha Upanishad by three similes, which Paul Deussen calls as excellent. Just like one light <b>exists</b> <b>and</b> penetrates the cosmic space, enveloping and clinging to everything and every form individually, the [...] "one inner Self" [...] of beings <b>exists</b> <b>and</b> dwells in all beings, clings to every form and remains still without, states the Katha Upanishad. Just like one air <b>exists</b> <b>and</b> penetrates the world, enveloping and clinging to everything and every being individually, the [...] "one inner Self" [...] of beings <b>exists</b> <b>and</b> dwells in all beings, clings to every form and remains still without. Just like the Sun <b>exists</b> <b>and</b> its nature is not contaminated by the impurities seen by the eyes, the [...] "one inner Self" [...] of beings <b>exists</b> <b>and</b> its nature is pure, never contaminated by the sorrows and blemishes of the external world. Parts of the ideas in these first two similes of Katha Upanishad are of far more ancient origins, and found for example in Book 6, Chapter 47 of Rig veda.|$|R
50|$|This {{epistemological}} theory {{contradicts the}} traditional theory of solipsism. While solipsists believe that only their individual self <b>exists</b> <b>and</b> {{the external world}} does not, Jára Cimrman confronted them {{with the idea that}} it is the external world which <b>exists</b> <b>and</b> the philosopher's individual self does not.|$|R
5|$|A Sudoku with 24 clues, {{dihedral}} symmetry (symmetry on both orthogonal axis, 90° rotational symmetry, 180° rotational symmetry, and diagonal symmetry) {{is known}} to <b>exist,</b> <b>and</b> is also automorphic. Again here, {{it is not known}} if this number of clues is minimal for this class of Sudoku. The fewest clues in a Sudoku with two-way diagonal symmetry is believed to be 18, and in at least one case such a Sudoku also exhibits automorphism.|$|E
5|$|Although {{set in the}} 12th and 13th centuries, Penman {{sets the}} {{characters}} and narrative in her novels in medieval sites that still <b>exist</b> <b>and</b> can be visited, including castles, churches and archeological areas. Areas such as Aber Falls and Dolwyddelan Castle have important scenes in Penman's novels. In Devil's Brood, Penman sets the characters in scenes {{in a variety of}} medieval royal residences, castles and abbeys, in England and present day France, many of which still exist such as the Château de Chinon, Fontevrault Abbey, and Chateau de Loches.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, the Confederate {{government}} of Kentucky in exile ceased to <b>exist,</b> <b>and</b> Hawes returned to his home in Paris, Kentucky.

5|$|Athletes {{performances}} are timed or measured at virtually all {{track and field}} competitions. Doing so can not only serve {{as a way of}} determining the winner in an event, {{but it can also be}} used for historical comparison (i.e. a record). A large variety of record types <b>exist</b> <b>and</b> men's and women's {{performances are}} recorded separately. The foremost types of records organise athlete's performances by the region they represent—beginning with national records, then continental records, up to the global or world record level. National governing bodies control the national record lists, the area associations organise their respective continental lists, and the IAAF ratifies world records.|$|E

According to Iwiński, {{although}} he enjoyed playing video games as a child they were scarce in Poland (which was in the Soviet Union's sphere of influence at the time). Polish copyright law did not <b>exist</b> <b>and</b> Iwiński, in high school, sold cracked copies of Western video games at a Warsaw marketplace. In high school Iwiński met Kiciński, who became his business partner; at that time, Kiciński also sold video games.|$|E
5|$|Crab dip, {{sometimes}} referred to as Maryland crab dip, is a thick, creamy dip that is typically prepared from cream cheese and lump crab meat. Other primary ingredients such as mayonnaise may be used. Various types of crab preparations, species and superfamilies are used, as are a variety of added ingredients. It is typically served hot, although cold versions also exist. Hot versions are typically baked or broiled. It is sometimes served as an appetizer. Accompaniments may include crackers and various breads. Some U.S. restaurants offer crab dip, commercially produced varieties <b>exist,</b> <b>and</b> some stadiums offer it as a part of their concessions.|$|E

5|$|Dawkins is an atheist, and is {{well known}} for his {{criticism}} of creationism and intelligent design. In The Blind Watchmaker (1986), he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. In The God Delusion (2006), Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not <b>exist</b> <b>and</b> that religious faith is a delusion. He opposes the teaching of creationism in schools.|$|E
5|$|Distant {{regions of}} space {{are assumed to}} <b>exist</b> <b>and</b> {{to be part of}} reality as much as we are, even though we can never {{interact}} with them. The spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is the observable universe. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler {{will not be able to}} interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the Universe that is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.|$|E
