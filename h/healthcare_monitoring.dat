As the number of patients’ requests increases in simultaneously manner, the healthcare hub server located in the village hall encounters limitations for performing them successfully and concurrently. In this paper, we propose the design tasks of the Remote <b>Healthcare</b> <b>Monitoring</b> application for handling concurrency tasks. In the procedure of designing tasks, concurrency is best understood by employing multiple levels of abstraction.
