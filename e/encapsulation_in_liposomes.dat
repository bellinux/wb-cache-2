All of these dapivirine containing liposomes revealed higher efficacy in reducing viral replication than free dapivirine, although {{no significant differences were}} observed between them i.e. irrespective of the presence of irrelevant or J 3 Vhh on the surface. This suggested that the antiviral activities of J 3 were masked by the high dose of dapivirine and that the liposome platform per se is an efficient delivery system for dapivirine.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} of this work was to study {{the reduction in the}} capsaicin toxicity by <b>encapsulation</b> <b>in</b> <b>liposomes.</b> Capsaicin was extracted from peppers and characterized with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

30|$|Employment of nanovehicular {{system for}} {{delivering}} apoptogenic agent to cancer cells for inducing apoptosis has widely been investigated. Loading efficacy and controlled {{release of the}} agents are of the inseparable obstacles that hamper the efforts in reaching an efficacious targeted cancer therapy method. When the carrier itself is apoptogenic, {{then there is no}} need to load the carrier with apoptogenic agent and just delivering of the particle to the specific location matters. Hence, we hypothesize that amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticle (ACPN) is a potent candidate for apoptosis induction, although <b>encapsulation</b> <b>in</b> <b>liposome</b> shell, and surface decoration with targeting ligand (TL), and cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) plays a pivotal role in the employment of this agent. It is well understood that elevation in cytosolic Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]c) would result in the induction of apoptosis. ACPN has the potential to cause imbalance in this medium by elevating [Ca 2 +]c. Owning to the fact that the nanoparticles should be delivered into cytosol, it is necessary to trap them in a liposomal shell for evading endocytosis. It was demonstrated that employment of the trans-activator of transcription (TAT) as CPP eminently enhances the efficacy of endosomal escape; therefore, the platform is designed in a way that TAT is positioned on the surface of the liposome. Due to the fact that the apoptosis should be induced in sole cancer cells, Folate as TL is also attached on the surface of the liposome. This hypothesis heralds the new generation of chemotherapeutic agents and platforms which could have less side effect than the most common ones, in addition to other advantages they have.|$|R

40|$|AbstractEnhanced {{immunogenicity}} of subunit antigens can {{be achieved}} by antigen <b>encapsulation</b> <b>in</b> <b>liposomes</b> and the addition of immune potentiators. In this study we co-encapsulated ovalbumin (OVA) and a Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand (PAM 3 CSK 4 (PAM) or CpG) in cationic liposomes and investigated the effect of the formulations on dendritic cell (DC) maturation in vitro and on the immune response in mice after intradermal immunisation. Co-encapsulation of PAM did not affect the OVA content of the liposomes, but co-encapsulation of CpG led to a decrease in OVA content by 25 %. After liposomal encapsulation, both ligands retained the ability to activate TLR-transfected HEK cells, though PAM only induced activation at elevated concentrations. DC maturation induced by liposome-based adjuvant formulations was superior compared to the free adjuvants. Encapsulation of PAM and CpG in liposomes did not influence the total IgG titres compared to the antigen/adjuvant solution, but OVA/CpG liposomes shifted the IgG 1 /IgG 2 a balance more to the direction of IgG 2 a compared to non-encapsulated CpG. Moreover, only this formulation resulted in IFN-γ production by restimulated splenocytes from immunised mice. These data show that co-encapsulation of antigen and immune potentiator in cationic liposomes, can affect the type of immune response generated after intradermal immunisation...|$|E
40|$|Anionic liposomes {{containing}} doxorubicin {{were evaluated}} in mice for therapeutic potential {{in reducing the}} risks of chronic cardiotoxicity characteristic of long-term high-dose anthracycline therapy. Doxorubicin first was complexed to phosphatidylcholine and then entrapped in anionic vesicles. Quantitation of myocardial injury was accomplished through examination of thin sections of cardiac tissue by light microscopy. At treatment levels of either 20 or 40 mg/kg (total dose), mice receiving liposomal doxorubicin had toxicity scores indistinguishable from or only slightly greater than those of saline-treated controls. Similar total doses of free drug produced moderate to severe myocardial damage and yielded much higher toxicity scores. Mixture of free doxorubicin with empty liposomes did not alleviate cardiac toxicity, indicating that the drug must be entrapped within phospholipid vesicles for reduction in toxicity. The inhibition of body growth produced by free doxorubicin at both dose levels was also completely eliminated by <b>encapsulation</b> <b>in</b> <b>liposomes.</b> Doxorubicin liposomes were also tested for chemotherapeutic potential against L- 1210 and P- 388 murine leukemias. In all cases, treatment with liposomal doxorubicin produced increases in life-span greater than that observed for free drug.

In vitro synthesized PtNPs were characterized by dynamic light scattering (PtNPs size range 4. 8 - 11. 7 nm), zeta potential measurements (- 15 mV at pH 7. 4), X-ray fluorescence, UV/vis spectrophotometry and atomic absorption spectrometry.

40|$|Effective {{liposomal}} {{formulations of}} vinorelbine (5 ′ nor-anhydro-vinblastine; VRL) have been elusive due to vinorelbine's hydrophobic structure and resulting difficulty in stabilizing the drug inside the nanocarrier. Triethylammonium salts of several polyanionic trapping agents were used initially to prepare minimally pegylated nanoliposomal vinorelbine formulations {{with a wide}} range of drug release rates. Sulfate, poly(phosphate), and sucrose octasulfate were used to stabilize vinorelbine intraliposomally while in circulation, with varying degrees of effectiveness. The release rate of vinorelbine from the liposomal carrier was affected by both the chemical nature of the trapping agent and the resulting drug-to-lipid ratio, with liposomes prepared using sucrose octasulfate displaying the longest half-life in circulation (9. 4 h) and in vivo retention in the nanoparticle (t 1 / 2 = 27. 2 h). Efficacy was considerably improved in both a human colon carcinoma (HT- 29) and a murine (C- 26) colon carcinoma model when vinorelbine was stably encapsulated in liposomes using triethylammonium sucrose octasulfate. Early difficulties in preparing highly pegylated formulations were later overcome by substituting a neutral distearoylglycerol anchor for the more commonly used anionic distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine anchor. The new pegylated nanoliposomal vinorelbine displayed high encapsulation efficiency and in vivo drug retention, and it was highly active against human breast and lung tumor xenografts.

The administration of VCR encapsulated in liposomes was able to sensitize M 14 /R tumors to the drug, the antitumoral effect being comparable to that Observed in M 14 tumors after the same treatment.

40|$|AbstractThe {{therapeutic}} {{activity of}} a wide variety of drugs is significantly improved when their longevity in the circulation is extended by <b>encapsulation</b> <b>in</b> <b>liposomes.</b> To improve the retention of cationic drugs in liposomes, we have investigated the effect of the cationic lipid stearylamine on the permeability of the calcium channel blocker verapamil and the antipsychotic drug prochlorperazine, both of which are also multidrug resistance modulators. Both drugs were efficiently incorporated into liposomes composed of DSPC/cholesterol that possessed a transmembrane pH gradient (inside acidic). However, the efflux of the loaded drugs was relatively rapid (i. e., 50 % of the encapsulated verapamil was released after 4 h at 37 °C), despite the presence of a 3 unit pH gradient (pHi = 4. 0, pHo = 7. 5) Drug retention within the liposomes was improved by increasing the magnitude of the transmembrane pH gradient to approx. 5 units (pHi = 2. 0, pHo = 7. 5). Further improvements in drug retention were achieved by the addition of 10 mol% of the cationic lipid stearylamine in the DSPC/cholesterol liposomes. The combination of the 5 unit pH gradient and stearylamine resulted in increases of the retention of verapamil and prochlorperazine by approx. 20 - and 5 -fold, respectively. Calculation of the permeability coefficients for the charged (cationic) and neutral forms of the drugs indicated that the neutral forms of both drugs were approx. 104 -fold more permeable than were the cationic forms of the drugs. Further, the presence of stearylamine reduced the permeability coefficient for the cationic species of the drugs by approximately an order of magnitude, but had no effect on the neutral species of the drugs. The efflux curves observed for both verapamil and prochlorperazine could be mathematically modeled by assuming that the primary influence of stearylamine was on the development of a positive surface charge density on the inner monolayer of the liposome. Taken in sum, these results indicate that stearylamine is effective at decreasing the leakage of cationic drugs from liposomes, and may prove to be a valuable component of liposomal drug formulations...|$|E
40|$|Anoxia-reoxygenation {{leads to}} severe {{metabolic}} alterations, which {{result in a}} generalized inflammatory reaction and multiple organ dysfunction. Direct blood transfusion limits these alterations, but is accompanied by risk of transmission of infections or viral diseases. To avoid these risks, "blood substitutes" have been designed. The modified hemoglobins are not true blood substitutes {{because they do not}} possess the complex functions of erythrocytes. They are only oxygen carriers, with a short intravascular life, adapted for temporary use. They are stable, devoid of toxicity and antigenicity, and are able to carry and deliver O 2 without regulation of this oxygen transport and without chemical reaction with O 2. They possess rheologic properties and an oncotic pressure like those of blood. The use of natural hemoglobin solutions, obtained after lysis of erythrocytes, remains "at risk" because these solutions easily form methemoglobin, increase the oncotic pressure, present renal toxicity, and possess a too high affinity for O 2. For these reasons, 5 types of modified hemoglobin solutions have been designed, prepared from human or bovine hemoglobin or by genetic engineering. These hemoglobins are highly purified to eliminate trace amounts of stroma, lipids and endotoxins, which are responsible for acute toxicity. They are modified by internal cross-linking between the monomers, or by binding to macromolecules. Afterwards, they can be polymerized or encapsulated in liposomes. The purpose of these modifications is to modulate the affinity for O 2 (by decreasing the binding of O 2 and increasing its delivery to tissue), to reduce the dissociation into monomers and to guard against oxidation into methemoglobin. <b>Encapsulation</b> <b>in</b> <b>liposomes</b> allows co-encapsulation of effector molecules and protective substances. Genetic engineering allows the production of recombinant hemoglobin with selective modifications. The modified hemoglobin solutions are essentially used in hemorrhagic shock and perioperative hemodilution. Experimental work in animals has afforded good results: restoration of normal O 2 pressure and no toxicity. These assays allow frequent observation of an unexpected rapid hypertensive effect, transient, reversible, and that could be controlled by antihypertensive drugs. The mechanisms of this hypertensive effect remain controverted (stimulation of endothelin production, inhibition of nitric oxide effects, etc.). In humans, studies with healthy volunteers have been completed, while phase II clinical studies are under way in hypovolemic shock, in major abdominal, orthopedic and cardiac surgery, in stroke and in intensive care patients after surgery. The detailed results are awaited, but the modified hemoglobin solutions already appear to be without toxicity and present the same hypertensive effect as observed in animals. However, until now only low doses have been used, and the catabolism of these solutions remains largely unknown. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Evidence is presented here that free or liposome-encapsulated RTS,S, a particulate malaria antigen consisting of hepatitis B particles coexpressed with epitopes from the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein, also was localized in the trans-Golgi after incubation with BMs, suggesting processing by the class I pathway.

Therefore, intracellular delivery of antigen containing CTL epitopes to the Golgi of BMs does not necessarily result in a CTL response in vivo unless an additional adjuvant, such as liposomes containing lipid A, is utilized. <b>Encapsulation</b> of RTS,S <b>in</b> <b>liposomes</b> containing monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of the NANP-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody response {{compared to that of}} free RTS,S.

Stability of the liposome to heat was also tested and demonstrated that above 37 °C nisin was released from the melted liposomes to form zones of inhibition.

40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) {{are able}} to present glycolipids to {{invariant}} natural killer T (iNKT) cells in vivo. Very few compounds {{have been found to}} stimulate iNKT cells, and of these, the best characterised is the glycolipid a-galactosylceramide, which stimulates the production of large quantities of interferon-gamma (IFN-?) and interleukin- 4 (IL- 4). However, aGalCer leads to overstimulation of iNKT cells. It has been demonstrated that the aGalCer analogue, threitol ceramide (ThrCer 2), successfully activates iNKT cells and overcomes the problematic iNKT cell activation-induced anergy. In this study, ThrCer 2 has been inserted into the bilayers of liposomes composed of a neutral lipid, 1, 2 -distearoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DSPC), or dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA), a cationic lipid. Incorporation efficiencies of ThrCer within the liposomes was 96 % for DSPC liposomes and 80 % for DDA liposomes, with the vesicle size (large multilamellar vs. small unilamellar vesicles) making no significant difference. Langmuir-Blodgett studies suggest that both DSPC and DDA stack within the monolayer co-operatively with the ThrCer molecules with no condensing effect. In terms of cellular responses, IFN-? secretion was higher for cells treated with small DDA liposomes compared with the other liposome formulations, suggesting that ThrCer <b>encapsulation</b> <b>in</b> this <b>liposome</b> formulation resulted <b>in</b> a higher uptake by DCs...|$|R

When contained <b>in</b> <b>liposomes,</b> 100 - to 1000 -fold lower antigen amounts were as efficient in inducing proliferation and effector functions of CD 4 and CD 8 T cells in draining lymph nodes as other antigen forms. CD 11 c(+) /CD 11 b(+) /CD 205 (mod) /CD 8 alpha(-) DC that captured liposomes were activated and presented this form of antigen in an MHC class I- and class II-restricted manner. CD 4 T cells differentiated into Th 1 and Th 2 effector cells. Primary expansion and cytotoxic activity of CD 8 T cells were CD 4 T cell-dependent and required the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP).

Using micromechanical assays based on micropipette manipulation, we have quantitatively monitored the different phases of the photo-response, which include membrane area variation, osmotic swelling, membrane cross-linking and vesicle deflation. We have thus gained insight into the complex cascade of chemical reactions involved in photosensitization.

We have previously described a novel, rationally designed, pH-sensitive liposomal carrier for gentamicin that has superior in vitro efficacy against intracellular infections compared to the efficacies of both free gentamicin and non-pH-sensitive liposomal controls. This liposomal carrier demonstrated pH-sensitive fusion that was dependent on the presence of unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and the pH-sensitive lipid N-succinyldioleoyl-PE. The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the free and liposomal gentamicin were examined in mice bearing a systemic Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection. <b>Encapsulation</b> of gentamicin <b>in</b> pH-sensitive <b>liposomes</b> significantly increased the concentrations of the drug in plasma compared to those of free gentamicin. Furthermore, the levels of accumulation of drug in the infected liver and spleen were increased by 153 - and 437 -fold, respectively, as a result of liposomal encapsulation. The increased accumulation of gentamicin in the liver and spleen effected by liposomal delivery was associated with 104 -fold greater antibacterial activity than that associated with free gentamicin in a murine salmonellosis model.

This approach circumvents problems of extracellular degradation by nucleases and poor membrane permeability which free phosphodiester oligonucleotides are subject to, but leaves unresolved the inefficiency of <b>encapsulation</b> of oligonucleotides <b>in</b> <b>liposomes.</b> We have coupled oligonucleotides to cholesterol via a reversible disulfide bond. This modification of oligonucleotides improved their association with immunoliposomes {{by a factor of}} about 10 in comparison to unmodified oligonucleotides. The presence of cholesteryl-modified oligonucleotides incorporated in the bilayer of liposomes did not interfere with the coupling of the targeting protein to the liposome surface. Free or cholesterol coupled oligonucleotides associated with liposomes and directed against the tat gene of HIV- 1 were tested for inhibition of HIV- 1 proliferation in acutely infected cells. We demonstrate that the cholesteryl-modified as well as unmodified oligonucleotides acquire the target specificity of the antibody on the liposome. Their antiviral activity when delivered into cells is sequence-specific. The activity of these modified or unmodified oligonucleotides to inhibit the replication of HIV was the same on an equimolar basis (EC 50 around 0. 1 μM).

The main limitation of using this active compound is the rapid inactivation of deoxycytidine deaminase following administration in vivo. Consequently, different strategies based on its encapsulation/complexation in innovative vesicular colloidal carriers have been investigated, with interesting results in terms of increased pharmacological activity, plasma half-life, and tumor localization, in addition to decreased side effects. This review focuses on the specific approaches used, based on the <b>encapsulation</b> of gemcitabine <b>in</b> <b>liposomes,</b> with particular attention to the results obtained during the last 5 years.

However, the selectivity of phosphonoacetate could be increased by reducing the drug-to-lipid ratio. Liposome uptake by Vero cells, measured by the cell association of a nonexchangeable radiolabeled lipid, plateaued after 24 h of incubation and saturated at 60 nmol of lipid per mg of cellular protein at a lipid concentration of 300 microM. The saturation of liposome uptake on the Vero cells may account for the 27 -fold increase in selectivity observed with the liposomal phosphonoformate. The greater activity of the encapsulated phosphono compounds is most likely due to their increased transport into the cytoplasm; this occurs subsequent to the uptake and processing of the <b>liposome</b> <b>in</b> the lysosomes of the cell.
