5|$|Some <b>have</b> <b>interpreted</b> Bahá'u'lláh's writing {{style to}} {{conclude}} that Bahá'u'lláh had claimed divinity. Bahá'u'lláh, however, states himself that the essence of God will never descend into the human world. Statements where Bahá'u'lláh speaks with the voice of God are meant {{that he is not}} actually God, but that he is speaking with the attributes of God.|$|E
5|$|After de l'Orme died in 1570, Catherine {{abandoned}} his {{design for a}} freestanding house with courtyards. To his unfinished wing she added a pavilion that extended the building towards the river. This was built in a less experimental style by Jean Bullant. Bullant attached columns to his pavilion, as advocated in his 1564 book on the classical orders, to mark proportion. Some commentators <b>have</b> <b>interpreted</b> his different approach as a criticism of de l'Orme's departures from the style of Roman monuments.|$|E
5|$|It {{is found}} in Upper Cretaceous {{formations}} {{of central and eastern}} Asia; fossils have been found in Mongolia, Kazakhstan and China. In the Nanxiong formation in Southern China, Macroolithus fossils range up to and possibly over the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, which is traditionally assumed to mark the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. Some paleontologists <b>have</b> <b>interpreted</b> the record of dinosaur eggs at this formation as supporting a gradual extinction event, rather than a sudden cataclysmic event. However, other paleontologists believe that these interpretations are merely based on artifacts of erosion and redeposition in the early Paleogene.|$|E

It grossed $82.4 {{million at the}} box office worldwide. Although a box office hit, it received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its atmosphere and tension, and others criticizing its script and characters. Contemporary film scholars <b>have</b> <b>interpreted</b> the film as a criticism of the perceived safety of pastoral life, as well as an exploration of stranger-on-stranger violence.|$|E
5|$|The German {{occupation}} of Luxembourg in World War I {{was the first}} of two military occupations of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg by Germany in the twentieth century. From August 1914 until the end of World War I on 11 November 1918, Luxembourg was under full occupation by the German Empire. The German government justified the occupation by citing the need to support their armies in neighbouring France, although many Luxembourgers, contemporary and present, <b>have</b> <b>interpreted</b> German actions otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} Stars was likely {{influenced}} by Escher's own interest in both geometry and astronomy, {{by a long}} history of using geometric forms to model the heavens, and by a drawing style used by Leonardo da Vinci. Commentators <b>have</b> <b>interpreted</b> the cage's compound shape as a reference to double and triple stars in astronomy, or to twinned crystals in crystallography. The image contrasts the celestial order of its polyhedral shapes with the more chaotic forms of biology.|$|E

5|$|The {{foggy weather}} made it {{difficult}} to see positions from either side, but Frederick and his commanders used the fog to their advantage. Leaving a cavalry unit and a cluster of infantry in front of the northernmost end of the Austrian line (the Austrian right), Frederick deployed the remainder (and bulk) of his forces toward Leuthen itself; Charles saw them start their redeployment, and may <b>have</b> <b>interpreted</b> the maneuver as withdrawal, at least for a while.|$|E
5|$|The term baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit {{originates}} in the New Testament, and all Christian traditions {{accept it as}} a theological concept. Nevertheless, different Christian denominations and traditions <b>have</b> <b>interpreted</b> its meaning {{in a variety of}} ways due to differences in the doctrines of salvation and ecclesiology. As a result, Spirit baptism has been variously defined as part of the sacraments of initiation into the church, as being synonymous with regeneration, as being synonymous with Christian perfection, or as being a second work of grace that empowers a person for Christian life and service.|$|E
5|$|While these Irish bulls {{have led}} many writers to portray Roche as a buffoon, other biographers <b>have</b> <b>interpreted</b> them not as blunders, but as {{calculated}} attempts to disarm opposition to ministerial policies through humour.

5|$|From 1000 onwards, {{references}} to castles in texts such as charters increased greatly. Historians <b>have</b> <b>interpreted</b> this {{as evidence of}} a sudden {{increase in the number}} of castles in Europe around this time; this has been supported by archaeological investigation which has dated the construction of castle sites through the examination of ceramics. The increase in Italy began in the 950s, with numbers of castles increasing by a factor of three to five every 50years, whereas in other parts of Europe such as France and Spain the growth was slower. In 950 Provence was home to 12castles, by 1000 this figure had risen to 30, and by 1030 it was over 100. Although the increase was slower in Spain, the 1020s saw a particular growth in the number of castles in the region, particularly in contested border areas between Christian and Muslim.|$|E
5|$|Historians <b>have</b> <b>interpreted</b> the {{widespread}} presence of castles across Europe in the 11thand 12thcenturies {{as evidence that}} warfare was common, and usually between local lords. Castles were introduced into England shortly before the Norman Conquest in 1066. Before the 12thcentury, castles were as uncommon in Denmark {{as they had been}} in England before the Norman Conquest. The introduction of castles to Denmark was a reaction to attacks from Wendish pirates, and they were usually intended as coastal defences. The motte and bailey remained the dominant form of castle in England, Wales, and Ireland well into the 12thcentury. At the same time, castle architecture in mainland Europe became more sophisticated.|$|E
5|$|The Shiva-related {{tradition}} {{is a major}} part of Hinduism, found all over India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bali (Indonesia). Its historical roots are unclear and contested. Some scholars such Yashodhar Mathpal and Ali Javid <b>have</b> <b>interpreted</b> early prehistoric paintings at the Bhimbetka rock shelters, carbon dated to be from pre-10,000 BCE period, as Shiva dancing, Shiva's trident, and his mount Nandi. However, Howard Morphy states that these prehistoric rock paintings of India, when seen in their context, are likely those of hunting party with animals, and that the figures in a group dance can be interpreted in many different ways. Rock paintings from Bhimbetka, depicting a figure with a trishul, have been described as Nataraja by Erwin Neumayer, who dates them to the mesolithic.|$|E

5|$|The main sub-traditions of Jainism have {{historically}} disagreed, with Digambaras (sky-clad, naked mendicant order) stating {{that a woman}} is by her nature and her body unable to practice asceticism, such as by living naked, and therefore she cannot achieve spiritual liberation because of her gender. She can at best, state the Digambara texts, live an ethical life so that she is reborn as {{a man in a}} future life. In this view, she is also viewed a threat to a monk's chastity. In contrast, Svetambaras (white-clad, wear clothes) <b>have</b> <b>interpreted</b> Mahavira's teaching as encouraging both males and females to pursue a mendicant ascetic life with the possibility of moksha (kaivalya, spiritual liberation) regardless of gender.|$|E
5|$|Rock art {{is found}} {{throughout}} the Mesa Verde region, but its dispersion is uneven and periodic. Some locations have numerous examples; others have none, and some periods saw prolific creation, while others saw little. Styles also vary over time. Examples are relatively rare on Mesa Verde proper, but abundant in the middle San Juan River area, which might indicate the river's importance as a travel route and key source of water. Common motifs in the rock art of the region include, anthropomorphic figures in procession and during copulation or childbirth, handprints, animal and people tracks, wavy lines, spirals, concentric circles, animals, and hunting scenes. As the region's population plummeted during the late 13th century, the subject of Mesa Verdean rock art increasingly shifted to depictions of shields, warriors, and battle scenes. Modern Hopi <b>have</b> <b>interpreted</b> the petroglyphs at Mesa Verde's Petroglyph Point as depictions of various clans of people.|$|E
5|$|The {{long and}} narrow skull was small in {{proportion}} to the body. It had a small antorbital fenestra, the hole between the nose and eye common to most archosaurs, including modern birds, though lost in extant crocodylians. The skull's low position suggests that Stegosaurus may have been a browser of low-growing vegetation. This interpretation is supported by the absence of front teeth and their likely replacement by a horny beak or rhamphotheca. The lower jaw of Stegosaurus jaws of Stegosaurus had flat downward and upward extensions that would have completely hidden the teeth when viewed from the side, and these probably supported a turtle-like beak in life. The presence of a beak extended along much of the jaws may have precluded the presence of cheeks in these species. Such an extensive beak was probably unique to Stegosaurus and some other advanced stegosaurids among ornithischians, which usually had beaks restricted to the jaw tips. Other researchers <b>have</b> <b>interpreted</b> these ridges as modified versions of similar structures in other ornithischians which might have supported fleshy cheeks, rather than beaks. Stegosaurian teeth were small, triangular, and flat; wear facets show that they did grind their food.|$|E
