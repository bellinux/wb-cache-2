5|$|Boletus edulis is a {{food source}} <b>for</b> <b>animals</b> {{such as the}} banana slug (Ariolimax columbianus), the {{long-haired}} grass mouse, the red squirrel, and, as noted in one isolated report, the fox sparrow.|$|E
5|$|Pollinators {{have not}} been observed, and the {{flowering}} period is brief when compared with other banksias. However, the flowers appear when little else is in bloom, rendering it a valuable food source <b>for</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|E

50|$|International Society <b>for</b> <b>Animal</b> Rights, (originally {{known as}} National Catholic Society <b>for</b> <b>Animal</b> Welfare, then Society <b>for</b> <b>Animal</b> Rights), was {{chartered}} in the District of Columbia over a half-century ago, in 1959, making the organization {{one of the}} oldest animal protection organizations in the United States.

5|$|Although it is toxic {{in large}} doses, {{selenium}} {{is an essential}} micronutrient <b>for</b> <b>animals.</b> In plants, it occurs as a bystander mineral, sometimes in toxic proportions in forage (some plants may accumulate selenium as a defense against being eaten by animals, but other plants, such as locoweed, require selenium, and their growth indicates the presence of selenium in soil). See more on plant nutrition below.|$|E
5|$|Both {{plant and}} animal life endemic to snow-bound areas develop ways to adapt. Among the {{adaptive}} mechanisms for plants are dormancy, seasonal dieback, survival of seeds; and <b>for</b> <b>animals</b> are hibernation, insulation, anti-freeze chemistry, storing food, drawing on reserves from within the body, and clustering for mutual heat.|$|E
5|$|Cacti {{have many}} other uses. They {{are used for}} human food and as fodder <b>for</b> <b>animals,</b> usually after burning off their spines. In {{addition}} to their use as psychoactive agents, some cacti are employed in herbal medicine. The practice of using various species of Opuntia in this way has spread from the Americas, where they naturally occur, to other regions where they grow, such as India.|$|E

5|$|Experiments into behavior, to {{understand}} how organisms detect and {{interact with each other}} and their environment, in which fruit flies, worms, mice, and rats are all widely used. Studies of brain function, such as memory and social behavior, often use rats and birds. For some species, behavioral research is combined with enrichment strategies <b>for</b> <b>animals</b> in captivity because it allows them to engage in a wider range of activities.|$|E
5|$|Gaze following, or shared gaze, can {{be found}} in a number of primates. Domesticated animals such as dogs and horses also {{demonstrate}} shared gaze. This type of joint attention is important <b>for</b> <b>animals</b> because gaze shifts serve as indicators alerting the animal to the location of predators, mates, or food.|$|E
5|$|In this period, one of {{the major}} {{incentives}} for the growth of Transylvanian towns was the trade with Wallachia and Moldavia. For instance, Braşov was granted a staple right in 1369 with respect to the trade in cloth from Poland or Germany. Thereafter, foreign merchants had to sell their most sought-after merchandise, broadcloth to the tradesmen of Braşov who resold it in Wallachia in exchange <b>for</b> <b>animals,</b> cotton, wax and honey.|$|E

5|$|Since {{opening in}} 1962, the zoo {{has focused on}} animal {{conservation}} efforts. Programs at the Phoenix Zoo include captive breeding for reintroduction (for instance the Arabian oryx, black-footed ferret, Mexican wolf, Ramsey Canyon leopard frog, and thick-billed parrot, sanctuary <b>for</b> <b>animals</b> that are no longer breeding (for instance the African painted dogs at the zoo), and rescue and rehabilitation (for instance lead poisoning treatments for the California condor).|$|E

5|$|The British {{government}} has {{required that the}} cost to animals in an experiment be weighed against the gain in knowledge. Some medical schools and agencies in China, Japan, and South Korea have built cenotaphs for killed animals. In Japan there are also annual memorial services (Ireisai 慰霊祭) <b>for</b> <b>animals</b> sacrificed at medical school.|$|E
5|$|The breed is {{generally}} healthy {{with an average}} life span of 12 to 15 years. Hip dysplasia, a genetic malformation of the hip joint, may be a concern {{but because of the}} breed's compact nature is not often seriously debilitating. Surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation <b>For</b> <b>Animals</b> showed that 41.5% of Sussex Spaniels were affected by hip dysplasia, and the breed was ranked 9th worst affected out of 157 breeds.|$|E
5|$|The bunkers were {{abandoned}} following {{the collapse of}} communism in 1990.

5|$|The {{practice}} of hare coursing has only recently, in historical terms, been debated in Parliament, although Parliament created an exemption in 1921 from the cruelty legislation, the Protection of Animals Act 1911, <b>for</b> <b>animals</b> released for coursing. Eric Heffer, MP for Liverpool Walton, {{was a major}} opponent of coursing in the late 1960s, and Prime Minister Harold Wilson joined in the criticism.|$|E
5|$|The zoo {{has been}} {{conservation}} minded from its inception. Soon after it opened it hosted what {{was thought to}} be the last few Arabian oryx, which formed the basis of the world herd created for Operation Oryx and eventually allowed the reintroduction of the species into the wild. It now includes a sanctuary to care <b>for</b> <b>animals</b> that are endangered or unwanted.|$|E
5|$|A natural bobtail can {{be found}} in some members of the breed, which is not a {{mutation}} of the T-box gene, and so is allowed under conformation show rules. Health-related research on the breed has been limited, with no major studies conducted in Britain. However, it has been included in studies outside the UK, including by the Orthopedic Foundation <b>for</b> <b>Animals</b> (OFA) in the United States. The King Charles Spaniel has a number of eye and respiratory system disorders common to brachycephalic dogs, and endocrine and metabolic diseases common to small breeds, as well as specific breed-associated health conditions. The average lifespan is 10 to 12 years, and the breed should be able to reproduce naturally.|$|E
