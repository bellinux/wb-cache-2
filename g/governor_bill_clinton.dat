25|$|During the 1992 election, Bush and Quayle were {{challenged}} in their bid for reelection by the Democratic ticket of Arkansas <b>Governor</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> and Tennessee Senator Al Gore, {{as well as}} the independent ticket of Texas businessman Ross Perot and retired Admiral James Stockdale.|$|E
25|$|Following Bush's victory, Atwater {{focused on}} {{organizing}} {{a public relations}} campaign against Arkansas <b>Governor</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton.</b> Atwater viewed Clinton as a serious potential threat to Bush in the 1992 presidential election. At the time of Atwater's illness, he was supporting the bid of Representative Tommy Robinson for the Republican gubernatorial nomination to oppose Clinton in the fall. Robinson lost the primary to former Arkla Gas CEO Sheffield Nelson.|$|E

25|$|Brown {{declined}} {{to run for}} a third term in 1982, and chose instead {{to run for the}} United States Senate in 1982. However, Brown was defeated by Republican Pete Wilson, and many considered his political career to be over. After traveling abroad, Brown returned to California and served as Chairman of the California Democratic Party (1989-1991), choosing to resign to run for the Senate again in 1992. Changing his mind, Brown ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 1992, once again finishing second in the popular vote, carrying six states and coming second in the convention, though substantially behind <b>Governor</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> of Arkansas.|$|E
25|$|Harkin ran for President in 1992 as {{a populist}} with labor union support. He criticized George H. W. Bush for {{being out of}} touch with working-class Americans. Harkin was an early {{favorite}} in a small field of five candidates. Harkin won the Iowa caucus and those in Idaho and Minnesota (with help from Senator Paul Wellstone), but he ran poorly in New Hampshire and other primaries and ultimately lost the Democratic Party nomination to <b>Governor</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> of Arkansas. Harkin was the first Democratic primary contender to drop out and throw his support behind Clinton — a favor that led to a close relationship throughout the Clinton presidency.|$|E
25|$|One opinion piece {{attributed}} {{the political and}} cultural changes, along with the easing of racial tensions, as the reason why southern voters began to vote for Republican national candidates, in line with their political ideology. Since then, white Southern voters have voted for Republican candidates in every presidential election except in the 1976 election when Georgia native Jimmy Carter received the Democratic nomination, the 1980 election when Carter won Georgia, the 1992 election when Arkansas native and former <b>governor</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> won Georgia and Louisiana, and Arkansas, and the 1996 election when the incumbent president Clinton again won Louisiana and Arkansas. In 1995, Georgia Republican Newt Gingrich was elected by representatives of a Republican-dominated House as Speaker of the House.|$|E

50|$|Upon leaving John Brown University in 1969, Sheets {{took the}} {{position}} of full-time {{executive director of the}} Siloam Springs Chamber of Commerce, but the next year he was back in politics as the Republican nominee against the Democratic Secretary of State, Kelly Bryant of Hope in Hempstead County in south Arkansas, also known as the hometown of later <b>Governors</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> and Mike Huckabee. Sheets first defeated John Thompson of Morrilton in the Republican primary for secretary pf state, 35,954 (68 percent) to 16,881 (32 percent). In the campaign, Sheets was invited to ride on Rockefeller’s helicopter. Ultimately, he won majorities in his own Benton County and in Searcy County. Sheets lost by a single vote in Washington County, where many of the local Democrats were also political reformers hostile to Bryant. Official results showed Bryant with 360,209 (62.3 percent) to Sheets’ 216,752 (37.7 percent).|$|R
25|$|In Huckabee's first {{political}} race in 1992, he lost to incumbent Democratic senator Dale Bumpers, receiving 40 {{percent of}} the vote in the general election. In the same election, Arkansas <b>governor</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> was elected president, making lieutenant governor Jim Guy Tucker the new governor when Clinton resigned the governorship. In 1993, Republican state chairman Asa Hutchinson urged Huckabee to run in the special election for lieutenant governor held on July 27. Realizing his loss came among key conservative Democrats, Huckabee ran a decidedly conservative campaign. In the subsequent general election, he defeated Nate Coulter, who had been Bumpers's campaign manager the previous year, 51–49 percent. Huckabee became the second Republican since Reconstruction to serve as Arkansas lieutenant governor, the first having been Maurice Britt from 1967 to 1971.|$|E
25|$|U.S. Senator Tom Harkin (Iowa) ran as {{a populist}} liberal with labor union support. Former U.S. Senator Paul Tsongas (Massachusetts) {{highlighted}} his political independence and fiscal conservatism. Former California Governor Jerry Brown, {{who had run}} for the Democratic nomination in 1976 and 1980 {{while he was still}} Governor, declared a significant reform agenda, including Congressional term limits, campaign finance reform, and the adoption of a flat income tax. Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey was an attractive candidate based on his business and military background, but made several gaffes on the campaign trail. Arkansas <b>Governor</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> positioned himself as a centrist, or New Democrat. He was still relatively unknown nationally before the primary season. That quickly changed however, when a woman named Gennifer Flowers appeared in the press to reveal allegations of an affair. Clinton rebutted the story by appearing on 60 Minutes with his wife, Hillary Clinton.|$|E

2500|$|Conservative {{political}} columnist Pat Buchanan challenged Bush for the Republican nomination, {{and shocked}} political pundits by finishing second, with 37% of the vote, in the New Hampshire primary. Bush responded by adopting more conservative positions on issues, {{in an attempt}} to undermine Buchanan's base. Bush swept the primaries and claimed the 1992 Republican presidential nomination. Once he had secured the nomination, Bush faced his challenger, Democratic <b>Governor</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> of Arkansas. Clinton attacked Bush as not doing enough to assist the working middle-class and being [...] "out of touch" [...] with the common man.|$|E
2500|$|Arkansas <b>Governor</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> brought {{national}} {{attention to the}} state with a long speech at the 1988 Democratic National Convention endorsing Michael Dukakis. Some journalist suggested the speech {{was a threat to}} his ambitions, Clinton defined it [...] "a comedy of error, just one of those fluky things". Clinton won the Democratic nomination for President the following cycle. Presenting himself as a [...] "New Democrat" [...] and using incumbent George H. W. Bush's [...] against him, Clinton won the 1992 presidential election (43.0% of the vote) against Republican Bush (37.4% of the vote) and billionaire populist Ross Perot, who ran as an independent (18.9% of the vote).|$|E
2500|$|Cisneros’ {{campaign}} for mayor and subsequent election gained {{the attention of}} national media who made Cisneros {{the symbol of the}} growing Latino population in the United States.

U.S. News and World Report listed him (along with then-Arkansas <b>Governor</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton)</b> as one of “Ten Rising Stars of American Politics”, and a 60 Minutes profile introduced him to a televised national audience.|$|E

5000|$|One-term Democratic <b>Governor</b> of Arkansas <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> was {{narrowly}} {{defeated by}} Republican Frank D.

[...] He ran again {{two years later}} and regained the governorship, continuing to serve until he was elected President of the United States in 1992. Both the Democratic and Republican primaries were held on May 27.|$|R
50|$|Nichols {{was hired}} by <b>Governor</b> of Arkansas <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> in 1988 as {{marketing}} director for the Arkansas Development Finance Authority. In 1988, the Associated Press reported he placed 642 long-distance calls at state expense {{on behalf of the}} Contras in Nicaragua, either to Nicaragua or to U.S. politicians backing them. At first, Nichols claimed the calls were related to the finance authority. However, when that story did not hold up, Clinton fired him.|$|R
2500|$|Then Arkansas <b>Governor</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> proclaimed March 26, 1983 [...] "Economic Dignity Day" [...] in {{the state}} of Arkansas. In doing so he stated the following: Whereas, through the {{leadership}} and efforts of Warith Deen Muhammad, the American Muslim Mission is on the path of economic progress and achieving growth through unity...(I) urge all citizens to engage in activities which promote economic progress. On July 4, 1983 Muhammad shared the Reviewing Stand for the 1984 New World Patriotism Day Parade in Chicago with then State Senator, Emarald Jones, State Representative, Howard Brooks, parade Grand Marshal, Harold Washington the then Mayor of Chicago, Illinois, and many other dignitaries.

2500|$|On June 13, 1986, Engine 819 {{participated in}} the Arkansas State Sesquicentennial with a trip to Little Rock and was perhaps Pine Bluff's most visible {{contribution}} to the weekend events marking the state's 150th birthday. In addition to Pine Bluff's Mayor Robinson, Louis Ramsay - Chairman of the state's Sesquicentennial Commission, and Judge Earl Chadick, Sr. of Jefferson County, Hillary Clinton also rode up from Pine Bluff in the opulent VIP car named [...] "The Houston" [...] on loan from the Cotton Belt. <b>Governor</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> joined his wife and the other riders on board when the train slowed to a crawl behind Barton Coliseum, just minutes from Little Rock's Union Station.

2500|$|Arkansas <b>governor</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> was {{one such}} figure, {{who was elected}} President in 1992 as the Democratic nominee. [...] He labeled himself and governed as a [...] "New Democrat". The party adopted a centrist {{economic}} but socially progressive agenda, with the voter base after Reagan having shifted considerably to the right. In an effort to appeal to both liberals and fiscal conservatives, Democrats began to advocate {{for a balanced budget}} and market economy tempered by government intervention (mixed economy), along with a continued emphasis on social justice and affirmative action. The economic policy adopted by the Democratic Party, including the former Clinton administration, has been referred to as [...] "Third Way". The Democrats lost control of Congress in the election of 1994 to the Republican Party. Re-elected in 1996, Clinton was the first Democratic President since Franklin Roosevelt to be elected to two terms. Following twelve years of Republican rule, the Democrats regained majority control of both the House and the Senate in the 2006 elections.|$|E
500|$|Incensed, McCain ran ads accusing Bush {{of lying}} and {{comparing}} the <b>governor</b> to <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton,</b> which Bush said was [...] "about as low a blow {{as you can}} give in a Republican primary". An anonymous smear campaign began against McCain, delivered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, and audience plants. The smears claimed that McCain had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter was adopted from Bangladesh), that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, {{that he was a}} homosexual, and that he was a [...] "Manchurian Candidate" [...] who was either a traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days. The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with the attacks.|$|R
50|$|He {{frequently}} held {{sweet potato}} pie sales to fund his various political campaigns. When <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> doubled {{the license plate}} fee, McIntosh had trouble {{keeping up with the}} demand for his pies as Arkansans chose them as a form of protest against Clinton, who lost reelection in 1980 to Republican Frank D. White. That same year, McIntosh sought the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor and received about 12 {{percent of the vote in}} a seven-man race won by Winston Bryant. He also failed in a 1988 bid for the Little Rock City Board of Directors. He considered seeking the 1986 Democratic nomination for <b>governor</b> against incumbent <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> and former <b>Governor</b> Orval Faubus, but backed out at the last minute when another African-American candidate, former anti-poverty agency head W.

5000|$|In 1980, {{ten days}} after his defeat for {{re-election}} as <b>Governor</b> of Arkansas, <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> asked Wright to come to Little Rock and help organize the campaign's records and files. Bringing only her suitcase, Wright traveled to Little Rock and began formulating Clinton's political comeback. [...] She organized and ran Clinton's successful 1982 gubernatorial campaign, {{as well as his}} re-election campaigns in 1984 and 1986. [...] The New York Times credited Wright as being [...] "an architect of Clinton's rise to power in Arkansas." [...] In 1982, Wright was appointed as chief of staff to Governor Clinton. Her duties included managing public support for Clinton's controversial education reforms. Wright resigned from her position in 1989, citing exhaustion.|$|R
