25|$|Predation is a {{biological}} interaction where a predator (a <b>heterotroph</b> that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators {{may or may}} not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation almost always results in the death of the prey. The other main category of consumption is detritivory, the consumption of dead organic matter. It can at times be difficult to separate the two feeding behaviours, for example, where parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on its decaying corpse. Selective pressures imposed on one another has led to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator, resulting in various antipredator adaptations.|$|E

40|$|Although prokaryotes {{are small}} in size, {{they are a}} {{significant}} biomass component in aquatic plank-tonic ecosystems and {{play a major role}} in biogeo-chemical processes. A review of the recent litera-ture shows that the relative importance of prokaryotes to material and energy fluxes is maxi-mized in low-productivity (oligotrophic) ecosys-tems and decreases in high-productivity (eutrophic) ecosystems. We conclude that competition with eu-karyotic autotrophs for dissolved nutrients and competition with phagotrophic <b>heterotrophs</b> and physical processes (sinking, photooxidation) for or-ganic carbon (C) play important roles in determin-ing the relative abundance and impact of pro-karyotes in aquatic systems. Oligotrophic systems have low nutrient concentrations, with high pro-portions of dissolved nutrients in organic form, which favors prokaryotic <b>heterotrophs</b> over phyto-plankton. Furthermore, a high proportion of the available organic C is dissolved rather than partic-ulate, which favors prokaryotic <b>heterotrophs</b> over phagotrophic <b>heterotrophs.</b> In eutrophic systems, increased relative concentrations and loading of in-organic nutrients and increased relative concen-trations of particulate organic C select for phyto-plankton and phagotrophic <b>heterotrophs</b> over pro-karyotic <b>heterotrophs.</b> Increased particle sinking fluxes and/or decreased excretion of organic carbon (EOC) may also decrease the relative importance of prokaryotic <b>heterotrophs</b> in eutrophic systems. In oligotrophic systems, interactions between au-totrophs and <b>heterotrophs</b> are tightly coupled be-cause the dominant <b>heterotrophs</b> are similar in size and growth rates, as well as having similar nutrient composition to the dominant autotrophs, small phytoplankton. In eutrophic systems, increased productivity passes through zooplankton that are larger and have slower growth rates than the au-totrophs, leading to a greater potential for de-coupled auto- and heterotrophic production and increased export production.

40|$|Abstract Background Little {{is known}} about {{interactions}} between filamentous <b>heterotrophs</b> and filamentous cyanobacteria. Here, interactions between the filamentous heterotrophic bacteria Fibrella aestuarina (strain BUZ 2) and Fibrisoma limi (BUZ 3) with an axenic strain of the autotrophic filamentous cyanobacterium Nostoc muscorum (SAG 25. 82) were studied in mixed cultures under nutrient rich (carbon source present in medium) and poor (carbon source absent in medium) conditions. Findings F. aestuarina BUZ 2 significantly reduced the cyanobacterial population whereas F. limi BUZ 3 did not. Physical contact between <b>heterotrophs</b> and autotroph was observed and the cyanobacterial cells showed some level of damage and lysis. Therefore, either contact lysis or entrapment with production of extracellular compounds in close vicinity of host cells could be considered as potential modes of action. The supernatants from pure heterotrophic cultures {{did not have an}} effect on Nostoc cultures. However, supernatant from mixed cultures of BUZ 2 and Nostoc had a negative effect on cyanobacterial growth, indicating that the lytic compounds were only produced in the presence of Nostoc. The growth and survival of tested <b>heterotrophs</b> was enhanced by the presence of Nostoc or its metabolites, suggesting that the <b>heterotrophs</b> could utilize the autotrophs and its products as a nutrient source. However, the autotroph could withstand and out-compete the <b>heterotrophs</b> under nutrient poor conditions. Conclusions Our results suggest that the nutrients in cultivation media, which boost or reduce the number of <b>heterotrophs,</b> were the important factor influencing the outcome of the interplay between filamentous <b>heterotrophs</b> and autotrophs. For better understanding of these interactions, additional research is needed. In particular, it is necessary to elucidate the mode of action for lysis by <b>heterotrophs,</b> and the possible defense mechanisms of the autotrophs. </p...|$|R

50|$|A {{food web}} (or food cycle) {{is a natural}} {{interconnection}} of food chains and a graphical representation (usually an image) of what-eats-what in an ecological community. Another name for food web is consumer-resource system. Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called trophic levels: 1) the autotrophs, and 2) the <b>heterotrophs.</b> To maintain their bodies, grow, develop, and to reproduce, autotrophs produce organic matter from inorganic substances, including both minerals and gases such as carbon dioxide. These chemical reactions require energy, which mainly comes from the Sun and largely by photosynthesis, although a very small amount comes from hydrothermal vents and hot springs. A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere, to mixotrophs (such as carnivorous plants) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere, and complete <b>heterotrophs</b> that must feed to obtain organic matter. The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways, such as where <b>heterotrophs</b> obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other <b>heterotrophs.</b> The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange. There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory, carnivory, scavenging and parasitism.

40|$|A new {{theoretical}} {{approach is developed}} that links the allometry of energy partitioning among differently-sized organisms in ecological community to community stability. The magnitude of fluctuations of plant biomass introduced by plant-feeding <b>heterotrophs</b> is shown to grow rapidly with increasing body size. To keep these fluctuations at a low level compatible with ecosystem stability, the share of ecosystem primary productivity claimed by plant-feeding <b>heterotrophs</b> should decrease with increasing body size. In unstable environments the ecological restrictions on biotic fluctuations are lessened and net primary productivity can be distributed more evenly among differently sized organisms.

5|$|Species are broadly {{categorized}} as autotrophs (or primary producers), <b>heterotrophs</b> (or consumers), and Detritivores (or decomposers).
