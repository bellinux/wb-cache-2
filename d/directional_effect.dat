Four farms located at the municipality of Querência, state of Mato Grosso (Brazil), were selected. MODIS collection- 5 surface reflectance (MOD 09 GA and MOD 09 GQ products) and NDVI and LAI data (MOD 15 product) were used. Pairs of backscattering and forward scattering reflectance and NDVI images acquired at consecutive days were compared as function of soybean phenological stages. In order to evaluate LAI estimates, two empirical models were tested: one based on the relationships between NDVI and LAI, proposed by Knyazikhin et al.

If the loading direction coincides with the building direction, the part is more susceptible to failure, leading to a low strength of the part [24, 37, 67]. In addition, because of the epitaxial growth in the SLM process, the elongated columnar grains in the fabricated part also aggravate anisotropy of the part [28, 34].|$|E

The object’s motion appeared to depict only forces under the natural laws of physics on a slope (Experiment 1) or on a horizontal plane (Experiment 2) in virtual 3 D space. In Experiments 3 and 4, the motion appeared to be subjected to external or self-driving forces additionally influenced by internal forces on a slope (Experiment 3) or a horizontal plane (Experiment 4). The results demonstrated that the <b>directional</b> <b>effect</b> on the kappa effect was observed only in Experiment 1, and not in Experiments 2 and 3, while the kappa effect was preserved.
