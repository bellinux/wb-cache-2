50|$|Out {{of all of}} {{the grains}} {{recovered}} 89% were sorghum. 3.5% were from woody plants specifically matching samples of certain seeds legumes and nuts. 3% of the total assemblage were pear shaped starches whose closest match is the trunk of the <b>African</b> <b>wine</b> <b>palm.</b> Another starch was from the African false banana and the evidence for this starch was restricted to a grinder, a core axe, and a Levallois flake. The last starch found was 12 clusters of fused granules whose closest match is the African potato. The analysis of this data shows that the environment in the Middle Stone Age was densely wooded with a tall grass understory.|$|R
50|$|Zymomonas mobilis is a Gram negative, facultative anaerobic, non-sporulating, polarly-flagellated, {{rod-shaped}} bacterium. It is {{the only}} species found in the genus Zymomonas. It has notable bioethanol-producing capabilities, which surpass yeast in some aspects. It was originally isolated from alcoholic beverages like the <b>African</b> <b>palm</b> <b>wine,</b> the Mexican pulque, and also as a contaminant of cider and beer (cider sickness and beer spoilage) in European countries.|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{study the}} yeast {{diversity}} of Nigerian <b>palm</b> <b>wines</b> {{by comparison with}} other African strains. Methods and Results: Twenty-three Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were obtained from <b>palm</b> <b>wine</b> samples collected at four locations in eastern Nigeria, and characterized using different molecular techniques: internal transcribed spacer {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} and sequence analysis, pulsed field gel electrophoresis, inter delta typing and microsatellite multilocus analysis. These techniques revealed that <b>palm</b> <b>wine</b> yeasts represent a group of closely related strains that includes other West African isolates (CBS 400, NCYC 110, DVPG 6044). Population analysis revealed an excess of homozygote strains and an allelic richness similar to wine suggestive of local domestication. Several other African yeast strains were not connected to this group. Ghana sorghum beer strains and other African strains (DBVPG 1853 and MUCL 28071) displayed strikingly high relatedness with European bread, beer or wine strains, and the genome of strain MUCL 30909 contained African and wine-type alleles, indicating its hybrid origin. Conclusions: Nigerian <b>palm</b> <b>wine</b> yeast represents a local specific yeast flora, whereas a European origin or hybrid was suspected for several other Africa isolates. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study presents the first genetic characterization of an autochthonous <b>African</b> <b>palm</b> <b>wine</b> yeast population and confirms the idea that human intervention has favoured yeast migration...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. The market {{benefits}} and competitive advantage of integrating social responsibility initiatives {{are well known}} within the global marketing context. More recently, this movement had notably increased within the South <b>African</b> <b>wine</b> industry, where wine producers are integrating philanthropy into their overall business operations. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine whether the marketing of social responsibility initiatives, within the South <b>African</b> <b>wine</b> industry, would lead to a positive consumer attitude towards a brand and result in influencing South <b>African</b> <b>wine</b> consumers’ purchasing behaviour. The literature review was conducted to establish the effect of marketing social responsibility initiatives over consumer attitude, intention and planned behaviour. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. This study indicated that the marketing of social responsibility initiatives are recognised by South <b>African</b> <b>wine</b> consumers as a decision-making factor and do influence consumers’ attitude towards brands, when purchasing wine. Although social responsibility initiatives are regarded as a low decision-making factor, when compared to other factors, the study did indicate that South <b>African</b> <b>wine</b> consumers generally do portray positive attitude towards the South <b>African</b> <b>wine</b> industry’s social responsibility initiatives. Generally, it was found that South <b>African</b> <b>wine</b> consumers portrayed positive planned purchasing behaviour towards most of the South <b>African</b> <b>wine</b> producers’ social responsibility initiatives, with management of quality and environmental conservation initiatives receiving more positive response. Land reformation and legislative responsibility were regarded as lesser important initiatives. Given the fact that social responsibility initiatives are recognised, yet only influences a certain portion of South <b>African</b> <b>wine</b> consumers’ purchasing decisions, the study did indicate that there are opportunities for the South <b>African</b> <b>wine</b> industry to market its social responsibility initiatives. The study concludes with the educational role that the marketing of social responsibility initiatives may have on influencing wine consumers’ planned behaviour and suggests a multi-stakeholder approach towards marketing...|$|R

2500|$|The South <b>African</b> <b>wine</b> {{industry}} has been led by many powerful organisations in both {{the private sector and}} through governmental agencies. Unlike other New World wine regions, the South <b>African</b> <b>wine</b> industry is largely influenced by several large co-operatives. The Koöperatieve Wijnbouwers Vereniging van Zuid-Afrika Bpkt (KWV) was a co-operative first created through the funding and encouragement of the South African government as a force to stabilise and grow the South <b>African</b> <b>wine</b> industry. As the KWV is now a privately owned winemaking co-operative, some of its regulatory responsibilities have fallen to other organisations such as the South <b>African</b> <b>Wine</b> & Spirit Board. The Wine & Spirit Board runs the voluntary certification programme that allows South <b>African</b> <b>wines</b> to be [...] "certified" [...] for quality and accuracy in labelling. In addition to being subject to various labelling guidelines, wines are blind tasted by a panel of experts for quality, and are put through an analytic test for faults. Like the vintage and varietal labelling guidelines, these tests are voluntary, but wines that are not submitted for testing are liable for random testing for health requirements.|$|R
