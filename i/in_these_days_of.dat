500|$|The {{increasing}} {{size and}} power of the armoured cruiser led to suggestions in British naval circles that cruisers should displace battleships entirely. The battleship's main advantage was its 12-inch heavy guns, and heavier armour designed to protect from shells of similar size. However, for a few years after 1900 it seemed that those advantages were of little practical value. The torpedo now had a range of 2,000 yards, and it seemed unlikely that a battleship would engage within torpedo range. However, at ranges of more than 2,000 yards it became increasingly unlikely that the heavy guns of a battleship would score any hits, as the heavy guns relied on primitive aiming techniques. The secondary batteries of 6-inch quick-firing guns, firing more plentiful shells, were more likely to hit the enemy. As naval expert Fred T. Jane wrote in June 1902,Is there anything outside of 2,000 yards that the big gun in its hundreds of tons of medieval castle can effect, that its weight in 6-inch guns without the castle could not effect equally well? And inside 2,000, what, <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> gyros, is there that the torpedo cannot effect with far more certainty? ...|$|E
500|$|... "Objection (Tango)" [...] {{was written}} by Shakira and co-produced by the singer along with Lester Mendez. It is a {{combination}} of pop rock and tango, a style of fast-paced ballroom dance music that originated in Argentina and Uruguay. According to the sheet music of [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] published at MusicNotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, it is written in the key of B minor and has a half note metronome of 66 beats per minute. Shakira's vocal range spans from E3 to B4. The song contains instrumentation from the bandoneón, which is played at a [...] "breakneck speed," [...] and also features a [...] "twanging" [...] guitar solo. Lyrically, [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] is dramatic and humorous in approach and focuses on an angered Shakira ordering her love interest to choose between her and his other leading lady; it was said to be a feminist anthem and a [...] "hell-hath-no-fury it's-her-or-me steam train". It contains a line in which Shakira asserts to her lover that [...] "Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal/ That’s why in front of your eyes I'm invisible/ But you gotta know small things also count," [...] which a critic commented was a [...] "brave statement <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> suspiciously ripe teenybop flesh peddlers." [...] During the bridge of the song, Shakira delivers rap-like vocals and instructs her lover to end the love triangle, declaring that [...] "Tango is not for three, was never meant to be." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} most songs in Laundry Service {{are based on}} issues and themes related to love, {{as they had been}} written after Shakira began a {{relationship}} Antonio de la Rúa, the son of former Argentine president Fernando de la Rúa. [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] is an [...] "ode" [...] to the positivity one gains when pursuing a relationship with a good person. Shakira shows an [...] "important side" [...] in [...] "The One", which is a song about how [...] "you love your guy so much that you’re actually going to learn to cook" [...] and contains lines like [...] "To buy more thongs and write more happy songs, it always takes a little help from someone." [...] In [...] "Rules", she aims to make her lover realise that he is [...] "condemned" [...] to her and lists [...] "all the things your new boy can do." [...] Songs like [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] and [...] "Fool" [...] also deal with issues related to love but in a different manner. The former is dramatic and humorous in approach as Shakira commands her partner to end a love triangle and choose between her and the other lady; it was described as a [...] "hell-hath-no-fury it's-her-or-me steam train." [...] In the song, Shakira asserts that [...] "Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal/That's why in front of your eyes I'm invisible", which a reviewer commented was a [...] "brave statement <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> suspiciously ripe teenybop flesh peddlers [...]" [...] "Fool" [...] discusses how Shakira continues to try to build up a relationship with a [...] "shitty, self-absorbed man" [...] even after suffering a [...] "soul-crushing defeat." ...|$|E

2500|$|Richard Wagner {{conducted}} Norma at Riga in 1837. Following {{the common}} nineteenth-century practice of adding interpolated arias, he wrote an aria for the bass and men's chorus for this production. However, that aria has not entered the general repertoire. Wagner wrote {{at the time}} that Norma was [...] "indisputably Bellini's most successful composition". [...] "In this opera, Bellini has undoubtedly risen to the greatest heights of his talent. <b>In</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> romantic extravaganzas and the hyper-excitement of the so-called musical attractions he presents a phenomenon which can hardly be overrated. The action, free from all theatrical coups and dazzling effects, reminds one instinctively of a Greek tragedy. Perhaps the views expressed by Schiller in his 'Bride of Messina' to the effect that he had hopes for the full revival of the tragedy of the ancients upon our stage, {{in the form of the}} opera, will receive new justification in this Norma! Let anyone name me a spiritual painting of its kind, more fully carried out, than that of this wild Gaelic prophetess...Every emotional moment stands out plastically; nothing has been vaguely swept together..." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{filing for}} probate {{of the will}} of Prof. Albert H. Pattengill of the {{university}} of Michigan revealed the existence of an estate valued at $10,000.

[...] What Prof. Pattengill's estate might have been had he devoted the intellect, force, persistence and energy that he abundantly demonstrated in his career to those professions or activities whose ideal if flatly the accumulation of wealth makes interesting speculation. ... Prof. Pattengill was much more than senior professor of Greek. [...] He was a classicist and an educator of national reputation. ...
