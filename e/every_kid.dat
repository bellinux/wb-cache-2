A 2014 Secretarial Order set benchmarks to increase youth involvement, seeking to create opportunities {{for young people to}} play, learn, serve, and work in national parks. Jewell led the kickoff of the <b>Every</b> <b>Kid</b> Every Park program by leading fourth graders on a hike through Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. The <b>Every</b> <b>Kid</b> initiative made every fourth grade student, and their families, eligible for a free one-year pass to every national park. Jewell also backed a 2016 initiative to expedite permitting for youth organizations to explore public wild lands on overnight or multi-day trips, particularly in less popular parks.|$|E
