5|$|A {{practical}} {{method was}} {{considered for the}} scene in which Violet Beauregarde turns blue and swells up <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> 10-foot blueberry. A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for {{the beginnings of the}} swelling scene, before {{the decision was made to}} do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn to give the impression that her cheeks had swelled up as well. Because this decision was made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or promotional material.|$|E
5|$|Homer buys a book {{on world}} records {{published}} by Duff at a library sale. After boring everyone with world record trivia, Homer decides to break a record himself. He gathers the whole town to build the world's tallest human pyramid. After Jimbo and Kearney move their hands just before the record is claimed, the pyramid collapses <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> sphere that rolls through town, taking in Agnes Skinner, Hans Moleman, and a suicidal man about to jump from a ledge onto the street. The entire town rolls to a truck weighing station and the Duff record book officials say that Springfield is the world's fattest town, ahead of Milwaukee.|$|E

Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms. One astronomer opens his umbrella; it promptly takes root and turns <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> mushroom itself.|$|E
5|$|Miyazaki's biggest {{addition}} to {{the plot of the}} book was the use of the war as {{a large part of the}} plot. In the book, the war is only tangentially referred to; the king orders Howl to find the king's missing brother Justin, because Justin's military skills are needed for a forthcoming war. Howl's frequent disappearances are because of his womanizing habits, which makes Sophie see him as a superficial and cowardly person. In the film, however, Howl disappears from the scene in order to transform <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> bird and disrupt the battle plans of both armies.|$|E

5|$|The {{decoration}} {{of the opening}} few words of each Gospel was lavish. These pages were, in effect, turned into carpet pages. The {{decoration of}} these texts is so elaborate that the text itself is almost illegible. The opening page (folio 29r) of Matthew may stand as an example. (See illustration at left.) The page consists of only two words: Liber generationis ("The book of the generation"). The lib of Liber is turned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> monogram which dominates the entire page. The er of Liber is presented as an interlaced ornament within the b of the lib monogram. Generationis is broken into three lines and contained within an elaborate frame in the right lower quadrant of the page. The entire assemblage is contained within an elaborate border.|$|E
5|$|Back in {{the present}} time, Tisiphone and Daemon cast another {{illusion}} to deceive Kratos, who overcomes it and retrieves the Oath Stone of Orkos. He encounters the Scribe of Hecatonchires, who reveals that the Furies were originally fair in their punishment, but devolved into ruthless beings because of Ares. Continuing his pursuit of the Furies, Kratos reaches the door to Alecto's Chamber, but seemingly returns home {{to his wife and}} daughter: another illusion, this time cast by the Fury Queen Alecto. She tries to convince Kratos he can live within this illusion if he rejoins Ares, but he refuses. Enraged, Alecto and Tisiphone attack Kratos, who retrieves the eyes, and Alecto transforms <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> sea monster. After a brutal battle, Kratos uses the eyes to break through the Furies' illusions before killing them both, which destroys the prison.|$|E

5|$|The {{multiplayer}} gameplay {{itself was}} inspired by older strategy games, in particular, 1989's Herzog Zwei; in this game, the player controlled a transforming aircraft mecha that would normally fly about the field to issue orders for constructing new units, airlifting units to other areas, and directing combat, but the player could opt to transform the craft <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> robot and engage directly in combat. For Brütal Legend, Schafer kept the same concept of a split-mode RTS, but wanted more focus on the ground combat; instead of spending 90% of the time controlling units as in Zwei, the player would only spend about 30% in this fashion within Brütal Legend. This subsequently led {{to much of the}} action and combat-driven gameplay outside of the stage battles. In a 2015 interview, Schafer said that much of the gameplay outside of stage battles were to provide tutorials for the Stage Battles, and to make the game more of an action-adventure than an RTS to avoid the stigma that impacts sales of RTS games. This caused the production to expand considerably around the merger of Vivendi-Activision, and Double Fine had difficulties convincing the new publishers to fund the expanded game.|$|E
5|$|The {{secretions}} {{from the}} parasite give the Nemesis massively heightened regenerative abilities, which {{result in the}} creature being almost impervious to damage; although it can be put down with enough fire from small arms, eventually it will repair itself and resume the pursuit of its targets. However, this resulted in unexpected side effects, including damage to the skin {{and the emergence of}} additional tentacles, as well as unpredictable mutations caused by further attacks. In Resident Evil 3, the creature's survival instincts eventually override Nemesis' programming, causing the host's body to reject the parasite and transform <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> digestive organ. Featuring large central bone protrusions and elongated tentacles, it crawls looking for prey, yet continues trying to complete its mission despite its now diminished intelligence. This design proved to be the most difficult for the game's development team, as they worked {{to try to make it}} appear as unique as possible.|$|E

5|$|After a brief {{memorial}} for Qwark on the Phoenix, Ratchet goes {{to assist}} Ranger forces battling a Tyhrranoid invasion {{in the city}} of Metropolis. Unveiling his newly completed Biobliterator, Nefarious uses it to turn both Metropolis's citizens and his Tyhrranoid soldiers into robots. Making yet another escape, he orders Klunk to kill Ratchet. After besting the clone, Ratchet and Clank are reunited and vow to stop Nefarious. While searching the remains of the Leviathan, they find evidence that Qwark faked his death. A secret message hidden on board the Phoenix reveals the location of a secret hideout, where Qwark, overcome with cowardice, refuses to fight any longer. After fighting off an attack on the Phoenix, the duo intercept the Biobliterator and Clank destroys it with an ion cannon. However, Sasha informs them that a second, more advanced, Biobliterator is being prepped for launch at Nefarious's main command center on planet Mylon, Ratchet and Clank locate Nefarious and defeat him, but he activates the Biobliterator, which transforms <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant,</b> heavily armed robot. Before he can crush the two, a reinvigorated Qwark flies in to distract him, giving the duo an opening to destroy the Biobliterator. Nefarious's teleporter malfunctions, stranding him and his butler Lawrence on a distant asteroid. With Nefarious defeated, the Q-Force and their allies attend a private screening of the latest Secret Agent Clank holofilm.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of galaxies in the Universe are moving away from the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest member of the Local Group of galaxies, is heading toward it at about 120km/s. In 4billion years, Andromeda and the Milky Way will collide, causing both to deform as tidal forces distort their outer arms into vast tidal tails. If this initial disruption occurs, astronomers calculate a 12% chance that the Solar System will be pulled outward into the Milky Way's tidal tail and a 3% chance that it will become gravitationally bound to Andromeda and thus a part of that galaxy. After a further series of glancing blows, during which the likelihood of the Solar System's ejection rises to 30%, the galaxies' supermassive black holes will merge. Eventually, in roughly 6billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will complete their merger <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> elliptical galaxy. During the merger, if there is enough gas, the increased gravity will force the gas to the centre of the forming elliptical galaxy. This may lead to a short period of intensive star formation called a starburst. In addition, the infalling gas will feed the newly formed black hole, transforming it into an active galactic nucleus. The force of these interactions will likely push the Solar System into the new galaxy's outer halo, leaving it relatively unscathed by the radiation from these collisions.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{the task}} force unit, she fights the head of Tower's {{security}} forces Kutō, killing him after he uses a vial of Saya's blood to transform into an Elder Bairn hybrid. Finding Fumito in the building's basement, she also finds Kuroto with him, before succumbing to a drug given by Kuroto. Fumito and Kuroto were working together, with each killing the others' families {{to take control of}} Tower and Seventh Heaven, and Saya also learns that the Elder Bairn who tried to kill Mana was Mana's father. Fumito reveals he intends to dissolve Shrovetide with Saya's help as the ratio of humans to Elder Bairns has shifted drastically due to the Elder Bairn seemingly dying out. When Kuroto attempts to kill him for abandoning his role, Fumito stabs him with a phial of Saya's blood, transforming Kuroto into an Elder Bairn seed. As Saya recovers from the drug, Fumito fuses with the seed, which hatches <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> Elder Bairn which Saya slays. A weakened Fumito reveals that he transformed himself into an Elder Bairn hybrid to become closer to Saya and free her from her oath not to feed on humans. Accepting that he has lost their wager, he impales himself on Saya's sword. Saddened at being left alone again, Saya does not return to SIRRUT, instead opting to disappear. In the aftermath, Yūka becomes Tokyo's governor and repeals the Youth Ordinance Bill, the members of SIRRUT return to a normal life, and Mana begins searching for Saya.|$|E
