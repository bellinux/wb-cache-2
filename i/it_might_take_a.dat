Much of the criticism was in response to the Cowboys selecting Notre Dame offensive guard Zack Martin over the perceived Cowboys savior (Texas A QB Johnny Manziel) {{in the first round of}} the NFL draft. Even Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was uncharacteristically down playing expectations for the upcoming season during spring training, emphasizing to the media and fans, that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> little more time for the Cowboys young players to mature into a NFL championship caliber team.|$|E

40|$|Autophagy is an {{important}} cellular catabolic process conserved from yeast to man. Double-membrane vesicles deliver their cargo to the lysosome for degradation. Hence, autophagy {{is one of the}} key mechanisms mammalian cells deploy to rid themselves of intracellular pathogens including viruses. However, autophagy serves many more functions during viral infection. First, it regulates the immune response through selective degradation of immune components, thus preventing possibly harmful overactivation and inflammation. Additionally, it delivers virus-derived antigens to antigen-loading compartments for presentation to T lymphocytes. Second, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> active part in the viral life cycle by, eg, facilitating its release from cells. Lastly, in the constant arms race between host and virus, autophagy is often hijacked by viruses and manipulated to their own advantage. In this review, we will highlight key steps during viral infection in which autophagy plays a role. We have selected some exemplary viruses and will describe the molecular mechanisms behind their intricate relationship with the autophagic machinery, a result of hostâ€“pathogen coevolution...|$|R

5000|$|The {{writer of}} a novelization is {{supposed}} to multiply the 20,000-25,000 words of a screenplay into at least 60,000 words. Writers usually achieve that by adding description or introspection. Ambitious writers are moreover driven to work on transitions and characters just to accomplish [...] "a more prose-worthy format". Sometimes the [...] "novelizer" [...] moreover invents new scenes {{in order to give}} the plot [...] "added dimension", provided he is allowed to do that. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> insider to tell whether a novelization diverges instead unintentionally from the finally released film because it is based on an earlier version which possibly included meanwhile deleted scenes. Thus the novelization occasionally already presents material which will later on appear in a Director's Cut. In spite of all restrictions the writers select different approaches to enrich a screenplay. Dewey Gram's Gladiator for example included historial background information. Shaun Hutson refused to write a novelization of Snakes on a Plane because he found the source material too [...] "poor". Still Christa Faust accepted and filled the pages by inventing detailed biographies for some of the early killed passengers. She was then praised for having presented [...] "full three dimensional characters".|$|R

Hundreds of little bubbles rose {{to the surface of the}} water, much as one sees them rising in springs. These bubbles are often met with in lakes and other comparatively shallow waters, but they are rarely seen in those of the ocean. The mate understood, at a glance, that those he now beheld were produced by the air which escaped from the hold of the wreck; in small quantities at a time, it was true, but by a constant and increasing process. The great pressure of the water forced this air through crevices so minute that, under ordinary circumstances, they would have proved impenetrable to this, as they were still to the other fluid, though they now permitted the passage of the former. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> long time to force the air from the interior of the vessel by such means, but the result was as certain as it might be slow.
