5|$|The {{following}} year, {{bilateral relations}} between Thailand and Cambodia became strained due to overlapping claims {{on the land}} area surrounding Preah Vihear Temple. Sihanouk issued a communique in July 2008 emphasizing the Khmer architecture of the temple as well as ICJ's 1962 ruling of the temple in favour of Cambodia. In August 2009 Sihanouk stated that he would stop posting messages on his personal website as he was <b>getting</b> <b>old,</b> {{making it difficult for}} him to keep up with his personal duties. Between 2009 and 2011, Sihanouk {{spent most of his time}} in Beijing for medical care. He made a final public appearance in Phnom Penh on his 89th birthday and 20th anniversary of the Paris Peace Accords on 30October 2011. Thereafter, Sihanouk expressed his intent to stay in Cambodia indefinitely, but returned to Beijing in January 2012 for further medical treatment at the advice of his Chinese doctors.|$|E

25|$|It closed after 12 {{years on}} 15 January 2005, {{reportedly}} to enable its artists {{to move on}} to fresh creative pursuits. However, many thought other reasons were that the shows were getting stale, the drag queens were <b>getting</b> <b>old</b> (Kumar was 36) with no fresh blood to carry the torch and the existing ones not having what it took, and the club's poor location. It spawned a spoof version called the Bang Bang Room at Changi Village which held late night performances every weekend.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, it was {{becoming}} increasingly clear that the ship's technical systems were <b>getting</b> <b>old,</b> and mechanical faults were multiplying. In October 2003, a fire {{broke out in the}} auxiliary switchboard while the ship was off the Chatham Islands. The ship was saved through quick action from 2 ratings, one of who received the New Zealand Order of Merit for his actions in the smoke-filled switchboard room, but it was considered that major damage or even ship loss had been only barely avoided. The repairs cost NZ$1 million, and the incident, confirmed the ships life had already been dangerously overextended due to delays on orders for replacement ships with newer multi-role vessels and possibly the forlorn hope that the 8 year Type 23 RN frigate Grafton, might have been approved as a replacement, it was instead sold to Chile.|$|E
25|$|In retirement, Brabham {{continued}} {{to be involved in}} motorsport events, appearing at contemporary and historic motorsport events around the world where he often drove his former Cooper and Brabham cars until the early 2000s. In 1999, after competing at the Goodwood Revival at the age of 73 he commented that driving stopped him <b>getting</b> <b>old.</b> Despite a large accident at the 2000 Revival, the first racing accident to put him in hospital overnight, he {{continued to}} drive until at least 2004. By the late 2000s, ill-health was preventing him from driving in competition. In addition to the deafness caused by years of motor racing without adequate ear protection, his eyesight was reduced due to macular degeneration and he had kidney disease for which by 2009 he was receiving dialysis three times a week. Nonetheless, that year he attended a celebration of the 50th anniversary of his first world championship at the Phillip Island Classic festival of motorsport, and in 2010 flew to Bahrain with most of the other Formula One world Drivers' Champions for a celebration of 60 years of the Formula One world championship. Brabham was the oldest surviving F1 champion.|$|E

500|$|At {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by film director George Lucas, Lewis Hamilton expressed gratitude to his {{team and the}} fans at the venue. Felipe Massa, asked about his last lap fight with teammate Bottas, stated: [...] "I’m <b>getting</b> <b>old</b> for that! I even said to the team I’m <b>getting</b> <b>old!</b> The last three laps of the race I was fighting with my team-mate. It was very difficult but we managed to be here." [...] During the post-race press conference, Hamilton expressed surprise over his championship lead, since {{he had not been}} made aware of Rosberg's retirement at that point. When asked about the tyre pressure issue, Sebastian Vettel defended Hamilton, saying: [...] "I think it’s not fair to hand that question to Lewis because he doesn’t know what’s going on [...] In a lot of respect and fairness he {{did a very good job}} today and you have to accept that." ...|$|E
500|$|... "You're Getting Old" [...] was {{the final}} episode of the spring run, which {{contained}} the first seven episodes of South Park fifteenth season. The first element of the episode's plot line to be crafted was Stan's tenth birthday and his feeling of <b>getting</b> <b>old,</b> as a reference to Parker and Stone's own aging (at {{the time of the}} episode's broadcast, Stone had just turned 40 and Parker was 41). They decided to make a two-part episode, with the second half airing {{at the beginning of the}} fall run, set to begin in October 2011. Parker and Stone did not write the second part until they reconvened in the fall.|$|E
500|$|Mind Meld was {{produced}} {{as a way}} of advertising Shatner's personal website, williamshatner.com, which offered features including the Shatner and Friends fan club's quarterly newsletter, semi-regular updates on Shatner's life, and a photograph of Shatner with the gorilla Koko. Shatner said that another reason they decided to make the film was because Nimoy was visibly <b>getting</b> <b>old.</b> Shatner asked Nimoy if {{he would be willing to}} discuss his experiences with alcoholism in the film, and Nimoy agreed. Nimoy later said that no one had ever asked him about this part of his past, and that discussing it in Mind Meld [...] "was an opportunity to put out some information that might be helpful to some people." ...|$|E

500|$|Gordon {{had been}} {{considering}} {{a man that}} turned invisible {{in the political and}} metaphorical sense for a while, but he still needed a way for physical invisibility. The eventual concept came after the writer spoke with his ophthalmologist brother, who told about blind spots regarding malfunctioning retinal spots or optic nerves, which do not impair humans due to a brain compensation. Gordon noted, [...] "these stories come from scientific research... So I said, what if someone could actually create a field of vision where none actually exists?" [...] Gordon decided to use a Vietnam War veteran given [...] "they are <b>getting</b> <b>old,</b> and like the Holocaust survivor of 'Kaddish', starting to die", and the opportunity would allow a larger role for Skinner. General MacDougal was named after the show's editor, Heather MacDougall.|$|E
500|$|The show {{received}} a negative reception from most media publications. Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore lamented that Crystal [...] "seemed incredibly listless." [...] He also questioned {{the purpose of}} the [...] "Year of the Woman" [...] theme writing, [...] "The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme." [...] Robert Bianco from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette derided Allen's musical production numbers, comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989. Columnist Matt Roush of USA Today complained, [...] "Crystal, in a by-now-familiar performance, has, in four years, taken a plum assignment and, by repetition, reduced it to shtick." [...] He also wrote that, [...] "The song medley is <b>getting</b> <b>old</b> hat," [...] and the [...] "smug references to his flop Mr. Saturday Night were out of an improv amateur night." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Hale of the New York Times was {{critical}} of the episode, discussing the show's [...] "increasingly rapid march toward Hallmark country." [...] He commented that while [...] "Acafellas" [...] did not match the standard of the pilot episode, it was funnier than [...] "Showmance", and praised the return of Stephen Tobolowsky as Sandy Ryerson. Hale called Groban's cameo the [...] "most fun of all" [...] in the episode, but overall noted that: [...] "The humor can’t {{make up for the}} lack of big production numbers [...] The problem for this show {{is always going to be}} how to fill the gaps between songs. A lot of the current plot lines, like Will and his wife's phantom baby, are already <b>getting</b> <b>old,</b> so it would behoove the producers to keep those gaps as short as possible." [...] Rachel Ray, reviewing the episode for The Independent deemed Glee [...] "overhyped [...] uninspired, confusing and with a simple plot to boot." [...] Ray wrote, Glee [...] "upbeat message" [...] was [...] "overridden by the show's attempt to be darker than the run-of-the mill high school drama." [...] As with Hale, Ray commented that: [...] "Music should be the redeeming feature of Glee but it's not, because the viewer never gets a satisfying taste of the cast members' musical talents". Shawna Malcom criticized Terri and Will's characterization in the episode, deeming Terri [...] "beyond annoying", but wrote: [...] "I have confidence that creator Ryan Murphy will flesh out Jessalyn Gilsig’s character over time. Her seemingly sincere apology to Will for not being more supportive of his boy band was a nice first step." [...] Of Will, Malcom posed the question: [...] "didn’t it feel as though his commitment to the glee club melted away rather quickly? [...] How could he turn his back so easily?" [...] More positively, Malcom called Kurt's coming out scene [...] "lovely". She wrote that Groban's appearance was [...] "laugh out loud" [...] funny, while Stack commented: [...] "It was a little random, but it's all worth it for the scene when Groban was hitting on Will's mom." ...|$|E
