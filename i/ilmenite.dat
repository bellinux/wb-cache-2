5|$|Common titanium-containing {{minerals}} are anatase, brookite, <b>ilmenite,</b> perovskite, rutile, and titanite (sphene). Akaogiite is {{an extremely}} rare mineral consisting of titanium dioxide. Of these minerals, only rutile and <b>ilmenite</b> have economic importance, yet even they are difficult to find in high concentrations. About 6.0 and 0.7 million tonnes of those minerals were mined in 2011, respectively. Significant titanium-bearing <b>ilmenite</b> deposits exist in western Australia, Canada, China, India, Mozambique, New Zealand, Norway, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Ukraine. About 186,000 tonnes of titanium metal sponge were produced in 2011, mostly in China (60,000 t), Japan (56,000 t), Russia (40,000 t), United States (32,000 t) and Kazakhstan (20,700 t). Total reserves of titanium are estimated to exceed 600 million tonnes.|$|E

Several major projects are underway in the mining, oil and gas sectors that are anticipated to give a significant boost to the Malagasy economy. These include such projects as <b>ilmenite</b> and zircon mining from heavy mineral sands near Tôlanaro by Rio Tinto, extraction of nickel near Moramanga and its processing near Toamasina by Sherritt International, and the development of the giant onshore heavy oil deposits at Tsimiroro and Bemolanga by Madagascar Oil.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there appears}} {{evidence}} of the complete range of mineral chemistries in the (Fe,Mg,Mn,Ti)O3 system naturally occurring on Earth, the vast bulk of <b>ilmenites</b> are restricted to close to the ideal [...] composition, with minor mole percentages of Mn and Mg. A key exception is in the <b>ilmenites</b> of kimberlites where the mineral usually contains major amounts of geikielite molecules, and in some highly differentiated felsic rocks <b>ilmenites</b> may contain significant amounts of pyrophanite molecules.|$|R
40|$|Carbonate-rich, SiO_ 2 -poor residua are {{developed}} in some kimberlites solidifying as ocelli, layers, or discrete dikes which satisfy petrographic definitions of carbonatite. Arguments that these rocks have mineralogies, antecedents, and comagmatic rocks differing {{from those of}} the carbonatites in alkaline rock complexes, including the specific observation that kimberlites and carbonatites contain <b>ilmenites</b> and spinels of different composition, have been used to refute the “alleged kimberlite-carbonatite relationship”. New microprobe analyses of <b>ilmenites</b> and spinels from carbonate-rich rocks associated with kimberlites in three South African localities correspond to spinels and <b>ilmenites</b> of carbonatites from alkalic complexes, or have characteristics intermediate between those of carbonatites and kimberlites. The <b>ilmenites</b> are distinguished from kimberlite <b>ilmenites</b> by higher MnO, FeTiO_ 3, and Nb_ 2 O_ 5, and by negligible Cr_ 2 O_ 3. The spinels are distinguished from kimberlite spinels by their Al_ 2 O_ 3 and Cr_ 2 O_ 3 contents. There is clearly a genetic relationship between the kimberlites and the carbonate-rich rocks, despite the observation that their <b>ilmenites</b> and spinels are distinctly different, which indicates that the same observation is not a valid argument against a petrogenetic relationship between kimberlites and carbonatites. These rocks are among the diverse products from mantle processes influenced by CO_ 2, and we believe that the petrogenetic links among them are forged in the upper mantle. We see insufficient justification to deny the name “carbonatite” to carbonate-rich rocks associated with kimberlites if they satisfy the petrographic definition in terms of major mineralogy...|$|R

30|$|The Nagar Parkar igneous complex {{comprises}} the Late Proterozoic granites, rhyolites, acidic and basic dykes (Ahmad and Chaudhry 2008; Laghari et al. 2013). These rocks were uplifted and exposed by the Nagar Parker Fault in the Early Jurassic. The highlands {{formed by the}} rocks of the Proterozoic Aravalli and Delhi Supergroups in the east expose various grades of metasedimentary rocks, granite gneisses and metabasic dikes (Ramakrishnan and Vaidyanadhan 2008). In the studied samples, presence of abraded silica overgrowth and well-rounded zircons in samples of all three formations indicate a reworked polycyclic origin of detrital grains. Chemistry of <b>ilmenites</b> in the Middle Jurassic Jhumara Formation indicates its derivation from a mixed sediment source of felsic igneous and metabasic rocks. <b>Ilmenites</b> in the Upper Jurassic Jhuran Formation and Lower Cretaceous Bhuj Formation are sourced from metabasic rocks. Metabasic rocks are absent in the Nagar Parkar igneous complex. Thus, chemistry of <b>ilmenites</b> in the sediments of the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous suggests its derivation from the east. Elemental chemistry of garnets in all three formations further reveals a metabasic source rock provenance. This shift in sediment supply possibly relates to the upliftment along the Kutch Mainland Fault in the Early Cretaceous, blocking sediment supply from north.|$|R

It is mainly basaltic andesite and rhyodacite that make up Calabozos, forming a calcalkilic suite rich with potassium. Its lavas are dotted with phenocrysts, which vary from 2 to 25percent of their mass.

40|$|The {{reported}} study {{represents an}} attempt to evaluate experimentally the compositional and textural changes {{that are likely to}} be observed in the Fe-Ti-Cr spinels of lunar igneous rocks by subsequent thermal metamorphism. The Apollo 12 igneous rock, 12018, 43, was chosen for this investigation because an earlier study of another fraction of this rock by El Goresy et al. (1971) has reported an almost continuous trend of spinel compositions between Cr-Ulvoespinel and Ti-chromite. The nature of the compositional changes in the heated spinels (and <b>ilmenites)</b> is found to be such that the changes cannot be explained by intragranular adjustments alone. In the heated sample, pyroxene grains adjacent to the high-Ti spinels show a decrease in FeO, and an increase in MgO and Al 2 O 3 at the interface. This may account for the MgO depletion and a part of the FeO enrichment in the high-Ti spinels. It is believed that the heating experiment demonstrates that thermal metamorphism of lunar basalts is likely to modify the compositions of their preexisting spinels (and <b>ilmenites)</b> ...|$|R

This sample is compared with the data of Frick et al. (1988) for soil sample 71501, recently exposed to solar winds. It is observed that the two elements differ in terms of xenon abundance, helium and neon isotopic rates, and He/Ar elemental ratios.

Plagioclase is the dominant component of the magma. Clinopyroxene+orthopyroxene+amphibole (hornblende and pargasite) or amphibole+biotite+minor amounts of pyroxene are subordinate components. Apatite, <b>ilmenite,</b> magnetite and zircon can also be found. There is evidence of magma mixing and mingling.|$|E
5|$|Titanium was {{discovered}} in 1791 by the clergyman and amateur geologist, William Gregor, as an inclusion of a mineral in Cornwall, Great Britain. Gregor recognized {{the presence of a}} new element in <b>ilmenite</b> when he found black sand by a stream and noticed the sand was attracted by a magnet. Analyzing the sand, he determined the presence of two metal oxides: iron oxide (explaining the attraction to the magnet) and 45.25% of a white metallic oxide he could not identify. Realizing that the unidentified oxide contained a metal that did not match any known element, Gregor reported his findings to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall and in the German science journal Crell's Annalen.|$|E

It is coarse-grained basalt with symplectite texture in mesostasis. It is composed mainly of pyroxene and maskelynite (An_ ∿An_). Most <b>ilmenites,</b> troitites and some Fe-Ni metals are surrounded by symplectite. One of the symplectites consists of very fine-grained Fe-rich olivine (Fa_) and silica phase in pyroxene host around troilite. However, the troilite and primary pyroxene did not react to form the symplectite. The coexisting fayalite, hedenbergitic pyroxene and silica phase suggest that they crystallized from the primary melt at a pressure lower than 1. 15 GPa, indicating formation near the lunar surface...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 400 {{globally}} distributed xenolith {{samples are}} examined {{to determine whether}} continental regions are characterized by relatively magnetic crusts lying on relatively nonmagnetic mantles. Samples of mantle peridotites and mafic granulites by Wasilewski et al. (1979) are supplemented by samples of mantle and crustal xenoliths from Asia, North America, Africa, and Antarctica. The data indicate that a magnetic crustal layer overlies a nonmagnetic mantle much {{in the same manner}} as proposed by Jarchow and Thompson (1989).

40|$|The {{petrogenesis}} of igneous and {{metamorphic rocks}} {{is a function}} of several parameters. Of these, temperature and pressure are of particular importance. Information concerning these two parameters is obtained through the use of mineral indicators. One such commonly used geothermometer/oxybarometer is that involving ilmenite/titano-magnetite. Anomalously low temperatures have been reported in cases in which the geothermometer/oxybarometer was employed. The studies suggest that low temperatures result from slow cooling rates which allows the Fe-Ti oxides to re-equilibrate. The current investigation is mainly concerned with the kinetics of the reduction of ilmenite-hematite solid solution, since this is the slower and, consequently, rate-controlling step in the re-equilibration process. The reaction rates determined for the reduction of <b>ilmenites</b> in the investigation are geologically rapid and must be considered when applying the considered geothermometer/oxybarometer...|$|R

5|$|Because it {{cannot be}} readily {{produced}} {{by reduction of}} its dioxide, titanium metal is obtained by reduction of TiCl4 with magnesium metal in the Kroll process. The complexity of this batch production in the Kroll process explains the relatively high market value of titanium, despite the Kroll process being less expensive than the Hunter process. To produce the TiCl4 required by the Kroll process, the dioxide is subjected to carbothermic reduction {{in the presence of}} chlorine. In this process, the chlorine gas is passed over a red-hot mixture of rutile or <b>ilmenite</b> in the presence of carbon. After extensive purification by fractional distillation, the TiCl4 is reduced with 800°C molten magnesium in an argon atmosphere. Titanium metal can be further purified by the van Arkel–de Boer process, which involves thermal decomposition of titanium tetraiodide.|$|E
5|$|Titanium was {{discovered}} in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791, and was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth for the Titans of Greek mythology.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of particles}} in a {{rotating magnetic field}} {{can be used as}} a basis for a new mineral separation method, where particles are separated on the basis of their relative ability Ito rotate in a rotating magnetic field. Both particle attraction and particle rotation separations may be combined in a single separation process, to offer previously impossible magnetic mineral separations, such as the separation of high-Mg <b>ilmenites</b> (picro-ilmenites) from other <b>ilmenites</b> of the same magnetic susceptibility, or to produce separations which are more precise than those currently available, such as the low-entrapment separation of magnetite or monoclinic pyrrhotite. Whereas mineral separation by particle attraction involves the use of material properties such as the number of unpaired electron spins and their relative orientations, separation by particle rotation adds the properties of magnetic anisotropy and such dynamic magnetisation processes as domain wall velocity in ordered magnetic compounds. The use of a continuously rotating magnetic field also generates eddy currents in particles, in proportion to particle electrical conductivity, which allow conductive particles to be rotated by eddy current effects, and extends the same separation process into the practical separation of small particles of non-magnetic metallic compounds. Particle rotational characteristics may be estimated using similar equipment to that used for practical rotating field mineral separations, so that these characteristics may be readily applied to practical separations. These estimations are presented in the form of a "rotation index", which relates the actual particle rotation strength to the maximum possible rotation strength indicated by particle magnetisation. Although the measurement of particle rotational characteristics by these methods is only approximate, it is accurate enough to demonstrate the presence of and estimate the magnitude of, such dynamic magnetisation processes as domain wall velocities in small particles of natural ordered magnetic compounds. Particle rotation by magnetisation is also shown as being able to cause particle rotations for which the particle rotation axis is at right angles to the field rotation axis, and which are of sufficient strength to play a part in a rotating magnetic field mineral separation process...|$|R
40|$|Some twenty {{kimberlite}} pipes outcrop {{along the}} eastern and western borders of the Kundelungu plateau. Shaba Province, Zaire. They are arranged roughly along two north-south trending alignments. The pipes probably intruded the Bangweulu Block, which stabilized around 1800 Ma. The exceptionally fresh kimberlites contain mantle-derived nodules (peridotites and eclogites), as well as megacrysts which may reach up to several cm in diameter. The most important megacrysts are garnets, <b>ilmenites,</b> clinopyroxenes, orthopyroxenes and olivines. Micas and diamonds are rarely observed. The clinopyroxenes can be subdivided in two groups: (1) a Ca-rich, low-T type, similar to the Cr-rich diopsides found in 'depleted' (granular) peridotites; and (2) subcalcic clinopyroxene comparable to the megacrysts and to the clinopyroxenes of 'fertile' (sheared) peridotites. The orthopyroxenes are less frequent and are Ca-poor enstatites (0. 07 - 0. 42 wt. % CaO) and Ti-bronzites (CaO 4. 5 wt. % CaO) and all fall in the Iherzolite field defined by Sobolev et al., 1973. The low-Ca garnets which appear in many diamond-bearing kimberlites have never been observed in Zaire, neither in the diamond-poor Kundelungu pipes nor in the diamond-rich Mbuji-Mayi pipes. The <b>ilmenites</b> define a trend close to the 'magmatic Mg-enrichment trend'. The olivine macrocrysts have Fo contents {{comparable to those of}} peridotites (Fo 90 - 93). The ultramafic nodules comprise Iherzolites, harzburgites, pyroxenites, wehrlites and dunites. The granular textures and P-T equilibrium conditions (770 - 1380 degrees C and 28 - 61 kbar) deduced from their mineral compositions, show clearly that they were derived from a mantle zone on the continental geotherm (90 - 190 km depth). The eclogite nodules, which are less frequent, contain only two mineral phases (pyrope-almandine-grossular and omphacite), and the texture and the mineral compositions {{are similar to those of}} Roberts Victor eclogites. Our findings support the conclusion of Nixon and Condliffe (1989) that low-T peridotites, eclogites and pyroxenites derived from 'depleted' lithosphere, while Cr-poor garnet, subcalcic diopside and bronzite megacrysts cristallized from fertile asthenosphere. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Pleistocene {{sedimentary}} sequences in the East Anglian {{region of}} Britain record both {{major and minor}} climatic oscillations, {{and the impact of}} isostatic and eustatic variations. Intensively studied in terms of their lithology and biostratigraphy, the sequences have been difficult to place in an absolute timeframe. Dating and correlation by magnetostratigraphy has been attempted over a num-ber of years. However, these sediments are difficult to date by palaeomagnetic means because they are poor in detrital magnetite, are subject to post-depositional deformation and diagenesis, and have unknown rates of sedimentation. Determining whether their natural remanence magnetisation (NRM) directions are reliable thus requires information on the mode and timing of remanence acquisition. Here, we apply palaeomagnetic, rock magnetic and mineralogical analyses to identify the NRM carriers in these sediments and hence their palaeomagnetic reliability. Within oxidised fluvial sediments (the Kesgrave Formation), the magnetic carriers appear to be relict magnetic minerals (fer-rian <b>ilmenites,</b> chromites, haematite and goethite), which sometimes carry a reliable primary deposi-tional remanence (DRM) but often an overprinting viscous (time-varying) remanence (VRM).
