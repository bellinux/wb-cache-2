25|$|The {{predominant}} {{language on}} Bermuda is Bermudian English. It exhibits characteristics of British, West Indian, and American English. Perhaps most <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> its closeness to acrolectal English {{compared to other}} varieties in the West Indies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Interesting</b> <b>is</b> {{the fact}} that Heilbronn sports three colours in its flag. Newly {{dedicated}} municipal flags in Baden-Württemberg only use two colours. According to State municipal laws, Heilbronn's flag was grandfathered {{as it had been}} in use prior to 1935.|$|E
50|$|Geometrically <b>interesting</b> <b>are</b> isometries and {{isometric}} immersions.|$|R

25|$|More <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> the {{understanding}} that the sums over the energies of standing waves should be formally understood as sums over the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian. This allows atomic and molecular effects, such as the van der Waals force, {{to be understood as}} a variation on the theme of the Casimir effect. Thus one considers the Hamiltonian of a system {{as a function of the}} arrangement of objects, such as atoms, in configuration space. The change in the zero-point energy as a function of changes of the configuration can be understood to result in forces acting between the objects.|$|E
25|$|This an {{opportunity}} to put people who would normally {{have no reason to}} interact with each other on one team... I want people whose power sets really build on each other so that there are specific limitations that can only become overcome by working together. Nobody's so overpowered that it gets boring and nobody's so underpowered that they have to be saved all the time. I wanted a balance visually and practically... What's also going to be <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> working out the power structure of the group. You have several people on it who are used to being either their own bosses or in a leadership position, {{and all of a sudden}} they're together.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{or not a}} {{radio source}} is {{expanding}} supersonically, it must do work against the external medium in expanding, and so it puts energy into heating and lifting the external plasma. The minimum energy stored in the lobes of a powerful radio source might be 1053 J. The lower limit on the work done on the external medium by such a source is several times this. A {{good deal of the}} current interest in radio sources focuses on the effect they must have at the centres of clusters at the present day. Equally <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> their likely effect on structure formation over cosmological time: it is thought that they may provide a feedback mechanism to slow the formation of the most massive objects.|$|E
50|$|That's Fairly <b>Interesting</b> <b>was</b> a New Zealand TV series {{showcasing}} quirky {{people and}} events.|$|R
50|$|Also <b>interesting</b> <b>are</b> {{the sights}} in the Lake Lungo and Ripasottile Natural Preserve, and the Mount Terminillo.|$|R

25|$|The {{decoration}} includes stuccoes by Francesco Ferrari (c.1725), and a Cosmatesque pavement. The main altarpiece has a Madonna with Saints Andrew and Gregory (1734) by Antonio Balestra. The second altar on {{the left}} has a Madonna on a Throne with child and four Saints and Blesseds of the Gabrielli family (1739) by Pompeo Batoni. At {{the end of the}} nave, the altar of S. Gregorio Magno has three fine reliefs {{from the end of the}} 15th century by Luigi Capponi. Also <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> the Salviati Chapel, designed by Francesco da Volterra and finished by Carlo Maderno in 1600: it includes an ancient fresco which, according to the associated tradition, spoke to St. Gregory, and a marble altar (1469) by Andrea Bregno and pupils. The chapel is used by Rome's Romanian community, which follows the Byzantine rite there.|$|E
25|$|The last ancient source {{which should}} be noted is the most {{important}} one. One is dealing with a Ge'ez inscription of the Aksumite king Ezana, who lived in the mid 4th century AD. This inscription mentions a brick-made city named Alwa. It is however assumed that this Alwa has to be located near the confluence of the Nile and the Atbara. More <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> therefore, that this Alwa is mentioned in a wider context, in particular in an apparently punitive Aksumite expedition against the warlike Noba (Historical term for Nubians), which even threatened the fringes of the Aksumite Kingdom north of Tekeze River (The Ethiopian part of the Atbara river). The inscription describes how the Aksumite expedition defeated the Tekeze Nubians and pushed westwards until they reached the confluence of the Nile and Atbara, where they plundered several Kushite towns (One of them being Alwa). Not all towns were in the hands of Kushites though. Instead, the account makes it clear that in fact, the very heartland of the Kingdom of Kush was partially occupied by the Nubians. In conclusion, the Ezana inscription proves how the Nubians controlled significant parts of modern Sudan by the mid 4th century, indicating that the Kingdom of Kush was already in an advanced state of decay.|$|E
25|$|Maternal {{sensitivity}} even in {{the first}} few months of mother–child relationships are an important factor to health in childhood, especially with obesity. A study using data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development assessed mother–child interactions and categorized them in one of two groups: sensitive or insensitive. Their child's growth (height and weight) was monitored throughout their childhood, from 24 months all the way to grade six, and body mass index was calculated. As the children grew, the percentage of overweight or obese grew too. From 24 months the overall overweight-obese percentage was 15.58% and by grade six, 34.34% of the children were classified as overweight or obese. More <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> the difference between the maternal sensitive group and the maternal insensitive group. The children with the sensitive mothers started out with an overweight-obese percentage of 14.96% (24 months) and ended the research with 29.54% (grade six). The children classified with insensitive mothers had an overweight-obese percentage of 16.16% at 24 months and 39.28% at grade six. This shows a significant correlation between the mother's sensitivity and the child's risk for overweight-obesity during their elementary years. This is very important for obesity prevention programs for children.|$|E

25|$|Cruyff is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} typical kind of ‘artist-footballer’ or ‘footballer-thinker’ who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called ‘the Spinoza of football’ by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which {{has the power to}} put a smile on the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that there is more to it than winning. In a 2009 interview with Sportmails Martin Samuel, Arsène Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value, “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art. When you read some books they are fantastic, the writer touches something in you that you know you would not have brought out of yourself. He makes you discover something interesting in your life. If you are living like an animal, {{what is the point of}} living? What makes daily life <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> that we try to transform it to something that is close to art. And football is like that. When I watch Barcelona, it is art.” , the author of Cruyff's French biography, called him ‘the greatest actor in the history of football’ because Cruyff was a glorious exception (possibly the only one ever) being the man who ‘played’ outstandingly well multiple roles in the world of football: player, manager, and thinker.|$|E
500|$|The fashion was {{extremely}} {{important in this}} video because everything was so minimal ... With the choreography, we really focused on hitting all of the accents in the drum beat.

500|$|... "The thing is, I always saw Madonna as a {{performance}} artist. And I think what I wanted to portray was the process {{about how a}} performer arrives at their work. And the thing is, what she had talked about as well, is that before a concert, what she finds very <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> the rehearsals and the straining and maybe {{she would like to}} injure. [...] And she said that the process of making the concert became more intriguing than the final result." ...|$|E

The director described {{the scale of}} the film, [...] "My producers don't like me saying it, but it's really a big-budget experimental film about the many different lives one person can live, depending on the choices he makes. It's about the infinite possibilities facing any person. There are no good or bad choices in life. It's simply that each choice will create another life for you. What's <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> to be alive." ...|$|E
500|$|QI (short for Quite <b>Interesting)</b> <b>is</b> a BBC comedy panel game {{television}} show {{that began in}} 2003. It was created by John Lloyd, and was hosted by Stephen Fry {{until the end of}} Series 13 [...] after which Sandi Toksvig took over, and features permanent panellist Alan Davies. Each series covers topics that begin with a different letter of the alphabet; for example, the first series covered topics whose word began with [...] "A".

Depression permeated many of the songs that Harrison wrote during this period, an issue that was not helped by his continued heavy drinking and cocaine use. While viewing this mindset {{as an extension of}} the artist's [...] "unholy coping mechanisms" [...] over 1973–74, author Robert Rodriguez writes: [...] "What's <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> how he chose to address what he'd been grappling with, musically.

500|$|Krumwiede is {{an ardent}} {{conspiracy}} theorist who, according to Law, {{is the so-called}} index patient for [...] "what becomes a parallel epidemic of fear and panic". [...] "We definitely wanted {{him to have a}} messianic streak", said Soderbergh, whom Law talked to during the character's creating process. The two men discussed the appearances and the behaviors of a typical anti-government conspiracy theorist. Producer Gregory Jacobs commented that [...] "what's <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> that you're not really sure about him. Is the government really hiding something and does the herbal remedy he's talking about really work? I think we all suspect {{at one time or another}} that we're not getting the whole truth, and in that sense Krumwiede represents the audience's point of view." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Nik Korda noted how helpful {{it was to}} have Sean Gunn and Krystian Godlewski portray Rocket and Groot on set, as it {{provided}} references for lighting and on-set performances to the animators. When creating Groot, MPC realized early on that his eyes would be essential in maintaining the character's human qualities, as his face couldn't move in the way that humans' do. MPC visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi explained that, [...] "When you look at humans what makes the eyes <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> the imperfections – trying to make these two irises not aimed at the same place – trying to make them strange and look more human." [...] Textures for Groot came from a number of sources, including inspiration from a botanical garden in London, and the character was modeled as individual branches, rigged individually, to simulate a muscle system for the character.|$|E
500|$|Camouflage {{researcher}} Roy Behrens cites {{and discusses}} Adaptive Coloration frequently in his writings. For example, in his Camoupedia blog, {{related to the}} book of the same name, he writes of Cott's drawings of the hind limbs of the Common frog: [...] "Reproduced above {{is one of my favorite}} drawings from what is one of my favorite books." [...] He continues [...] "What makes these drawings (and the book itself) even more <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> that Cott (1900-1987) was not just a zoologist—he was a highly skilled scientific illustrator (these are his own pen-and-ink drawings), a wildlife photographer, and a prominent British camoufleur in World War II." [...] Still in 2011, Behrens can write of Cott's way of thinking, citing his words as models of clear and accurate explanation of the mechanisms of camouflage: [...] "As he so aptly explained it, disruptive patterns work 'by the optical destruction of what is present', while continuous patterns work 'by the optical construction of what is not present.'" ...|$|E
