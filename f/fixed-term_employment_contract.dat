5000|$|At {{the start}} of his second term as prime {{minister}} in 2012, Fico introduced a new [...] "Labour Code", which granted entitlement to a lay-off notice period as well as severance pay, reduced overtime, making layoffs more expensive for employers, shorter temporary work contracts and more power for trade unions. In addition, it curbed the ‘chaining’ of fixed-term employment contracts, whereby currently it is possible to extend a <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> three times over three years. The Code was revised in 2014 when it introduced severe restrictions of the work on agreement performed outside regular employment. Under the latest revision, employers will be able to conclude agreements with employees for 12 months only.|$|E
40|$|With {{reform of}} the legal {{framework}} related to fixed-term employment contracts fast approaching, I examine in concrete terms problems of creating such laws {{from the perspective of}} avoiding excessive regulation of fixed-term employment contracts. My analysis is based on a report created by the <b>Fixed-term</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Contract</b> Study Group organized by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and I consider the fact that demand for workers with a <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> is mainly medium- and long-term, not temporary and special. The general principle of permanent employment contracts is asserted when strictly regulating the use of fixed-term employment contracts. However this is not a general principle embodied in the actual employment contract but is a policy preference from the perspective of stable employment. The general principle of permanent employment contracts would dramatically restrict the use of employees with a <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> in current employment practices in Japan and force these changes. However, legal restrictions on fixed-term employment contracts cannot be considered an appropriate legal policy since they do not take into consideration how companies will meet their medium- and long-term demand for labor. Assuming that employees with fixed-term employment contracts—for which there is a medium- and long-term demand—continue to be permitted, the current legal issue becomes providing an appropriate scope of protection. In particular, the law should clearly state the possibility of renewing fixed-term employment contracts when concluding or renewing the contract and demand that the reason for terminating employment in the case the contract is not renewed be objectively justifiable and socially appropriate. ...|$|E

Rapidly {{changing}} economic factors, such as growing competition, {{forcing the}} employer to decrease production and delivery costs, and social factors, including rapid development of technology or changing consumer needs, growing service sector and other objectives of social character conditioned establishment and higher popularity of {{certain type of}} flexible work organisation and labour relations. It requires changes in the labour market with regard to growing demand for more flexible forms of work organisation. New forms of flexible work organisation take place {{and at the same}} time change regulation of available forms of flexible work organisation. One of the most widely spread forms of flexible work organisation in the member states of the European Union is the <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract.</b> Aim of the <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> is to assure modern work organisation and flexibility. The main element of the contract is temporary nature of work, which is considered as the prerequisite, when drafting such a contract. In order to protect employee‘s as economically weaker party’s interests within labour relations, Labour Code of the Republic of Lithuania sets regulations and prohibitions to prolong, update or renew fixed-term employment contracts. The main difference between <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> and permanent full-time employment contract is that, in case of <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract,</b> the employer and employee agree on the end date of the employment contract. <b>Fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> is such a contract that is drafted for a certain period of time or for execution of temporary works. With reference to the legal practice of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Lithuania, temporary nature of work cannot be assessed according to employee‘s or employer‘s subjective needs, that is, the contract has to be drafted only in case of objective reasons, serving as the ground for occurrence of temporary nature of work. One of such examples is when one female employee goes on the maternity leave and another employee has to take her place for fixed period of time. This example shows that essence of the <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> is temporary nature of work and agreement between the employee and the employer regarding the end date of the contract. Thus this contract serves as legalisation of temporary labour relations, drafting, execution and termination of which is regulated by Articles 109 - 111 of the Labour Code of the Republic of Lithuania (hereinafter – the LC RL). Though, on 14 September 2016, Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania adopted a new Labour Code, which is going to take effect on 1 January 2017. The new Labour Code ensures more flexible legal organisation of work and labour relations, if to be compared with current Labour Code. Drafting, execution and termination of fixed-term employment contracts is regulated by different articles of the new Labour Code, that is, by Articles 67 - 71. This paper analyse forms of flexible work organisation: <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> in Lithuania and other selected member states of the European Union (France, Germany, and United Kingdom). Trends of forms of flexible work organisation available in the European Union are reviewed. Attention is drawn at the aims provided by the European Union Directive 1999 / 70 /EC Regarding Fixed-Term Employment Contracts and three instruments intended to prevent misuse of fixed-term employment contracts in member states of the European Union, that is, at objective reasons for updating of such contracts or relations, including maximum net duration of fixed-term employment contracts in a row and the number of updates of such contracts or relations. Member states of the European Union can select one or several such instruments; also every country may set additional equivalent instruments that would prevent misuse of fixed-term employment contracts. The paper also reviews topics of drafting, execution and termination of the <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> with regard to assurance of balance between safety of labour relations and flexibility, and analyses assurance of the principle of non-discrimination, when drafting fixed-term employment contracts in the available Labour Code, in comparison to the new Labour Code, adopted on 14 September 2017. Attention is drawn at the legal practice of the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereinafter – the CJEU) and legal practice of national courts, when interpreting concepts of fixed-term employment contracts, as provided in the European Union Directive 1999 / 70 /EC Regarding Fixed-Term Employment Contracts, that is, what is considered as objective reasons or equivalent instruments. The first part of Master Thesis assesses forms and types of flexible work organisation available in the European Union and flexibility trends of fixed-term employment contracts, including the purpose and the main element of the <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract.</b> The second part of Master Thesis assesses regulation of fixed-term employment contracts on the level of the European Union, to be more precise, the European Union Directive 1999 / 70 /EC Regarding Fixed-Term Employment Contracts is analysed together with the main envisaged aims and instruments, preventing misuse of fixed-term employment contracts, including application of the principle of non-discrimination. Regulation of labour relations in selected member states of the European Union, such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom, including transfer of the European Union Directive 1999 / 70 /EC Regarding Fixed-Term Employment Contracts into the national law of these countries, is pointed out. The second part also analyses legal practice of the Court of Justice of the European Union, which interprets provisions and concepts set by the European Union Directive 1999 / 70 /EC Regarding Fixed-Term Employment Contracts, for instance, what is considered as objective reasons to draw a <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract,</b> interpretation of the principle of non-discrimination. The third part of the paper analyses regulation of the <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> within Lithuanian legislation. Provisions of available and the new Labour Code are reviewed. Purpose and the main elements of this contract, temporary nature of work, which in legal practice of Lithuanian courts is defined as essential one, cannot be assessed according to subjective needs. Provisions of the new Labour Code in relation to fixed-term employment contracts are also analysed, comparison in regard to the available Labour Code is carried out, differences and novelties are reviewed. Conclusions reveal topics of <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> within the new Labour Code of the Republic of Lithuania. It is concluded, that Lithuania eliminates the prohibition to draw fixed-term employment contracts for execution of works with non-temporary nature, to be more precise, it eliminates objective reason to draw <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> and this fact shall change legal practice of Lithuanian courts, interpreting objective reasons for drafting a <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> only for execution of work of temporary nature. With reference to the European Union Directive 1999 / 70 /EC Regarding Fixed-Term Employment Contracts, Lithuania in the new Labour Code selects not all instruments preventing misuse of fixed-term employment contracts, that is, it defines only net maximum duration of fixed-term employment contracts in a row as 2 years, in exceptional cases – 5 years. Nevertheless, it clearly defines application of the principle of non-discrimination. Cases, when the contract is considered as fixed-term one and allocation of severance grant is also provided, contrary to the current Labour Code, where severance grants are not envisaged...|$|E
40|$|In Germany, it {{has become}} {{conventional}} wisdom that the economic uncertainty associated fixed-term employment contracts prevents young couples from realizing their desire to have children. From a research perspective, it is however far from clear whether fixed-term contracts are the obstacle to family formation that the public a priori expect them to be. In this paper, we first develop a simple dynamic bargaining model {{that allows us to}} ask theoretically: under what conditions will couples choose to have children early on in life, postpone it to later in life, or decide to remain childless? And: to what extent does the economic uncertainty associated with holding <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> affect these choices? We obtain two theoretical predictions. On the one hand, job uncertainty at the beginning of women's employment careers causes couples to postpone parenthood. On the other hand, job uncertainty in women's mid-career lives causes couples to enter parenthood instead of remaining voluntarily childless. We bring these theoretical predictions to data from the German Socio-Economimc Panel (SOEP). Ordinary least squares and fixed-effects estimations show that, at the beginning of women's employment careers, holding a <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> and the probability of entering parenthood are negatively correlated. When considering women in their mid-career lives, holding a fixed-term contract has a positive impact on the probability of entering parenthood...|$|E

These concerns were already present {{at the end of}} the 1990 s, when some provisions were taken at European level to address the issue. In order to improve the quality of fixed-term work and to prevent abuse arising from the use of successive <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> (excluding apprenticeship and training schemes and temporary agency work contracts), the interprofessional European social partners’ organisations concluded the European framework agreement on fixed-term contracts on 18 March 1999 (ETUC et al, 1999), later transposed into Directive 1999 / 70 /EC. The directive: sets out a general principle of non-discrimination against fixed-term employees compared with permanent employees;details responsibilities on the part of the employer in terms of informing workers on fixed-term contracts about vacancies in the organisation; and sets out measures aimed at preventing abuses. In particular, the directive requires Member States to introduce one or more of the following measures: objective reasons justifying the renewal of fixed-term contracts the maximum total duration of successive <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> or relationships the number of renewals of such contracts or relationships...|$|R

40|$|Many people {{consider}} the softening of regulations under the Agency Work Law as excessive deregulation. However, the tightening of regulations {{that are currently}} under way or {{are expected to be}} implemented in the field of employment laws is more properly called excessive regulation. The typical form of non-regular employment is part-time employment, but agency work accounts for only one-ninth of part-time employment. Excluding students and people 65 or older, growth in non-regular employment has clearly been slowing in recent years. Even though casual employment has increased, regular employment has grown at a faster pace. For both men and women, regular employees account for a historically high percentage of total employment. Although for women, growth in casual employment has surpassed that for men, there has been a major decline in unpaid family workers. If one considers that these unpaid family workers have become paid casual employees, it is not necessarily true that unstable employment has increased. In the debate regarding the strengthening of regulations of non-regular employment, many people are swept away by momentary arguments charged with emotions and based on impressions, and they are not properly aware of these facts. In fact, {{when it comes to the}} agency workers, which has become the target of efforts to strengthen regulations, there is conspicuous excessive regulation. In terms of work related to the operation of office equipment, the typical type of work for agency workers, there is a strange phenomenon that the number of agency workers continues to decline even though the economy has slightly recovered. It is expected that after the strengthening of regulations under the Agency Work Law, the tightening of regulations of fixed-term employment, that is the restricting the case of concluding the <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> to temporary jobs will be implemented. It is, however, overly optimistic to assume that restricting fixed-term employment will lead to an increase in regular employment. Without an appropriate level of regulation, workplaces will not be able to cope with these regulations. This must not be forgotten. ...|$|E
40|$|Julkaistu vain painettuna, saatavuus katso Bibid. Published only in printed form, {{availability}} see BibidIn {{the first}} two essays of this thesis we consider an agent seeking a renewal of his <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract.</b> The renewal depends {{on the outcome of}} a review performed by a committee of principals. Depending on the agent's past performance, some principals find it optimal to reappoint the agent while the others do not. In particular, each principal has a private threshold that reflects the minimum requirements the agent should have fulfilled in order to become reappointed. All principals agree, however, that the better the agent has performed, the greater their payoff from the reappointment. Each principal reviews {{a different part of the}} agent's performance, and the final decision on the renewal is made collectively by voting.   In the first essay of this thesis we analyze a scenario where all communication is prohibited. The contributions of the essay are twofold. First, we show that informative voting constitutes an equilibrium whenever the number of votes required for the reappointment is sufficiently high. Second, we show that the game possesses a responsive equilibrium under all voting rules.   In the second essay of this thesis we then allow the principals to engage in a pre-vote deliberation. We establish the necessary conditions under which the game with communication possesses a fully revealing equilibrium. We then compare the principals' expected payoffs in the fully revealing equilibrium to their expected payoffs in the pure voting game. In contrast to common conception, we find that in some circumstances, the principals' expected payoffs in the pure voting game actually exceed those in the game with communication. That is, it may sometimes be in the principals' best interest to waive the opportunity to communicate and just vote. The underlying intuition is that the coordination failures that prevail in the pure voting game may actually force the agent to perform at a level beyond that in the game with communication. In the third essay we return to study a pure voting game, but modify the above framework by adding uncertainty into the principals' ability to review the agent's performance. In this revised setup, we show that for large committees, non-unanimous voting rules fully aggregate the available information and eliminate all decision-making errors. As a result, the agent's incentives are not distorted by the voters' inability to efficiently aggregate information and his optimal strategy thus coincides with the one that is socially optimal. For committees of reasonable sizes, we find that the agent's incentives may feature non-monotone behavior with respect to both the voter's threshold of reasonable doubt and the voting rule. This suggests that the agent is provided with maximal incentives by a committee whose standards are strict but yet attainable...|$|E
40|$|<b>Fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> {{has become}} {{increasingly}} common in the Swedish labour market, despite that the stated main rule is permanent employment. The phenomenon affects different groups in society, especially since statistics indicate that it is mainly women, young and foreign-born people who have fixed-term contracts. Sweden was notified from the European Commission for not having {{lived up to the}} minimum requirements that the Council Directive 1999 / 70 /EC framework agreement on fixed-term work issued. Several years of correspondence resulted in that Sweden was faced with the risk {{to stand in front of}} the Court of Justice of the European Union on charges of infringement if the law was not changed. A new law was presented May 1 2016. Lawmakers had here taken up by the Directive's requirement of maximum total duration of successive <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contracts.</b> This resulted in giving 5 § of the employment protection act, a bigger possibility to convert fixed- term <b>contracts</b> into permanent <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> than before. The purpose of this paper is to look at the differences between different social groups and job security, and to examine, illuminate and analyze the problem of <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> for different groups of workers and to set this in relation to the EU Directive on fixed-term. To answer the purpose of the essay and research questions the doctrinal method has been used to interpret, investigate and determine the applicable law. The new legislation has made it much more difficult for employers to misuse of fixed-term contracts, but it is very difficult to interpret the provisions of the law. In my opinion, unnecessarily complicated which is an important factor that can make the new legislation ineffective. ...|$|R

In 2003, Poland introduced regulations regarding the employment of temporary workers. There was a sharp increase in demand for the services of temporary work agencies. The number of temporary workers rose from 0. 23 % of total employment in 2003 to 3. 27 % in 2012. Using empirical data, the author analyses the impact of temporary work agencies on the number of the unemployed. The results show that with {{the increase in the number}} of temporary work agencies, the number of the unemployed fell. Each agency employed an average of 795 unemployed. The largest group of temporary workers were those unemployed for 6 to 24 months. agrzes@uwb. edu. plFaculty of Economics and Management, University of Bialysto...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} divided into two {{distinct}} sections. The first being an analysis of the legal protection of temporary employees as things currently stand. It deals with the various labour laws that currently regulate temporary employment as well as the temporary employment contract and the common-law. The second section summarises and analyses the provisions of the Labour Relations Amendment Bill and the Basic Conditions of Employment Bill as they apply to fixed-term employees. Temporary employees are protected by the general protection extended to all employees in terms of section 23 (1) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, guaranteeing all employees the “right to fair labour practice”. The Labour Relations Act has as one of its main objectives to give effect to and regulate the fundamental rights contained in the Constitution. Thus the Labour Relations Act must not only give effect to constitutional rights but it must also ensure that it in no way unreasonably or unjustly denies or limits constitutional rights. Temporary employees have a number of labour laws protecting their interests. Where the provisions of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, a Bargaining Council Agreement or a Sectoral Determination do not apply the employee will rely on the terms of the <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> and thereafter the common law for protection. The only protection offered to temporary employees contained in the Labour Relations Act is in section 186 (1) (b), where a dismissal is defined to include the non-renewal of temporary contracts of employment where there is a reasonable expectation of renewal on the same or similar terms. This provision has proved to be highly controversial in that it does not expressly cater for temporary employees who harbour reasonable expectations of indefinite employment. An analysis is made of the most important cases relating to section 186 (1) (b). The second section unpacks and critically analyses the Labour Relations Amendment Bill and the Basic Conditions of Employment Bill which have been long in the offing and when they are finally enacted, will bring with them sweeping changes for atypical employment. The amendments will drastically change the way employers make use of fixed-term employees as well as the way in which Temporary Employment Services may conduct business if they are in fact able to keep working at all. There is very little literature of substance written about the Labour Relations Amendment Bill as it applies to atypical employment. The fact that the proposed amendments have changed so many times over such {{a long period of time}} might have deterred many writers from investing time and effort in attempts to analyse and summarise the amendments. Articles posted on the internet are in the main short and have very little content. No books were found with any discussion that pertains to the amendments. The amendments divide employees involved in atypical employment into two different categories. These categories consist of employees earning above the threshold in terms of section 6 (3) of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act and those earning below this threshold. All fixed-term employees may rely on the provisions of section 186 of the Labour Relations Act. Employees earning below the threshold are considered to be the most vulnerable and have been afforded additional protections in terms of sections 198 (A), (B) and (C). Issues surrounding Temporary Employment Services and fixed-term employees have been very divisive and have been the topics of heated debate at all levels of Industrial Relations for a long time.

40|$|This paper investigates how {{executive}} <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> influence corporate {{financial policies}} {{during the final}} year of the contract term, using a new, hand-collected data set of CEO employment agreements. On the one hand, the impending expiration of <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> creates incentives for CEOs to engage in strategic window-dressing activities. We find that, compared to normal periods, CEOs manage earnings more aggressively when they {{are in the process of}} contract renegotiations. Correspondingly, during CEO contract renewal times, firms are more likely to report earnings that meet or narrowly beat analyst consensus forecasts. Moreover, CEOs also reduce the amount of negative firm news released during their contract negotiation years. On the other hand, we find that merger and acquisition deals announced during the contract renegotiation year yield higher announcement returns than deals announced during other periods, suggesting that the upcoming contract expiration and renewal can also have disciplinary effects on potential value-destroying behaviors of CEOs. In addition, we show that firms whose CEOs are scheduled or expected to leave their posts upon contract expiration do not experience such corporate policy changes in the contract ending year and that CEOs who engage in manipulation during contract renewal obtain better employment terms in their new contracts, in terms o...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine claims that the removal of tenure in favour of <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> has led to some {{politicization}} of top-level appointments in the Samoa public service. The intention is not only to shed light on how politicization is perceived in a small developing society, but also to determine whether such claims are well founded and if so, what the implications are for a small public service like that in Samoa. Design/methodology/approach – Data are gathered from government documents, literature review and the experience of the author as a former senior public servant in Samoa. Findings – While the claims cannot be fully endorsed at this stage, it is clear that there was some politicization of senior public service appointments and, importantly, the outcomes in most cases were unfavourable for Samoa's public service. Originality/value – Politicization of the appointment of Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) in Samoa's public service since the shift to <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> in the early 1990 s has not previously been reviewed. Apparently the ramifications of politicizing the appointment of CEOs have, in most cases, proved unproductive for the public service and its stakeholders. Hence the Public Service Commission, which is the main advisory body, urgently needs to recommend necessary changes to avert political appointments in the future. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the role of}} <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> in the job dynamics of firms in Baden-Württemberg in 2001. Although only 4. 4 percent of the workers have a fixed-term contract, {{more than a quarter}} of all hirings occur on the basis of such a contract. Fixed term contracts are used by declining firms more than by expanding firms: in declining firms some 44 percent of the hirings are in the form of <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> relationships, which could probably be attributed to the uncertain business development in these firms. Of the temporary employees whose fixed-term contracts expired in 2001, approximately 51 percent changed to a permanent employment relationship in the same firm, whilst approximately 49 percent left the firm. The rate at which fixed-term employees are made permanent is clearly higher in growing firms. There in particular <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> is obviously not only used as a short-term adjustment instrument, but also in order to try out newly hired employees. Further findings of the data analysis concern the simultaneous inflow and outflow of workers into and out of the firm, which is known as rotation or churning. The churning rate stands at almost 65 percent of overall employment, i. e. almost two thirds of the turnover serves to exchange employees without it being associated with the creation or cutting of jobs. The results also show that the firms frequently offer the workers fixed-term contracts when refilling jobs, even though the jobs were previously permanent ones. If this phenomenon is compared with the number of conversions of fixed-term contracts into permanent ones, it can be seen that on balance no displacement of regular employment can be determined.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Almost {{a decade}} {{on from the}} New Zealand Primary Health Care Strategy and amidst {{concerns}} about funding of health promotion, we undertook a nationwide survey of health promotion providers. AIM: To identify trends in recruitment and turnover in New Zealand’s health promotion workforce. METHODS: Surveys were sent to 160 organisations identified as having a health focus and employing one or more health promoter. Respondents, primarily health promotion managers, were asked to report budget, retention and hiring data for 1 July 2009 through 1 July 2010. RESULTS: Responses were received from 53 % of organisations. Among respondents, government funding for health promotion declined by 6. 3 % in the year ended July 2010 and health promoter positions decreased by 7. 5 % (equalling 36. 6 full-time equivalent positions). Among staff who left their roles, 79 % also left {{the field of health}} promotion. Forty-two organisations (52 %) reported employing health promoters on time-limited contracts of three years or less; this employment arrangement was particularly common in public health units (80 %) and primary health organisations (57 %). Among new hires, 46 % (n= 55) were identified as Māori. DISCUSSION: Low retention of health promoters may reflect the common use of limited-term <b>employment</b> <b>contracts,</b> which allow employers to alter staffing levels as funding changes. More than half the surveyed primary health organisations reported using <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contracts.</b> This may compromise health promotion understanding, culture and institutional memory in these organisations. New Zealand’s commitment to addressing ethnic inequalities in health outcomes was evident in the high proportion of Māori who made up new hires...|$|R

En dichos pronunciamientos el TJUE estima contraria al Derecho de la Unión la utilización de nombramientos de duración determinada sucesivos para atender necesidades permanentes en el sector de los servicios de salud. Asimismo, señala que la normativa española debe establecer medidas efectivas para evitar los abusos en lo referente a las relaciones de servicio de duración determinada al margen de su regulación a través del Derecho laboral o administrativo.

30|$|The {{originality}} of our paper lies in {{our focus}} on the intergenerational exchange of time in Italy and France in the early 2000 s. In particular, we estimate, from a gender perspective, the relative contribution to domestic activities of young {{people living in the}} parental home or elsewhere. In this way, we indirectly compare the level of domestic comfort enjoyed by young people in Italy and in France, which—all things being equal—can be an additional reason for staying in the nest. Italy and France are two of the few countries for which we have fit the data to examine this issue. The time-use surveys conducted in the early 2000 s interviewed all members of the household. Furthermore, these two closely neighbouring countries represent two highly interesting cases for exploring this issue, as they show some similarities in the economic constraints that young people may have to face, though the economic constraints seem harsher in Italy than France partly due to welfare support being less developed. In both countries (see Appendix) during the early 2000 s, the youth unemployment rate was high (15 % in France, 22 % in Italy), and <b>fixed-term</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> were highly prevalent (around 17 – 18 % of young employees in both countries held temporary jobs), such that a large share of young people was neither in employment nor in education, and they were at risk of poverty and social exclusion, more so in Italy than in France. Welfare support for young people was more developed in France than in Italy (Appendix), where the familialist Mediterranean model continues to prevail and help from the state remains scarce (Thévenon, 2015). For instance, 35 % of students in France receive grants, whereas they are only 8 % in Italy, which is still the case in 2015. Housing subsidies for young adults are more developed in France and provide an incentive to parents and children to have independent dwellings (Laferrere and Le Blanc 2004). Except for these housing subsidies, social transfers dedicated to young people remain scarce in France (Thévenon, 2015).|$|R
