500|$|Compared to {{most other}} raptors which mostly nest in April or May, bald eagles are early breeders: nest {{building}} or reinforcing is often by mid-February, egg laying is often late February (sometimes during deep {{snow in the}} North), and incubation is usually mid-March and early May. Eggs hatch from mid April to early May, and the young fledge late June to early July. The nest is the largest of any bird in North America; it is used repeatedly over many years and with new material added each year may eventually be as large as [...] deep, [...] across and weigh one nest in Florida {{was found to be}} [...] deep, [...] across, and to weigh [...] This nest is on record as the largest tree nest ever recorded for any animal. Usually nests are used for under <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> as they either collapse in storms or break the branches supporting them by their sheer weight. However, one nest in the Midwest was occupied continuously for at least 34 years. The nest is built out of branches, usually in large trees found near water. When breeding where there are no trees, the bald eagle will nest on the ground, as has been recorded largely in areas largely isolated from terrestrial predators, such as Amchitka Island in Alaska. In Sonora, Mexico, eagles have been observed nesting on top of Hecho catcuses (Pachycereus pectinaboriginum). Nests located on cliffs and rock pinnacles have been reported historically in California, Kansas, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah, but currently are only verified to occur only in Alaska and Arizona. The eggs average about [...] long, ranging from , and have a breadth of , ranging from [...] Eggs in Alaska averaged [...] in mass, while in Saskatchewan they averaged [...] As with their ultimate body size, egg size tends to increase further away from the Equator. Eagles produce between one and three eggs per year, two being typical. Rarely, four eggs have been found in nests but these may be exceptional cases of polygyny. Eagles in captivity have been capable of producing up to seven eggs. it is rare for all three chicks to successfully reach the fledging stage. The oldest chick often bears the advantage of larger size and louder voice, which tends to draw the parents attention towards it. Occasionally, as is recorded in many large raptorial birds, the oldest sibling sometimes attacks and kills its younger sibling(s), especially early in the nesting period when their sizes are most different. However, nearly half of known bald eagle produce two fledgings (more rarely three), unlike in some other [...] "eagle" [...] species such as some in the Aquila genus, in which a second fledging is typically observed in less than 20% of nests, despite two eggs typically being laid. Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs, but the female does most of the sitting. The parent not incubating will hunt for food or look for nesting material during this stage. For the first two to three weeks of the nestling period, at least one adult is at the nest almost 100% of the time. After five to six weeks, the attendance of parents usually drops off considerably (with the parents often perching in trees nearby). A young eaglet can gain up to [...] a day, the fastest growth rate of any North American bird. The young eaglets pick up and manipulate sticks, play tug of war with each other, practice holding things in their talons, and stretch and flap their wings. By eight weeks, the eaglets are strong enough to flap their wings, lift their feet off the nest platform, and rise up in the air. The young fledge at anywhere from 8 to 14 weeks of age, though will remain close to the nest and attended to by their parents for a further 6 weeks. Juvenile eagles first start dispersing away from their parents about 8 weeks after they fledge. Variability in departure date related to effects of sex and hatching order on growth and development. For the next four years, immature eagles wander widely in search of food until they attain adult plumage and are eligible to reproduce. Additionally, as shown by a pair of eagles in Shoal Harbor Migratory Bird Sanctuary located near Sydney, British Columbia on June 9, 2017, bald eagles have been recently recorded to occasionally adopt other raptor fledglings into their nests. The pair of eagles in question were recorded carrying a juvenile red-tailed hawk back to their nest, whereupon the chick was accepted into the family by both the parents and the eagles' three fledgelings. Whether or not the chick survived remained to be seen at the time, as bald eagles are known for committing fratricide amongst their siblings. However, the aggression of the red-tailed hawk may ensure its survival, as the hawks are well known for their ability to successfully defend against an eagle attack. Six weeks after however, it was discovered that the hawk, nicknamed [...] "Spunky" [...] by biologists monitoring the nest, had grown to fledgeling size and was learning how to hunt, indicating that it successfully survived.|$|E

50|$|In 2008, the LICPA {{joined the}} {{national}} institutes of Ghana and Nigeria in promoting a semi-professional credentialing examinations known as the Accounting Technicians Scheme, West Africa (ATSWA. The ATSWA exams, which are a uniform mid level exam for accountants in West Africa, are currently administered in English speaking West Africa {{under the auspices of the}} Association of Accountancy Bodies in West Africa (ABWA) of which the LICPA is a founding member. ATSWA exams is currently administered, as a foundation professional exam for aspiring professional accountants, in all but one English-speaking countries in West Africa, the sole exception being The Gambia, which expects to commence the ATSWA exam in September, 2014. Professional ExaminationsThe LICPA does not yet have a full professional accounting credentialing program of its own. However, under a Memorandum of Understanding signed with the Institute of Chartered Accountants, Ghana (ICAG)in 2010, the LICPA, starting 2011, administers the professional accounting examination of the Ghanaian Institute as the LICPA's pre-admission exams. Based on the results of that examination, a successful LICPA candidate becomes eligible for admission into the Institute as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), Liberia and also into the Ghanaian Institute as a Chartered Accountant, Ghana (CA, Gh). Accounting Education in Liberian UniversitiesUnder funding provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under its Governance Economic Management Support (GEMS) program to Liberia, the Liberian Institute has, starting September 2013, launched a program, called Syllabi Integration Program (SIP), which aims to raise the standards of accounting education in Liberia to a global level within <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> and in the process also correct a number of ills that are endemic in the educational system of Liberia. Under the Program, the Institute integrates the syllabi of the two credentialing programs mentioned above (ATSWA and the ICAG Professional exams) into the accounting curricula of Liberian tertiary institutions of learning that elect to partner with the LICPA in its national capacity building effort. The syllabi integration is such that students in participating schools are expected to qualify as professional accountants by the time they meet standard academic requirements for graduation or be close to doing so by then. The idea is that having been brought that close to professional qualification, students in participating schools who do not qualify as professional accountants by the time they complete the academic requirements of each participating school will, on their own seek professional qualification on their own even after graduation. The Institute expects that this way, it will substantially increase number of Liberian professional accountants, who are currently in very short supply. Under the Program student in participating schools are required to pass corresponding external exams administered by LICPA, as part of the credentialing programs outlined above, in order to obtain academic credit in his school. However, the Council of the Institute recognizes that, unless suitably ameliorated, that requirement is inherently unfair to students at participating institutions where, with rare exceptions, the instructors who teach in those schools are unfamiliar with professional accounting exams. To address that challenge, the Institute works in collaboration with the Liberian Institute of Public Administration (LIPA), a funding beneficiary of the GEMS program of the USAID in Liberia. Thus under funding provided for the purpose by the USAID, the two Liberian capacity building institutes hire the services of experienced expatriate professional accountants who teach at participating universities as full-time instructors whose specific brief includes coaching students in each participating university to pass the LICPA's semi-professional and its full professional exams. Together with GEMS, the two partnering institutes hire the instructors; LIPA handles administration of the Program while the LICPA concentrates on the academic aspects of the Program. Although GEMS pays the expatriate instructors hired under the Program as outlined above, participating schools are allowed to collect tuition from students, with the specific understanding that each school will then use the tuition collected to sponsor as many of its regular accounting instructors, who so desire, to take the professional exams of the LICPA. Separate tutorial classes and separate examination centers are to be maintained for instructors, who will not be required to sit in the same classrooms or take any exams at the same centers with regular students. Successful instructors then join the GEMS supported teaching pool; initialing limiting the number of expatriate teaching staff that are brought into Liberia in the hope that eventually they will fully replace their expatriate counterparts. This way, the SIP is expected to become indefinitely sustainable, starting <b>five</b> (5) <b>years</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> from its inception. All parties, GEMS, USAID, the World Bank, LICPA, the Liberian Institute of Public Administration (LIPA) and the authorities of participating tertiary institutions readily agree that the SIP has great potential for advancing the quality of accounting education in Liberia to global standards.|$|R
