The most widely used electrolytes for the <b>electropolishing</b> of stainless steel are varying concentrations of phosphoric and sulphuric acid, and occasionally additives such as chromic acid.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of surface roughness span {{a range of}} length scales determined {{by the nature of}} the surface generation process. The mechanism by which material is removed at a length scale determines the roughness at that scale. <b>Electropolishing</b> preferentially reduces the peaks of surface protuberances at sub-micron length scales to produce smooth surfaces. The material removal in <b>electropolishing</b> occurs by two different mechanisms of anodic leveling and microsmoothing. Due to insufficient lateral resolution, individual contribution of these two mechanisms could not be measured by conventional roughness measurement techniques and parameters. In this work, we utilize the high lateral resolution offered by Atomic force microscopy along with the power spectral density method of characterization, to study the evolution of roughness during <b>electropolishing.</b> The power spectral density show two corner frequencies indicating the length scales over which the two mechanisms operate.

In this work, one dimensional average PSD functions derived from topography of BCP and EP with different controlled starting conditions and durations have been fitted with a combination of power law, K correlation, and shifted Gaussian models to extract characteristic parameters at different spatial harmonic scales. While the simplest characterizations of these data are not new, the systematic tracking of scale-specific roughness as a function of processing is new and offers feedback for tighter process prescriptions more knowledgably targeted at beneficial niobium topography for superconducting radio frequency applications...|$|E
40|$|A {{simplified}} {{numerical model}} has been developed to simulate nonlinear superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) losses on Nb surfaces. This study focuses exclusively on excessive surface resistance (R_{s}) losses due to the microscopic topographical magnetic field enhancements. When the enhanced local surface magnetic field exceeds the superconducting critical transition magnetic field H_{c}, small volumes of surface material may become normal conducting and increase the effective surface resistance without inducing a quench. We seek to build an improved quantitative characterization of this qualitative model. Using topographic data from typical buffered chemical polish (BCP) - and <b>electropolish</b> (EP) -treated fine grain niobium, we have estimated the resulting field-dependent losses and extrapolated this model to the implications for cavity performance.
