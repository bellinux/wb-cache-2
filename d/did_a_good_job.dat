5|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Writer Gordon stated that director Bowman {{did a great}} job in mining his script for chills. In their book, X-Treme Possibilities, authors Keith Topping and Paul Cornell praised the episode, including Benzali's performance and the sequence in the graveyard {{at the end of the}} episode. Series creator Chris Carter called the episode one of the ones he was most proud of from the second season, stating that Gordon <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> with the script and Bowman {{did a great job}} with the directing.|$|E

He also <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> of bringing the car home, a highlight being ninth at Pau. In Noda's third season in F3000, he switched to the Forti Corse team to drive a Reynard 94D Cosworth as teammate to Pedro Diniz.|$|E
25|$|Day Two (13 March): Australia {{found the}} {{inspiration}} {{they needed to}} get back into the match via their great fast bowler, Dennis Lillee. He took the wicket of Mike Brearley straight away, and within half an hour, England had crumbled to 5 for 40. Tony Greig mounted a very brief counterattack, hitting three fours, but he succumbed for 18 (the top score of the innings) and the crowd were stunned and elated when England finished with 95 off 34.3 overs. Lillee dominated proceedings, capturing a personal best of 6 for 26, ably supported by the medium pace of Max Walker, whose four wickets destroyed the middle order. With three and a half hours to go, to be followed by three full days of play, Australia needed not only a big score, but a long innings to allow the wicket to wear and make life difficult for England chasing a big target. Australia promoted spin bowler Kerry O'Keefe to open the batting in place of McCosker and he <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job,</b> lasting until the new ball lost its shine. But England struck a decisive blow after O'Keefe departed, removing the Australian dangerman Chappell for two and Cosier for four, leaving Australia 3 for 53. Opener Ian Davis was still at the crease and he combined with veteran Doug Walters to add a half century partnership in the time remaining before stumps, leaving the match evenly poised.|$|E

500|$|The series {{received}} mixed reviews. Some critics praised Wolfman's writing, {{while others}} {{said that although}} the setting was a good comic book incentive and a good prequel for the video game series, the story did not make sense.

500|$|Lawrence Tierney guest {{starred in}} the episode as Don Brodka. Another former show runner, Josh Weinstein, called Tierney's {{appearance}} [...] "the craziest guest star experience we ever had". In addition to yelling at and intimidating employees of the show, Tierney made unreasonable requests, such as abandoning his distinctive voice to do the part in a southern accent and refusing to perform lines {{if he did not}} [...] "get the jokes". Despite this, Oakley and Weinstein thought Tierney <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job.</b> Weinstein said, [...] "He certainly delivered and he's one of my favorite characters we have had [...]" [...] After Tierney's death, the episode [...] "The Old Man and the Key" [...] was dedicated to him.|$|E

500|$|On {{the story}} side, reviewers agreed the {{professional}} actors, such as Ian Ziering, <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> in bringing their respective characters to life. [...] However, criticism {{was placed on}} the lone voice who voiced all the generic male encounters for his monotonous delivery and making all his characters sound alike. [...] The long cutscenes, which cannot be skipped, frustrated game journalist Tom Chick; he wanted to skip the scenes and continue playing instead of being forced to watch a clichéd story. [...] Other reviewers expressed their own frustrations with the story, such as being forced to move to another star system at undesired times, or leaving them without an objective after the campaign abruptly ended.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of [...] "White Tulip" [...] were {{overwhelmingly}} positive. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly {{enjoyed the}} episode, writing [...] "Fringe is becoming ever more adroit at blending its mythology with its paranormal cases". He also praised guest star Peter Weller's performance. After initially expecting a [...] "filler" [...] episode, Ramsey Isler of IGN {{said he was}} [...] "pleasantly proven wrong", as the [...] "story {{turned out to be}} one of the best of the series". Isler continued that [...] "the writers really <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> of integrating the overall mythology into a standalone story that is actually damn good... It's brilliant storytelling". Andrew Hanson of Los Angeles Times enjoyed the episode, but wished Astrid got more screen time.|$|E
500|$|Many {{critics of}} the time and since have {{declared}} it Cagney's best film, drawing parallels between Cohan and Cagney; they both began their careers in vaudeville, struggled for years before reaching the peak of their profession, were surrounded with family and married early, and both had a wife who was happy to sit back while he went on to stardom. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won three, including Cagney's for Best Actor. In his acceptance speech, Cagney said, [...] "I've always maintained that in this business, you're {{only as good as the}} other fellow thinks you are.

500|$|Co-writer James Wong {{felt that}} the changes {{he was asked to}} make to the script led to [...] "Shadows" [...] turning out to be [...] "an average episode", {{although}} he felt [...] "the director <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> with it". His partner Glen Morgan had a similar opinion, calling it [...] "a little too ordinary, like you have seen it before, which is exactly what the network wanted at the time. Chris Carter had a more positive view of the episode, calling it [...] "very well done, really great effects, and more of a meat-and-potatoes kind of story. An FBI sting and a good mystery that Mulder and Scully investigate. Overall, a really solid episode." [...] The plot for [...] "Shadows" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 2000 by Ellen Steiber, under the title Haunted.|$|E
500|$|The first segment, [...] "The Devil and Homer Simpson", {{was written}} by Daniels and McGrath. The first time Devil Flanders appears, he looks {{the same as the}} devil Chernabog from the 1940 Walt Disney {{produced}} film Fantasia; Silverman particularly admired the animation in that sequence. Oakley loved the idea of Flanders being the Devil because he is the one you would least expect. He also thought Harry Shearer <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> of playing Flanders in a much darker way, while remaining very true to the character. Many scenes had to be cut to shorten the segment, including one that showed Homer's severed head being used as a bowling ball by a demon in hell.

500|$|Several critics {{praised the}} game's {{real-time}} strategy elements and graphics. IGN considered {{the high quality}} of The Battle for Middle-earth II proof that Electronic Arts was truly interested in building great real-time strategy games. Despite a few minor issues, GameZone was happy with the gameplay of The Battle for Middle-earth II, believing that the game <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> of enabling the player to experience the turmoil of the fantasy world. They also admired the game's conversion for the Xbox 360 version, calling it [...] "one of the best PC-to-console conversions" [...] and praising the developers for a [...] "commendable job of assigning actions to the 360 controller’s eight buttons".

Before broadcast, Smith stated that it was [...] "maybe [...] favorite episode to date...it just rockets along". Smith's Doctor debuted his secondary jacket, a long dark-green military overcoat, {{for the first time in}} this episode. In an interview for the previous series concerning the Eleventh Doctor's costume, executive producer Piers Wenger said, [...] "I think he'd really like to evolve it next series. He's really keen to have a coat." [...] Smith explained that he wanted a coat because of the cold weather.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} from {{television}} critics were generally positive. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly enjoyed the scenes set at Massive Dynamic, and thought the episode <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> tricking the audience into thinking Peter was {{not responsible for the}} shapeshifter killings. After not loving the previous week's episode, Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times thought [...] "Reciprocity" [...] had [...] "all the aspects of Fringe I loved". Hanson particularly loved the opening's first few minutes, and like Tucker, he was pleasantly surprised about Peter and the murders. The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded [...] "Reciprocity" [...] with a B, explaining that despite the awe-inspiring opening (which reminded him of the film Close Encounters Of The Third Kind) and the final revelations, Murray found the episode [...] "solid but largely unexceptional". He thought the shapeshifter investigation [...] "lacked a certain frisson" [...] and found the Peter–Olivia relationship scenes to be [...] "more of a drag".|$|E

500|$|Critics {{enjoyed the}} game's visuals. Entertainment Weekly Adam B. Vary thought the game <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> at recreating {{the look and}} feel of the {{original}} manga. Walter called the game's visuals [...] "gorgeous" [...] and [...] "striking", and thought that they were what would get people from places where the manga had not yet become popular interested in the game. Eurogamer Tom Bramwell described the visuals as distinctive, and at times reminiscent of Jet Set Radio. Smith called GioGio's Bizarre Adventure among the most faithful manga-to-video game adaptations he had seen, praising the 3D recreation of the manga's artwork, and said that its use of effects such as speed lines and visual katakana sound effects made it feel familiar. He noted that the environments looked [...] "a little crude" [...] and with blurry textures if one looked at details up close, but that they looked impressive from a distance. Reviewers at Famitsu also enjoyed how the game reproduced the look of the manga in 3D, but noted that the presentation of the story felt insufficient for people who have not read the Vento Aureo manga, and that it seemed mostly targeted towards people who already were fans of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.|$|E
500|$|Joel Keller of TV Squad {{said the}} cast <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> of playing drunk without being overly exaggerated.

Zap2it writer Rick Porter felt the episode was [...] "a little light on plot" [...] but included many funny scenes, particularly Andy and April's role-playing, and Ron's chipper attitude the morning after the bar visit, while everyone else remained hungover. Porter also praised Rashida Jones's performance during her hangover scenes. Matt Fowler of IGN said he enjoyed Tom's efforts to [...] "become a high-roller this season", and said Andy and April were fantastic during their role-playing scenes. Fowler also described Ron's defense of Tom's actions as [...] "heart-warming". He gave the episode a 9 out of 10. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic said he believed Ann's new part-time job would help better integrate her into the cast. McHatton said the sweet scenes between Leslie and Ben are [...] "quickly becoming my favorite scenes in the series", and said a shot of Ron dancing while drunk at the Snakehole Lounge was [...] "easily one of the funniest things he’s done yet".|$|E
