5|$|There {{are local}} names for winds {{associated}} with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust {{during the winter}} into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere <b>for</b> <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time across the Persian Gulf states.|$|E
5|$|Amid this {{environment}} of intense internal pressure {{for the band}} to break through to widespread popularity, the band relocated to Marietta, Georgia in late 1992 to begin work on their second album, with Butch Vig returning as producer. The decision to record {{so far away from}} their hometown was motivated partly by the band's desire to avoid friends and distractions during the recording, but largely as a desperate attempt to cut Chamberlin off from his known drug connections. The recording environment for Siamese Dream was quickly marred by discord within the band. As was the case with Gish, Corgan and Vig decided that Corgan should play nearly all of the guitar and bass parts on the album, contributing to an air of resentment. The contemporary music press began to portray Corgan as a tyrant. Corgan's depression, meanwhile, had deepened {{to the point where he}} contemplated suicide, and he compensated by practically living in the studio. Meanwhile, Chamberlin quickly managed to find new connections and was often absent without any contact <b>for</b> <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time. In all, it took over four months to complete the record, with the budget exceeding $250,000.|$|E

5|$|Rixey went 22–10 in 1916 with a 1.85ERA and {{a career}} high of 134strikeouts. On June 29, Rixey pitched a four-hit shutout against the New York Giants, facing the minimum 27batters, because of three double plays, and a player caught stealing. In 1917, despite having a 2.27 earned run average, Rixey {{led the league in}} {{pitching}} losses with 21. He also handled 108chances without a single error. Rixey hated losing and was known for destroying the team locker room, or disappearing <b>for</b> <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time after a loss. He missed the 1918 season to serve in the Chemical Warfare Division of the United States army during the war effort. He struggled upon returning to baseball, going 6–12 with a 3.97earned run average in 1919, and again leading the league in losses with 22 in 1920. Prior to the 1920 season, rumours circulated that his former manager, Pat Moran, now with the Cincinnati Reds, was interested in trading for Rixey. The relationship between Rixey and manager Gavvy Cravath was never good, and Cravath had made known his desire to trade him; however, he stayed with the Phillies that season, working on his delivery with former pitcher Jesse Tannehill, who, Rixey admitted, helped with his pitching delivery.|$|E

The Drosso's apartment had been converted to an opium den, subdivided into small rooms filled with low couches and decorations befitting an Arabic setting.

25|$|Many {{deep sea}} fish are at risk, such as orange roughy, Patagonian toothfish, and sablefish. The deep sea is almost {{completely}} dark, near freezing and has little food. Deep sea fish grow slowly because of limited food, have slow metabolisms, low reproductive rates, and many don't reach breeding maturity for 30 to 40 years. A fillet of orange roughy {{at the store}} is probably at least 50 years old. Most deep sea fish are in international waters, {{where there are no}} legal protections. Most of these fish are caught by deep trawlers near seamounts, where they congregate because of food. Flash freezing allows the trawlers to work <b>for</b> <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, and modern fishfinders target the fish with ease.|$|E
25|$|Asda {{had also}} heavily {{increased}} prices across its ranges {{to try to}} offset growing operating costs and increase volume sales and margins which had narrowed within its stores, as a result customers deserted the chain in droves.

That also meant that the company had to temporarily use manual ordering, which of course meant a loss of sales at stores and wastage costs that ran into tens of millions of pounds. Asda was entering a vicious circle with a flawed and compromised trading strategy and with a management team who were floundering and in charge of a company heading into a steady decline.|$|E
