5|$|The {{king and}} queen were not pleased with married life. The royal couple enjoyed periods of calm and affection, but Anne refused to play the {{submissive}} role expected of her.

5|$|The Tales of Ise portrays Narihira as {{falling in}} love with , a consort of Emperor Seiwa, and it is hinted that {{this was one of the}} reasons for his leaving the capital and {{travelling}} east.

However, it has also been speculated that this may be an error in the Sandai Jitsuroku as a result of binding changing the order of events. Furthermore, Fujiwara no Takaiko reputedly <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>affair</b> <b>with</b> the monk , which may have formed the core of the otherwise fictional legend that she also <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>affair</b> <b>with</b> Narihira.
