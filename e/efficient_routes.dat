Heyward has been rated {{as one of}} the top right fielders, if not the top right fielder, in MLB.

40|$|Abstract – Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) are {{important}} in pervasive computing systems, in which users discover and utilize various services to achieve their goals. Integrating service discovery with <b>efficient</b> <b>route</b> discovery protocol in MANETs can greatly improve the efficiency of pervasive computing systems, and hence an <b>efficient</b> <b>route</b> discovery protocol in MANETs is desirable. In this paper, a Location-based Directional Route Discovery (LDRD) protocol with a node location service based on local coordinates in MANETs is presented. In our LDRD protocol, route discovery is only performed in allowed areas using directional route requests. This LDRD protocol is shown to greatly reduce the overhead of route discovery, and improve the efficiency, adaptability and applicability of MANETs in various types of network scenarios...|$|R
50|$|The initial {{idea for}} eNav {{originated}} {{because of the}} lack of support from present Navigation systems for electric wheelchair users. A common navigation system can neither provide information about the incline of the to be traversed route, nor can it estimate whether the planned route can be overcome with the current battery level. Inspired by the project RollStuhlrouting an idea originated, to specify an according navigation-system. Because of the fact that battery level indicators of electric wheelchairs are inaccurate and unreliable, the motivation arises to develop a system with improved battery level detection. Additionally, emerging technologies should be used to calculate an energy <b>efficient</b> <b>route</b> by consideration of topographical characteristics. The user of the navigation system can choose between the shortest and an energy <b>efficient</b> <b>route.</b>|$|R
