They went down like ten-pins. <b>From</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> stood I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on {{unprotected}} skulls. The waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. In two or three minutes the ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down....Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance....They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the fury of the police....The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes for a hundred yards, and throwing them into ditches.|$|E

[...] Along with [...] "Madame George", it {{is the centerpiece of}} the album and both songs are Belfast related and highly impressionistic.

Van Morrison described Cyprus Avenue as [...] "a street in Belfast, [...] a place where there's a lot of wealth.

I didn't know what the right direction was. And the horse trotted and galloped along. Now and then he would forget he was on the highway and start into a field.
