50|$|Negative inotropic agents {{decrease}} myocardial contractility, and {{are used}} to decrease cardiac workload in conditions such as angina. While negative <b>inotropism</b> may precipitate or exacerbate heart failure, certain beta blockers (e.g. carvedilol, bisoprolol and metoprolol) have been believed to reduce morbidity and mortality in congestive heart failure. Quite recently, however, the effectiveness of beta blockers has come under renewed critical scientific scrutiny.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{explanations}} is {{the inability of}} the Na+/K+-ATPase to keep up with influx of sodium at higher heart rates. When a higher heart rate occurs, for example due to adrenergic stimulation, the L Type Calcium channel has increased activity. The 3Na+/Ca++ exchanger (which allows 3 Na+ to flow down its gradient in exchange for 1 Ca++ ion to flow out of the cell) works to decrease the levels of intracellular calcium. As the heart rate becomes more robust and the length of diastole decreases, the Na+/K+-ATPase which removes the Na+ brought into the cell by the Na+/Ca++ exchanger does not keep up with the rate of Na+ influx. This leads to a less efficient Na+/Ca++ exchange since the gradient is decreasing for sodium and the driving force behind calcium transport is actually the concentration gradient of sodium, therefore Ca++ builds up within the cell. This results in an accumulation of calcium in the myocardial cell via the sodium calcium exchanger and leads to a greater state of <b>inotropism,</b> a mechanism which is also seen with cardiac glycosides.|$|E
40|$|Uridine 5 '-triphosphate (UTP) and {{adenosine}} 5 '-triphosphate (ATP) induce biphasic inotropic effects: first {{a decrease}} {{and then an}} increase in contractile tension were observed in isolated rat myocardial tissues. Inotropic effects were higher in atrial tissue than in ventricular or papillary muscle; thus, experiments were mostly carried out on rat atria. In this research, we mainly studied positive <b>inotropism</b> by using selective inhibitors of the arachidonic acid cascade. The natural compounds luffariellolide and aristolochic acid, two inhibitors of PLA 2, both inhibited positive <b>inotropism</b> by UTP but not by ATP, whereas they did not modify their negative <b>inotropism.</b> Indomethacin (5 micromol/l), an inhibitor of COX- 1, reduced positive <b>inotropism</b> by UTP but not by ATP, without modifying their negative <b>inotropism.</b> Nimesulide (1 micromol/l), an inhibitor of COX- 2, did not change any of the effects caused by nucleotides. Nor did NDGA (10 micromol/l), an inhibitor of lipoxygenase, change <b>inotropism</b> by nucleotides. Arachidonic acid pretreatment (10 micromol/l) increased inotropic effects by UTP without affecting those of ATP.

Chiefly, we investigated intracellular mechanisms responsible for the positive <b>inotropism.</b> We tested cromakalim and glibenclamide, an activator and an inhibitor, respectively, of ATP-sensitive K(+) channels. These compounds did not influence the effects of ATP. IBMX, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and H- 7, an inhibitor of protein kinase C and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, did not modify the inotropic effects of ATP. Instead, H- 8, an inhibitor of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, strongly inhibited {{the positive effects of}} both ATP and UTP, suggesting the possible involvement of cGMP in the <b>inotropism.</b> Also, LY 83583, an inhibitor of cGMP production, reduced positive <b>inotropism</b> by alpha,beta-meATP, ATP and UTP. Moreover, 8 -Br-cGMP (50 microM), a stable analogue of cGMP, inhibited positive <b>inotropism</b> by all nucleotides. Lastly, we determined intracellular cGMP levels by RIA; the cyclic nucleotide increased during positive <b>inotropism</b> induced by ATP and UTP.

40|$|Short term {{effect of}} digoxin on left {{ventricular}} performance was studied in six healthy volunteers {{before and during}} atenolol or nifedipine administration. Left ventricular function was evaluated by systolic time intervals and echocardiography. No changes in left ventricular end diastolic or systolic dimensions occurred throughout the study, indicating unchanged ventricular pre- and afterload. Thus, changes in the systolic time intervals must be attributed to changes in cardiac contractility. Changes in the pre-ejection period index (PEPI) obtained from the systolic time intervals were used {{as a measure of}} digoxin-induced <b>inotropism.</b> A concentration-response relationship between plasma digoxin level and changes in PEPI was revealed when digoxin was given alone.

Cardiac performance was evaluated by analyzing left ventricular pressure (LVP) and the rate pressure product (RPP: HR x LVP), used as indexes of contractile activity and cardiac work, respectively. Under basal conditions, STA-CGA 1 - 78 at all concentrations tested elicited a dose-dependent negative <b>inotropism</b> (LVP variations ranging from - 9. 6 % +/- 2 to - 23 % +/- 2. 9) without affecting coronary pressure (CP). In contrast, STA-CGA 1 - 115 increased CP at 110 and 165 nM without affecting <b>inotropism.</b> Both STA-CGA 1 - 78 and STA-CGA 1 - 115 counteracted the cardio-stimulatory effects of isoproterenol (ISO). The ISO-dependent positive chronotropism was unaffected by STA-CGA 1 - 78, while being reduced by STA-CGA 1 - 115.

Genetic ablation of the chromogranin A (Chga) gene in mice increases blood pressure and pretreatment of Chga-null mice with Cts prevents blood pressure elevation, indicating a direct role of Cts in preventing hypertension. This notable vasoreactivity prompted us to test the direct cardiovascular effects and mechanisms of action of wild-type (WT) Cts and naturally occurring human variants (G 364 S-Cts and P 370 L-Cts) on myocardial and coronary functions. The direct cardiovascular actions of WT-Cts and human variants were determined using the Langendorff-perfused rat heart. WT-Cts dose-dependently increased heart rate and coronary pressure and decreased left ventricular pressure, rate pressure product and {{both positive and negative}} LVdP/dt. WT-Cts not only inhibited phospholamban phosphorylation, but also the inotropic and lusitropic effects of WT-Cts were abolished by chemical inhibition of β 2 -adrenergic receptors, Gi/o protein, nitric oxide or cGMP, indicating involvement of β 2 -adrenergic receptors-Gi/o protein-nitric oxide-cGMP signaling mechanisms. In contrast, G 364 S-Cts did not affect basal cardiac performance but abolished isoproterenol-induced positive <b>inotropism</b> and lusitropism.

BioMed. Chem. Lett. 1992, 25, 415 - 418). The structure was confirmed by synthesis starting from beta-truxinic acid obtained by photoaddition of 3, 4 -dimethoxycinnamic acid. The dimer was coupled with 2 mol of prenylagmatine to give caracasandiamide in satisfactory yield. By contrast, the direct photodimerization of caracasanamide was unsuccessful. Caracasandiamide, assayed by the iv route in anesthetized rats at doses ranging from 50 to 3200 mu g/kg of body weight, was found to have! no appreciable effect on heart rate. At lower doses, the drug stimulates breathing and increases cardiac <b>inotropism,</b> stroke volume, and cardiac output, thus augmenting blood pressure and aortic flow. At higher doses, caracasandiamide depresses breathing likely through central neurogenic mechanisms (not involved in the cardiovascular effects), continues to stimulate cardiac <b>inotropism,</b> and induces, by reducing peripheral vascular resistance, arterial hypotension with reduction of both aortic flow and stroke volume. These cardiovascular effects appear to involve complex interactions {{at the level of}} the peripheral beta(1) -, beta(2) -, and alpha(2) -adrenoreceptor-dependent as well as M- 2 - and M- 4 -cholinergic receptor-dependent transductional pathways both in cardiovascular myocells and {{at the level of the}} postganglionic sympathetic endings (with reserpine- and guanethidine-like mechanisms).

The cardiac output (HMV) was determined with the aid of the Swan-Ganz-thermodilution method, the blood pressure was measured wet. The results led to the following conclusions: 1. A decrease in the heart rate (HR) occurs under basal conditions after propranolol, but not after administration ofmepindolol-sulphate. The lack of an effect of mepindolol-sulphate on the HR at rest can be explained by its intrinsic activity. 2. A reduction of the stroke volume (SV) occurs under basal conditions after propranolol, whereas no effect on the SV was observed under mepindolol-sulphate. Three properties ofmepindolol-sulphate are responsible for this lack of effect on the S V, namely its only slight quinidine-like effect compared with propranolol, its intrinsic activity and its only slight affinity for the <b>inotropism</b> receptors at the heart. 3. An infusion of isoproterenol leads to a decrease in the pulmonary capillary pressures (Pc pressures). This effect can be competitively suppressed both with propranolol and with mepindolol-sulphate.

Thirty μM EPI exhibited higher uptake than equimolar DOX, but formed comparable amounts of alcohol metabolite due to its resistance to carbonyl reduction. MEN 10755 exhibited also an impaired uptake, and consequently formed the lowest levels of alcohol metabolite. Accordingly, DOX and EPI inhibited post-rest contractions by ∼ 40 [*]–[*] 50 %, whereas MEN 10755 inhibited by ∼ 6 %. One hundred μM EPI exhibited the same uptake as equimolar DOX, but formed ∼ 50 % less alcohol metabolite.

EPI and MEN 10755 were ∼ 18 % (P< 0. 05) or ∼ 80 % (P< 0. 001) less inhibitory than DOX, respectively. The negative <b>inotropism</b> of 30 [*]–[*] 100 [*]μM DOX, EPI, or MEN 10755 correlated with cellular levels of both alcohol metabolites (r= 0. 88, P< 0. 0001) and carbonyl anthracyclines (r= 0. 79, P< 0. 0001). Nonetheless, multiple comparisons showed that alcohol metabolites were ∼ 20 [*]–[*] 40 times more effective than carbonyl anthracyclines in inhibiting contractility. The negative <b>inotropism</b> of MEN 10755 was therefore increased by chemical procedures, like side chain valeryl esterification, that facilitated its uptake and conversion to alcohol metabolite but not its retention in a carbonyl form.

Attention {{to the source}} of this cardioprotection was focused on flavonoids, the non-alcoholic component of the red wine, whose intake inversely correlates with adverse cardiovascular events. We analysed whether two red wine flavonoids, quercetin and myricetin, affect mammalian basal myocardial and coronary function. Methods and results: Quercetin and myricetin effects were evaluated on isolated and Langendorff perfused rat hearts under both basal conditions and a- and b-adrenergic stimulation. The intracellular signalling involved in the effects of these flavonoids was analysed on perfused hearts and by western blotting on cardiac and HUVEC extracts. Quercetin induced biphasic inotropic and lusitropic effects, positive at lower concentrations and negative at higher concentrations. Contrarily, Myricetin elicits coronary dilation, without affecting contractility and relaxation. Simultaneous administration of the two flavonoids only induced vasodilation. Quercetin-elicited positive <b>inotropism</b> and lusitropism depend on b 1 /b 2 -adrenergic receptors and associate with increased intracellular cAMP, while the negative <b>inotropism</b> and lusitropism observed at higher concentrations were a-adrenergic-dependent.

METHODS: Isolated rabbit hearts, subjected to aerobic perfusion, or low-flow ischaemia followed by reperfusion, were treated with two doses of carvedilol, one dose (2. 0 microM) with marked negative inotropic effect due to beta-blockage and the other (0. 1 microM) with no beta-blockage nor negative <b>inotropism.</b> Carvedilol was compared with two doses of propranolol, 1. 0 - without - and 5. 0 microM - with negative inotropic effect. Anti-oxidant activity was measured as the capacity to counteract the occurrence of oxidative stress and myocardium viability as recovery of left ventricular function on reperfusion, membrane damage and energetic status. RESULTS: Carvedilol counteracted the ischemia and reperfusion induced oxidative stress: myocardial content of reduced glutathione, protein and non-protein sulfhydryl groups after ischaemia and particularly after reperfusion, was higher in hearts treated with carvedilol, while the myocardial content of oxidised glutathione was significantly reduced (0. 30 +/- 0. 03 and 0. 21 +/- 0. 02 vs. 0. 39 +/- 0. 03 nmol/mg prot, both P< 0. 01, in 0. 1 and 2. 0 microM). At the same time, carvedilol improved myocardium viability independently from its beta-blocking effect. On the contrary, propranolol maintained viability only at the higher dose, although to a lesser extent than carvedilol. This suggests that the effects of propranolol are dependent on energy saving due to negative <b>inotropism.</b> The extra-protection observed with carvedilol at both doses is likely due to its anti-oxidant effect.

The mean peak tension developed by the tissue was unaltered by stimulus sequence, provided the mean stimulatory frequency (2 or 5 Hz) was maintained. The instrument {{may be useful to}} study the effect of different stimulatory patterns on cardiac <b>inotropism,</b> as well as for controlling the electrical stimulation of other biological preparations...|$|E
40|$|Positive {{effects of}} steroid hormones and their antagonists on cardiac tissue in mammals are well known. For example, Valencia et al. (1989) {{demonstrated}} positive <b>inotropism</b> in rat atrium after addition of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone; this effect {{was blocked by}} antiandrogens. However, the acute effects of steroids in teleost cardiac tissue have not been studied. The goal {{of this research was}} to investigate the effects of steroids on contractile performance of cardiac tissue from rainbow trout. We also tested whether steroid effects involve activation of transcription or protein synthesis. Experimental Animals Immature male and female (251 ± 9 g; 27. 2 ± 3. 4 cm) and sexually mature male (1216 ± 348 g; 44. 2 ± 4. 2 cm) rainbow trout were obtained from Clear Spring...|$|E
40|$|Mexiletine {{is a very}} {{well-known}} class IB antiarrhythmic drug, whose enantiomers {{differ in}} both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, the (R) -isomer being the eutomer on experimental arrhythmias and in binding studies on cardiac voltage-gated sodium channels. meta-Hydroxymexiletine (MHM) is a minor metabolite of mexiletine, which has demonstrated to be more potent than the parent compound. Herein we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of MHM enantiomers for their potential antiarrhythmic activity. The same stereoselectivity pattern observed for mexiletine was found for MHM: the (R) -enantiomer of MHM was the eutomer on ac-arrhythmia also showing a negative <b>inotropism</b> higher than the one displayed by mexiletine and, at the same time, a decreased vasorelaxant activity on guinea-pig left atrium and guinea-pig ileum longitudinal smooth muscle...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} from both mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates supports {{a role for}} paracrine modulation of myocardial function by the endocardial endothelium (EE) cells. Like the secretory function of the vascular endothelium, this role involves the release of cardioactive factors such as nitric oxide (NO), endothelin- 1, atrial natriuretic peptides, prostanoids {{and a number of}} other substances that have been well characterised in bioassay studies. Endothelial cells also possess enzymatic activities, in particular ACE/kininase activity, which can alter local levels of angiotensin II and bradykinin. Using isolated working heart preparations of teleosts (Imbrogno et al., 2001; Gattuso et al., 2002) and amphibians (Sys et al., 1997) previously set up in our lab, we have explored the role of the EE as a source of cardioactive substances and as a sensor of luminal blood flow-related mechanical and chemical stimuli. To analyse the specific autocrine role of the EE without the confounding effects of the vascular endothelium, we used as a natural model juvenile eel (fresh water Anguilla anguilla) hearts in which the compact ventricular layer and the coronary circulation are poorly developed. We found that under basal conditions the EE produces NO in amounts sufficient to exert a negative <b>inotropism</b> on the myocardium via a cGMP-dependent mechanism. The NO signal is abrogated by the functional damage of the EE, indicating that EE transduces mechanical stimulation into NO release. The EE mediates via a NO-cGMP pathway the positive <b>inotropism</b> elicited by luminal 25 26 cholinergic stimuli, hence partecipating in the ventricular fine-tuning of the molecular signalling cascade downstream from the stimulation of the cardiac muscarinic receptors (Imbrogno et al., 2001). Moreover, the functional integrity of the EE is a prerequisite for mediating intracavitary Angiotensin II-mediated inotropic signals, since these are abolished by functional damage of the EE b...|$|E
40|$|S-nitrosylation {{of several}} Ca 2 + {{regulating}} proteins {{in response to}} β-adrenergic stimulation was recently described in the heart; however the specific nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoform and signaling pathways responsible for this modification have not been elucidated. NOS- 1 activity increases <b>inotropism,</b> therefore, we tested whether β-adrenergic stimulation induces NOS- 1 -dependent S-nitrosylation of total proteins, the ryanodine receptor (RyR 2), SERCA 2 and the L-Type Ca 2 + channel (LTCC). In the isolated rat heart, isoproterenol (10 nM, 3 -min) increased S-nitrosylation of total cardiac proteins (+ 46 ± 14 %) and RyR 2 (+ 146 ± 77 %), without affecting S-nitrosylation of SERCA 2 and LTCC. Selective NOS- 1 blockade with S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline (SMTC) and Nω-propyl-l-arginine decreased basal contractility and relaxation (- 25 - 30 %) and basal S-nitrosylation of total proteins (- 25 - 60 %), RyR 2, SERCA 2 and LTCC (- 60 - 75 %). NOS- 1 inhibition reduced (- 25 - 40 %) the inotropic response and protein S-nitrosylation induced by isoproterenol, particularly that of RyR 2 (- 85 ± 7 %). Tempol, a superoxide scavenger, mimicked the effects of NOS- 1 inhibition on <b>inotropism</b> and protein S-nitrosylation; whereas selective NOS- 3 inhibitor L-N 5 -(1 -Iminoethyl) ornithine had no effect. Inhibition of NOS- 1 did not affect phospholamban phosphorylation, but reduced its oligomerization. Attenuation of contractility was abolished by PKA blockade and unaffected by guanylate cyclase inhibition. Additionally, in isolated mouse cardiomyocytes, NOS- 1 inhibition or removal reduced the Ca 2 +-transient amplitude and sarcomere shortening induced by isoproterenol or by direct PKA activation. We conclude that 1) normal cardiac performance requires basal NOS- 1 activity and S-nitrosylation of the calcium-cycling machinery; 2) β-adrenergic stimulation induces rapid and reversible NOS- 1 dependent, PKA and ROS-dependent, S-nitrosylation of RyR 2 and other proteins, accounting for about one third of its inotropic effect...|$|E
40|$|Background and aims: The anorexigenic glucagon-like peptide (GLP) - 2 is {{produced}} by intestinal L cells and released in response to food intake. It affects intestinal function involving G-protein-coupled receptors. To verify whether GLP- 2 acts as a cardiac modulator in mammals, we analysed, in the rat heart, the expression of GLP- 2 receptors and the myocardial and coronary responses to GLP- 2. Methods and results: GLP- 2 receptors were detected on ventricular extracts by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) and Western blotting. Cardiac GLP- 2 effects were analysed on Langendorff perfused hearts. Intracellular GLP- 2 signalling was investigated on Langendorff perfused hearts and by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on ventricular extracts. By immunoblotting and Q-RT-PCR, we revealed the expression of ventricular GLP- 2 receptors. Perfusion analyses showed that GLP- 2 induces positive <b>inotropism</b> at low concentration (0. 001 nM), and negative <b>inotropism</b> and lusitropism from 0. 1 nM. It dose-dependently constricts coronaries. The negative effects of GLP- 2 were independent from GLP- 1 receptors, being unaffected by exendin- 3 (9 - 39) amide. GLP- 2 -dependent negative action involves Gi/o proteins, associates with a reduction of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), an increase in extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK 1 / 2) {{and a decrease in}} phospholamban phosphorylation, but is independent from endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and protein kinase G (PKG). Finally, GLP- 2 competitively antagonised b-adrenergic stimulation. Conclusions: For the first time, to our knowledge, we found that: (1) the rat heart expresses functional GLP- 2 receptors; (2) GLP- 2 acts on both myocardium and coronaries, negatively modulating both basal and b-adrenergic stimulated cardiac performance; and (3) GLP- 2 effects are mediated by G-proteins and involve ERK 1 / 2...|$|E

S 1319, like isoprenaline, salbutamol and formoterol, relaxed preparations of guinea-pig trachea (contracted by histamine) in a concentration-dependent manner. The relaxing activity of S 1319 appeared to be more potent than that of isoprenaline and salbutamol, and similar to that of formoterol (pD 2 values of 10. 58 ± 0. 03 vs 7. 60 ± 0. 01, 7. 50 ± 0. 01 and 10. 52 ± 0. 04, respectively), and was blocked by the β 2 -adrenoceptor selective antagonist (ICI 118, 551). The intrinsic activity of S 1319 was close to 1. 0. In the β 1 -adrenoceptor containing preparations, guinea-pig right and left atria, a monophasic inotropic response of S 1319 was observed. The pD 2 value of S 1319 for left atrial and right atrial <b>inotropism</b> was 6. 70 ± 0. 15 and 7. 81 ± 0. 01, respectively. The selectivity ratio (trachea/left atrial <b>inotropism)</b> of S 1319, formoterol, salbutamol and isoprenaline was 8523, 284, 4. 8 and 0. 45, respectively. The relative selectivity ratio of S 1319 was 18743, 1858 and 30 times greater than that of isoprenaline, salbutamol and formoterol, respectively. Relaxant responses of guinea-pig trachea to S 1319 declined rapidly when the agonist was washed from the tissues, with complete recovery within 30 [*]min. The duration of action of S 1319 was similar to that of isoprenaline and less than that of salbutamol and formoterol. In summary, S 1319, a sponge-derived β-adrenoceptor agonist, is a potent and selective β 2 -adrenoceptor agonist with a short-duration of action in isolated guinea-pig tracheas...|$|E
