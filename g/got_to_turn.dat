25|$|The Bigfoot {{researchers}} {{say that no}} human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first. You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E

50|$|In mid-2004, Selenium Remote Control (RC) was {{released}} as open source, {{and used a}} Comet technique in the browser to pick up requests from a commanding remote process (tests written in Java, Python, C# or Ruby). The browser would send the last result to a command, {{and pick up the}} next command in the same TCP/IP request. If there were no further command yet it would wait until there was one before replying. This was as close as the Selenium-RC team <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> the browser into a socket listener. Selenium2 (WebDriver) implemented a true socket listener for each browser, so the Comet code and technique isn't used any more.|$|R
60|$|The girl heeded {{not these}} words, but kept on her way. When she <b>got</b> <b>to</b> a <b>turn</b> in the road, however, {{she looked back}} mournfully, as though in doubt whether to return and cast herself upon his breast, and bid him trust in her; but pride overcame her, and she {{resisted}} the impulse.|$|R

50|$|After {{hearing the}} song and {{thinking}} {{it would be a}} good Gospel song, country singer Dolly Parton called Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora and <b>got</b> permission <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the song into a Gospel tune for her 2014 album, Blue Smoke. Dolly and Richie performed this cover at Glastonbury on 29 June 2014.|$|R

They {{had been}} long marching in the rainy season, by bad roads--no roads at all, in short--and when they <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Calcutta, men <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> and drank, before taking {{a last look at}} it. Soldier-like.' ...|$|R
5000|$|There's no dirty {{politics}} in my campaign. But {{let me tell}} you something about dirty politics. It was Len's team that <b>got</b> the media <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> onto me. That's dirty politics to me.|$|R

60|$|Some {{brushwood}} {{was gathered}} and a fire started, {{and the horses}} were tethered near by. The old miner knew {{where there was a}} spring of drinkable water--something occasionally hard to find in a district full of all sorts of minerals--and soon they had some boiling for coffee. Then their outfit was unstrapped, and they prepared supper and <b>got</b> ready <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> in for the night.|$|R
50|$|Jeremy soon pretended he {{was under}} mind control and pretended to resist as he took a knife and stabbed Mr. Terrific in the back. When the JSA interrogated him, he lied, saying he did not {{remember}} anything. He <b>got</b> them <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> their accusations toward King Chimera as he made up questions about King's power {{and as soon as}} they heard Jeremy pretending to resist on their security tape, unbeknownst to them.|$|R
60|$|Gradually {{a little}} log house grew into shape, and Leland, who drove the sleigh round {{to the back}} of it before he <b>got</b> out, <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the man who had slouched from the doorway.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nor have I. What {{can we do}} but pity each other, and {{swear that}} we will be friends,--dear friends. There is the oak-tree and I have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> back. We have said {{everything}} that we can say,--unless you will tell me that you will be my brother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{get ahead}} of that bloomin' detective if I have to set up all night! You can count on my bein' right here at daylight, an' that's the best anybody can do. You ought to get to bed, Seth, 'cause you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> out pretty early in the mornin'." ...|$|E

6000|$|She was {{a brand-new}} bride, innocent, girlish, happy in {{herself and her}} grave and {{worshiping}} stripling of a husband; she was about eighteen, just out of school, free from affectations, unconscious of that passionless multitude around her; and {{the very first time}} she smote that old wreck one recognized that it had met its destiny.

6000|$|... "Not that I {{love the}} sea," [...] bitterly; [...] "but I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> a few honest dollars somehow, and this seemed the likeliest way.

6000|$|... 'Gives a man prestige, you know. No need to dig. I mean {{to have a}} gay old time, and be a [...] "howling swell", if I choose.

40|$|Seminated from an {{industry}} need in Flanders {{of how to}} introduce sustainability in the R&D portfolio decision process, we observed that particular decision support issues came back time after time.

This paper covers the industrial problem setting and possible solution to incorporate sustainability in R&D portfolio decision making.

50|$|Eventually the City of North Miami {{received}} {{title to}} 350 acre in 1970 {{and two years}} later signed a lease with Munisport Inc. to create a recreational facility.

6000|$|... "Yes, you do," [...] {{said the}} Gazeka shrilly. [...] "You {{think the whole}} frightful place belongs to you. You go siding about as if you'd bought it. Just because you've got your second, {{you think you can}} do what you like; turn up or not, as you please. It doesn't matter whether I'm only in the third and you're in the first.

60|$|ASHER (turning). Perhaps I {{said more}} than I meant to, Bert. I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> out these {{machines}} in order that our soldiers may have shrapnel to fight with, and what with enlistments and the determination of unscrupulous workmen {{to take advantage of}} the situation, I'm pretty hard pressed. I can't very well spare steady young men like you, who have too much sense and too much patriotism to mix yourselves up with trouble makers. But I, too, can understand your feeling,--I'd like to be going myself. You might have consulted me, but your place will be ready for you when you come back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, {{we may be}} in {{the wrong}} as to that, but if we ain't, how'll you live?

50|$|The Holly Farms 400 of 1988 {{was a rough}} race. Ricky Rudd led 154 laps, and Dale Earnhardt led 107.
