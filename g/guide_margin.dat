Organ motion that occurs during the delivery of radiation therapy is referred to as intrafraction organ motion. Intrafraction motion is most predominant in the lungs due to the respiratory motion of the diaphragm and lungs. This intrafraction motion presents a substantial challenge to physicists and clinicians interested in the accurate prescription and delivery of a dose in radiation treatment. The convolution model of target motion described in this work was used {{to assess the impact of}} respiratory motion on the delivered dose distribution. This model predicts the dose distribution that will be delivered in the presence of motion by performing a mathematical convolution between the planned dose distribution and a probability distribution describing the target motion. The model was modified from its original form to include the gradient of the probability density function, which provides additional insight into the effect of target motion. The validity of the convolution model in the context of intrafraction motion was established based on an analysis of the model assumptions as well as experimental validation of the model predictions using radiochromic film measurements. It is shown that the model makes useful predictions for a wide range of regular and irregular breathing patterns. Breathing trace recordings acquired during four dimensional computed tomography scans of $ 502 $ unique patients were used in conjunction with the convolution model to simulate the effect of target motion using MATLAB code developed in house. The motion effect on dose coverage was simulated for each breathing trace on a range of target sizes in order to establish trends which can be used to <b>guide</b> <b>margin</b> selection. The required margins were found to have a clear dependence on the standard deviation of the probability distribution describing the target motion. A method for calculating the margin required to maintain target dose coverage is presented. A table of margin recommendations for a range of breathing patterns and target sizes is presented. The effect of motion was also simulated on clinical treatment plans including a 3 -field, a 4 -field and a volumetric modulated arc treatment. The clinical treatment plans demonstrate the interplay between the static dose gradients seen in a clinical setting and the loss of dose coverage due to breathing motion. The validity of the technique is demonstrated for an extreme case of a small lung target undergoing large amplitude motion. This result represents the full use of the proposed methodology. The process demonstrates that using the margins recommended in this work will ensure target dose coverage, but that compromises will be made relative to the plan with unmodified margins. The target dose coverage comes at the expense of increased target volume and potentially increased dose to nearby organs at risk. An analytical approximation of lung target motion and static dose distributions using Gaussian functions is used to demonstrate the limit of the technique for small fields and the sensitivity of the model to its key parameters...|$|E
50|$|Optical margin {{alignment}} outdents letters like A, V, W, Y, and punctuation {{into the}} margins to align the text border optically. Some users remark {{that it makes}} the text margin look crooked, but this is because text frames or <b>margin</b> <b>guides</b> are visible. If text frames are not visible, e.g. in print preview, or when printed, {{the edge of a}} block of text looks more even if optical margin alignment is enabled.|$|R
40|$|The magmatic differentiates emplaced late in volcanotectonic cycles (which when highly evolved {{commonly}} {{occur as}} domes, flow-dome complexes, and shallow intrusive porphyries) are typically more silicic and felsic than their earlier counterparts and exhibit unusually steep spectral curves from about 1. 5 to 2. 2 microns. This spectral characteristic emerges {{in the form}} of relatively high Landsat TM band 7 DN values and low 5 / 7 values, as well as dark-contrast or enhanced 5 / 7 images. These evolved late-phase differentiates are commonly associated both temporally and spatially with precious metal deposits, furnishing site-specific exploration targets as well as <b>guides</b> to caldera <b>margins</b> and other late-stage volcanotectonic structures...|$|R
5000|$|When the Eastern Colored League {{was formed}} in 1923, Ed Bolden hired Lloyd to manage the Hilldale Club. Lloyd brought home the first ECL pennant by a wide <b>margin,</b> <b>guiding</b> Hilldale to a 32-17 league record. He did not get along with Bolden and was {{suspended}} in early September and fired {{at the end of}} the season. In 1924, Lloyd returned to the Bacharachs, now based again in Atlantic City. With the brilliant young shortstop Dick Lundy on the roster, the 40-year-old Lloyd moved himself to second base. He hit [...]444 to win the 1924 ECL batting title, at one point reeling off 11 straight base hits. The Bacharachs, however, were merely average under Lloyd during his two years there, finishing fourth both seasons (with records of 30-29 and 26-27).|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} part of this description is Tov’s theory on the Qumran scribes. Since 1986, Tov has suggested the division of the Qumran scrolls into two groups distinguished by external features. Group 1 is written in a special spelling (forms like ki’), specials linguistic forms (like malkehemah, me’odah), and special scribal habits (writing the divine name in the old Hebrew script, erasing elements with lines and writing cancellation dots above and below words and letters, writing dots in the <b>margins</b> <b>guiding</b> the drawing of the lines, etc.). The great majority of the Qumran sectarian scrolls belong to this group; hence Tov’s suggestion that these scrolls were written by sectarian scribes, possibly at Qumran. These scribes copied biblical as well as extra-biblical scrolls, altogether one-third of the Qumran scrolls, while the other scrolls (group 2) were brought to Qumran from outside, from one or more localities.|$|R
40|$|Randomised {{controlled}} trials (RCTs) {{which involve}} cost-effectiveness evaluations rarely use health economic input when undertaking sample size calculations {{for the trial}} design; however, in studies undertaken with cost-effectiveness as the primary outcome, sample size calculations should be {{directly related to the}} cost-effectiveness result rather than to the effectiveness outcome alone. This paper reports on a case in which a clinical trial design sample size and power calculations were determined with regard to cost-effectiveness using the net monetary benefit (NMB) approach to demonstrate the feasibility of sample size calculation for cost-effectiveness in a real life setting. The proposed RCT of fetal fibronectin screening (fFN) for women with threatened pre-term labour is discussed, followed by the design of a preliminary model to inform the trial design calculation. The predictions from this pre-trial indicate potential cost-savings, but with a marginal detrimental impact on the effectiveness endpoint, neonatal morbidity. The NMB approach for cost-effectiveness is discussed and used to calculate the required sample sizes for different powers. The sample size calculations are then recalculated using a non-inferiority margin, to ensure that the NMB sample size for the trial was also sufficient to demonstrate non-inferiority for the effectiveness endpoint. Finally, a probabilistic analysis explored uncertainty in the model parameters and the impact on sample size. Considerations of economic assessments alongside clinical trials can and should be used to guide conventional trial design. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of such calculations, whilst simultaneously highlighting limitations and demonstrating the role for economic considerations to <b>guide</b> non-inferiority <b>margins...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Wall {{climbing}} robots using {{negative pressure}} suction always employ air pumps which have great noise and large volume. Two prototypes of bio-inspired miniature suction cup actuated by {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) are designed based on studying characteristics of biologic suction apparatuses, and the suction cups in this paper {{can be used as}} adhesion mechanisms for miniature wall climbing robots without air pumps. The first prototype with a two-way shape memory effect (TWSME) extension TiNi spring imitates the piston structure of the stalked sucker; the second one actuated by a one way SMA actuator with a bias has a basic structure of stiff <b>margin,</b> <b>guiding</b> element, leader and elastic element. Analytical model of the second prototype is founded considering the constitutive model of the SMA actuator, the deflection of the thin elastic plate under compound load and the thermo-dynamic model of the sealed air cavity. Experiments are done to test their suction characteristics, and the analytical model of the second prototype is simulated on Matlab/simulink platform and validated by experiments...|$|R
40|$|Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is an {{uncommon}} cutaneous tumour which rarely metastasises. However, local recurrence following apparently adequate surgical excision is well recognised, presumably {{as a result}} of sub-clinical contiguous growth, for which micrographically controlled excision would be a logical treatment. A retrospective study of all patients treated by micrographic surgery, from April 1995 –March 2000, at a tertiary skin oncology centre. Twenty-one patients (11 males), age 14 to 71 years with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans on the trunk (10 patients), groin (four), head and neck (four), and limbs (three) were treated. In 15 patients one micrographic layer cleared the tumour, and four were cleared with two layers. For one patient the second stage was completed by conventional excision <b>guided</b> by positive <b>margins.</b> Another patient with a multiply recurrent perineal dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, not cleared in one area after two layers, died from a pulmonary embolus before total clearance could be achieved. There was no correlation between tumour size and lateral excision margin. No recurrence was observed during the follow-up, from 21 to 80 months, median 47 months. The study provides further support for micrographic surgery as the treatment of choice for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Ameloblastoma is {{a locally}} {{aggressive}} odontogenic neoplasm. With local recurrence rates reaching 90 %, only completeness of excision can facilitate cure. Surgical clearance has widely {{been based on}} pre-operative imaging to <b>guide</b> operative excision <b>margins,</b> however use of intra-operative specimen x-ray or frozen-section has been sought to improve clearance rates, and advanced imaging technologies in this role have been proposed. This manuscript aims to quantify the evidence for evaluating intra-operative resection margins and present the current standard in this role. METHOD: The current study comprises the first reported comparison of imaging modalities for assessing ameloblastoma margins. A case is presented in which margins are assessed with each of clinical assessment based on preoperative imaging, intra-operative specimen x-ray, intra-operative specimen computed tomography (CT) and definitive histology. Each modality is compared quantitatively. These results are compared to the literature through means of systematic review of current evidence. RESULTS: A comparative study highlights the role for CT imaging over plain radiography. With no other comparative studies and a paucity of high level evidence establishing a role for intra-operative margin assessment in ameloblastoma in the literature, only level 4 evidence supporting the use of frozen section and specimen x-ray, and only one level 4 study assesses intra-operative CT. CONCLUSION: The current study suggests that intra-operative specimen CT offers an improvement over existing techniques in this role. While establishing a gold-standard will require higher level comparative studies, the use of intra-operative CT can facilitate accurate single-stage resection...|$|R
40|$|Objecves: Bone tumor oen {{requires}} a surgical resecon of the tumor. Some tools {{have been developed}} to assist the surgeon during the pre-operave and intra-operave steps. The planning leads to accurately define the extension of the tumor, plan resecon trajectories (including a safe margin) and select an opmal allogra (if required). The transfer into the operave room has been achieved using a specifically modified navigaon system. Since few months, paent-specific devices have came up to guide the saw blade during bone cungs, such as total knee arthroplasty. This technology has been transposed to resect bone tumors. An experimental study has been led on sawbones to assess the accuracy of the method and compare the results with the one of a previous experiment using convenonal and navigated methods. We present the preliminary results of this new experiment and some clinical cases that have already benefited from the technique. Materials and methods: The pre-operave planning consists in localizing the tumor, posioning cung planes around the tumor adding a user-defined safe margin, and, if required, selecng an allogra. Once these steps have been achieved, paent-specific guides are built using a Computer Assisted Design soware (CAD). The surgeon checks whether their shape is consistent with the surgical approach and the available bone surface. A rapid prototyping machine is used to manufacture the devices. During the surgery, the guide is posioned onto the bone surface and temporarily fixed using K-Wire. These stages have been used to perform a virtual tumor resecon located on a pelvic sawbone. Specific guides have been manufactured, and provided to operators who were asked to resect the bone tumor. The safe margin and the posion of the cung plane (locaon; ISO standard for evaluang the error between two planes) have been used to quanfy the accuracy of the method. Six bone tumors have already been resected using this technique. An addional guide is also provided when an allogra is used, to opmally adjust the allogra Results: To date, the accuracy of the resecon using the specific guide is excellent. The obtained safe margin is very closed to the target 10 millimeters (average error of 0. 63 millimeters). The error between target and actual planes (e. g. locaon) is 1. 34 millimeters. The clinical cases have systemacally shown a tumor-free resecon. The reconstrucons using an allogra have shown an excellent contact at osteotomy sites, and thus a sasfying reconstrucon of the anatomy. Conclusions: The experiment has shown that paent-specific guides can be trusted for bone tumor resecons. They provide a high accuracy and a high repeatability of osteotomies. Clinical cases has proven the feasibility of the technique and shown some advantages. They are quick and straighorward to use, no addional material is required, biomaterial is cerfied for clinical use. Pre-operaveley, the surgeon has to provide some guidelines to the engineer for creang smart <b>guides</b> (desired safe <b>margin,</b> diameter of K-Wires, available bone surface, saw blade thickness). He receives them ready to be sterilized and used during the surgery. We think this technique has a high added value and is very promising for surgical oncology...|$|R
