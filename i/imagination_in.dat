5|$|The prologue to {{the novel}} is Carpentier’s most often quoted text, in which he coins the term lo real maravilloso ("marvellous reality") in {{reference}} to seemingly miraculous occurrences in Latin America. This is contrasted {{with the lack of}} magic and <b>imagination</b> <b>in</b> European folklore. Furthermore, his trip to Haiti in 1943 is recounted, {{as well as some of}} the research he did to gather facts for the novel. Carpentier also denounces the commonplace and formulaic instances of the marvellous that is found in surrealist novels due to its inorganic and false origins, as opposed to the natural magic that is found in Latin America.|$|E

60|$|It is {{a curious}} {{omission}} on Hume's part that, while thus dwelling on two classes of ideas, Memories and Imaginations, he has not, at the same time, taken notice of a third group, of no small importance, which are as different from imaginations as memories are; though, like the latter, they are often confounded with pure <b>imaginations</b> <b>in</b> general speech.

40|$|On the {{occasion}} of the 130 th anniversary of the birth of Pavel Florensky, the aim {{of this article is to}} analyse the connection between Florensky’s mathematical approach to the physical space <b>in</b> the book <b>Imaginations</b> <b>in</b> Geometry and his influence on new theories of the space of the icon. The 19 th and early 20 th centuries witnessed a revolution in mathematics through the development of non-Euclidean geometry and the fourth dimension, which Florensky interpreted as rehabilitation of the philosophy of the Middle Ages. <b>In</b> <b>Imaginations</b> <b>in</b> Geometry he conceptualized a «Ptolemeic–Dantic view of the world» where by means of the Special Theory of Relativity he made an exact approach to the physical characteristics of objects in the border between Heaven and Earth. Although Florensky did not introduce any «divine geometry» when it came to the icon, the concurrent art theorist Nikolay Tarabukin was influenced by <b>Imaginations</b> <b>in</b> Geometry. Tarabukin interpreted the so-called «inverse perspective» as a non-Euclidean geometrical visualization of the metaphysical worldview of the Middle Ages that got lost in Europe in the Renaissance, and in Russia under Peter the Great, but is reborn in the 20 th century, inspired by the experiments in mathematics...|$|R
