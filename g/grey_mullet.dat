25|$|In 1977, Hughes-Games {{described}} the first practical marine fish/shellfish/phytoplankton culture, followed by Gordin, et al., in 1981. By 1989, a semi-intensive (1kg fish/m−3) seabream and <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> pond system by the Gulf of Aqaba (Eilat) on the Red Sea supported dense diatom populations, excellent for feeding oysters. Hundreds of kilos {{of fish and}} oysters cultured here were sold. Researchers also quantified the water quality parameters and nutrient budgets in (5kg fish m−3) green water seabream ponds. The phytoplankton generally maintained reasonable water quality and converted on average over half the waste nitrogen into algal biomass. Experiments with intensive bivalve cultures yielded high bivalve growth rates. This technology supported a small farm in southern Israel.|$|E

Stable isotope signatures (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) of the fishes followed a pattern, with enrichments in 13 C and 15 N to increasing length: δ 13 C in fishes 30 mm δ 13 C ranged from - 15. 8 to - 12. 7 ‰, closer to the level in salt marsh food resources. Large differences between the δ 15 N values of mullets and those of food sources (6. 0 ‰ on average) showed that YoY are secondary consumers, like older individuals, when feeding in the salt marsh. YoY mullets shift from browsing on pelagic prey to grazing on benthic resources from the salt marsh before reaching 30 mm in length.

The number and form of pyloric caeca provide additional help in the identification of certain species of mullets. It is suggested that species differing from others of the same genus, by having well developed adipose eyelids, be given a subgeneric status and that end of maxilla be considered as "exposed" when the mouth is closed, only when the "maxillary notch" is closer to the angle of the mouth.

The sizes of over 1500 otter prey were estimated from measurements of key pieces found in 814 otter spraints, which were collected in lower stream stretches in a sandy coastal area.
