5|$|Rachel, who is {{spending}} {{most of her time}} in her hotel room on account of her pregnancy, receives a visit from her expatriated lesbian sister Lucy (Susannah Doyle). Lucy tells Rachel that she has been sleeping around with men {{in order to have a}} child. When Adam learns of this, he suggests to Lucy that she use some of his banked sperm. They broach the idea to Rachel, who is disgusted at the thought of her husband having a baby with her sister and forbids it from going ahead. Meanwhile, Karen finally assures David that the animosity between them caused by his extramarital affair is in the past. She emails Mark Cubitt (Sean Pertwee), a man she has been having an affair with in England, to tell him their fling is over. Mark arrives at her apartment the next morning and spends the day with her after David cancels a visit to an art gallery with her. He convinces her that David <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> insensitive man that he has always been. The next day, Karen tells Rachel that she will leave David to be with Mark.|$|E
5|$|E.V.O.: Search for Eden is a side-scrolling {{platformer}} action {{game where}} players must navigate {{a creature of}} their own design across a number of environments resembling Earth's past. The game is divided into five distinct geological periods: the Cambrian Period and the Ordovician Period of the Paleozoic Era ("The World Before Land") from 500 million years ago to 450 million years ago, then the Carboniferous period ("Early Creatures of Land"), the Mesozoic Era ("Age of Dinosaurs"), the late Neogene period ("Ice Age"), and finally the early Quaternary period ("Early Man"). Each period has its own map screen, which is divided into various levels. While each era takes historical liberties with both its inhabitants and time frames, the player's choices for evolution are dependent on the current era of play, ranging from aquatic bodies during the Age of Fish to mammalian physiology during the Age of Man. During the first two eras you are forced to gain a new body to progress, but once you reach the Age of Dinosaurs, a side quest {{will give you the}} option to remain as a reptile, or become a bird, gaining the ability of flight. As you enter the Ice Age as a bird or reptile, you are immediately given the option to become a mammal. You can finish the game as a reptile, bird, or mammal and the outcome <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> only the interaction dialogue is affected by your choices.|$|E

25|$|To {{make the}} PSP slimmer, the {{capacity}} of the battery was reduced by 1/3. However, due to more efficient power usage, the run time of the PSP <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the previous model. Older model batteries will work which extends the amount of playing time. However, the battery cover on the newer model does not fit over the older battery due to its bulkier size. The batteries take about one and a half hour to charge and last roughly 4.5–7 hours depending on factors such as screen brightness settings, WLAN and volume levels.|$|E
25|$|The Zonda R Evolución is {{an updated}} version of the Zonda R. It {{features}} many changes over the previous Zonda R. Also the car takes many pieces and inspirations from the Zonda 760RS. It is finished in pearl white with exposed carbon-fibre on the nose. The 6.0L V12 engine is uprated to 800PS. The body work <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> but has improved aerodynamics. It features a bigger air splitter above the two standard air splitters on the front bumper and a pair of small splitters {{on the sides of the}} rear bumper. A bigger rear central fin— even bigger than the 760 series Zondas— and a small spoiler added below the standard Zonda R spoiler improves aerodynamics and increases down-force.|$|E
25|$|Another problem {{commonly}} {{faced by}} narrow-gauge railways {{was that they}} lack the physical space to grow: their cheap construction meant they were engineered only for their initial traffic demands. While a standard or broad gauge railway can be more easily be upgraded to handle heavier, faster traffic, many narrow-gauge railways were impractical to improve. Speeds and loads hauled could not increase, so traffic density was significantly limited. In the case of Queensland, Australia, the Queensland Rail passenger network has nearly reached its capacity due to the narrow gauge and an ever-increasing population, as such, new lines are to be built, thus negating the original cost savings. In Japan, a few narrow gauge lines have been upgraded to standard gauge mini-shinkansen to allow through service by standard gauge high-speed vehicles, but due to the alignment of those lines and minimum curve radius of those lines, the maximum speed of those through service <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the original narrow-gauge rail line.|$|E

25|$|Kǎishū style (traditional regular script) — {{still in}} use today — and {{attributed}} to Wang Xizhi (王羲之, 303-361) and his followers, is even more regularized. Its spread was encouraged by Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang (926-933), who ordered the printing of the classics using new wooden blocks in Kaishu. Printing technologies here allowed shapes to stabilize. The Kaishu shape of characters 1000 years ago was mostly similar to {{that at the end}} of Imperial China. But small changes have been made, for example in the shape of 广 which is not absolutely the same in the Kangxi Dictionary of 1716 as in modern books. The Kangxi and current shapes have tiny differences, while stroke order <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> according to old style., 厂 or 广, p.41. The 2007 common shape for those characters does not clearly show the stroke order, but old versions, visible on the Kangxi Zidian p.41 clearly allow the stroke order to be determined.|$|E
25|$|After Hazumu's {{transformation}} into a girl, Asuta suddenly finds {{his good friend}} Hazumu very attractive, and cannot help himself when he starts thinking about Hazumu in a sexual way. During the time when Hazumu and her friends go to the beach, Asuta continuously tries to remind himself that even though Hazumu's body has changed, the person <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> and as her best friend, {{he should not be}} thinking about her in a sexual way. Hazumu remains oblivious to the fact throughout the series that Asuta has been often thinking about her in a sexual way. Asuta continues to have fantasies about having Hazumu as a girlfriend as well. Overtime, Asuta realizes that Hazumu and him gradually grow apart from each other, or are at least not as close as they once had been when Hazumu was a boy. He does find it excellent that his friend is now a very attractive girl, but only wants to continue being Hazumu's friend and nothing more, constantly beating himself up for having impure thoughts about Hazumu. In the last pages of the manga, he announces to the others that he has found a girlfriend, and shows them a photograph of her. They remark that she looks a lot like Hazumu.|$|E

Regarding his similarity to his character, {{he said he}} is [...] "hopefully very different but maybe at the root of it we're the same person. I'm probably a little smarter than the character though. Maybe the things that he thinks I also think but I'm able to suppress them." ...|$|E

500|$|Strictly speaking, {{replacing}} a component {{with one of}} an entirely different type <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> topology. [...] In some contexts, however, these can loosely be described as different topologies. [...] For instance, interchanging inductors and capacitors in a low-pass filter results in a high-pass filter. [...] These {{might be described as}} high-pass and low-pass topologies even though the network topology is identical. [...] A more correct term for these classes of object (that is, a network where the type of component is specified but not the absolute value) is prototype network.|$|E
500|$|Some tax protesters {{have cited}} the U.S. Supreme Court {{decision}} {{in the case of}} Eisner v. Macomber for the theory that wages are not taxable, or for the theory that dividends are not taxable. The case dealt with a stock dividend on stock that was essentially equivalent to a stock split, as opposed to a cash dividend on stock. In the case of this kind of [...] "dividend" [...] the stockholder does not receive anything or realize any additional value. For example, if a stockholder owns 100 shares of stock having a value of $4 per share, the total value is $400. If the corporation declares, say, a [...] "two for one" [...] stock dividend that is essentially similar to a stock split (and the corporation distributes no money or other property), the stockholder now has 200 shares with a value of $2 each, which is still $400 in value - i.e., no increase in value and no income. The pie <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> size [...] but it's sliced into more pieces, each piece being proportionately smaller.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the death}} of Dr. Jordan Kenley (John Sloman), Chief Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) replaces his head of {{pediatric}} surgery with Dr. Arizona Robbins, {{a graduate of the}} Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Robbins has a romantic interest in orthopedic 5 year resident Callie Torres, (Sara Ramirez) later goes on to kiss her. The two embark on a relationship, but when Torres' father, Carlos (Héctor Elizondo), learns of the relationship, he threatens to cut her off financially unless she returns home with him. When Torres' father returns to Seattle and continues to reject his daughter's Human female sexuality, Robbins is able to convince him to reconsider. She tells Mr. Torres that her father was able to accept her own sexuality, as she promised him she was still the [...] "good man in a storm" [...] he raised her to be, and that Torres <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> person he raised. Torres is dismayed to learn that Robbins doesn't want children, and the two come to a conclusion that they cannot continue their relationship, since they both want different things. However, after a shooter enters Seattle Grace with a vendetta for Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), and Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), they are in lockdown together, and the two reconcile.|$|E

500|$|To put {{it another}} way, a thing or person is often seen as having a [...] "defining essence" [...] or a [...] "core identity" [...] that is unchanging, and {{describes}} what the thing or person really is. In this way of thinking, things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time, with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity (e.g. [...] "Mark's hair has turned gray as he has gotten older, but he <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> person"). But in Whitehead's cosmology, the only fundamentally existent things are discrete [...] "occasions of experience" [...] that overlap one another in time and space, and jointly make up the enduring person or thing. On the other hand, what ordinary thinking often regards as [...] "the essence of a thing" [...] or [...] "the identity/core of a person" [...] is an abstract generalization of what is regarded as that person or thing's most important or salient features across time. [...] Identities do not define people, people define identities. [...] Everything changes from moment to moment, and to think of anything as having an [...] "enduring essence" [...] misses the fact that [...] "all things flow", though it is often a useful way of speaking.|$|E
500|$|Farber further said {{he found}} {{similarities}} between the songs on The Open Door and the works of Mariah Carey, Sarah Brightman, Nickelback and Annie Haslam. The Sydney Morning Herald felt [...] "the band's symphonic metal tunes and dark-hearted lyrics are gloomier than ever". Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times called the album [...] "too pop for some and too hard for others", while describing the lyrics as [...] "youthfully earnest and sometimes obvious". In his review of The Open Door, Jon Dolan of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "The music <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> crush of chunka-chunka riffs, moody electronic churn, and Valhalla-bound metal slam, all in service of Lee's strikingly operatic singing". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe said the songs on the album {{are similar to the}} band's [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] (2003) and [...] "Going Under" [...] (2003), with the [...] "mix of Lee's ethereal soprano, piano interludes, and layers of serrated guitar crunch that conjure visions of Sarah McLachlan fronting Godsmack". Rolling Stones Rob Sheffield compared Lee's vocals with those of 1980s [...] "shoulder-pad belters" [...] like Pat Benatar and Ann Wilson of Heart. Christianity Todays Andree Farias called the album [...] "an extension of what the band has done before. Industrial backbeats give way to thick metal riffs, orchestrated grandeur, and ghoulish choral elements, all complemented by Lee's operatic soprano". Billboard said Evanescence has [...] "translated [...] heartache into another successful set of melodramatic goth/industrial anthems with touches of prog and even classical [...] ".|$|E
500|$|By October 2013, Marvel was {{preparing}} four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, {{to present to}} video on demand services and cable providers, with Netflix, Amazon, and WGN America expressing interest. In November 2013, {{it was announced that}} Disney would provide Netflix with live-action series based on Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage, leading up to a miniseries based on the Defenders. Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that Netflix was chosen to air the shows, [...] "when Disney realized it could use the streaming service as a way to grow the popularity of the characters". He added that, if the characters prove popular, they could become feature films. Loeb later stated that Marvel was not [...] "interested in making four pilots and then hoping someday that they could all get together. Netflix really understood what it is we wanted to do. They're very open to directors that might not have that same opportunity in broadcast television. The notion of having all 13 episodes at one time, particularly in serialized storytelling, is very appealing." [...] Loeb also added that the four characters chosen [...] "all had a previous existing relationship and all grew up on the same kind of stoop in New York [...] So it lent itself to a world. Does that mean these shows {{are going to be the}} same? No. They can't be. The characters have different issues, different problems, different feelings about them ... the example that I continually give is that I cannot think of two films that are more different in tone than [...] and Guardians of the Galaxy. And yet, if you watch them back to back, they feel very Marvel. They feel very much like, 'Oh, it <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> universe that I'm in.'" ...|$|E
50|$|The songs {{used for}} the game come from the album Not Even Once by the band Approaching Nirvana. Most of the songs are either {{shortened}} or extended mixes of <b>the</b> originals, but <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> song.|$|R
