40|$|The {{dissertation}} aims {{to identify}} and investigate factors involved in direct sale in relation to Chinese culture. Direct sale is one form of direct marketing, which can include door-to-door, office-to-office, <b>home</b> <b>party</b> <b>selling,</b> etc. For a salesperson {{to be able to}} do business with people from various cultures, he/she needs to understand the differences in their values and in their consumer needs. Cultural values have implications for marketing communication and direct selling activities. After a literature review of the two areas, direct sale and Chinese culture a theoretical model was developed. This model will be helpful for companies when entering the Chinese market through direct sale. The model consists of twelve factors involved in direct sale; communication, commitment, trust, collective, friendship, empathy, respect, conflict avoidance, loyalty, functionality, behaviour, and home party. The aim is to show how important each of the factors is for direct selling in China. From the interpretations of the research review we came to the conclusion that all factors are considered to be of importance in relation to Chinese culture. In order to test the model we conducted a survey. Our population consisted of Chinese exchange students at Kristianstad University in Sweden. The result of the survey became the base of a new model. The new model showed that all factors were of importance but with different degrees. In order to see if our model might be useful in real life we chose to include a case study of Oriflame. All the factors in our model supported Oriflame’s strategy...|$|E
50|$|The party plan is {{a method}} of {{marketing}} products by hosting what {{is presented as a}} social event at which products will be offered for sale. It is a form of direct selling. The primary system for generating sales leads for <b>home</b> <b>party</b> plan sales is the <b>home</b> <b>party</b> itself: the salesperson uses the <b>home</b> <b>party</b> business model as a source for future business by asking attendees if they would like to host <b>selling</b> <b>parties,</b> too.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to analyse the {{regulation}} of consumer contracts negotiated away from permanent retail locations and to outline the industry of direct selling in the Czech Republic, the European Union and the United States. The thesis is subdivided into six independent chapters. Chapter One is introductory and defines basic terminology used in the thesis. This Chapter {{is divided into three}} parts. Part One defines direct selling as a channel of distribution for the marketing of products and services directly to consumers. Part Two presents different kinds of direct selling, i. e. door-to-door <b>selling,</b> person-to-person <b>selling,</b> <b>home</b> <b>parties</b> and group <b>selling.</b> Finally Part Three compares direct selling with distance selling. Chapter Two provides an outline of the relevant legal regulation of direct selling. The current legislation in the European level is composed of Directive 85 / 577 /EEC which relates to protection of the consumers in respect of contracts negotiated away from business premises. The Directive has been implemented into Czech legal system {{on the basis of the}} Czech Republic's membership in the European Union. The Directive is provided in Section 57 of Czech Civil Code 40 / 1964 Coll. This Part also looks at the process of the review of the consumer acquis. Chapter Three [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Since the Supreme Court {{decision}} Burlington Northern 2 ̆ 6 Santa Fe Railway Co. v. United States, {{courts have}} wrestled {{with what it}} means to be an arranger under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). One aspect of arranger liability that has undergone radical change in the past decade is the useful product doctrine, which allows a party to escape arranger liability by proving it was selling a useful product rather than arranging for disposal. Prior to Burlington Northern, courts applied the useful product doctrine restrictively, only allowing <b>parties</b> <b>selling</b> virgin products to escape liability and imposing liability on <b>parties</b> <b>selling</b> useful secondary products. Following Burlington Northern, this shifted, with courts requiring concrete evidence of intent in arrangements for disposal and allowing <b>parties</b> <b>selling</b> secondary products to escape liability even when their actions directly contributed to environmental contamination. This Note argues that this shift in the useful product doctrine will negatively impact the Superfund litigation landscape, and more importantly, the environment. This Note also posits that the shift in the useful product doctrine can be correlated to a shift in administrative law, away from deferring to agency decisions and towards a more searching judicial inquiry. This Note argues that the courts should scale back their permissive approach to the useful product doctrine and give greater weight to agency expertise and agency liability determinations when ruling on arranger liability cases in the useful product arena...|$|R
