5000|$|In December 1915, David Lloyd George and Arthur Henderson, leading {{figures in}} the Liberal Party and Labour Party, {{travelled}} to Glasgow to address a meeting of workers at St Andrew's Hall. This was poorly received, particularly by supporters of Maclean, who barracked the speakers. Press accounts of the meeting were officially censored, but two local socialist newspapers, <b>Forward</b> <b>and</b> Maclean's own <b>publication,</b> Vanguard, were either unaware of this or unwilling to co-operate. [...] In response, the government banned the two <b>publications</b> <b>and</b> seized copies of their current issues. On 2 February, The Worker was also banned, {{on the grounds that}} it had printed an article by Maclean entitled [...] "Should the workers arm?", even though the article had concluded that they should not. Police raided the SLP offices where the paper was produced and broke the printing presses, and arrested Maclean, Gallacher, Muir and Walter Bell.|$|R

40|$|How can one explain cross-national {{differences}} in innovative activity across the industrialized democracies? In this article, I examine {{the varieties of}} capitalism (VOC) response to this question. VOC theory predicts that societies with liberal-market economies will direct their inventive activity toward radical technological change, while societies with coordinated-market economies will direct their inventive activity toward incremental technological change. I find that these predictions are {{not supported by the}} empirical data, and that the evidence offered by VOC proponents depends heavily on the inclusion of a major outlier, the United States, in the class of liberal-market economies.

40|$|When {{robot arm}} {{performs}} a motion control, {{it needs to}} calculate a complicated algorithm of <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> inverse kinematics which consumes much CPU time and certainty slows down the motion speed of robot arm. Therefore, to solve this issue, {{the development of a}} hardware realization of <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> inverse kinematics for an articulated robot arm is investigated. In this paper, the formulation of the <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> inverse kinematics for a five-axis articulated robot arm is derived firstly. Then, the computations algorithm and its hardware implementation are described. Further, very high speed integrated circuits hardware description language (VHDL) is applied to describe the overall hardware behavior of <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> inverse kinematics. Additionally, finite state machine (FSM) is applied for reducing the hardware resource usage. Finally, for verifying the correctness of <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> inverse kinematics for the five-axis articulated robot arm, a cosimulation work is constructed by ModelSim and Simulink. The hardware of the <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> inverse kinematics is run by ModelSim and a test bench which generates stimulus to ModelSim and displays the output response is taken in Simulink. Under this design, the <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> inverse kinematics algorithms can be completed within one microsecond...|$|R

2500|$|Another {{theory that}} can be tested using cued recall is {{symmetry}} of <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> backward recall. <b>Forward</b> recall is generally assumed to be easier than backward recall, i.e. forward recall is stronger than backward recall. This is generally true for long sequences of word or letters such as the alphabet. In one view, the independent associations hypothesis, the strength of <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> backward recall are hypothesized to be independent of each other. To confirm this hypothesis, Dr. George Wolford tested participants' <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> backward recall <b>and</b> found that <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> backward recall are independent of each other. The probability of correct forward recall was [...]47 for word pair associations and the probability of correct backward recall of word pair associations was [...]25. However, in another view, the associative symmetry hypothesis, the strengths of <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> backward recall are about equal and highly correlated. In S.E Asch from Swathmore College and S. M Ebenholtz's experiment, participants learned pairs of nonsense syllables by anticipation recall. After reaching a certain threshold of learning, the participants were tested by free recall to determine all pairs and single items they could remember. These researchers found that backward association was greatly weaker than forward association. However, when the availability of <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> backward recall were basically the same, there was little difference between <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> backward recall. Some scientists including Asch and Ebenholtz believe in the independent association hypothesis think that the equal strengths of <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> backward recall are compatible with their hypothesis because <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> backward recall could be independent but with equal strengths. However associative symmetry theorists interpreted the data to mean that the results fit their hypothesis.|$|R
