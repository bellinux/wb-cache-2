40|$|Abstract. The paper divides <b>environmental</b> risk <b>control</b> {{modes of}} {{residential}} projects into four types: static and non-integrated mode, static and integrated mode, dynamic and non-integrated mode, and dynamic and integrated mode. The paper elicits that the dynamic and integrated <b>environmental</b> risk <b>control</b> mode for residential projects {{is better than}} other three kinds of modes by comparing four kinds of dissimilarity modes of <b>environmental</b> risk <b>control</b> system. The Dynamic and Integrated <b>Environmental</b> Risk <b>Control</b> System(DIERCS) for residential projects is established. The establishment of Dynamic and Integrated <b>Environmental</b> Risk <b>Control</b> System(DIERCS) for residential projects is based on dynamic and integrated <b>environmental</b> risk <b>control</b> mode; therefore, it is necessity {{to carry on a}} study to the dynamic and integrated <b>environmental</b> risk <b>control</b> mode of residential projects first from the theory.

The first commercially available dynamic screen speech generating devices were developed in the 1990s. At the same time synthesized speech was becoming available in more languages.

5|$|The {{review board}} {{determined}} that the electrical power momentarily failed at 23:30:55 GMT, and found evidence of several electric arcs in the interior equipment.

5|$|Mirs <b>Environmental</b> <b>Control</b> and Life Support System (ECLSS) {{provided}} or controlled atmospheric pressure, fire detection, oxygen levels, {{waste management}} and water supply. The highest {{priority for the}} ECLSS was the station's atmosphere, but the system also collected, processed, and stored waste and water produced and used by the crew—a process that recycles fluid from the sink, toilet, and condensation from the air. The Elektron system generated oxygen. Bottled oxygen and Solid Fuel Oxygen Generation (SFOG) canisters, a system known as Vika, provided backup. Carbon dioxide {{was removed from the}} air by the Vozdukh system. Other byproducts of human metabolism, such as methane from the intestines and ammonia from sweat, were removed by activated charcoal filters. Similar systems are presently used on the International Space Station.|$|E

5|$|The Command and Service Modules were mated in the KSC {{altitude}} chamber in September, and combined system testing was performed. Altitude testing was performed first unmanned, then {{with both the}} prime and backup crews, from October 10 through December 30. During this testing, the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Control</b> Unit in the Command Module {{was found to have}} a design flaw, and was sent back to the manufacturer for design changes and rework. The returned ECU then leaked water/glycol coolant, and had to be returned a second time. Also during this time, a propellant tank in Service Module 017 had ruptured during testing at NAA, prompting the separation of the modules and removal from the chamber so the Service Module could be tested for signs of the tank problem. These tests were negative.|$|E
5|$|Ford often opposed {{governor}} Mark Sanford's political goals, arguing {{his proposed}} reforms were unwanted by the public, and he mostly opposed Sanford's fiscal policy and worked to override budget vetoes by the governor, claiming he {{was removed from}} the interests of citizens. An exception were security measures for the State House complex which Ford agreed were too costly. He also opposed Sanford's goal {{to increase the number of}} roll calls in the State Senate and voted against a 2008 immigration reform bill favored by Sanford, stating it would be an ineffective deterrent and would lead to less driving safety. The reform would have required all employers to use state driver's licenses or a database from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to check the legal status of workers. Ford co-sponsored a bill with Glenn McConnell that would limit the governor's authority to appoint and remove board members overseeing the Charleston port and increase required qualifications for board members. Ford opposed a bill giving Sanford authority over the South Carolina Department of Health and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Control.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 16 November 2010, an F-22 from Elmendorf Air Force Base crashed, {{killing the}} pilot, Captain Jeffrey Haney. F-22s were {{restricted}} to flying below 25,000 feet, then grounded during the investigation. The crash {{was attributed to}} a bleed air system malfunction after an engine overheat condition was detected, shutting down the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Control</b> System (ECS) and OBOGS. The accident review board ruled Haney was to blame, as he did not react properly and did not engage the emergency oxygen system. Haney's widow sued Lockheed Martin, claiming equipment defects. She later reached a settlement. After the ruling, the engagement handle of the emergency oxygen system was redesigned; the system should engage automatically if OBOGS shuts down due to engine failure. On 11 February 2013, the DoD's Inspector General released a report stating that the USAF had erred in blaming Haney, and that facts did not sufficiently support conclusions; the USAF stated that it stood by the ruling.|$|E

40|$|Energy is a {{vital and}} a decisive factor in any economy. The {{availability}} of energy has {{a great impact on}} the economic and social development. With the continuous increase in price paid for energy, there will be a substantial incentive for effective energy management. Therefore, energy management has to be considered as a core management process in any facility. The emphasis on energy conservation has therefore, to begin at the design stage and continue throughout the life cycle of the building project (design, construction, operation and maintenance). The energy efficiency of a facility can be evaluated by analysing the Passive <b>environmental</b> <b>controls</b> and Active <b>environmental</b> <b>controls.</b> The passive <b>environmental</b> <b>controls</b> are such as building orientation, shape and thermal properties of its envelope. The active <b>environmental</b> <b>controls</b> are such as air-conditioning, lighting, and plant and equipment. This study intends to investigate the measures taken during the design and construction stages with regard to the energy conservation and the operational performances of the high-rise office building projects. It also focus on the energy management processes in practice.
