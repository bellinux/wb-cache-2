500|$|In Latin, {{the middle}} finger was the digitus impudicus, meaning the [...] "shameless, indecent or {{offensive}} finger". In the 1st century AD, Persius had superstitious female relatives concoct a charm with the [...] "infamous finger" [...] (digitus infamis) and [...] "purifying spit"; {{while in the}} Satyricon, an old woman uses dust, spit and her middle finger to mark the forehead before casting a spell. The poet Martial has a character in good health extend [...] "the indecent one" [...] toward three doctors. In another epigram, Martial wrote: [...] "Laugh loud, Sextillus, at whoever calls you a cinaedus and <b>extend</b> <b>your</b> middle finger." [...] Juvenal, through synecdoche, has the [...] "middle nail" [...] cocked at threatening Fortuna. The indecent finger features again in a mocking context in the Priapeia, a collection of poems relating to the phallic god Priapus. In Late Antiquity, the term [...] "shameless finger" [...] is explained in the Etymologiae of Isidore of Seville with reference to its frequent use when accusing someone of a [...] "shameful action".|$|E

2500|$|For {{the rest}} of 1936 and through 1937, Zanuck placed Stuart in movies such as The Girl on the Front Page—Frank S.

[...] In spite of the films' lukewarm reviews, Stuart had amassed a loyal following of fans by this time in her career, one of whom had her portrait tattooed across his chest.

2500|$|While many of O'Brien's {{professional}} advisors {{and managers}} {{pushed for the}} Fox deal, O'Brien's desire to one day perhaps take over The Tonight Show after Leno made it a difficult decision (O'Brien, like many baby-boomer comedians, had grown up idolizing Carson's incarnation). Chernin warned O'Brien that waiting around for Leno to leave would be [...] "only an invitation to long-term disappointment, and potentially a path toward undermining a promising career." [...] Nevertheless, O'Brien signed the deal with NBC in March 2002; the contract extended him through 2005 and most significantly contained an [...] "explicit Prince of Wales clause" [...] that solidified the official line of succession: If anything were to happen to Leno, O'Brien would step in. O'Brien's successful hosting job at the 2002 54th Primetime Emmy Awards [...] "sent out the most resounding message yet about his growing strength as a performer", and a year later, NBC broadcast O'Brien's tenth anniversary special in primetime. By the time Leno's contract again came up for renewal, a discussion would be needed regarding the future of The Tonight Show. Facing the prospect of attempting to keep both Leno and O'Brien, Zucker made the final call on Leno's deal: [...] "Yes, we’ll <b>extend</b> <b>your</b> deal. But this is your last contract. Time {{to hand over the}} keys." [...] The plan would extend Leno four additional years, after which he would give The Tonight Show to O'Brien.|$|E

40|$|The {{starting}} point for <b>Extending</b> <b>Your</b> Use-By Date is that we sometimes head unthinkingly into retirement {{at a time when}} we are living longer than ever and we have developed skills and abilities we can keep on using. The book also argues that continuing to work can maintain our wellbeing as well as contribute to our bank balance. <b>Extending</b> <b>Your</b> Use-By Date draws on the real-life experiences of people who have worked or are working into older life in lots of different ways. We find out how they've made the most of their knowledge, skills and talents as they've grown older, and why they decided to pick up and move that milestone known as 'retirement age'. We also learn what we can expect of our minds and bodies as we get older, and about the current phenomenon of ageing populations and the greying of the workforce, and how these developments could mean new opportunities for older workers.
