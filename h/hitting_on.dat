5|$|Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) talks {{briefly to}} Sen. Lipton about animal rights, and Lipton (who Oscar {{suspects}} is gay) gives Oscar his private cell phone number, asking Oscar {{to call him}} in the evening to discuss issues further. Oscar tells Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that the Senator was <b>hitting</b> <b>on</b> him. Jim says Lipton was likely just schmoozing a voter, talks to Lipton himself, and also gets his number. Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) later gets Lipton's number as well, resulting in Oscar thinking that the senator {{may not have been}} <b>hitting</b> <b>on</b> him. When Oscar is leaving, Lipton shakes his hand and caresses Oscar's arm for long enough that Oscar once again believes Lipton was pursuing him.|$|E

After introducing her new boyfriend, Anthony, to the family, Meg goes on to make out {{with him on the}} family couch, with Lois watching over nearby. Jealous of her daughter's new-found love, she begins <b>hitting</b> <b>on</b> Anthony. Later that day, Lois sends Meg to pick up her grandfather, leaving her all alone with Anthony. The two then begin making out on the couch, but Meg returns to the house only a few moments later and discovers them. Angry at her mother for ruining her chance at having a normal boyfriend, Meg threatens Lois to lay off of him, pulling out one of her own teeth in frustration. Lois quickly agrees, but is still angry with Peter for continually insulting her. She confronts him about this, and he admits that he was actually embarrassed about his own advancing age, as well as his lack of fitness, and was only insulting Lois in order to distract her from the fact that she could be with a much better-looking man. He apologizes for his behavior, and Lois forgives him.|$|E
25|$|Druce was {{a rather}} unorthodox batsman focused chiefly on hitting, and for his day his <b>hitting</b> <b>on</b> the leg-side was {{exceptional}} in quality.

25|$|Fanta's older {{homosexual}} brother, {{and is a}} half-faerie like her. He shows extremely discriminative {{attitude towards}} all females except his sister, presumably because he had traumatic childhood relationship with his cold and distant mother. This also is implied to be the reason his romantic interests lie within males. He and his sister are close, {{even if they do}} argue sometimes like most siblings. Pain is the one who enchanted Ryang's skateboard (after <b>hitting</b> <b>on</b> him) so he could fight the evil affinities along with Fanta. Pain's best friend is Charon, the Prime Minister of Avalon and Medea's brother. Although the full extent of Pain's power is unknown, {{the fact that he has}} attained the position of Royal Inspector, a job which requires both power and precision, as well as being the only character seen so far that is able to hold off evil affinities. Like Fanta, he is much more powerful than the other inhabitants realize; as a child, he was able to detect Seraphina's spells when Charon and others could not. Pain also possesses powers to trace magical energy back to the original performer of magic.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, Martin {{launched}} his weekly NBC comedy-variety series, The Dean Martin Show, which ran for 264 episodes until 1974. He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy in 1966 and was nominated again {{the following three}} years. The show exploited his image as a carefree boozer. Martin capitalized on his laid-back persona of the half-drunk crooner, <b>hitting</b> <b>on</b> women with remarks that would get anyone else slapped, and making snappy if slurred remarks about fellow celebrities during his roasts. During an interview on the British TV documentary Wine, Women and Song, aired in 1983, he stated, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, that he had someone record them on cassette tape so he could listen to them. His TV show was a success. The show's loose format featured quick-witted improvisation from Martin and his weekly guests. This prompted a battle between Martin and NBC censors, who insisted on more scrutiny of the content. The show was often in the Top Ten. Martin, appreciative of the show's producer, his friend Greg Garrison, made a handshake deal giving Garrison, a pioneer TV producer in the 1950s, 50% of the show. However, the validity of that ownership {{is the subject of}} a lawsuit brought by NBCUniversal.|$|E

While being interviewed by Rolling Stone, Kesha was asked about her writing technique and how her songs come to fruition, which she explained using [...] "Dinosaur" [...] as an example.
