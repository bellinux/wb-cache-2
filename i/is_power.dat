Power, for Russell, is one's ability to achieve goals. In particular, Russell has in mind social power, that <b>is,</b> <b>power</b> over people.|$|E
5|$|In chapter nine, Marita's Bargain, Gladwell {{advances}} {{the notion}} that the success of students of different cultures or different socio-economic backgrounds is in fact highly correlated to the time students spent in school or in educationally rich environments. He describes the Knowledge <b>is</b> <b>Power</b> Program (KIPP) which helps students from about 50 inner-city schools across the United States achieve much better results than other inner-city schools' students and explains that their success {{stems from the fact that}} they simply spent more hours at school during the school year and the summer. Gladwell also analyzes a five-year study done by Karl Alexander of Johns Hopkins University, demonstrating that summer holidays have a detrimental effect on students of disadvantaged backgrounds, who paradoxically progress more during the school year than students from the highest socio-economic group.|$|E
5|$|Due to the 1989 {{amendments}} to the Constitution and the ISA, the exercise of the subjectively worded powers in the ISA is not judicially reviewable by the courts, except when {{there has been some}} non-compliance with the procedures set out in the Act. On the other hand, the objective test laid down in Chng Suan Tze continues to be the law governing judicial review of the exercise of executive discretion under subjectively worded provisions in statutes other than the ISA. In Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), the Court of Appeal opined that the 1989 legislative amendments did not completely reverse Chng Suan Tze. Apart from restricting the courts' supervisory jurisdiction to reviewing decisions made under the ISA for procedural impropriety, Parliament did not disturb the principle laid down in Chng Suan Tze that the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion– that <b>is,</b> <b>power</b> without legal limits– is contrary to the rule of law, which demands that courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power. Since Parliament did not undermine this principle when it legislatively reversed Chng Suan Tze, it should be taken to have implicitly endorsed the principle.|$|E

25|$|After {{passing through}} the vestibule, Dante and Virgil reach the ferry that will take them across the river Acheron and to Hell proper. The ferry is piloted by Charon, who {{does not want to}} let Dante enter, for he is a living being. Virgil forces Charon to take him by declaring, Vuolsi così colà dove si puote / ciò che si vuole ("It is so willed there where <b>is</b> <b>power</b> to do / That which is willed"), {{referring}} to the fact that Dante is on his journey on divine grounds. The wailing and blasphemy of the damned souls entering Charon's boat contrast with the joyful singing of the blessed souls arriving by ferry in the Purgatorio. The passage across the Acheron, however, is undescribed, since Dante faints and does not awaken until he is on the other side.|$|E
25|$|The candela (cd) is the SI unit of {{luminous}} intensity, that <b>is</b> <b>power</b> {{per unit}} solid angle {{in a given}} direction, weighted according to {{the sensitivity of the}} human eye to various colours of light. A typical candle produces light with about 1 candela of luminous intensity in all directions. A lamp can produce higher luminous intensity either by producing more light, or by focusing it tighter. The luminous intensity of a light depends on many factors, including the colour of the light and the eye's sensitivity to that colour, the optics involved, reflector and lens. Despite its complexity, it is a more useful measure than watts, because it defines how much usable light is shed in a given place: a dynamo headlight designed for road use and focused for seeing the road makes more efficient use {{of the power of the}} lamp than lights using rotationally symmetrical optics.|$|E

25|$|The series' main {{theme is}} {{responsibility}} {{as seen through}} Kenshin's action as he wants to atone {{for all the people}} he killed during the Bakumatsu by aiding innocent people by wielding a non-lethal sword. Marco Olivier from the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University said that the sakabatō symbolizes Kenshin's oath not to kill again which has been found challenging by other warriors appearing in the series. This theme also encourages former drug dealer Takani Megumi into becoming a doctor upon learning of Kenshin's past and actions. Another theme <b>is</b> <b>power</b> which is mostly seen by Sagara Sanosuke and Myojin Yahiko. However, like Megumi, these two characters are also influenced by the main character as they wish to become stronger in order to assist Kenshin across the plot. Additionally, the series discourages revenge as seen in the final arc when Yukishiro Enishi believes he succeeded in getting his revenge on Kenshin but starts having hallucinations of his late sister with a sad expression on her face.|$|E
25|$|The {{financial}} {{problems of the}} College were based upon {{the fact that there}} had been a failure to find a 'local Carnegie' – a business magnate who could finance the University by providing endowments and financing the payment of staff. The passing of the Technical Instruction Act empowered local authorities to level a rate for technical instruction. Bristol was able to apply for a further £2,000 in funds and a further £500 was gained in return for an agreement that free places would be made available to some students. This money was used to build an Engineering block. A few months earlier the Medical School building had been finished and formally incorporated into the College. It was not until 1899 that the College began to receive any kind of state funding, leading one lecturer to joke that the motto of the College should be not Knowledge <b>is</b> <b>power</b> but College is poor; until this time the college was wholly dependent upon the student fees paid for the courses. However, the College was expanded as finances allowed during the 1890s after it had teetered on the edge of bankruptcy several times the decade before.|$|E
25|$|Rising Storm is a children's fantasy novel, {{the fourth}} {{book in the}} Warriors series, written by Cherith Baldry and Kate Cary (Plus two others) under the pen name of Erin Hunter. Rising Storm was written by Kate Cary. The series follows the adventures of four Clans of wild, {{anthropomorphic}} cats. In the previous book, Forest of Secrets, Graystripe's mate, Silverstream, died while giving birth. ThunderClan and RiverClan fought over the two kits, seeing {{as the mother of}} the kits, Silverstream, was the daughter of the RiverClan leader, Crookedstar, and the father was Graystripe, a ThunderClan warrior. Graystripe decided to join RiverClan, despite knowing he will be shunned there. In Rising Storm, Fireheart has to tackle his new duties as deputy, knowing that the old one, Tigerclaw, who had been exiled, is in the forest somewhere, seeking revenge against Fireheart, Bluestar, and ThunderClan. At the end of the book, Tigerclaw becomes leader of ShadowClan and receives the name Tigerstar, finally achieving the position he killed for. The main theme in the book <b>is</b> <b>power.</b> The forest in the book is inspired by multiple natural locations, such as the New Forest, in southern England.|$|E

25|$|Leader-focused {{approaches}} look to organizational {{leaders to}} determine the characteristics of effective leadership. According to the trait approach, more effective leaders possess certain traits that less effective leaders lack. More recently, this approach {{is being used to}} predict leader emergence. The following traits have been identified as those that predict leader emergence when there is no formal leader: high intelligence, high needs for dominance, high self-motivation, and socially perceptive. Another leader-focused approached is the behavioral approach which focuses on the behaviors that distinguish effective from ineffective leaders. There are two categories of leadership behaviors: (1) consideration; and (2) initiating structure. Behaviors associated with the category of consideration include showing subordinates they are valued and that the leader cares about them. An example of a consideration behavior is showing compassion when problems arise in or out of the office. Behaviors associated with the category of initiating structure include facilitating the task performance of groups. One example of an initiating structure behavior is meeting one-on-one with subordinates to explain expectations and goals. The final leader-focused approach <b>is</b> <b>power</b> and influence. To be most effective a leader should be able to influence others to behave in ways that are in line with the organization's mission and goals. How influential a leader can be depends on their social power or their potential to influence their subordinates. There are six bases of power: coercive power, reward power, legitimate power, expert power, referent power, and informational power. A leader can use several different tactics to influence others within an organization. These common tactics include: rational persuasion, inspirational appeal, consultation, ingratiation, exchange, personal appeal, coalition, legitimating, and pressure.|$|E
