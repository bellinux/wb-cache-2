40|$|Oil-in-water emulsions, as used {{in metal}} working and <b>fire-resistant</b> {{hydraulic}} <b>fluids,</b> often show poor lubricating performance and {{one reason for this}} is their inability to form effective elastohydrodynamic films. This paper considers how the composition of an oil-in-water emulsion contributes to its lubricating properties. A key factor in oil-in-water emulsion performance lies in the ability of the dispersed oil droplets to wet polar metal surfaces and thus promote full elastohydrodynamic lubrication, without starvation, up to high speeds. In this paper it is shown how this ability can be quantified in terms of measurable surface chemical parameters. Based on this work, three rules for designing lubricious oil-in-water emulsions are proposed. Where possible (a) the emulsifier concentration used should be just below its critical micelle concentration value, (b) the base oil should be polar and (c) the base oil should be viscous. The first two of these factors will promote oil-phase surface wetting while the third will ensure thick-film formation in the full elastohydrodynamic regime. <br/...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{ignition}} of non-fire-resistant hydraulic fluid sprays was conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Both an open flame and a hot steel surface were used as the external heat sources. With the open flame as the heat source, the minimum oil temperature and minimum spray nozzle pressure that resulted in an ignition were measured. The effects of {{the distance between the}} open flame and the nozzle and the nozzle orifice diameter on the ignitability of the hydraulic fluid sprays were examined. With the hot surface as the heat source, the minimum surface ignition temperature was determined. The degree of oil atomization and the relative direction of oil injection with respect to the hot surface are discussed. The ignition of oil sprays from the impingement of oil jets onto a vertical surface was also investigated. Finally, the results are compared with those obtained for <b>fire-resistant</b> hydraulic <b>fluids.</b> Keywords: Ignition; hot surface; open flame; hydraulic flui...|$|R

40|$|During 1990 - 2001, a {{total of}} 518 fires {{occurred}} in all metal/ nonmetal mining categories; 296 of those fires caused 308 injuries and 4 fatalities. Surface operations had the most fires and the highest injury risk rate values. Forty-five fires destroyed or heavily damaged facilities and equipment (including 19 pieces of mobile equipment) because of failure of firefighting methods, late fire detection, undetected fires, or fire size. In the future, many of these fires and injuries might be prevented or detected and extinguished at their earliest stage by improving current fire safety procedures, adopting existing/ improved fire detection and suppression technologies, and/or developing new technologies. Several strategies for reducing and/or preventing the number of fires and fire injuries follow. I. Increase vigilance, improve safety procedures, and develop new technologies {{in order to prevent}} fires and injuries caused by fame cutting and welding operations. 2.

40|$|Oil-in-water (O/W) {{emulsions}} {{are widely}} used in metal rolling and cutting and also as <b>fire-resistant</b> hydraulic <b>fluids.</b> For both of these applications they require a reasonable degree of lubricating ability—in metal rolling to protect the surfaces against wear and seizure {{and to provide a}} controlled value of friction, and in hydraulics to limit the extent of wear, scuffing and fatigue of rubbing pump components. The lubricating properties of O/W emulsions are significantly poorer than those of most water-free oils and this deficiency can create service problems, such as excessive wear or rolling contact fatigue of hydraulic pumps or the uneven rolling or heat streaking of metal strip. Considerable work has gone into the design of O/W emulsions which have acceptable lubricating properties combined with satisfactory emulsion stability and corrosion resistance. Much of this work has been empirical, although there have also been a number of more fundamental studies of the film-forming and friction properties of emulsions. The latter have shown that the ability of O/W emulsions to form films in rubbing contacts is very dependent on the rolling speed of the contact and also the composition of the emulsion. This paper describes a study {{of the relationship between the}} composition and properties of O/W emulsions and the extent to which they form elastohydrodynamic films in contacts over a range of speeds. By applying surface chemical principles to maximize the tendency of the oil in O/W emulsions to wet the surfaces, it is shown how the composition of an O/W emulsion can be optimized to yield satisfactory film formation and, thus, low friction and wear over a wide range of speed conditions <br/...|$|R
40|$|PART 1. A {{number of}} cyclic oxyphosphoranes have been {{prepared}} and their dynamic n. m. r. spectra investigated. The changes in the spectra with temperature are interpreted {{in terms of the}} slowing of certain pseudo-rotations available to the molecule and the energetic data derived from the spectral changes are suggested to be a measure of the relative apicophi 1 i cities of the groups bonded to phosphorus. The scale of apicophilicity values so obtained is explained in terms of the following properties of the ligand: electronegativity, ?-donor ability, ?-acceptor ability, polarisability and size. From a study of the energy required to place the five-membered ring of various cyclic oxyphosphoranes in the diequatorial position it is concluded that this energy increases considerably with the presence of endocyclic heteroatoms bonded to phosphorus. The increase in ring strain is attributed to the changes in orientation of the donor orbitals of the heteroatoms when the ring is moved from an apical-equatorial to a diequatorial position. The same donor orbital orientation effect {{has been shown to be}} present in six-membered cyclic oxyphosphoranes, although in this case it is suggested that the conformation of the six-membered ring may decrease the heteroatom rotation terms compared with the values for five-membered rings. D. n. m. r. data for a series of oxyphosphoranes, where the size of the alkyl groups bonded to phosphorus is varied, have been interpreted in terms of the following two tenets: (a) the apical position of a trigonal bipyramid is the more hindered position; and (b) steric effects in phosphoranes are not appreciable unless there are at least two bulky groups bonded to phosphorus. Evidence has been presented that nucleophilic substitution at the phosphorus of oxyphosphoranes need not necessarily proceed by attack of the nucleophile directly opposite the leaving group. PART 2. A range of phosphoryl compounds has been synthesised and their suitability for use as <b>fire-resistant</b> hydraulic <b>fluids</b> has been assessed by determining their hydrolytic stability, fire resistance and melting point...|$|R
