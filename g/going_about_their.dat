In 1868, Cassatt also studied with artist Thomas Couture, whose subjects were mostly romantic and urban.

In 1868 one of her paintings, A Mandoline Player, was accepted {{for the first time}} by the selection jury for the Paris Salon. With Elizabeth Jane Gardner, whose work was also accepted by the jury that year, Cassatt was one of two American women to first exhibit in the Salon. A Mandoline Player is in the Romantic style of Corot and Couture, and is one of only two paintings from the first decade of her career that is documented today.|$|E

25|$|Penthouse, {{started by}} Bob Guccione in England in 1965, took a {{different}} approach. Women looked indirectly at the camera, {{as if they were}} <b>going</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> private idylls. This change of emphasis was influential in erotic depictions of women. Penthouse was also the first magazine to publish pictures that included pubic hair and , both of which were considered beyond the bounds of the erotic and in the realm of pornography at the time. In the late 1960s, magazines began to move into more explicit displays often focusing on the buttocks as standards of what could be legally depicted and what readers wanted to see changed. By the 1970s, they were focusing on the pubic area and eventually, by the 1990s, featured sexual penetration, lesbianism and homosexuality, group sex, masturbation, and fetishes in the more hard-core magazines such as Hustler.|$|E
25|$|On {{their journey}} back to Wu, the fleet passed by Baiwei (白圍), where Lu Xun {{announced}} {{that they would be}} getting off their vessels to go ashore for a hunting expedition. However, he actually gave secret orders to his subordinates Zhou Jun (周峻) and Zhang Liang (張梁) to lead their men to attack Xinshi (新市), Anlu (安陸) and Shiyang (石陽) counties in Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡). Outside Shiyang County, the common people were <b>going</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> daily activities in the marketplace when Zhou Jun and his men showed up. The people immediately packed up everything and attempted to rush to safety behind the city walls. The Wei soldiers in Shiyang wanted to close the city gates but the civilians were blocking the way, so they killed some people and forced the gates to be shut. Zhou Jun and his men killed and captured over 1,000 civilians in Shiyang. The captives were resettled in Wu. Lu Xun gave orders to his men, forbidding them from harassing the people. Those captives who had their families with them were given due attention and care while those who lost their loved ones during the raid were provided with food and clothing and treated well before they were sent home. Many people were so touched by Lu Xun's acts of kindness that they decided to move to Wu territory. When news of Lu Xun's kindness spread to the neighbouring regions, two Wei officers, Zhao Zhuo (趙濯) and Fei Sheng (斐生), and a tribal king, Meiyi (梅頤), led their followers to join Lu Xun. Lu Xun generously distributed rewards to them.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Fiona Buffini {{directed}} a touring production for the RSC. Premiering at the Swan, the production starred Alex Avery as Valentine, Laurence Mitchell as Proteus, Vanessa Ackerman as Julia and Rachel Pickup as Silvia. Buffini set the {{play in a}} swinging 1930s milieu, and featuring numerous dance numbers. Additionally, London and New York replaced Verona and Milan; initially, Valentine and Proteus are shown as living in the English countryside, in a rural paradise devoid of any real vitality, the sons of wealthy families who have retired from the city. When Valentine leaves, he heads to New York to pursue the American Dream and {{falls in love with}} Silvia, the famous actress daughter of a powerful media magnate. Another change to the play was that the roles of the outlaws (represented here as a group of paparazzi) were increased considerably. Scenes added to the play show them arriving in New York and <b>going</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> daily business, although none of the new scenes featured any dialogue. Another performance worth noting occurred at the Courtyard Theatre in Stratford in 2006. A non-professional acting company from Brazil, named Nós do Morro, in collaboration with a Gallery 37 group from Birmingham, gave a single performance of the play during the RSC's presentation of the Complete Works, directed by Guti Fraga. The production was spoken in Portuguese, with the original English text projected as surtitles onto the back of the stage. It also featured two 17-year-olds in the roles of Valentine and Proteus (usually, actors in their 20s are cast), and Crab was played not by a dog, but by a human actor in a dog costume. In 2009, Joe Dowling directed the play at the Guthrie Theater, starring Sam Bardwell as Valentine, Jonas Goslow as Proteus, Sun Mee Chomet as Julia and Valeri Mudek as Silvia. Staged as a 1950s live television production, large black-and-white monitors were set {{on either side of the}} stage, with cameras feeding the action to them. Additionally, period advertisements appeared both before the show and during the intermission. The actors spoke the original dialogue, but wore 1950s clothing. Rock and roll music and dance sequences were occasionally mixed with the action.|$|E

5000|$|Jang Cheolmun’s poetry uses {{language}} that is not provocative, but instead uses a subtle voice to clearly depict things and the world. From when he published his first poetry collection, he was described as contemplating {{the world in a}} very mature manner. With rich language, he calmly depicted sights of nature flowing, and people <b>going</b> on <b>about</b> <b>their</b> lives. Such characteristics can be said as having faithfully inherited the characteristics of traditional lyric poetry. Early in his career, his poetry featured average people that lived in the real world. However, his poetry gradually took more influence from Eastern outlook, and Buddhist philosophy. This is probably because of how he practiced Buddhism in Southeast Asia in early 2000s.|$|R

[...] Author Robert Eberwein describes the filmic experience as the merging of a viewer's consciousness with the projected consciousness of the screen's subject, a process whereby the viewer's prior experiences with dreaming [...] "help {{to create a sense}} of oneness" [...] with cinema, causing the gap between viewer and what is being viewed to narrow. Under this theory, no matter what is being shown on the screen — whether the literal representation of a character dreaming, or the fictional characters of a story <b>going</b> on <b>about</b> <b>their</b> fictional lives — the very process of viewing film itself [...] "replicates activities associated with the oneiric experience." ...|$|R

So in the nineteenth century the great nobles who became mine-owners and railway directors earnestly assured everybody that they did not do this from preference, but owing to a newly discovered Economic Law.

The next day, the Indians came ashore from a sixteen-passenger canoe (which could hold 4 men, 4 women and 8 children) and notified the Tejas guide that they wished for Alarcón and his men to leave. As a peace offering, Alarcón presented the Indians with tobacco and clothing on behalf of the Spanish crown, which they accepted. In exchange, the Indians offered Alarcón dried fish, and directed him toward the former French fort of St. Louis, believing Alarcón wanted to establish a colony on the bay. Alarcón declared the bay for Spain, but did not establish a permanent settlement.|$|E
500|$|Farihah Zaman of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B" [...] and criticized its {{excessive}} narrative threads.

White also applauded the short sequence that showed many of the office staff mundanely <b>going</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> day with mayonnaise on their heads, noting that the pacing was reminiscent of the first season when the episodes [...] "had room to breathe". White, however, did feel that Jim's storyline was too reminiscent of the story arc in the fifth season when Pam went to art school.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} the 1967 album, Something Else By The Kinks, {{developed}} the musical progressions of Face to Face, adding English music hall influences to the band's sound. Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's [...] "Death of a Clown". While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single. Overall, however, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting the Kinks to rush out a new single, [...] "Autumn Almanac", in early October. Backed with [...] "Mister Pleasant", the single became another Top 5 success for the group. Andy Miller points out that, despite its success, the single marks {{a turning point in}} the band's career—it would be their last entry into the UK Top Ten for three years: [...] "In retrospect, 'Autumn Almanac' marked the first hint of trouble for the Kinks. This glorious single, one of the greatest achievements of British 60s pop, was widely criticised at the time for being too similar to previous Davies efforts." [...] Nick Jones of Melody Maker asked, [...] "Is it time that Ray stopped writing about grey suburbanites <b>going</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> fairly unemotional daily business? ... Ray works to a formula, not a feeling, and it's becoming rather boring." [...] Disc jockey Mike Ahern called the song [...] "a load of old rubbish". Dave's second solo single, [...] "Susannah's Still Alive", was released in the UK on 24 November. It sold a modest 59,000 copies, but failed to reach the Top 10.
