25|$|The stadium, {{designed}} by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, was built within an artificial landfill (over the refuse) {{to eliminate the}} need for multilevel ramps. As a result, construction took just nine months and cost approximately $2.3million. Two hundred and <b>fifty</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> was contributed by the Autzen Foundation, headed by Thomas E. Autzen, son of Portland lumberman and philanthropist Thomas J. Autzen (1888–1958), for whom the stadium was named. Ironically, Autzen was an alumnus of archrival Oregon State University. The foundation's donation was linked to his son, a UO alumnus from the class of 1943.|$|E

2500|$|Santiago is {{responsible}} for improving the status of Comerío to that of autonomous municipality, gaining fiscal liberty from the central government. This resulted in an investment approaching <b>fifty</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars.</b> The performance of the municipality's finances earned it an [...] "A" [...] grade from the Controllership office, the entity responsible for the fiscalization of public institutions. Santiago is a supporter of Puerto Rican culture, organizing several activities to promote it at the Casa de la Cultura Cacique Comerío, a municipal atrium. He also hosts a competition between performers of trova, a traditional Puerto Rican music, at the town's commemoration of its jíbaro heritage, the Festival Jíbaro Comerieño. Santiago established an environment-protection program, assigning seven percent of Comerío's terrain for conservation {{in order to protect}} the Puerto Rican plain pigeon, an endangered bird species. An extension of this initiative was the production of biodiesel to run a citywide trolley array. The municipality also ranks first in Puerto Rico when ranking the performance of its recycling program. Following the application of the Fiscal Emergency Act (Law No.7) by governor Luis Fortuño, the municipality of Comerío suffered numerous cuts in personnel and services, which made the unemployment rate soar and prompted constant confrontation between the municipality and the central government. Upon taking office, the Fortuño administration went on to close the offices of Retirement Affairs, Electrical Energy Authority, Environmental and Health Affairs, the Superintendent of Schools, Agriculture Extension Initiative, the Center for Agricultural Affairs and a Head Start program. Santiago attended this by applying countermeasures, attempting to save the Industrial Cooperative by pursuing an alliance with the Puerto Rico Police Department which would make the official manufacturer of uniforms for the force. He arranged support from the Puerto Rico Department of Education and supported a vocation school, before also establishing an agreement with a private university in order to provide cheap nocturnal education for the unemployed inhabitants. Santiago spearheaded the construction of Hotel Media Luna, a hotel that he expects will help by offering employment. He {{is responsible}} for the establishment of the Biblioteca y Centro Cíbernetico Laura Arroyo Torrens, a cyber-library that offers online-classes supported by the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico. Under his incumbency, Comerío became the first municipality of the central-mountainous region to offer gratituous Wi-Fi connection in its recreation plaza and to receive a hardware upgrade allowing faster rates. After the municipality failed to receive funds from the central administration for road reppairs, Santiago secured external funds and attended a public bid to obtain additional vehicles to ensure maintenance. The municipal administration support the local AA Baseball franchise, the Pescadores del Plata de Comerío, which won the national championship in 2003. He {{is responsible for}} building the a new municipal auditorium, which has been used to host youth volleyball and basketball tournaments promoted by the municipality. Santiago also began an initiative to promote sports and combat childhood obesity, Jugando por tu Salud. He has also hosted a 10-kilometre marathon, the Maratón El Seco.|$|E

The suit alleges that the officials not only knew that the water was contaminated and still gave it to the people of Crestwood, but also that the officials named lied to the state, the federal government and the people of Crestwood as many as 122 times. Madigan seeks a <b>fifty</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollar</b> fine against each party and an additional ten <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> per occasion of dishonesty. All of the named parties have already admitted to the fact that they used the water from well number one. Madigan insists this is the first step in a long process and does not rule out criminal charges.|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} irrational human {{practices}} {{on the environment}} makes it indispensable to implement measures, such as the Upper Gulf of California and Colorado River Delta Biosphere Reserve, {{in order to preserve}} the natural environment and habitats, and thus to promote biological diversity. The aim of this paper was to determine the local economic support through valuation of the vaquita porpoise, an endangered endemic species that lives in the reserve, as well as to disseminate the analytic network process, a valuation methodology little used in the environmental issue and which appropriately integrates interrelations into a systemic scheme. The result showed that for the purpose of giving protection to the species, resources additional to the little more than two million seven hundred and <b>fifty</b> <b>thousand</b> American <b>dollars</b> a year, which is the vaquita porpoise’s value, are needed. In carrying out this study, more comprehensive data concerning productive activities in the area, socio-economic implications of fishing and its impact on biological diversity were not available. This paper’s originality and value lie in the methodology used and the interrelation it offers for analysis...|$|R

The money transfer to countries outside of common monetary area is particularly very expensive because of high banks commission {{and one of the}} poorest currency buying & selling rates.

60|$|Our passage out was a {{very long}} one, lasting two hundred and ten days. When {{we got into the}} trades, we {{stripped}} one mast after the other, to a girt-line, overhauling everything, and actually getting new gangs of rigging up over the lower-mast-heads. We were a long time about it, but lost little or nothing in distance, as the ship was going before the wind the whole time, with everything packed on the masts that were rigged. Before overhauling the rigging, we fell in with an English ship, called the General Blucher, and kept company with her for quite a fortnight. While the two ships were together, we were chased by a strange brig, that kept in sight three or four days, evidently watching us, and both vessels suspected him of being a pirate. As we had six guns, and thirty-one souls, and the Blucher was, at least, as strong, the two captains thought, by standing by each other, they might beat the fellow off, should he attack us. The brig frequently came near enough to {{get a good look at}} us, and then dropped astern. He continued this game several days, until he suddenly hauled his wind, and left us.

5000|$|Leslie Holdridge {{established}} La Selva in 1953. Holdridge was an American botanist and climatologist who {{is known}} for his widely used classification system of land areas called The Holdridge Life Zones System. He originally purchased the land to use as a farm for experimenting with mixed agriculture, and was especially interested in experimenting with tree crops that could be planted without total clearing of the native forest. [...] In the beginning, La Selva was a challenge to get to; the trip required a long, treacherous dirt road followed by a 4-kilometer dugout canoe trip. In 1968 the Organization of Tropical Studies (OTS) bought the area for <b>fifty</b> <b>thousand</b> US <b>dollars</b> {{to be used as a}} private reserve and biological station. OTS was a small, 5-year-old organization created with the goal of facilitating research and education in the tropics. Holdridge encouraged OTS to use La Selva as a research site even before it became OTS property. Holdridge supported research at La Selva until his death in 1999. Since the station’s beginnings in 1953, there have been immense changes: access is easy, buildings have been constructed, and the preserve has tripled in size. It is now one of the most important sites for tropical research in the world. In the past few decades, however, the human population around the Station have increased rapidly due to several factors, including the expansion of banana production and government settlement projects.|$|R
