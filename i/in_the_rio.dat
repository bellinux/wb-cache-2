5|$|During the Tauca phase, {{water levels}} in Laguna Miscanti {{were higher than}} today; shorelines formed from an event in Ch'iyar Quta lake; saline lakes formed in the Lipez area, and water levels rose in the Guayatayoc-Salinas Grandes basin and lakes at Uturuncu and Lazufre. Some Atacama Altiplano lake levels {{increased}} by , and evidence exists at the Quebrada Mani archeological site for a higher water supply 16,400–13,700 years ago. During the Tauca, greater flow occurred in rivers in the Atacama region; more precipitation fell <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> Salado valley; the excavation of the Colca Canyon may have been aided by an increased water supply, and glaciers advanced in the Cordillera de Cochabamba. A moraine formed at Hualca Hualca; the Choqueyapu II glacier in the Eastern Cordillera advanced; moraines formed from glacial advances in Argentina (including the Sierra de Santa Victoria); basal sliding glaciers formed at Sajama; landslide activity in northwestern Argentina decreased; the climate grew wetter over the southern Amazon; flooding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Río</b> Paraguay-Parana basin and precipitation and forest cover in Pampa del Tamarugal increased; erosion occurred along the Pilcomayo, {{and an increase in}} Pacific plankton was probably linked to increased runoff (and an increased nutrient supply) from the Andes. A glacial advance in central Chile around 15,000 years ago, also associated with increased precipitation and the Lake Tauca period, was probably triggered by tropical circulation changes.|$|E
5|$|Irene Garza (1934 – April 1960) was a South Texas {{teacher and}} beauty queen whose death {{has been the}} subject of {{investigation}} for several decades. Garza was last seen alive on April 16, 1960, when she went to confession at a church in McAllen, Texas. She was reported missing the following morning. Following the largest volunteer search to that date <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> Grande Valley, Garza's body was discovered in a canal on April 21. An autopsy concluded that she had been sexually assaulted before being killed; the cause of death was suffocation.|$|E

5|$|Israel fielded a {{squad of}} two {{synchronized}} swimmers {{to compete in the}} women's duet by virtue of their twelfth-place finish at the FINA Olympic test event in Rio de Janeiro. Anastasia Gloushkov competed in her fourth Olympics, becoming the first Israeli woman to compete in four Olympics. Even though Gloushkov gave birth after the London Olympics, she still trained enough to compete <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> Olympics. The duo scored 79.4488 points in the technical routine, placing 20th in that portion. They placed 21st in the free routine, scoring 78.9000 points. Their combined score was 158.3488, garnering 20th place overall. To qualify for the finals, they required a score better than 170.3304 points.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 1903, the {{expedition}} reached Port Stanley, where they received their first {{news from the}} outside world since leaving the Cape Verde Islands. After a week's rest, Scotia departed for Buenos Aires, where she was to be repaired and provisioned for another season's work. Bruce had further business in the city; he intended to persuade the Argentine government to assume responsibility for the Laurie Island meteorological station after {{the expedition}}'s departure. During the voyage to Buenos Aires, Scotia ran aground <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Río</b> de la Plata estuary, and was stranded for several days before floating free and being assisted into port by a tug, on 24 December.|$|E
5|$|Starting at 2100UTC on August9, a {{tropical}} storm warning was issued from Baffin Bay, Texas to La Pesca, Tamaulipas while Gabrielle was still Tropical Depression Eight. By 0900UTC on the following day, the warning was expanded to include areas south to Tampico, Tamaulipas and extended further to Tuxpan, Veracruz twelve hours later. As the latter was occurring, the tropical storm warning was discontinued for Texas. Early on August12, all the warnings in Mexico were discontinued, as the storm had already moved inland. 800people were evacuated in Soto la Marina and San Fernando in Tamaulipas. People in poor villages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> Grande Valley were given sandbags with Tropical Storm Gabrielle approaching.|$|E

The two athletes that were selected to compete <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> Games were Yordanys Durañona in the men's triple jump and Thea LaFond in the women's triple jump. Durañona was selected as the flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The Río Bec style forms a {{sub-region}} of the Chenes style, {{and also}} features {{elements of the}} Central Petén style, such as prominent roof combs. Its palaces are distinctive for their false-tower decorations, lacking interior rooms, with steep, almost vertical, stairways and false doors. These towers were adorned with deity masks, and were built to impress the viewer, rather than serve any practical function. Such false towers are only found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Río</b> Bec region. Río Bec sites include Chicanná, Hormiguero, and Xpuhil.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} is {{considered}} a threat by cattle ranchers due to its predation on newborn cattle. The droppings produced by black vultures and other vultures can harm or kill trees and other vegetation.

5|$|The {{developments}} in Uruguay were closely watched by the Empire of Brazil, which had vital interests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Río</b> de la Plata Basin. After Rosas fell in 1852, Brazil became the dominant regional power. Its foreign policy included the covert underwriting of opposition parties in Uruguay and Argentina, preventing strong governments that might threaten Brazil's strategic {{position in the}} area. Brazilian banking and commercial firms also had ventures in the area, furthering ties within the region. In Uruguay, the bank run by Irineu Evangelista de Sousa (Baron and later Viscount of Mauá) became so heavily involved in commercial enterprises that the economy depended on this source of continued capital flow.|$|E
5|$|The four athletes {{that were}} chosen to compete <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> Games were Adama Jammeh in the men's 200 metres, Gina Bass in the women's 200 metres, Faye Njie in the men's {{lightweight}} judo competition and Pap Jonga in the men's 50 metre freestyle swimming contest. Three of the team's competitors trained at the Centro di Preparazione Olimpica di Formia after The Gambia's NOC secured funding for overseas training. Along with the four athletes, the country's delegation consisted of the NOC development officer and team leader Alhagie Dodou Capi Joo, athletics coach Mariama Sallah Saine, and swimming coach Arfang Y. Jobe. Bass {{was selected as the}} flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The two athletes {{that were}} {{selected}} to compete <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> Games were Benjamín Enzema in the men's 800 metres and Reïna-Flor Okori in the women's 100 metre hurdles. Equatorial Guinea {{was one of several}} countries who sent a delegation of two athletes in 2016, with only Tuvalu sending a single competitor. Along with the two athletes, the country's delegation was led by the vice-president of Equatorial Guinea Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue. The country's Olympic women's football team failed to qualify for the Games after being defeated by South Africa on aggregate in a two-leg playoff match in October 2015. Okori was selected as the flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{landfall}} near Tampico, {{a station}} in the city recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 1,004mbar (hPa; 29.65inHg), the lowest pressure measured {{in association with the}} storm. Due to a lack of available weather ships in the region because of World War II, no ships documented the tropical cyclone. In Texas, the tropical cyclone caused light rainfall, damaging local cotton crops. Strong wind gusts were observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> Grande Valley.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín {{suffered}} {{a car crash}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Río</b> Negro province in 1999, during the campaign of governor Pablo Verani. They were on Route6, and he was ejected from the car {{because he was not}} wearing a seat belt. He was hospitalized for 39 days. DelaRúa became president in the 1999 elections, defeating the governor of Buenos Aires, Eduardo Duhalde. Alfonsín was elected Senator for Buenos Aires Province in October 2001. DelaRúa resigned during the December 2001 riots, and the Congress appointed Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, who resigned as well. Alfonsín instructed the radical legislators to support Duhalde as the new president. He also gave him two ministers, Horacio Jaunarena for Defense and Jorge Vanossi for Justice. The radical support helped Duhalde overcome the ambitions of Carlos Ruckauf and José Manuel de la Sota, who also had ambitions to be appointed president. Alfonsín's health problems later in the year led him to step down, to be replaced by Diana Conti.|$|E
5|$|As far as known, Oryzomys gorgasi has a disjunct {{distribution}} in northwestern South America, including Colombia, Venezuela, and Curaçao. In a 2009 paper, Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales speculated that its distribution may extend into Central America. The Colombian population is {{known from the}} holotype only, caught at Loma Teguerre (7°54'N, 77°W) in Antioquia Department, northwestern Colombia, near the Río Atrato, at about 1m above sea level. The location is apparently a freshwater swamp, and Hershkovitz suggested that O.gorgasi probably occurred throughout the swamp forests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Río</b> Atrato basin. On Curaçao, it is known from cave faunas at Tafelberg Santa Barbara, Noordkant, Ser'i Kura, and Hermanus. At Tafelberg Santa Barbara, it was found in association with introduced black rats (Rattus rattus), indicating that the population persisted {{at least until the}} first European contact in 1499.|$|E
