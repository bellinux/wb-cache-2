To prevent anything intuitive from penetrating here unnoticed I had to bend every effort to keep the chain of inferences free of gaps [...] [...] [...] I found the inadequacy of language to be an obstacle; no matter how unwieldy the expressions I was ready to accept, I was less and less able, as the relations became more and more complex, to attain the precision that my purpose required. This deficiency led me to the idea of the present <b>ideography.</b> Its first purpose, therefore, is to provide us with the most reliable test of the validity of a chain of inferences and to point out every presupposition that tries to sneak in unnoticed" [...] (Frege 1879 in van Heijenoort 1967:5).|$|E
50|$|The Igbo {{language}} {{was used by}} John Goldsmith as an example to justify deviating from the classical linear model of phonology as laid out in The Sound Pattern of English. It is written in the Roman script {{as well as the}} Nsibidi formalized ideograms, which is used by the Ekpe society and Okonko fraternity, but is no longer widely used. Nsibidi <b>ideography</b> existed among the Igbo before the 16th century, but died out after it became popular among secret societies, who made Nsibidi a secret form of communication. Igbo language is difficult because of the huge number of dialects, its richness in prefixes and suffixes and its heavy intonation. Igbo is a tonal language and there are hundreds of different Igbo dialects and Igboid languages, such as the Ikwerre and Ekpeye languages. In 1939, Dr. Ida C. Ward led a research expedition on Igbo dialects which could possibly be used as a basis of a standard Igbo dialect, also known as Central Igbo. This dialect included that of the Owerri and Umuahia groups, including the Ohuhu dialect. This proposed dialect was gradually accepted by missionaries, writers, publishers, and Cambridge University.|$|E
40|$|Unlike Western thought, {{tending to}} the {{analytic}} and valuing personal reflection, Chinese thought is profoundly characterized by holism and impersonality. May these characteristics {{be determined by the}} language in which the thought is shaped and, more particularly, by the written language which in the West is conveyed in an analytical, alphabetic script and in China in an <b>ideography</b> of a holistic nature? Chinese <b>ideography</b> has its origins in scapulomantic divination whose extraordinary technical achievements coincide with the birth of this <b>ideography</b> {{at the beginning of the}} Yin epoch. One may think that it was the production of standardized divinatory graphs expressing various degrees of bad or good fortune that led to the empirical discovery of semanticity. A selective collection of documents produced in this original divination <b>ideography</b> served as the basis for the Confucian canon. Confucianism thus guarded against innovative, personal creations, always speculating on this canonical basis in a globalizing cosmological manner. Zhuang zi, who broke away from Confucianism, demystified Chinese <b>ideography,</b> stripping it of any divinatory transcendentalism while making it, on the other hand, a marvellous instrument of literary creation. However, he remained influenced by this <b>ideography,</b> as is seen in the impersonal form of his writing and the holistic polarization of his thought. Vandermeersch Léon.

40|$|Writing {{development}} in preschool children {{has only recently}} begun to receive attention; however, Russian researchers dealt with the subject in the 1920 s and 30 s. Arguing that writing was a fundamental assist to cognitive growth {{as well as a}} tool for communication, Lev Vygotskli believed that the preschool child was xeady to be taught writing. Alexander Luria's view of writing as a culturally mediated function of the individual served as an assumptive base in shaping his methodology for soliciting data from children. Results of his research suggested that the writing development process in young children is a general,progression (albeit one with periods of plateau and regression) from a first undifferentiated phase to and through pictography to a final stage of <b>ideography</b> where the child understands and exploits the 'symbolic potential of language. According to Luria, such development is analogous to other cultural developments. His evidenCe that considerable learning potential remains unexploited in preschool children should lead us to reexamine some of our assumptions about when and how to begin writing instruction with children. His findings could also be useful for the work currently being done in metalinguistic awareness studies.

40|$|The purport of this paper, {{with its}} {{somewhat}} odd title, is firstly, {{to indicate the}} fact that it was the people of the Mediterranean world who first brought geographical and cartographical information pertaining to China and Japan to the Western world, and secondly that it was the people of the Mediterranean world who first brought geographical and cartographical information on Europe to China and Japan. We treat China and Japan together because, from the viewpoint of cultural history, Japan belongs to the sphere of Chinese culture or the world where Chinese ideograms have been commonly used; in fact, historically, Japan is indebted to China not only for its <b>ideography,</b> but also for a great deal of its cultural heritage. Regarding material culture, already in the ancient period, or even going as far back as prehistoric times, goods from China arrived in the Mediterranean world and goods from the Mediterranean world reached China and as far as Japan. Evidence of these early trading exchanges are to be found in present-day Japan in the shape of objects stored in the Shosoin, the seventh-century imperial treasure house in Nara. But the trading activities of the period in question were carried out by intermediary merchants; generally speaking, the producers of the goods traded were indifferent as to where the goods were ultimately sold, and th...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore how four leaders from a Norwegian {{engineering}} company experience navigating change and influencing their organization to become more adaptive. Organizational change is presented as {{an introduction to the}} theoretical field going more into adaptive leadership, organizational transformation, consciousness, self-awareness, developmental theories on stages of leadership, helping skills in the counseling field and the LIFO method. This is a qualitative study based on an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) as the methodological approach. The participants lived experiences are explored and made sense of through contextualized interpretations. IPA`s roots are presented through phenomenology, hermeneutics and <b>ideography.</b> The analyzing process is described to give an insight of the research process, as well as the validity of the study, the researcher role and ethical considerations. The findings are presented in four main categories; the experience of change processes, controlling change and creating the correct behavior, influence in decision-making processes and inner development in the change process. To make more meaning of the findings they are discussed in light of relevant theory, in the four categories; control, communication, adaptability and influence. Through analyzing the participants experience according to the literature it is shown a complexity gap. The literature describes how navigating change in an adaptive way requires a complex mindset and this being a gap to how the participants experience it. It is further linked to how learning counseling skills can contribute to close this gap...|$|E
40|$|The message sent {{through the}} spacecrafts Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 {{addressed}} to possible extraterrestrial beings, {{is the opportunity}} for a reflection on the minimal intelligibility conditions of writing. The radical comprehension – expression recalling the Quine’s “radical translation” and Davidson’s “radical interpretation” – concerns that lowest content of comprehension that constitutes the writing as such, making it something that demands to be understood even in its indecipherability. Such minimum content consists in its being a trace of an existence. This thesis is supported by re-going through the sense of the subjective turning point of modern philosophy that has placed the diagrammatic dimension of writing on a prominent position. Examples are the Fregean <b>ideography</b> (as “diagram of truth”) {{on the one hand and}} the psychoanalytic interpretation of dreams (as “diagram of desire”) on the other hand. This turning point comes to its level of radicalism in the Heideggerian ontological hermeneutics that indissolubly weaves together comprehension and existence to the point that is possible to establish an analogy between the existential analysis and the several grades of text decipherability as it is here suggested: the passage from the inauthentic to the authentic existence can be read as passage from the semantic (radical interpretation) to the syntactic (radical translation) and to the ontological level (radical comprehension). The radical comprehension level is the one in which the lowest content of comprehension coincides with its formal condition of possibility: in which comprehending is to comprehend an existence...|$|E
40|$|The {{founder of}} modern logic and {{grandfather}} of analytic philosophy was 70 {{years old when}} he published his paper 'Der Gedanke' (The Thought) in 1918. This essay contains some of Gottlob Frege's deepest and most provocative reflections on the concept of truth, and it will play a prominent role in my lectures. The plan for my lectures is as follows. What is it that is (primarily) true or false? 'Thoughts', is Frege's answer. In § 1, I shall explain and defend this answer. In § 2, I shall briefly consider his enthymematic argument for the conclusion that the word 'true' resists any attempt at defining it. In § 3, I shall discuss his thesis that the thought that things are thus and so is identical with the thought that it is true that things are thus and so. The reasons we are offered for this thesis will be found wanting. In § 4, I shall comment extensively on Frege's claim that, in a non-formal language like the one I am currently trying to speak, we can say whatever we want to say without ever using the word 'true' or any of its synonyms. I will reject the propositional-redundancy claim, endorse the assertive-redundancy claim and deny the connection Frege ascribes to them. In his classic 1892 paper 'Über Sinn und Bedeutung' (On Sense and Signification) Frege argues that truth-values are objects. In § 5, I shall scrutinize his argument. In § 6, I will show that in Frege's <b>ideography</b> (Begriffsschrift) truth, far from being redundant, is omnipresent. The final § 7 is again on truth-bearers, this time as a topic in the theory of intentionality and in metaphysics. In the course of discussing Frege's views on the objecthood, the objectivity of thoughts and the timelessness of truth(s), I will plead for a somewhat mitigated Platonism...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} the life-world of transsexual women in relation to their awareness of their unique health needs as a direct result of sexual realignment treatment, and their health-seeking behaviours, practices and experiences of responses in negotiating health care for their transgender-related health needs in the healthcare system. The overarching question asked in this research was: What are the lived experiences, and meaning of these experiences, for transsexual women during the sexual-realignment process when negotiating health care for their transgender-related healthcare needs in the healthcare system? Participants in this study were selected through purposive and snowball sampling. In-depth interviews were conducted with ten participants selected from urban, peri-urban, and rural areas of the Western Cape. Theoretical saturation was reached with the tenth participant, and further selection of participants was ceased. The data was viewed through a trans-inclusive feminist lens with a concurrent collection and analysis process as guided by the steps of analysis of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), as developed by Smith (2010). IPA is a modern qualitative approach to research inquiry which harnesses the strengths of phenomenology, hermeneutics, and <b>ideography.</b> The analysed data were illustrated in a master theme graphic which contained one superordinate theme, two subordinate themes and various categories. The superordinate theme of this study was named "Towards organic Womanhood", while the two subordinate themes were coined "Embracing Womanhood", and "Facing the Giant in order to Become". The subordinate theme Embracing Womanhood gives insight into aspects of transsexual women's journey of moving towards a state of organic womanhood, whereas the subordinate theme Facing the Giant in order to Become maps out powers in the healthcare system which prevent transsexual women from having a smooth transition journey. This study illustrates that transsexual women have a need to align their bodies with their gender identities, but even though South Africa has legislation which protects the health and rights of transsexual women, transsexual women find it challenging to make the transition. Health practitioners are ill-equipped to manage transsexual women, the care which they receive in the government-funded healthcare system is of a poor standard, and they are 4 subjected to extremely long waiting periods to have access to surgical sexual realignment services. Recommendations are made for the healthcare system, policy makers and educational institutions in order to stimulate the South African healthcare system to become inclusive and affirming to the needs of transsexual women. Furthermore, recommendations for researchers are made to stimulate the debate around transsexual health care in the scientific literature...|$|E
