5|$|In December 1954, French sports {{magazine}} L'Equipe {{published an}} article by journalist and former professional footballer Gabriel Hanot, who proposed {{the introduction of a}} European club competition. He initially suggested that each country should nominate a club to play in a mid-week European league; many clubs favoured a cup competition, which required less matches to play. A year later, L'Equipe sent out invitations to 18 clubs, selected by Hanot, Jacques Ferran and Jacques Goddet, with UEFA agreeing to administrate the competition named as the European Champion Clubs' Cup. The European Cup Winners' Cup, later retitled the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, was founded in 1960 and involved the winning clubs of national cup competitions in Europe.

40|$|The Taylor {{rule and}} its {{variants}} played {{a prominent role}} in the monetary policy discussion among theoreticians and practitioners <b>for</b> more <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades.</b> The purpose of this thesis is to assess on the applicability of the simple instrument rules such as a classic Taylor's rule to the Czech economic environment which can be described as a small open economy with banking market specifically skewed by excess liquidity. The applicability is evaluated based on the variants of the Taylor rule and their effectiveness in describing the monetary policy of the central bank. The results of the models presented in this thesis are ambiguous. Traditional specification of the Taylor's rule is clearly unsuccessful in describing the behaviour of the Czech National Bank. However, if the models are altered to their historical variants containing only the information accessible at the time of decision making, their robustness and explanatory value increase significantly. Taking interest rate smoothing and exchange rate into consideration further improves the models. The policy behaviour of the Czech National Bank can be best described by the historical model with the one-year-ahead inflation prognosis, output gap, exchange rate and lagged target interest rate as explanatory variables. One of interesting results of this model is that the output gap does not play important role in the Czech National Bank decision making which is consistent with the opinions presented in the Czech National Bank Board Minutes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{research}} effort to date into optical wireless communication systems, both in academic and industrial contexts. The {{idea of using}} the optical medium for wireless communications is not new, having been proposed as a means <b>for</b> indoor communications <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> ago. However, {{the last few years}} have seen an explosive interest in the potential for free space optical systems to provide portable data communications. One of the prime motivators for reconsidering the use of an optical carrier in the wireless context is the demand for greater transmission bandwidths. The radio frequency spectrum is already exceedingly congested and frequency allocations of sufficient bandwidths are extremely hard to obtain. Further, for the high bandwidth services envisaged, the use of microwave or mm-wave systems will be required, where device technology is currently either expensive or immature. Proponents of optical wireless systems argue that the optical medium is the only cost-effective way to provide high bit-rate mobile services to volume markets. This paper identifies the technical obstacles and limitations of indoor optical wireless delivery in addition to techniques for mitigating these effects and shows that infrared is a viable alternative to radio for certain applications...|$|R
