40|$|Ovarian {{maturation}} {{in adult}} wild-sourced and pond-grown Scylla serrata (ForsskÃ¥l) was determined based on gross morphology and histological appearance. There {{were no significant}} differences noted in the histological features of both wild and pond-reared S. serrata females. Ovarian maturation was classified into five stages: immature, early maturing, late maturing, fully mature and spent. The immature ovaries are thin and translucent to off white and contain oogonia, primary oocytes with large nuclei. The follicle cells were found around the periphery of the lobes and an area among groups of oogonia and oocytes. The follicle cells gradually enclosed the oocytes. The early-maturing ovaries were yellow and small yolk globules started to appear in larger oocytes. In late-maturing ovaries, the colour became light orange and lobules were apparent. Yolk globules occurred in the cytoplasm with larger globular inclusions towards the periphery, while follicle cells were hardly recognizable. Fully mature ovaries were orange to deep orange and had swollen lobules. Large yolk globules were apparent in the entire cytoplasm. Follicle cells were hardly seen. Spent ovaries were similar to the early-maturing and late-maturing stage in partially spawned females. The ovarian development was correlated closely to the gonadosomatic index, oocyte diameter, and ovarian histology. The classification of ovarian maturation provides baseline information for further studies on reproductive biology. Likewise, the information provides a guide for broodstock management in the hatchery.

This research was carried out on March - August 2012 at Satker PBIAT (Centre of Fresh Water Fish <b>Hatchery</b> Working <b>Unit),</b> Janti – Klaten, Central Java Province. Sample used were F 5 red Larasati Tilapia seed from selective breeding with approximate length of 3 - 5 cm. A completely randomized design method was used with 5 treatments and 3 replications. Different saline media for the treatments were A (0 ‰); B (15 ‰), C (20 ‰), D (25 ‰) and E (30 ‰). The seeds were cultivated in a plastic container with water capacity of 20 liter and density of 20 fish per container. Result showed that in water media with salinity up to 15 ‰ the survival rate is equal to salinity of 0 ‰ at amount of 81. 67 ± 2, 89 %.

Its short history of domestication, along with the need to develop markets, new products and efficiency in the production process, has resulted in an increased interest in the potential genetic improvement of this species. Little work has so far been directed at establishing the procedures for selective breeding in gilthead seabream at a commercial level, although genetic parameters calculated in other studies have indicated that there is a large potential for improvement in certain traits. Selective breeding of commercial gilthead seabream populations is constrained by aspects of the biology that complicate the production of genetic groups and the maintenance of same-age offspring populations. The aim of this thesis was to develop a protocol for the selective breeding of gilthead seabream, specifically to serve a commercial <b>hatchery</b> and on-growing <b>unit</b> in Cyprus, where the fieldwork was carried out. The hatchery broodstock was monitored over a three-year period to identify the rate of sex reversal in introduced fish and to quantify the sex ratio of the stock over time. The analysis of the egg production records was used to evaluate the success of photoperiod manipulation in each group. Size variation in the larval and juvenile stages is a common problem in the rearing of gilthead seabream, leading to cannibalism and labour-intensive sorting operations. Studies on larval populations, from first feeding through to metamorphosis, indicated the origin of size variation was the differences in early feeding ability. The size advantages could be maintained throughout the larval period. During the juvenile stage of the farm production system, a method to standardise the size sorting of populations by grading was developed in order to counter environmental effects of separating groups of fish. Using this method, grading would be suitable to form the first stage of a selection programme for growth rate. The potential gain of selection for growth rate during the on-growing stage was very high, using a simulated criterion and previous estimates of heritability. Other possible quality traits for selection were also examined and quantified in the hatchery populations. Existing and specifically developed microsatellite markers were used for the assignment of offspring to parents from mass spawning of the hatchery broodstock. The effective population size of single spawning events were found to be low and determined by a high variation in contribution to mass spawning. Contribution was found to be significantly linked to body size, which led to the formation of a replacement policy for the broodstock to maximise spawning performance. Survival of individual families through the larval period was also examined. Based on the results of the experimental work, a two-stage selection programme was designed, along with the presentation of specific procedures for each stage of the production system. This project makes recommendations on various strategies that can increase the effective population size within a selection programme and these are discussed as part of the genetic management of hatchery populations. Significant progress has also been made in the use of genetic markers in monitoring the rate of inbreeding and contribution of individual broodfish, which are considered essential in this species.
