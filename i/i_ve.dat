40|$|The {{transient}} receptor potential (TRP) melastin 8 {{ion channel}} (TRPM 8) is implicated in bladder sensing but limited information on TRPM 8 antagonists in bladder overactivity (BO) is available. This study characterizes a new TRPM 8 -selective antagonist (DFL 23448) and evaluates it in cold-induced behavioral tests and on bladder function and experimental BO in vivo in rats. DFL 23448 displayed IC 50 values of 10 and 21 nM in hTRPM 8 HEK- 293 cells activated by Cooling Agent 10 or cold, but had limited activity (IC 50 > 10 μM) at TRPV 1, TRPA 1, TRPV 4, or at various G-protein-coupled receptors. In rats, DFL 23448 had a half-life of 37 minutes (intravenous; i. v.) or 4. 9 hours (oral). DLF 23448 (10 mg/kg, i. v) reduced icilin-induced wet-dog shakes in rats. Intravesical (<b>i.</b> <b>ves.)</b> DFL 23448 (10 mg/L) but not vehicle increased micturition intervals (MI), micturition volumes (MV) and bladder capacity (BC). During BO by <b>i.</b> <b>ves.</b> PGE 2, vehicle controls exhibited reductions of MI, MV and BC by 37 - 39 %, whereas the same parameters only decreased by 12 - 15 % (p< 0. 05 - 0. 01 vs. vehicle) in DFL 23448 -treated rats. In vehicle-treated rats {{but not in}} DFL 23448 -treated rats, <b>i.</b> <b>ves.</b> PGE 2 increased bladder pressures. Intravenous DFL 23448 at 10 mg/kg, but not 1 mg/kg DFL 23448 or vehicle, increased MI, MV, and BC. During BO by <b>i.</b> <b>ves.</b> PGE 2, MI, MV, and BC decreased in vehicle- and in DFL 23448 1 mg/kg-treated rats, but not in DFL 23448 10 mg/kg-treated rats. Bladder pressures increased less in rats treated with DFL 23448 10 mg/kg than in vehicle- or DFL 23448 1 mg/kg- treated rats. DFL 23448 (10 mg/kg, i. v.), but not vehicle, prevented cold-stress BO.
