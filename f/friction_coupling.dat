40|$|SummaryThe {{problem of}} <b>friction</b> <b>couples</b> remains {{unresolved}} to this day. Improvements in femoral and acetabulum implant anchorage {{over the last}} 20 years have significantly extended total hip replacement (THR) implant lifespan; the formation of wear debris, however, leads to resorption and osteolysis, considerably shortening implant lifespan in active patients. Alumina–alumina <b>friction</b> <b>couples</b> provide an excellent friction coefficient, with wear particles that do not cause any osteolysis. There is, however, a problem of acetabulum anchorage of solid alumina, {{and the risk of}} fracture persists with ceramic implants despite improvements in their mechanical properties. Metal–metal couples also display very good tribological behavior, but at the cost of the formation of Co and Cr ions impacting surrounding bone tissue and accumulating in remote organs. The behavior of such “hard–hard” couples greatly depends on implant component positioning and on the consequences of repeated neck-insert contact. Very highly crosslinked polyethylene (PE) shows very significant improvement in terms of wear at five years’ follow-up compared to conventional PE, but the behavior of this new concept will need to be monitored in the clinical situation if the disappointments experienced with previous hylamer-type improved PE are to be avoided. All these <b>friction</b> <b>couples</b> need to be validated by prospective clinical studies conducted over more than five years, to provide orthopedic surgeons with an eclectic choice of <b>friction</b> <b>couples</b> adapted to the patient's activity...|$|R

Our model assumes an intermode coupling between the CO frustrated translation (FT) and frustrated rotation (FR) modes with a weak and strong electronic <b>friction</b> <b>coupling</b> to hot electrons, respectively, and heat transfer between the FT mode and the substrate phonons. In this model the effective electronic <b>friction</b> <b>coupling</b> of the FT mode depends on the absorbed laser fluence F through {{the temperature of the}} FR mode.

40|$|The paper {{concerns}} {{evaluation of}} the coefficient of friction characterising a <b>friction</b> <b>couple</b> comprising a commercial brake disc cast of flake graphite grey iron and a typical brake pad for passenger motor car. For the applied interaction conditions, the brake pressure of 0. 53 MPa and the linear velocity measured on the pad-disc trace axis equalling 15 km/h, evolution of the friction coefficient μ values were observed. It turned out that {{after a period of}} 50 minutes, temperature reached the value 270 °C and got stabilised. After this time interval, the friction coefficient value also got stabilised on the level of μ = 0. 38. In case of a block in its original state, stabilisation of the friction coefficient value occurred after a stage in the course of which a continuous growth of its value was observed up to the level μ = 0. 41 and then a decrease to the value μ = 0. 38. It can be assumed that occurrence of this stage was an effect of an initial running-in of the <b>friction</b> <b>couple.</b> In consecutive abrasion tests on the same <b>friction</b> <b>couple,</b> the <b>friction</b> coefficient value stabilisation occurred after the stage of a steady increase of its value.

40|$|Strong short laser pulses {{can give}} rise to a strong {{increase}} in the electronic temperature at metal surfaces. Energy transfer from the hot electrons to adsorbed molecules may result in adsorbate reactions, e. g. desorption or diffusion. We point out the limitations of an often used equation to describe the heat transfer process in terms of a <b>friction</b> <b>coupling.</b> We propose a simple theory for the energy transfer between the adsorbate and hot electrons using a newly introduced heat transfer coefficient, which depends on the adsorbate temperature. We calculate the transient adsorbate temperature and the reaction yield for a Morse potential {{as a function of the}} laser fluency. The results are compared to those obtained using a conventional heat transfer equation with temperature-independent friction. It is found that our equation of energy (heat) transfer gives a significantly lower adsorbate peak temperature, which results in a large modification of the reaction yield. We also consider the heat transfer between different vibrational modes excited by hot electrons. This mode coupling provides indirect heating of the vibrational temperature in addition to the direct heating by hot electrons. The formula of heat transfer through linear mode-mode coupling of two harmonic oscillators is applied to the recent time-resolved study of carbon monoxide and atomic oxygen hopping on an ultrafast laser-heated Pt(111) surface. It is found that the maximum temperature of the frustrated translation mode can reach high temperatures for hopping, even when direct <b>friction</b> <b>coupling</b> to the hot electrons is not strong enough...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that automobile brakes can generate {{several kinds of}} noises. Among them is squeal, a noise in the 1 - 15 kHz range. It is commonly accepted that brake squeal is initiated by instability due to the friction forces, leading to self excited vibrations. To predict the onset of brake instability, a modal analysis of the prestressed structure can be performed on an improved dynamic finite element model of ventilated disc brake with <b>friction</b> <b>coupling.</b> An unsymmetric stiffness matrix {{is a result of}} the <b>friction</b> <b>coupling</b> between the brake pad and disc; this may lead to complex eigenfrequencies. The complex eigenvalue method (Unsymmetric solver) used to analyse mode shapes associated with the predicted natural frequency. Creating the element of Matrix 27 between the ventilated disc and pad was very important in studying the squeal of the coupled ventilated disc brake. The results demonstrated that the FEM for the coupled ventilated rotor and pad showed a good interaction between the non-linear contact and the linear modal analysis. Furthermore, the unsymmetric solver showed that the modes of the coupled disc-pad contained two types of mode. The first type was normal mode, which did not contain an imaginary part while the second type was complex mode that contained real and imaginary parts. Moreover, complex eigenvalue analysis predicted always more unstable modes than the number of squeal frequencies that really occur in the brake system. The maximum squeal index was observed at mode 16 and at frequency of 4083 Hz with instability of 480 sec- 1. However; the tendency of instability (TOI) for the system at contact stiffness of 1 GN/m was 59 that gave the lowest instability of the system...|$|E
