50|$|The Wuntho sawbas {{consisted}} of {{a father and son}} team. The father, U Shwe Tha, was made Sawba of Wuntho previously in 1866 until he relinquished his position in favor of his son in 1881, U <b>Aung</b> <b>Myat.</b> Both father and son were brought up in the Burmese court and had pledged their loyalties to the Konbaung monarch. When the British occupied Mandalay, U <b>Aung</b> <b>Myat</b> thus refused to surrender. A column of 400 men was hence sent in January 1887 to Tatlwin Pass captured both U <b>Aung</b> <b>Myat</b> and U Shwe Tha. After prolonged negotiation, U <b>Aung</b> <b>Myat</b> submitted but it was merely a façade. U <b>Aung</b> <b>Myat’s</b> men still resisted and by January 1891, skirmishes broke out formerly again. Havoc broke out in the towns of Kawlin and Kyaukpintha. By this time, U Shwe Tha had retreated to Mansi. However, the overwhelming force of the British forced both father and son to find refuge in Tsanta in Yunnan province. With that, the Wuntho uprising was finally suppressed.|$|R

5000|$|Chronicles do not {{identify}} {{her by her}} personal name; they identify her simply as younger sister of Thubarit, and mother of Yazathu, Pyanchi and Gingathu.

According to the chronicle Yazawin Thit, she was Ale Pyinthe or Queen of the Central Palace, and was a grandniece of Queen Yadanabon I of Pagan. Inscriptional evidence as well as Maha Yazawin and Hmannan Yazawin chronicles say that she had the title Usaukpan, which according to Than Tun meant the chief queen. If so, Sithu II may have continued to keep the offices of the chief queen and the Queen of the Southern Palace separate.
