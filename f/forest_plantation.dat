Although the first modern agricultural exploitation dates from 1939 (Ostrovul Tãtaru), only after 1960 were large areas drained and converted, {{to the detriment of}} the wetlands. In 1991 agricultural land in the delta surpassed 100,000 hectares, and more than a third of its surface has been affected by crop cultivation, <b>forest</b> <b>plantation,</b> or pisciculture. As a result of these changes, along with the increasing pollution and eutrophication of the waters of the Danube, and decades of exploitation and poor fishing regulations, the fish population has been visibly reduced.|$|E
25|$|The {{eucalyptus}} species most planted are E. grandis, E. globulus and E. dunnii; {{they are}} used mainly for pulp mills. Approximately 80,000 ha of E. grandis situated in the departments of Rivera, Tacuarembó and Paysandú is primarily earmarked for the solid wood market, although a portion of it is used for sawlogs and plywood. The current area under commercial <b>forest</b> <b>plantation</b> is 6% of the total. The main uses of the wood produced are elemental chlorine free pulp mill production (for cellulose and paper), sawlogs, plywood and bioenergy (thermoelectric generation). Most of the products obtained from sawmills and pulp mills, as well as plywood and logs, are exported. This has raised the income of this sector with respect to traditional products from other sectors. Uruguayan forestry plantations have rates of growth of 30 cubic metres per hectare per year and commercial harvesting occurs after 9 years.|$|E

40|$|<b>Forest</b> <b>plantations</b> are a {{possible}} way of increasing forest productivity in temperate and tropical forests, and therefore also increasing above- and belowground carbon pools. In {{the context of}} climate change, monospecific plantations might become an alternative to mitigate global warming; however, their contribution to the structural complexity, complementarity, and biodiversity of forests has not been addressed. Mixed <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> can ensure that objectives of climate change mitigation are met through carbon sequestration, while also delivering anticipated ecosystem services (e. g., nutrient cycling, erosion control, and wildlife habitat). However, mixed <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> pose considerable operational challenges and research opportunities.

This study investigates the impacts of private <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> on local infrastructure and social services in rural Tanzania. We take a comparative approach involving households living in villages adjacent to private <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> and households in villages adjacent to a state-owned plantation. We use survey data from 338 households to analyze their perceptions about the impacts of the plantations on the number and quality of roads, bridges, and health centers, as well as on school enrolment and quality of education. We triangulate the results from a logistic regression model with observations of the size and quality of infrastructure and social services in the villages and with findings from focus group discussions. The results show that the private <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> have positively affected local infrastructure and social services in adjacent villages. The results suggest that large-scale private <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> can contribute to rural development in developing countries.

The results showed that differences in throughfall and stemflow between the three <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> were significant (p 120 cm than in the other forests, but the difference was not significant between E. ulmoides and V. fordii. Moreover, the difference in throughfall at stem distances 60 - 120 em was not significant between the different <b>forest</b> <b>plantations.</b> For E. uhnoides, throughfall under the peripheral crown part was 16. 1 % higher than that close to the stem. In contrast to E. uhnoides, Rmassoniana had 26 - 8 % lower throughfall under the peripheral crown part than close to the stem. No significant difference was found in throughfall for the various stem distances underneath V. fordii. Stemflow in E. ulmoides was 2 - 3 times higher than in the other forests (p < 0. 01). Interception loss accounted for 19. 9 % of gross rainfall for E. ulmoides, 20. 8 % for V. fordii and 27. 2 % for Rmassoniana.
