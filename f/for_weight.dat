5|$|However, {{problems}} arose due to {{the inability}} of contemporary naval technology to simultaneously meet the requirements <b>for</b> <b>weight,</b> speed, range and armament. On 8 April 1938 German Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, {{the commander in chief}} of the Kriegsmarine, informed the Oberkommando der Marine (German Naval High Command) that the Type 1937J design work was to be stopped, and that a further eight Type 36 destroyers were to be built instead. Although no ships of the Type 1937J were ever ordered or laid down, they influenced the later project studies: the Type 1938Ac, 1938Ad, and 1938B destroyers.|$|E

5|$|In the {{short-term}} low carbohydrate diets appear better than low fat diets <b>for</b> <b>weight</b> loss. In the long term; however, {{all types of}} low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets appear equally beneficial. A 2014 review found that the heart disease and diabetes risks associated with different diets appear to be similar. Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the obese may {{lower the risk of}} heart disease. Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight-loss. Success rates of long-term weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low, ranging from 2–20%. Dietary and lifestyle changes are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both the mother and the child. Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both obese and have other risk factors for heart disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{barn owl}} has acute hearing, with ears placed asymmetrically. This {{improves}} detection of sound position and distance {{and the bird}} does not require sight to hunt. The facial disc plays a part in this process, as is shown {{by the fact that}} with the ruff feathers removed, the bird can still locate the source in azimuth but fails to do so in elevation. Hunting nocturnally or crepuscularly, this bird can target its prey and dive to the ground, penetrating its talons through snow, grass or brush to seize small creatures with deadly accuracy. Compared to other owls of similar size, the barn owl has a much higher metabolic rate, requiring relatively more food. Weight <b>for</b> <b>weight,</b> barn owls consume more rodents—often regarded as pests by humans—than possibly any other creature. This makes the barn owl one of the most economically valuable wildlife animals for agriculture. Farmers often find these owls more effective than poison in keeping down rodent pests, and they can encourage barn owl habitation by providing nest sites.|$|E
5|$|The postcranial {{skeleton}} of Majungasaurus closely resembles those of Carnotaurus and Aucasaurus, {{the only other}} abelisaurid genera for which complete skeletal material is known. Majungasaurus was bipedal, with a long tail to balance out the head and torso, putting {{the center of gravity}} over the hips. Although the cervical (neck) vertebrae had numerous cavities and excavations (pleurocoels) to reduce their weight, they were robust, with exaggerated muscle attachment sites and ribs that interlocked for strength. Ossified tendons attached to the cervical ribs, giving them a forked appearance, as seen in Carnotaurus. All of these features resulted in a very strong and muscular neck. Uniquely, the cervical ribs of Majungasaurus had long depressions along the sides <b>for</b> <b>weight</b> reduction. The humerus (upper arm bone) was short and curved, closely resembling those of Aucasaurus and Carnotaurus. Also like related dinosaurs, Majungasaurus had very short forelimbs with four extremely reduced digits, first reported with only two very short external fingers and no claws. The hand and finger bones of Majungasaurus, like other majungasaurines, lacked the characteristic pits and grooves where claws and tendons would normally attach, and its finger bones were fused together, indicating that the hand was immobile. In 2012, a better specimen was described, showing that the lower arm was robust, though short, and that the hand contained four metatarsals and four, probably inflexible and very reduced, fingers, with small claws on the second and third finger. The phalanx formula was 1-2-2-1-0.|$|E
