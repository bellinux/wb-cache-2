25|$|Methyltestosterone and ethyltestosterone (17α-ethyltestosterone) are {{the parent}} {{structures}} of all 17α-alkylated AAS. Major 17α-alkylated AAS include the testosterone derivatives <b>fluoxymesterone,</b> metandienone (methandrostenolone), and methyltestosterone and the DHT derivatives oxandrolone, oxymetholone, and stanozolol.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it is not}} {{commonly}} used, methyltestosterone {{is one of the}} few AAS {{that remains}} available for medical use in the United States. The others are testosterone (and esters), nandrolone decanoate, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, and <b>fluoxymesterone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Methyltestosterone, {{also known}} as 17α-methyltestosterone or as 17α-methylandrost-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic, 17α-alkylated androstane steroid and a {{derivative}} of testosterone differing from it only {{in the presence of}} a methyl group at the C17α position. Close synthetic relatives of methyltestosterone include metandienone (17α-methyl-δ1-testosterone) and <b>fluoxymesterone</b> (9α-fluoro-11β-hydroxy-17α-methyltestosterone).|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used AAS in medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but {{most commonly}} testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (most commonly nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Others also available and used commonly but {{to a lesser extent}} include methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, mesterolone, and oxymetholone, as well as drostanolone propionate, metenolone (methylandrostenolone), and <b>fluoxymesterone.</b> Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; androstanolone, stanolone) and its esters are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine. Boldenone undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} common forms in which AAS are administered: oral pills; {{injectable}} steroids; creams/gels for topical application; and skin patches. Oral administration {{is the most}} convenient. Testosterone administered by mouth is rapidly absorbed, but it is largely converted to inactive metabolites, and only about one-sixth is available in active form. In order to be sufficiently active when given by mouth, testosterone derivatives are alkylated at the 17α position, e.g. methyltestosterone and <b>fluoxymesterone.</b> This modification reduces the liver's ability to break down these compounds {{before they reach the}} systemic circulation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fluoxymesterone,</b> {{sold under}} the brand names Halotestin and Ultandren among others, is a synthetic, orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and a 17α-alkylated {{derivative}} of testosterone. While there are legitimate medical uses of <b>fluoxymesterone,</b> {{it is also}} abused, leading {{to the development of}} analytical techniques by which <b>fluoxymesterone</b> doping can be identified.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fluoxymesterone</b> has an {{elimination}} half-life {{of approximately}} 9.2 hours, which is long relative {{to that of}} testosterone. In addition, unlike testosterone, <b>fluoxymesterone</b> has approximately 100% oral bioavailability, as the methyl group at the C17α position of <b>fluoxymesterone</b> inhibits hepatic metabolism by enzymatic oxidation of 17β-hydroxyl, allowing its absorption into the bloodstream for transport around the body.|$|E
5000|$|As an AAS, <b>fluoxymesterone</b> is an agonist of the {{androgen}} receptor (AR), similarly to androgens like testosterone and DHT. It is a substrate for 5α-reductase like testosterone, {{and so is}} potentiated in so-called [...] "androgenic" [...] tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland. As such, <b>fluoxymesterone</b> has a relatively high ratio of androgenic to anabolic activity, similarly to testosterone. <b>Fluoxymesterone</b> {{has been reported to}} be non-aromatizable due to steric hindrance by its C11β hydroxyl group, and hence is not considered to have a propensity for producing estrogenic effects such as gynecomastia or fluid retention. However, paradoxically, a case report of severe fluoxymesterone-induced gynecomastia exists, and gynecomastia associated with <b>fluoxymesterone</b> has also been reported in other publications. <b>Fluoxymesterone</b> is thought to possess little or no progestogenic activity. Because of the presence of its 17α-methyl group, the metabolism of <b>fluoxymesterone</b> is impeded, resulting in it being orally active, although also hepatotoxic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fluoxymesterone</b> {{has been}} found to act as a potent {{inhibitor}} of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2) (IC50 = 60-630 nM), with a potency comparable to that of the 11β-HSD2 inhibitor glycyrrhetinic acid. This unique action of <b>fluoxymesterone</b> is likely related to its 11β-hydroxyl group. 11β-HSD2 is responsible for the inactivation of the glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone (into cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone, respectively). Inhibition of 11β-HSD2 by <b>fluoxymesterone</b> may result in mineralocorticoid receptor overactivation and associated side effects such as hypertension and fluid retention, and has been hypothesized {{to be involved in the}} cardiovascular and other adverse effects of <b>fluoxymesterone.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Fluoxymesterone</b> is an androstane steroid and a 17α-alkylated {{derivative}} of testosterone (androst-4-en-17β-ol-3-one), {{and is also}} known as 9α-fluoro-11β-hydroxy-17α-methyltestosterone or as 9α-fluoro-11β-hydroxy-17α-methylandrost-4-en-17β-ol-3-one. It is testosterone with a fluorine atom at the C9α position, a hydroxyl group at the C11β position, and a methyl group at the C17α position.|$|E
50|$|Step One: The {{first step}} in the {{synthesis}} of <b>fluoxymesterone</b> is the microbiological oxidation of commercially available androstenedione (1.11) by Actinomyces; this introduces a hydroxyl group to the 11α-position (1.12), which is then oxidised to a ketone using Jones’ reagent, yielding the 3,11,17-triketone, adrenosterone (1.13). Pyrrolidine then reacts to form an enamine (1.14) by reaction with the 3α-keto group, protecting it from alkylation in a subsequent step. The regioselectivity of pyrrolidine for reaction at the 3α-position occurs inherently in the structure of adrenosterone, due to the position of the sterically bulky methyl groups. In subsequent steps, alkylation of the 17-keto group (1.14) using Grignard reagent, addition of hydride at the 11-position (1.15) and regeneration of the protected 3-keto group yields the starting material (1.16) for the final steps of the <b>fluoxymesterone</b> synthesis. This involves more standard synthetic transformations.|$|E

50|$|Vinyltestosterone, or 17α-vinyltestosterone, {{also known}} as 17α-vinylandrost-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, as well as 17α-hydroxypregna-4,20-dien-3-one, is a {{synthetic}} anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) that was never marketed. It is a relatively weak AAS. In one study, vinyltestosterone showed approximately one-third and one-fifth of the respective androgenic and anabolic activity of other AAS such as nandrolone, methyltestosterone, and ethyltestosterone in castrated male rats, whereas ethisterone showed almost no androgenic and anabolic activity (only 1/20th the anabolic potency of vinyltestosterone). Additionally, in women with metastatic breast cancer, vinyltestosterone {{was found to be}} ineffective in treating the disease (unlike other AAS such as testosterone propionate or <b>fluoxymesterone)</b> and produced little or no virilization in the women at a dosage of 100 mg intramuscularly three times per week. Aside from vinyltestosterone itself, two 19-nortestosterone derivatives of vinyltestosterone, norvinisterone (17α-vinyl-19-nortestosterone) and norgesterone (17α-vinyl-δ5(10)-19-nortestosterone), have, in contrast, been marketed. They are used as progestins for female hormonal contraception, rather than as AAS.|$|E
50|$|StepTwo: The 11α-hydroxyl of the {{starting}} material (1.16) is sulfonylated by p-toluenesulfonyl chloride; addition of trimethylamine (base) deprotonates the 11α-carbon, yielding an (E2) elimination of tosylate (pka - 5) to give olefin (1.17). Stereospecificity of reaction between olefin and hypobromous acid (HOBr) in base, N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), {{is determined by}} the formation of a bromonium intermediate; the electrophilic bromonium cation approaches the ring’s less sterically hindered α-face and is attacked by the π-electron density of the alkene. The hydroxide ion then attacks from above the ring (β-face) at the 11-carbon, resulting in a structure (1.18) by the stereospecific addition of hydroxyl and bromine across the double bond. Addition of sodium hydroxide results in deprotonation of the 11α-hydroxyl, and the subsequent structure undergoes an intramolecular SN2 epoxy ring formation. The epoxy ring of the β-epoxide (1.19) is protonated to give an oxironium ion intermediate. In a concerted process, fluoride attacks the ring’s α-face from below, as one of the two oxygen-carbon bonds is broken on the opposite face; hence regenerating the 11α-hydroxyl trans to the fluorine substituent. The resulting structure (1.20) is the androgenic steroid, <b>fluoxymesterone.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{suitability}} of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for the elucidation of <b>fluoxymesterone</b> metabolism has been evaluated. Electrospray ionization (ESI) and collision induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation in LC-MS/MS and electron impact spectra (EI) in GC-MS {{have been studied}} for <b>fluoxymesterone</b> and two commercially available metabolites.

The neutral loss scan of 20 Da (loss of HF) in LC-MS/MS has been applied for the selective detection of <b>fluoxymesterone</b> metabolites. In a positive <b>fluoxymesterone</b> doping control sample, 9 different analytes have been detected including the parent compound. Seven of these metabolites were also confirmed by GC-MS including 5 previously unreported metabolites.

40|$|Anabolic {{androgenic}} steroids (AAS) are testosterone derivatives used either clinically, in elite sports, or {{for body}} shaping {{with the goal}} to increase muscle size and strength. Clinically developed compounds and nonclinically tested designer steroids often marketed as food supplements are widely used. Despite the considerable evidence for various adverse effects of AAS use, the underlying molecular mechanisms are insufficiently understood. Here, we investigated whether some AAS, {{as a result of}} a lack of target selectivity, might inhibit 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11 β-HSD 2) -dependent inactivation of glucocorticoids. Using recombinant human 11 β-HSD 2, we observed inhibitory effects for several AAS. Whereas oxymetholone, oxymesterone, danazol, and testosterone showed medium inhibitory potential, <b>fluoxymesterone</b> was a potent inhibitor of human 11 β-HSD 2 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC 50] of 60 - 100 nM in cell lysates; IC 50 of 160 nM in intact SW- 620, and 530 nM in MCF- 7 cells). Measurements with rat kidney microsomes and lysates of cells expressing recombinant mouse 11 β-HSD 2 revealed much weaker inhibition by the AAS tested, indicating that the adverse effects of AAS-dependent 11 β-HSD 2 inhibition cannot be investigated in rats and mice. Furthermore, we provide evidence that <b>fluoxymesterone</b> is metabolized to 11 -oxofluoxymesterone by human 11 β-HSD 2. Structural modeling revealed similar binding modes for <b>fluoxymesterone</b> and cortisol, supporting a competitive mode of inhibition of 11 β-HSD 2 -dependent cortisol oxidation by this AAS. No direct modulation of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) function was observed. Thus, 11 β-HSD 2 inhibition by <b>fluoxymesterone</b> may cause cortisol-induced MR activation, thereby leading to electrolyte disturbances and contributing to the development of hypertension and cardiovascular diseas...|$|E
