25|$|At 10:12:03, JP550 {{called the}} Zagreb middle-sector {{controller}} to inform {{them that the}} aircraft was out of flight level 310. The last instructions given by Erjavec to JP550 were to call the upper-sector controller on 134.45MHz and to stop squawking the assigned squawk code. By instructing JP550 to squawk Standby, Erjavec simply released a code allocated for the middle sector. The data tag for the DC-9 would now disappear from his screen and the aircraft would become merely a point among many others. If <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> handover had been normal, the DC-9 would {{have been given a}} new code on initial contact with the upper sector controller and would have been positively identified on the upper sector screen with its flight number and altitude readout. But this had not been a normal handover because of the ill-handled co-ordination for the climb. Also, Tasić was busy with other traffic and JP550 did not immediately contact the upper-sector controller. This could have been because the frequency was busy, but the pilots might also have delayed the call for some unknown reason.|$|E

500|$|We the Kings {{planned to}} release one single per month but they grew impatient. They decided to {{dedicate}} {{two months of}} studio time to writing a new album. On September 26, 2013, We the Kings set up a crowd-funding campaign on the website IndieGoGo to record a new album with a target goal of $35,000. The band offered 12 perks to fans who could receive rewards for their contribution such as a [...] "Thank You" [...] in the album's credits section, or spending {{a day in the}} studio. While the campaign ran for 30 days, the goal was met within 24 hours. The group received $67,000 in a matter of two days and eventually received at total of $149,483 from 2,309 contributors. Initially, the group thought that this figure was an error. After being contacted, IndieGoGo confirmed the amount was correct.

The episode's opening nightmare sequence, in which Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is terrified by a clown crawling along the ceiling, was inspired by the childhood nightmares of Morgan and Wong, and left Tiplady suffering from bad dreams herself for several nights after filming. Producer John Peter Kousakis recalls having visited the episode's set late during production, having felt that make-up effects supervisor Toby Lindala had been doing [...] "fabulous" [...] work on the series' prosthetic body parts. Walking on set to find Lindala's recreation of a quartered corpse, Kousakis remarked [...] "we're doing something special here, but we're also doing something really outrageous". Lance Henriksen also found this scene too graphic to film all at once, taking time between shots to compose himself.|$|E

2500|$|The regiment's {{designation}} as the 39th Arkansas Infantry Regiment {{has caused}} problems for historians attempting {{to research the}} unit. Although John B.

[...] This is because the U.S. government used the name to catalog the service records {{of the men who}} served in the regiment. In the early 1900s, an army of War Department clerks pored over hundreds of thousands of Confederate army records, muster rolls, payrolls, quartermaster and commissary receipts, prisoner of war records, etc., and painstakingly extracted individual information from them to create a Compiled Service Record for each Confederate soldier. This monumental task {{is one of the most}} valuable services the federal government performed for researchers.

2500|$|Another wartime {{personality}} of Valenciennes was Louise de Bettignies (born in Saint-Amand-les-Eaux), a pupil of the Ursulines in Valenciennes from 1890 to 1896. Fluent in four languages (including German), in 1915 she created {{and directed the}} main British intelligence network behind enemy lines, nearly [...] from the front around Lille. Arrested {{at the end of}} September 1915, and imprisoned in Germany, she died of mistreatment in September 1918 two months before the Armistice. It is estimated that she saved the lives of nearly a thousand British soldiers by the remarkably precise information she obtained. For example, it enabled the British to conduct the first aerial bombing of a train (that of Kaiser Wilhelm II, who came to visit the front at Lille), though both aircraft were not equipped with suitable viewfinders and so the raid narrowly missed its target. The German High Command, based in Brussels, then put all its efforts into neutralising the accursed network that allowed the British to see everything and know <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> part of the front. Louise's arrest was associated with the escape of Szeck Alexandre, a young Austrian radio operator got out of Brussels in August 1915, allowing the British {{to get their hands on}} the secret German diplomatic code. This code was exploited by Secret Service Room 40 ("Room 40"), under the supervision of Sir Reginald Hall, and in January 1917 allowed the decipherment of the famous Zimmermann Telegram, which triggered the United States' entry into the war in April 1917.|$|E

[...] Casting directors suggested Evans to Bong, who initially had misconceptions of Evans before they met due to the [...] "caricature of the American all muscle", but quickly departed from that notion and described Evans as [...] " [...] he's actually very sensitive and has a quiet and introverted side. He's a very, very smart person, and he's a director." [...] Bong {{was introduced to the}} films Puncture and Sunshine where he described Evans' performances as showing his [...] "sensitive acting abilities". Bong and Evans spent months talking about the dialogue, and Bong received help from the cast and crew including Evans due to it being his first English language film. Bong said that for the role of Curtis, hiding Evans' muscular physique was the most difficult thing about working with the actor. Explaining, [...] "He's supposed to be in the poor tail section for 17 years, eating only protein blocks, and it was tricky to hide all of that muscle mass with costume and make-up." [...] On whether he was surprised by the fan response, Evans said, [...] "I've been surprised about <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> movie.
