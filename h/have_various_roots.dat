60|$|This {{aspect of}} Helvétius's doctrine, however, {{is one of}} those truths which is only valid when taken in {{connection}} with a whole group of different truths, and it was exactly that way of asserting a position, in itself neither indefensible nor unmeaning, which left the position open to irresistible attack. Helvétius's errors <b>had</b> <b>various</b> <b>roots,</b> and may be set forth in as many ways. The most general account of it is that even if he had insisted on making Self-love the strongest ingredient in our judgment of conduct, he ought at least to have given some place to Sympathy. For, though it is possible to contend that sympathy is only an indirect kind of self-love, or a shadow cast by self-love, still it is self-love so transformed as to imply a wholly different set of convictions, and to require a different name.|$|R

The background of this diversity <b>has</b> <b>various</b> <b>roots,</b> ranging from different vascular segments or areas studied {{up to the}} different age of experimental animals. Our study aimed to follow the BP as an integrated response of vascular system. This approach was justified since stabilized cardiac output in SHR was proved till 1 year of age. The groups of male SHR (aged 3, 5, 9, 17 and 52 weeks) and age-matched Wistar rats were used. Significant basal BP difference between SHR and Wistar rats was found at 9 weeks of age and continued till the age of 52 weeks, reaching 189. 6 ± 11. 9 mm Hg in SHR and 117. 3 ± 6. 9 mm Hg in Wistar rats (P< 0. 01).

40|$|Introduction: Periodontitis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease manifested as {{the destruction of}} tooth supporting tissues, which may progress to tooth loss. The chemical antimicrobial agents are often applied locally into the periodontal pocket as adjuncts to conventional mechanical periodontal therapy, but these <b>have</b> <b>various</b> adverse effects. <b>Root</b> extract of Saussurea lappa has shown anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties. Hence, {{the present study was}} aimed to assess and compare the effect of root extract of S. lappa to chlorhexidine gluconate as subgingival irrigant as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP). Materials and Methods: Thirty chronic periodontitis patients in the age group of 25 - 45 years were selected for the study. Five hundred and forty periodontal pockets were treated by three different procedures: Group 1 : Subjects treated by SRP only, Group 2 : In addition to SRP, irrigation with S. lappa extract was done and Group 3 : Chlorhexidine was used as irrigant along with SRP. Periodontal clinical recordings (modified sulcular bleeding index, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, and the presence of pus discharge) were done at 0, 7, 14, 28, and 42 days. Results: The periodontal parameters studied improved in all the three groups over the time period. In 4 - 5 mm pockets, S. lappa treated group showed significant improvement than chlorhexidine treated group. Furthermore, a dramatic decrease in periodontal pockets with pus discharge was seen in this group. Conclusion: Subgingival irrigation with S. lappa might be a promising adjunct to conventional treatment options in the management of periodontal infections...|$|R

In Filipino celebrations, lechón (also spelled litson) {{serves as the}} centerpiece of the dinner table. It is usually a whole roasted pig, but suckling pigs (lechonillo, or lechon de leche) or cattle calves (lechong baka) can also be prepared in place of the popular adult pig. It is typically served with lechon sauce, which is traditionally made from the roasted pig's liver. Other dishes include hamonado (honey-cured beef, pork or chicken), relleno (stuffed chicken or milkfish), mechado, afritada, caldereta, puchero, paella, menudo, morcon, embutido (referring to a meatloaf dish, not a sausage as understood elsewhere), suman (a savory rice and coconut milk concoction steamed in leaves such as banana), and pancit canton.
