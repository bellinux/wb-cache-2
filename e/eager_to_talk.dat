25|$|Poniatowska most {{influential}} {{work has been}} “testimonial narratives,” writings based both on historical facts and accounts by people who normally are not recorded by the media. She began writing on social issues after a visit to Lecumberri, a famous former prison, to interview several incarcerated railway workers who had gone on strike. She found prisoners <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> and share their life stories. She interviewed Subcomandante Marcos in 1994. Much of this work has been compiled into seven volumes including Todo México (1991–1999), Domingo siete (1982) and Palabras cruzadas (1961). Her best known book of this type is La noche de Tlatelolco which contains the testimonies {{of the victims of}} the 1968 student massacre in Mexico City.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for Salon magazine, Andrew O'Hehir wrote, [...] "What Soderbergh {{has sought to}} capture here is a grand process of birth and extinguishment, one that {{produced}} a complicated legacy in which John McCain, Barack Obama, and Raúl Castro are still enmeshed. There {{will be plenty of}} time to argue about the film's (or films') political relevance or lack thereof, to call Soderbergh names for this or that historical omission, for this or that ideological error. He's made something that people will be eager to see and <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about all over the world, something that feels strangely urgent, something messy and unfinished and amazing".|$|E

After their wedding, she and Lennon held a [...] "Bed-In for Peace" [...] in their honeymoon suite at the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel in March 1969, where the pair of newlyweds in pajamas invited {{visitors}} {{and members of the}} press, <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about and promote world peace.

5000|$|In 1961 {{he wrote}} New Zealand Cricketers, 50 chapters, each {{one on a}} {{prominent}} New Zealand player, past or present. An extra chapter at the beginning is about Lord Cobham, New Zealand's cricket-playing Governor-General, who had just played his last first-class game {{at the age of}} 51, while a postscript is dedicated to [...] "the below average cricketer", the dedicated but ungifted club player: [...] "Without him, the game would not survive, because it would be meaningless." [...] Having attended first-class cricket matches in New Zealand since 1928, Brittenden had watched and in most cases known personally all 50 subjects, except for the Wellington batsman J.S.

500|$|Peter Bradshaw, in {{his review}} for The Guardian, wrote, [...] "Perhaps it will even come {{to be seen as}} this director's flawed masterpiece: enthralling but {{structurally}} fractured—the second half is much clearer and more sure-footed than the first—and at times frustratingly reticent, unwilling to attempt any insight into Che's interior world". In his less favorable review for Esquire, Stephen Garrett criticized the film for failing to show Guevara's negative aspects, [...] "the absence of darker, more contradictory revelations of his nature leaves Che bereft of complexity. All that remains is a South American superman: uncomplex, pure of heart, defiantly pious and boring". Richard Corliss had problems with Del Toro's portrayal of Guevara: [...] "Del Toro—whose acting style often starts over the top and soars from there, like a hang-glider leaping from a skyscraper roof—is muted, yielding few emotional revelations, seemingly sedated here ... Che is defined less by his rigorous fighting skills and seductive intellect than by his asthma". In his review for Salon.com, Andrew O'Hehir praised Soderbergh for making [...] "something that people will be eager to see and <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about all over the world, something that feels strangely urgent, something messy and unfinished and amazing. I'd be surprised if Che doesn't win the Palme d'Or ... but be that as it may, nobody who saw it here will ever forget it".|$|E
60|$|When Dick had retraced {{his steps}} to Mansfield's {{he found no}} less than ten of the {{citizens}} there, several of whom he had already met; and all were evidently <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with the boy who had walked across Smoke Creek Desert.|$|E
6000|$|An hour later, and the gossips of the Eskimo village were {{assembled}} round Mrs Okiok's hospitable lamp--she had no [...] "board,"--the {{raised floor}} at the further end of the hut serving both for seat and table in the daytime and for bed at night.

6000|$|... "Pymantoning," [...] said Cornelia, <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> {{contribute}} something <b>to</b> the <b>talk,</b> {{and then}} vexed {{to have it}} made much of by Mr. Plaisdell.|$|R
50|$|However, {{neither side}} {{could afford the}} {{dissolution}} of talks. The Pakistani press met rumors of an end <b>to</b> negotiation with <b>talk</b> of increased hostilities; the government was ill-prepared <b>to</b> forego <b>talks</b> for a violent conflict with India {{and was forced to}} reconsider its position. India was also <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> settle the Indus issue; large development projects were put on hold by negotiations, and Indian leaders were <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> divert water for irrigation.|$|R
60|$|He {{took charge}} of Harold's affairs with ready and tactful hand. He was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> hear his story, but Harold refused <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> on any other subject than Mary. At dinner he sat in gloomy silence, {{disregarding}} his friend's pleasant, low-voiced gossip concerning old friends in Rock River.|$|R
60|$|The man's {{essential}} sturdiness {{of character}} {{came out as}} he talked, and his face lost the heavy and rather savage look it had worn at first. I had taken a seat beside him by this time and my sincere interest in his affairs seemed to please him. He was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> as one who had been {{silent for a long}} time.|$|E
6000|$|And of this, Alice {{was ready}} and <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> telling how clever and how industrious Nuttie had always been, and how great an {{advantage}} Miss Nugent's kindness was, {{and how she}} was hoping to go up for the Cambridge examination; then, detecting some doubt in her companion's manner, she said, 'It {{would be a great}} disappointment to her not to do so now. Do you think she had better not?' ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{difficult}} {{to feel sorry for}} him, his own fate appearing to make so little difference to himself. The world was still full of interest to him--not his own particular corner of it: that, he gave me to understand, he had tidied up and dismissed from his mind. It was the future, its coming problems, its possibilities, its new developments, about which he seemed <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> One might have imagined him a young man with the years before him.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Weston, however, too <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> be very observant, too {{communicative}} to want others <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> {{was very}} well satisfied with what she did say, and soon moved away to make {{the rest of his}} friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already.|$|R
60|$|As if <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> {{convince}} {{himself that}} there was no great danger to be apprehended from the journey through the forest, he continued <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about his plans until both the boys were perfectly familiar with all he hoped to gain by the attempt; but of his fears not a word was spoken.|$|R
30|$|According to 1, 242 {{respondents}} of the questionnaire, 95 % {{of caregivers}} were <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> {{send their children}} to the teaching sites, and 79 % of them thought their children had made remarkable achievements and 71 % of the total expressed that their children wish <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about what happened in the school hours (Su, 2011).|$|R
60|$|As Great Smash was an oracle {{in her own}} set, {{there was}} no gainsaying her dogmas, and Pliny the elder was obliged to succumb. But the {{presence}} of Mike, one who was understood to have been out, near, if not actually in, the enemy's camp, and a great favourite in the bargain, was a circumstance likely to revive the discourse. In fact, all the negroes, crowded into the hall, {{as soon as the}} Irishman was seated at table, one or two <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> the rest as eager to listen.|$|E
6000|$|Toff {{opened the}} door--but not with his {{customary}} alacrity. Amelius was too completely fatigued to notice any trifling circumstance. Otherwise, he {{would certainly have}} perceived something odd in the old Frenchman's withered face. He looked at his master, as he relieved him of his hat and coat, with the strangest expression of interest and anxiety; modified by a certain sardonic sense of amusement underlying the more serious emotions. [...] "A nasty dull evening," [...] Amelius said wearily. And Toff, always <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> at other times, only answered, [...] "Yes, sir"--and retreated at once to the kitchen regions.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We had dodges,' {{continued}} Constance, warming {{with the}} history of her school-days, and far too <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to think of the harm she might be doing to the younger girl. 'Sometimes, when a lot of us went to a shop with one of the governesses, one would slip out and post a letter. Fraulein was so short-sighted, she never guessed. We used to call her the jolly old Kafer. But Mademoiselle was very sharp. She once caught Alice Bell, so that she had to make an excuse and say she had dropped something. You see, she really had--the letter into the slit.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{children}} {{went off to}} gather cowslips, and Stead was able <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> it over with Patience, who at first was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> be rid of the dangerous trust, and added, with a sigh, [...] "That she had never taken the Sacrament since the Easter before poor father was killed, {{and it must be}} nigh upon Whitsuntide now." ...|$|R
50|$|He is {{also the}} first one to {{recognize}} Sophie's incredible ability <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> life into the world around her, which is the reason he allowed her into the castle {{in the first place and}} was so <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> make a bargain with her - if anyone but she were to break the contract he had with Howl, then Calcifer would die. Fortunately, she is able <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> life into him, and he survives losing Howl's heart, even deciding to continue living with them after he is freed.|$|R
60|$|When, {{however, they}} were thrown together, their {{relations}} were unchanged. Malchus was as affectionate, as respectful, and as <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> {{listen to his}} father's advice, {{as he had been}} as a boy, while Hamilcar was glad in the society of his son to forget the cares and toils of the expedition in which they had embarked and <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of the dear ones at home.|$|R
6000|$|To Jack Burns alone, plain, plodding, and slow, Harold {{showed a}} smiling face. He met {{him with a}} boyish word--"Hello, Jack! how goes it?"--and was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> He {{reached out and touched}} him with his hands wistfully. [...] "I'm glad you've come. You're the only friend I've got now, Jack." [...] This was one of the morbid fancies jail life had developed; he thought {{everybody}} had turned against him. [...] "Now, I want to tell you something--we're chums, and you mustn't give me away. These fools think I'm going to try to escape, but I ain't. You see, they can't hang me for stabbing that coward, but they'll shut me up for a year or two, and I've got to keep healthy, don't you see? When I get out o' this I strike for the West, don't you see? And I've {{got to be able to}} do a day's work. Look at this arm." [...] He stripped his strong white arm for inspection.|$|E
6000|$|Forthwith {{everyone}} {{all down}} the street, the sweetstuff seller, cocoanut shy proprietor and his assistant, the swing man, little boys and girls, rustic dandies, smart wenches, smocked elders and aproned gipsies--began running towards the inn, {{and in a}} miraculously short space of time a crowd of perhaps forty people, and rapidly increasing, swayed and hooted and inquired and exclaimed and suggested, in front of Mrs. Hall's establishment. Everyone seemed <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> at once, {{and the result was}} Babel. A small group supported Mrs. Hall, who was picked up in a state of collapse. There was a conference, and the incredible evidence of a vociferous eye-witness. [...] "O Bogey!" [...] "What's he been doin', then?" [...] "Ain't hurt the girl, 'as 'e?" [...] "Run at en with a knife, I believe." [...] "No 'ed, I tell ye. I don't mean no manner of speaking. I mean marn 'ithout a 'ed!" [...] "Narnsense! 'tis some conjuring trick." [...] "Fetched off 'is wrapping, 'e did--" ...|$|E
60|$|I think I said that. I seem to {{remember}} saying that; perhaps with other phrases that I have forgotten. But my memory of what we said and did, which is so photographically clear of these earlier passages that I believe I can answer for every gesture and nearly every word that I have set down, becomes suddenly turbid. The high tension of our first confrontation was giving place to a flood of emotional impulse. We all became <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> to impose interpretations and justifications upon our situation. We all three became divided between our partial attention {{to one another and}} our urgent necessity to keep hold of our points of view. That I think is the common tragedy of almost all human conflicts, that rapid breakdown from the first cool apprehension of an issue to heat, confusion, and insistence. I do not know if indeed we raised our voices, but my memory has an effect of raised voices, and when at last I went out of the house {{it seemed to me that}} the men-servants in the hall were as hushed as beasts before a thunderstorm, and all of them quite fully aware of the tremendous catastrophe that had come to Martens. And moreover, as I recalled afterwards with astonishment, I went past them and out into the driving rain unprotected, and not one of them stirred a serviceable hand....|$|E
50|$|Weber {{was afraid}} of too much bureaucracy. In 1912, he heard that {{officials}} of the government were working together with officials of large corporate companies. Weber {{wanted to create a}} large, left-wing, political party combining social democrats and left-wing liberals to counter the bureaucratic threat. The social democrats were willing <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with Weber, as they were <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> lose their isolation in the German society and politics. The plan failed because very few liberals prepared to help Weber.|$|R
60|$|When all the afternoon's adventures {{had been}} told, the family felt {{inclined}} to go visiting in a body, for each found something very attractive {{in the big}} house {{on the other side}} of the hedge. Mrs. March wanted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of her father with the old man who had not forgotten him, Meg longed to walk in the conservatory, Beth sighed for the grand piano, and Amy was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> see the fine pictures and statues.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I found I {{could turn}} the {{consciousness}} you created in me into literary material, and so I was rather <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> go. I have got a point for my new story out of it. I shall have my fellow suffer all I didn't suffer in meeting the girl he knows his mother wants him to marry. I got on very well with those ladies. Mrs. Andrews {{is the mother of}} innocence, but she isn't innocence. She managed <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of my story without asking about the person who wanted to anticipate the conclusion. That was what you call complex. She was insincere; {{it was the only thing}} she wanted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{had come}} up to town earlier than usual because he wished {{to be on the}} spot for legal {{consultation}} as to the arrangements of his will, the transference of mortgages, and that transaction with his uncle about the succession to Diplow, which the bait of ready money, adroitly dangled without importunity, had finally won him to agree upon. But another acceptable accompaniment of his being in town was the presentation of himself with the beautiful bride whom he had chosen to marry in spite of what other people might have expected of him. It is true that Grandcourt went about with the sense that he did not care a languid curse for any one's admiration: but this state of not-caring, just as much as desire, required its related object--namely, a world of admiring or envying spectators: for if you are fond of looking stonily at smiling persons--the persons must be and they must smile--a rudimentary truth which is surely forgotten by those who complain of mankind as generally contemptible, since any other aspect of the race must disappoint the voracity of their contempt. Grandcourt, in town {{for the first time with}} his wife, had his non-caring abstinence from curses enlarged and diversified by splendid receptions, by conspicuous rides and drives, by presentations of himself with her on all distinguished occasions. He wished her to be sought after; he liked that [...] "fellows" [...] should be <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with her and escort her within his observation; there was even a kind of lofty coquetry on her part that he would not have objected to. But what he did not like were her ways in relation to Deronda.|$|E
6000|$|To be {{sure this}} wisdom d'apres coup is easy. We wonder at this man's rashness now the deed is done, and {{marvel at the}} other's fault. What generals {{some of us are}} upon paper! what repartees come to our mind when the talk is finished! and, the game over, how well we see how it should have been played! Writing of an event at a {{distance}} of thirty years, 'tis not difficult now to criticise and find fault. But at the time when we first heard of Wolfe's glorious deeds upon the Plains of Abraham--of that army marshalled in darkness and carried silently up the midnight river--of those rocks scaled by the intrepid leader and his troops--of that miraculous security of the enemy, of his present acceptance of our challenge to battle, and of his defeat on the open plain by the sheer valour of his conqueror--we were all intoxicated in England by the news. The whole nation rose up and felt itself the stronger for Wolfe's victory. Not merely all men engaged in the battle, but those at home who had condemned its rashness, felt themselves heroes. Our spirit rose as that of our enemy faltered. Friends embraced each other when they met. Coffee-houses and public places were thronged with people <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> the news. Courtiers rushed to the King and the great Minister by whose wisdom the campaign had been decreed. When he showed himself, the people followed him with shouts and blessings. People did not deplore the dead warrior, but admired his euthanasia. Should James Wolfe's friends weep and wear mourning, because a chariot had come from the skies to fetch him away? Let them watch with wonder, and see him departing, radiant; rising above us superior. To have a friend who had been near or about him was to be distinguished. Every soldier who fought with him was a hero. In our fond little circle I know 'twas a distinction to be Harry's brother. We should not in the least wonder but that he, from his previous knowledge of the place, had found the way up the heights which the British army took, and pointed it out to his General. His promotion would follow as a matter of course. Why, even our Uncle Warrington wrote letters to bless Heaven and congratulate me and himself upon the share Harry had had in the glorious achievement. Our Aunt Beatrix opened her house and received company upon the strength of the victory. I became a hero from my likeness to my brother. As for Parson Sampson, he preached such a sermon that his auditors (some of whom had been warned by his reverence of the coming discourse) were with difficulty restrained from huzzaing the orator, and were mobbed as they left the chapel. [...] "Don't talk to me, madam, about grief," [...] says General Lambert to his wife, who, dear soul, was for allowing herself some small indulgence of her favourite sorrow on the day when Wolfe's remains were gloriously buried at Greenwich. [...] "If our boys could come by such deaths as James's, you know you wouldn't prevent them from being shot, but would scale the Abraham heights to see the thing done! Wouldst thou mind dying in the arms of victory, Charley?" [...] he asks of the little hero from the Chartreux. [...] "That I wouldn't," [...] says the little man; [...] "and the doctor gave us a holiday, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|Again, {{there is}} a very {{prevalent}} idea, that Time loves to sit by the fireside, telling stories of the Puritans, the witch persecutors, and the heroes of the old French war and the Revolution; and that he has no memory for anything more recent than the days of the first President Adams. This is another great mistake. Time is so <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of novelties, that he never fails to give circulation to the most incredible rumors of the day, though at the hazard of being compelled to eat his own words to-morrow. He shows numberless instances of this propensity while the national elections are in progress. A month ago, his mouth was full of the wonderful Whig victories; and to do him justice, he really seems to have told the truth for once. Whether the same story will hold good another year, we must leave Time himself to show. He has a good deal to say, at the present juncture, concerning the revolutionary movements in Canada; he blusters a little about the northeastern boundary question; he expresses great impatience at the sluggishness of our commanders in the Florida war; he gets considerably excited whenever the subject of abolition is brought forward, and so much the more, as he appears hardly to have made up his mind on one side or the other. Whenever this happens to be the case,--as it often does,--Time works himself into such a rage, that you would think he were going to tear the universe to pieces; but I never yet knew him to proceed, in good earnest, to such terrible extremities. During the last six or seven months, he has been seized with intolerable sulkiness at the slightest mention of the currency; for nothing vexes Time so much as to be refused cash upon the nail. The above are the chief topics of general interest which Time is just now in the habit of discussing. For his more private gossip, he has rumors of new matches, of old ones broken off, with now and then a whisper of good-natured scandal; sometimes, too, he condescends to criticise a sermon, or a lyceum lecture, or performance of the glee-club; and, to be brief, catch the volatile essence of present talk and transitory opinions, and you will have Time's gossip, word for word. I may as well add, that he expresses great approbation of Mr. Russell's vocal abilities, and means to be present from beginning to end of his next concert. It is not every singer that could keep Time with his voice and instrument, for a whole evening. Perhaps you will inquire, [...] "What are Time's literary tastes?" [...] And here again {{there is a}} general mistake. It is conceived by many, that Time spends his leisure hours at the Athenaeum, turning over the musty leaves of those large worm-eaten folios, which nobody else has disturbed since the death of the venerable Dr. Oliver. So far from this being the case, Time's profoundest studies are the new novels from Messrs. Ives and Jewett's Circulating Library. He skims over the lighter articles in the periodicals of the day, glances at the newspapers, and then throws them aside forever, all except [...] "The Salem Gazette," [...] of which he preserves a file, for his amusement a century or two hence.|$|E
60|$|He found Mrs. Septimus and Hester (who {{had been}} told--she was so safe, {{she found it}} tiring <b>to</b> <b>talk)</b> ready, and indeed <b>eager,</b> <b>to</b> discuss the news. It was very good of dear Soames, they thought, to employ Mr. Bosinney, but rather risky. What had George named him? 'The Buccaneer' How droll! But George was always droll! However, {{it would be all}} in the family they {{supposed}} they must really look upon Mr. Bosinney as belonging to the family, though it seemed strange.|$|R
6000|$|She {{went down}} {{again into the}} parlor, <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> talk--no matter how idly, no matter on what trifles. The room was empty.

60|$|The legal gentleman {{was not as}} <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> {{lead the}} way as he was to urge the men on, and instead of going boldly up to Bob, he tried to induce his men to go in.
