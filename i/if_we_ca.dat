In traditional telecommunication systems, each UE will be basically served by only one base station (BS) at a moment. Signals come from other BS's will become interference to the UE. When the UE moves to the cell edge, it will communicate with more than one BS's to prepare for handover. However, it is still being served by its original BS. This is also the time when the UE receives strong interference, and data rate will be very low. The situation will become worse if the UE is moving with high speed.|$|R
40|$|Using robots with {{industrial}} welding {{operations is}} common, {{but far from}} being a solved technological process. The problems are with the robots (still in early stages, difficult to use and program by regular operators), the welding process (complex and not really well known) and the Human-Machine interfaces (non natural, really not working). In this paper we discuss these problems and present a system designed with the double objective of serving our R&D efforts on welding applications, but also our need to assist industrial partners working with welding setups. The system is explained in some detail, and demonstrated using two test cases which reproduce two situations very common in industry: multi-layer butt welding (used on big structures requiring very strong welds) and multi-point fillet welding (used for example on structural pieces for the construction industry). <b>If</b> <b>we</b> flash remember the long history of robotics {{there are a few things}} <b>we</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|R

Here, gesture image is taken from Web camera and image will be {{processed}} in remote interface using MATLAB controller. But, the challenging problem is that capturing the image from external device {{does not depend on}} unique only and Identification of the exact action from an unclear image is not an easy task. Hence, capturing action from the images is always puzzling task of separating different sources of images when its different or noisy. Finally, the images are forwarded to MATLAB to compare the images with our knowledge database via three dimension (x, y, and z) readings of a particular object. So <b>if</b> <b>we</b> move any object in any direction then the corresponding values are noted by the accelerometer. Most of the music players are controlled through the remote controls which contain buttons. But through embedding the PIC 16 F 8779 controller, <b>we</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|R
