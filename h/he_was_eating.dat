25|$|Brabham {{made his}} last public {{appearance}} on 18 May 2014, appearing {{with one of}} the cars he built. He died at his home on the Gold Coast on 19 May 2014, aged 88, following a lengthy battle with kidney or liver disease. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>eating</b> breakfast with his wife, Margaret, when he died. In a statement on the family's website, Brabham's son David confirmed his father's death.|$|E
25|$|Horne did {{not recover}} his {{physical}} health. Mann writes that {{he continued to}} go on countless hunger strikes in prison without any cohesive strategy and with little support. It {{got to the point}} where no one apart from the guards knew whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>eating</b> or not. He embarked on his final hunger strike on 21 October 2001, and died 15 days later of liver failure. He had signed a directive refusing medical treatment, and was regarded by psychiatrists as of sound mind, which caused the prison authorities not to intervene.|$|E
25|$|A Jefferson County Sheriff's Deputy, Neil Gardner, was {{assigned}} to the high school as a full-time uniformed and armed school resource officer. Gardner usually ate lunch with students in the cafeteria, but on April 20 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>eating</b> lunch in his patrol car at the northwest corner of the campus, watching students in the Smokers' Pit in Clement Park. The security staff at Columbine did not observe the bombs being placed in the cafeteria, since a custodian was replacing the school security video tape as it happened. The bags holding the bombs were first visible on the fresh security tape, but they were not identified as suspicious items. No witness recalled seeing the duffel bags being added to the 400 or so backpacks already in the cafeteria.|$|E

25|$|I {{was often}} {{asked if he}} had cancer or AIDS. In fact at 67, he had diabetes, some rheumatism, the odd creaky joint, a healthy {{capacity}} to whinge and the usual symptoms connected with smoking and drinking. But by now the horses were gone and the dog had died. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>eating</b> less and drinking more. One night, he fell down the stairs. He was discovered the next morning on the floor by his housekeeper. He was rushed to the local hospital where pneumonia in one lung was treated effectively and efficiently, a fracture near his hip was repaired and he was diagnosed with brain damage. We were to learn he had Korsakoff's syndrome (an alcohol-related condition) and we decided to keep it private.|$|E
25|$|Cooke {{also participated}} in the Gettysburg Campaign with Stuart. Soon {{after the start of}} the Stuart's ride around the Union Army of the Potomac, Cooke was nearly shot or {{captured}} during the Battle of Fairfax Court House (June 1863). <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>eating</b> breakfast with two other staff officers and a courier at the home of a blacksmith while the blacksmith shoed their horses. The Confederate officers were about a half mile from the main body of Brig. Gen. Wade Hampton III's cavalry division when advance riders from the 11th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry rode by in pursuit of the advance guard of Hampton's division. The other three Confederates quickly fled toward their main body but Cooke was intent on finishing his breakfast and having his horse shoed. He barely escaped when a second group of Union riders became suspicious of the nature of activity at the farm and rode up to check.|$|E
500|$|At {{some time}} during the night of 24/25 November 1974, Nick Drake died at his home ("Far Leys") in Tanworth-in-Arden, from an {{overdose}} of amitriptyline, a type of antidepressant. He {{had gone to bed}} early after spending the afternoon visiting a friend. His mother said that around dawn he left his room for the kitchen. His family was used to hearing him do this many times before but, during this instance, he did not make a sound. They presumed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>eating</b> a bowl of cereal. He returned to his room a short while later, and took some pills [...] "to help him sleep".|$|E

500|$|In May 2010, The Hollywood Reporter {{said the}} actors {{who met with}} Webb to be {{considered}} for the lead role included Jamie Bell, Alden Ehrenreich, Frank Dillane, Ose Hayble, Garfield and [...] Josh Hutcherson. In June 2010 the Los Angeles Times reported that the shortlist had expanded to include Aaron Johnson and Anton Yelchin. At least Bell, Ehrenreich, Garfield, Yelchin, Logan Lerman and Michael Angarano had screen tests. On July 1, 2010, the choice of Garfield was confirmed. Webb stated that he felt he knew Garfield was the right guy when they were filming a cutscene where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>eating</b> a cheeseburger while telling Gwen to calm down.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, EGV Entertainment, a {{movie theater}} {{operator}} in Thailand, opened the EGV Drive-in Cafe in Bangkok, explicitly modeling the restaurant after the Sci-Fi Dine-In. Wichai Poolwaraluk, the company's executive {{president and chief executive}} officer, visited the Sci-Fi Dine-In in 2000, and was inspired to open a similar restaurant. He said that, while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>eating</b> at the Sci-Fi Dine-In, the other guests seemed more interested in their food than in the film clips on the screen, and he therefore considered the Sci-Fi Dine-In more of a restaurant than a theater, with the film reel simply being a gimmick. Appealing to EGV's identity as {{a movie theater}} operator, Poolwaraluk said that the EGV Drive-in Cafe [...] "can probably do a better job blending the cinema and the food together and also concentrate on both of them". Like the Sci-Fi Dine-In, the EGV Drive-in Cafe features classic cars for seating, but, instead of showing film clips on a loop, the EGV Drive-in Cafe shows entire short films.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in 1907, the United States Food and Drug Administration began {{investigating}} saccharin as {{a result}} of the Pure Food and Drug Act. Harvey Wiley, then the director of the bureau of chemistry for the FDA, viewed it as an illegal substitution of a valuable ingredient (sugar) by a less valuable ingredient. In a clash that had career consequences, Wiley told President Theodore Roosevelt, [...] "Everyone who ate that sweet corn was deceived. He thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>eating</b> sugar, when in point of fact <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>eating</b> a coal tar product totally devoid of food value and extremely injurious to health." [...] But Roosevelt himself was a consumer of saccharin, and, in a heated exchange, Roosevelt angrily answered Wiley by stating, [...] "Anybody who says saccharin is injurious to health is an idiot." [...] The episode proved the undoing of Wiley's career.|$|E

2500|$|In another interview, Marasigan said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>eating</b> in SM Megamall, a local {{shopping}} mall, when {{he heard}} of the news. He said he was [...] "semi-surprised" [...] and wondered if Zabala already knew about it. Adoro told of the story now famous among Eraserheads fans about Buendia's cryptic text message. He said Buendia stated in the text message that he had already [...] "graduated." [...] Adoro quipped in the same interview that it was natural for Buendia to graduate first, since he was in batch '87 of their college (UP Diliman), while the rest were in batch '88.|$|E
2500|$|At 5:15a.m., Richardson's brigade fired a few {{artillery}} rounds across Mitchell's Ford on the Confederate right, some {{of which}} hit Beauregard's headquarters in the Wilmer McLean house as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>eating</b> breakfast, alerting him {{to the fact that}} his offensive battle plan had been preempted. Nevertheless, he ordered demonstration attacks north toward the Union left at Centreville. Bungled orders and poor communications prevented their execution. Although he intended for Brig. Gen. Richard S. Ewell to lead the attack, Ewell, at Union Mills Ford, was simply ordered to [...] "hold ... in readiness to advance at a moment's notice". Brig. Gen. D.R. Jones was supposed to attack in support of Ewell, but found himself moving forward alone. Holmes was also supposed to support, but received no orders at all.|$|E
2500|$|On December 8, 1957, Young {{appeared}} with Billie Holiday, Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster, Roy Eldridge, and Gerry Mulligan in the CBS television special The Sound of Jazz, performing Holiday's tune [...] "Fine and Mellow." [...] It was a reunion with Holiday, {{with whom he}} had lost contact over the years. She was also in physical decline, near the end of her career, yet they both gave moving performances. Young's solo was brilliant, considered by many jazz musicians an unparalleled marvel of economy, phrasing and extraordinarily moving emotion. By this time his alcoholism had cumulative effect. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>eating</b> significantly less, drinking more and more, and suffering from liver disease and malnutrition. Young's sharply diminished physical strength in the final two years of his life yielded some recordings with a frail tone, shortened phrases, and, on rare occasions, a difficulty in getting any sound to come out of his horn at all.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally, Mathman did {{not play}} the game himself, making Mr. Glitch the contestant. If he {{answered}} incorrectly, <b>he</b> would <b>be</b> <b>eaten</b> by Mathman (or on one occasion, Mathman's dog Mathdog). Interestingly, on one occasion, Mr. Glitch got away with an incorrect answer, but on the second incorrect answer, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>eaten</b> by a giant Mathman.|$|R

2500|$|Often {{compared}} to American pop-rock band Maroon 5, CNBLUE {{has found the}} comparisons [...] "honorable", but has expressed its desire to distinguish its musical color and establish a unique sound. In CNBLUE's previous albums, Jung made {{a conscious effort to}} record music in order to receive recognition for it as an idol band. After deciding to disregard those notions, he opted to create [...] "more comfortable" [...] music that suited the band; as a result, the acoustic music which was present in the band's previous albums was entirely excluded from 2gether. In developing the record, CNBLUE set out to [...] "really [...] together with our music, working with each other on the compositions". CNBLUE took the initiative to change the sound of its music for a [...] "more mainstream feel" [...] by integrating elements of electronic dance music into the album. The title of the album was conceived by Jung while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>eating</b> patbingsu with bassist Lee. It signifies CNBLUE's second studio album, as well as enjoyment of the band's music together. The album was recorded in Seoul at the FNC Entertainment Studio. Mixing took place there, as well as at Cube Studio and MasterPiece SoundLab; it was mastered at the SUONO Mastering Studio.|$|E
2500|$|FBI Special Agent James P. Hosty and Dallas Police Captain Will Fritz (chief of homicide) {{conducted}} the first interrogation of Oswald on Friday, November 22. When Oswald {{was asked to}} account for himself {{at the time of}} the assassination, he replied that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>eating</b> his lunch in the first-floor lounge (known as the [...] "domino room"). He said that he then went to the second-floor lunchroom to buy a Coca-Cola from the soda machine there and was drinking it when he encountered Dallas motorcycle policeman Marrion L. Baker, who had entered the building with his gun drawn. Oswald said that while he was in the domino room, he saw two [...] "Negro employees" [...] walking by, one he recognized as [...] "Junior" [...] and a shorter man whose name he could not recall. Junior Jarman and Harold Norman confirmed to the Warren Commission that they had [...] "walked through" [...] the domino room around noon during their lunch break. When asked if anyone else was in the domino room, Norman testified that somebody else was there, but he could not remember who it was. Jarman testified that Oswald was not in the domino room when he was there. During his last interrogation on November 24, according to postal inspector Harry Holmes, Oswald was again asked where he was {{at the time of the}} shooting. Holmes (who attended the interrogation at the invitation of Captain Will Fritz) said that Oswald replied that he was working on an upper floor when the shooting occurred, then went downstairs where he encountered Dallas motorcycle policeman Marrion L. Baker.|$|E
