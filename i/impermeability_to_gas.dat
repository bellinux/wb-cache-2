30|$|Ever {{since the}} {{discovery}} of graphene [1], research on graphene, a flat monolayer of carbon atoms arranged in a two-dimensional (2 D) honeycomb lattice [2], has progressed rapidly. Due to the relatively simple and cheap procedures to obtain high-quality graphene [3] and its outstanding properties such as high electron mobility at room temperature [4], high intrinsic mechanical strength [5], high thermal conductivity [6], and complete <b>impermeability</b> <b>to</b> <b>gas</b> [7], graphene can be exploited {{in a variety of}} fields like electronics, photonics, energy generation and storage, sensor, and bio applications [3]. So far, many methods to obtain graphene have been developed, including mechanical cleavage of graphite [1], chemical exfoliation [8 – 10], epitaxial growth [11, 12], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [13 – 16], and solid-phase method [17 – 23].|$|E
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the Department of Chemical and Process Engineering for the MSc in Polymer TechnologyIsobutylene Isoprene Rubber (IIR) which {{is also known as}} Butyl Rubber is widely used in tire inner tubes & curing membranes due to its unique properties: <b>impermeability</b> <b>to</b> <b>gas</b> & stability at elevated temperatures respectively. Due to comparatively low unsaturation. Butyl Rubber is known to be cure incompatible with general purpose rubber. Therefore, preparation of co-vulcanizable blends of Butyl Rubber is not usually recommended. Pneumatic tire sidewall is subjected to cyclic dynamic deformation under various weather conditions. Among pneumatic tires, agricultural tires are supposed to be used under severe weather conditions especially during soil preparation. On top ofthat, sidewalls of agricultural tires do possess larger surface area which will be in contact with severe weather conditions. Being agricultural tires are expensive, those tires are supposed to be re-capped at least three times during the life span.

Due to strong intermolecular forces PVA has {{high mechanical strength}} (tensile strength B > 80 MPa), though small deformability (elongation at break B < 5 %). The last one is considered as the constitutive drawback of polymers, which are intended to use for films preparation. PVA plasticizing by hydroxyl groups containing mostly low-molecular substances (glycerol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol etc.) is recognized trend of weakening of too high intermolecular interaction. Development of PVA blends with another more deformable polymeric counter component could turn out efficient. Poly (vinyl acetate) (PVAc) was chosen as a counter component...|$|R
30|$|Interest in {{some kinds}} of fuel cell {{technologies}} dropped owing to economic factors, material problems, and certain inadequacies {{in the operation of}} electrochemical devices [49]. One of the main drawbacks of the fuel cells is related {{to the use of the}} liquid electrolyte. Using a polymer membrane as an electrolyte can solve some limiting requirements of fuel cells. For instance the essentially need for using pure fuels in AFCs have been overcome by using a polymer membrane as an electrolyte [14, 15]. Fuel cell membranes must meet several desired properties such as high proton conductivity, low electronic conductivity, <b>impermeability</b> <b>to</b> fuel <b>gas</b> or liquid, good mechanical toughness in both the dry and hydrated states, and high oxidative and hydrolytic stability in the actual fuel cell environment [4]. These properties are related to properties such as ion exchange capacity, morphology and water uptake that must be assessed as well when characterizing potential of a new fuel cell membrane [9].|$|R
40|$|Polyisobutylene (PIB) is a polymer {{well known}} for its {{desirable}} properties such as high chemical stability, <b>impermeability</b> <b>to</b> <b>gases,</b> and biocompatibility in certain applications. However in some applications it is limited by properties such as high hydrophobicity, lack of chemical functionalities, and the adsorption of proteins and organisms to its surface. Butyl rubber (IIR) is a copolymer of isobutylene (IB) with small percentages of isoprene (IP). Typically these IP units serve as sites for the covalent cross-linking of the IIR, in addition can serve as sites for further functionalization of IIR. These modifications can expand the potential applications of IIR. This thesis describes the development of different approaches to obtain both the attractive properties of the starting material in addition to new properties arising from its further modification. For example, antibacterial IIR surfaces were prepared using hyperthermal hydrogen induced cross-linking (HHIC) {{as a mean to}} covalently attach antibacterial polymers to the IIR surface. The antibacterial properties of the modified surfaces were investigated against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, using a synthetic method allowing for the clean modification of the double bonds of IIR and the grafting of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) chains along the polymer backbone, a library of linear PIB-PEO graft copolymers (lin-PIB-g-PEO) was successfully generated containing up to 83 wt% PEO content. The properties of the resulting graft copolymers were studied both on surfaces and in solution. These studies were further extended to generate arborescent PIB-PEO graft copolymers (arb-PIB-g-PEO) with the aim of comparing the effect of architectures on the properties of the PIB-PEO graft copolymers. Finally, a UV-cross-linkable IIR was synthesized by chemical modification of IIR backbones with cinnamate moieties. The physical and mechanical properties of the resulting UV-cured IIR polymers were studied...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The present work {{presents}} a packaging system that slows down the degrading and ageing processes of bakery products {{as well as}} mould appearance. There have been selected three packing methods: the packing in PE folio, PP folio, PP punched folio and the packing in a small bag specially designed to preserve bakery products. The selection has been done function of physical – mechanic and chemical properties of the packaging materials {{and according to the}} requirements of a good preservation of the packed product. The PE folio has a good mechanical resistance, a good permeability <b>to</b> <b>gases</b> and a high <b>impermeability</b> <b>to</b> water vapors. The PP folio has a greater contraction, a better transparency and better mechanical properties than the polyethylene. The permeability <b>to</b> water and <b>gas</b> vapors is lower than that of the polyethylene. The complex material based on textile / PE has superior physical and chemical properties and a high <b>impermeability</b> <b>to</b> moisture, <b>gas</b> and flavors. The experimental bread packaging methods prove a tight link among the permeability to water vapors, the duration of the product freshness and the mould appearance. The specially designed small bag made of two cotton lays and one polyethylene lay preserves the freshness of sliced bread, because the bread does not get dry or wet. After a 7 -day storage period, the contamination degree with Penicillium frequetans of the sample packed in PP punched folio is of 5 %. The contamination degree with Penicillium nigricans and frequetans of the sample packed in PP folio is of 85 %.

40|$|The {{relentless}} {{increase in}} the demand for useable power from energy-hungry economies continues to drive energy-material related research. Fuel cells, as a future potential power source that provide clean-at-the-point-of-use power offer many advantages such as high efficiency, high energy density, quiet operation, and environmental friendliness. Critical to {{the operation of the}} fuel cell is the proton exchange membrane (polymer electrolyte membrane) responsible for internal proton transport from the anode to the cathode. PEMs have the following requirements: high protonic conductivity, low electronic conductivity, <b>impermeability</b> <b>to</b> fuel <b>gas</b> or liquid, good mechanical toughness in both the dry and hydrated states, and high oxidative and hydrolytic stability in the actual fuel cell environment. Water soluble polymers represent an immensely diverse class of polymers. In this comprehensive review the initial focus is on those members of this group that have attracted publication interest, principally: chitosan, poly (ethylene glycol), poly (vinyl alcohol), poly (vinylpyrrolidone), poly (2 -acrylamido- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanesulfonic acid) and poly (styrene sulfonic acid). The paper then considers in detail the relationship of structure to functionality in the context of polymer blends and polymer based networks together with the effects of membrane crosslinking on IPN and semi IPN architectures. This is followed by a review of pore-filling and other impregnation approaches. Throughout the paper detailed numerical results are given for comparison to today’s state-of-the-art Nafion® based materials...|$|R

The ideal membrane should be as thin as possible to maximize flux, mechanically robust to prevent fracture, and have well-defined pore sizes to increase selectivity. Graphene is an excellent starting point for developing size selective membranes because of its atomic thickness, high mechanical strength, relative inertness, and <b>impermeability</b> <b>to</b> all standard <b>gases.</b> However, pores that can exclude larger molecules, but allow smaller molecules to pass through have to be introduced into the material. Here we show UV-induced oxidative etching can create pores in micrometre-sized graphene membranes and the resulting membranes used as molecular sieves. A pressurized blister test and mechanical resonance is used to measure the transport of a variety of gases (H 2, CO 2, Ar, N 2, CH 4, and SF 6) through the pores.

Recombinant epsilon folded in this manner inhibits the ATPase activity of soluble and membrane-bound CF 1 deficient in epsilon and restores proton <b>impermeability</b> <b>to</b> thylakoid membranes reconstituted with CF 1 deficient in epsilon.

Recombinant epsilon with six amino acids deleted from the C terminus, which is the only region of significant mismatch between the epsilon of spinach and the epsilon of Pisum sativum, inhibits ATPase activity with a reduced potency similar to that of purified pea epsilon.
