40|$|Normally, an {{economical}} {{and effective}} design of web plat girder requires thin webs. However, thin and very slender web plat girder will cause it to buckle. Corrugated web girder or Trapezoidal Web Plate (TWP) is used to overcome this situation. This project aims to produce a finite element model and studying the web profile of the beam by using LUSAS Modeller 14. 0. There were three model produced to be analyse in this project. The dimension of each model are 1500 mm x 200 mm x 900 mm. Each model is simply supported with fixed support and pinned support. The type of mesh used for each model is Quadrilateral Thin Shell with 8 nodes (QSL 8). LUSAS, Modeller 14. 0 finite element software is {{able to carry out}} linear analysis to determine deformed mesh, maximum stress and strain under axial load. Besides, critical buckling load can be predicted under the linear buckling analysis. The results show that the TWP 2 has highest strength compared to TWP 1 and Flat Web beam. The results also show that TWP of web can sustain higher buckling load compared to Flat Web girder. <b>Error!</b> <b>Bookmark</b> <b>not</b> defmed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceInformation evaluation, the {{fundamental}} {{theme of this}} book, {{is by no means}} a new idea, and is profitably used in a number of domains (physical, economical, biological, demographical and many more). Yet the establishment of a method, and the attempt to establish a certain rigor of this practice as part of an overall process, are, without a doubt, attributable to the domain of Defense. The origin of information, as well as its content, plays a crucial role both in a strategic and tactical context. Far from being reserved to espionage or data encoding, information evaluation is quite rightly considered to be an essential step in the preparation of a maneuver, the understanding of a situation in a theater of operations, or the making of a decision at a politico-strategic level. In this chapter, we begin by presenting the doctrinesError! <b>Bookmark</b> <b>not</b> <b>defined.</b> in force regarding information evaluation (which does not necessarily mean that they reflect the real-world uses and practices of military intelligence personnel). Then, from a purely conceptual point of view, we hold up some of the shortcomings of these definitions and their associated underlying uses. These various theoretical difficulties could potentially cause very damaging practical consequences, in that they make any attempt at information evaluation impossible and, therefore, may have repercussions throughout the process of which information evaluation is a part. These open-ended issues, which are by no means exhaustive, will serve us in putting Chapter written by Philippe CAPET and Adrien REVAULT D'ALLONNES...|$|R
