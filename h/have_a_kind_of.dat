500|$|Joseph Schumpeter was an {{economist}} {{of the same}} age as Keynes and one of his main rivals. He was among the first reviewers to argue that Keynes's General Theory was not a general theory, but in fact a special case. He said the work expressed [...] "the attitude of a decaying civilisation". After Keynes's death Schumpeter wrote a brief biographical piece Keynes the Economist – on a personal level he was very positive about Keynes as a man, praising his pleasant nature, courtesy and kindness. He assessed some of Keynes's biographical and editorial work as among the best he'd ever seen. Yet Schumpeter remained critical about Keynes's economics, linking Keynes's childlessness to what Schumpeter saw as an essentially short term view. He considered Keynes to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> unconscious patriotism that caused him to fail to understand the problems of other nations. For Schumpeter [...] "Practical Keynesianism is a seedling which cannot be transplanted into foreign soil: it dies there and becomes poisonous as it dies." ...|$|E

Hoppe {{emphasizes}} that Hayek, which for him is from the English empirical tradition, is an opponent of the supposed rationalist tradition of the Austrian School. However, Carl Menger made strong critiques to rationalism in his works, in similar vein as Hayek's. He emphasized the idea that there are several institutions which were not deliberately created, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> [...] "superior wisdom" [...] and serve important functions to society.

2500|$|The {{northern}} screech-owls {{are found}} in eastern states, such as New Jersey and New York. The screech owls are named for their piercing calls. The normal territorial call is not a hoot as with some owls, but a trill consisting of more than 4 individual calls per second given in rapid succession (although the sound does not resemble screeching or screaming). They also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> [...] "song" [...] which is used in courtship and, as a duet, between members of a pair. Calls differ widely between species in type and pitch, and {{in the field are}} often the first indication of these birds' presence, as well as the most reliable means to distinguish between species. The distinctness of many species of screech owls was first realized when vastly differing calls of externally similar birds from adjacent regions were noted.|$|E

The screech owls on the other hand are named for their piercing trills of more than four individual notes per second and as noted above they also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> song, which is absent in the scops owls.
