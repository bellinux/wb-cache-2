25|$|The kinetic {{process of}} destabilisation can be rather long (up to several {{months or even}} years for some products) and it is often {{required}} for the <b>formulator</b> to use further accelerating methods in order to reach reasonable development time for new product design. Thermal methods are the most commonly used and consists in increasing temperature to accelerate destabilisation (below critical temperatures of phase inversion or chemical degradation). Temperature affects not only the viscosity, but also interfacial tension in the case of non-ionic surfactants or more generally interactions forces inside the system. Storing a dispersion at high temperatures enables to simulate real life conditions for a product (e.g. tube of sunscreen cream in a car in the summer), but also to accelerate destabilisation processes up to 200 times.|$|E

The third type of poisoning is a long-term low-level exposure, which individuals are exposed to from sources such as pesticide residues in food as well as contact with pesticide residues in the air, water, soil, sediment, food materials, plants and animals.|$|R

40|$|The {{formulation}} of {{personal care products}} involves a trial-and-error approach to testing different combinations of chemicals. Specific knowledge {{plays an important role}} in creating the desired product properties. Without knowledge support tools, the formulation process becomes iterative. Furthermore, personal care products cannot be designed without analyzing market needs, and their development thus involves the collaboration of the <b>formulators</b> and the marketing teams. Miscommunication can reduce the efficiency and effectiveness of the process. This paper presents a knowledge-based ingredient formulation system for supporting chemical product development in the personal care industry. Case-based reasoning is used to solve ingredient formulation problems with reference to how similar past problems have been solved. The system also acts as a collaborative platform for sharing knowledge among the various stakeholders. A case study confirms the viability of the system, and the results show that the system provides <b>formulators</b> with key knowledge, enabling effective product formulation.
