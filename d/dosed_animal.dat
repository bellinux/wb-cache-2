40|$|The acute oral {{toxicity}} test seeks to estimate the dose at which 50 % of the organisms in adefined population will die (LD 50) after exposure to a test material. The statistical basis for the classicstudy design was first described in the 1920 s and remained in use until current times. In this test,groups of animals were administered varying doses of test material, and a <b>dosed</b> <b>animal</b> either lived ordied. As the dose in an acute {{toxicity test}} is increased, {{the probability that a}} given animal diesincreases. These results established a relationship between dose and response. Responses in an acutetoxicity study can be characterized by a mean (the LD 50) and variance(or slope) of the dose-response curve. Over the years many {{attempts have been made to}} expand test outputs and to adjust statisticalsampling so as to minimize the number of animals used and decrease their pain and suffering. Thesechanges in sampling technique do not involve any change in the actual treatment of the animals or thelethal endpoint of the test. Over the years, the classic LD 50 protocol has been modified to reduce thenumber of animals from scores of animals to 15 to 30 per study. Other modifications include suchthings as: 1.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) is an {{autosomal}} recessive disease with symptoms that include ketoacidosis, lethargy, recurrent vomiting, dehydration, respiratory distress, muscular hypotonia and death due to methylmalonic acid levels that {{are up to}} 1000 -fold greater than normal. CblB MMA, {{a subset of the}} mutations leading to MMA, is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme cob(I) alamin adenosyltransferase (ATR). No animal model currently exists for this disease. ATR functions within the mitochondria matrix in the final conversion of cobalamin into coenzyme B(12), adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl). AdoCbl is a required coenzyme for the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM). METHODS: The human ATR cDNA was cloned into a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector and packaged into AAV 2 or 8 capsids and delivered by portal vein injection to C 57 /Bl 6 mice at a dose of 1 x 10 (10) and 1 x 10 (11) particles. Eight weeks post-injection RNA, genomic DNA and protein were then extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: Using primer pairs specific to the cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer/chicken beta-actin (CBAT) promoter within the rAAV vectors, genome copy numbers were found to be 0. 03, 2. 03 and 0. 10 per cell in liver for the rAAV 8 low dose, rAAV 8 high dose and rAAV 2 high dose, respectively. Western blotting performed on mitochondrial protein extracts demonstrated protein levels were comparable to control levels in the rAAV 8 low dose and rAAV 2 high <b>dose</b> <b>animals</b> and 3 - to 5 -fold higher than control levels were observed in high <b>dose</b> <b>animals.</b> Immunostaining demonstrated enhanced transduction efficiency of hepatocytes to over 40 % in the rAAV 8 high <b>dose</b> <b>animals,</b> compared to 9 % and 5 % transduction in rAAV 2 high dose and rAAV 8 low <b>dose</b> <b>animals,</b> respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the feasibility of efficient ATR gene transfer to the liver as a prelude to future gene therapy experiments...|$|R

Two groups of female Sprague-Dawley rats were given a chronic dose of 3 mg APT weekly for 10 weeks either by intravenous (iv) tail vein or by intragastric (ig) route, A third group was given a weekly dose of 6 mg of APT for 3 weeks by the ig route corresponding to acute dosing. Both chronic iv and ig <b>dosed</b> <b>animals</b> showed ischemic tubular necrosis in the kidney but only iv <b>dosed</b> <b>animals</b> developed adenocarcinomas of the mammary glands.

40|$|We {{recently}} developed an animal model {{in order to}} study the pulmonary and systemic reactions following exposure to environmental pollutants. In this model, conscious sheep received repeated intratracheal instillations of a suspension of 0 (controls), 2 mg (low dose) or 128 mg (high dose) of chrysotile asbestos fibres over a 12 month period. A significant dose-dependent enhancement in proliferative responses of pulmonary free airway cells (FAC) to four mitogens was observed after a first instillation. A somewhat weaker stimulation was also observed in peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes (PBML). At 6 months, the high <b>dose</b> <b>animals</b> no longer displayed the dose-dependent enhancement of FAC responses and manifested actual depression of PBML responses. At 12 months, all asbestos exposed animals showed impaired responses of FAC, whereas only the PBML of high <b>dose</b> <b>animals</b> were showing such an impairment. These data suggest that asbestos exposure has a dose-dependent initial enhancement of local pulmonary as well as systemic responses to mitogens while prolonged exposure and higher doses can subsequently lead to a relative depression of local and systemic cellular immune activity. Although responsive early after asbestos exposure, systemic immunity appears to lag behind local immunity in the late depressive effect of asbestos fibres on mitogen responsiveness. In addition to these cell-directed effects serum factors seem to play an inhibitory role in lymphocyte responses to mitogens in animals repeatedly exposed to asbestos...|$|R

HIV was subsequently isolated from all animals, indicating failure of the vaccination to protect against HIV infection. Serum antibody responses were evaluated before immunization, {{at the time of}} challenge with HIV, and at multiple time points in the 9 mo after challenge.

In the present study, we sought to define the cellular and humoral factors, responsible for the observed effects. The early enhancement of peripheral blood and pulmonary lymphocyte responses to mitogens may be due, at least in part, to the loss of the inhibitory capacity of alveolar macrophages from asbestos exposed animals to suppress lymphocyte response. Furthermore, macrophages from low <b>dose</b> exposed <b>animals</b> actually enhanced lymphocytes responses to Con A and PHA.
