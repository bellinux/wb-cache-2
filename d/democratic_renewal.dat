50|$|Early {{parliamentary}} elections {{were held in}} Greece on 8 April 1990. The conservative New Democracy party of Constantine Mitsotakis, was elected, defeating the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) of Andreas Papandreou. In {{order to be able}} to command a majority of 151 in the 300-seat Parliament, New Democracy had to secure the support of Theodoros Katsikis, <b>Democratic</b> <b>Renewal's</b> sole MP. Shortly after Mitsotakis was given a confidence vote, Supreme Special Court, after a mistake in seat calculation was detected, gave New Democracy a 152nd seat.|$|R

After three consecutive wide wins with high vote percentages, Mitsotakis became the 178th Prime Minister of Greece, though with a slim parliamentary majority of 152 seats due to the electoral law in force at the time.|$|R

25|$|Brazil's {{return to}} {{democracy}} in 1985 after over 20years of military authoritarian rule, {{and the subsequent}} end of rampant censorship, allowed for a new freedom of expression which promoted creativity and experimentation in expressive culture. Commercial and cultural imports from Europe and North America have often influenced Brazil's own cultural output. For example, the hip hop that has stemmed from New York is localized into forms of musical production such as Funk Carioca and Brazilian hip hop. Bands from Rio de Janeiro also had influence in the mid-to-late development of the Punk in Brazil, and that of Brazilian thrash metal. <b>Democratic</b> <b>renewal</b> also allowed for the recognition and acceptance of this diversification of Brazilian culture.|$|E

2500|$|In this book, she {{proposes a}} new model for {{organizing}} media: [...] a nonprofit media organization (NMO), which combines aspects of both a joint-stock company and a foundation. [...] The goal is to allow sharing and <b>democratic</b> <b>renewal</b> of power and funding. Readers, journalists and other, [...] "crowdfunders", would see their contributions in capital recognized {{by an increase in}} voting rights {{at the expense of the}} power of the largest shareholders. Media would thus benefit from open donations and reductions in taxes. [...] Cagé claims these will replace the current media subsidies, which are often opaque and innefective, with a [...] "neutral, transparent and citizen" [...] support system. [...] Éric Fottorino claimed that this model will not likely work well for large media, which he believes will not function well without shareholders, who will demand influence in proportion to their investment.|$|E
