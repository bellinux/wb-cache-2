40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} the entrapment of protein molecules in cubosomic nanocarriers that are sterically stabilized by an amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) derivative. Toward that aim, the mechanism of fragmentation of a self-assembled, PEGylated cubic lipid phase into nanoparticles (NPs) is investigated in excess aqueous medium. The molar ratio between the cubic-phase-forming lipid monoolein (MO) and its PEGylated derivative (MO-PEG(2000)) is selected as to favor the formation of inverted-type liquid-crystalline (LC) structures (permitting one to reveal the stages of the fragmentation and bicontinuous membrane NP assembly process) rather than a phase transformation to lamellar or micellar phases. The PEGylated amphiphile considerably affects the interfacial curvature of the cubic lipid membrane and, under agitation, contributes to the fragmentation of the bicontinuous cubic lattice into NPs. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy (FF-EM), quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS), and confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy (CLSFM) are applied for determination of the NPs' sizes, inner organization, and stability with regard to a thermal stimulus. Entrapped protein molecules can essentially stabilize the cubosomic particles (proteocubosomes), which display well-defined inner organization of nanochannels in their freeze-fracture planes. The protein α-chymotrypsinogen A is studied in proteocubosome dispersions by means of <b>far-UV</b> synchrotron <b>radiation</b> circular dichroism (SRCD) spectroscopy. It is suggested that the protein molecules are entrapped {{in the interior of}} the PEGylated cubosomes via a "nanopockets" mechanism.

Using a PHR 1 -lacZ fusion gene in which expression of beta-galactosidase is regulated by PHR 1 5 ' regulatory elements, we found that exposure of cells to 254 -nm light, 4 -nitroquinoline-N-oxide, methyl methanesulfonate, and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine induced synthesis of increased amounts of fusion protein. In contrast to these DNA-damaging agents, neither heat shock nor exposure to photoreactivating light elicited a response. Induction by <b>far-UV</b> <b>radiation</b> was evident both when the fusion gene was carried on a multicopy plasmid and when it replaced the endogenous chromosomal copy of PHR 1, and it was accompanied {{by an increase in}} the steady-state concentration of PHR 1 -lacZ mRNA. Northern (RNA) blot analysis of PHR 1 mRNA encoded by the chromosomal locus was consistent with either enhanced transcription of PHR 1 after DNA damage or stabilization of the transcripts. Neither the intact PHR 1 or RAD 2 gene was required for induction. Comparison of the region of PHR 1 implicated in regulation of its expression with other damage-inducible genes from yeast cells revealed a common conserved sequence that is present in the PHR 1, RAD 2, and RNR 2 genes and is required for damage inducibility of the latter two genes.

We have stacked the spectra of ∼ 2, 000 DLA systems (N_HI> 10 ^ 20. 6 cm^- 2) with a median absorption redshift = 2. 6 selected from quasars observed in the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} {{calculation of the}} propagation of AGN-like ionizing radiation through the intergalactic space. We model the ionization state of absorbing clouds, and show that the universe will be more opaque above 4 Ryd than previously estimated. Singly ionized helium in forest clouds and Lyman-limit systems {{is found to be}} very efficient in reprocessing soft X-ray, helium-ionizing photons into ultraviolet, hydrogen-ionizing ones. We demonstrate that a significant fraction of the absorbed primary photons (emitted, e. g., by quasar sources) will be reradiated by the photoionized gas through line emission, two-photon continuum, and recombination continuum radiation. In the light of new data and recent studies, we also reassess the contribution of the QSOs observed in optical surveys to the UV extragalactic background, and find that the stochastic reprocessing of quasar Lyman continuum radiation by hydrogen and helium along the line of sight will significantly affect the amplitude spectral shape, and fluctuations properties of the metagalactic flux. In a scenario in which QSOs are the primary source of ionizing photons in the universe, the integrated emission at z= 0 from photoionized clouds and Lyman-limit systems is found to be at a level of less than 5 % of current observational limits on the <b>far-UV</b> extragalactic <b>radiation</b> flux.

40|$|Abstract Background Environmental {{surfaces}} play {{an important}} role in transmission of healthcare-associated pathogens. There is a need for new disinfection methods that are effective against Clostridium difficile spores, but also safe and rapid. The Sterilray™ Disinfection Wand device is a hand-held room decontamination technology that utilizes far-ultraviolet radiation (185 - 230 [*]nm) to kill pathogens. Methods We examined the efficacy of disinfection using the Sterilray device in the laboratory, in rooms of hospitalized patients, and on surfaces outside of patient rooms (i. e. keyboards and portable medical equipment). Cultures for C. difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) were collected from commonly-touched surfaces before and after use of the Sterilray device. Results On inoculated surfaces in the laboratory, application of the Sterilray device at a radiant dose of 100 [*]mJ/cm 2 for[*]~[*] 5 seconds consistently reduced recovery of C. difficile spores by 4. 4 [*]CFU log 10, MRSA by 5. 4 log 10 CFU and of VRE by 6. 9 log 10 CFU. A > 3 log 10 reduction of MRSA and VRE was achieved in ~ 2 seconds at a lower radiant dose, but killing of C. difficile spores was significantly reduced. On keyboards and portable medical equipment that were inoculated with C. difficile spores, application of the Sterilray device at a radiant dose of 100 [*]mJ/cm 2 for[*]~[*] 5 seconds reduced contamination by 3. 2 log 10 CFU. However, the presence of organic material reduced the lethal effect of the <b>far-UV</b> <b>radiation.</b> In hospital rooms that were not pre-cleaned, disinfection with the Sterilray device significantly reduced the frequency of positive C. difficile and MRSA cultures (P = 0. 007).

However, the presence of organic matter reduces the efficacy of <b>far-UV</b> <b>radiation,</b> possibly explaining the more modest results observed on surfaces in hospital rooms that were not pre-cleaned. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the chemical stability of CO 2 -dominated atmospheres of desiccated M dwarf terrestrial exoplanets using a 1 -dimensional photochemical model. Around Sun-like stars, CO 2 photolysis by <b>Far-UV</b> (FUV) <b>radiation</b> is balanced by recombination reactions {{that depend on}} water abundance. Planets orbiting M dwarf stars experience more FUV radiation, and could be depleted in water due to M dwarfs' prolonged, high-luminosity pre-main sequences (Luger & Barnes 2015). We show that, for water-depleted M dwarf terrestrial planets, a catalytic cycle relying on H 2 O 2 photolysis can maintain a CO 2 atmosphere. However, this cycle breaks down for atmospheric hydrogen mixing ratios < 1 ppm, resulting in ~ 40 % of the atmospheric CO 2 being converted to CO and O 2 on a time scale of 1 Myr. The increased O 2 abundance leads to high O 3 concentrations, the photolysis of which forms another CO 2 -regenerating catalytic cycle. For atmospheres with < 0. 1 ppm hydrogen, CO 2 is produced directly from the recombination of CO and O. These catalytic cycles place an upper limit of ~ 50 % {{on the amount of}} CO 2 that can be destroyed via photolysis, which is enough to generate Earth-like abundances of (abiotic) O 2 and O 3. The conditions that lead to such high oxygen levels could be widespread on planets in the habitable zones of M dwarfs. Discrimination between biological and abiotic O 2 and O 3 in this case can perhaps be accomplished by noting the lack of water features in the reflectance and emission spectra of these planets, which necessitates observations at wavelengths longer than 0. 95 microns.

We use surveys of entire molecular clouds to understand the range and distribution of cluster membership, size and surface density. The Spitzer data demonstrate clearly {{that there is a}} continuum of star- forming environments, from relative isolation to dense clusters. The number of members of a cluster is correlated with the cluster radius, such that the average surface density of clusters having a few to a thousand members varies by a factor of only a few. The spatial distributions of Spitzer-identified young stellar objects frequently show elongation, low density halos, and sub-clustering. The spatial distributions of protostars resemble the distribution of dense molecular gas, suggesting that their morphologies result directly from the fragmentation of the natal gas. We also examine the effects of the cluster environments on star and planet formation. Although <b>Far-UV</b> and Extreme-UV <b>radiation</b> from massive stars can truncate disks in a few million years, fewer than half of the young stars in our sample (embedded clusters within 1 kpc) are found in regions of strong FUV and EUV fields.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the presence of}} COMs in strongly UV-irradiated interstellar molecular gas. We have carried out a complete millimetre line survey using the IRAM 30 m telescope towards {{the edge of the}} Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR), close to the H 2 dissociation front, a position irradiated by a very intense <b>far-UV</b> (FUV) <b>radiation</b> field. These observations have been complemented with 8. 5 arcsec resolution maps of the H 2 CO 5 (1, 5) - 4 (1, 4) and C 18 O 3 - 2 emission at 0. 9 mm. Despite being a harsh environment, we detect more than 250 lines from COMs and related precursors: H 2 CO, CH 3 OH, HCO, H 2 CCO, CH 3 CHO, H 2 CS, HCOOH, CH 3 CN, CH 2 NH, HNCO, H 13 - 2 CO, and HC 3 N (in decreasing order of abundance). For each species, the large number of detected lines allowed us to accurately constrain their rotational temperatures (Trot) and column densities (N). Owing to subthermal excitation and intricate spectroscopy of some COMs (symmetric- and asymmetric-top molecules such as CH 3 CN and H 2 CO, respectively), a correct determination of N and Trot requires building rotational population diagrams of their rotational ladders separately. We also provide accurate upper limit abundances for chemically related molecules that might have been expected, but are not conclusively detected {{at the edge of the}} PDR (HDCO, CH 3 O, CH 3 NC, CH 3 CCH, CH 3 OCH 3, HCOOCH 3, CH 3 CH 2 OH, CH 3 CH 2 CN, and CH 2 CHCN). A non-LTE LVG excitation analysis for molecules with known collisional rate coefficients, suggests that some COMs arise from different PDR layers but we cannot resolve them spatially. In particular, H 2 CO and CH 3 CN survive in the extended gas directly exposed to the strong FUV flux (Tk = 150 - 250 K and Td > 60 K), whereas CH 3 OH only arises from denser and cooler gas clumps in the more shielded PDR interior (Tk = 40 - 50 K). We find a HCO/H 2 CO/CH 3 OH = 1 / 5 / 3 abundance ratio. These ratios are different from those inferred in hot cores and shocks. Comment: 29 pages, 22 figures, 17 tables.

These observations are analysed in combination with H? line emission, aromatic dust, CO and dust continuum emissions. The Horsehead nebula illuminated by the O 9. 5 V star ? Ori (? ? 60) presents a typical photodissociation region (PDR) viewed nearly edge-on and offers an ideal opportunity to study the gas density structure of a PDR. The H 2 fluorescent emission observations reveal extremely sharp and bright filaments associated with the illuminated edge of the nebula which spatially coincides with the aromatic dust emission. Analysis of the H 2 fluorescent emission, sensitive to both the <b>far-UV</b> <b>radiation</b> field and the gas density, {{in conjunction with the}} aromatic dust and H? line emission, brings new constraints on the illumination conditions and the gas density in the outer PDR region. Furthermore, combination of this data with millimeter observations of CO and dust continuum emission allows us to trace the penetration of the <b>far-UV</b> <b>radiation</b> field into the cloud and probe the gas density structure throughout the PDR. From comparison with PDR model calculations, we find that i) the gas density follows a steep gradient at the cloud edge, with a scale length of 0. 02 pc (or 10 '') and nH? 104 and 105 cm- 3 in the H 2 emitting and inner cold molecular layers respectively; and ii) this density gradient model is essentially a constant pressure model, with P? 4 × 106 K cm- 3. The constraints derived here on the gas density profile are important for the study of physical and chemical processes in PDRs and provide new insight into the evolution of interstellar clouds.

Of primary concern are the far-UV photodegradation effects since little is known in this area. The materials studied were polycarbonate (PC), fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymer (FEP), and a polyimide-siloxane block copolymer (PISX). Far-UV irradiation of solid PC produced significant mass loss by volatilization (photoablation). The remaining polymer surface was modified (deoxygenated) to a depth of only tens of nanometers, leaving the 2 ̆ 2 bulk 2 ̆ 2 unaffected. Far-UV/AO exposure of solid PC resulted in large mass loss. The polymer was cleaved by AO into small volatile pieces. Far-UV/AO irradiation of FEP thermal control film resulted in large mass loss. Defluorination and chain scission from AO impingement eroded the polymer surface quickly. FEP thermal control film exposed on the NASA LDEF mission was dependent upon the sample location as to the type and degree of modification observed. Samples exposed in the ram direction (direction of flight) showed enormous mass loss and destruction of the optical properties. Far-UV/AO irradiation of PISX films resulted in appreciable mass loss. The advanced hybrid structure, designed to protect the polymer from AO attack by forming a protective Si-O layer from PDMS blocks at the surface, performed marginally well.

Of the countless number of chemical species terrestrial life produces, only a few have the distinct spectral features and the necessary atmospheric abundance to be detectable. The easiest of these species to observe in Earth's atmosphere is O_ 2 (and its photochemical byproduct, O_ 3). But O_ 2 can also be produced abiotically by photolysis of CO_ 2, followed by recombination of O atoms with each other. CO is produced in stoichiometric proportions. Whether O_ 2 and CO can accumulate to appreciable concentrations depends on the ratio of <b>far-UV</b> to near-UV <b>radiation</b> coming from the planet's parent star and on what happens to these gases when they dissolve in a planet's oceans. Using a one-dimensional photochemical model, we demonstrate that O_ 2 derived from CO_ 2 photolysis should not accumulate to measurable concentrations on planets around F- and G-type stars. K-star, and especially M-star planets, however, may build up O_ 2 because of the low near-UV flux from their parent stars, in agreement with some previous studies. On such planets, a 'false positive' for life is possible if recombination of dissolved CO and O_ 2 in the oceans is slow and if other O_ 2 sinks (e. g., reduced volcanic gases or dissolved ferrous iron) are small. O_ 3, on the other hand, could be detectable at UV wavelengths (λ < 300 nm) for a much broader range of boundary conditions and stellar types. Comment: 20 pages text, 9 figure...|$|R

The [C II], CO, and FIR continuum emission may be modeled as arising from photodissociation regions (PDRs) that have a characteristic gas density of n approx. 10 (exp 4. 2) /cu cm., and that are illuminated by a <b>far-UV</b> <b>radiation</b> field approx. 10 (exp 3. 2) times more intense than the local interstellar radiation field. The mass in these PDRs accounts for {{approximately half of the}} molecular gas mass in this galaxy. The L[C II]/L(sub F 1 R) ratio is higher than observed in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies or in the few high-redshift QSOs detected in [C II], but the L[CII]/L(sub FIR) and L(sub CO) /L(sub FIR) ratios are similar to the values seen in nearby starburst galaxie...|$|E
40|$|Deuterium {{fractionation}} {{is known}} to enhance the [DCO+]/[HCO+] abundance ratio over the D/H elemental ratio of about 1 e- 5 {{in the cold and}} dense gas typically found in pre-stellar cores. We report the first detection and mapping of very bright DCO+ J= 3 - 2 and J= 2 - 1 lines (3 and 4 K respectively) towards the Horsehead photodissociation region (PDR) observed with the IRAM- 30 m telescope. The DCO+ emission peaks close to the illuminated warm edge of the nebula (= 0. 02) is inferred at the DCO+ emission peak, a condensation shielded from the illuminating <b>far-UV</b> <b>radiation</b> field where the gas must be cold (10 - 20 K) and dense (>= 2 x 10 ^ 5 cm- 3). DCO+ is not detected in the warmer photodissociation front, implying a lower [DCO+]/[HCO+] ratio (< 1 e- 3). According to our gas phase chemical predictions, such a high deuterium fractionation of HCO+ can only be explained if the gas temperature is below 20 K, in good agreement with DCO+ excitation calculations.

40|$|The {{observed}} {{behavior of}} eta Car from 1860 to 1940 {{has not been}} considered in most recent accounts, nor has it been explained in any quantitative model. We have used modern digital processing techniques to examine Harvard objective-prism spectra made from 1892 to 1941. Relatively high-excitation He I 4471 and [Fe III] 4658 emission, conspicuous today, were weak and perhaps absent throughout those years. Feast et al. noted this qualitative fact for other pre- 1920 spectra, but we quantify it and extend it to a time only three years before Gaviola's first observations of the high-excitation features. Evidently the supply of helium-ionizing photons(lambda < 504 A) grew rapidly between 1941 and 1944. The apparent scarcity of such <b>far-UV</b> <b>radiation</b> before 1944 is difficult to explain in models that employ a hot massive secondary star,} because no feasible dense wind or obscuration by dust would have hidden the photoionization caused by the proposed companion during most of its orbital period. We also discuss the qualitative near-constancy of the spectrum from 1900 to 1940, and eta Car's photometric and spectroscopic transition between 1940 and 1953. Comment: 41 pages, 12 figure...|$|E

The maps are interpreted {{with reference to}} a previous model for {{the structure of the}} cloud in which opposing jets from a central object, embedded in a rotating interstellar disc, precess and drive a bipolar molecular outflow. The (CO) -O- 18 emission traces the rotating interstellar disc, but the [C I]] emission shows several features. An unresolved component is observed which probably results from dissociation of CO in the centre of the disc by UV radiation from the central source. Background [C I] emission is also observed which shares the rotation of the disc on larger scales. The C I/CO ratio in these components is typically a few per cent. High-velocity [C I] emission, where C I/CO is high (> 0. 1 - 0. 4), is observed between the CO molecular outflow and the cavity exacavated by the jet. This material has probably been accelerated by the jet but dissociated by <b>far-UV</b> <b>radiation</b> propagating through the cavity.

40|$|Using a limited, but {{representative}} sample of sources in the ISM of our Galaxy with published spectra from the Infrared Space Observatory, we analyze flux ratios between the major mid-IR emission features (EFs) centered around 6. 2, 7. 7, 8. 6 and 11. 3 µm, respectively. In a flux ratio-to-flux ratio plot of EF(6. 2 µm) /EF(7. 7 µm) {{as a function of}} EF(11. 3 µm) /EF(7. 7 µm), the sample sources form roughly a Λ-shaped locus which appear to trace, on an overall basis, the hardness of a local heating radiation field. But some driving parameters other than the radiation field may also be required for a full interpretation of this trend. On the other hand, the flux ratio of EF(8. 6 µm) /EF(7. 7 µm) shows little variation over the sample sources, except for two HII regions which have much higher values for this ratio due to an “EF(8. 6 µm) anomaly, ” a phenomenon clearly associated with environments of an intense <b>far-UV</b> <b>radiation</b> field. If further confirmed on a larger database, these trends should provide crucial information on how the EF carriers collectively respond to a changing environment.

40|$|Current {{predictions}} for the line ratios from photo-dissociative regions (PDRs) in galaxies adopt theoretical models that consider only individual parcels of PDR gas each {{characterized by the}} local density and <b>far-UV</b> <b>radiation</b> field. However, these quantities are not measured directly from unresolved galaxies, making the connection between theory and observation ambiguous. We develop a model that uses galaxy-averaged, observable inputs to explain and predict measurements of the [CII] fine structure line in luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies. We find that the [CII] deficit observed in the highest IR surface-brightness systems is a natural consequence of saturating the upper fine-structure transition state at gas temperatures above 91 K. To reproduce the measured amplitude of the [CII]/FIR ratio in deficit galaxies, we require that [CII] trace approximately 10 - 17 % of all gas in these systems, roughly independent of IR surface brightness and consistent with observed [CII] to CO(1 [...] 0) line ratios. Calculating {{the value of this}} fraction is a challenge for theoretical models. The difficulty may reside in properly treating the topology of molecular and dissociated gas, different descriptions for which may be observationally distinguished by the [OI] 63 micron line in yet-to-be-probed regions of parameter space, allowing PDR emission lines from to probe not only the effects of star formation but also the state and configuration of interstellar gas.

40|$|Context. The {{structure}} of protoplanetary disks {{is thought to}} be linked to the temperature and chemistry of their dust and gas. Whether the disk is flat or flaring depends on the amount of radiation that it absorbs at a given radius and on the efficiency with which this is converted into thermal energy. The understanding of these heating and cooling processes is crucial for providing a reliable disk structure for interpreting dust continuum emission and gas line fluxes. Especially in the upper layers of the disk, where gas and dust are thermally decoupled, the infrared line emission is strictly related to the gas heating/cooling processes. Aims. We aim to study the thermal properties of the disk in the oxygen line emission region and to investigate the relative importance of X-ray (1 – 120 Å) and <b>far-UV</b> <b>radiation</b> (FUV, 912 – 2070 Å) for the heating balance there. Methods. We use [O] 63 µm line fluxes observed in a sample of protoplanetary disks of the Taurus/Auriga star-forming region and compare it to the model predictions presented in our previous work. The data were obtained with the PACS instrument on board the Herschel Space Observatory as part of the Herschel open time key program GAS in Protoplanetary diskS (GASPS). Results. Our theoretical grid of disk models can reproduce the [O] absolute fluxes and predict a correlation between [O] and th...|$|E

The sample is restricted to galaxies with flux densities higher than S_ 160 um> 150 mJy and optical spectra from the GAMA survey at 0. 02 2. 5 x 10 ^- 3 with respect to those showing lower ratios. In particular, those with high ratios tend to have: (1) L_IR< 10 ^ 11 Lo; (2) cold dust temperatures, T_d< 30 K; (3) disk-like morphologies in r-band images; (4) a WISE colour 0. 5 <S_ 12 um/S_ 22 um< 1. 0; (5) low surface brightness Sigma_IR~ 10 ^ 8 - 9 Lo kpc^- 2, (6) and specific star-formation rates of sSFR~ 0. 05 - 3 Gyr^- 1. We suggest that the strength of the <b>far-UV</b> <b>radiation</b> fields () is main parameter responsible for controlling the [CII]/IR ratio. It is possible that relatively high creates a positively charged dust grain distribution, impeding an efficient photo-electric extraction of electrons from these grains to then collisionally excite carbon atoms. Within the brighter IR population, 11 <log(L_IR/Lo) < 12, the low [CII]/IR ratio is unlikely to be modified by [CII] self absorption or controlled by the presence of a moderately luminous AGN (identified via the BPT diagram).

Line splitting observed extensively over the E molecular cloud {{suggests that it is}} best explained as the expanding remnant of a thick toroid surrounding the optical lobes. The poor correlation between the observed molecular line emission and dust continuum emission in the E cloud is probably due to a large temperature gradient. Strong C I emission from the protostellar candidate S 106 FIR suggests the nearby presence of a powerful source of <b>far-UV</b> <b>radiation,</b> whose energy supply is unlikely to arise from gravitational contraction of a protostar. It is probable that this source is the star S 106 LR, which also heats S 106 FIR. There is evidence, in both C I and (CO) -O- 18, for a predominantly blueshifted outflow from S 106 IR, best interpreted as a stellar wind-driven shock into the toroidal remnant. (CO) -O- 18 and (CO) -C- 13 appear to be depleted, relative to canonical values for their abundances, in S 106 FIR, despite its high optical extinction, which should discourage selective photodissociation.
