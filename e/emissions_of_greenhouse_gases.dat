In 2015, Dalhousie received a GOLD rating from AASHE STARS (Version 2.0). In 2009, the university signed the University and College Presidents’ Climate Change Statement of Action for Canada to reduce <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases.</b> Dalhousie is also a signatory of UNEP's International Declaration on Cleaner Production. In 1999, the university signed the Talloires Declaration, which committed Dalhousie and other higher education institutions to developing, creating, supporting, and maintaining sustainability.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, GCC {{assembled}} {{an advisory}} committee of scientific and technical experts to compile an internal-only, 17-page report on climate science entitled Predicting Future Climate Change: A Primer, which said: “The scientific basis for the Greenhouse Effect and {{the potential impact of}} human <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied.” In early 1996, GCC's operating committee asked the advisory committee to redact the sections that rebutted contrarian arguments, and accepted the report and distributed it to members. The draft document was disclosed in a 2007 lawsuit filed by the auto industry against California’s efforts to regulate automotive greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E

25|$|Methane {{and power}} {{produced}} in anaerobic digestion facilities {{can be used}} to replace energy derived from fossil fuels, and hence reduce <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases,</b> because the carbon in biodegradable material is part of a carbon cycle. The carbon released into the atmosphere from the combustion of biogas has been removed by plants for them to grow in the recent past, usually within the last decade, but more typically within the last growing season. If the plants are regrown, taking the carbon out of the atmosphere once more, the system will be carbon neutral. In contrast, carbon in fossil fuels has been sequestered in the earth for many millions of years, the combustion of which increases the overall levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|While {{monitoring}} and controlling environmental releases of plants has been difficult, the EPA has been enforcing their policies regarding air quality {{over the last}} decade under President Barack Obama. While the Clean Air Act postulates regulations and rules limiting the <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases,</b> other laws are concerned with standards of power plants and initiatives to enforce these laws have been formed. The impacts of mining are diverse and have possible negative effects for humans and the biosphere. Among these are acid mine drainage, subsidence and mine workers' health risks, to prevent which there are regulations regarding mining practices like strip mining. Even though regulations seek to address environmental impacts, they often do not provide remedy for the social and health disparities created by exposure to emissions from electric power plants.|$|E

In the scientific literature, there is a strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused by human-induced <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases.</b> No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view, though a few organizations with members in extractive industries hold non-committal positions. Disputes over the key scientific facts of global warming are more prevalent in the media than in the scientific literature, where such issues are treated as resolved, and such disputes are more prevalent in the United States than globally.|$|E

25|$|The Kyoto Protocol is {{the most}} {{prominent}} international agreement on climate change, and is also highly controversial. Some argue that it goes too far or not nearly far enough in restricting <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases.</b> Another area of controversy {{is the fact that}} China and India, the world's two most populous countries, both ratified the protocol but are not required to reduce or even limit the growth of carbon emissions under the present agreement even though when listed by greenhouse gas emissions per capita, they have rankings of 121st largest per capita emitter at 3.9 Tonnes of e and 162nd largest per capita emitter at 1.8 Tonnes of e respectively, compared with for example the U.S. at position of the 14th largest per capita e emitter at 22.9 Tonnes of e. Nevertheless, China is the world's second largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions, and India 4th (see: countries by greenhouse emissions). Various predictions see China overtaking the US in total greenhouse emissions between late 2007 and 2010, and according to many other estimates, this already occurred in 2006.|$|E
