5|$|In 1517, Martin Luther, an Augustinian friar in Germany, {{sent his}} Ninety-Five Theses to several bishops. His theses protested key points of Catholic {{doctrine}} {{as well as}} the sale of indulgences. In Switzerland, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin and other Protestant Reformers further criticised Catholic teachings. These challenges developed into the <b>European</b> <b>movement</b> called the Protestant Reformation, which gave birth to a variety of Christian denominations known today collectively as Protestantism. The English Reformation during the reign of Henry VIII began as a political dispute. When the pope denied Henry's petition for a declaration of nullity of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, he had the Acts of Supremacy passed, making him head of Church of England, forming Protestant Anglicanism.|$|E

500|$|The next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, Patience, {{opened at}} the Opera Comique in April 1881 and was another big success, {{becoming}} the second longest-running piece in the series and enjoying numerous foreign productions. [...] Patience satirised the self-indulgent Aesthetic movement of the 1870s and '80s in England, part of the 19th-century <b>European</b> <b>movement</b> that emphasised aesthetic values over moral or social themes in literature, fine art, the decorative arts, and interior design.

The government responded with several ad hoc measures, including supplying arms to [...] "loyal" [...] factions, organising a force of Arawa tribesmen under European leaders, and a series of small expeditions of volunteer settlers from Hawke's Bay.|$|E

2500|$|After World War II, European {{integration}} {{was seen}} as an antidote to the extreme nationalism which had devastated the continent. In a speech delivered on 19 September 1946 at the University of Zürich, Switzerland, Winston Churchill postulated the emerging of a United States of Europe during the 20th century. The 1948 Hague Congress was a pivotal moment in European federal history, as it {{led to the creation of}} the <b>European</b> <b>Movement</b> International and of the College of Europe, where Europe's future leaders would live and study together. 1952 saw the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community, which was declared to be [...] "a first step in the federation of Europe." [...] The supporters of the Community included Alcide De Gasperi, Jean Monnet, Robert Schuman, and Paul-Henri Spaak. These men and others are officially credited as the Founding fathers of the European Union.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 December 1929 — {{which would}} be known {{thereafter}} as [...] "Black Saturday" [...] — New Zealand military police fired upon a peaceful demonstration which had assembled to welcome home A.G. Smyth, a <b>European</b> <b>movement</b> leader returning to Samoa after a two-year exile. Reports of the massacre are sketchy because the official cover-up for the incident was so effective. Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III had rushed {{to the front of}} the crowd and turned to face his people; he called for peace from them because some were throwing stones at the police. With his back to the police calling for peace he was shot in the back; another Samoan who rushed to help him was shot in both legs while cradling his head. Another who had attempted to shield his body from the bullets was shot. Two more rushing to help were killed before they could reach him.|$|E
2500|$|The opera is a satire on the {{aesthetic}} {{movement of the}} 1870s and '80s in England, part of the 19th-century <b>European</b> <b>movement</b> that emphasised aesthetic values over moral or social themes in literature, fine art, the decorative arts, and interior design. Called [...] "Art for Art's Sake", the movement valued its ideals of beauty above any pragmatic concerns. Although the output of poets, painters and designers was prolific, some argued that the movement's art, poetry and fashion was empty and self-indulgent. That the movement was so popular and also so easy to ridicule as a meaningless fad helped make Patience a big hit. The same factors made a hit out of The Colonel, a play by F. C. Burnand based partly on the satiric cartoons of George du Maurier in Punch magazine. The Colonel beat Patience to the stage by several weeks, but Patience outran Burnand's play. According to Burnand's 1904 memoir, Sullivan's friend the composer Frederic Clay leaked to Burnand the information that Gilbert and Sullivan were working on an [...] "æsthetic subject", and so Burnand raced to produce The Colonel before Patience opened. Modern productions of Patience have sometimes updated {{the setting of the}} opera to an analogous era such as the hippie 1960s, making a flower-child poet the rival of a beat poet.|$|E
