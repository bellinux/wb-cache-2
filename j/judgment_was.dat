5|$|ABC News denied BPI's claims, {{and called}} the lawsuit without merit. ABC News sought to have the case removed from South Dakota state court to federal court. In June 2013, a federal judge sent the lawsuit back to state court. On March 27, 2014, South Dakota state court Judge Cheryle Gering {{rejected}} ABC's motion to dismiss, and allowed the defamation suit to move forward. Diane Sawyer's motion for summary <b>judgment</b> <b>was</b> granted and she was dismissed.|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the development and}} validation of measuring online and memory-based judgment formation. The on-line model holds that <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> formed when the information is encountered while the memory-based model affirms that <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> formed {{based on the information}} people can recall from memory at a time a <b>judgment</b> <b>is</b> needed. In a correlation analysis, there is lower response latency, higher judgmental confidence and attitude extremity when the <b>judgment</b> <b>is</b> formed on-line. In construct validation, people who have formed memory-based judgments need more time to report their attitudes...|$|R

5000|$|Vacated Judgment: a {{judgment}} of an appellate court whereby the <b>judgment</b> under review <b>is</b> set aside {{and a new}} trial is ordered. A vacated <b>judgment</b> <b>is</b> rendered where the original judgment failed to make an order {{in accordance with the}} law and a new trial is ordered to ensure a just outcome. The process of vacating a <b>judgment</b> <b>is</b> sometimes referred to as vacatur. The result of a vacated <b>judgment</b> <b>is</b> a trial de novo.|$|R
5|$|Gernsback's {{recovery}} from the bankruptcy <b>judgment</b> <b>was</b> remarkably quick. By early June he had launched three new magazines, two of which published science fiction. The June 1929 issue of Science Wonder Stories appeared on newsstands on 5May 1929, and was followed on 5June by the July 1929 issue of Air Wonder Stories. Both magazines were monthly, with Gernsback as editor-in-chief and David Lasser as editor. Lasser had no prior editing experience and knew little about science fiction, but his recently acquired degree from MIT convinced Gernsback to hire him.|$|E
5|$|In his {{monograph}} Project Apollo: The Tough Decisions, Deputy Administrator Seamans {{wrote that}} NASA's single worst mistake in engineering <b>judgment</b> <b>was</b> {{not to run}} a fire test on the Command Module before the plugs-out test. In the first episode of the 2009 BBC documentary series NASA: Triumph and Tragedy, Jim McDivitt said that NASA {{had no idea how}} a 100% oxygen atmosphere would influence burning. Similar remarks by other astronauts were expressed in the 2007 documentary film In the Shadow of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|The High Court's {{judgment}} {{marked a}} successful appeal for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Australian regulator of anti-competitive conduct, having lost {{at first instance}} and on appeal in the Federal Court of Australia. The ACCC was again successful when the case was remitted to the Federal Court for reconsideration, ending eight years of litigation between the parties. The High Court's <b>judgment</b> <b>was</b> received as a significant precedent in the law of derivative governmental immunity in Australia.|$|E
40|$|Qualitative <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> an {{integral}} part of business valuation practice. These <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> often viewed with suspicion as being "subjective" and more prone to bias than quantitative procedures. These <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> not subjective and not necessarily biased. However, qualitative <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> often a source of bias and their abuse can and often does lead to wildly inconsistent results in actual practice. The solution to this problem is not the elimination of qualitative <b>judgments.</b> This <b>is</b> neither desirable nor possible. Two approaches to the treatment of qualitative judgments may reduce their misuse: first, judicious limiting of acceptable choices in making particular judgments and second, the breaking down of large qualitative judgments into smaller components by wider use of ordinal scale. ...|$|R
50|$|The seven Vial/Bowl <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> {{similar in}} nature to the Trumpet judgments, {{but far more}} serious for {{there will be no}} warning when they come. In addition, there are three key {{differences}} between the Trumpet judgments and the Vial/Bowl judgments: firstly, the Trumpet <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> plagues that bring partial devastation and plagues upon 1/3 of nature and people, while the Vial/Bowl <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> more severe direct assaults against humanity and nature, thus bringing more chaos on the earth than the Trumpet judgments. Lastly, the Trumpet judgments offer a possibility of redemption and repentance, while the Vial judgments do not; the Vial <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> a literal assault on those who have taken the mark of the Beast, and to those who are considered incorrigibles and arrogantly unrepentant, thus making them impossible to save. The Vial/Bowl <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> listed below.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} precision of the pCI rule through three experiments. The results show that first, the tendency of the subjects’ casual <b>judgments</b> <b>was</b> basically similar to the pCI rule. But (a + d) / n predicted human’s casual <b>judgments</b> <b>were</b> even better; second, the increase of subjects’ casual <b>judgments</b> <b>was</b> milder than the pCI rule, and the subjects needed time to construct their own way of judging relationship; finally, different people had different ways of causal <b>judgments,</b> and could <b>be</b> grouped into some categories...|$|R
5|$|He joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney {{law firm}} specializing in civil rights {{litigation}} and neighborhood economic development, where he was an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then of counsel from 1996 to 2004. In 1994, he was listed {{as one of the}} lawyers in Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank, 94 C 4094 (N.D. Ill.). This class action lawsuit was filed in 1994 with Selma Buycks-Roberson as lead plaintiff and alleged that Citibank Federal Savings Bank had engaged in practices forbidden under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act. The case was settled out of court. Final <b>Judgment</b> <b>was</b> issued on May 13, 1998, with Citibank Federal Savings Bank agreeing to pay attorney fees. His law license became inactive in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The ACCC {{conceded that}} the state governments were not {{carrying}} on businesses in procuring the medical products. This meant that the governments were immune from Sections46 and 47 of the TPA. Baxter argued that this immunity extended to itself, by claiming derivative governmental immunity. On 16 May 2005, The Federal Court of Australia (Allsop J presiding) found in Baxter's favour at first instance. While {{the court held that}} Baxter would have breached the TPA, governmental immunity under Section2B extended to Baxter Healthcare. Allsop J's <b>judgment</b> <b>was</b> upheld unanimously on appeal to the full bench of the Federal Court (Justices Mansfield, Dowsett and Gyles presiding). The full bench expressed unease about its own judgment, stating that the question of derivative governmental immunity should be left to the High Court for reconsideration of Bradken.|$|E
5|$|The book {{discusses}} related legal {{practices of}} countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Switzerland and Germany. Israel {{was the first}} country to publicly acknowledge the practice—in November 2000. The author connects this policy initiative with Israel's ongoing conflict with Palestinian militants. Melzer argues that this policy was controversial—the issue came before the Israeli Supreme Court, where the matter was not decided for almost five years. The court's <b>judgment</b> <b>was</b> issued on 14 December 2006, but neither forbade nor endorsed the practice. Melzer asserts that it left multiple important legal conundra unresolved. Its significance was that it dealt not with a single incident, but rather {{with the nature of}} the policy itself and set forth conditions for examining the legality of future episodes.|$|E

5000|$|Interlocutory judgment: an {{interlocutory}} <b>judgment</b> <b>is</b> rendered {{when the}} court has enough information to make a decision.

40|$|Accounts of {{arguments}} from expert opinion {{take it for}} granted that expert <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> reliable, and so an argument that proceeds from premises about what an expert judges to a conclusion that the expert is probably right is a strong argument. In my (2013), I considered a potential justification for this assumption, namely, that expert <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> more likely to be true than novice judgments, and discussed empirical evidence suggesting that expert <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> not more reliable than novice judgments or even chance. In this paper, I consider another potential justification for this assumption, namely, that expert <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> not influenced by the kinds of cognitive biases novice <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> influenced by, and discuss empirical evidence suggesting that experts are vulnerable to pretty much the same kinds of cognitive biases as novices. If this is correct, then the basic assumption at the core of accounts {{of arguments}} from expert opinion remains unjustified...|$|R
5|$|The {{case was}} again appealed, {{this time to}} the House of Lords, where it was heard by Lord Templeman, Lord Goff, Lord Jauncey, Lord Lowry and Lord Woolf. The <b>judgment</b> <b>was</b> given by Lord Goff on 9 December 1993, and {{reinstated}} the decision of Kennedy J in the High Court of Justice; unlike the Court of Appeal decision, it directly {{addressed the issue of}} Rylands v Fletcher. Goff first addressed the Court of Appeal's use of Ballard v Tomlinson, stating that the decision there as based on the facts of the case, and did not establish either a rule that there was a right to clear water, nor that there was strict liability attached to that right.|$|E
5|$|World War II {{broke out}} shortly after Minton joined the court, {{creating}} {{a flood of}} cases in which legal precedent provided little guidance, including challenges to wartime measures, selective service laws, price controls, rationing and civil liberties. In {{the majority of these}} cases, the court affirmed the decisions of the district courts, but in several the court was required to establish a precedent. Minton stated on several occasions his personal preference to affirm the decisions of the lower courts. He believed that the court that heard the case and pronounced <b>judgment</b> <b>was</b> generally able to make a decision that was superior to appellate courts' decisions. He believed the appellate process should be reserved for the more serious cases and cases where the lower court had clearly made a mistake.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} years, much of Hereford's {{focus was on}} reconquering his lost lands in the Marches, {{primarily}} through private warfare against Llywelyn. Henry III died in 1272, while his sonnow Edward Iwas crusading; Edward did not return until 1274. Llywelyn refused {{to pay homage to}} the new king, partly because of the military actions of Bohun and other Marcher lords, which Llywelyn saw as violations of the Treaty of Montgomery. On 12 November 1276, Hereford was present at a royal assembly where <b>judgment</b> <b>was</b> passed on Llewelyn, and in 1277, Edward I declared war on the Welsh prince. Rebellion in his own Brecon lands delayed Hereford's participation {{in the early days of}} the Welsh war. He managed, however, to both suppress the rebellion, and conquer lands further west. He then joined up with the royal army and served for a while in Anglesey, before returning to Brecon, where he received the surrender of certain Welsh lords. After the campaign was over, on 2 January 1278, he received protection from King Edward to go on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in Spain.|$|E

5|$|At that time, Antoine had {{a student}} named Martin Jeanfils, an {{employee}} at the Corbeau coal. A few years ago, Jeanfils was certain to get a gift of healing by treating knee and foot sprains {{of his wife and}} himself, and was then consulted by patients in Jemeppe. Antoine and he were sued on 16 January 1907 on the grounds of illegal practice of the art of healing. Jeanfils explained to the court that he just wanted to do disappear the pain, and that he always sent his patients to doctors. For his part, Antoine told the judge that he simply {{put his hand on the}} forehead of patients and that he prescribed drugs; he denied the charge, and all the witnesses heard testified of the altruism of Antoine, who distributed money to the poor. Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Criminal Court on 15 June 1907, and the courtroom was entirely filled. Dr. Delville and the parents of a child cured by Antoine testified at the witness box, Mr. Dupret then pronounced the indictment. Adjourned, The <b>judgment</b> <b>was</b> adjourned and was finally, on 21 June 1907, President Hamoir acquitted the two men, who were absent in court then. Following an appeal by the prosecutor, Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Court again on 16 October 1907. The General Advocate Meyers made the indictment, analyzing the legislation of 1918 on the illegal art of healing, claiming that it was not what Antoine did. On 22 October of the same year, the acquittal was confirmed, and Meyers was deeply thanked by several faithful.|$|E
5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our <b>judgment</b> <b>was,</b> not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} of the franchises' displeasure with their parent over this issue came in 2005 and involved claims by a Manhattan-based franchise that the company failed {{to take into account}} local market conditions when setting prices. E-Z Eating Corp., operator of five restaurants in New York and owned by brother-sister partners Elizabeth and Luan Sadik, had been struggling after the 9/11 terrorist attacks but had been in a company-sponsored turn around program when Burger King started its new value program in 2006. The program required all locations to carry a specific set of products at a discounted price, with limited exemptions for certain locations that met a set of criteria. The Sadiks applied for an exemption to the pricing requirement but were turned down by Burger King. In response to the denial, the Sadiks closed two of their locations without consulting Burger King and refused to implement the scheme in their other two locations. Burger King responded by suing the company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida for breach of contract, and eventually revoked the franchise agreement for the remaining two locations in January 2006. The Sadik's responded by filing their own lawsuit in 2008 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York claiming that Burger King had engaged in a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair in its actions towards the franchise. The actions were eventually consolidated in a single case in the Southern District Court under Judge Maricia G. Cooke, where Burger King requested and was granted a summary judgement against the Sadiks. The <b>judgment</b> <b>was</b> upheld on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in June 2009.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} tested a model {{proposed}} by Cropanzano, Byrne, Bobocel, & Rupp (2001), which suggests {{two types of}} justice judgments: event based and social entity. Event based judgments encompass an individual’s feelings about the fairness of a single event, for example, a pay raise decision. Social entity judgments evaluate the general fairness of a social entity and transcend any particular event. These two types of <b>judgments</b> <b>were</b> examined via 1) a quantitative field study with 331 undergraduate students and 2) qualitative interviews with 25 undergraduate students. As predicted, both qualitative and quantitative findings indicate that {{the two types of}} <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> distinct yet related constructs. First, event based and social entity <b>judgments</b> <b>were</b> significantly positively correlated with one another. Second, event based and social entity judgments emerged as separate factors in a factor analysis. Third, there was evidence that both types of <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> made using different information. Fourth, in some cases, the two types of <b>judgments</b> <b>were</b> differentially related to outcomes. Fifth, results indicated that event based <b>judgments</b> may <b>be</b> used to form social entity ones through cognitive averaging. Implications for theory, measurement, and practice are discussed...|$|R
