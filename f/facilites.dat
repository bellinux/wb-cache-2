50|$|Cobl is {{responsible}} for the actin polymerization of filaments with fast-growing barbed ends. Cobl stabilizes a longitudinal actin-GTP dimer by two consecutive WH2 domains and it can interact laterally with another actin monomer to form an actin trimer. Rearrangements of the actin-actin contacts have to occur within this trimer to make a helical nucleus; the third WH2 domain of Cobl has been proposed to interact with the third actin subunit of this trimer. This Cobl-actin tetramer is forming a nucleus to <b>facilite</b> further G-actin addition.|$|R

50|$|Grbavica was reopened {{yet again}} on 25 April 1976, and in 1986 a modern {{northern}} stand was added {{which is still}} in use. Unfortunately, war began in spring 1992 and Željezničar was forced, yet again, to play on Koševo Stadium until 1996 when it came back to Grbavica. During the 1990s war the stadium suffered heavy structural damage. The stadium was located between the first front lines and endured heavy fighting. Bosnian Serbs' forces burned down the wooden grandstand under which all the club facilities were located consequently burning down most of the clubs records and trophies in the process as well. It was not until 2 May 1996 that a football match would be played on Grbavica Stadium again. Symbolically, the first match after the war was the Sarajevo derby. The wooden grandstand that burned up during the war was never fully reconstructed and on its place, {{on the west side}} of the stadium, a much smaller wodden stand was built under which, yet again, all the club <b>facilites</b> are located. In 2016 the wooden stand was reconstructed and slightly expanded in a way that all the wood elements were replaced with anti-slip metal in order to meet the UEFA Stadium requirements.|$|E

We support this claim by demonstrating a strona relationship between junctural phonotactics and affix productivity. Affixes which tend to create phonotactic junctures which <b>facilite</b> parsing also tend to be more productive. We show that there is a strong statisticol relationship between factors relating to phonotactics, and those relating to productivity. We further show that factors relating to productivity are themselves highly inter-correlated. A Principal Components Analysis reveals that affixes can be assessed on two dimensions, which we label parsability nnd usefuiness. Both of these dimensions substantially contribute to overall productivity. ...|$|R
