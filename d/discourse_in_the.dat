Important mathematical theories and axioms were postulated by Mahaviracharya, {{a native of}} Gulbarga, who belonged to the Karnataka mathematical tradition and was patronised by King Amoghavarsha I. His greatest contribution was Ganitasarasangraha, a writing in 9 chapters. Somadevasuri of 950 wrote {{in the court of}} Arikesari II, a feudatory of Rashtrakuta Krishna III in Vemulavada. He was the author of Yasastilaka champu, Nitivakyamrita and other writings. The main aim of the champu writing was to propagate Jain tenets and ethics. The second writing reviews the subject matter of Arthashastra from the standpoint of Jain morals in a clear and pithy manner. Ugraditya, a Jain ascetic from Hanasoge in the modern Mysore district wrote a medical treatise called Kalyanakaraka. He delivered a <b>discourse</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> court of Amoghavarsha I encouraging abstinence from animal products and alcohol in medicine.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every <b>discourse,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

40|$|Researchers have {{identified}} the existence of Islamic <b>discourses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> texts of the traditional Bali literature since a long time ago; however, attention has not been properly paid to them. It has been identified {{that a number of}} oral texts (kesusastraan gantian) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forms of poem and prose contain Islamic discourses. Likewise, a number of written texts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of manuscripts (kesusastraan sasuratan) have also been identified to contain the same literary genre. Historically, the texts containing Islamic <b>discourses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> traditional Balinese literature belong to the Old Balinese literature (kesusastraan Bali purwa) rather than the Modern Balinese literature (kesusastraan Bali anyar). The most striking phenomenon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> existence of the texts of Islamic <b>discourses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> traditional Balinese literature is their relationship to other texts. Explicitly, several texts in their manuscripts direct their readers {{in such a way that}} they will consider them related to other texts. <b>In</b> other words, <b>the</b> texts with Islamic <b>discourses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> traditional Balinese literature are the transformed ones reflecting the fact of intertextuality. This present study was intended to give a general picture of the intertextual relationship of the texts with Islamic discourses to other texts; their relationship to the texts within the discursive scope of the Balinese culture and the other texts which belong to the treasures of the traditional Javanese literature and the Old Malay literature.  </p...|$|R

25|$|Human {{security}} and humanitarian action also shared {{a similar process}} of evolution. The rise of the human security <b>discourse</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s paralleled an equally rapid expansion in humanitarian roles and a broadening in the objectives of humanitarianism that was labeled the ‘new humanitarianism’. Humanitarian assistance, once encompassing a narrow set of emergency based life saving interventions conducted by {{a small group of}} relatively independent actors, became ‘an organising principle for intervention in internal conflicts, a tool for peacebuilding and the starting-point for addressing poverty, as well as a palliative in times of conflict and crisis.’ It also merged with development concerns such as the promotion of social justice and societal cohesion.|$|E

After Suharto's removal from power, many people, including those involved, told other versions of the events in various books and films.

25|$|While Dutch {{society has}} a history of support for liberal values, it has not been immune to what can be {{regarded}} as a broader international trend toward the practice of racial profiling and increased levels of police violence towards racial minorities. Suspicion and mistrust of some racial groups is evident, and is perpetuated by police attitudes at all levels of command. This trend in police behaviour has drawn comment from Amnesty International, which in a 2015 report describes Dutch law enforcement officers as having a tendency to correlate suspicious criminal behaviour with specific ethnic characteristics, most notably those typical of persons of Moroccan heritage. Current political <b>discourse</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands often supports the notion of inferiority of some cultures and is evidenced by the growth in support for far right political ideologies in recent decades.|$|E
25|$|From the {{election}} of Mahmud Ahmedinijad as Iranian President, the Islamic Republic of Iran has actively supported numerous Arab organizations opposing Israel and has also actively called for waging war against it. Iran was widely referred as attempting to create a Shi'a Islam dominated axis, including the Syrian Ba'athist government, dominated by Alawites, Lebanon with Hezbollah dominance and making a strategic alliance with Sunni Hamas in Gaza Strip, which lasted until 2012 (terminating due to Shi'a - Sunni <b>discourse</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Syrian civil war). In January 2007, concerns increased among Israel's leaders that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran might be planning some sort of nuclear arms buildup, which might be considered for use in opposition to Israel. The Security Council voted to put sanctions on Iran for its pursuit of nuclear technology. There was evidence that international sanctions were creating discontent among Iranians with Ahmadinejad's policies.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue of}} Muslim {{presence}} on {{the territory of the}} two countries is often viewed in relation to the relations between the Ottoman Sultans and local Princes. Romanian historiography has generally claimed that the latter two were bound by bilateral treaties with the Porte. One of the main issues was that of Capitulations (Ottoman Turkish: ahdnâme), which were supposedly agreed between the two states and the Ottoman Empire {{at some point in the}} Middle Ages. Such documents have not been preserved: modern Romanian historians have revealed that Capitulations, as invoked in the 18th and 19th centuries to invoke Romanian rights vis à vis the Ottomans, and as reclaimed by nationalist <b>discourse</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, were forgeries. Traditionally, Ottoman documents referring to Wallachia and Moldavia were unilateral decrees issued by the Sultan. In one compromise version published in 1993, Romanian historian Mihai Maxim argues that, although these were unilateral acts, they were viewed as treaties by the Wallachian and Moldavian rulers.|$|E
