Along with Charmander and Squirtle, Bulbasaur is a starter Pokémon the player {{can choose from}} at the {{beginning}} of the games. Bulbasaur's Grass type is in contrast to Charmander's <b>Fire</b> <b>type</b> and Squirtle's Water type. Bulbasaur and the other starters from Red and Blue are replaced by Pikachu in Pokémon Yellow, the only starter available in it. Instead, they are obtained throughout the game from several trainers. In Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, remakes of Red and Green, Bulbasaur is selectable as a starter Pokémon once again, along with Charmander and Squirtle. In Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, after obtaining all sixteen badges and defeating Red, the player can choose to obtain either Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle. In Pokémon X and Y, players can also choose between Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle near the start of the game shortly after having chosen the games' new starter Pokémon.|$|E
50|$|Fire {{has been}} one of the most {{important}} factors shaping the composition and development of boreal forest stands (Rowe 1955); it is the dominant stand-renewing disturbance through much of the Canadian boreal forest (Amiro et al. 2001). The fire history that characterizes an ecosystem is its fire regime, which has 3 elements: (1) <b>fire</b> <b>type</b> and intensity (e.g., crown fires, severe surface fires, and light surface fires), (2) size of typical fires of significance, and (3) frequency or return intervals for specific land units (Heinselman 1981). The average time within a fire regime to burn an area equivalent to the total area of an ecosystem is its fire rotation (Heinselman 1973) or fire cycle (Van Wagner 1978). However, as Heinselman (1981) noted, each physiographic site tends to have its own return interval, so that some areas are skipped for long periods, while others might burn two-times or more often during a nominal fire rotation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{bandwidth}} {{required to}} receive APT transmissions is approximately 34 kHz. Most older scanners (police and <b>fire</b> <b>type</b> receivers) are the standard 15 kHz bandwidth which {{were designed to}} support voice transmissions. Newer VHF general coverage receivers are equipped with multiple IF bandpasses; some are, but not limited to: 6 kHz, 15 kHz 50 kHz & 230 kHz(broadcast FM). Use of a receiver with too narrow a bandwidth will produce pictures that are saturated in the blacks and whites, as well as possible inversion. Too wide, and the noise floor of the receiver will be too high to acquire a good picture. For the amateur enthusiast, a computer controller receiver is the best option to allow the software to automatically tune and set the required modes for proper reception.

40|$|Fires in croplands, plantations, and rangelands {{contribute}} significantly to fire emissions in the United States, yet are often overshadowed by wildland fires in efforts to develop inventories or estimate responses to climate change. Here we quantified decadal trends, interannual variability, and seasonality of Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations of active fires (thermal anomalies) {{as a function of}} management type in the contiguous U. S. during 2001 – 2010. We used the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity database to identify active fires within the perimeter of large wildland fires and land cover maps to identify active fires in croplands. A third class of fires defined as prescribed/other included all residual satellite active fire detections. Large wildland fires were the most variable of all three <b>fire</b> <b>types</b> and had no significant annual trend in the contiguous U. S. during 2001 – 2010. Active fires in croplands, in contrast, increased at a rate of 3. 4 % per year. Cropland and prescribed/other <b>fire</b> <b>types</b> combined were responsible for 77 % of the total active fire detections within the U. S and were most abundant in the south and southeast. In the west, cropland active fires decreased at a rate of 5. 9 % per year, likely in response to intensive air quality policies. Potential evaporation was a dominant regulator of the interannual variability of large wildland fires, but had a weaker influence on the other two <b>fire</b> <b>types.</b> Our analysis suggests {{it may be possible to}} modify landscape fire emissions within the U.

A method for forest fires classification exploits their computed acoustic emission spectrum compared with a set of samples of the typical fire acoustic emission spectrum stored in the database. This method implies acquisition acoustic data using Wireless Sensors Networks (WSNs) and their analysis in a central processing and a control center. The paper deals with an algorithm which can be directly implemented on a sensor network node that will allow reducing considerably the network traffic and increasing its efficiency. It is hereby suggested to use the sum of the squares ratio, with regard to amplitudes of low and high frequencies of the wildfire acoustic emission spectrum, as the indicator of a forest <b>fire</b> <b>type.</b> It is shown that the value of the crown fires indicator is several times higher than that of the surface ones.

Fire frequency (fire rotation, defined as the time needed for {{an area the size}} of the study area to burn, is the areal equivalent) and either <b>fire</b> <b>type</b> or severity (as a surrogate for intensity) are often used by ecologists to characterize different fire regimes (e.g., frequent, low severity; infrequent, high severity; etc.) as they are relatively easily measured, and their relationship is broadly inverse and fairly well understood (Heinselman 1978, Hardy et al. 2001, Steel et al. 2015).|$|E

A rational interaction model based on the Rankine approach is used to estimate column capacity {{as a function of}} fire exposure time. Various factors were considered in the analysis such as <b>fire</b> <b>type,</b> load ratio, reinforcement ratio, cover, concrete strength, load eccentricity, and other parameters.

The firing rates of cortical neurons change in time; yet, {{some aspects of}} their in vivo firing characteristics remain unchanged and are specific to individual neurons. A recent study has shown that neurons in the monkey medial motor areas can be grouped into 2 <b>firing</b> <b>types,</b> “likely random ” and “quasi-regular, ” according to a measure of local variation of interspike intervals. In the present study, we extended this analysis to area TE of the inferior temporal cortex and addressed whether this classification applies generally to different cortical areas and whether different types of neurons show different laminar distribution. We found that area TE did consist of 2 groups of neurons with different firing characteristics, one similar to the “likely random ” type in the medial motor cortical areas, and the other exhibiting a “clumpybursty” firing pattern unique to TE. The quasi-regular type was rarely observed in area TE. The likely random <b>firing</b> <b>type</b> of neuron was more frequently found in layers V–VI than in layers II–III, whereas the opposite was true for the clumpy-bursty <b>firing</b> <b>type.</b> These results show that neocortical areas consist of heterogeneous neurons that differ from one area to another in their basic firing characteristics. Moreover, we show that spike trains obtained from a single cortical neuron can provide a clue that helps to identify its layer localization...|$|R

30|$|Our {{meta-analysis}} {{suggested that}} fungal richness was unaffected by <b>fire</b> <b>type,</b> a surprising result given numerous individual studies {{that found that}} higher severity burns diminish fungal diversity {{to a greater degree}} (Dahlberg et al. 2001, Smith et al. 2004, Rincón and Pueyo 2010, Hewitt et al. 2013, Persiani and Maggi 2013, Motiejūnaitė et al. 2014). The lack of significance in our meta-analytical study may be due to high variability in fire severity within each category (i.e., wildfire versus prescribed fire). For example, prescribed burning in temperate climates during different seasons (e.g., spring burns compared to fall burns) can result in large differences in fire severity within the same terrestrial ecosystem, which may result in disparate fungal responses (Smith et al. 2004). Furthermore, wildfires vary greatly in severity both within a given fire and among different fires depending on fuel loading and weather conditions (Albini 1976). Therefore, simple generalizations of fungal response to fire based on <b>fire</b> <b>type</b> may be inadequate if the severity of the burn is not measured. We recommend that future studies measure burn severity (e.g., dNBR; Miller and Thode 2007) as well as other fire characteristics (e.g., fire weather, fuel moisture, etc.) to more accurately compare the effects of fire on fungal communities across studies.|$|E

Additionally, NO was detected during the well-ventilated tests and NH 3 during the under-ventilated tests. This agrees with the fact that oxidation of NH 3 and HCN to NO (and NO 2, although it was not analysed in these experiments) would occur more readily during well-ventilated burning.

30|$|Analysis {{of complex}} spatio-temporal fire data is an {{important}} tool to assist the management and study of fire regimes. For fire ecologists, a useful visual aid to identify contrasting fire regimes is to map temporal sequences of data such as fire return intervals, seasons, and types (planned versus unplanned fire) across the landscape. However, most of the programs that map this information are costly and complex, requiring specialist training. We present a simple yet novel method for creating sequences of temporal data for mapping fire regimes using basic geographic information system (GIS) techniques and logical test functions in Microsoft® Excel 2003 (Microsoft, Bellevue, Washington, USA). Using fire history data (1972 to 2005) for southwestern Australia, we assigned integer classifications to fire return intervals (short, moderate, and long) and <b>fire</b> <b>types</b> and seasons (wildfires and prescribed burns in different seasons) and joined the integer classifications {{together to form a}} sequence of numbers representing the order of either fire return intervals or fire seasons in reverse time sequence. This sequence can be mapped in a GIS environment so that spatial dimensions formed by overlapping polygons are readily observed, and the temporal sequence of fire data within each polygon can be interpreted across the landscape. We applied the technique to examine experimental design options for investigating the effects of contrasting fire regimes on biota at the landscape scale. This investigation identified several important factors: 1) patterns were evident in <b>fire</b> <b>types</b> and seasons, 2) patterns were evident for fire return interval sequences, and 3) combining <b>fire</b> <b>types</b> and seasons with fire return intervals significantly constrained options for the study design. A visual analysis of this <b>type</b> highlights <b>fire</b> regime patterns in the landscape and permits a feasibility study for the development of study design options and the spatial arrangement of potential study sites.|$|R
