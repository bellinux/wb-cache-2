2500|$|On July 22, 1968, a riot {{between rival}} teenage gangs {{broke out in}} {{downtown}} Mexico City. Most members of these gangs were students at the Vocational Schools #2 and #5 pitted against members enrolled at the Isaac Ochotorena preparatory school. The fight started when the former threw stones at the glass windows of the latter school. The riots resumed the following day. Answering the call to restore order, the police entered with force into Vocational School #5; claiming that it was to capture members of street gangs who had enrolled in the school. The granaderos (riot police) were used by the Mexican government to control and suppress the student demonstrators and they were first used against the students in July 1968. However, the riot police assaulted numerous students and teachers {{in the process of}} clearing Vocational School #5. In an <b>informal</b> <b>interview</b> with some granaderos, Antonio Careaga recounted that, [...] "the granaderos said that the authorities gave the men in the riot squad thirty pesos (three dollars) for every student they clubbed and hauled off to jail." ...|$|E
