5|$|Leicester {{also built}} a loggia, or open gallery, beside the great keep {{to lead to}} the new formal gardens. The loggia was {{designed}} to elegantly frame the view as the observer slowly admired the gardens, and was a new <b>design</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 16th century, only recently imported from Italy.|$|E

5|$|The {{adoption}} of steam power {{was only one}} of a number of technological advances which revolutionized warship <b>design</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th century. The ship of the line was overtaken by the ironclad: powered by steam, protected by metal armor, and armed with guns firing high-explosive shells.|$|E

5|$|A {{handful of}} {{rooms in the}} modern State Apartments reflect either 18th-century or Victorian Gothic design. The State Dining Room, for example, whose current design {{originates}} from the 1850s but which was badly damaged during the 1992 fire, is restored to its appearance in the 1920s, before the removal {{of some of the}} gilded features on the pilasters. Anthony Salvin's Grand Staircase is also of mid-Victorian <b>design</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gothic style, rising to a double-height hall lit by an older 18th-century Gothic vaulted lantern tower called the Grand Vestibule, designed by James Wyatt and executed by Francis Bernasconi. The staircase has been criticised by historian John Robinson as being a distinctly inferior design to the earlier staircases built on the same site by both Wyatt and May.|$|E
5|$|Beyond architecture, Burges {{designed}} metalwork, sculpture, jewellery, {{furniture and}} stained glass. Art Applied to Industry, {{a series of}} lectures he gave to the Society of Arts in 1864, illustrates the breadth of his interests; the topics covered including glass, pottery, brass and iron, gold and silver, furniture, the weaver's art and external architectural decoration. For most of the century following his death, Victorian architecture was neither the subject of intensive study nor sympathetic attention and Burges's work was largely ignored. However the revival of interest in Victorian art, architecture, and <b>design</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> later twentieth century {{has led to a}} renewed appreciation of Burges and his work.|$|E
5|$|Bruce's {{early work}} {{involved}} advising clients and rebuilding existing houses, rather than designing new buildings from scratch. Panmure House and Leslie House (seat of the Earl of Rothes) had been projects of the king's master mason John Mylne. At Panmure, although Bruce has {{been credited with}} the <b>design</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, the works were overseen by Alexander Nisbet, although Bruce did design the gates and gate piers. At Leslie, Bruce oversaw the works after Mylne's death, and probably made his own amendments. Panmure was demolished in the 1950s, and {{only a small part}} of Leslie House remains standing, following a fire in the 18th century. Bruce later advised the Duke of Queensberry regarding his plans for Drumlanrig Castle.|$|E

5|$|Dawkins is an atheist, and is {{well known}} for his {{criticism}} of creationism and intelligent <b>design.</b> <b>In</b> <b>The</b> Blind Watchmaker (1986), he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. In The God Delusion (2006), Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion. He opposes the teaching of creationism in schools.|$|E
5|$|Harry's Walls are {{the remains}} of an {{unfinished}} artillery fort, started in 1551 {{by the government of}} Edward VI to defend the island of St Mary's in the Isles of Scilly. Constructed to defend the harbour of Hugh Town from possible French attack, the fortification incorporated Italianate-style bastions with protective orillons and would have been the most advanced <b>design</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kingdom at the time. It was not completed, probably due to a shortage of funds and the passing of the invasion threat, and only the south-west side remains. In the 21st century, Harry's Walls are managed by English Heritage and open to visitors.|$|E

5|$|Innovation {{policies}} have been excessively focused on the supply of technologies, neglecting the demand side (the user). There have been several initiatives by the European Commission to support and research design and design management in recent years. However, a European-wide policy to support design has never been planned, due to the inconsistencies and differences in design policies in each nation. Nonetheless, there are currently plans to include <b>design</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> EU innovation policy.|$|E
5|$|Ironclads were {{designed}} for several roles, including as high seas battleships, coastal defense ships, and long-range cruisers. The rapid development of warship <b>design</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden-hulled vessel that carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel-built, turreted battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century. This change was pushed forward {{by the development of}} heavier naval guns (the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea at the time), more sophisticated steam engines, and advances in metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to calculate eigenvalues, {{one for each of}} the four state variables (lean angle, lean rate, steer angle, and steer rate), from the linearized equations in order to analyze the normal modes and self-stability of a particular bike <b>design.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> plot to the right, eigenvalues of one particular bicycle are calculated for forward speeds of 0–10m/s (22mph). When the real parts of all eigenvalues (shown in dark blue) are negative, the bike is self-stable. When the imaginary parts of any eigenvalues (shown in cyan) are non-zero, the bike exhibits oscillation. The eigenvalues are point symmetric about the origin and so any bike design with a self-stable region in forward speeds will not be self-stable going backwards at the same speed.|$|E

5|$|Motte-and-bailey castles {{became a}} less popular <b>design</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-medieval period. In France, {{they were not}} built {{after the start of}} the 12th century, and mottes ceased to be built in most of England after around 1170, {{although}} they continued to be erected in Wales and along the Marches. Many motte-and-bailey castles were occupied relatively briefly; in England many had been abandoned or allowed to lapse into disrepair by the 12th century. In the Low Countries and Germany, a similar transition occurred in the 13th and 14th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Red, {{white and}} blue have been the colours of every jersey <b>design</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> club's history; however, the jersey design has {{undergone}} several alterations. The red, {{white and blue}} colour scheme has traditionally been the colour combination of sporting teams representing Sydney's Eastern Suburbs. Eastern Suburbs Rugby League club adopted these colours in 1908, with its predecessor Rugby Union club, also known as Eastern Suburbs in the Sydney club Rugby Union, having played in the tri-colours. The jersey worn in the first premiership season consisted of several hoops; red stripes dominated over consecutive smaller white and blue stripes. Although the width and the order of these stripes have changed, the basic design has always been maintained.|$|E
5|$|The Lake Hefner Parkway {{opened in}} 1992. SH-74 was {{transferred}} to the new freeway on April 6. Between April and July 2001, ODOT installed a Brifen Safety Fence cable barrier along the Lake Hefner Parkway section of SH-74. This installation was the first application of this barrier <b>design</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. The freeway was extended from its former terminus just north of the Kilpatrick Turnpike to 164th Street in 2016.|$|E

5|$|The Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 {{also brought}} about some {{restoration}} of churches and cathedrals {{such as that}} at Lichfield by Sir William Wilson, and their enrichment with new fittings, new church plate and many elaborate memorials. The loss of the ancient St. Paul’s Cathedral in the Great Fire of London in 1666 meant that an entirely new cathedral, the present St Paul’s, was built on its site to a <b>design</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Baroque style by Sir Christopher Wren.|$|E
5|$|The {{architect}} of Woodlea is variously stated as McKim, Mead & White, and Stanford White, although according to William Mitchell Kendall in his 1920 {{list of the}} firm's works, he attributes the house's design to McKim, Mead & White, with W. R. Mead as the supervising architect. Mead was rarely involved in architectural <b>design</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> partnership, making his design of Woodlea and another Vanderbilt house, Florham, unusual. He was related to Shepard, as Mead's sister was married to Shepard's brother.|$|E
5|$|The architects {{sought to}} create an approachable {{building}} that reflected {{the role of the}} PUB as a public supplier of gas and electricity, and this led them to choose strong horizontal elements for the <b>design.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> building's façade, this is achieved with distinctive rows of vertical fins, staggered so as to emphasise horizontal movement; these fins also provide shade. A secondary horizontal pattern results from grouping two or more rows of these fins in blocks.|$|E
