5|$|Being {{located just}} inside the Lions' Gate, {{one of the major}} <b>entries</b> <b>to</b> the Old City, the East Jerusalem Development Company {{initially}} intended to excavate the reservoir and build a multi-storey car park at the site. This post-1967 plan was rejected by the waqf authorities who own the plot because they feared that clearance work {{at the base of the}} Temple Mount would endanger the Haram compound. Subsequently, in 1981 a small square equipped with benches was constructed on part of the covered pool.|$|E
5|$|In March 1990, Conway {{became an}} {{experimental}} bone marrow donor for Mark Stevenson, a 4-year-old with Hunter syndrome. The operation – {{the first of}} its kind involving an unrelated donor – was a success, allowing Mark to live to 24. Conway became an active volunteer for the National Marrow Donor Program, claiming to have helped add over 500 <b>entries</b> <b>to</b> their donor registry.|$|E
5|$|In the end a {{total of}} 28 {{architectural}} firms registered their intent to submit <b>entries</b> <b>to</b> the competition—a lower number than expected, but Richardson suggests {{this may have been}} due to work on proposals for the new Adelaide railway station. Out of those 28, {{a total of}} 26 firms submitted designs by the deadline. On 10 November 1924, before judging could be completed, the Richards Building in Currie Street was destroyed by fire, taking with it all 26 proposals.|$|E
50|$|Ganei Tikva {{has three}} access roads. On the west, the main <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> Ganei Tikva through Kiryat Ono. This is the {{preferred}} <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> Tel Aviv. On the east, through Gat Rimon which allows fast <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> Petah Tikva and Highway 6 through Route 471.|$|R

50|$|The main <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> the {{building}} is from Creek Street by a recently constructed ramp structure that abuts the verandah. A centrally located set of French doors form the main <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> the school however there are also two single leaf doors located {{either side of the}} main doors providing a secondary <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> the hall and separate <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> the enclosed verandah and area that was once the library. A secondary access to the hall is provided via a timber stair which adjoins the southern enclosed verandah.|$|R
5|$|Kind Hearts and Coronets was {{nominated}} for the British Academy Film Award for Best British Film, alongside Passport to Pimlico and Whisky Galore!, although they lost to The Third Man (1949).

5|$|The Punch {{serialisation}} {{ended in}} May 1889 with the diary entry for 21 March, which records the Pooters {{and their friends}} celebrating the minor triumph of Lupin's appointment as a clerk at Perkupps. That was the intended end of the diary; however, when the writers were preparing the manuscript for publication as a book, they added a further four months' <b>entries</b> <b>to</b> the text, and included 26 illustrations by Weedon Grossmith.|$|E
5|$|The Second Chance round (Andra chansen) is {{the fifth}} heat in which the {{remaining}} four <b>entries</b> <b>to</b> the final are chosen. The third- and fourth-placed songs from each semifinal (eight songs in total) compete in the event. The first Second Chance round in 2002 had a panel of former winners decide the two finalists. Between 2003 and 2006, the semifinal performances were re-broadcast, and a round of voting narrowed the songs to three or four. Another round then determined the two finalists. The programme was broadcast on the Sunday afternoon after the fourth semifinal. It was held in a smaller venue than those that would have hosted the semifinals—such as Berns Salonger in Stockholm, which hosted the Second Chance round in 2005.|$|E
50|$|Early 1980s: Sipson Farm's farm {{buildings}} were demolished {{and replaced by}} a residential road called Russell Gardens. The <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> the farm became the <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> 335 Sipson Road.|$|R

5|$|Traditionally {{the contest}} {{will consist of}} an opening {{ceremony}} in which the performers are welcomed to the event, the performances of the entries, a recap of the songs to help televoting viewers decide which <b>entries</b> <b>to</b> vote for, an interval act usually performed after the televoting has closed, {{the results of the}} televoting or back-up jury voting which is then followed by the declaration of the winner and a reprise of the winning song. At various points throughout the show, networks may opt out for a few minutes to screen a commercial break.|$|E
5|$|While {{teaching}} at the Niedermeyer school Saint-Saëns put less of his energy into composing and performing, but after he left in 1865 he pursued both aspects of his career with vigour. In 1867 his cantata Les noces de Prométhée beat {{more than a hundred}} other <b>entries</b> <b>to</b> win the composition prize of the Grande Fête Internationale in Paris, for which the jury included Auber, Berlioz, Gounod, Rossini and Giuseppe Verdi. In 1868 he premiered the first of his orchestral works to gain a permanent place in the repertoire, his Second Piano Concerto. Playing this and other works he became a noted figure in the musical life of Paris and other cities in France and abroad during the 1860s.|$|E
5|$|The Amaury Sport Organisation {{announced}} the wildcard <b>entries</b> <b>to</b> the Tour de France in January, much earlier in than in past years. Cofidis, who {{had participated in}} the Tour every year of their existence, were among the four teams added to the 18 UCI ProTeams obligated to attend. After not racing the Tour in 2010 and indicating {{at the time that he}} may not return to it, Moncoutié decided instead to ride the 2011 Tour with hopes of winning the King of the Mountains title. The decision put a bit of doubt to his potential return to the Vuelta a España, notwithstanding the team needing a wildcard for that race as well, in spite of his three-year string of winning the mountains classification at that race. Taaramäe, Dumoulin, El Fares, and Vogondy were also named to the squad.|$|E
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of nations which provide visa-free <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> Estonian citizens with an Estonian passport do not allow visa-free <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> holders of the Estonian alien's passport, who are not Estonian citizens.|$|R
50|$|ESTA {{does not}} {{guarantee}} <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> the United States. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers make final determination of admissibility (<b>entry)</b> <b>to</b> the United States and may cancel/deny ESTA {{at any time during}} travel.|$|R

5|$|The Amaury Sport Organisation {{announced}} the wildcard <b>entries</b> <b>to</b> the Tour de France in January, {{much earlier than}} in past years. Team Europcar had among their number French national champion Voeckler, though he lost that title shortly before the Tour, a de facto national hero after he wore the yellow jersey for ten days in the 2004 Tour de France. Confident of their inclusion, they were indeed among the four teams added to the 18 UCI ProTeams obligated to attend. Voeckler was named as the squad leader, with Charteau and Kern his top support riders. Gène was also named to the squad, the first black rider in the Tour's history. The team started quietly, with no rider finishing {{near the front of}} the race on stage 1 at the Mont des Alouettes and 13th of 22 teams in the stage 2 team time trial. The team did not really figure into the sprint finishes that happened early in the Tour, having left their best sprinter Chavanel off the squad for the Tour. Turgot's eighth place in stage 7 was their highest such finish.|$|E
5|$|The {{shattered}} 3rd Battalion traveled back to Chinju to {{join the}} 19th Infantry Regiment. There it was disbanded and its remaining men {{were assigned to the}} 19th Infantry Regiment, which itself had suffered heavy losses. Meanwhile, the 1st Battalion, 29th Infantry was sent to Anui to the north, where it was attacked and pushed back repeatedly by the North Korean 4th Infantry Division. On July 31, the North Korean 6th Infantry Division struck Chinju, pushing back the 19th Infantry Regiment and the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry, forcing them to withdraw east. This left the southern <b>entries</b> <b>to</b> Pusan open, but the North Korean 6th Division was unable to exploit it due to its extended supply line. The 6th Division eventually advanced further east, attempting to capture the city of Masan, but newly reorganized troops of the US Army repulsed them and inflicted heavy casualties on them less than a week later during the Battle of the Notch.|$|E

5000|$|Double-entry {{bookkeeping}}, in accounting, is {{a system}} of bookkeeping so named because every <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> an account requires a corresponding and opposite <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> a different account. For instance, recording earnings of $100 would require making two entries: a debit <b>entry</b> of $100 <b>to</b> an account named [...] "Cash" [...] and a credit <b>entry</b> of $100 <b>to</b> an account named [...] "Revenue." ...|$|R

50|$|An entry certificate, under United Kingdom (UK) {{immigration}} legislation, is an <b>entry</b> clearance issued <b>to</b> a non-visa national. Certain {{types of}} <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> the UK require the person seeking <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> have prior clearance {{before entering the}} UK, and because a non-visa national cannot be issued a visa, an entry certificate is issued instead.|$|R
