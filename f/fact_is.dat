5|$|Errors as to {{precedent}} facts, {{sometimes called}} jurisdictional facts, in Singapore administrative law are errors committed by public authorities concerning facts that must objectively exist or not exist before the authorities {{have the power}} to take actions or make decisions under legislation. If an error concerning a precedent <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> made, the statutory power has not been exercised lawfully and may be quashed by the High Court if judicial review is applied for by an aggrieved person. The willingness of the Court to review such errors of <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> an exception to the general rule that the Court only reviews errors of law.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} the scope of review of the {{discretion}} conferred by sections 8 and 10 of the ISA {{is limited to the}} traditional administrative law grounds of illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety as established in the House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1984), also known as the GCHQ case. The Court noted that the scope of judicial review depends on whether a jurisdictional or precedent <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> involved. Where no jurisdictional <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> involved, the scope of review is limited to the GCHQ grounds. Where a jurisdictional fact issue arises, the scope of review extends to deciding whether the precedent fact has been established. Whether a particular discretionary power is subject to any jurisdictional fact depends on the construction of the legislation which creates that power.|$|E

5|$|An error as to a jurisdictional, or precedent, <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> an {{exception}} to the general rule that the High Court does not judicially review errors of fact. Under the threefold classification of the broad grounds of judicial review set out in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ("the GCHQ case", 1983) – illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety – an error as to a precedent fact may be regarded as a form of illegality.|$|E
5|$|Eshmun was {{identified}} with Asclepius {{as a result}} of the Hellenic influence over Phoenicia; the earliest evidence of this equation is given by coins from Amrit and Acre from the third century BC. This <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> exemplified by the Hellenized names of the Awali river which was dubbed Asclepius fluvius, and the Eshmun Temple's surrounding groves, known as the groves of Asclepius.|$|E
5|$|Figs {{flower and}} fruit asynchronously. Flowering and fruiting is {{staggered}} throughout the population. This <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> important for fig wasps—female wasps {{need to find}} a syconium in which to lay their eggs within a few days of emergence, something that would not be possible if all the trees in a population flowered and fruited at the same time. This also makes figs important food resources for frugivores (animals that feed nearly exclusively on fruit); figs {{are one of the few}} fruit available at times of the year when fruit are scarce.|$|E
40|$|A {{sophisticated}} {{natural language}} system requires a large knowledge base. A methodology is described for constructing {{one in a}} principled way. <b>Facts</b> <b>are</b> selected for the knowledge base by determining what <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> linguistically presupposed by a text {{in the domain of}} interest.

5|$|In the United Kingdom, the House of Lords {{has held}} {{that the nature of}} the {{decision-making}} process that the public authority is required to engage in determines whether a matter falls into the precedent fact category. If the process is complex and much discretion is accorded to the authority by the empowering statute, the court is unlikely to find that a precedent <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> involved. On the other hand, where an administrative decision interferes with an individual's liberty, the matter will be considered within the precedent fact category unless Parliament has explicitly excluded judicial review. If Parliament intends to do so, it must make its meaning crystal clear.|$|E

5000|$|Finally, {{against the}} strong theory {{and for the}} weak theory, Searle insists, [...] "it could not be the case, as some have maintained, that all <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> {{institutional}} social <b>facts,</b> that there <b>are</b> no brute <b>facts,</b> because the structure of institutional facts reveals that they are logically dependent on brute facts. To suppose that all <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> institutional social would produce an infinite regress or circularity {{in the account of}} institutional facts. In order that some <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> institutional, there must <b>be</b> other <b>facts</b> that <b>are</b> brute physical, biological, natural. This is the consequence of the logical structure of institutional facts.".|$|R
50|$|Mental facts {{include such}} things as perceptions, feelings, and judgments.

Thus, mental <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> based on physical facts, and both physical and mental <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> required {{for the construction of}} social reality.|$|R

5|$|Strasburg {{has a high}} strikeout rate of 11.2 per 9 innings {{through his}} first 251⅓ MLB innings. This {{corresponds}} with high swing-and-miss rates across all of his pitches, including 54% on his changeup—the highest whiff rate among all starting pitchers' changeups since PITCHf/x began tracking pitches. Through the 2012 season, Strasburg's career strikeout-to-walk ratio of 4.67 would rank second all-time if he had enough innings to qualify. Strasburg maintains that his high strikeout rate is not intentional, and in <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> a hindrance to maintaining low pitch counts.|$|E
5|$|The {{courts in}} Singapore have {{followed}} the legal position on errors as to precedent facts in the United Kingdom. This {{is illustrated by the}} High Court case Lau Seng Poh v. Controller of Immigration (1985), which held that if a precedent <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> a prerequisite to the exercise of executive power, the court is responsible for deciding if the precedent fact has been satisfied. This principle was affirmed by the Court of Appeal case Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), which applied the principle set out in Khawaja and its departure from the approach taken in Zamir.|$|E
40|$|What is {{the ontological}} status of facts? Are facts {{linguistic}} or extra-linguistic entities? If <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> extra-linguistic entities, are they mind-independent or relative to languages, theories or conceptual schemes? Based on a minimal definition of facts, the author argues that what are specified by true statements are not identical to true propositions expressed, so <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> not linguistic entities. Furthermore, what are specified by true statements {{are not to}} which a true statement corresponds, so <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> not mind-independent, either as concrete entities in the universe or as abstract entities {{in the world as}} it is. Last, the author presents an internal factual realist answer: although <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> neither in the world as it is, nor in a language, <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> real and exist in a world under consideration. A fact, as a non-linguistic correlate of a true statement of a language, exists in a world specified by the language...|$|R

5|$|The {{suggestion}} that the entire amount of the purchase money was not paid, and that such <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> {{in the way of}} supporting the claim to the Indian title, is not sustained. We are not called upon to consider the effect of default in payment of any portion of the purchase money. The treaty recites the payment of it, and as no such question seems ever before to have been raised, or full payment questioned, either by government or the Indians, it must at this late day be assumed, until the contrary is quite clearly made to appear, that the contract in that respect was performed.|$|E
5|$|When {{diamonds}} {{are grown}} by the high-pressure high-temperature technique, nickel, cobalt {{or some other}} metals are usually added into the growth medium to facilitate catalytically the conversion of graphite into diamond. As a result, metallic inclusions are formed. Besides, isolated nickel and cobalt atoms incorporate into diamond lattice, as demonstrated through characteristic hyperfine structure in electron paramagnetic resonance, optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra, and the concentration of isolated nickel can reach 0.01%. This <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> by all means unusual considering the large difference in size between carbon and transition metal atoms and the superior rigidity of the diamond lattice.|$|E
5|$|With {{the obvious}} {{exception}} of Brancaccio, all the singers in the concerto were female sopranos. Although the music {{written for the}} concerto focused on high voices, {{there is no evidence}} that the ensemble used either castrati or falsettists. This <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> surprising, considering that castrati were shortly to become the biggest stars of a new art form, opera. In 1607, Monteverdi's Orfeo featured four castrato roles out of a cast of nine, showing the new dominance of this vocal type. It also contrasts with Margherita's father's court, where Guglielmo Gonzaga actively sought out eunuchs.|$|E

Each WME may hold an entire n-tuple, or, alternatively, each <b>fact</b> may <b>be</b> {{represented by a}} set of WMEs where each WME contains a fixed-length tuple. In this case, tuples are typically triplets (3-tuples).|$|R
5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of the boxes, but also in the choice of the monolithic block, which, in <b>fact,</b> <b>is</b> not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system.

5|$|If the Saxbe fix is a {{solution}} for the primary problem of self-dealing, a relevant <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that Congress has not voted to increase any Cabinet salary or benefits since the 1990s, when it granted that power to {{the president in the}} form of an across-the-board cost of living adjustment by executive order. However, the Ineligibility Clause does not distinguish between increases in emoluments by legislation, and increases by executive order. Perhaps the most lenient interpretation of self-dealing was made during the 1973 Saxbe hearings by Duke University School of Law professor William Van Alstyne, who argued that the ineligibility clause only applied to new offices created during a congressional term, not to appointments to existing offices.|$|E
5|$|In early 1914, Ruth {{signed a}} {{professional}} baseball contract with Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team. The circumstances of Ruth's signing {{are not known}} with certainty; historical <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> obscured by stories that cannot all be true. By some accounts, Dunn was urged to attend a game between an all-star team from St. Mary's and one from another Xaverian facility, Mount St. Mary's College. Some versions have Ruth running away before the eagerly awaited game, to return in time to be punished, and then pitching St. Mary's to victory as Dunn watched. Others have Washington Senators pitcher Joe Engel, a Mount St. Mary's graduate, pitching in an alumni game after watching a preliminary contest between the college's freshmen and a team from St. Mary's, including Ruth. Engel watched Ruth play, then told Dunn about him at a chance meeting in Washington. Ruth, in his autobiography, stated only that he worked out for Dunn for a half-hour, and was signed. According to biographer Kal Wagenheim, there were legal difficulties to be straightened out as Ruth was supposed to remain at the school until he turned 21.|$|E
