5|$|The {{planting}} was recreated in the 1930s. No {{original plan}} of the renaissance garden survives, although records show fruit was grown in the 17th century. The garden has decorative hedges, trimmed into {{the shapes of the}} Scottish thistle, English rose, and French fleur-de-lis. Further planting is clipped into letters, spelling out the two Lindsay family mottoes, Dum Spiro Spero (while I breathe <b>I</b> <b>hope),</b> <b>and</b> Endure Forte (endure firmly).|$|E
500|$|All {{of these}} new things {{entering}} my life are changing the way I view my purpose, but 'Dance in the Dark' in particular is about me wanting to live—but also, the song isn't called 'Dance in the Light'. I'm not a gospel singer trying to cross people over. What I'm saying is, 'I get it. I feel you, I feel the same way, and it's OK.' <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> pray that I can inspire some sort of change in people subliminally through the show. They're singing 'Dance in the Dark,' but they're dancing and they're free, they're letting it out. But the songs are not about freedom, they're about [...] I get it. I feel the way you feel.|$|E
500|$|What is {{the matter}} with you that, that even after the unending admissions of guilt in [...] you cannot stop {{representing}} yourself ever more radically as a criminal for whom twenty years in prison was [...] "too little"?... {{there appears to be a}} vast and incomprehensible discrepancy between your humble confessions and your present way of life. [...] For the former would lead one to expect a Speer in sackcloth and ashes; I, however, know you as a merry fellow who undertakes one lovely journey after another and who happily regales his old chums with tales of his literary and financial successes... our accusations against your former colleagues (Göring, Goebbels, Bormann, etc.) who, being dead, cannot defend themselves are agony to me... <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> think that the day will come when you will no longer find it necessary to confess your guilt to all and sundry in order to persuade yourself of your virtue.|$|E

2500|$|He {{concluded}} {{his advice}} for fellow attorneys by quoting Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., [...] " [...] I like your rapture over the law, I only {{fear that it}} may be dimmed as you get into the actualities (in the sense of the hard side) of life. But if, as <b>I</b> <b>hope,</b> <b>and</b> as what you write indicates, you bear the fire in your belly, it will survive and transfigure the hard facts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many Roman Catholics recite prayers {{based on}} Our Lady of Fátima. Lúcia later said that, in 1916, {{she and her}} cousins had several visions of an angel calling himself the [...] "Angel of Portugal" [...] and the [...] "Angel of Peace," [...] who taught them to bow with their heads {{to the ground and}} to say [...] "My God, I believe, I adore, <b>I</b> <b>hope,</b> <b>and</b> I love you. I ask pardon {{for those who do not}} believe, do not adore, do not hope and do not love you." [...] Lúcia later set this prayer to music and a {{recording}} exists of her singing it. It was also said that sometime later, the angel returned and taught them a eucharistic devotion now known as the Angel Prayer.|$|E
2500|$|At his {{arraignment}} at the District Court of Pittsburg County on June 4, 2002, Duty asked Judge Steven Taylor {{to enter}} a guilty plea to the murder and requested the death penalty, {{against the advice of}} his defense counsel. On October 28 of that year, Duty was deemed competent to enter the plea after court-ordered evaluations by the Carl Albert Community Mental Health Center and Eastern Oklahoma State Hospital. While testifying on his own behalf, Duty declined to present any mitigating evidence and said that he preferred death over spending a life sentence in lockdown 23 hours day. He also wrote to the prosecutor that he would kill again. Mary Wise pleaded to the court to sentence Duty to life in prison without the possibility of parole, stating: [...] "I don't believe he ought to have a choice. I think he ought to sit in that cell and face those four walls and think about what he did {{for the rest of his}} natural-born life. And <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> pray to God that you live to be 110 years old, because that's how long I want you to think about what you did." [...] Judge Taylor denied her request, calling Duty a [...] "textbook case for the death penalty". Duty was initially scheduled to be executed on February 24, 2005.|$|E

6000|$|She did not protest {{this as a}} coquette {{might have}} done.

60|$|And then, suddenly, {{a dreadful}} {{possibility}} flashed through my mind. <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>and</b> prayed {{it would not}} occur to John also. I glanced sideways at him.
