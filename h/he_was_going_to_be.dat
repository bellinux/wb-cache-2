5|$|On the November 28 {{episode of}} Raw, Maria interviewed then-Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff, {{and asked him}} {{whether or not he}} thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fired. He then booked her in a match with Kurt Angle out of spite, and Maria was laid out with the Angle Slam. As a result, one week later, Maria testified in the trial against Bischoff, who was being fired because of his {{controversial}} actions as General Manager.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly {{continued}} {{to work as a}} schoolteacher after he broke into international cricket, {{but at the end of}} 1934, after missing more than six months of the year in England, he resigned from his government post, reasoning that his career could not progress if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> overseas so often. However, he had not made any plans for his future employment. Soon after, O'Reilly received an offer to work as a sportsgoods salesman for the department store David Jones with sporting leave entitlements. The Premier of New South Wales, Bertram Stevens, tried to coax O'Reilly into staying in the government education system, offering him a post at Sydney Boys High School if he returned to STC to complete the Bachelor of Arts that he had abandoned a decade before.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a slight}} delay in {{the start of the}} game as some of the glass needed to be fixed. Once the game was under way it took just 1:50 before the Crunch's Jon Mirasty and the Senators' Jeremy Yablonski engaged in the first fight in Outdoor Classic history. Mirasty had {{previously}} stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved in the first outdoor fight. The physical play continued and minutes later at the 3:29 mark Paul Baier and Mike Radja were given matching roughing minor penalties. Not long after the matching minors Mike Blunden made a pass to Alexandre Picard to send him on a breakaway. Picard became the first player to score in an Outdoor Classic when he beat Senators' goaltender Mike Brodeur putting the Crunch up 1–0. The score remained the same {{at the end of a}} penalty-filled first period. Eight total penalties were called on the two clubs through the first 20 minutes of the game.|$|E
6000|$|ALL the {{way home}} from Maine, Babbitt <b>was</b> certain that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a changed man. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> {{converted}} <b>to</b> serenity. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> cease worrying about business. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have more [...] "interests"--theaters, public affairs, reading.

25|$|The {{historian}} Boyd Hilton argues Peel {{knew from}} 1844 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> deposed as the Conservative leader. Many of his MPs {{had taken to}} voting against him, and the rupture within the party between liberals and paternalists which had been so damaging in the 1820s, but masked by the issue of parliamentary reform in the 1830s, {{was brought to the}} surface over the Corn Laws. Hilton's hypothesis is that Peel wished to actually be deposed on a liberal issue so that he might later lead a Peelite/Whig/Liberal alliance.|$|E
25|$|On October 26, 1950, Albizu Campos held a {{political}} meeting in Fajardo. After the meeting Albizu Campos received word that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> arrested {{and that his}} house in San Juan was surrounded by the police. He escaped from Fajardo and ordered the revolution to start. On October 27, the police {{in the town of}} Peñuelas, intercepted and fired upon a caravan of nationalists, killing four. On October 30, the nationalists were ordered to stage uprisings in the towns of Ponce, Mayagüez, Naranjito, Arecibo, Utuado, San Juan and Jayuya.|$|E
25|$|Growing up, Kooser {{attended}} Ames Public Schools {{for elementary}} and middle school. When Kooser arrived at Ames High School, his interest diverted from the library and went to cars. He joined the Nightcrawlers Car Club and became secretary of the group in 1956. His motivation for writing in high school can be in part credited {{to one of his}} teachers, Mary McNally, who encouraged him to continue writing essays and poems that reflected his life. Kooser decided as a teenager that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a famous poet for three reasons: glory, immortally and to leave the bohemian lifestyle behind.|$|E

However, in October, Grammer {{announced that}} Walsh had miscarried six weeks earlier.

Grammer and Walsh have a daughter, Faith Evangeline Elisa (born July 13, 2012), and two sons, Kelsey Gabriel Elias (born July 22, 2014) and Auden James Ellis born (November 14, 2016).|$|E
25|$|Upon being {{informed}} of the indictment, he urged his followers not to take any action if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sentenced to {{less than six months}} in prison, stressing that he wanted to give an example of dignity, but ordered a group of Legionaries to defend him in case of an attack by the authorities. He was arrested together with 44 other prominent members of the movement, including Ion Zelea Codreanu, Gheorghe Clime, Alexandru Cristian Tell, Radu Gyr, Nae Ionescu, Şerban Milcoveanu and Mihail Polihroniade, on the evening of April 16. The crackdown coincided with the Orthodox celebration of Palm Sunday (when all those targeted were known to be in their homes). After a short stay in the Romanian Police Prefecture, Codreanu was dispatched to Jilava prison, while the other prisoners were sent to Tismana Monastery (and later to concentration camps such as the one in Miercurea Ciuc).|$|E
25|$|On October 15, 1976, Carlo Gambino {{died of a}} heart attack. With Gambino gone, Bruno {{lost his}} most {{important}} ally in the underworld. Many of Bruno's subordinates felt that they were missing out on money because of Bruno's old-fashioned and content ways. His consigliere Antonio Caponigro approached Genovese family boss Frank Tieri in order to seek the Commission's permission to kill Bruno and take over the crime family. Tieri, sensing an opportunity to take Caponigro's north New Jersey rackets, lied to Caponigro and told him he had the Commission's support. On March 21, 1980, Bruno was shot {{in the back of the}} head while in his car by a gunman working for Caponigro. That April, Caponigro visited New York City under the assumption that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> confirmed as boss. Instead, he was tortured and murdered for killing a Commission member without permission. Caponigro's co-conspirators Frank Sindone and John Simone were also murdered in 1980.|$|E

25|$|During {{his spare}} time, Hogan worked out at Hector's Gym in the Tampa Bay area, where he began lifting. Many of the wrestlers who were {{competing}} in the Florida region visited the bars where Ruckus was performing. Among those attending his performances were Jack and Gerald Brisco, two brothers who wrestled together as a tag team in the Florida region. Impressed by Hogan's physical stature, the Brisco brothers asked Hiro Matsuda the man who trained wrestlers working for Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF) {{to make him a}} potential trainee. In 1976, the two brothers asked Hogan to try wrestling. Having been a wrestling fan since childhood, Hogan eventually agreed. At first, however, Mike Graham, the son of CWF promoter Eddie Graham, refused to put Hogan in the ring; according to Hogan, he met Graham while in high school and the two did not get along. However, after Hogan quit Ruckus and started telling people in town that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a wrestler, Graham finally agreed to accept the Brisco Brothers' request.|$|E
25|$|Blackford was {{enrolled}} in Princeton University at age sixteen and graduated {{at the top of}} his class in 1806. On his enrollment forms he entered his middle name as Newton, but never again used the name during his life. Among his fifty-four classmates were John Williams Walker, James Iradell, John James Marshall, and Patrick Noble. Blackford became fluent in Greek and Latin and excelled in history. He also spent a considerable amount of time reading legal books on English common law. After college he studied law for a year in the office of Revolutionary War hero Colonel George MacDonald before moving on in 1810 to complete his legal studies in the office of New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Gabriel Ford in Morristown. He was admitted to the bar in New Jersey that same year. He took only one case of his own and realized he needed to join a law firm if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to earn a living at his profession. He returned to his hometown and joined MacDonald's firm.|$|E
25|$|At 6:00 PM on July 23, Forbes and Beach {{drove to}} the Afro Culture Shop and Bookstore at 11105 Superior Avenue to see Evans. Not finding him there, they {{drove to the}} Evans' {{apartment}} at 12312 Auburndale Avenue and were {{surprised to discover that}} the Cleveland Police had, in fact, established a stationary surveillance around Evans' home. One unmarked car with white officers sat on Lakeview Avenue between Moulton and Auburndale, and another with white officers sat at the intersection of Auburndale and E. 124th Street. At 7:50 PM, Forbes and Beach arrived at Evans' home. They talked with him for 15 minutes, during which time Evans expressed his anxiety about the police and his concern that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> harassed again. Forbes attempted to have the stationary surveillance removed, but was advised by the city's Safety Director, James McManamon, to speak with Mayor Stokes. Forbes reached Stokes, but Stokes was interrupted by another call and asked Forbes to call back in 15 minutes. During this time, Forbes drove to the home of Harllel Jones, an Evans associate. While speaking with Jones, they learned that the shootout had begun.|$|E

25|$|After a {{promising}} 13–6 start, the Magic {{began to fall}} apart. First, Weisbrod traded Mobley for Doug Christie from the Sacramento Kings. Christie, because of his emotional ties to the Kings, at first refused {{to play for the}} Magic. Later on, Christie claimed he had bone spurs and was placed on the injured list after playing only a few games for the Magic. Near the end of the season, with a playoff-push faltering, Weisbrod fired Davis after leading Davis to believe <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the team's head coach for the entire 2004–05 NBA season. He then promoted Chris Jent to interim head coach. Throughout the season, bolstered by Hill's return, the Magic played spectacularly, defeating top NBA teams. However, led by the erratic play of Francis, the Magic also lost to league teams with losing records. Howard showed great promise, becoming one of the few players to average a double-double. Howard was a consistent rebounder and scorer, becoming the first rookie to start and play all 82 games in a season. In addition, Nelson, after a slow start, developed into a talented player, taking over the starting point guard position. Hill also returned and averaged 19.7 points a game. Hill was chosen an All-Star starter by NBA fans for the 2005 All-Star Game, and Dwight Howard and Jameer Nelson were named to the All-Rookie first and second teams, respectively. Howard was a unanimous selection.|$|E
25|$|In March 2007, Herbalife {{signed a}} five-year {{deal with the}} Galaxy, worth between $4–5million a year, to be the club's primary shirt sponsor. Four months later, the club signed David Beckham from Real Madrid. His debut was made at Home Depot Center before a record crowd of nearly 35,000, {{including}} many celebrities, coming on in the 78th minute in a 1–0 loss to Chelsea in a match during the World Series of Football tournament. The match brought unprecedented TV coverage from ESPN, who used 19 cameras to cover it, including one trained only on Beckham, {{even when he was}} on the bench. In that season's SuperLiga, LA reached the final but lost to Mexican side Pachuca on penalties after extra time. LA nearly made the end-of-season play-offs, but were eliminated following a 1–0 loss to the Chicago Fire. In the off-season, Cobi Jones retired and, amidst rumors that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sacked, Yallop resigned as head coach following a friendly match at Home Depot Center. The San Jose Earthquakes bought out his contract and offered a third round draft pick to the Galaxy as compensation to hire Yallop as their new head coach. Yallop was replaced at LA by Ruud Gullit, who signed a three-year contract with the club, making him the highest paid coach in MLS history. Cobi Jones returned as assistant coach. LA went on a promotional tour of Australia and New Zealand, setting attendance records in both countries. 80,295 people showed up at Stadium Australia for the match between Sydney FC and LA Galaxy, which the home side won 5–3. They also played a tour of Asia, and competed in the inaugural Pan-Pacific Championship in Honolulu, finishing third after beating Sydney 2–1 in the third-place match.|$|E
25|$|In May 1735, Vicente died, {{filling the}} former {{privateer}} with guilt. Attempting {{to escape the}} administration of Abadía, Enríquez took refuge in the Convent of Santo Tomás on October 30, 1735. He remained there after hearing rumors that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> jailed at El Morro. However, even there the governor pursued him. Abadía requested permission to obtain a search warrant and check if Enríquez had taken any wealth there. All of the rooms were rummaged, but nothing of worth was found. Despite this, Abadía confiscated Enríquez's correspondence. Incredulous, the former privateer requested a certification for the search warrant. Between 1735 and 1737, Enríquez wrote to Phillip V six times requesting an independent prosecutor that could launch a neutral investigation. He also offered to reorganize the now scattered privateers. However, the king never replied directly and the only response, issued by the Council of the Indies, informed him {{that they did not}} consider that action convenient. From that moment onwards, Enríquez only wrote to detail his misery and to request the payment of an old debt. During the following years, his only contact to the outside world was through the Dominican friars. To Enríquez's chagrin, Abadía had unusual longevity in the office of governor, with the Crown granting him time beyond the stipulated five years. In 1740, the Council of the Indies revised Mendizábal's case and issued a declaration restoring his honor and rank. However, they never did the same for Enríquez despite being charged as a supposed accomplice of the former governor. Most of his friend eventually left, only Paris {{and the members of the}} Church remained besides him. On June 29, 1743, Abadía died while still in office. Five months afterwards, Enríquez died a sudden death. After receiving the Extreme Unction, his body was laid to rest in a mass grave as a charity, since he was penniless and nobody paid for a burial. Only Paris and Rosa Enríquez, his unrecognized daughter who would later claim that he had been poisoned, mourned his death.|$|E
