25|$|This rock shelf, {{known in}} gold rush times as the Lower Fountain, was reputedly {{made by the}} trickster Coyote, leaping {{back and forth across}} the river to create {{platforms}} for people to catch and dry fish on. This location, named Sat' or Setl in the native language and known as the Bridge River Rapids or Six Mile in English, is the busiest fishing site on the Fraser above its mouth and there are numerous <b>drying</b> <b>racks</b> scattered around the banks of the river canyon around it.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} evidences {{that have been}} {{discovered}} {{in the last decade}} about the Hoko River Community. As archeologists are able to excavate the location and sites surround this river, more information can be gathered about the people that lived along this beautiful river banks. As mentioned in the previous passage, the wet sites provided excellent preservation for artifacts. The rock shelter and the wet sites created extension of the preservation times of these artifacts and items found alongside the river. Evidence shows that Halibut and Cod were the main species fished in this region. Hoko River community fished Halibut and Cod, the preservation of these types of fish was needed to make through the off-season months when fish was scarce. Wooden <b>drying</b> <b>racks</b> were found during one of the excavation sites along the river. The racks provided safe drying area where fish were dried in the sun. This made the preservation of the fish to be extended. Hooks, floats, and cordage were also found along the river that suggests fishing was main source of living for Hoko River Community. This also suggests that there was a social ranking was present during this time.|$|E

2500|$|Cleaning {{laboratory}} glassware is sometimes necessary {{and may be}} done using multiple methods. [...] Glassware can be soaked in a detergent solution to remove grease and loosen most contaminations. These contaminations are then scrubbed with a brush or scouring pad to remove particles which cannot be rinsed. Sturdy glassware {{may be able to}} withstand sonicated as an alternative to scrubbing. For certain sensitive experiments glassware may be soaked in solvents, such as aqua regia or mild acids, to dissolve a trace quantities of specific contaminations known to interfere with an experiment. When cleaning is finished it is common practice to triple rinse glassware before suspending it upside down on <b>drying</b> <b>racks.</b>|$|E
2500|$|An {{analysis}} of the remains at the dry site has given researchers {{a basic understanding of}} the camp layout. [...] The camps were probably occupied in the spring and summer. [...] Pierced strips of cedar bark suggest that dwellings at the camp were roofed with longs sheets of cedar and sewn tule or bulrush mats which were also found during the excavation. [...] The inhabitants would have slept on furs along the inner walls of the shed-like shelters. [...] Other structures and remains were uncovered during excavation, such as evidence of canoe runs, <b>drying</b> <b>racks</b> and poles, which were likely used as platforms in order to move the canoes from the village onto the beach.|$|E
2500|$|Fishing (creek and river) {{was done}} {{near the village}} sites, and the fish were stored in large {{subsurface}} caches and is domestic and most common. The main economical fish (Tanacross łuug Upper Tanana łuugn, łuuk) species are mostly whitefish (humpback whitefish, round whitefish Tanacross xełtįį' [...] ) and Pacific salmon (king (chinook) Upper Tanana gath Tanacross łuug chox, red (sockeye) Upper Tanana łuugn delt'al Tanacross łuug delt'el). Other fish species are pike (Upper Tanana ch'ulju̱u̱dn Tanacross uljaaddh), grayling (Lower Tanana srajela Upper Tanana seejiil Tanacross seejel), lingcod (Upper Tanana and Tanacross ts'aan) and sucker (Upper Tanana taats'adn Tanacross tats'aht'ôl). Fishing at Mansfield Lake and Fish Creek for whitefish, pike, and grayling {{began in the late}} spring and continued until mid-July and was a major harvest activity; whitifish was an especially important and perennially reliable food source. All band members except the very young children assisted in harveting and processing the catch. The spring fish harvest provided a welcome dietary change after a long winter of eating mostly dried fish and meat. Fish not eaten fresh were processed and dried on <b>drying</b> <b>racks</b> for later consumption. Both fresh and dried fish were cooked in boiling water, produced by placing heated stones into a birch bark basket.|$|E
