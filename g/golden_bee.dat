2500|$|Robert Stephens {{had kept}} bees as a hobby. After he {{returned}} from service in World War I he continued his interest. He opened a commercial honey production facility in Mole Creek in 1918. By 1923 the factory had 50 hives and was selling honey under the <b>Golden</b> <b>Bee</b> brand. Since 1951 it has concentrated on leatherwood honey. Each year hives are transported to Tasmania's west coast to make honey with the distinctive flavour of leatherwood (Eucryphia lucida and Eucryphia milliganii). The Factory and Apiary are provisionally registered on the Tasmanian Heritage Register. It has operated on the same [...] site since operations began; the oldest building is a c.1920 timber cottage and the prominent façade that faces the main road dates from the 1970s. The factory is run by Stephen's decedents using the [...] "Golden Bee" [...] label introduced in 1930 and the [...] "Golden Nectar" [...] label for leatherwood honey introduced 1951. As of 2010 it was producing [...] of honey each year and approximately 35% of all Tasmanian honey.|$|E

The tree represented growth, the bees industry, and the praetor (judge) was an heraldic pun on the name.|$|R
50|$|According to some authors, the red stripe on {{the white}} field was {{inspired}} by the colors of the flag of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany which ruled the island with the House of Medici first and the House of Habsburg-Lorraine after. Robert Christophe mentions that The Emperor himself designed the flag. During the five days of the journey, he studied some books about Elba which he brought from Fontainebleau. Inspired by the Medici coat of arms, the ancient rulers of the island, he designed a new flag with a white background and a diagonal strip with three <b>golden</b> <b>bees</b> on top. The symbol of Florence would have been appreciated by the people of Elba and the <b>golden</b> <b>bees,</b> memory of the imperial mantle, were intended as a tribute to the soldiers who, under the command of Cambronne, after crossing France, were going to reach Portoferraio 20 days after. The flag of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany under the House of Medici had, however, {{nothing to do with the}} flag of Elba with the exception of the white background while the flag of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, being red-white-red horizontal stripes, resembles the Elba flag due to the colors.|$|R

50|$|Among {{the various}} {{hypotheses}} {{about the meaning}} of bees, one is that Napoleon wanted to symbolize the unity and hard work of Elba inhabitants. Another one, however, aroused greater foundation, attributes to Napoleon himself the explanation thereof. Speaking with Admiral Thomas Ussher, he said that he chosen the three bees because they represent the people of Elba that has had three rulers and now, with me, they are finally united under a single banner. The <b>golden</b> <b>bees</b> are however, very often a symbol in the Napoleon iconography.|$|R
