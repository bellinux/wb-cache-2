40|$|Micro Finance has broadened rapidly {{since its}} {{inception}} in the late 1970 s, but scholars have divergent views whether how much it helps to poor. This research reports on the assessment of the impact of participation in microfinance. However, it is difficult to establish a causal relationship between participation and poverty indicators, because of unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality. These issues were largely avoided in the present study, which used propensity score matching and FE and RE methods to examine whether microfinance helps to reduce poverty. Using the dataset, we first estimated propensity scores for participation on several pretreatment variables. We then matched clients and non-clients on the basis of these. Next, we estimated the average treatment effect, considering participation as a treatment, and participants as the treated group. We employed different matching methods to ascertain the robustness of any effects. Besides, for the (2007 & 2009) data set, we used the FE and RE models to fully address the two major problems. We found significant impact of microfinance on household productive assets, but we did not find significant impact on <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> and monthly <b>expenditures</b> in both cases. The propensity score matching and panel data analyses identified microfinance as having direct effects on households productive and no <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> and monthly <b>expenditures...</b>|$|R

Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) in the banking sector may be in the form of amalgamation, absorption, consolidation, acquisition or take over.

40|$|Data on {{physical}} capital are an indispensable part {{of economic growth}} and efficiency studies. In the case of China, economy-wide <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> series are usually derived by aggregating gross fixed capital formation (net of depreciation) over time, and sectoral/ownership-specific series by correcting the limited official <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> data available. These procedures, to varying degrees, ignore that (i) gross fixed capital formation does not equal investment, (ii) investment does not equal the value of <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> newly created through investment, (iii) depreciation is an accounting measure that bears no necessary relation {{to changes in the}} production capacity of <b>fixed</b> <b>assets,</b> (iv) official <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> data, where available, incorporate significant revaluations in the 1990 s, and (v) "net fixed assets" do not measure the contribution of <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> to production.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{incentives}} for <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> revaluation. The motives that are investigated include firm size, <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> intensity, firm foreign operations and acquisitions, firm indebtedness and earnings management inclination. Design/methodology - The study utilises logistic and linear regressions to test the hypothetical relations set up in the study. The categorisation of sample companies into those that perform asset revaluations and those that do not is based on the examination of firms' annual reports. Findings - The findings of the study provide evidence that firm size is positively related to <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> revaluation. Firms with foreign operations, with low <b>fixed</b> <b>assets,</b> and with high debt capital needs are more likely to perform <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> revaluations. This is also the case for firms that carry out acquisitions. The study also shows that <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> revaluation is negatively related to earnings management.
