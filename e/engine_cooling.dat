5|$|The plastic fairing {{ran from}} below the {{handlebars}} {{and under the}} footpegs, protecting the rider's legs from wind and road debris, as well as hiding the engine from view. This design was like the full enclosure of a scooter, but unlike a scooter the engine and gearbox unit was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down {{and away from the}} seat, detaching the rear swingarm motion from the drivetrain for lower unsprung weight. It also made <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> air flow more direct, and made it possible to fit larger wheels. Placing the engine {{in the center of the}} frame, rather than close to the rear wheel, greatly improved front-rear balance. The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the fuel filler inlet. The 17inch wheels, in comparison to the typical 10inch wheels of a scooter, were more stable, particularly on rough roads, and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel scooter.|$|E
5|$|The aircraft's {{construction}} was a novelty for the time. In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood. Tubular radiators for <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> were located {{on either side of the}} cockpit. The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control. It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{most common}} engine types are an {{air-cooled}} <b>engine</b> or water <b>cooled</b> <b>engine.</b> Water <b>cooled</b> nowadays use antifreeze {{in the internal}} combustion engine ...|$|R

25|$|The capacious {{fuselage}} {{housed the}} crew compartments {{as well as}} the four engines and their clutches and combining gearboxes. This configuration offered the advantage that the engines could be accessed in-flight for adjustment or minor repairs. However, there were serious problems during development with <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> and vibration.|$|E
50|$|The 11 {{fresh water}} {{consists}} of 3 {{for the main}} engine jacket water, 3 for the diesel generators, 3 for the main <b>engine</b> piston <b>cooling,</b> and 2 for main <b>engine</b> nozzle <b>cooling.</b>|$|R
50|$|At the Motor Show 1925 the 14/28 {{power output}} was {{reported}} to be 34 bhp and four-wheel brakes were standard, the same car had Barker dipping headlamps and thermostatic control of its <b>engine's</b> <b>cooling</b> water.|$|R
50|$|The <b>engine's</b> <b>cooling</b> {{system now}} had {{thermostatic}} control, mixture control was now thermostatic, direction indicators self-cancelling, the {{electric windscreen wiper}} was fitted with a blade for {{each side of the}} screen, Triplex safety glass fitted throughout.|$|R
25|$|The JLTV will be {{equipped}} with a diagnostic monitoring system that will electronically alert the operator of equipment failures {{so that they can}} be fixed. The electronic monitoring will observe the fuel, air intake, <b>engine,</b> <b>cooling,</b> transmission, energy storage, power generation and vehicle speed as well as other systems.|$|E
25|$|The first P.40 {{made only}} one short flight and was then destroyed. The {{history of the}} one {{surviving}} example, OO-68, {{on display in the}} Belgian Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History in Brussels is obscure. The two machines differed a little, with varying <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> and exhaust arrangements, and OO-68 has a three, rather than two, blade propeller.|$|E
25|$|There were initial {{problems}} with the propellers, <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> systems, and air conditioning, but these were fixed before {{the completion of the}} third ship of the class. The class underwent refits during each ship's seventh or eighth year of operation, and again at the fifteenth year (which was ongoing until 2012). This has extended the predicted service life of the class to 2027.|$|E
50|$|Most {{aviation}} {{piston engines}} are air-cooled. Air <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> are lighter than their major alternative - water <b>cooled</b> <b>engines,</b> because the lower weight of air <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> in aircraft design being {{a more important}} factor than the lower drag of water <b>cooled</b> <b>engines.</b> While water <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> were widely used {{from the early days}} of flight, air <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> were the dominant choice in aircraft. Following the Second World War, turbojets and jet turbine powered aircraft have come to dominate flight regimes where water <b>cooled</b> piston <b>engines</b> offered a drag advantage. Thus today, piston engines are mostly used in slower general aviation aircraft where low weight is an advantage. Therefore, most aero engines produced today are of the air cooled variety. Today, most of the engines currently (2005) manufactured by Lycoming and Continental and used by major manufacturers of light aircraft Cirrus, Cessna and so on.|$|R

25|$|These styling {{changes were}} unpopular with many—particularly {{features}} such as the fin strakes within the primary rear-intake-ducts openings, which appeared to mimic the Ferrari Testarossa, though providing crucial improved <b>engine</b> <b>cooling.</b> Nonetheless it was only outsold by the QV model. It continued to featured 345/35R15 tyres. The Anniversary edition was produced up until 1990 before being superseded by the Lamborghini Diablo.|$|E
25|$|Testing {{revealed}} that the XB-42 suffered from some instability as excessive yaw was encountered, as well as vibration and poor <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> - all problems that could probably have been dealt with. Due to the ventral vertical stabilizer and rudder surface set's tip being located underneath the fuselage, careful handling during taxiing, takeoff, and landing was required because of limited ground clearance.|$|E
25|$|The Douglas XA-26 {{prototype}} (AAC Ser. No. 41-19504) first flew on 10 July 1942 at Mines Field, El Segundo, with {{test pilot}} Benny Howard at the controls. Flight tests revealed excellent performance and handling, but <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> problems led to cowling changes and {{elimination of the}} propeller spinners on production aircraft. Repeated collapses during testing led to reinforcement of the nose landing gear.|$|E

50|$|Like {{many other}} liquid-fuel rocket engines, the XLR99s used {{regenerative}} cooling, {{in that the}} thrust chamber and nozzle had tubing surrounding it, through which the propellant and oxidizer passed before being burned. This kept the <b>engine</b> <b>cool,</b> and preheated the fuel. The basic engine weighs 910 lb, or 413 kg.|$|R
25|$|The tank {{equipped}} various British armoured {{divisions in}} the home defence and training roles. It never left the British Isles as poor <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> caused versions MkI-MkIII to be declared unfit for use overseas service especially in hot climates. This was rectified in the MkIV after many corrective actions were undertaken but by February 1944, it was declared obsolete. More than 1,700 of the type were built.|$|E
25|$|Another {{problem has}} become common since more Fieros are being {{serviced}} by auto repair shops {{not familiar with}} their design. The underbody coolant tubes are positioned in a manner in which not even a casual glance underneath the vehicle could determine their vulnerability. As a result, {{many of them have}} been crushed by shop lifts, resulting in a near complete lack of <b>engine</b> <b>cooling.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} annular {{radiators}} for <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> on the Ju 88, which placed these radiators immediately forward of each engine and directly behind each propeller, allowed the cooling lines for the engine coolant and oil-cooling radiators (integrated within the annular design) {{to be as}} short as possible, with integral port and starboard air intakes for cooling the exhaust headers, the starboard inlet also supplying the inlet air for the supercharger.|$|E
50|$|Keeping the {{air that}} enters the <b>engine</b> <b>cool</b> is an {{important}} part of the design of both superchargers and turbochargers. Compressing air increases its temperature, so it is common to use a small radiator called an intercooler between the pump and the engine to reduce the temperature of the air.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the {{bodywork}} includes three vents (visible in the photo above) {{on each side of}} the bike to cool the mechanicals: a pair of forward vents on the wheel cowling, a lower vent on each side for the transmission, and two larger vents to accommodate the <b>engine's</b> <b>cooling</b> system.|$|R
5000|$|Cooler {{to store}} {{perishables}} and beverages. If electricity is available, a thermoelectric or stirling <b>engine</b> <b>cooler</b> {{can be used}} {{without the need for}} ice. Campers at modern campgrounds will normally bring perishable foods in coolers while backcountry campers will bring non-perishable foods such as dried fruits, nuts, jerky, and MREs.|$|R
25|$|The P-47D-1 through P-47D-6, the P-47D-10, and the P-47D-11 {{successively}} incorporated {{changes such as}} {{the addition}} of more <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> flaps {{around the back of}} the cowl to reduce the engine overheating problems that had been seen in the field. Engines and engine subsystems saw refinement, (the P-47D-10 introduced the R-2800-63, replacing the R-2800-21 seen in previous P-47s) as did the fuel, oil and hydraulic systems. Additional armor protection was also added for the pilot.|$|E
25|$|The first Spitfire {{to be sent}} {{overseas}} in large numbers was the Mk Vc(trop). The majority of these were used by Allied squadrons in the Mediterranean theatre (including North Africa), Burma and in Australia with No. 1 Fighter Wing RAAF. The Vc initially suffered {{a high rate of}} mechanical failure in Australia, due to corrosion in <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> pipes that were unfilled and exposed to salt air, while being shipped from the UK.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{intercooler}} {{required a}} radiator, the radiator under the starboard wing was halved {{in size and}} the intercooler radiator housed alongside. Under the port wing a new radiator fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside the other half-radiator unit. When the engine was running at low speed, one radiator section provided enough coolant; a thermostatic switch turned off the starboard radiator section until more power was called for and extra <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> was required.|$|E

2500|$|In 1920, work {{commenced}} on two new fighter aircraft {{based on}} the VCP-1, featuring an easier to build fabric covered steel-tube fuselage instead of the plywood monocoque of the VCP-1.
