50|$|On its stroke from TDC to BDC, {{the punch}} enters the material, pushing {{it through the}} die, obtaining the shape {{determined}} by {{the design of the}} punch and die set. The piece of material (slug) cut from the workpiece is ejected through the <b>die</b> and <b>bolster</b> plate and collected in a scrap container. The return to TDC signals to the control to begin the next cycle.|$|R
50|$|Most punch presses are {{mechanically}} operated, {{but simple}} punches are often hand-powered. Major components of this mechanical press are the frame, motor, ram, <b>die</b> posts, <b>bolster,</b> and bed. The punch is mounted into the ram, and the die is mounted to the bolster plate. The scrap material drops through as the workpiece is advanced {{for the next}} hole. A large computer-controlled punch press is called a CNC turret punch. It houses punches and their corresponding dies in a revolving indexed turret. These machines use hydraulic as well as pneumatic power to press the shape with enough force to shear the metal.|$|R

Hydraulic try-out press is used for testing <b>dies.</b> Moving <b>bolster</b> is used for remove of testing die from the working area of the press. Roll-up cover is {{designed to protect the}} bottom cross beam against damage and dirt snapping. Part of this thesis is design a railway track, design of driving mechanism, strength calculation of all functional components, design of welded frame and mechanism of the roll-up cover including safety cover. Designed device is detail proposed in the 3 D software. The thesis contains drawing documentation assembly drawings movig bolster, mechanism of roll-up cover and welded frame consisting of welded and machined parts...|$|R
50|$|Kennedy {{requested}} {{her release}} from {{a contract with}} Sam Goldwyn. She {{decided to return to}} the stage in 1921, so that she could be close to her husband, broker Harold Bolster, in New York. <b>Bolster</b> <b>died</b> on August 3, 1927 from an illness he contracted months before during a business trip to South America. He {{was a member of the}} New York banking firm of Bennett, Bolster & Coghill. Bolster was 38 and a veteran of World War I. Kennedy inherited more than $500,000 when he died.|$|R
50|$|Praunheim's {{first big}} feature film was {{produced}} in 1970: <b>Die</b> Bettwurst (The <b>Bolsters),</b> a parody of bourgeois marriage. It became a cult movie, which had a sequel in 1973 (Berliner Bettwurst). In 1971 he also caused a stir with his documentary It Is Not the Homosexual Who Is Perverse, But the Society in Which He Lives which led to several gay rights groups being founded and {{was the beginning of}} the modern gay liberation movement in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. This movie affected gays in the USA, too.|$|R
50|$|Bolster {{was born}} in Saratoga Springs in 1913 and {{exhibited}} an early interest in photography. He graduated from St. Peter's Academy in Saratoga Springs and opened a photography studio. In 1958 {{he took over the}} business of another well-known Saratoga Springs photographer, Harry B. Settle. Settle's collection contained negatives by J. S. Wooley, Gustave Lorey, Seneca Ray Stoddard, C.C. Cook, and H.C. Ashby in addition to Settle's own work. To this Bolster added a large collection he acquired from another photographer, Joe Deuel, plus his own numerous photos of the Saratoga scene. <b>Bolster</b> <b>died</b> in 1989 and willed his collection to the Saratoga Springs History Museum.|$|R
5000|$|C type presses have a {{bed plate}} {{which is used}} to lock the <b>die</b> bottom <b>bolster.</b> For locking the die, T bolts are used and so this plate contain 'T - slots into which t- bolts are slid in. These slots are placed diagonally and with a slot {{horizontal}} to the longer side of the plate, is the general practice. These slots run up to a central hole made in the plate, the hole being large enough to accommodate another bush with a hole, the hole being used for dropping the punched part {{to the bottom of the}} press. The top of the tool butted against a vertical sliding ram with a clamping system which accommodates only a particular diameter of a threaded cylindrical member called the [...] "shank" [...] of the tool. The bottom portion of the tool is locked to the bottom bed plate and the top portion of the tool is locked to the sliding ram. Top and bottom portions of the tool are generally guided by suitable pillar and bush assemblies, which gives safety to the punching elements of the tool.|$|R
50|$|Henry B. Bolster, {{along with}} his son Henry Clay Bolster, and his son-in-law, Samuel Wakeman Andrews, started his Stage Coach {{business}} in 1846. In the 1850 census, the Bolsters are both listed as Stage Proprietors. It looks like Samuel didn't work for the business directly until the early 1850s (according to his obit and the 1850 census that lists his occupation as Dry Goods). Henry Clay <b>Bolster</b> <b>died</b> in 1854. The business was called Bolster & Andrews and {{referred to as the}} Empire Line. A short New York Times story about an accident with a Empire Line Omnibus in 1853.

50|$|He {{was born}} in Haddon to coach {{proprietor}} Richard Bolster and Ellen Ross. He attended state school and went to Western Australia in around 1900 with his brother to follow his father's trade. He returned to Victoria around 1902 and took over his mother's Ballarat grocery. On 7 June 1909 he married Eliza Jane Dimsey, {{with whom he had}} four sons. He expanded his business to include a number of stores around Ballarat, and also served on Ballarat City Council from 1925 to 1934, with a period as mayor from 1929 to 1930. In 1934 {{he was elected to the}} Victorian Legislative Council for Wellington Province, representing the United Australia Party. He switched to Ballarat Province in 1940 and retired in 1946. <b>Bolster</b> <b>died</b> at Ballarat East in 1948.|$|R
50|$|The {{bolster plate}} {{is mounted on}} top of the press bed and is a large block of metal upon which the bottom portion of a die is clamped; the bolster plate is stationary. Large presses (like the ones used in the {{automotive}} industry) may be equipped die cushions integrated in the bolster plate to apply blank holder or counter draw forces. This is necessary when a single acting press is used for deep drawing. The ram / slide is the moving or reciprocating member that the upper die is mounted to. Ram or Slide guidance is a critical element to assure long die life between die maintenance. Different types of slide guides are available, 4 point V-Gibs or 6 point square gibs on smaller presses and 8 point full length slide guides on larger straight side frame presses. With the dies and material be fed into the <b>die</b> between the <b>bolster</b> and slide, good press designs must account for plastic deformation, other wise known as defection when frame design and loads are considered.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In industry, on of {{the most}} {{important}} subjects is die and it's characteristics in which for cutting and forming different mechanical pieces, various punch and matrix metal die are used. whereas the common parts which form the main frame die are not often proportion with pieces and dies therefore using a part as socalled common part for frames in specified dimension ranges can decrease the time of designing, occupied space of warehouse and manufacturing costs. Parts in dies with getting uniform in their shape and dimension make common parts of dies. Common parts of punch and matrix metal <b>die</b> are as <b>bolster,</b> guide bush, guide pillar and shank. In this paper the common parts and effective parameters in selecting each of them as the primary information are studied, afterward for selection and design of mechanical parts an introduction and investigation based on the Mech. Desk. software is done hence with developing this software can standardize the metal common parts of punch and matrix. These studies will be so useful for designer in their designing and also using it has with very much advantage for manufactures of products in decreasing occupied spaces by dies.
