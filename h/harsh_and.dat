5|$|The call {{consists}} of weak staccato, chirping whistles, kleek kik ik ik ik, somewhat similar in cadence to a gull's call. The calls of young birds {{tend to be}} more <b>harsh</b> <b>and</b> shrill than those of adults.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{versatile}} hunting dog, used {{for its ability}} to locate and retrieve game in <b>harsh</b> <b>and</b> adverse terrain and conditions. It is not specialised to any one type of terrain, and tends to score well in field trials. The Blue Picardy {{is considered to be a}} quiet breed, but requires a great deal of exercise as it has a high level of stamina. It loves to play, and is a responsive and obedient breed which thrives on human companionship. It is especially good with children.|$|E
5|$|Many Sunnis (who {{compromise}} {{a substantial}} minority) support {{the government and}} see the Thirteen as dangerous revolutionaries that would destabilize the country should they succeed in toppling the monarchy. Government hardliners and Sunni political groups often call for <b>harsh</b> <b>and</b> no compromise approach, including calling for no pardons and death sentences. To their many supporters (in Bahrain and abroad) however, the Thirteen are heroes and prisoners of conscience jailed unfairly for nothing more than calling for democracy. Their faces appear daily in banners during protests.|$|E

5|$|Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) informs Sue (Jane Lynch) that swim coach Roz Washington (NeNe Leakes) is now Sue's cheerleading co-coach. Sue makes a {{deal with}} Figgins: if she helps New Directions win the Nationals show choir competition, she can regain sole control of the Cheerios. Sue offers Will (Matthew Morrison) her {{assistance}} and takes over dance rehearsals. She is a <b>harsh</b> <b>and</b> insulting taskmaster, which upsets the glee club.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many of its}} fellow mimids, {{the black}} catbird is not known to imitate any other species. Its song {{consists}} of repeated phrases of notes ranging from <b>harsh</b> <b>and</b> scratchy to warbled and flute-like, often interspersed with metallic clicking buzzes. It often sings from exposed perches. It {{has a variety of}} calls, including some which are quite {{similar to those of the}} gray catbird; these are variously described as a harsh rriah, a nasal chrrh and a grating tcheeu.|$|E
5|$|Another {{prominent}} {{opponent of}} the Theses was Johann Eck, Luther's friend and a theologian at the University of Ingolstadt. Eck wrote a refutation, intended for the Bishop of Eichstätt, entitled the Obelisks. This was {{in reference to the}} obelisks used to mark heretical passages in texts in the Middle Ages. It was a <b>harsh</b> <b>and</b> unexpected personal attack, charging Luther with heresy and stupidity. Luther responded privately with the Asterisks, titled after the asterisk marks then used to highlight important texts. Luther's response was angry and he expressed the opinion that Eck did not understand the matter on which he wrote. The dispute between Luther and Eck would become public in the 1519 Leipzig Debate.|$|E

5|$|As the {{landscape}} rises, trees become {{smaller and more}} sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite. These include lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, and mountain hemlock that, at highest elevations, give way to vast expanses of granite as treeline is reached. The climate in these habitats is <b>harsh</b> <b>and</b> the growing season is short, but species such as pika, yellow-bellied marmot, white-tailed jackrabbit, Clark's nutcracker, and black rosy finch are adapted to these conditions. Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.|$|E
5|$|Historian Sandra Mass {{considers}} the Rommel myth a hero cult, {{a synthesis of}} old and new hero cults and traditions culled primarily from Germany's largely imaginary colonial past, in particular the proletarian hero cult originally represented by Carl Peters and the bourgeois one represented by Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. Rommel, as portrayed by this hero cult, was both chivalrous and ruthless, young and old, <b>harsh</b> <b>and</b> gentle, strong and righteous. Calder, Duffy and Ricci opine that Rommel's military brilliance provoked a masochistic tendency to romanticise a worthy opponent, that because he was skilled at his profession, he must have been an anti-Nazi hero.|$|E
5|$|In late 1941, Wiesenthal and {{his wife}} were {{transferred}} to Janowska concentration camp and forced to work at the Eastern Railway Repair Works. He painted swastikas and other inscriptions on captured Soviet railway engines, and Cyla was put to work polishing the brass and nickel. In exchange for providing details about the railways, Wiesenthal obtained false identity papers for his wife from a member of the Armia Krajowa, a Polish underground organisation. She travelled to Warsaw, where she was put to work in a German radio factory. She spent time in two different labour camps as well. Conditions were <b>harsh</b> <b>and</b> her health was permanently damaged, but she survived the war. The couple was reunited in 1945, and their daughter Paulinka was born the following year.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{efforts at}} forcing the {{conversions}} of Spanish Muslims were started by Cardinal Cisneros, {{the archbishop of}} Toledo, who arrived in Granada {{in the autumn of}} 1499. In contrast to Granada's own archbishop Hernando de Talavera, who had friendly relations with the Muslim population and relied on a peaceful approach towards conversions, Cisneros adopted <b>harsh</b> <b>and</b> authoritarian measures. He sent uncooperative Muslims, especially noblemen, to prison where they were treated severely (including reports of torture) until they converted. Cisneros ignored warnings from his council that these methods might violate the Treaty of Granada, which guaranteed the Muslims freedom of religion. Instead, he intensified his efforts, and in December he wrote to Pope Alexander VI that he converted 3,000 Muslims in a single day.|$|E
5|$|Nigeria's {{human rights}} record remains poor; {{according}} to the US Department of State, the most significant human rights problems are: use of excessive force by security forces; impunity for abuses by security forces; arbitrary arrests; prolonged pretrial detention; judicial corruption and executive influence on the judiciary; rape, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners, detainees and suspects; <b>harsh</b> <b>and</b> life‑threatening prison and detention centre conditions; human trafficking {{for the purpose of}} prostitution and forced labour; societal violence and vigilante killings; child labour, child abuse and child sexual exploitation; domestic violence; discrimination based on ethnicity, region and religion.|$|E
5|$|Red wattlebirds are noisy animals, {{producing}} {{a range of}} raucous calls. Pairs of birds appear to duet, particularly at food sources, with the male {{producing a}} loud cackle and the female a whistling call. The male's cackle is loudest between 1and 3kHz frequency. A guttural-sounding call, it has been variously described as having a squawking, coughing or hiccuping sound. Males cackle when foraging by themselves, when with other birds, or when declaring their territory to other birds. The whistling call consists of up to five rapid whistles {{that may or may}} not ascend in tone and are repeated 3–4 times. Both sexes commonly utter a single chock note that may be <b>harsh</b> <b>and</b> guttural or have 4–5 harmonics. This is thought to be a contact call. These calls all carry over long distances.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} of the humiliation of Casey, {{the deaths of the}} topmen, and the severe punishment {{of the rest of the}} sailors appears to have driven the crew to mutiny. These factors, however, were arguably the final events in a series of <b>harsh</b> <b>and</b> brutal punishments by the captain. Dudley Pope, in his book The Black Ship, argues that it was not Pigot's cruelty that drove the men to mutiny but the general injustice that he showed in his favouritism to some and overly harsh punishment of others. Had Pigot remained more even-handed in his leadership, the mutiny might have been avoided.|$|E
5|$|The landed {{aristocracy}} of Spanish descent {{considered the}} illiterate, mixed-race gauchos, who comprised {{the majority of}} the population, to be ungovernable and untrustworthy. The gauchos were tolerated because there was no other labor force available, but were treated with contempt by the landowners. Rosas got along well with the gauchos in his service, despite his <b>harsh</b> <b>and</b> authoritarian comportment. He was known to dress like them, joke with them, take part in their horse-play, and pay them well, but he never allowed them to forget that he was their master rather than their equal. Shaped by the colonial society in which he lived, Rosas was conservative, an advocate of hierarchy and authority, like the other great landowners in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} {{is part of}} a popular hiking area, with the Appalachian Trail crossing the summit and one of the Appalachian Mountain Club's eight mountain huts, the Lakes of the Clouds Hut, located on one of the mountain's shoulders. Winter recreation includes Tuckerman Ravine, famous for its Memorial Day skiing and its 45-degree slopes. The ravine is notorious for its avalanches, of which about 100 are recorded every year, and which have killed six people since 1849. Scores of hikers have died on the mountain in all seasons, due to <b>harsh</b> <b>and</b> rapidly changing conditions, inadequate equipment, and failure to plan for the wide variety of conditions which can occur above tree line.|$|E

5|$|The steep {{walls of}} the gorge support some rare fauna and flora, {{including}} species unique to the gorge. There are a total of 24 rare plant species and two unique trees: the Bristol and Wilmotts's whitebeams. Other notable plants include Bristol rock cress, Bristol onion, spiked speedwell, autumn squill and honewort. Because of its steep sides, there are {{many parts of the}} gorge on which trees cannot grow, making way for smaller plants. The gorge is also home to rare invertebrate species. The gorge has a microclimate around 1 degree warmer than the surrounding land. The steep south-west facing sides receive the afternoon sunlight, but are partially sheltered from the prevailing winds. When winds come from the Bristol Channel in the north west they may be funnelled into the gorge, creating <b>harsh</b> <b>and</b> wet conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} {{in the spring of}} 1194 in the English county of Nottinghamshire. Lady Marian FitzWalter attends a festival held at Huntington Castle by the Earl of Huntington, who wishes to honour the return of his only {{surviving}} heir, Lord Robert of Locksley, from the Crusades. Marian seeks an audience with Robert to learn the manner of her father, Sir Hugh's, death the previous year, as Robert was a witness. The reserved, mentally scarred Robert reacts strongly, having flashbacks to Sir Hugh's violent murder at the hands of Saracens. He informs her that Hugh wished for Marian to marry William DeLacey, the <b>harsh</b> <b>and</b> scheming Sheriff of Nottingham, to her dismay. DeLacey knows naught of this, but intends to make her marry him anyway.|$|E
5|$|The {{winter of}} 1946–47 was <b>harsh,</b> <b>and</b> in February the sub-zero {{temperatures}} burst the water main outside Ketèlbey's Hampstead home. With his house partially flooded, he {{lost most of}} his correspondence, manuscripts and papers {{and he and his}} wife both contracted pneumonia. The couple were taken to the Regent's Park Nursing Home, where Lottie died two days later. He sold his house and moved temporarily to the Hendon Hall Hotel, where he had a nervous breakdown. He spent the remainder of the year staying in hotels in southern England; in Bournemouth he began a relationship with Mabel Maud Pritchett, a hotel manageress, and the couple married in October in the following year.|$|E
