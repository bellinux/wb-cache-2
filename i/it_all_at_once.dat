500|$|With {{a modest}} income secured, Holst {{was able to}} marry Isobel; the {{ceremony}} was at Fulham Register Office on 22 June 1901. Their marriage lasted until his death; there was one child, Imogen, born in 1907. In 1902 Dan Godfrey and the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra premiered Holst's symphony The Cotswolds (Op. 8), the slow movement {{of which is a}} lament for William Morris who had died in October 1896, three years before Holst began work on the piece. In 1903 Adolph von Holst died, leaving a small legacy. Holst and his wife decided, as Imogen later put it, that [...] "as they were always hard up the only thing to do was to spend <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> on a holiday in Germany".|$|E

60|$|Julius {{delivered}} {{himself of}} this tremendous lie with a transparently earnest countenance. Yet Dan, credulous as he was, {{could not believe}} <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then I {{waited for}} the storm to burst. <b>It</b> didn't <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> The shock was too great, and at first quite paralyzed my half-sister.|$|R
6000|$|... "This one thing, Ethel, I must stipulate. Don't you go {{and tell}} <b>it</b> <b>all</b> out <b>at</b> <b>once</b> to him. I cannot have him worried about our concerns." ...|$|R
60|$|Mike {{could not}} take <b>it</b> in <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> He was stunned. All he could {{understand}} was that a far worse thing had happened than anything he could have imagined.|$|R
60|$|At {{the gate}} <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> {{occurred}} to her to ask whether she should tell Mrs. Churton about meeting Mr. Chance in the wood or not.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know. But I can't work {{round to}} <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> I shan't misjudge her, but you can't {{expect me to}} get over it right away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{quite so}} stiff, Benjy, {{not quite so}} stiff. Be more gentle next time. Don't do <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once,</b> boy; jerk it, Benjy, a turn or so at a time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{something}} in that, Fergus, though I own that I had not thought of it. Well, perhaps {{it is better to}} take it in small doses than have <b>it</b> come <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Mr Pecksniff opened {{another door}} on the same floor, and shut <b>it</b> again, <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once,</b> as if <b>it</b> were a Blue Chamber. But before he had well done so, he looked smilingly round, and said, 'Why not?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank'ee, old fellow, I'm {{sure you}} do. Come, Wilkinson, {{give us your}} hand. It's better to have <b>it</b> <b>all</b> out <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> I wish you'd had more luck, and there's an end of <b>it.</b> <b>It's</b> <b>all</b> luck, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|Frank's {{face grew}} rather red. [...] "You couldn't {{expect me to}} drop into <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> Give me {{a week or two}} to pick up the swing and balance of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes;--and {{what sort}} of a time do their wives have? Oh, Mary, my own, my own, my own!--it is very bad! You cannot {{understand}} <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once,</b> {{but it is very}} bad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But we don't {{have to get}} <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once,</b> Aunt Matilda," [...] said Harry, laughing; [...] "and you needn't {{be afraid}} that we can't do it. Come, Kate, it's {{time for us to}} be off." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Britling {{presently}} went on {{with the}} talk. [...] "For me <b>it</b> came <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once,</b> without a doubt or a hope. I hoped until the last that nothing would touch Hugh. And then {{it was like a}} black shutter falling--in an instant...." ...|$|R
6000|$|Percy [...] . Percy [...] . {{her husband}} [...] . the Scarlet Pimpernel [...] . Oh! {{how could she}} have been so blind? She {{understood}} <b>it</b> <b>all</b> now--all <b>at</b> <b>once</b> [...] . that part he played--the mask he wore [...] . in order to throw dust in everybody's eyes.|$|R
25|$|Free {{software}} projects, although {{developed through}} collaboration, are often produced independently of each other. The {{fact that the}} software licenses explicitly permit redistribution, however, provides a basis for larger scale projects that collect the software produced by stand-alone projects and make <b>it</b> available <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> {{in the form of}} a Linux distribution.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suffer no one {{to insult}} my child in her own house," [...] said the alderman, so much {{provoked}} as to be determined {{to put an end}} to <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> [...] "Stephen Birkenholt, come here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Give me time," [...] {{he pleaded}} piteously. [...] "I can't {{bring myself to}} <b>it,</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> I mean well. Upon my soul, I mean well. But I am slow at this sort of thing. Wait till to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Suppose I {{should give}} you the Latin grammar to learn in three months, and tell you that, {{at the end of}} that time, I would hear you recite <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> Do you suppose you should be ready?” ...|$|E
6000|$|How paltry <b>it</b> seemed <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once!</b> What did <b>it</b> {{matter if}} France was ruled by that vapid King or by that brainless, overdressed woman beside him? What {{did it matter}} if that young man with the shifty blue eyes and the fair, curly hair succeeded in ousting another man from the English throne? ...|$|R
5000|$|Basically {{the same}} as the {{previous}} season, there are several changes. First, there is the new command of [...] "air," [...] which means the players must raise the indicated body part up off the ground. Second, the dots no longer disappear one at a time but instead the entire border row flashes before <b>it</b> disappears <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Dr. Monygham blurted <b>it</b> <b>all</b> out <b>at</b> <b>once,</b> in the rough. For {{some time}} after he had done, the Administrador of the San Tome mine {{remained}} looking at him without a word. Mrs. Gould sank into a low chair with her hands lying on her lap. A silence reigned between those three motionless persons. Then Charles Gould spoke-- ...|$|R
60|$|They were {{standing}} at the door, and she was looking toward the hill, perhaps without seeing <b>it.</b> <b>All</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> it came to Gavin that this fragile girl might have a history far sadder and more turbulent than his.|$|E
60|$|I had {{no sooner}} spoken than I heartily wished that I had held my peace; for <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> {{occurred}} to me that green was perhaps the color for an alien or mere hireling, in which light they perhaps regarded me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am struggling, and I shall succeed; but I cannot do <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> At {{any rate}} I {{could not go}} there. You must give my love to Lady Julia, and not let her think me cross. Perhaps Bell will go." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The text exceeds {{our ability}} to keep {{everything}} in our heads, to take <b>it</b> <b>all</b> in <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> There is too much going on among too many characters in too many places. ... This tone shifts in which Pynchon spoofs various styles of popular literature was all surely part of the intention, a simulation of the disorienting overload of modern culture." ...|$|R
6000|$|In the {{absorbing}} {{interest of}} the moment, I poured out those words one after another {{as fast as they}} would pass my lips. Miserrimus Dexter completely falsified the lawyer's prediction. He shuddered under the shock. His eyes opened wide with amazement. [...] "Say it again!" [...] he cried. [...] "I can't take <b>it</b> <b>all</b> in <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> You stun me." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>all</b> seemed different, <b>at</b> <b>once</b> {{more real}} {{and not so}} jumbled together, now that she used her own eyes instead of the {{guidance}} of that knowing old city bird, Mr. Albert Sessions.|$|R
6000|$|... [Picture: Lady pinning up frock] They pull on pretty {{steadily}} for a bit, after this, {{and then}} <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> occurs {{to one of}} them that she will pin up her frock, and they ease up for the purpose, and the boat runs aground.|$|E
60|$|With {{that she}} discover'd <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once,</b> for she turn'd Fury, {{in the very}} Letter of it; flew out in a Passion, rail'd at me, curst me most heartily, and {{immediately}} disappeared; which you know is the particular Mark of a Spirit or Apparition.|$|E
6000|$|... "A sudden thought struck him. Pulling off his coat, {{he seized}} a mallet and a caulking-chisel, {{and began to}} belabour {{the side of a}} boat as if his life {{depended}} on <b>it.</b> <b>All</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> he stopped and stood up, blowing with the exertion.|$|E
60|$|Somerset still {{remained}} {{where he had}} placed himself, mentally balancing science against art, the grandeur of this fine piece of construction against that of the castle, and thinking whether Paula's father had not, after all, the best of <b>it,</b> when <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> he saw Paula's form confronting him {{at the entrance of}} the tunnel. He instantly went forward into the light; to his surprise she was as pale as a lily.|$|R
60|$|Monty {{removed his}} sombrero--something {{he had never}} done before--and the single instant when it was off was long enough to show his head entirely bald. This {{was one of the}} hall-marks of that terrible Montana prairie fire through which he had fought {{to save the life of}} a child. Madeline did not forget <b>it,</b> and <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> she wanted to take Monty's side. Remembering Stillwell's wisdom, however, she forebore {{yielding}} to sentiment, and called upon her wits.|$|R
60|$|A slight swishing rustle {{showed that}} Nostromo was setting the sail. <b>It</b> filled <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> {{with a sound}} as of a single loud drum-tap. Decoud {{went back to the}} ravine. Nostromo, at the tiller, looked back from time to time at the {{vanishing}} mass of the Great Isabel, which, little by little, merged into the uniform texture of the night. At last, when he turned his head again, he saw nothing but a smooth darkness, like a solid wall.|$|R
