40|$|In {{addition}} to vertical time shifts commonly observed in time-lapse seismic images, horizontal <b>displacements</b> are apparent as well. These apparent horizontal <b>displacements</b> may be small relatively to seismic wavelengths, perhaps only 5 m at depths of 5 km, but they consistently suggest an outward lateral expansion of images {{away from a}} compacting reservoir. It {{is well known that}} apparent vertical <b>displacements</b> are caused mostly by a decrease in seismic wave velocities above compacting reservoirs. Those same velocity changes contribute to horizontal <b>displacements.</b> This contribution can be computed from the velocity changes that, in turn, can be estimated from measured vertical <b>displacements.</b> Horizontal <b>displacements</b> computed in this way are similar to those measured, and this similarity suggests that horizontal as well as vertical <b>displacements</b> may be largely due to velocity changes. Key words: time-lapse seismic imaging...|$|R

40|$|New {{baseline}} correction {{method of}} strong-motion records using pulses {{was developed by}} Minowa. This method is possible to provide static <b>displacements</b> from strong-motion records. Corrected acceleration is obtained by subtracting acceleration pulses from original accelerations. These pulses are obtained from the shape of velocities and <b>displacements</b> including errors. Corrected velocities and <b>displacements</b> are calculated from corrected accelerations. Corrected <b>displacements</b> by this method can provide static <b>displacements.</b> This new method was applied for strong-motion accelerations observed in Hokkaido Japan during Magnitude 8. 0 Tokachi-oki Earthquake Sep. 26, 2003. Static <b>displacements</b> from these case studies were compared with the static movement observed {{before and after the}} earthquake using Global Positioning System by Geographical Survey Institute in Japan.

40|$|Abstract. We {{measured}} integrated intensities of 26 {{reflections of}} the B 2 -phase of titanium nickelide single crystal and determined structure factors for these reflections. Based on the structure factors, mean squares of <b>displacements</b> of Ni and Ti atoms {{with respect to the}} crystal-lattice sites have been determined. After that we determined the mean squares of atomic <b>displacements</b> Ni and Ti in temperature range of existence of the B 2 -pase, at temperatures Ð¢ 1 = 328 K and T 2 = 376 K. We separated the mean squares of atomic <b>displacements</b> Ni and Ti into static and dynamic ones. The mean squares of dynamic <b>displacements</b> of Ni and Ti atoms are identical, but the mean square of static <b>displacements</b> is greater by a factor of 4. 7 for Ni atoms than for Ti atoms. The Debye temperature calculated from the mean squares of <b>displacements</b> of Ni atoms is 360 K; that calculated for Ti atoms in a similar way is 390 K. The large value of complete atomic <b>displacements</b> in TiNi is due to static rather than dynamic <b>displacements</b> of atoms, mainly due to static <b>displacements</b> of nickel atoms...|$|R

He suggested that if the torpedo bulkhead needed to be strengthened, the ship might be too heavy for the 28cm(11in) guns, if the <b>displacement</b> of around 19,000t(21,000short tons) was to be retained. Tirpitz refused to consider using smaller guns, even if it meant increasing the <b>displacement</b> of the ship. Von Eickstedt proposed employing a secondary battery of 17cm(6.7in) guns instead of the 15cm(5.9in) the design called for, but the increased weight would have made it impossible to mount eight main battery guns.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this research, we are {{interested}} in predicting the dynamical response of complex structures characterized by the presence of numerous local elastic modes that appear immediatly in the low-frequency range. Where the modal analysis method would classically provide a small-dimension basis constituted of global <b>displacements</b> {{for the construction of a}} robust and accurate reduced-order model adapted to the case of a low modal density, it is not the case considered here. Unlike global <b>displacements,</b> the local <b>displacements</b> are very sensitive to both parameters uncertainties and model uncertainties induced by modeling errors. This paper presents an original methodology which allows us to separate the admissible <b>displacements</b> space into the two algebraically independent subspaces of global and local <b>displacements.</b> This global/local separation allows a separated nonparametric probabilistic model of uncertainties to be implemented and thus allows the variabilities of the global <b>displacements</b> and of the local <b>displacements</b> to be controlled separately...|$|R

An astern turbine was incorporated in the exhaust casing of the low-pressure turbine, and a cruising turbine was coupled directly to the high-pressure turbine. A speed of 28.5 knots was expected at standard <b>displacement</b> and 27.5 knots at full-load <b>displacement</b> on normal output; corresponding speeds at overload condition were 29.25 and 28.25 knots respectively.

The three models provide inconsistent predictions of observed lateral ground <b>displacements,</b> with one method overpredicting and two methods both overpredicting and underpredicting observed lateral ground <b>displacements</b> by large amounts.

25|$|An {{acoustic}} horn converts large pressure variations {{with a small}} <b>displacement</b> area into a low pressure variation with a large <b>displacement</b> area and vice versa. It does this through the gradual, often exponential increase of the cross sectional area of the horn. The small cross-sectional area of the throat restricts the passage of air thus presenting a high acoustic impedance to the driver. This allows the driver to develop a high pressure for a given <b>displacement.</b> Therefore the sound waves at the throat are of high pressure and low <b>displacement.</b> The tapered shape of the horn allows the sound waves to gradually decompress and increase in <b>displacement</b> until they reach the mouth where they are of a low pressure but large <b>displacement.</b>|$|E
