Finally, the <b>impressed</b> <b>currents</b> are related to electrical activity at the membranes of active cells.

The solutions correctly reproduce the conclusions of a previous work in which the relevance of Yukawa like potentials determined by diffusion effects were identified. Within the approximate solutions, the effective potential generated by the impressed sources is given by the superposition of Yukawa potentials created by the impressed charges concentrated in a given volume element.

40|$|Abstract. Bayesian {{modeling}} {{and analysis of}} the MEG and EEG modalities provide a flexible framework for introducing prior information complementary to the measured data. This prior information is often qualitative in nature, making the translation of the available information into a computational model a challenging task. We propose a generalized gamma family of hyperpriors which allows the <b>impressed</b> <b>currents</b> to be focal and we advocate a fast and efficient iterative algorithm, the Iterative Alternating Sequential (IAS) algorithm for computing maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates. Furthermore, we show that for particular choices of the scalar parameters specifying the hyperprior, the algorithm effectively approximates popular regularization strategies such as the Minimum Current Estimate and the Minimum Support Estimate. The connection between priorconditioning and adaptive regularization methods is also pointed out. The posterior densities are explored by means of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) strategy suitable for this family of hypermodels. The computed experiments suggest that the known preference of regularization methods for superficial sources over deep sources is a property of the MAP estimators only, and that estimation of the posterior mean in the hierarchical model is better adapted for localizing deep sources. 1...|$|R

The electrochemical corrosion process was periodically monitored with GPR. Two control specimens were also prepared to investigate the influence of chloride contamination on GPR signal. The measured data were analysed both in time and frequency domains.

In frequency domain, the time-frequency representations of the signal were computed by using S-transform. The results show that reinforce corrosion increased the amplitude of reflected signal in time domain but did not change the peak frequency in frequency domain while chloride contamination attenuates the signal to smaller amplitude and lower peak frequency.
