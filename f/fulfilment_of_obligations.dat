60|$|The tide of {{industrial}} progress is often irregular. There are pauses of varying length, and sometimes recoils, when reckless traders find their ventures stranded and {{in danger of}} being wrecked before the next impulse of the flood can float them on. They borrow and buy too freely; trafficking produce not yet grown; building stores and offices in excess of the country's needs. A time comes when this is apparent, speculation ceases, credit fails, and the new cities must wait until expanding agriculture overtakes them. In the meanwhile, the <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> is demanded and, as often happens, cannot be made.|$|E

It is a weak view of moral obligations, that confines them merely to the accidents of birth, and birth-place. Such a subsequent state of things may have grown up, as to change all our duties, and {{it is necessary that}} we discharge them as they are; not as they may have been, hitherto, or may be, hereafter.

6000|$|I {{may as well}} in a few {{sentences}} finally {{close the}} Ionian chapter, though the consummation was not immediate. Mr. Gladstone, while he was for the moment bitten by the notion of ceding the southern islands to Greece, was no more touched by the nationalist aspirations of the Ionians {{than he had been}} by nationalism and unification in Italy in 1851. Just as in Italy he clung to constitutional reforms in the particular provinces and states as the key to regeneration, so here he leaned upon the moderates who, while professing strong nationalist feeling, did not believe that the time for its realisation had arrived. A debate was raised in the House of Commons in the spring of 1861, by an Irish member. The Irish catholics twitted Mr. Gladstone with flying the flag of nationality in Italy, and trampling on it in the Ionian islands. He in reply twitted them with crying up nationality for the Greeks, and running it down when it told against the pope. In the Italian case Lord John Russell had (1860) set up the broad doctrine that a people are the only true judges who should be their rulers--a proposition that was at once seized and much used by the Dandolos, Lombardos, Cavalieratos and the rest at Corfu. Scarcely anybody pretended that England had any separate or selfish interest of her own. 'It is in my view,' said Mr. Gladstone, 'entirely a matter of that kind of interest only, which, is in one sense the highest interest of all--namely the interest which is inherent in her character and duty, and her exact and regular <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> which she has contracted with Europe.'[382] ...|$|E

40|$|This article explores {{reciprocity}} {{within the}} exchange {{relationship between the}} employee and employer using the psychological contract framework. Specifically, we examine the bi-directionality of the norm of reciprocity. We hypothesize {{that there will be}} a positive relationship between perceived employer obligations, <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> and employee obligations and fulfilment. In addition, we hypothesize that employee <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> will be positively associated with perceived employer obligations. Using a longitudinal survey of 1400 public sector employees and 84 managers, our findings suggest that there is broad agreement between the two parties regarding the norm of reciprocity that governs the relationship. We found that perceived employer obligations at time 1 is positively associated with employees’ <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> at time 2 and perceived employer <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> at time 1 is positively related to employee obligations and <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> at time 2. Furthermore, we found that employee <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> at time 1 is positively associated with perceived employer obligations at time 2. Overall, these findings provide initial empirical support for the norm of reciprocity in exchange relationships from both the perspective of employees as well as managers, as employer representatives...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Security policy {{specification}} can {{be difficult}} to get right. Electronic systems often fail to provide an easy route to encode requirements that would be simple to en-force through controlling how physical principals interact. This paper presents a means to ameliorate potential policy mismatches through the use of location awareness systems allowing changes in the physical world to be mapped to electronic policy state. These changes are represented formally using the event calculus. Patterns over this state are used to track compliance with policy and to detect the <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations.</b> A number of example scenarios are provided to illustrate the utility of the coupling between spatial and policy concerns, and to demonstrate the notation used.

40|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that, for many reasons, producing a son has always been of utmost importance for an Indian couple. For the husband, a male child meant not only the possibility to ensure the continuation of his patrilineage, but also the <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> to the ancestors. A woman truly entered her affinal home only {{with the birth of}} a child, and giving birth to a son made her incorporation into the husband’s family worthy of appreciation. Everyday life in its all manifestations, along with all its sorrows and joys, is reflected in human literary creativity. No wonder, therefore, that {{the question of how to}} get a son has become the nucleus of many Sanskrit narratives as well as of folk tales in different vernaculars. One could also take into consideration the fact that all these tales about impregnating food, so popular among tribal people in different parts of the world, are based on a close observation of nature, and certain substances introduced into the diet can really stimulate procreativity...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this bachelor thesis on theme Organic food production from animal husbandry in the Czech Republic is a brief characterization of differences between organic agriculture and conventional agriculture as well as definition of basic concepts regarding the theme. The thesis briefly defines a principle of certification, BIO mark control and <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> which are related to BIO mark use. Subsequent part describes a way of breeding animals in organic agriculture and how the products are processed. This part is concerned about breeding of cattle, pigs and poultry.

40|$|Invasive {{alien species}} {{are one of}} the main drivers of {{biodiversity}} loss, due to their ability to disperse and cause negative effects on native species and the environment. To reduce the introduction of invasive alien species in the future, preventive measures need to be implemented, and knowledge about pathways of introduction of new and potentially invasive alien species can facilitate tailor-made measures. The aim of this project is to contribute to the <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> in the CBD Aichi target 9 and the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2020 target 5, by identifying and prioritising the most significant pathways of introduction for invasive alien species by conducting a pathway analysis and horizon scanning.

40|$|Purpose This study aims {{to examine}} {{reciprocal}} exchange in teams using a psychological contract (PC) framework. Adopting Rousseau’s conceptualization of the contract, the authors explore {{the extent to which}} the team members reciprocate perceived team obligations and fulfilment by adjusting their own obligations and fulfilment. A new scale for the measurement of obligations and fulfilment was developed. Team commitment was hypothesized as a mediating variable. Design/methodology/approach The new PC scale was tested in a longitudinal study design. A survey of a representative sample of 230 Dutch first-year college students nested in 73 teams was conducted. Findings The authors found that in student teams, perceived team obligations at Time 1 are positively associated with perceived member obligations at Time 2. Furthermore, they found higher commitment to the team as the team fulfilled the obligations as perceived by its members. Contrary to the exchange theory, in student teams, perceived <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> at Time 1 is not reciprocated by more obligations of its members at Time 2. No significant mediating effects are found of team commitment. Originality/value To date, this study provides the first measurement of contract fulfilment in non-hierarchical team relationships. The instrument can act as a tool to assess future team effectiveness and performance and adjust team composition accordingly...|$|E

The purpuse of the thesis is to analyse current regulation and conclusions of judicial practise. The thesis is composed of seven chapters. Chapter One is rather general and characterises the nature and purpose of discharge. Chapter Two focuses on foreign sources of inspiration for our legislation. Its three parts report on regulation similar to our discharge in the USA, Germany and Slovakia. Chapter Three is subdivided into five parts and provides information about discharge conditions, namely the state of insolvency or the imminent insolvency, a subjective admissibility of discharge (which further discusses {{the evolution of the}} interpretation of this issue), the requirement of minimum dividend to unsecured creditors, honest intent and responsible approach of the debtor towards <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> in the insolvency proceedings. Chapter Four concentrates on discharge from a procedural point of view. Firs it deals with a insolvency petition of the debtor and with a petition for the discharge permit.
