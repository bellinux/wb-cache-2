5|$|Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, {{is widely}} celebrated with festive family meals and {{symbolic}} foods. Sweetness {{is the main}} theme and the Rosh Hashana dinners typically begin with apples dipped in honey, and end with honey cake. The challah is usually round, often studded with raisins and <b>drizzled</b> <b>with</b> honey, and other symbolic fruits and vegetables are eaten as an entree, such as pomegranates, carrots, leeks and beets. Fish dishes, symbolizing abundance, are served; for example, gefilte fish is traditional for Ashkenazim, while Moroccan Jews prepare the spicy fish dish, chraime. Honey cake (lekach) is often served as dessert, accompanied by tea or coffee.|$|E
25|$|Despite its humble ubiquity {{among the}} poor, {{it is also}} popular as a main entrée when cooked {{with a variety of}} meats. For example, cháo gà is cooked with chicken, garlic, and ginger.

Other combinations include cháo vịt (duck porridge), which is cooked in the same fashion as the chicken porridge, but with duck. Cháo lòng heo is made with lòng heo, a variety of offal from pork or duck with sliced portions of congealed pork blood. Cháo is typically served with quẩy on the side.|$|E

500|$|By the 16thcentury, {{centralized}} kingdoms {{had emerged}} {{on the west}} coast among the Sakalava and in the Central highlands among the Merina. The Merina sovereigns celebrated the new year with an ancient Merina ceremony called the Royal Bath (fandroana). For this ceremony, a beef confit called jaka (...) was prepared by placing beef in a decorative clay jar and sealing it with suet, then conserving it in an underground pit for a year. The jaka would be shared with friends at the following year's festival. As a dessert, revelers would eat rice boiled in milk and <b>drizzled</b> <b>with</b> honey, a preparation known as tatao (...) [...] According to oral history, King Ralambo was the originator of these culinary traditions in Imerina.

40|$|This article retraces {{the early}} stages of {{development}} of the 'peer-to-peer cloud' storage service <b>Drizzle,</b> <b>with</b> the aim of providing an example of decentralised network architecture as internet governance 'in practice'. More specifically, this paper sheds light on how changes in the architectural design of networked services affect the circulation, storage and privacy of data, as well as the rights and responsibilities exerted by different actors on them. This article does not mean to be a compendium of the implications of the decentralisation option in building a cloud platform, which entails a number of technical complications as well as advantages, including how to ensure the reliability and redundancy of data, and the soundness of the encryption mechanism. However, the privacy-related design choices described {{here are some of the}} many possible ways to illustrate the extent to which changes in network architecture are, indeed, changes in network governance...|$|R
