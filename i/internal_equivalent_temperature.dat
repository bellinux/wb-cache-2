40|$|Today, battery {{electric}} vehicles {{as well as}} stationary battery system demand lithium-ion batteries. Lithium titanate battery cells with their excellent charge and discharge rate capabilities in combination with their long lifetime have become an attractive option {{for these kinds of}} applications. However, to ensure safe operation of lithium batteries - especially in high power applications - temperature observation is mandatory. So, it is highly important to have a reliable thermal management system with proper temperature estimation. Normally, an external temperature sensor is placed {{on the surface of the}} battery case. This method is not very appropriate because only the external battery temperature can be detected, which is delayed by the thermal coupling between sensor and cell, and thermal capacity of the battery cell. This paper describes the development of a circuit that performs sensorless temperature estimation of a lithium-ion battery cell. A functional prototype was developed and comprehensive tests are performed to verify the functionality of this prototype. It is demonstrated that it is possible to determine the <b>internal</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature</b> of the cell using the measurement results of the developed circuit. Further, the circuit concept can be easily integrated into the monitoring system of high power battery systems. As a result, the developed prototype may enhance the safety of battery systems by proper temperature estimation of lithium-ion batteries used in {{electric vehicles}} and stationary energy storage systems...|$|E
40|$|<b>Equivalent</b> <b>temperature</b> is an {{atmospheric}} {{variable that}} combines both dry static energy (associated with temperature) and moist static energy (associated with moisture). Changes in <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature</b> therefore reflect changes in total surface energy content. This research {{is concerned with}} quantifying trends in <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature</b> and its subcomponents at 8 National Weather Service (NWS) 1 st Order stations in the central USA. Data quality control was conducted and time series and time-varying percentile trends of maximum and minimum <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature</b> and its subcomponents were developed {{for each of the}} stations on the daily scale; along with a heat wave trend analysis. It was found that there is an overall positive trend in lower tropospheric heat content over the last 60 years [...] driven primarily by increases in low-level moisture. The largest changes in <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature</b> occurred during spring and fall, with some of these trends as large as 5 deg. Celsius/ 50 years. Furthermore, it was found that there is {{an increase in the number}} of high humidity heat wave events and that these types of events are more frequent than low humidity events; which saw a slight decrease in frequency. Interestingly, one station (Nashville, TN) exhibited a slight negative trend in <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature</b> maxima, which may be due to synoptic-scale influence such as the Great Plains low-level jet. The results demonstrate that <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature</b> provides a different perspective than temperature for assessing regional climate change...|$|R

50|$|In the 1960s, {{wind chill}} {{began to be}} {{reported}} as a wind chill <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature</b> (WCET), which is theoretically less useful. The author of this change is unknown, {{but it was not}} Siple or Passel as is generally believed. At first, it was defined as the temperature at which the windchill index would be the same in the complete absence of wind. This led to <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperatures</b> that exaggerated the severity of the weather. Charles Eagan realized that people are rarely still and that even when it was calm, there was some air movement. He redefined the absence of wind to be an air speed of 1.8 m/s, which was about as low a wind speed as a cup anemometer could measure. This led to more realistic (warmer-sounding) values of <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|R

Several machine learning methods were investigated with the purpose of estimating cabin occupant <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature</b> from sensors throughout the cabin, namely Multiple Linear Regression, MultiLayer Perceptron, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, Radial Basis Function Network, REPTree, K-Nearest Neighbour and Random Forest.

A total of 30 experimental hours were used for training and evaluating the estimators' performance.

40|$|There is {{substantial}} evidence that both temperature {{and air pollution}} are predictors of mortality. Thus far, few {{studies have focused on}} the potential interactive effects between the thermal environment and different measures of air pollution. Such interactions, however, are biologically plausible, as (extreme) temperature or increased air pollution might make individuals more susceptible to the effects of each respective predictor. This study investigated the interactive effects between <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature</b> and air pollution (ozone and particulate matter) in Berlin (Germany) and Lisbon (Portugal) using different types of Poisson regression models. The findings suggest that interactive effects exist between air pollutants and <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature.</b> Bivariate response surface models and generalised additive models (GAMs) including interaction terms showed an increased risk of mortality during periods of elevated <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperatures</b> and air pollution.

30|$|For comparison, the OH <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature,</b> {{which is}} the {{atmospheric}} temperature weighted by the vertical profile of OH volume emission rate obtained by the SABER observations, is plotted in Fig. 3 (diamonds). Each value of OH <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature</b> is given as a mean of typically three or four tangential points within a 500 -km distance of Syowa Station. Since SABER passes closely over Syowa Station twice a day in its ascending and descending orbit, the universal time (UT) of these data points is also derived by averaging. The typical sampling times above Syowa Station in this period are 13 – 14 UT and 22 – 23 UT for ascending and descending orbits, respectively. The mean distance of these data points from Syowa Station is about 200 km. The numbers located near the diamond symbols specify the number of SABER profiles {{used to calculate the}} daily average value and UT. The process used to derive OH <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature</b> and the altitude profiles of atmospheric temperature and OH volume emission rates is as follows. First, the averaged profiles of temperature and OH volume emission rates are calculated by an equal weighting of three to four soundings. Then, two profiles of OH volume emission rate of two SABER channels are normalized with integrated emission rates through the OH layer. The two SABER OH VER channels are at 1.6 µm, which mostly includes the OH (4 - 2) and OH (5 - 3) bands, and 2.0 µm, which mostly includes the OH (8 - 6) and OH (9 - 7) bands. These two altitude profiles are combined and averaged to obtain the weighting function. Finally, these weighting functions are combined with the altitude profiles of temperature to obtain OH <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Good agreement between the OH rotational and <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperatures</b> is seen except on DOY 128. A possible reason for this difference is the effect of unknown local heating or a horizontal inhomogeneity of temperature because the field of view of SABER is not necessarily {{the same as that of}} the ground-based observation.|$|R

Based on detailed discussions on calculating and measuring the <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature,</b> predicted mean vote (PMV) and standard effective temperature (SET*), a comfort sensor with a new structure is proposed in this paper. The proposed PMV and SET* measurement instrument consists of an <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature</b> sensor, a relative humidity sensor and a temperature sensor. By utilizing this sensor we can "measure" the PMV and SET* of an imaginary environment, which is extended from that defined in the concept of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature</b> by Madsen (ASHRAE Transactions 1984; 90 (1) : 1077 - 90). Furthermore, we show that the PMV and SET* of the imaginary environment are almost the same as the actual ones. Simulation results have verified that the suggested PMV and SET* sensor can have a good measurement of PMV, while for SET* more research work is needed to improve the accuracy of its measurement. Most importantly, more practical work, including calibration validation and test of its sensitivity to the variation of environment variables in real conditions, need to be performed. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
