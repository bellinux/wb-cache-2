50|$|In his tackle box are plugs, lures, wigglers, flies, {{and live}} bait who was Jerry, sleeping. Tom wakes up Jerry, and the annoyed mouse {{takes off his}} robe {{with a look of}} disgust on his face. Tom then ties Jerry to his line and casts. Jerry is about to hit the water when he {{suddenly}} stops and dips his toe in the water to test the temperature. The water is ice cold, and Jerry races back to the tackle box with his blanket, shivering. A bunch of fish start making noise and Tom lowers Jerry over the water to feed them. The fish leap at him and Jerry fights them off, kicking and punching. Having failed, Tom casts again and a big blue and <b>green</b> <b>pike</b> with pointy teeth emerges. Jerry is cast into, and propelled out of, the fish's mouth. The pike chases Jerry, chomping all of Tom’s fishing pole in the process. The fish swats Tom with his tail and returns to the water, where he spits out Tom’s reel and throws it at Tom.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the name}} [...] "Old Harford" [...] may be traced with {{certainty}} to {{only the first}} third of the nineteenth century, the right-of-way itself is older. For example, the 1794 map of Maryland by Dennis Griffith (shown below) depicts a thoroughfare extending northeast from {{the central part of}} Baltimore City into Harford County, Maryland. This road is distinct from nearby roads that evolved into parts of today's Belair Road (U.S. Route 1), Philadelphia Road (Maryland Route 7), and York Road (Maryland Route 45). The shape and orientation of the unnamed right-of-way, in part, bears close resemblance to today's Old Harford Road. Anthony Finley's 1824 map of Maryland, schematically depicts a route of travel extending north-northeast from Baltimore City to the Coopstown area of Harford County (near today's Jarrettsville, Maryland). Subsequent editions of his map and others show the route extending farther northeast to the Susquehanna River near McCall's Ferry, Pennsylvania (likely incorporating parts of today's Long <b>Green</b> <b>Pike</b> and Pleasantville Road; e.g., see the 1856 Thomas Cowperthwait and Company map shown below).|$|E

40|$|Northern pike, Esox lucius, is a nonnative species {{introduced}} into the Yampa River system in the early 1980 s. They have established a reproducing population in the upper Yampa River and expanded their number and range within the Yampa and <b>Green</b> rivers. <b>Pike</b> are voracious predators and are considered a threat as competitors and predators to endangered and other native or game fishes in the Yampa River. This project implements nonnative-fish management actions described in the Colorado Division of Wildlife Aquatic Wildlife Management Plan for the Yampa River Basin (CDOW 1998). Management activities in the Yampa Aquatic Plan recommend active trapping and translocation of northern pike, small-mouth bass, channel catfish, and white sucker. Previous sampling in 1999, resulted in the capture of 164 northern pike in both the Spawning Area near Hayden, Colorado and from backwaters in the Critical Habitat Reach, downstream of Craig, Colorado and the translocation of 80 northern pike to Yampa State Wildlife Area ponds. In 2000, 475 northern pike were captured in Critical Habitat and 350 moved to Rio Blanco Reservoir. In 2001, we focused on capturing northern pike that occupy critical habitat for Colorado pikeminnow which is downstream of Craig, Colorado and captured 268 northern pike during four sampling trips and transported them to Rio Blanco Reservoir. Sampling in Critical Habitat and translocation to Rio Blanco is planned again i...|$|R
