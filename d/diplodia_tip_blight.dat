5000|$|Sphaeropsis blight is {{a disease}} that affects pines worldwide. This disease was {{previously}} known as <b>Diplodia</b> <b>tip</b> <b>blight.</b> Sphaeropsis blight {{is considered to be}} a [...] "disfiguring disease" [...] that attacks pine trees that are growing under stressful conditions. Sphaeropsis blight does not typically kill the tree, but will significantly disfigure the tree if not properly cared for or controlled. Most commonly, Sphaeropsis blight attacks Austrian (Pinus nigra), Scots (P. sylvestris), and red (P. resinosa) pine trees. This disease is a problem in the United States, nationwide, from coast to coast, and can be found worldwide.|$|E

5000|$|When young {{cranberry}} shoots become infected, {{they show}} “tip blight” symptoms: shoot tips shrivel and a tan discoloration spreads {{from the tip}} of the shoot down the stem and into leaves. Cottonball <b>tip</b> <b>blight</b> differs from other shoot diebacks, in that tan V- or U-shaped lesions can be observed centered on the leaf midvein. Also, white, powdery conidia (asexual spores) appear on diseased shoots just before and during bloom. <b>Tip</b> <b>blight</b> of cottonball is often inconspicuous and is easily overlooked.|$|R
40|$|The {{symptoms}} and identification, disease cycle {{and control of}} Sphaeropsis <b>tip</b> <b>blight.</b> Browning and death of tips is quite common in older, well-established pine plantings. Such damage is often due to Sphaeropsis <b>tip</b> <b>blight,</b> a fungal disease caused by Sphaeropsis sapinea (syn. Diplodia pinea). Infection kills major branches and may even kill the entire tree under severe disease pressure. Sphaeropsis sapinea can infect young trees, but the disease becomes increasingly more common and destructive as trees approach 30 years of age. <b>Tip</b> <b>blight</b> commonly occurs in landscape, windbreak and park plantings; but is seldom found in natural pine stands. Several pine species can be infected. In this region the disease is most severe on Austrian pine (Pinus nigra) and ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa), {{but it can also}} damage Scots pine (P. sylvestris) and mugo pine (P. mugo) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{biotic agents}} {{responsible}} for forest decline syndromes {{are known to}} be important drivers of forest community dynamics and can have significant impacts on forest productivity (Castello et al. 1995). The biotic and abiotic factors that trigger such declines are often unknown, but Manion (1996) proposed a model in which a combination of three classes of factors leads to decline and death of trees over time: (i) predisposing (i. e. long-term) factors such as suboptimal soil fertility (Lambert 1986; Turtola et al. 2002) and reduced light intensity (Klepzig et al. 1995, 1996); (ii) inciting (i. e. shorter-term) factors such as water stress (Blodgett et al. 1997) or insect defoliation (Raffa et al. 1998); and (iii) contributing factors, such as attacks by bark beetles (Eebilgin and Raffa 2002) and root pathogens such as Armillaria spp. and Heterobasidion spp. (Cherubini et al. 2002). Some contributing factors are ultimately responsible for the tree death. How these factors affect, and in turn are affected by, tree defence mechanisms remains unclear. Secondary metabolism is known to contribute to tree resistance to pathogens (Franceschi et al. 2005; Bonello et al. 2006; Macias et al. 2007). Environmental factors can significantly affect secondary metabolism and thus host susceptibility to diseases. For example, nutrient availability, light quality and water availability can alter the synthesis and accumulation of phenolics and terpenes in conifers (e. g. Klepzig et al. 1995, 1996; Viiri et al. 2001; Blodgett et al. 2005). Diplodia pinea (Desm.) Kickx causes <b>Diplodia</b> <b>tip</b> <b>blight</b> and canker of two-needled pines of all age classes, with repeated attacks resulting in decline and eventual death (Stanosz and Cummings Carlson 1996). The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate effects of nutrient availability on constitutive resistance of Austrian pine (Pinus nigra Arnold) to D. pinea, as well as constitutive phloem concentrations of phenolic and terpenoid compounds thought to play a role in disease resistance. In companion studies, we found that nutrient availability could alter (i) the expression of systemic induced resistance in Austrian pine (Eyles et al. 2007 a); (ii) the induction of defensive proteins (Barto et al. 2008); and (iii) the metabolomic profile of Austrian pine phloem induced by fungal infection and insect defoliation (Wallis et al. 2008) ...|$|E
5000|$|Fruit rot fungi {{thrive in}} {{extended}} wet conditions. It {{has been suggested}} that incidence of disease is greatest when there are prolonged wet periods during the maturing apothecia phase, rainy spells during bloom, and an abundance of mummified berries. [...] Ditches where dense moss is growing and areas where recently applied sand is saturated for an extended time are ideal sites for more severe cases of <b>tip</b> <b>blight.</b>|$|R
5|$|Other fungi {{affect the}} {{remainder}} of the plant. Another Botrytis fungus, Botrytis polyblastis (Sclerotinia polyblastis) causes brown spots on the flower buds and stems (narcissus fire), especially in damp weather and is a threat to the cut flower industry. Ramularia vallisumbrosae is a leaf spot fungus found in warmer climates, causing narcissus white mould disease. Peyronellaea curtisii, the Narcissus leaf scorch, also affects the leaves as does its synanamorph, Phoma narcissi (leaf <b>tip</b> <b>blight).</b> Aecidium narcissi causes rust lesions on leaves and stems.|$|R

Foliar symptoms of this disease occur during the reproductive stage of soybean plants in August, but the fungi associated with the disease can cause damage during the seedling stage.

5000|$|Monilinia oxycocci (Woronin) Honey, (synonym Sclerotinia oxycocci), {{common names}} Cranberry Cottonball, Cranberry Hard Rot, <b>Tip</b> <b>Blight,</b> is a fungal {{infection}} of the cranberry plant (Vaccinium macrocarpon). The tips of young flowering shoots wilt before they flower. Fruit that forms on the plant can then be infected by the asexual spores traveling through the plant, causing the berries to harden, turn cottony on the inside, and dry out instead of maturing. [...] The berries are filled with a cotton-like fungus and are generally yellowish with tan stripes or blotches at maturity, making them unmarketable. It results in important economic impacts on many cranberry marshes, particularly in Wisconsin.|$|R
50|$|About {{the time}} of budbreak in the spring, apothecia develop from overwintered pseudosclerotia—the hardened, dried-out “mummified” remains of {{previously}} diseased fruit. Mummies are typically spherical and approximately 0.5 inches in diameter. Apothecia are generally 1 to 2 inches tall. These apothecia discharge ascospores over 10-14 days. Ascospores infect succulent young developing shoots (0.5 - 1.5 inches long), causing <b>tip</b> <b>blight.</b> This is the primary infection. Come bloom (about 3-4 weeks after primary infection), conidia are produced on the infected shoots and are dispersed to infect open flowers. Conidia borne either by wind or insect deposition may land on the flower stigma, germinate, grow down the style, and colonize the ovary. This is the secondary infection.|$|R

40|$|Diplodia pinea (syn. Sphaeropsis sapinea) and D. scrobiculata are {{destructive}} pathogens of conifer {{species in}} many parts of the world. The sensitivity of these fungi to externally applied 5 -chloro-salicylic acid on Pinus halepensis was studied. Trees treated with 2 mM 5 -chloro-salicylic acid were more resistant to the fungi than untreated trees. After 15 days of treatment shoot dieback affected 30 % of trees inoculated with D. pinea, compared to 60 % of untreated trees. D. scrobiculata caused shoot dieback in 30 % of untreated trees but only in 20 % of trees pretreated with 5 -chloro-salicylic acid. The controls never developed <b>tip</b> <b>blight.</b> The direct effect of 5 -chloro-salicylic acid on the mycelial growth of D. pinea and D. scrobiculata was tested in vitro using PDA amended with 5 -chloro-salicylic acid at five concentrations (0. 2, 1, 2, 2. 5, and 3. 0 mM). The radial growth of colonies was measured after 48 and 72 h of incubation at 24 °C. After 48 h, 5 -chloro-salicylic acid significantly inhibited mycelial growth of D. pinea at 3 mM, although there was no longer any significant difference in growth rates after 72 h of incubation. D. scrobiculata was slightly more sensitive to 5 -chloro-salicylic acid than D. pinea. After 48 h, significant differences were observed in the mean colony diameter of D. scrobiculata when directly exposed to 5 -chloro-salicylic acid at dilutions from 0 to 3 mM.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 A {{necrosis}} {{at the tip}} of cones {{was observed}} on hop (Humulus lupulus), cultivar "Nugget", grown in Oregon in the early 1990 's. Fusarium sambucinum and F. avenaceum were recovered from symptomatic cones in 1998 and preliminary inoculation experiments suggested both Fusarium species could cause hop cone necrosis. Studies were carried out to (1) examine pathogenicity and demonstrate Koch's postulates for hop cone <b>tip</b> <b>blight</b> using isolates of F. avenaceum and F. sambucinum obtained from hop cones; (2) examine isolates of F. avenaceum and F. sambucinum derived from other diseased plant hosts, and other Fusarium species derived from hop cones, for ability to cause cone necrosis; and (3) survey commercial fields to determine Fusarium populations on 'Nugget' cone parts. Isolates ofF. avenaceum and F. sambucinum recovered from diseased hop cones were used for pathogenicity experiments. In addition, cone inoculations were done with single isolates of F. avenaceum and F. sambucinum from diseased sweet corn roots, one isolate of F. sambucinum recovered from a diseased potato tuber, individual isolates of F. equiseti and F. oxysporum from hop cones. Cones of two hop cultivars, 'Nugget' and 'Willamette', were collected from three different farms on three sampling dates and inoculated with spore suspensions of hop-derived F. avenaceum and F. sambucinum at concentrations of 10 ², 1 O⁴, and 10 ⁶ conidia/ml to examine dosage effects. Necrosis was evaluated 2, 4, 6, and 8 days after inoculation. Percent cone necrosis decreased as inoculum concentration of either F. avenaceum or F. sambucinum decreased, and was lowest on water-treated cones, for all three sampling dates. The respective Fusarium species were recovered from symptomatic cones. Cone necrosis developed following cone inoculation with F. avenaceum or F. sambucinum from potato or corn. Hop cones inoculated with F. equiseti or F. oxysporum also developed necrosis, but at relatively lower levels compared to the other Fusarium species used for inoculations. For the surveys in commercial hop fields, burr and cone material were collected on five different dates. Fusarium sambucinum was recovered most frequently, but F. avenaceum was also found. Both Fusarium species were recovered from asymptomatic burr and cone materials throughout the growing season. In general, Fusarium species, F. equiseti, F. oxysporum, F. culmorum, F. solani, plus F. avenaceum and F. sambucinum were found more frequently early in the season on stigmatic tissue, and Fusarium recovery decreased as the season progressed.
