30|$|When {{comparing}} {{the amounts of}} plasticizer used in molding bioplastics from albumin, {{we found that the}} blending ratios that had the best combination of initial modulus and elasticity were the 75 : 25 albumin-water, 75 : 25 albumin-glycerol, and 80 : 20 albumin-natural Rubber. Of these blends, we found that the 80 : 20 albumin-natural rubber bioplastic provided the best thermal, viscoelastic, and tensile properties, while properties of the 75 : 25 albumin-water and 75 : 25 albumin-glycerol plastics were not comparable due to moisture loss in the water-based bioplastics over time, while glycerol leaching occurred in the glycerol-based bioplastics as time passed. There are multiple avenues of interest that should be examined {{in the light of the}} knowledge gained in this study. In order to determine whether the albumin-natural rubber (as well as albumin-water for short-term uses) plastics would be suitable for medical applications or not, further studies are needed to ensure that the plastics will inhibit bacterial growth in order to prevent post-operation infection as well as potentially aid in the application of <b>drugs</b> through <b>elution.</b> Another area of interest requiring further research is the continued modification of the blending by altering the percentages of each component used as well as adding different materials into the blends in order to reach the optimum properties for other applications.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Percutaneous {{treatment}} of coronary bifurcation lesions remains hampered by suboptimal results, {{mainly in the}} side branch (SB), even {{with the use of}} drug-eluting stents (DES). Paclitaxel drug-eluting balloons (DEB) could provide an attractive alternative to treat bifurcations in combination with a provisional T-stenting technique in order to minimize SB restenosis. We compared angiographic and clinical outcomes of a provisional T-stenting technique with a DEB plus bare-metal stent (BMS) versus BMS versus paclitaxel DES. METHODS: In this randomized, international, multicenter, single-blinded 3 -arm study, 117 patients with coronary bifurcation lesions underwent treatment with: (A) DEB in both main branch (MB) and SB and BMS in MB; (B) BMS in MB and regular balloon angioplasty in SB; or (C) paclitaxel DES in MB and regular balloon in SB. All patients underwent provisional T-stenting with an identical stent platform in the MB. Paclitaxel was the <b>drug</b> for <b>elution</b> in groups A and C. The primary endpoint was 6 -month angiographic late luminal loss. Secondary end points were 6 -month binary restenosis and 12 -month major adverse cardiac events (MACE: death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization). RESULTS: The procedure was successful in all cases. Late luminal loss, measured respectively in the proximal MB, distal MB and SB was 0. 58 ± 0. 65, 0. 41 ± 0. 60, and 0. 19 ± 0. 66 mm in group A; 0. 60 ± 0. 65, 0. 49 ± 0. 85, and 0. 21 ± 0. 57 mm in group B; and 0. 13 ± 0. 45, 0. 19 ± 0. 64, and 0. 11 ± 0. 43 mm in group C (P = 0. 001). Binary restenosis rates per bifurcation and MACE rates were 24. 2 %, 28. 6 %, and 15 % (P = 0. 45) and 20 %, 29. 7 %, and 17. 5 % (P = 0. 40) in groups A, B, and C, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pre{{treatment of}} both MB and SB with DEB failed to show angiographic and clinical superiority over conventional BMS, using a provisional T-stenting technique.

Methods and results: A virtual bench test based on explicit dynamics modelling was used to simulate procedures on bifurcated coronary vessels performed according to three different stenting techniques: provisional side branch stenting, culotte, and Tryton-based culotte. Geometrical configurations obtained after virtual stenting simulations were used to perform fluid dynamics and <b>drug</b> <b>elution</b> analyses. The results showed that substantially different patterns of mechanical deformation, shear stress and theoretical <b>drug</b> <b>elution</b> were obtained using the different techniques. Compared with conventional culotte, the dedicated Tryton seems to facilitate the intervention in terms of improved access to the main branch and to lower its biomechanical influence on the coronary bifurcation in terms of mechanical and haemodynamic parameters. However, since the Tryton stent is a bare metal stent, the <b>drug</b> <b>elution</b> obtained is lower. Conclusions: Numerical models might successfully complement the information on stenting procedures obtained with traditional approaches such as in vitro bench testing or clinical trials.

The behavior of each preparation when immersed in water was also examined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) {{in order to better}} understand the <b>drug</b> <b>elution</b> behaviour of each preparation. Viscoelasticity measurements revealed that 0. 75 ?w/v%-ι-Car and 1. 25 ?w/v%-λ-Car had viscoelasticity values equivalent to that of 0. 5 ?w/v%-κ-Car. Dissolution testing of these 3 preparations indicated that 100 % <b>drug</b> <b>elution</b> took 45 ?min with 0. 5 ?w/v%-κ-Car while it took only 5 ?min with 0. 75 ?w/v%-ι-Car and 1. 25 ?w/v%-λ-Car. When deuterium oxide was added to κ-Car 0. 5 %, the MRI images darkened overall starting immediately after addition. The images revealed that the sample and deuterium oxide quickly mixed. In contrast, images revealed that deuterium oxide gradually penetrated κ-Car 1. 0 %. MRI images had uniform contrast, and deuterium oxide took 6 ?h or longer to penetrate the samples overall. These findings suggest that water is less apt to penetrate a jelly with an increased car concentration and a denser 3 -dimensional network structure. Differences in the structure of car are said to result in better gelling, with κ having the best gelling characteristics, followed by ι and then λ. Thus, this paper discusses the role that vehicle gelling strength plays in the elution of acetaminophen. Regular Articl...|$|E

40|$|International audienceSynthetic aragonite-based porous {{materials}} were drug loaded with gentamicin sulphate, an antibiotic active on Staphylococcus aureus responsible for osteomyelitis. Drug loading {{was accomplished by}} two different ways: by integration of gentamicin in material during processing or by soaking material into gentamicin solutions. We first investigated the influence of drug loading on compressive strength of materials. Results indicate that soaked materials presented the same compressive strength than unloaded materials with the same porosity. By contrast, the integration of gentamicin during processing increased significantly the compressive strength of materials. The materials <b>drug</b> content before <b>elution</b> was a least 10 times higher when gentamicin was integrated during processing comparatively to soaked materials. The study of in vitro gentamicin release showed that for materials with gentamicin integrated during material processing, high concentrations of gentamicin were released up to 8 or 12 days, against 4 days for soaked materials. The transport coefficients calculation, for {{the first step of}} release, indicated that the rate of release was higher for materials with integrated gentamicin because of the higher gentamicin content. The porosity rate influenced the rate of release for materials positively with gentamicin integrated during processing contrary to soaked materials for which a higher porosity rate allowed a deeper penetration of gentamicin during drug loading and then a slightly slower release. Results indicate that aragonite-based material with gentamicin integrated during material processing may be used either as resorbable device for release of high concentrations of gentamicin or as biomaterial for combined therapy: bone substitution and prevention or treatment of osteomyelitis.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{sought to}} assess the feasibility, safety and {{efficacy}} of sustained intracoronary delivery of dexamethasone by a novel polymer-coated eluting stent. Background. Development of techniques to provide sustained local drug delivery has focused on polymers as matrices for <b>drug</b> incorporation and <b>elution.</b> Methods. A tantalum wire stent was coated with dexamethasone (0. 8 mg) suspended in a matrix of either low (∼ 80 kD) or high (∼ 321 kD) molecular weight poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA [0. 4 mg]). Uncoated stents, stents coated with PLLA or stents coated with dexamethasone in PLLA were overexpanded by 30 % to the normal vessel diameter in the coronary arteries of juvenile farm pigs. Animals were euthanized 28 days later, and neointimal thicknesses were measured. Additional pigs underwent placement of stents coated with high molecular weight PLLA–dexamethasone for assessment of arterial tissue and serum concentrations of dexamethasone at 1 h and 1, 2, 10 and 28 days after stent implantation. Results. In vitro dexamethasone release occurred over the first 6 days. Stents coated with low molecular weight PLLA produced an intense inflammatory neointimal response. Stents utilizing the high molecular weight PLLA were well tolerated within the coronary vessel during the 28 -day experiment. However, dexamethasone did not decrease neointimal hyperplasia. Dexamethasone concentrations in the arterial tissue were ∼ 300, 000 -fold higher {{than those in the}} serum 24 h after stent implantation, remaining ∼ 3, 000 -fold higher at 28 days. Conclusions. The eluting stent utilizing high molecular weight PLLA appeared to be a well tolerated and effective means of providing sustained, site-specific drug delivery to the porcine coronary artery wall for at least 28 days.

We verified this method upon doxorubicin elution from differently loaded TiO 2 nanotubes. Diverse elution profiles were obtained from nanotubes filled by soaking and wet vacuum impregnation methods. Impregnated nanotubes controlled drug diffusion up to thirty days, while soaked samples completed elution in seven days. FCS analysis of doxorubicin motion in loaded nanotubes clarified that more than 90 % of drugs dwell preferentially in inter-nanotube spaces in soaked samples due to decorrelation in a 2 D fashion, while a 97 % fraction of molecules showed 1 D mobility ascribable to displacements along the nanotube vertical axis of wet vacuum impregnated nanotubes.

40|$|DC Bead {{is a drug}} {{delivery}} embolisation system that can be loaded with doxorubicin or irinotecan {{for the treatment of}} a variety of liver cancers. In this study we demonstrate that the topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan hydrochloride can be successfully loaded into the DC Bead sulfonate-modified polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel matrix, resulting in a sustained-release drug eluting bead (DEBTOP) useful for therapeutic purposes. The in vitro <b>drug</b> loading capacity, <b>elution</b> characteristics and the effects on mechanical properties of the beads are described with reference to our previous work with irinotecan hydrochloride (DEBIRI). Results showed that drug loading was faster when the solution was agitated compared to static loading and a maximum loading of ca. 40 – 45 mg topotecan in 1 ml hydrated beads was achievable. Loading the drug into the beads altered the size, compressibility moduli and colour of the bead. Elution was shown to be reliant on the presence of ions to perform the necessary exchange with the electrostatically bound topotecan molecules. Topotecan was shown by MTS assay to have an IC 50 for human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (PSN- 1) of 0. 22 and 0. 27 lM compared to 28. 1 and 19. 2 lM for irinotecan at 48 and 72 h, respectively. The cytotoxic efficacy of DEBTOP on PSN- 1 was compared to DEBIRI. DEPTOP loaded at 6 & 30 mg ml- 1, like its free drug form, was shown to be more potent than DEBIRI of comparable doses at 24, 48 & 72 h using a slightly modified MTS assay. Using a PSN- 1 mouse xenograft model, DEBIRI doses of 3. 3 – 6. 6 mg were shown to be well tolerated (even with repeat administration) and effective in reducing the tumour size. DEBTOP however, was lethal after 6 days at doses of 0. 83 – 1. 2 mg but demonstrated reasonable efficacy and tolerability (again with repeat injection possible) at 0. 2 – 0. 4 mg doses. Care must therefore be taken when selecting the dose of topotecan to be loaded into DC Bead given its greater potency and potential toxicity...|$|R
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis was {{in the field of}} Forensic Toxicology, which is the study and practice of toxicology for legal purposes. Three different application areas were considered: (a) the analysis of drugs in blood by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) following isolation from the biological matrix by solid phase extraction procedures, (b) the analysis of paint solvents in blood by gas chromatography (GC) and GC-MS following dynamic headspace elution from blood, and (c) an evaluation of Thermospray/Plasmaspray (TSP/PSP LC-MS) liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry as the basis of drug screening techniques in forensic toxicology. (a) In the first of these areas, a sensitive, specific and reliable method was developed for the analysis of basic drugs in blood, using morphine and buprenorphine as model compounds which are also drugs commonly abused in the Glasgow area. A novel extraction procedure was used, based on a commercially available chemically-modified silica containing surface-bound benzenesulphonylpropyl groups, which served as a cation exchange resin. Several methods for the initial treatment of the biological matrix wre examined and the one selected involved absorption of the blood sample on diatomaceous earth and solvent elution of the crude extract containing any drugs present in the sample. This extract was then purified using the cation exchange resin: conditions suitable for the efficient retention of basic <b>drugs</b> and subsequent <b>elution</b> were also examined and developed. The extraction efficiencies for morphine were 925 % and 954 % at concentrations of 35 and 560 ng/ml blood, respectively, for buprenorphine 836 % and 875 %, at concentration of 0. 5 and 8 ng/ml respectively, and for other drugs were better than 85 %. The end-step analytical technique chosen for this method was GC-MS, because of analytical and legal requirements with respect to sensitivity and specificity. The polar nature of the model compounds, and of many other drugs likely to be encountered in this field, required chemical modification of the substances prior to gas chromatography. A comparison was made of three silyl ether derivatives - the trimethylsily (TMS), ethyldimethylsilyl (EMS) and tert-butyldimethylsilyl (MTBS) ethers. The conditions required for derivative formation were examined, including the choice of silyl donor reagent, solvents, temperature of reaction and time to completion. The EDMS donor, diethyltetramethyldisilazane, was {{selected on the basis of}} the midl reaction conditions required for the test compounds and also because this reagent caused less interference during GC-MS analysis. EDMS ethers gave satisfactory gas chromatographic behaviour and the presence of prominent ions at high mass was shown to be advantageous for specific and sensitive detection by SIR-MS with little background interference. The developed method was considered to be useful for both clinical and post-mortem blood samples containing morphine and buprenorphine down to the low picogram/millilitre level, and therefore adequate for the intended purpose. The method was subsequently applied to 13 samples submitted for analysis to the Department of Forensic Medicine and Science and found to be satisfactory. (b) In the second area of application, dynamic head space (DHS) elution was used for the analysis of paint solvents in blood. Volatilised solvents were trapped on a Tenax-GC cartridge and were subsequently analysed by GC-MS. The extraction efficiency of this method for C 18 -C 12 n-alkane hydrocarbons, which were present in the paint materials, was better than 90 % and sensitivity down to pg/ml levels was obtained. Solvent extraction procedures for these hydrocarbons were evaluated using high purity solvent. The extraction efficiency was better than 85 %. Analysis of extracts by GC or GC-MS suffered from interference from the solvent front which reduced the sensitivity. The DHS method was applied to a pilot study for occupational monitoring of a group of painters to assess the presence of paint solvents in their blood. Two venous blood samples were collected at the beginning and at the end of a working week from each subject. They showed the presence of several solvents similar to those present in paint material and the levels in the second series of samples were higher than those of the first series. The differences between the levels in the two series were statistically significant for n-nonane, n-undecane and alkylbenzenes. The levels in the first sample indicated incomplete clearance of these solvents from the body during the weekend, and the second samples indicated solvent uptake during the working week. Solvent contamination in the extraction system was tackled by several approaches but still hindered the accurate estimation of solvent levels in blood. (c) In the third area of application, the operating parameters which control the sensitivity of the mass spectrometer using the TSP/PSP LC-MS interface were evaluated. These included the effects of the probe temperature and discharge voltage on sensitivity and mass spectral fragmentation pattern and the effects of the mobile phase constituents on sensitivity and mass spectral peak stability. Solvent systems containing ammonium acetate buffer and an organic modifier such as acetonitrile produced the best results in plasmaspray LC-MS. Three model HPLC-MS analyses were developed for mixtures of basic drugs, barbiturates and opiates using both the plasmaspray positive and negative ion modes. During the development of the mobile phases, the optimization of chromatography by organic modifiers was assessed. The quality of chromatography obtained was not always as good as expected in conventional HPLC, but the combination of chromatographic and mass spectral data could be used for identification and quantification purposes. A compilation of PSP mass spectra of drugs commonly encountered in forensic toxicology was produced. These mass spectra provided mostly molecular weight information with little structural information...|$|R

However, around 10 % of patients require revision surgery within 10 years with prosthetic joint infections (PJI) as a common reason. PJI has a recurrence rate of 16 %, a mortality rate of 2. 5 %, and end-stage treatments involving arthrodesis and amputation. Most drug eluting polymers that were in development {{to address this problem}} failed due to toxic degradation products, insufficient drug release, and insufficient mechanical strength. The gold standard of treatment uses antibiotic eluting bone cement which has a mechanical failure rate of 26 - 60 % within 49 - 54 months if used under load bearing conditions. Therefore, despite advances in orthopedic materials, development of drug-eluting devices with effective, sustained delivery with the necessary mechanical strength for a fully load bearing joint implant has been elusive. Here, we report the synthesis and application of a drug eluting, fully load bearing, and articulating joint prosthesis that has superior mechanical strength and <b>drug</b> <b>elution</b> profile compared to the clinical gold standard, antibiotic eluting bone cement. We modified the eccentricity of drug clusters and percolation threshold in the polymeric matrix of Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE), which resulted in maximized <b>drug</b> <b>elution</b> and mechanical strength retention. The optimized antibiotic eluting UHMWPE elutes antibiotic at a higher concentration {{for a longer period of}} time than antibiotic eluting bone cement while retaining the mechanical and wear properties of clinically used UHMWPE joint prosthesis. After <b>drug</b> <b>elution,</b> the empty drug clusters in the polymer were filled with biological lubricants during articulation, which through a combination of weeping and elastohydrodynamic lubrication, reduced the overall wear rate of the UHMWPE. Treatment of Staphylococcus aureus infected lapine knee with the antibiotic eluting UHMWPE showed complete bacterial eradication without any detectable systemic side effect. Taken together, our study showed that the drug-eluting UHMWPE joint implants in this study are promising candidates for further clinical trial and as the next generation prosthetic joints. by Vincentius Jeremy Suhardi.

40|$|Medical {{implants}} made of non-biological materials {{provoke a}} chronic inflammatory response, {{resulting in the}} deposition of a collagenous scar tissue (ST) layer on their surface, that gradually thickens over time. This is a critical problem for neural interfaces. Scar build-up on electrodes results in a progressive decline in signal level because the scar tissue gradually separates axons away from the recording contacts. In regenerative sieves and microchannel electrodes, progressive scar deposition will constrict and may eventually choke off the sieve hole or channel lumen. Interface designs need {{to address this issue}} {{if they are to be}} fit for long term use. This study examines a novel method of inhibiting the formation and thickening of the fibrous scar. Research to date has mainly focused on methods of preventing stimulation of the foreign body response by implant surface modification.

In the drug eluting implants the scar layer was significantly thinner at all timepoints, and unlike the controls it did not continue to thicken after 6 months. Control implants supported axon regeneration well initially, but axon counts fell rapidly at later timepoints as scar thickened.

40|$|Drug eluting stents {{have made}} {{significant}} advances in reducing restenosis over bare metal stents; however, {{further research is}} required to decrease the likelihood of late stent thrombosis. Thrombosis is often caused by hypersensitivity to the stent, the polymer, and the drug. This study investigates the potential to eliminate the polymer on drug eluting stents to decrease the chance of the requirement of a second procedure to reopen the artery. Nanosecond laser texturing of metallic stent surfaces generates laser-induced periodic surface structures, {{also referred to as}} ripples, which can be utilized to promote drug adherence directly to the stent surface. Surface profilometer results demonstrated that laser texturing significantly improves surface topography over bare metal stents. With a 488 % increase in volume per unit area, laser texturing dramatically increased the volume of drug that can be contained in the valleys of the stent surface. In addition, the mean valley slope was improved by 420 %, indicating that the aspect ratio of the valleys is significantly higher resulting in a higher resistance to erosion of the drug by the flow of blood during stent placement. <b>Drug</b> <b>elution</b> trials proved that laser texturing of metallic stents offers steadier release rates and better drug adhesion than biodegradable polymer stents. Since <b>drug</b> <b>elution</b> tests are expensive to carry out to determine conditions that will yield the desired release rate, an analysis is made using the weighted property index method and the following surface characteristics: surface area ratio, surface roughness, volume of lubricant per unit area from the bearing ratio analysis, and mean valley slope. This study compared four speeds ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 25 mm/s and showed that 1. 25 mm/s produced the greatest ripple formation while minimizing process time...|$|E
40|$|Key pathophysiologic {{mechanisms}} of diabetes-related coronary disease include inflammation and a prothrombotic state. In {{the setting of}} non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes diabetic patients {{are at high risk}} for subsequent cardiovascular events. At the same time, they derive greater benefit than non-diabetic counterparts from aggressive antithrombotic therapy, early coronary angiography, and stent-based percutaneous coronary intervention. The mainstays of antithrombotic therapy for diabetic patients undergoing percutaneous revascularization include aspirin, clopidogrel, platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, and heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin. Despite dramatic reduction in restenosis conferred by drug-eluting stents, diabetic patients remain at increased risk for repeat revascularization. More efforts are needed both in terms of local <b>drug</b> <b>elution</b> as well as systemic pharmacologic therapies to further contain the excessive neointimal proliferation that characterizes the diabetic response to vascular injur...|$|E
40|$|AbstractState-of-the-art {{drug-eluting}} metal stents are {{the gold}} standard for interventional treatment of coronary artery disease. Although they overcome some disadvantages and limitations of plain balloon angioplasty and bare-metal stents, some limitations apply, most notably a chronic local inflammatory reaction due to permanent implantation of a foreign body, restriction of vascular vasomotion due to a metal cage, and the risk of late and very late stent thrombosis. The development of biodegradable scaffolds is a new approach that attempts to circumvent these drawbacks. These devices provide short-term scaffolding of the vessel and then dissolve, which should theoretically circumvent the side effects of metal drug-eluting stents. Various types of these bioresorbable scaffolds are currently under clinical evaluation. This review discusses different concepts of bioresorbable scaffolds with respect to material, design, and <b>drug</b> <b>elution</b> and presents the most recent evidence...|$|E
40|$|Endoscopic {{insertion}} of a self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) through a malignant {{common bile duct}} stricture is {{the first line of}} palliation for malignant jaundice. Patency of these stents remains a major concern. SEMS dysfunction can result from tumor ingrowth, overgrowth and/or clogging. Initial SEMS modifications involved covering {{the central part of the}} stent in order to reduce ingrowth and ultimately increase patency. Fully covered stents became available shortly after reports of their use in human patients. The potential removability and radial strength of SEMS have led to evaluation of their use in new indications including benign biliary strictures, post sphincterotomy bleeding and perforation. Other aspects of development include the addition of features such as anti-reflux valves, <b>drug</b> <b>elution</b> and spontaneous biodegradability. These aspects and their clinical implications are reviewed and discussed. JOURNAL ARTICLESCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Drug-eluting stents (DES) {{have been}} shown to be safe and {{significantly}} reduce clinical events and angiographic restenosis in the percutaneous treatment of coronary artery disease. Currently, three DES have been approved in Europe and Northern America: the sirolimus-eluting stent (SES), the paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) and the zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES). Everolimus, an analog of sirolimus, is an immunosuppressive and antiproliferative agent. In three studies, the SPIRIT I, FUTURE I and II, the everolimus-eluting stent has proven to be safe, well-tolerated and has shown very favorable clinical and angiographic results. Compared with earlier-generation DES, the XIENCE V everolimus-eluting coronary stent system (Advanced Cardiovascular Systems Inc., an Abbott Vascular Company, CA, USA) may provide enhanced deliverability, radiopacity with thinner strut filaments and, owing to a durable polymer, sustained <b>drug</b> <b>elution</b> and vascular compatibilit...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{chemistry}} and the intrinsic porous architectures of porous substrates {{play a major}} role in the design of drug delivery systems. An interesting example is the <b>drug</b> <b>elution</b> characteristic from hydrothermally synthesised titania nanotubes with tunable surface chemistry. The variation in release rates of Ibuprofen (IBU) is largely influenced by the nature of the functional groups on titania nanotubes and pH of suspending medium. To elucidate the extent of interaction between the encapsulated IBU and the functional groups on titania nanotubes, the release profiles have been modelled with an empirical Hill equation. The analysis aided in establishing a probable mechanism for the release of IBU from the titania nanotubes. The study of controlled drug release from TiO 2 has wider implication in the context of biomedical engineering. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
30|$|In our study, {{we report}} a new {{approach}} of preparing drug-eluting Ti implants {{in the form of}} Ti wires with a layer of TNT arrays fabricated as a bone fixative tool or an orthopaedic implant. A simple and cost-effective electrochemical technique was used for the synthesis of TNT arrays on Ti wire, followed by the loading of a common antibiotic drug, gentamicin. The drug loading and release of the model antibiotic drug (gentamicin) were characterised to reveal drug-eluting characteristics of our proposed implant. This system with TNT on Ti wires can be applied as a bone fixative tool, an implant or for complex bone ailments (for <b>drug</b> <b>elution</b> inside bones). The wire can easily be inserted inside the bones and could potentially open up new possibilities for enhanced bone fixation/repair and targeted treatment of bone cancer, osteomyelitis and other related orthopaedic diseases.|$|E
30|$|Since {{across all}} formulations, the {{elasticity}} of human skin rated at 18.8 MPa (Silver et al. 2007) was not surpassed, elastic modulus {{was not a}} criterion for choosing the film formulation for studying {{the release of the}} model drug 5 -FU. Chitosan, specifically the CD 0.5 formulation, was chosen over alginate as the main polymer to encapsulate 5 -FU because of its significantly higher sorption ability and superior resistance to membrane burst. Comparative <b>drug</b> <b>elution</b> profiles for the control CD 0.5 film encapsulating microspheres and 5 -FU are presented in Figure 5 c. Drug release was characterized by the absence of a lag phase (t B [*]=[*] 0) and immediate diffusion. The percentage of 5 -FU released from the CD 0.5 film is 57 % as compared to 41 % for the CD 0.5 film encapsulating the microspheres.|$|E
40|$|Background Stent {{design and}} {{technological}} modifications {{to allow for}} anti-proliferative <b>drug</b> <b>elution</b> influence restenosis rates following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We aimed to investigate whether peri-procedural administration of corticosteroids {{or the use of}} thinner strut cobalt alloy stents would reduce rates of binary angiographic restenosis (BAR) after PCI. Methods This was a two centre, mixed single and double blinded, randomised controlled trial using a factorial design. We compared (a) the use of prednisolone to placebo, starting at least six hours pre-PCI and continued for 28  days post-PCI, and (b) cobalt chromium (CoCr) to stainless steel (SS) alloy stents, in patients admitted for PCI. The primary end-point was BAR at six months. Results 315 patients (359 lesions) were randomly assigned to either placebo (n =  145) or prednisolone (n =  170) and SS (n =  160) or CoCr (n =  160).

40|$|Bisphosphonates, drugs {{typically}} {{used to prevent}} bone loss for patients with osteoporosis, {{could also be used}} to enhance bone growth into porous implants. Since systemic administration of bisphosphonates is not appropriate for all patients, {{there is a need to}} develop a localized drug delivery system and characterize the drug release. The chemical affinity of bisphosphonates for hydroxyapatite was used to temporarily bind them to hydroxyapatite coatings on porous implants. Implants were immersed in aqueous solution and the <b>drug</b> <b>elution</b> was measured using UV spectrophotometry. With hydroxyapatite coating there was an initial burst of elution followed by more gradual drug release over several weeks. Without hydroxyapatite coating, all of the drug eluted in a maximum of three hours.

40|$|We have {{developed}} nitrogen-doped TiO 2 nanotubes showing photocatalytic {{activity in the}} visible light region and have investigated the triggered release of antibiotics from these nanotubes in response to remote visible light irradiation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations indicated that the structure of TiO 2 nanotubes was not destroyed on the conditions of 0. 05 and 0. 1 [*]M diethanolamine treatment. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed that nitrogen, in the forms of nitrite (NO 2 -) and nitrogen monoxide (NO), had been incorporated into the TiO 2 nanotube surface.
