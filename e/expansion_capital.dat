Spencer’s claims that there is scope for it to expand its footprint in terms of store location as well as procuring farm products. Foodworld, which operates over 60 stores, plans to ramp up its presence to more than 200 locations. It has already tied up with Hong Kong-based Dairy Farm International. With the relaxation in international investments in Indian retail, India’s Foodworld expects its global relationship will only get stronger. Competition and investment in retail will provide more benefits to consumers through lower prices, wider availability and significant improvement in supply chain logistics.|$|E

5000|$|An {{investor}} lead {{is a type}} of a sales lead.

Investor leads are considered to have some disposable income that they can use to participate in appropriate investment opportunities in exchange for return on investment in the form of interest, dividend, profit sharing or asset appreciation. Investor lead lists are normally generated through investment surveys, investor newsletter subscriptions or through companies raising capital and selling the database of people who expressed an interest in their opportunity. Investor lead lists are further sold to businesses by lead brokers such as InvestorLeads.com, UmbrellaCapitalManagement.com, InfoUsa.com, Harris Info Source, FNIN, InvestorInspector.com and many others.

5000|$|Tamsier was {{a former}} {{director}} of Bluewings Employment Security & Training Limited and Blue Light Training Services Limited both of which he resigned from and now runs his own businesses. He is an investor in African businesses seeking start-up or <b>expansion</b> <b>capital</b> through MYC4. Tamsier was also the founder of the Seereer Resource Centre (SRC), an organisation he conceived in 2008. The SRC preserves and promotes Seereer culture. Tamsier is a member of that ethic group. He is also the founder of Seereer Radio which broadcast 24/7 for the Serer and Senegambian community. Tamsier is a presenter on Seereer Radio and is the main anchor on the Cosaan Seereer Show, a weekly cultural program which he co-hosts with Demba Sene, Mamadou Fall, Moussoukoro Sidibé and new host Laity Sene. He is also a regular on the Open Mike Show presented by Mamadou Fall. Tamsier is a strong opponent of President Yahya Jammeh's regime and regular speaks out against the brutality of the Jammeh regime on Seereer Radio, and occasionally on Gainako Radio. Tamsier regularly visits the Gambia to report on the country's political situation for Seereer Radio. He covered the trial of lawyer Ousainou Darboe and his Executive Committee, the 9th May 2016 political prisoners - imprisoned for demanding electrical reform and the Gambian presidential election, 2016. He is one of few Gambian radio presenters living in the diaspora that regularly criticises the Jammeh regime yet continues to enter the country. Whilst he was still in the Gambia covering the 2016 presidential election and the release of Ousainou Darboe from jail, he continued to criticise the brutality of the Jammeh regime as he has done on previous visits. When asked by his colleagues whether he fears for his life being so candid about his criticism of the Jammeh regime, he replied [...] "I may not be born here but my grandparents were born here and have fought and died for this country. If I do not have more stake in this country than Jammeh, then Jammeh certainly does not have more stake in this country than me." [...] On the same topic, Tamsier had said on the Open Mike and Cosaan Seereer shows that [...] "a real Serer does not fear death." [...] He is also known for carrying out investigative journalism against the Jammeh regime and his enablers and outing them on the radio. He is one of few radio critics of Jammeh to have interviewed President-Elect Adama Barrow face-to-face on Gambian soil (done at least twice). The first being Barrow's election campaign in Bakau on 29 November 2016, and after his victory in the 2016 presidential election - face-to-face interview at the Kairaba Hotel on 7 December 2016.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, many {{well-known}} foreign-funded enterprises have accelerated their pace of sole-proprietorship in China.

Thus, I here present the paper on the tendency of sole proprietorship for foreign-funded enterprises in China, taking the American-funded ones as the specification of the analysis, with a view to providing our countermeasures from the global perspective. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of discrete event simulation {{in the process}} industries is commonly used {{for the analysis of}} reliability and maintenance improvements. However there have been increasing applications that go beyond this traditional area of application to include evaluations for chemical plant <b>expansions,</b> <b>capital</b> investment options, cycle time reduction and safety, in presence of failure prone components. This paper will present three case studies to demonstrate the use of discrete event simulation for such applications. The first case study demonstrates the use of discrete event simulation to identify critical failure modes for a plant characterized by discrete and continuous product flow. The second study involves the evaluation of <b>capital</b> <b>expansion</b> decisions in presence of different failures and identification of critical components affecting plant throughput. The third case study shows the use of simulation of verify the designed production capacity of a subsystem in presence of different failures and operational constraints. The goal {{of this paper is to}} show the potential of discrete event simulation for such problems, and to present examples of best practices for the scoping and execution of simulation projects in the process industries. ...|$|R

40|$|The turmoils {{occurred}} in East Asia in the 1990 s have reminded {{the world of}} how rapidly and with what disruptive forte financia 1 crises can erupt, and of {{how difficult it is}} to foresee the timing and full ramifications of these dramatic events. In this way, the paper examines the financia 1 system distress and crises in Argentina between 1977 and 1998 (post-Financia 1 Reform period). The paper uses a vector error correction model developed by Johansen and the empirical results identify several adverse macroeconomic shocks that may explain financia 1 crises. We find that financial crises tend to emerge with the following: a fall in real GDP growth, credit <b>expansion,</b> <b>capital</b> outflows, rising M 2 /intemational reserves ratio, a decline in the real exchange rate and adverse trade shocks. The paper also shows that a weak macroeconomic environment (low GDP growth) is significant in predicting financial crises. The paper concludes that to better manage crises; policymakers should develop a regulatory framework that allows banks to respond more robustly to adverse macroeconomic shocks. ...|$|E
