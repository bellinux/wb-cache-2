5|$|Draught beer's {{environmental}} impact can be 68% lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences. A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, {{shows that the}} CO2 <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> a 6-pack of micro-brew beer is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew beer {{is estimated to be}} 2.5 square metres (26 square feet). Downstream <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> distribution, retail, storage and disposal of waste can be over 45% of a bottled micro-brew beer's CO2 emissions. Where legal, the use of a refillable jug, reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar, rather than buying pre-bottled beer, can reduce the {{environmental impact}} of beer consumption.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, it {{was found}} that the {{variation}} of radio <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> the planet did not match Saturn's rotation rate. This variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} film {{stiffness}} and thickness on the stress field of a film-covered mode III crack and the dislocation dipole <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> {{the interface between}} the film and the substrate have been studied. The {{results show that the}} image force and interaction force between the two dislocations that form a dipole with a core size of 2 b are functions of the film stiffness, but weakly depend on the film thickness when the thickness is larger than 20 b. The emission of the dislocation dipole from the interface becomes more difficult if the film is harder than the substrate and its thickness is large and vice versa. Dislocation <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> the crack tip occurs prior to dislocation dipole <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> the interface. When the film is softer than the substrate, both the critical applied stress intensity factor for dislocation <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> the crack tip and the critical applied stress intensity factor for dislocation dipole <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> the interface are larger than that for dislocation <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> a crack tip without any film...|$|R

5|$|Oil-shale {{extraction}} {{can damage}} the biological and recreational value of land and the ecosystem in the mining area. Combustion and thermal processing generate waste material. In addition, the atmospheric <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> oil shale processing and combustion include carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.

5|$|One {{issue that}} has often raised {{concerns}} {{is the use of}} cadmium (Cd), a toxic heavy metal that has the tendency to accumulate in ecological food chains. It is used as semiconductor component in CdTe solar cells and as buffer layer for certain CIGS cells in the form of CdS. The amount of cadmium used in thin-film PV modules is relatively small (5–10 g/m²) and with proper recycling and emission control techniques in place the cadmium <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.3–0.9 microgram/kWh over the whole life-cycle. Most of these emissions arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and lignite combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium. Life-cycle cadmium <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> coal is 3.1 microgram/kWh, lignite 6.2, and natural gas 0.2 microgram/kWh.|$|E

Soil can be contaminated through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes, lead paint, and residual <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> leaded gasoline.|$|E

40|$|The present work {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} a passive film, formed at a mode III crack tip during stress corrosion cracking, on screw dislocation <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> the film-covered crack tip and on the screw dislocation dipole <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> the interface between the film and the substrate. The results show that the crack stress field due to the applied load is enhanced by a harder film or abated by a softer film. The critical stress intensity factor for dislocation <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> the film-covered crack tip and the critical stress intensity factor for dislocation dipole <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> the interface are greatly influenced by the film stiffness and the film thickness. When the film is softer than the substrate, both the critical applied stress intensity factors are larger than that for dislocation <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> a crack tip not covered by a film.

5|$|Americium-241 {{has been}} used as a {{portable}} source of both gamma rays and alpha particles for a number of medical and industrial uses. The 59.5409keV gamma ray <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> 241Am in such sources can be used for indirect analysis of materials in radiography and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, as well as for quality control in fixed nuclear density gauges and nuclear densometers. For example, the element has been employed to gauge glass thickness to help create flat glass. Americium-241 is also suitable for calibration of gamma-ray spectrometers in the low-energy range, since its spectrum consists of nearly a single peak and negligible Compton continuum (at least three orders of magnitude lower intensity). Americium-241 gamma rays were also used to provide passive diagnosis of thyroid function. This medical application is however obsolete.|$|E
5|$|An {{emissions}} trading scheme for {{greenhouse gas emissions}} (GHGs) works by establishing property rights for the atmosphere. The atmosphere is a global public good, and GHG emissions are an international externality (p.21). The <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> all sources of GHGs contribute to the overall stock of GHGs in the atmosphere. In the cap-and-trade variant of {{emissions trading}}, a limit on access to a resource (the cap) is defined and then allocated among users {{in the form of}} permits. Compliance is established by comparing actual emissions with permits surrendered including any permits traded within the cap. The environmental integrity of emissions trading is depends on the setting of the cap, not the decision to allow trading.|$|E

In addition, such a detector may determine the <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> the decay of ^(126) Sn in the Vela supernova remnant and the diffuse <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> the decay of ^(126) Sn produced by past supernovae in our Galaxy. The required detector sensitivity is similar to what is projected for the proposed Advanced Telescope for High Energy Nuclear Astrophysics (ATHENA). Both the detection of gamma-ray <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> the decay of several r-process nuclei (e. g.,^(125) Sb and ^(194) Os) produced in future Galactic supernovae and the detection of <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> the decay of ^(126) Sn in the Vela supernova remnant would prove that supernovae are a site of the r-process. Furthermore, the former detection {{would allow us to}} determine whether or not the r-process nuclei are produced in relative proportions specified by the solar r-process abundance pattern in supernova r-process events.
