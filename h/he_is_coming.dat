Throughout his stay in France, Karamanlis was a vocal {{opponent}} of the Regime of the Colonels, the military junta that seized power in Greece in April 1967. He was now called to end his self-imposed exile and restore democracy to the place that originally created it: Greece.

Έρχεται! <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming!</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming!</b> Similar celebrations broke out all over Greece. Athenians in their thousands also went to the airport to greet him. Karamanlis was sworn-in as Prime Minister under President pro tempore Phaedon Gizikis who remained in power in the interim, till December 1974, for legal continuity reasons until a new constitution could be enacted during metapolitefsi and was subsequently replaced by duly elected President Michail Stasinopoulos.|$|E

The Mikado has decreed that executions must resume without delay in Titipu. When news arrives that the Mikado will be visiting the town, Ko-Ko assumes that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> to ascertain whether Ko-Ko has carried out the executions.

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of Series 5, set {{three months after the}} birth, Rachel appears overprotective of Matthew; she refuses to let Adam hold him and never lets him out of her sight. After Adam abruptly leaves Matthew's naming ceremony, feeling unable to love his child because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> between him and his wife, Rachel reveals that the baby fell off the kitchen table when she left him unattended for a matter of seconds. Baxendale said of the story, [...] "Rachel's take on motherhood is quite real in my experience because she's had such trouble conceiving for a start and then all the problems with the birth [...] She becomes obsessed with the baby and excludes Adam from everything. They have to work hard to resolve their differences and there is a big transition. I can see why she behaves the way she does—you do become over-protective with a baby. It's amazing what your body does to you and the instincts that suddenly take over. Being a mum myself, I have got real empathy with Rachel."

500|$|On 25 July 2014, Chelsea {{announced}} on their official website that Drogba completed {{his return to}} the club on a free transfer, and signed a one-year contract. Speaking on his move back to the club, Drogba said: [...] "It was an easy decision. I couldn't turn down the opportunity to work with José Mourinho again. Everyone knows the special relationship I have with this club and it has always felt like home to me." [...] Mourinho also commented on the transfer, saying: [...] "He's coming because he's one of the best strikers in Europe. I know his personality very well and I know if he comes back he's not protected by history or what he's done for this club previously. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> with the mentality to make more history." [...] On 28 July 2014, Chelsea announced that Drogba would wear the number 15 shirt which he wore when he first signed for the club in 2004.

500|$|Connor’s {{characterization}} {{and main}} storyline {{with his father}} in season three and four received mixed reviews. Ben from thescifichristian.com was not fond of the initial episodes with baby Connor because Angel wasted time “baby-talking,” but he loved the development with teenage Connor, “The [...] season ends with a great storyline as Connor returns [...] and betrays Angel.” Jes Battis praised the father/son dynamics and described as “highly dramatic and (engagingly perverse)”. Journalist Sarah D. Bunting called Connor [...] "a frustrating character" [...] and wrote that while she [...] "gets where <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> from" [...] and his ”twitchy, PTSD-ish interactions ring true", they become old too quick {{due to lack of}} real development of character and the relationship with Angel for most of season four. Kartheiser himself expressed this development concern, but he said that [...] "Towards {{the end of the season}} I was really happy about the chances I was getting." [...] This last statement is echoed in Jamie Pool's review, who called the “ending” to Connor [...] "emotionally satisfying", despite noting him to not have been particularly endearing through most of the remaining season. S.Wiebe of eclipsemagazine.com, described Connor’s overall characterization [...] "sharp" [...] with [...] "really intriguing sub-textual material" [...] and among the saving graces of the season. Strega of Television Without Pity, also praised the character's psychology, [...] "The thing I like most is that they've not only created a teenager who doesn't just feel like he's the most alienated person in the world -- he actually is," [...] and [...] "I love how unloved Connor [...] is…” Jean Lorrah described the Darla-Angel-Connor-Jasmine arc as [...] "surely one of the most ambitious story arcs any television show has ever attempted“ Stacey Abbott of PopMatters called the Darla-Angel-Connor storyline [...] "provocative" [...] and [...] "pure family melodrama".

2500|$|On 1 July 1999, after 364 {{appearances}} and 66 goals for Liverpool, McManaman transferred to Real Madrid as Guus Hiddink's last signing (before being sacked, {{and while the}} club was under president Lorenzo Sanz). Before McManaman arrived, the club was described as undergoing a management and debt crisis and Raúl told the press, [...] "The dressing room is a cesspit of lies, treachery and whispers... I feel sorry for new players like Steve McManaman coming into the club. If McManaman thinks <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> {{to one of the}} world's top clubs then he has made a big mistake." [...] The club appointed John Toshack as its new coach and had already been forced to sell key players like Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker and Christian Panucci due to mounting debt, while Clarence Seedorf was also released shortly after McManaman arrived. McManaman's arrival saw him become only the second English player to ever play for the club, after Laurie Cunningham had played for them in the 1980s. He was also the most high-profile English footballer to move to Spanish football since Gary Lineker had moved to Barcelona from Everton in 1986. Thereafter he proved an instant hit with the fans at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium after scoring three times and creating several goals in his first few games for Los Merengues.|$|E
