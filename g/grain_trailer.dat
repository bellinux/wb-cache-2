50|$|During {{the second}} collision, the tractor and trailer of the Military Distributors truck {{separated}} and the tractor turned over on its right side into the northbound lane. The cab {{burst into flames}} and {{the driver of the}} tractor was killed. The front of the <b>grain</b> <b>trailer</b> also caught fire but the driver of that vehicle was able to escape. The driver and passenger in the automobile sustained minor injuries.|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Anthropogenic vectors {{enhance the}} natural {{dispersal}} capacity of plant seeds significantly {{in terms of}} quantity and distance. Human-mediated seed dispersal (i. e. anthropochory) greatly increases the dispersal of crop species across agroecosystems. In the case of oilseed rape (OSR), spillage of seeds from <b>grain</b> <b>trailers</b> during harvest has never been quantified. METHODS: Our experimental approach involved establishing 85 seed trap-sites on the road verges of an agricultural area around the grain silo of Selommes (Loir-et-Cher, France). We recorded OSR spillage during harvest and applied a linear model to the data. RESULTS: The amount of seed spilled was related positively {{to the area of}} the OSR fields served by the road, whereas the amount of seed spilled decreased with other variables, such as distance from the trap-site to the verge of the road and to the nearest field. The distance to the grain silo, through local and regional effects, affected seed loss. Local effects from fields adjacent to the road resulted in a cumulative spillage on one-lane roads. On two-lane roads, spillage was nearly constant whatever the distance to the silo due to a mixture of these local effects and of <b>grain</b> <b>trailers</b> that joined the road from more distant fields. From the data, we predicted the number of seeds lost from <b>grain</b> <b>trailers</b> on one road verge in the study area. We predicted a total spillage of 2. 05 × 10 (6) seeds (± 4. 76 × 10 (5)) along the road length, which represented a mean of 404 ± 94 seeds per m(2). CONCLUSION: Containment of OSR seeds will always be challenging. However, seed spillage could be reduced if <b>grain</b> <b>trailers</b> were covered and filled with less seed. Reducing distances travelled between fields and silos could also limit seed loss...|$|R
50|$|A <b>grain</b> hopper <b>trailer</b> is {{a trailer}} pulled by a semi tractor {{and used to}} haul bulk {{commodity}} products (such as <b>grain).</b> These <b>trailers</b> are used extensively throughout the United States to transport agricultural products {{as well as any}} other commodity that can be hauled in bulk and loaded and unloaded through the trailer.|$|R
50|$|A <b>grain</b> hopper <b>trailer</b> {{is used in}} {{conjunction}} with various other pieces of agricultural machinery to complete the harvest of a field. Combine harvesters or similar unload the harvest into grain carts, which in turn unload their load into a <b>grain</b> hopper <b>trailer,</b> for long distance transportation. The trailers are then unloaded into low-profile grain augers for transportation to, and long-term storage in, grain bins, also known as silo's.|$|R
50|$|The typical setup of a chaser bin is a cross auger, which {{feeds the}} folding unload auger, {{which in turn}} empties the {{contents}} into waiting <b>Grain</b> hopper <b>trailers</b> or mother bins.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "grain auger" [...] {{is used in}} {{agriculture}} to move grain from trucks, grain carts or <b>grain</b> <b>trailers</b> into <b>grain</b> storage bins (from where it is later removed by gravity chutes at the bottom). A grain auger may be powered by an electric motor; a tractor, through the power take-off; or sometimes an internal combustion engine mounted on the auger. The helical rotates inside a long metal tube, moving the grain upwards. On the lower end, a hopper receives grain from the truck or grain cart. A chute on the upper end guides the grain into the destination location.|$|R
50|$|<b>Grain</b> hopper <b>trailers</b> {{typically}} {{feature a}} rolling tarp {{on the top}} of the trailer, to enable easy loading of the product to be transported, and also offer protection during transport. They utilize two hoppers on the base of the trailer to unload to product, one servicing the rear half of the trailer, the other the front half. The output of these hoppers is usually controlled by a sliding plate on the base of the hopper, controlled by a user-operated crank handle.|$|R
50|$|By the 1980s {{the system}} would own 11,469 miles of rail line over 11 states bounded by Chicago to the east, Pueblo, Colorado, in the west, north to Omaha, south to the U.S.-Mexico border in Laredo, Texas, and {{southeast}} along the Gulf seaports of Louisiana and Texas. MoPac operated a fleet of more than 1,500 diesel locomotives, almost all purchased within the previous 10 years. Under the leadership of Downing B. Jenks, who became {{president and chief executive}} in 1961 the company became a pioneer {{in the early days of}} computer-guided rail technology. It was a major hauler of <b>grain,</b> TOFC (<b>Trailer</b> on Flat Car), coal, ore, autos and dry goods. At the time of their mega-merger in 1982 the MoPac owned newer locomotives, more locomotives and operated more track than partner Union Pacific Railroad.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} harvest of cereals {{in terms of}} noise pollution. Sources of noise during {{harvesting}} are harvest line (combine harvester), manipulation equipment transporting harvested <b>grain</b> (tractors with <b>trailers)</b> {{and in some cases}} harvesters straw (tractors with collectors). The main aim of this work is to measure noise at harvest on the outskirt of the crop land. In this work I focused on the selection of suitable observation post, measurement of noise pollution of particular agricultural machines, background noise measurement and evaluation of climatic conditions. Furthermore, acquired data are used for equivalent noise level calculations and evaluation against current legislation. Based on the data analysis can be concluded that noise pollution during harvest does not negatively impact its surroundings, therefore {{there is no need for}} any action to reduce noise exposure...|$|R
40|$|Sensing is an {{important}} element to quantify productivity, product quality and to make decisions. Applications, such as mapping, surveillance, exploration and precision agriculture, require a reliable platform for remote sensing. This paper presents the first steps towards {{the development of a}} smart flying sensor based on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The concept of smart remote sensing is illustrated and its performance tested for the task of mapping the volume of <b>grain</b> inside a <b>trailer</b> during forage harvesting. Novelty lies in: (1) the development of a position-estimation method with time delay compensation based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors and image processing; (2) a method to build a 3 D map using information obtained from a regular camera; and (3) the design and implementation of a path-following control algorithm using model predictive control (MPC). Experimental results on a lab-scale system validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology...|$|R
