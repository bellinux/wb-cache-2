In this paper, the residential load data from Ausgrid combined with local weather data is used to develop an expert system, which can predict air-conditioner existence and identify usage patterns. The promising prediction performance illustrates that this expert system {{can be used as}} an accessorial tool by demand response sponsors. Due to many barriers, the current <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> management measures targeting air conditioners is relatively slow. Governments and policy makers should work together to encourage demand response programs with generous subsidies and with regulatory support. In the near future, the widespread demand response programs will {{play a critical role in}} shifting air-conditioning peak load.|$|E

Thus, with perfect knowledge of the future a cost optimal solution can be achieved. Evidently though, the future is uncertain. In this thesis an approach known as stochastic programming is used to increase robustness against random fluctuations in demand and equipment cost. Several future scenarios are consid-ered and weighted with probabilities. It is shown that by using stochastic programming the robustness of multiperiod network planning concerning different types <b>of</b> uncertainty (<b>demand</b> allocation, <b>demand</b> increase, <b>development</b> <b>of</b> equipment cost) can be increased and infeasibilities in routing can be prevented. ii...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDemand {{response}} is a cornerstone problem in electricity markets under climate change constraints. Most liberalized electricity markets have a poor track record at encouraging {{the deployment of}} smart meters and the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> response. In Europe, different models are considered for demand response, from a development under a regulated regime to a development under competitive perspectives. In this paper focusing on demand response and smart metering for mid-­‐size and small consumers, we investigate which types of market signals {{should be sent to}} demand managers to see demand response emerge as a competitive activity. Using data from the French power system over nine years, we compare the possible market design options which would enable the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> response. Our simulations demonstrate that under the current market rules demand {{response is}} not a profitable activity in the French electricity industry. Introducing a capacity market could bring additional revenues to demand response providers and improve incentives to put in place demand response programs in a market environment...|$|E

40|$|In the EU dairy sector, {{given the}} {{remaining}} high protective tariffs and the quota system, the main factor that drives dairy product market prices is the demand. This paper evaluates the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> in the EU and presents estimates of consumption trends and forecasts {{for the future}} as well as estimates of elasticity with respect to prices and income in two major EU consumer countries: France and Italy. We use two methods to estimate the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> for dairy products, one based on a multi-stage demand system and another based on a single trend equation. The two methods generally lead to the same qualitative results but trend projections are larger using the demand system approach {{which is based on}} a shorter data period. This difference is thus partly {{explained by the fact that}} high trend projections are not sustainable over a long period. The results show a decreasing consumption of butter and fluid milk and an overall growth in protein and fat consumption. Nevertheless, the increase in fat consumption should be more moderate than the consumption of protein. The results also show that the demand for dairy products is relatively price inelastic but is more sensitive to changes in income (especially for butter and cheese categories). As shown by the use of a partial equilibrium model of dairy markets, the likely impact of the CAP reform strongly depends on the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> for dairy products in the EU. More research effort on demand analysis is therefore crucial in order to assess the impact of reforms or trade negotiations more accurately and effectively.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the <b>demand</b> chain alignment competence {{and the role}} of product life cycle (PLC) management for the competence building process. Design/methodology/approach - Presents an overview of the literature on demand chain alignment competence, and on the PLC and demand/supply chain strategies, putting forward associated propositions. Explores the propositions through a case study of a global tobacco company, which focused on the role of PLC management for demand chain alignment, and the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> an integrated <b>demand</b> chain strategy for effective PLC management, incorporating customer strategy, linking customer strategy to supply chain strategy, and applying the aligned process to PLC management. Findings: Offers no clear evidence <b>of</b> the <b>demand</b> chain alignment competence being a source of competitive advantage, but confirms that PLC management is not only supported by demand chain alignment, but can trigger the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the competence; and that the PLC does not sufficiently represent the marketing dimension within the demand chain alignment competence.
