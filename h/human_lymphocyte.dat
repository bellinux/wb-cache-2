Little is known about toxicity of Cry 1 Ac toxin of Bt cotton. This study presents the cytotoxic and genotoxic effect of crude Cry 1 Ac toxin extract on <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> using MTT test, cytokinesis blocked micronucleus assay and erythrolysis tests as parameters. The exposure of <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> with increasing doses of toxin showed decreased cell survivability (47. 08 %) at 72 h incubation.

40|$|The {{protective}} effects of resveratrol and 4 -hexylresorcinol against oxidative DNA damage in <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> induced by hydrogen peroxide were investigated. Resveratrol and 4 -hexylresorcinol showed no cytotoxicity to <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> at the tested concentration (10 - 100 muM). In addition, DNA damage in <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> induced by H 2 O 2 was inhibited by resveratrol and 4 -hexylresorcinol. Resveratrol and 4 -hexylresorcinol at concentrations of 10 - 100 muM induced {{an increase in}} glutathione (GSH) levels in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, these two compounds also induced activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione reductase (GR). The activity of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was induced by resveratrol. Resveratrol and 4 -hexylresorcinol inhibited the activity of catalase (CAT). These data indicate that the inhibition of resveratrol and 4 -hexylresorcinol on oxidative DNA damage in <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> induced by H 2 O 2 might be attributed to increase levels of GSH and modulation of antioxidant enzymes (GPX, GR and GST) ...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Master of Science thesis. September 2014. Major: Comparative and Molecular Biosciences. Advisor: Dan S. Kaufman. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); v, 82 pages. Human {{pluripotent stem cells}} {{have the potential to}} produce essentially unlimited numbers of mature and functional blood lineage populations to study human hematopoiesis. Particularly, human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have the advantage to provide a source of autologous transplantable blood cell populations suitable for treatment of patient specific hematological diseases. This research aims to derive <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from hiPSCs. There are three projects: The overall generation of <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (B cell, T cell and NK cell) from hiPSCs is explored in Project I. In Project II and III, based on the derivation of NK cells, two human immunodeficiency disease models, both caused by specific somatic gene mutation, are established using human pluripotent stem cells. The ultimate goal of this research is to use hiPSCs to study the normal development of <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> in vitro, as well as model human immunodeficiency diseases by combining with gene therapy methods, thus providing a novel approach for immunotherapy. The hypothesis is that <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> can be derived from hiPSCs and this will enable the establishment of in vitro models to study human immunodeficiency diseases. Specific aims: 1. To generate <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from hiPSCs in vitro; 2.

40|$|Treatment of cultured bovine brain {{microvascular}} endothelial cells (BMECs) with interleukin 1 beta (IL- 1 beta), {{an inflammatory}} cytokine, {{was shown to}} induce the accumulation of sulfoglucuronosyl paragloboside (SGPG), a glycolipid bearing the HNK- 1 epitope. This resulted in the attachment of {{a greater number of}} <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> to the treated than to the untreated BMEC monolayers. Attachment of <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> to the IL- 1 beta-activated BMEC cells could be blocked either by incubation of the <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> with an anti-L-selectin antibody or by application of an anti-SGPG antibody to the BMECs.
