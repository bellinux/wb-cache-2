500|$|Gill was {{commissioned}} {{to develop his}} alphabet into a full metal type family by his friend Stanley Morison, an influential Monotype executive and historian of printing. Morison hoped {{that it could be}} Monotype's competitor to a wave of German sans-serif families in a new [...] "geometric" [...] style, which included Erbar, Futura and <b>Kabel,</b> all being launched to considerable attention in Germany during the late 1920s. Gill Sans was released in 1928 by Monotype, initially as a set of titling capitals that was quickly followed by a lower-case. Gill's aim was to blend the influences of Johnston, classic serif typefaces and Roman inscriptions to create a design that looked both cleanly modern and classical at the same time.|$|E
500|$|After the Germans {{suppressed}} the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, they sent Rejewski's {{wife and children}} west, along with other Warsaw survivors; the family eventually found refuge with her parents in Bydgoszcz. [...] Rejewski was discharged from the Polish Army in Britain on 15 November 1946. [...] Six days later, he returned to Poland {{to be reunited with}} his wife and family. [...] On his return, he was urged by his old Poznań University professor, Zdzisław Krygowski, to take a university mathematics post at Poznań or Szczecin, in western Poland. [...] Rejewski could have looked forward to rapid advancement because of personnel shortages {{as a result of the}} war. However, he was still recovering from rheumatism, which he had contracted in the dank Spanish prisons. Soon after his return to Poland, in the summer of 1947, his 11-year-old son Andrzej died of polio after only five days' illness. [...] After his son's death, Rejewski did not want to part, even briefly, with his wife and daughter, so they lived in Bydgoszcz with his in-laws. [...] Rejewski took a position in Bydgoszcz as director of the sales department at a cable-manufacturing company, <b>Kabel</b> Polski (Polish Cable).|$|E

2500|$|The use of Akzidenz-Grotesk {{and similar}} [...] "grotesque" [...] typefaces dipped {{from the late}} 1920s due {{to the arrival of}} fashionable new [...] "geometric" [...] sans-serifs such as Erbar, Futura and <b>Kabel,</b> based on the {{proportions}} of the circle and square.

2500|$|In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Discovery Channel {{is part of}} the Premiere {{digital network}} and {{supplies}} specific programs to other networks like ZDF and <b>kabel</b> eins. Discovery Communications is also owner of the documentary-channel XXP. The channel was bought in the spring of 2006 from its former shareholders Spiegel TV and [...] "dctp". All programs are dubbed into German. The channel is now known as [...] "DMAX", presumably to associate the channel with Discovery.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{music video}} shown on MTV was The Buggles' [...] "Video Killed the Radio Star", {{originally}} only available to homes in New Jersey. This {{was followed by}} the video for Pat Benatar's [...] "You Better Run". Sporadically, the screen would go black when an employee at MTV inserted a tape into a VCR. MTV's lower third graphics that appeared near {{the beginning and end of}} music videos would eventually use the recognizable <b>Kabel</b> typeface for about 25 years. But these graphics differed on MTV's first day of broadcast; they were set in a different typeface and included information such as the year and record label name.|$|E
2500|$|The {{programs}} were licensed {{for more than}} 40 (43 as of 2007) TV shows around the world, tailored to individual markets. Many of more than half billion viewers believed that the program is native to their countries, as Hugo spoke Danish only in Denmark. On German-language <b>kabel</b> eins, {{there was also a}} spin-off show titled Hexana-Schloss ("Hexana's [...] Castle"). A more advanced show [...] (Hugo Vulkanøen) premiered in January 1999. Some German Hugo items were released exclusively for the fanclub Den Faktyrlige Bogklub (Hugo's Book Club), which was established in co-operation with the German publisher Carlsen Verlag in 1999. A [...] "giant" [...] Hugo theme park also has been considered at one point circa 2000.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{challenge}} from Timberlake, MTV continued to decrease its total rotation time for music videos in 2007, {{and the channel}} eliminated its long-running special tags for music videos such as [...] "Buzzworthy" [...] (for under-represented artists), [...] "Breakthrough" [...] (for visually stunning videos), and [...] "Spankin' New" [...] (for brand new videos). Additionally, the historic <b>Kabel</b> typeface, which MTV displayed {{at the beginning and}} end of all music videos since 1981, was phased out in favor of larger text and less information about the video's record label and director. The classic font can still be seen in [...] "prechyroned" [...] versions of old videos on sister network MTV Classic, which had their title information recorded onto the same tape as the video itself.|$|E
2500|$|The fourth {{major change}} {{came in the}} 1966–67 season, when the logo was changed to an 11-point leaf, similar to the leaf on the then-new flag of Canada to commemorate the Canadian Centennial. Before the 1970–71 season, the Leafs adopted a new 11-point leaf logo, with a <b>Kabel</b> bold-font [...] "Toronto" [...] going {{straight}} across, running parallel to the other words. Other changes to the sweater removed the arm stripes, extended the yoke {{to the end of}} the sleeves, added a solid stripe on the waist, three stripes on the stockings and a miniature Leaf crest on the shoulders. In 1973, the jersey's neck was a lace tie-down design, before the V-neck returned in 1976. In 1977, player names were added to the away jerseys and in 1979 to the home jerseys, but not until after the Leafs were fined by the NHL for refusing to comply with a new rule.|$|E
2500|$|By late on 9 July, II and III battalions, IR 183 {{held the}} <b>Kabel</b> and Roedergraben and I Battalion was in reserve at Pozières; the I Battalion, RIR 122 garrisoned Contalmasion and the Kaisergraben to the west, the III Battalion held Quadrangle Support and Wood Support and the II Battalion was in reserve {{in the second}} {{position}} behind Contalmaison Villa. The 5th Company, II Battalion was sent to reinforce the 9th Company in Wood Support, which had lost [...] of its men in a bombardment. Another company was sent into Mametz Wood, leaving only the 6th and 7th companies left in reserve. II Battalion, IR Lehr remained along {{the south side of}} the wood and Flat Iron Copse, with the III Battalion in reserve around Bazentin le Petit.(The defence of this part of the German front had been conducted by 15 battalions on 1 July (BRIR 6, IR 62, RIR 109,110 and 111) and from 2 July, troops from the 12th Reserve Division, elements of the 185th, 12th, 10th Bavarian and 3rd Guard divisions and IR 163 of the 17th Reserve Division had joined the defence; the 183rd Division was en route to the Somme front.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{troops of}} the 2nd Company in the {{south-eastern}} part of the village were trapped and a counter-attack towards the road junction south of the church was defeated. The company retreated along Pearl Alley, a rearguard holding the Cutting until dark fell. The survivors of the 6th, 10th, 11th and 12th companies in Quadrangle Support Trench were enveloped on three sides and reduced to drinking muddy water from the trench bottom but no attack came. After dark a diversion was staged and the garrison retreated to the second position, [...] making it back despite being fired on {{as they approached the}} position. IR 183 counter-attacked Quergraben III (Fourth Street) again at [...] but collided with the 111th and 112th Brigades of the 34th Division, co-operating with the 69th Brigade attack on Contalmaison. The 111th Brigade was forced back to Quergraben III with [...] having taken [...] and the 112th Brigade gave ground until a battalion made a bayonet counter-attack. The IR 183 report blamed fire on the left flank and rear, from the British who had got into Contalmaison, as the Germans reached the Roerdergraben and at [...] the regiment was ordered to retire to <b>Kabel</b> and Latorff trenches and hold Pozières at all costs.|$|E
2500|$|By dawn, IR 183 had {{completed}} a retirement to <b>Kabel</b> and Latorff trenches, having lost about [...] {{and in the}} centre, RIR 122 {{was back in the}} second position from Pozières to Bazentin le Petit behind a screen of machine-gun posts north of Mametz Wood and extending towards Contalmaison, having lost [...] in two days but IR Lehr was still holding Flat Iron Copse. By noon on 11 July, the 23rd Division was relieved by the 1st Division, having lost [...] up to 10 July. The German positions between Mametz Wood and Contalmaison, were captured by the 17th Division, after they were outflanked by the capture of the village and {{the southern part of the}} wood, although bombing attacks up trenches on 9 July had failed. At [...] a surprise bayonet charge was attempted by a battalion each from the 50th and 51st brigades, which reached part of Quadrangle Support Trench on the left but eventually failed with many casualties. After the capture of Contalmaison next day, an afternoon attack by part of the 51st Brigade advanced from the sunken road east of the village, to Quadrangle Support Trench. Parties of the 50th Brigade attacked westwards up Strip Trench and Wood Support Trench, against German defenders who fought hand-to-hand, at great cost to both sides, before the objective was captured. Touch was gained with the 38th Division in the wood and the 23rd Division in the village, before the 21st Division took over early on 11 July; the 17th Division had lost [...] since 1 July.|$|E
