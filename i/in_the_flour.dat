5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, Minneapolis began to lose its {{dominant}} position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flour</b> milling industry, after reaching its peak in 1915–1916. The rise of steam power, and later electric power, eroded the advantage that St. Anthony Falls provided in water power. The wheat fields of the Dakotas and Minnesota's Red River Valley began suffering from soil exhaustion due to consecutive wheat crops, leading {{to an increase in}} wheat leaf rust and related crop diseases. The farmers of the southern plains developed a variety of hardy red winter wheat suitable for bread flour, and the Kansas City area gained prominence in milling. Also, due to changes in rail shipping rates, millers in Buffalo, New York were able to ship their flour more competitively.|$|E

500|$|The St. Anthony Express {{newspaper}} {{predicted in}} 1855 that, [...] "The {{time is not}} distant when Minnesota, with the superiority of her soil and seasons for wheat culture, and her unparalleled water power for manufacturing flour, will export largely of this article. ... our mills will turn out wheat, superior in quality and appearance to any now manufactured in the West." [...] By 1876, eighteen flour mills had been built {{on the west side}} of the river below the falls. The first mills used traditional technology of millstones that would pulverize the grain and grind as much flour as possible in one pass. This system worked best for winter wheat, which was sown in the fall and resumed its growth in the spring. However, the harsh winter conditions of the upper Midwest did not lend themselves to the production of winter wheat, since the deep frosts and lack of snow cover killed the crop. Spring wheat, which could be sown in the spring and reaped in the summer, was a more dependable crop. However, conventional milling techniques did not produce a desirable product, since the harder husks of spring wheat kernels fractured between the grindstones. The gluten and starch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flour</b> could not be mixed completely, either, and the flour would turn rancid. Minneapolis milling companies solved this problem by inventing the middlings purifier, which made it possible to separate the husks from the flour earlier in the milling process. They also developed a gradual-reduction process, where grain was pulverized between a series of rollers made of porcelain, iron, or steel. This process resulted in [...] "patent" [...] flour, which commanded almost double the price of [...] "bakers" [...] or [...] "clear" [...] flour, which it replaced. The Washburn mill attempted to monopolize these techniques, but Pillsbury and other companies lured employees away from Washburn and were able to duplicate the process.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Yacon (Smallanthus sonchifolius) is a {{tuberous}} root from <b>the</b> Andean region <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South America rich em water, fructooligosaccharides and phenolic compounds, {{some of which}} are natural antioxidants and may help prevent the deleterious action of free radicals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body. The yacon has attracted much attention due to their potential health benefits to humans. <b>In</b> this study <b>the</b> levels of total phenolics, tannins, phenolic acids, and total antioxidant activity were measured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> peel and pulp of yacon tubers both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fresh and <b>flour</b> forms. <b>The</b> <b>flours</b> of yacon presented higher concentrations of total phenolics and tannins, especially peel <b>flour.</b> <b>The</b> yacon pulp <b>flour</b> stood out as the main source of phenolic acids, mainly caffeic and chlorogenic acid. The total antioxidant activity assessed by DPPH (2, 2 -Diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2, 2 ′-Azino-bis (3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid)) assays was higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> yacon peel <b>flour.</b> <b>The</b> total antioxidant activity was correlated with the total phenolic content and tannins by the DPPH and ABTS assays.

2500|$|Bread making {{began with}} the milling of the grain. It was a {{difficult}} and time-consuming task, performed by women. Each household stored its own grain, and {{it is estimated that}} it required at least three hours of daily effort to produce enough flour to make sufficient bread for a family of five. The earliest milling was performed with a pestle and mortar, or a stone quern consisting of a large lower stone that held the grain and a smooth upper stone that was moved {{back and forth over the}} grains (...) [...] This often left small pieces of grit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flour.</b> The use of the millstone became more widespread during the Iron Age, resulting in greater speed and increased production of flour. Smaller versions for household use, the rotary or beehive quern, appeared during the early Persian period.|$|E
2500|$|Adjacent sperm storage organs: [...] Females can {{sometimes}} store sperm in adjacent organs, {{especially when they}} mate multiply and thus give unequal preference to certain males. [...] In many polygamous species, males often {{have the ability to}} displace a previous male's sperm. [...] In response to this, females retain control of sperm choice by using multiple sperm storage sites to exercise cryptic female choice. [...] By moving sperm to adjacent organs females can prevent particular sperm from being displaced and save the displaced sperm for fertilization. Moving the sperm can also prevent it from continuing on in the fertilization process. [...] In the Dryomiza anilis fly and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flour</b> beetle, females choose sperm from [...] a number of different storage locations. In the red flour beetle, females often possess several storage receptacles for sperm from different males, and can choose which spem to utilize for fertilization.|$|E
