40|$|Previous {{literature}} {{demonstrates that}} <b>interlocking</b> <b>director</b> networks are significant in various financial areas. However, {{the distinction between}} network selection and behavioral influence effects is not considered. Few studies in the finance discipline have sufficiently considered social networks in a statistically robust way. This inattention may cause bias similar to omitted variable bias, resulting in incorrect conclusions being reached from the reported results. We employ recent advances in statistical modeling to investigate {{the effect of the}} <b>interlocking</b> <b>director</b> network on executive compensation, capital structure and mergers and acquisitions. Results show selection and influence effects are strongly significant. Firms select directors from firms with a similar proportion of fixed executive compensation (such as salary) and a similar level of acquisitiveness. Firms are influenced via the <b>interlocking</b> <b>director</b> network to become more similar with respect to executive compensation practices and capital structure choice, and more dissimilar for the number of acquisitions undertaken. That firms become more dissimilar in level of acquisitiveness may be attributed to negative feedback on acquiring because prior research shows that acquisitions are generally value destructive for the acquirer. The results suggest that the <b>interlocking</b> <b>director</b> network is a potent mechanism for the spread of firm practices. Common dependent variables from prior literature are less significant in explaining observed outcomes when the network is taken into account. For executive compensation, the profitability of a firm is no longer significant for the model including the <b>interlocking</b> <b>director</b> network but is significant when the same data are used in a standard linear regression. A similar occurrence happens for asset tangibility in the capital structure models. Tobin’s q and free cash flow are significant for the same data in a Poisson regression model for count data, and not significant for <b>interlocking</b> <b>director</b> network mergers and acquisitions models.

40|$|Research on the {{diffusion}} of strategic actions through board interlocks has mainly focused on the dyad level, meaning the one-on-one relations between a focal firm and its interlocked firm. The structural embeddedness of a firm and {{the characteristics of the}} <b>interlocking</b> <b>director</b> on {{the diffusion}} of strategic actions have received little scholarly attention. Drawing from a social network perspective, I first examine how duration of an interlock can influence {{the diffusion of}} strategic actions. In this dissertation, I specifically focus on mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in emerging markets as the strategic action of interest. Next, I turn to the theory of triads in structural sociology and examine the influence of a closed triad. I theorize that Simmelian ties formed in a closed triad facilitate diffusion. I then propose the influence of the number of cliques in which both the focal firm and its interlocked firm are embedded. I also theorize how a sending board?s influence can increase the diffusion of M&As in emerging markets, whereas a receiving board?s access to information can decrease the diffusion. Finally, I explore the influence of interlocking directors. I specifically focus on the influence of the interlocking director?s position on either board (as a chair), tenure on the receiving board, and ownership in the focal firm. I tested my hypotheses with public firms from 2001 to 2012 and limited the emerging markets to BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China). I found evidence in support of five of my hypotheses. My results show that the duration of an interlock, the number of cliques in which embedded by both firms, the sending board?s influence, and whether an <b>interlocking</b> <b>director</b> is a chair on either board are positively associated with the focal firm?s implementation of M&As in emerging markets following the interlocked firm; whereas the receiving board?s access to information predicted the opposite direction. I then discuss the implications, opportunities for future research, and limitations of my dissertation. My main theoretical contributions are to extend social network theory and to provide a multi-level theory of board interlocks and the diffusion of strategic actions...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs), or p* models, include new specifications that give {{a much better}} chance of model convergence for large networks compared with the traditional Markov models. Simulation based MCMC maximum likelihood estimation techniques have been developed to replace the pseudolikelihood method. To date most work on ERGMs has focused on one-mode networks, with little done in the case of affiliation networks with two or more types of nodes. This paper proposes ERGMs for two-mode affiliation networks drawing on the recent advances for one-mode networks, including new two-mode specifications. We investigate features of the models by simulation, and compared the goodness of fit results obtained using the maximum likelihood and pseudolikelihood approaches. We introduce a new approach to goodness of fit for network models, using a heuristic based on Mahalanobis distance. The classic Southern Women data and Australian <b>Interlocking</b> <b>Director</b> data are used as examples to show that the ERGM with the newly specified statistics is a powerful tool for statistical analysis of affiliation networks...|$|E

30|$|The next {{variable}} {{included in}} this component is the percentage of <b>interlocked</b> <b>directors.</b> Two directors are considered “interlocked” when one director is serving as {{a board member of}} the other director’s company. The close relationship between <b>interlocked</b> <b>directors</b> can impair board independence by mutually influencing each other’s choices for their personal advantage, thereby detracting from the boards’ monitoring role. Thus, a higher percentage of <b>interlocked</b> <b>directors</b> indicates poor corporate governance. This view is expressed by a number of corporate governance studies (Hallock 1997; Core et al. 1999; Larcker et al. 2005; Bizjak et al. 2009;, Dah and Frye 2017), along with regulators and professional bodies (the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association of Corporate Directors).|$|R
40|$|We {{examine whether}} board {{connections}} through shared directors influence firm disclosure policies. To overcome endogeneity challenges, {{we focus on}} an event that represents {{a significant change in}} firm disclosure policy: the cessation of quarterly earnings guidance. Our research design allows us to exploit the timing of <b>director</b> <b>interlocks</b> and therefore differentiate the <b>director</b> <b>interlock</b> effect on disclosure policy contagion from alternative explanations, such as endogenous director-firm matching or strategic board stacking. We find that firms are more likely to stop providing quarterly earnings guidance if they share directors with previous guidance stoppers. We also find that director-specific experience from prior guidance cessations matters for disclosure policy contagion. The positive effect of <b>interlocked</b> <b>directors</b> on the likelihood of quarterly earnings guidance cessation is particularly strong for firms with <b>interlocked</b> <b>directors</b> who experienced positive outcomes from prior guidance cessation decisions. Overall, our evidence is consistent with <b>interlocked</b> <b>directors</b> serving as conduits for information sharing that leads to the spread of corporate disclosure policies...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore whether {{interlock}} ties between the board of directors and the external auditors facilitate the cross-firm diffusion of voluntary disclosures in annual reports. Design/methodology/approach – Using a sample of 149 non-financial companies publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Euronext Amsterdam, we use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis to examine the relationships between the incidence of financial and non-financial voluntary disclosures in the focal firms’ annual reports and the annual reports of other companies to which the firms are related via the interlock ties of its board members and external auditor. Findings – The results show significant associations between financial and non-financial voluntary disclosures in the focal and related firms’ annual reports when there were board interlocks. Differences in the diffusion of specific types of disclosures are found depending on the type of <b>interlocking</b> <b>director.</b> The results also show that interlock ties of the external auditors positively influence the associations with voluntary financial disclosures in the annual reports. Practical implications – We find clear indications that board and auditor interlocks form important sources of inter-organisational information exchange that can drive changes in voluntary disclosure practices in annual reports. The networks of social relationships between firms may play a significant incremental role in the cross-firm diffusion of corporate voluntary disclosure practices, particularly in complex and ambiguous situations. Originality/value – This paper is the first empirical study to investigate how board and external auditor interlock ties are related to the levels of financial and non-financial voluntary disclosures in the focal and related firms’ annual reports...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} phenomenon of stigma by association between firms {{in the context of}} corporate accounting scandals. I draw from the social psychology literature to develop a theoretical framework that supports the notion of director interlocks as a channel in which associated firms may experience stigma. I argue that allegations of corporate accounting scandal generate attributional search by investors to determine the cause(s) of the alleged scandal. Attribution theory suggests that investors are likely to attribute responsibility to corporate boards for failing to detect and prevent these scandals. Investors?????? perceptions of incompetent and/or unwilling directors in firms accused of accounting scandals may then spill over to directorship positions in associated firms, resulting in the stigmatization of these associated firms. The results strongly support the above arguments. I further adopted an information-based approach to argue that firms associated with stigmatized firms will experience different amounts of stigma, and some firms may experience no stigma at all. I applied social inference theories and agency theory to develop four categories of variables that may influence the amount of stigma experienced by associated firms. The results of the dissertation present strong evidence in support of most of the hypotheses. The characteristics of the <b>interlocking</b> <b>director,</b> the characteristics of the board, the strength of the director interlock, and the quality of corporate governance in an associated firm appear to influence the amount of stigma experienced by the associated firm. This dissertation highlights the possible (1) negative consequences of director interlocks, (2) understatement of the social costs of corporate accounting scandals, and (3) need for response strategies to mitigate the negative consequences of stigma by association...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on three {{empirical}} studies of the <b>director</b> <b>interlock</b> network among Swedish firms listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange, focusing on its consequences for firm behavior and its association with ownership structures. <b>Director</b> <b>interlocks</b> are created when directors serve on, and hence <b>interlock,</b> several boards. <b>Director</b> <b>interlocks</b> aggregate to a social network that not only connects most firms into a single component, but are, more essentially, also shown to affect firm behavior. The introductory chapter contains {{a review of the}} <b>director</b> <b>interlock</b> research as well as some suggestions for future research directions. Study I is an examination of the importance of <b>director</b> <b>interlock</b> relations for stock repurchases. Using parametric survival analysis, it is demonstrated that the decision to repurchase stocks is dependent on both the firms’ economic settings and their <b>director</b> <b>interlocks.</b> Study II examines the network impact on recruitment of new board members in the network of firms, directors, and owners. Using simulations, it is shown that directors with personal contact with a director and/or owner of the recruiting firm have a substantially increased probability of being recruited to the focal board. Study III examines the association between ownership and <b>director</b> <b>interlocks.</b> Re-analyses of the same network examined in Study II show that multiple director assignments are highly dependent on ownership interlocks. The three studies exemplify the real-world consequences of board interlocks and field a new understanding of the mechanisms behind their formation. Furthermore, the association between the <b>director</b> and ownership <b>interlocks</b> suggests that the ownership network (co-) produces some of the phenomena that have been attributed to the director network.

40|$|In {{the early}} part of this century, Enron, Parmalat, World. Com are some of the more high profile {{corporate}} collapses and cases of audit failure. Changes to policy settings and the regulation of auditor independence are seen as a key outcome of these events. Across the world, members of the accounting profession and regulators alike have professed that the issues emerging from these incidents have been dealt with. In particular, the permitting of strong economic bonds between the audit client and the auditor, as occurred with several audit failures, are a thing of the past. This paper challenges a crucial aspect of this assertion. Using data from the population of Australian stock exchange listed companies; we provide evidence that the initial appointment of an audit supplier is significantly affected by pre-existing relationships with that supplier. These pre-existing relationships provide the context for a potentially powerful economic bond between auditors and clients. Where a director sits on more than one board, these boards can be thought of as 'interlocked'. When a decision to change auditors has been made, the presence of <b>interlocked</b> <b>directors</b> is highly significant in explaining the choice of the new audit firm. Anecdotally individual directors may know that they or others have had influence over auditor choice. However, we believe that that this is the first time that this effect has been demonstrated to exist systematically across a population of companies. We characterise this interlocking as a 'club' where the presence of directors who sit on multiple boards significantly affect the decisions over auditor choice. This suggests that audit firms outside the 'club' may have a difficult time in joining the 'club' unless they can find a 'sponsoring' <b>interlocked</b> <b>director.</b> While having <b>interlocked</b> company directorates offers many benefits, they do set up a potentially powerful economic bond between audit firms and the 'interlocked' audit clients. This has the potential to undermine auditor independence in appearance [...] essential for market confidence [...] as well as in fact. For example, where an auditor has adverse findings in respect of an audit which are not received well by the client company and its board, the potential ultimate consequence for the auditor is not just the loss of one client but of all of the director-interlocked clients. An interesting further result is that certain <b>interlocked</b> <b>directors</b> appear to be particularly influential. There are potential public policy implications for this result. The benefit to individual companies of having <b>interlocked</b> <b>directors</b> needs to be balanced with the public interest of not having potentially significant economic bonds between auditors and clients...|$|R

One of the central concerns of such studies is the nature of financial rewards for former public officials after leaving public service. This paper considers one critical aspect of post-career earnings: membership of corporate boards among former politicians and civil servants in Britain. It addresses three questions: who obtain post-career rewards in the corporate world after time in high public office, how well connected and remunerated are they in the network of <b>interlocking</b> <b>directors,</b> and do these former politicians and bureaucrats together constitute a distinct political class within the corporate network? The analysis uses data on corporate rewards in Britain for more than 700 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange and information on over 7500 directors and 1000 former high public officials. The results from network analysis of <b>interlocking</b> <b>directors</b> on corporate boards suggest that members of the political class are better connected in this elite network, but receive significantly lower compensations, even when controlling for industry sector, experience and board role. While social class and educational backgrounds are known to be important in sociological analyses of corporate networks, the influence of time in public office has not yet been considered; by filling that gap, this paper offers novel insight into interconnectedness of the public sphere and the corporate world...|$|R
40|$|Research Question/Issue: This study {{investigates the}} {{association}} between {{the composition of the}} board of directors and corporate diversification, to explore the role of the board in corporate strategic choice. Research Findings/Insights: Based on a sample of 101 Australian publicly listed firms in 2005, this study finds that there is no link between corporate decisions on product and/or geographic diversification and two aspects of board composition: board independence and institutional representation. However, there is a positive link between total diversification and a third aspect of board composition: the proportion of directors who have ties to boards of corporations in other industries. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The results provide support for managerial hegemony theory, and resource dependency theory. Corporate strategic decisions regarding diversification are more likely to be made by management than boards of directors, and to be encouraged by <b>interlocking</b> <b>directors</b> with extraindustry ties. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Contrary to the requirement or recommendation in many jurisdictions that boards be more independent, these results indicate that shareholders' interests, represented by lower levels of diversification, are not promoted under such circumstances. <b>Interlocking</b> <b>directors</b> appear to effectively link the corporation to the external business environment and to encourage diversification.

For an arbitrary pair of corporations in this component the median path length was 3. Levin and Roy tested the graph for cut points and failed to find any with their search starting with corporations with large boards.|$|R

In earlier research we have found a correlation between political participation and political trust of ethnic minorities on the one hand and the network of ethnic associations on the other. (Fennema/Tillie, 1999) In this paper we treat the network of ethnic organizations a proxy for civic community. It is a long established assumption that voluntary associations create social trust, which, in turn can spill over into political trust. But if voluntary associations generate trust why would interlocking directorates among such organizations add to it? Our answer is that trust can travel trough a network of interlocking directorates and by doing so increase. Civic community building is the creation of trust among organizations. Bottom up, increased social trust may generate political trust because the citizens feel that their leaders are competent to monitor local government. The rank and file sees their leaders as their agents. Top down, <b>interlocking</b> <b>directors</b> can spread the political trust they themselves have within the ethnic community. By doing so, they act as an agent for the local government. In both cases the <b>interlocking</b> <b>directors</b> have an important broker function. Finally we discuss whether this civic community is generated by factors that stem from the political opportunity structure in the host country or whether more weight should be given to those cultural factors that originate in the country of origin. “The role of social trust and cooperativeness as a component of civic culture cannot be overemphasized. It is, in a sense, a generalized resource that keeps a democratic polity operating. ” Gabriel A. Almond and Sidney Verba, 1965 : 35...|$|R
