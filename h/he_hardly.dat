5|$|Breeding {{takes place}} in May and June, and {{fighting}} among females for a mate is common. Females can mate several times and lay several clutches of eggs in one season. The male does the incubation; during this process <b>he</b> <b>hardly</b> eats or drinks and loses {{a significant amount of}} weight. The eggs hatch after around eight weeks, and the young are nurtured by their fathers. They reach full size after around six months, but can remain as a family unit until the next breeding season. The emu is an important cultural icon of Australia, appearing on the coat of arms and various coins. The bird features prominently in Indigenous Australian mythology.|$|E
25|$|Akhbar S. Ahmed {{concluded}} that Al-Biruni {{can be considered}} as the first Anthropologist, however, others argue that <b>he</b> <b>hardly</b> can be considered an anthropologist in the conventional sense.|$|E
25|$|Bates {{was born}} in Kirkheaton, Yorkshire, England. He played 113 games for his native county between 1907 and 1913, scoring 2,634 runs at 17.32 with a highest score of 81. Although he {{developed}} into a fine left arm orthodox spinner, <b>he</b> <b>hardly</b> bowled before World War I, taking two wickets for Yorkshire.|$|E

25|$|Sadequain painted {{thousands}} of paintings, drawings, and murals in his lifetime. <b>He</b> <b>hardly</b> ever sold {{his work and}} mostly gave it away; sometimes his work was simply taken, and sometime even stolen. In his lifetime there were two galleries named after him by the authorities, but they no longer exist.|$|E
25|$|In October 2005, his {{daughter}} Amelie was born. Harald Schmidt resides in Cologne {{with his partner}} Ellen Hantsch, a school teacher, and five children, the eldest being from a former relationship. Little {{is known about the}} children and their two mothers as Schmidt shields them from the public. In interviews <b>he</b> <b>hardly</b> talks about them.|$|E
25|$|Du Qiong {{was known}} for being a man of few words and for {{maintaining}} a low profile throughout his career. <b>He</b> <b>hardly</b> interacted with his colleagues outside the workplace and stayed in his residence {{most of the time}} during non-working hours. Jiang Wan and Fei Yi, who consecutively served as the heads of the Shu central government between 234 and 253, respected and regarded him highly.|$|E

25|$|Forman died of {{dementia}} related issues on 11 May 2017. In {{the last year}} of his life he was reported to have been dismayed by the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum and to have stated that the UK had become a country <b>he</b> <b>hardly</b> knew. However, obituarists drew attention to his comment (quoted above) published thirty years earlier concerning the tendency of the Conservative party to be occasionally swept along in particular ideologies.|$|E
25|$|In the novella, {{the husband}} long {{suspected}} that his patient (Marion) was infatuated with him, {{while in the}} film it is a complete surprise and he seems shocked. He is also more overwhelmed by the orgy in the film than in the novella. Fridolin is socially bolder but less sexual with the prostitute (Mizzi in the novella, Domino in the film). Fridolin is also conscious of looking old in the novella, though <b>he</b> <b>hardly</b> does in the film.|$|E
25|$|During 1983 Wolfgang Flür was {{beginning}} to spend less time in the studio. Since the band began using sequencers {{his role as a}} drummer was becoming less frequent. He preferred to spend his time travelling with his girlfriend. Flür was also experiencing artistic difficulties with the band. After his final work on the 1986 album Electric Café (a.k.a. Techno Pop) <b>he</b> <b>hardly</b> returned to the Kling Klang Studio. In 1987 he left the band and was replaced by Fritz Hilpert.|$|E

25|$|Nagao {{resigned}} as front member on New Year's Eve in 2000, {{and concentrated on}} composition thereafter. After that, Nagao appeared {{in front of their}} fans as a member only twice more—the performance of the third debut anniversary held in September 2002, and a guest appearance in the second encore of their last live concert held on November 25, 2005. Nagao decided to work behind the scenes as he was unable to manage both the production of music and the live performance and promotional campaign. Nagao only wrote songs after he stopped appearing in public, and <b>he</b> <b>hardly</b> participated in recording.|$|E
25|$|After {{defeating}} John Pulman in two close {{finals in}} 1955 and 1956, Davis {{chose not to}} play in the 1957 Championship—held in Jersey and, for financial reasons, featuring just four entrants—thus leaving the path clear for his rival Pulman. After the war Davis and his wife had invested in a hotel in Llandudno, and this gave them some financial security away from snooker. This proved a wise move; by the early 1960s Davis was playing exhibitions in aid of cancer charities, but soon even this limited amount of snooker activity dried up. Following tours of Canada and Australia (where he won an international tournament in 1960) and after an exhibition in Pontefract where he performed in front {{of only a handful of}} people, Davis effectively went into retirement. <b>He</b> <b>hardly</b> played for four seasons before being contacted by Rex Williams, who was keen to restart interest in snooker.|$|E
25|$|However, from 1901 Townsend began devoting most of {{the summer}} to {{studying}} law and later practising as a solicitor. This meant that he could only play a handful of matches each season until 1906. Though <b>he</b> <b>hardly</b> bowled at all in these games, his batting continued to find success. He scored 147 on a fairly difficult pitch against Sussex in 1902, and 214 against Worcestershire in 1906. From 1907 he was appointed as Official Receiver at Stockton-on-Tees and could play only exceptionally rarely (though he would have played in the Cheltenham festival in 1908 but for a strain). Innings of 61 against a formidable Yorkshire attack in his only appearance for 1907, 126 against the Australians in 1909 and 84 (after Gloucestershire at been dismissed for a record low 22 in their first innings) to beat Somerset in 1920 followed. His last appearances in 1921 and 1922 yielded little success, and Townsend was never involved in the game after that.|$|E

500|$|The {{brothers}} were parted in 1883; George {{continued in the}} navy and Albert Victor attended Trinity College, Cambridge. At Bachelor's Cottage, Sandringham, Albert Victor was expected to cram before arriving at university {{in the company of}} Dalton, French instructor Monsieur Hua, and a newly chosen tutor/companion James Kenneth Stephen. Some biographers have said that Stephen was a misogynist, although this has recently been questioned, and he may have felt emotionally attached to Albert Victor, but whether or not his feelings were overtly homosexual is open to question. Stephen was initially optimistic about tutoring the prince, {{but by the time the}} party were to move to Cambridge had concluded, [...] "I do not think he can possibly derive much benefit from attending lectures at Cambridge... <b>He</b> <b>hardly</b> knows the meaning of the words to read".|$|E
500|$|During {{the period}} between his junior and senior years, {{he played in the}} Cape Cod League, {{finishing}} sixth in the league in batting average. In his senior year in 2001 he repeated as second-team All-American. He set UC career records for home runs (56), walks (206), slugging percentage (.627), and on-base percentage (.499) with a batting average of [...]366. [...] "He had a great eye ... <b>he</b> <b>hardly</b> ever struck out looking", said Brad Meador, UC's associate head coach. [...] "When he did, you knew the ump missed the call." [...] Cleary, noting how driven Youkilis was to succeed, told his father: [...] "Your son's going to be a millionaire some day. I don't know if it's in baseball, but he's going to make some money one of these days." [...] Youkilis was later inducted into UC's James Kelly Athletics Hall of Fame.|$|E
500|$|Hand's {{democratic}} {{respect for}} legislation meant that <b>he</b> <b>hardly</b> ever {{struck down a}} law. Whenever his decisions went against the government, he based them only on the boundaries of law in particular cases. He adhered to the doctrine of presumptive validity, which assumes that legislators {{know what they are}} doing when they pass a law. Even when a law was uncongenial to him, or when it seemed contradictory, Hand set himself to interpret the legislative intent. Sometimes, however, he was obliged to draw the line between federal and state laws, as in United States v. Schechter Poultry. In this important case, he ruled that a New Deal law on working conditions did not apply to a New York poultry firm that conducted its business only within the state. Hand wrote in his opinion: [...] "It is always a serious thing to declare any act of Congress unconstitutional, and especially in a case where {{it is part of a}} comprehensive plan for the rehabilitation of the nation as a whole. With the wisdom of that plan we have nothing whatever to do..." ...|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Stan now has 845,323 friends (almost {{all of whom}} <b>he</b> <b>hardly</b> knows or {{does not}} know) on his account and has finally decided to delete it, {{only to find that}} Facebook refuses to allow him to. Instead of {{deleting}} his account, Stan is forcibly transported by the software into the virtual world of Facebook, where he meets [...] "profiles" [...] of everyone he knows who communicate in Facebook lingo, and is forced to engage in Facebook activities such as Yahtzee. Unexpectedly winning on the first roll, Stan escapes and finds his way to Kyle's Farm Town farm, blaming Kyle for getting him [...] "sucked into Facebook" [...] in the first place. Stan orders Kyle to check out his profile status and Kyle finds out that Stan is supposedly hosting a party elsewhere in Facebook at Café World. Kyle makes it to Stan's party, only to find that Isiah has refused to be his friend because of Kip. Desperate to retain some friends, Kyle finally deletes Kip, leaving him with no friends. Kip, too, is disheartened to find his friend has abandoned him.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, he {{appeared}} in the independent crime drama Winged Creatures (released as Fragments on DVD) alongside Dakota Fanning as they portrayed two teenage friends who survive a massacre, and in Journey to the Center of the Earth, a 3D film adaptation of the novel {{of the same name}} where he portrayed a teen who travels to Iceland with an uncle <b>he</b> <b>hardly</b> knows, played by Brendan Fraser. Over the next two years, {{he appeared}} as a boy named Steve [...] "Leopard" [...] Leonard who visits a freak show with his friends in the vampire fiction [...] of the book Cirque du Freak and had a supporting role in the critically acclaimed The Kids Are All Right, portraying the son of a lesbian couple, played by Annette Bening and Julianne Moore. According to Kaleem Aftab of The Independent, his role in the film was a pivotal point in his career and one of vital importance to continuing his career into adulthood. Hutcherson expressed gratitude at being cast in the film, displaying satisfaction with the intimacy and creative freedom that independent films provide over studio films. The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture– Musical or Comedy in 2010, and was a nominee for Best Picture at the 83rd Academy Awards. Gregory Ellwood of entertainment site HitFix stated: [...] "Hutcherson's charismatic wit and natural instincts shine and it's arguably the first film where he proves he's more than just another sharp-looking teen actor." ...|$|E
500|$|Brian Donlevy as Professor Bernard Quatermass: Donlevy reprised {{his role}} as the eponymous professor, much to the despair of Nigel Kneale, who had heavily criticised his {{interpretation}} of the role in The Quatermass Xperiment. As had been the case on The Quatermass Xperiment, Donlevy's alcoholism presented challenges for the production. Nigel Kneale recalled visiting the set one day: “He [...] was so full of whiskey he could hardly stand up. He staggered over to the set and looked dazedly around. They held up an idiot board with his lines on and he said, “What's this movie called?” and they said, “Well, it's called Quatermass 2”. He said, “I've got to say all that? There's too much talk. Cut down some of the talk”. He tried to read it and he had to have go after go after go, so crippled with drink <b>he</b> <b>hardly</b> knew who he was”. Val Guest has denied Kneale's claims, saying “So many stories have been concocted since, about how he was a paralytic. It's absolute balls, because he was not paralytic. He wasn't stone cold sober either, but he was a pro and he knew his lines”. Guest also recalled, “By after lunch he would come to me and say “Give me a breakdown of the story so far. Where have I just been before this scene?” We used to feed him black coffee all morning but then we discovered he was lacing it. But he was a very professional actor and very easy to work with”.|$|E
