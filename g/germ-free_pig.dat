40|$|Numerous {{bacteria}} are found, in the intestines of ordinary experimental animals. In {{the study of}} the effects on animals of initial monoinfection with a single strain of organisms or cross-infection with different kinds of organisms, it is hardly possible to get absolutely accurate results if these organisms were tried on conventionally reared animals. This problem can only be solved by using animals born and reared in a germless atmosphere, since they are free from the intestinal flora which constitutes an important obstacle. Experiments were carried out in <b>germ-free</b> guinea <b>pigs</b> raised for 20 days in HMC- 2 type germless rearing apparatus after having been taken unborn from the mother 2 ̆ 7 s womb, in order to study the effects of monoinfection or cross-infection with Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli M_ 1 separated from the feces of parent females. Following oral administration of the organisms to baby <b>germ-free</b> guinea <b>pigs,</b> organisms detected in their feces were counted every day. Twenty days after the administration, the animals were killed, and the organisms detected among the intestinal villi were counted. Investigations were performed on the kinds of organisms detected in the intestines, and in vitro experiments were carried out to study how different kinds of organisms reacted when they were thrown into each other 2 ̆ 7 s company. The results are summarized as follows : 1. It proved fairly difficult to detect L. acidophilus in the feces and intestines of conventionally reared guinea pigs. 2. Once lodged in the intestines of the <b>germ-free</b> guinea <b>pigs,</b> L. acidophilus continued to multiply, though slowly. 3. Oral administration of L. acidophilus and Str. faecalis to <b>germ-free</b> guinea <b>pigs</b> caused transient intestinal hypersensitisvity. There was a slight diarrhea. 4.

40|$|Abstract. Campylobacter jejuni, {{a leading}} cause of {{bacterial}} gastroenteritis, has different age distribution and disease expression in developing and developed countries, which {{may be due to the}} endemnicity of infection and the age of acquisition of immunity. Differences in disease expression are not solely dependent on the C. jejuni strain or virulence attributes. Another modulating factor in developing countries may be endemic nematode infections such as Trichuris, which drive type 2 cytokine responses and down-regulate type 1 immune responses. In this study, three-day-old <b>germ-free</b> <b>pigs</b> given dual infections with Trichuris suis and C. jejuni had more frequent, more severe diarrhea and severe pathology than pigs given no pathogens, only T. suis, or only C. jejuni. These pigs had significant hemorrhage and inflammatory cell infiltrates in the proximal colon where adult worms were found, and abscessed lymphoglandular complexes in the distal colon with intracellular C. jejuni. Pigs given only C. jejuni had mild clinical signs and pathology, and bacteria in feces or extracellular sites. Pigs given T. suis or no pathogens had no disease and minimal pathology.

In this study, we isolated and characterized progenitor epithelial cells from the bone marrow of 4 - to 5 -week old <b>germ-free</b> <b>pigs.</b> Microscopically, the cultured cells showed epithelial-like morphology. Phenotypically, these cells expressed the stem cell markers octamer-binding transcription factor (Oct 4) and stage-specific embryonic antigen- 1 (SSEA- 1), the alveolar stem cell marker Clara cell secretory protein (Ccsp), and the epithelial cell markers pan-cytokeratin (Pan-K), cytokeratin- 18 (K- 18), and occludin. When cultured in epithelial cell growth medium, the progenitor epithelial cells expressed type I and type II pneumocyte markers. Next, we examined the susceptibility of these cells to influenza virus. Progenitor epithelial cells expressed sialic acid receptors utilized by avian and mammalian influenza viruses and were targets for influenza virus replication. Additionally, differentiated type II but not type I pneumocytes supported the replication of influenza virus. Our data indicate that we have identified a unique population of progenitor epithelial cells in the bone marrow that might have airway reconstitution potential and may be a useful model for cell-based therapies for infectious and non-infectious lung diseases...|$|R

A continuous PP {{is located in the}} terminal ileum (ileal PP). The length of both jejPP and ileal PP increased with age due to the increase in follicle size and in the number of follicles in the ileal PP. In older pigs, only the ileal PP regressed to small scattered follicles. In germ-free piglets at 39 and 59 days of age, longer PP were found than in normal new-born piglets, but they were significantly shorter than in age-matched controls. Lymphocyte production was studied by the metaphase-arrest technique using vincristine. Lymphocyte production in follicles increased dramatically with age, while in other compartments, such as the inter-follicular and dome area, a low age-independent production of lymphocytes was found. There were no differences in lymphocytopoiesis between jejPP and ileal PP.

40|$|Porcine circovirus (PCV) is {{a member}} of the genus Circovirus of the Circoviridae family. This family {{consists}} of a diverse group of animal viruses that possess a small, closed circular, single-stranded DNA genome that replicates through double-stranded intermediates. Two genotypes of PCV have been identified. PCV type 1 (PCV 1) is non-pathogenic, while PCV type 2 (PCV 2) has been implicated as the etiological agent of a collection of disease syndromes labeled porcine circovirus associated disease (PCVAD) which include postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in swine.;In late 2005, a postweaning, high mortality syndrome spread rapidly through fattening barns in swine dense areas of the United States. Diagnostic investigations consistently isolated porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2) from diseased tissues. Subsequent genetic analysis revealed the infectious agent was PCV 2 b. Prior to late 2004, only PCV 2 a, but not PCV 2 b, had been reported in North America. In the first manuscript in this thesis, we demonstrate an acute high mortality disease in <b>germ-free</b> <b>pigs</b> using infectious viruses generated from DNA clones constructed from PCV 2 a and PCV 2 b isolates identified in the 2005 outbreak. Clinical signs exhibited by diseased pigs included anorexia, dyspnea and listlessness. Mortality was typically observed within 12 hours of onset of dyspnea. The most striking microscopic lesions in affected animals were severe hepatic necrosis and depletion of germinal centers in lymph nodes with associated abundant PCV 2 viral antigen. Clinical signs and lesions observed in this study were comparable to those reported in experiments with <b>germ-free</b> <b>pigs</b> inoculated with a PCV 2 a isolate while concurrently receiving immune-stimulation or co-infection with porcine parvovirus. The animals in this study were confirmed to be free of detectable porcine parvovirus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine hepatitis E virus, and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Thus, in these studies, both PCV 2 a and PCV 2 b isolates were singularly capable of inducing high mortality in the absence of any recognized infectious co-factor in the gnotobiotic model.;Porcine circovirus associated disease is a disease complex affecting swine around the world. Although PCV 2 is believed to negatively affect the host 2 ̆ 7 s immune system, the mechanism by which PCV 2 induces disease is not completely understood. The second manuscript in this thesis describes a series of PCV 2 experiments using the gnotobiotic pig model in which a correlation was noted between abnormal leukograms and clinical disease in PCV 2 -infected pigs. The leukogram was characterized by a lymphopenia beginning within 14 days post inoculation (dpi) followed by an absolute neutrophilia approximately one week later. No significant changes in the circulating monocyte, basophil, and eosinophil cell populations were detected. The combination of an absolute neutrophilia and lymphopenia produced a neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio that was predictive of clinical disease and was inversely correlated with the presence of neutralizing antibodies...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{establish}} a human gut microbiota (HGM) transplanted gnotobiotic (Gn) pig model of human rotavirus (HRV) infection and diarrhea, and to verify the dose-effects of probiotics on HRV vaccine-induced immune responses. Our previous studies using the Gn pig model found that probiotics dose-dependently regulated both T cell and B cell immune responses induced by rotavirus vaccines. We generated the HGM transplanted neonatal Gn pigs through daily feeding of neonatal human fecal suspension to <b>germ-free</b> <b>pigs</b> for 3 days starting at 12 hours after birth. We found that attenuated HRV (AttHRV) vaccination conferred similar overall protection against rotavirus diarrhea and virus shedding in Gn pigs and HGM transplanted Gn pigs. HGM promoted {{the development of the}} neonatal immune system, as evidenced by the significantly enhanced IFN-c producing T cell responses and reduction of regulatory T cells and their cytokine production in the AttHRV-vaccinated pigs. The higher dose Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) feeding (14 doses, up to 109 colony-forming-unit [CFU]/dose) effectively increased the LGG counts in the HGM Gn pig intestinal contents and significantly enhanced HRV-specific IFN-c producing T cell responses to the AttHRV vaccine. Lower dose LGG (9 doses, up to 106 CFU/ dose) was ineffective. Neither doses of LGG significantly improved the protection rate, HRV-specific IgA and IgG antibody titers in serum, or IgA antibody titers in intestinal contents compared to the AttHRV vaccine alone, suggesting that an even higher dose of LGG is needed to overcome the influence of the microbiota to achieve the immunostimulatory effect in th...|$|R

40|$|Porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD) is {{considered}} a multifactorial disease since a variety of co-factors, including other infectious agents, seem to be necessary for full expression of clinical disease. To investigate if infection with ruminant pestiviruses is a co-factor in PCVAD, two experimental studies were conducted in pigs. In the first, two partially characterized virus preparations were inoculated into <b>germ-free</b> <b>pigs</b> either alone or with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2) group 2. These inocula were filtered tissue homogenates from diseased pigs known to contain either PCV 2 group 1 (PCV 2 - 1) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) type 1 -like virus, or BVDV type 1 -like virus only without PCV 2. A vaccination protocol against BVDV was tested as a possible measure to prevent development of clinical disease. One vaccinated, dually inoculated pig had acute respiratory distress followed by death at 21 days post infection. Lesions in this pig resembled the severe form of PCVAD recently observed in the field, suggesting a role of ruminant pestiviruses and/or vaccination {{in the development of}} this disease. In the second study, cesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived pigs were inoculated with PCV 2 - 1 and a cytopathic strain of BVDV type 1 (cpBVDV-NADL) either alone or in combination. Clinical signs of PCVAD were seen in a single animal inoculated only with PCV 2 - 1. This pig had growth retardation followed by acute respiratory distress and death 30 days post infection. Pulmonary lesions in this animal were similar to those seen in the pig that died in the first study. Infection with cpBVDV-NADL did not enhance PCV 2 - 1 replication and lesion formation. This supports the theory that emergence of PCV 2 - 1 in North America accounts for the change in the presentation of the disease seen since the fall of 2004. ^ The two pigs that died in these studies had multisystemic necrotizing vasculitis, one of the hallmark lesions of the severe form of PCVAD. Five additional pigs inoculated with PCV 2 - 1 in the second study developed lymphohistiocytic and plasmacytic peri- and endarteritis. The pigs with acute vasculitis had abundant intralesional circoviral nucleic acid, and absent or low antibody titers to PCV 2. In contrast, the pigs with lymphohistiocytic and plasmacytic vasculitis had circoviral nucleic acid in only rare non-affected vessels, and a high antibody titer against this virus. This suggests that the acute vasculitis is directly caused by the virus, whereas the chronic vasculitis is in part mediated by the immune response. The vascular alterations in pigs infected with PCV 2 seemed to be dependent on host factors and on the group of the virus. ...|$|R
