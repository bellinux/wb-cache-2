30|$|In {{the case}} of {{magnetic}} nanoparticles with non-zero surface charges migrating through the ground, a basic model of interaction between nanoparticles described by the probability of collision due to Brownian motion, velocity gradient, and sedimentation is insufficient. In our previous work, we derived the level <b>of</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>repulsive</b> electrostatic <b>forces</b> between the nanoparticles, and we assessed the level <b>of</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the attractive magnetic forces between magnetic nanoparticles. In this paper, we summarised the findings and included it into an analytical model of collisions between magnetic nanoparticles. Due to attractive magnetic forces, the rate of aggregation is significantly higher, whereas the <b>repulsive</b> electrostatic <b>forces</b> are almost negligible. One can suppose that with other realistic selections of values of magnetization vector or surface charge, this trend would not change dramatically. This modified model of aggregation can better explain the rapid aggregation of zero-valent iron nanoparticles that is observed. This can help with the simulation of the migration of undissolved particles in groundwater.|$|R

The pressure is calculated using the ring-integral approximation, and quantitative estimates of higher correction terms are given. The <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> short-range <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> is shown {{by comparing the results}} with two kinds of potential functions: hard spheres of diameter a, and "soft" spheres for which the short-range potential cancels the Coulomb potential at the origin, and decreases exponentially with distance. It is found that the use of either type of potential extends the range of validity of the ring integral approximation to considerably higher densities and lower temperatures. Since there is little difference in the results for the hard spheres and the soft spheres in this range, the latter is investigated more extensively since it is more easily handled by analytical methods. The expressions derived for the free energy of a system of charged particles can also be used in ionization equilibrium calculations, and the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> electrostatic interactions on the equilibrium concentrations of various kinds of ions is indicated...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{analyze the}} <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> charge in compact stars {{considering}} {{the limit of}} {{the maximum amount of}} charge they can hold. We find that the global balance of the forces allows a huge charge (~ 10 (20) Coulomb) to be present in a neutron star producing a very high electric field (~ 10 (21) V/m). We have studied the particular case of a polytropic equation of state and assumed that the charge distribution is proportional to the mass density. The charged stars have large mass and radius as we should expect due to the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the <b>repulsive</b> Coulomb <b>force</b> with the M/R ratio increasing with charge. In the limit of the maximum charge the mass goes up to ~ 10 which is much higher than the maximum mass allowed for a neutral compact star. However, the local <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the forces experienced by a single charged particle, makes it to discharge quickly. This creates a global force imbalance and the system collapses to a charged black hole...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic particle-scale {{numerical}} simulations {{are used}} {{to show that the}} shear thickening observed in dense colloidal, or Brownian, suspensions is of a similar nature to that observed in non-colloidal suspensions, i. e., a stress-induced transition from a flow of lubricated near-contacting particles to a flow of a frictionally contacting network of particles. Abrupt (or discontinuous) shear thickening is found to be a geometric rather than hydrodynamic phenomenon; it stems from the strong sensitivity of the jamming volume fraction to the nature of contact forces between suspended particles. The thickening obtained in a colloidal suspension of purely hard frictional spheres is qualitatively similar to experimental observations. However, the agreement cannot be made quantitative with only hydrodynamics, frictional contacts and Brownian forces. Therefore the role <b>of</b> a short-range <b>repulsive</b> potential mimicking the stabilization of actual suspensions on the thickening is studied. The <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> Brownian and <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> on the onset stress can be combined in an additive manner. The simulations including Brownian and stabilizing forces show excellent agreement with experimental data for the viscosity η and the second normal stress difference N_ 2.

40|$|The {{ability of}} a variety of {{nanofiltration}} and reverse osmosis membranes to retain the natural hormone estrone are examined here as a function of solution conditions. While size exclusion dominates retention with the tighter membranes, both size exclusion and adsorptive effects appear to be instrumental in maintaining high retention on nanofiltration membranes that otherwise exhibit relatively low ion retentions. These adsorptive effects may be driven by hydrogen bonding between estrone and the membrane. Electrostatic attraction appears to aid retention with an apparent slight decrease in retention at high NaCl concentrations. Deprotonation of estrone leads to a significant decrease in retention, most likely as a result <b>of</b> the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> strong electrostatic <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> decreasing the proximity of the negatively charged estrone to the negatively charged membrane surface and thus lowering the potential for adsorptive retention. This deprotonation effect is absent for tight RO membranes. The results reported here indicate that while open nanofiltration membranes may be effective in retaining estrone under some conditions, the extent of retention may be very susceptible to maintenance of adsorptive capacity at the membrane surface and depend on solution chemistry...|$|R

Given the {{enormous}} electrical potential that would develop with no screening, we conjecture that the size of the Universe,as given by the speed of light c and its age t, ct, cannot be very much lower than the Debye length. The Debye length of the Universe must be of the order of its size ct. It turns out that it is about 6 times larger. Hence inside the volume of size ct there is an outward electrical pressure {{due to the lack of}} complete screening of the electrical charges. We suggest that these charges are related to the vacuum fluctuations. To the question of why the Universe does not collapse under its own gravitational attraction we analyze the possibility to answer this by the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> these electrical charges. Evidence in support of the idea that space is not expanding is growing more and more in the scientific literature. As a frame of work we consider the model of a constant size Universe that implies a constant equilibrium between the gravitational (GM 2 /R 2) and the electrical forces (Q 2 /R 2).

40|$|We {{study the}} {{early stage of}} the phase {{separation}} of a binary mixture far from its critical point of demixing. Whenever the mixture <b>of</b> two mutually <b>repulsive</b> species is quenched to a temperature below its critical point <b>of</b> miscibility, the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the enthalpic <b>repulsive</b> <b>force</b> prevails upon the entropic tendency to mix, so that the system eventually separates into two coexisting phases. We have developed a highly non linear model, in close analogy with the linear theory of Cahn and Hilliard, where a generalized free energy is {{defined in terms of}} two parameters, psi and a, the first describing the equilibrium composition of the two phases and the second denoting a characteristic length scale that is inversely proportional to the equilibrium surface tension. The linear stability analysis predicts that any perturbation of the initial mixture composition with wave number k smaller than sqrt(2 psi / a) will grow exponentially in time, with a maximum growth corresponding to k_max = sqrt (psi/a). A numerical solution of the equation shows that nonlinear effects saturate the exponential growth, and that the concentration distribution tends to a steady state, periodic profile with wavelength lambda = 2 pi a / sqrt(psi) corresponding to the fastest growing mode of the linear regime. The main result of our theoretical model is that this steady state does not depend on the form of thye initial perturbation to the homogeneous composition profile...|$|R
5000|$|The {{situation}} changes somewhat {{with the}} introduction of dark energy or a cosmological constant. A cosmological constant due to a vacuum energy density has the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> adding a <b>repulsive</b> <b>force</b> between objects which is proportional (not inversely proportional) to distance. Unlike inertia it actively [...] "pulls" [...] on objects which have clumped together under the influence of gravity, and even on individual atoms. However, this does not cause the objects to grow steadily or to disintegrate; unless they are very weakly bound, they will simply settle into an equilibrium state which is slightly (undetectably) larger than it would otherwise have been. As the universe expands and the matter in it thins, the gravitational attraction decreases (since it is proportional to the density), while the cosmological repulsion increases; thus the ultimate fate of the ΛCDM universe is a near vacuum expanding at an ever-increasing rate {{under the influence of the}} cosmological constant. However, the only locally visible <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the accelerating expansion is the disappearance (by runaway redshift) of distant galaxies; gravitationally bound objects like the Milky Way do not expand and the Andromeda galaxy is moving fast enough towards us that it will still merge with the Milky Way in 3 billion years time, and it is also likely that the merged supergalaxy that forms will eventually fall in and merge with the nearby Virgo Cluster. However, galaxies lying farther away from this will recede away at ever-increasing speed and be redshifted out of our range of visibility.|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of slamming loads on structures is a challenging problem in both civil and industrial engineering. For instance, waves on coastal works and ship structures may occasionally induce high pressure peaks, causing significant stresses, despite their short duration. Similar problems arise in debris flow impact on structures. The work here presented {{is aimed at}} clarifying some aspects of a corrected version of the Weakly Compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (WCSPH) technique which need to be re-examined {{in order to improve}} the performance of the method in highly critical fluid-solid impact problems. The paper is particularly focused on the first stages – here specified as short term – of the phenomenon, where compressibility plays a key role. A test case is considered whereby a rectangular mass of fluid particles, 3. 95 m long and 0. 5 m high impacts against a vertical obstacle, with velocities ranging from 2 m/s to 10 m/s. The employed WCSPH code is applied with various computational options for the state equations and for the boundary conditions. Results show that the pressure distribution on the wall quickly increases as the impact process takes place, from the bottom to the free surface, with value which may reach up to tens of atmospheres according to fluid compressibility.

40|$|Electric fields, i. e., voltage gradients, are {{commonly}} used to drive flows in microfluidic devices because the resulting electroosmotic (EO) flow, which is uniform outside the very thin counterion screening layer next to the charged wall, has less convective dispersion than Poiseuille flow. Recent evanescent-wave particle velocimetry studies suggest, based on measurements of near-wall particle distributions, that colloidal neutrally buoyant particle tracers of radii a = O(0. 1 - 1 ?m) experience a <b>repulsive</b> wall-normal <b>force</b> {{in the presence of}} an electric field of magnitude E applied parallel to the wall of O(10 ? 14 N). The magnitude of the force appears to scale as E 2 and a 2, in agreement with theoretical predictions of a nonlinear 9 ̆ 3 dielectrophoretic-like 9 ̆ 4 force, although the experimental estimates of the actual force magnitude are 10 ? 30 times greater than the theoretical predictions. Given that the force magnitude is proportional to a 2, particles of different radii will have different average wall-particle separations, and therefore sample different average velocities, in a nonuniform flow in the presence of an electric field. Evanescent-wave particle velocimetry was therefore used to study the combined EO and Poiseuille flow of dilute aqueous monovalent electrolyte solutions at E < 33 V/cm and pressure gradients ?p/L < 1. 1 Bar/m in 30 ?m fused-silica microchannels using a = 125 nm and a = 245 nm fluorescent polystyrene (PS) tracer particles. For this creeping flow, the velocity of the combined flow will be a simple shear flow due to the superposition of the EO and Poiseuille flow velocities. As expected, the average velocities measured by tracers of different sizes in combined flow under otherwise identical conditions differ, due to the discrepancy in their average wall-particle separations. The velocity profiles measured by evanescent-wave particle velocimetry for both tracers are, however, in good agreement {{with each other and with}} theory after accounting for the wall-normal positions of the particles. The <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> the <b>repulsive</b> wall-normal <b>force</b> observed in EO flow, and the shear-induced electrokinetic lift force first reported twenty years ago in Poiseuille flow, are observed in the near-wall distributions of the larger particles. Interestingly, a <b>repulsive</b> <b>force</b> with an estimated magnitude that appears to exceed the sum of these two forces is observed in combined electroosmotic and Poiseuille flow for the a = 245 nm particles.
