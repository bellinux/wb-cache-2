40|$|We {{study the}} {{interaction}} between a tensionless (null) string and an antisymmetric background field B_ab using a 2 -component spinor formalism. A geometric condition {{for the absence of}} such an interaction is formulated. We show that only one gauge-invariant degree of freedom of the field B_ab does not satisfy this condition. Identification of this degree of freedom with the notoph field ϕ of Ogievetskii-Polubarinov-Kalb-Ramond is suggested. Application of a two-component spinor formalism allows us a reduction of the complete system of non-linear partial differential equations and constraints governing the interacting null string dynamics to a system of linear differential equations for the basis spinors of the spin-frame. We find that total effect of the interaction is contained in a single <b>derivation</b> <b>coefficient</b> which is identified with the notoph field. Comment: 15 pages, no figures, RevTeX 3. ...|$|E

In this talk, ideas of mean, standard <b>derivation,</b> <b>coefficient</b> of variation, prior probability, Bayes theorem and graphical methods are illustrated using forensic examples. Students find the examples interesting and the applications of statistics useful in forensic science. 1. DNA Profiling: Test of Independence DNA profiling/fingerprinting is a very powerful method for human identification (Jeffreys, et al., 1985). It is regarded as one of the most important discoveries in forensic science since the introduction of dermal fingerprinting. In theory, no two persons, except for identical twins, have the same DNA sequence. However, with the DNA markers/loci that are currently in use, a unique identification cannot be assured. Consider a case where a crime has been committed, a blood stain (from perpetrator) is found in the crime scene and a suspect has been identified. Suppose that the DNA found at the crime scene is typed with alleles (distinct types or lengths of DNA) { 8, 9 } (a person inherits two alleles from his or her parents) at the DNA locus TPOX and that the DNA of the suspect has the same alleles. Under the current legal system, the frequency or the match probability of the alleles has to be calculated and reported in the courtroom. This can be obtained as 2 p 8 p 9, where 8 p and p 9 are the frequencies of alleles 8 and 9 respectively. In the Hong Kong Chinese population, this frequency is evaluated as 2 × 0...|$|E

40|$|The Remote Working Level Monitor (RWLM) is an {{instrument}} used to remotely monitor the RN-daughter concentrations and the Working Level (WL). It is an ac powered, microprocessor based instrument which multiplexes two independent detector units {{to a single}} central processor unit (CPU).

The remote detector units are fully automated and require no manual operation once they are set up.
