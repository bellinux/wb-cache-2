40|$|The recent paper {{entitled}} by K. C. Lee et al. (2011) establishes nonlocal macroscopic quantum correlations, {{which they}} term “entanglement”, under ambient conditions. Photon(s) -phonon entanglements are established within each interferometer arm. However, our analysis demonstrates, the phonon fields between arms become correlated {{as a result}} of single-photon wavepacket path indistinguishability, not true nonlocal entanglement. We also note that a coherence expansion (as opposed to decoherence) resulted from local entanglement which was not recognized. It occurred from nearly identical Raman scattering in each arm (importantly not meeting the Born and Markovian approximations). The ability to establish nonlocal macroscopic quantum correlations through path indistinguishability rather than entanglement offers the opportunity to greatly expand quantum macroscopic theory and application, even though it was not true nonlocal entanglement.

40|$|Background and Objective—To {{measure the}} subfoveal choroidal {{thickness}} {{in patients with}} age-related macular degeneration (AMD) over 6 months. Study Design/Patients and Methods—A retrospective, observational study of patients with AMD followed for 6 months at the New England Eye Center. Baseline and 6 month subfoveal choroidal thickness was measured using spectral domain OCT and compared. Results—For the entire cohort there was statistically significant thinning of the subfoveal choroidal thickness at 6 months compared to baseline, which was driven by the cohort of patients with neovascular AMD [181. 2 +/− 75 μm to 173. 4 +/− 63 μm] p= 0. 049. (Figure and Table 1). Conclusions—There was a statistically significant decrease in subfoveal choroidal thickness observed in this cohort of patients with AMD over 6 months, but it was driven by one subgroup, those patients with neovascular age related macular degenerationResearch to Prevent Blindness, Inc.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the design of}} spatially varying porosity profiles in next-generation electrodes based on simultaneous optimization of a porous-electrode model. Model-based optimal design (not including the solid-phase intercalation mechanism) is applied to a porous positive electrode made of lithium cobalt oxide, which is commonly used in lithium-ion batteries for various applications. For a fixed amount of active material, optimal grading of the porosity across the electrode was found to decrease the ohmic resistance by 15 %– 33 %, which in turn increases the electrode capacity to hold and deliver energy. The optimal porosity grading was predicted to have 40 % lower variation in the ohmic resistance to variations in model parameters due to manufacturing imprecision or capacity fade. The {{results suggest that the}} potential for the simultaneous model-based design of electrode material properties that employ more detailed physics-based first-principles electrochemical engineering models to determine optimal design values for manufacture and experimental evaluation.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{fundamental}} properties of femtosecond-laser (fs-laser) hyperdoping by developing techniques {{to control the}} surface morphology following laser irradiation. By decoupling the formation of surface roughness from the doping process, we study the structural and electronic properties of fs-laser doped silicon. These experiments are a necessary step toward developing predictive models of the doping process. We use a single fs-laser pulse to dope silicon with sulfur, enabling quantitative secondary ion mass spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy, and Hall effect measurements. These measurements indicate that at laser fluences at or above 4 [*]kJ[*]m[superscript − 2], a single laser pulse yields a sulfur dose >(3 [*]±[*] 1) [*]×[*] 10 [superscript 13][*]cm[superscript − 2] and results in a 45 -nm thick amorphous surface layer. Based on these results, we demonstrate a method for hyperdoping large areas of silicon without producing the surface roughness.

40|$|Silicon doped with nonequilibrium {{concentrations}} of chalcogens using a femtosecond laser exhibits near-unity absorption of sub-bandgap photons to wavelengths {{of at least}} 2500 nm. Previous {{studies have shown that}} sub-bandgap absorptance decreases with thermal annealing up to 1175 K and that the absorption deactivation correlates with chalcogen diffusivity. In this work, we show that sub-bandgap absorptance can be reactivated by annealing at temperatures between 1350 and 1550 K followed by fast cooling (> 50  K/s). Our results suggest that the defects responsible for sub-bandgap absorptance are in equilibrium at high temperatures in hyperdoped Si:chalcogen systems.

40|$|In this note, we {{consider}} the permutahedron, the convex hull of all permutations of { 1, 2 …,n}. We show how to obtain an extended formulation for this polytope from any sorting network. By using the optimal Ajtai–Komlós–Szemerédi sorting network, this extended formulation has Θ(nlogn) variables and inequalities. Furthermore, from basic polyhedral arguments, we show that this is best possible (up to a multiplicative constant) since any extended formulation has at least Ω(nlogn) inequalities. The results easily extend to the generalized permutahedron.

40|$|We {{performed}} OCT imaging {{of the rat}} retina at 70, 000 axial scans {{per second}} with ~ 3 μm axial resolution. Three-dimensional OCT (3 D-OCT) data sets of the rat retina were acquired. The high speed and high density data sets enable improved en face visualization by reducing eye motion artifacts and improve Doppler OCT measurements. Minimal motion artifacts were visible and the OCT fundus images offer more precise registration of individual OCT images to retinal fundus features. Projection OCT fundus images show features such as the nerve fiber layer, retinal capillary networks and choroidal vasculature. Doppler OCT images and quantitative measurements show pulsatility in retinal blood vessels. Doppler OCT provides noninvasive in vivo quantitative measurements of retinal blood flow properties and may benefit studies of diseases such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. Ultrahigh speed imaging using ultrahigh resolution spectral / Fourier domain OCT promises to enable novel protocols for measuring small animal retinal structure and retinal blood flow. This non-invasive imaging technology is a promising tool for monitoring disease progression in rat and mouse models to assess ocular disease pathogenesis and response to treatment.
