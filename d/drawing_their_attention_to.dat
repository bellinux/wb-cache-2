The critical and commercial success of the film became the deciding factor for pursuing a stage version. It was decided that the musical version would follow the storyline established by the film, due to audience's familiarity with it, but with a more contemporary feel in order to appeal to younger audience members. Accordingly, the character of Gusti Putri, who was sombre and philosophical in the film, was reinterpreted as being younger and more playful in the stage version. Tiara said that the reinterpretation of the character was in part inspired by the success of her music single [...] "Asmaradana", which was recorded for the film and became a hit among young Malaysian music fans, <b>drawing</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the film itself.|$|E

However, teaching arithmetic to pre-school children can be challenging as children around that age have short attention span and prefer to engage in interactive activities.

40|$|Introduction PROMAM is a {{prompting}} {{system for}} mammography {{which aims to}} improve radiologists ' detection performance by <b>drawing</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> possible ill-defined lesions and micro-calcification clusters. Various approaches such as ROC methodology or McNemar's test (a paired binary response statistic) {{have been used to}} quantify the performance gains that might be achieved through the radiologist's use of such a prompting system [5, 6]. However, they tell us little about radiologists' understanding of the system, nor about how radiologists use the prompts to inform their decision-making. Our earlier studies of PROMAM's use have demonstrated that these factors may be critical to its effectiveness [2, 3]. In particular, we believe that it is important to: 1. ensure that the radiologists develop a correct understanding of the system's scope and function, 2. ensure that prompting information is being used appropriately, and 3. understand how radiologists' use of the system ch...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This article {{presents}} the results of a pretest-postest study which examined the impact of different instructional procedures on the ability of Grade 2 elementary children in experimental and control groups to produce written expository texts involving a comparison. Referring to texts the children had read to prepare them for the writing activity, instruction variously focused on <b>drawing</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the rhetorical structure and linguistic features typically associated with the targeted genre. The results reported herein pertain to how the children used their readings as a resource for the informational content of the texts they produced during the post-test. Overall, semantic analysis of the informational content reveals no significant difference between experimental and control groups. However, children in the experimental group significantly outperformed the latter in terms of their ability to produce texts which, from a rhetorical perspective, better reflected the features associated with texts involving comparisons...|$|E
