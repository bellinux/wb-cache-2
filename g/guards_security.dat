They were somewhat similar to another Ottoman organization, the Voynuks, recruited in South Slavic territories, initially tasked with the defense and security, then later used as auxiliary transportation units.|$|E

50|$|Between January 1996 and April 1996 the {{clearance}} of approximately 360 acre of land including 120 acre of woodland, and the felling of nearly 10,000 mature trees {{to make way}} for the construction of the road, led to some of the largest anti-road protests in European history. Around 7,000 people demonstrated on the site of the bypass route in some way and over 800 arrests were made. The cost of policing the protest (known as 'Operation Prospect' and run jointly by Thames Valley Police and Hampshire Constabulary) had reached approximately £5 million by December 1996. An additional £30 million was spent on private security <b>guards,</b> <b>security</b> fencing, and security lighting while the works were in progress, of which only £7 million was budgeted for in the original contract.|$|E
50|$|Each {{mission is}} framed around {{the killing of}} one or more individuals, which the main protagonist, Agent 47 must accomplish.

A few facilities even use biometric thumbprint or hand scanners to ensure that access is granted only to those that rent. Self-storage facility operators frequently provide 24-hour access, climate controlled storage, outdoor storage for RVs and boats, and lights or power outlets inside the storage unit as amenities to set themselves apart from competitors. Some storage facilities have open roofs i.e. a wire mesh roof which are not that secure, compared to ones that have full covered tin roofs that provide added security and privacy.|$|E
5000|$|After Empress Wenxian Empress Dugu) died, Emperor Wen greatly favored both Consort Chen (the Lady Xuanhua) and Consort Cai (the Lady Ronghua). Consort Chen was the {{daughter}} of Emperor Xuan of Chen. Consort Cai was from Danyang in modern Nanjing,. The Emperor grew ill at Renshou Palace, and was bedridden. Yang Su, the left head of the Shangshu Sheng, Liu Shu (柳述), the minister of defense Wen's son-in-law as the husband of his daughter Yang Awu (楊阿五) the Princess Lanling), and Yuan Yan (元巖) the court administrator, were all attending to him. The Emperor ordered the Crown Prince to enter the palace to stay at Dabao Hall (大寶殿). The Crown Prince thought that precautions needed to be taken in case of the Emperor's death, and therefore he personally wrote a secret note to inquire of Yang Su what precautions to take. Yang Su wrote a return note detailing his security precautions, but by error the palace attendants delivered it to the Emperor. The Emperor was greatly displeased. Further, one morning, Consort Chen was going to the latrine. Yang Guang could not resist her beauty, and grabbed her, wanting to have sexual relations with her. She resisted and fled back to the Emperor. The Emperor was surprised by her anxiety and asked her; she shed tears and stated, [...] "The Crown Prince was being indecent to me." [...] The Emperor was shocked and angry, pounding the bed and stating, [...] "Animal! How can I give him the important affairs? Dugu destroyed me!" [...] He then summoned Liu and Yuan, telling them, [...] "Summon my son!" [...] They were about to summon the Crown Prince when he clarified, [...] "Yang Yong!" [...] Liu and Yuan left the palace to write the edict. When Yang Su heard this, he reported to the Crown Prince, and thereafter an edict of the Emperor was forged to arrest Liu and Yuan and detain them at the jail at the Supreme Court. The guards of the Eastern Palace the Crown Prince's guards) were summoned to take over security from the Renshou Palace <b>guards.</b> <b>Security</b> measures were instituted to disallow entry into or exit out of the palace. Yuwen Shu and Guo Yan (郭衍) were put in command. Further, the deputy chief of staff for the Crown Prince's palace, Zhang Heng (張衡) entered the Emperor's palace to attend to his medical needs. Zhang expelled all of the ladies in waiting and the eunuchs. Soon thereafter, the Emperor died. Thereafter, there were different views as to how he died. When Consort Chen and the other women of the palace heard of this, they stared at each other in fear and shook with fear. At dusk, the Crown Prince sent a eunuch with a small gold box, personally sealed by the Crown Prince, to be delivered to Consort Chen. When Consort Chen saw it, she, believing that there was poison inside, was very fearful, and did not dare to open it. Only after the eunuch urged her did she open it. Instead, the box contained several tongxin knots a decoration showing love). Her ladies in waiting were relieved and became happy, stating to each other, [...] "Finally, death is avoided." [...] Consort Chen, in shame and anger, sat down and refused to accept the box. The ladies in waiting forced her to bow to the eunuch. That night, the Crown Prince ordered Consort Chen to have sexual relations with him.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Security</b> <b>guards</b> give service within several {{ranges of}} tasks. In {{the line of}} duty in various work settings, guards may be {{expected}} to maintain order and to detain criminal violators while appointed to a single property or placed on patrol for various sites or territories. Concisely, a <b>security</b> <b>guard</b> may encounter a variety of situations, locations, and behaviours. With such a heavy responsibility and important duties, {{it is very important to}} make sure that the <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> are mentally and behaviourally healthy and safe. Concerning these issues, this study aimed to identify types of mental health problem and aggression among <b>security</b> <b>guards.</b> In addition, association between mental health problems and aggression, and difference between male and female <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> in terms of mental health problems were examined. Self-report surveys were conducted among 300 <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> in data collection. The findings identified four subtypes of mental health problems: substance abuse, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and depression, experienced by the <b>security</b> <b>guards.</b> The <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> were also reported to be performing physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger, and hostility. Male and female <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> showed significant difference in occurrence of mental health problems. The association between the mental health problems and aggression were also found mostly significant. Concisely, prevalence of mental health problems and aggressive behaviours was identified among <b>security</b> <b>guards.</b> These findings suggest that people wh...|$|R

40|$|This study {{identifies}} the costs involved with using Open Source Software and estimates {{the average cost}} of licenses and other costs in using proprietary software. Costs of retraining IT staff to configure and maintain Linux servers, costs of retraining regular staff to use Open Source desktop applications and costs of support from an out side agency to help answer queries and difficulties staff may have in using Open Source software are identified as costs applying to Linux but not to proprietary software while costs of administration staff time in sorting out licenses, extra time of IT staff spent on installing proprietary software, updating virus <b>guards,</b> <b>security</b> updates and sorting out virus damages are shown as costs applying to Proprietary software. Costing is done only for costs that differ between the two systems. In arriving at the total costs, a pessimistic approach is used for Open Source costs and an optimistic approach is used to estimate Proprietary software costs to ensure that the practical cost savings are not less than what is predicted. The estimates show that Rs. 1 0 1, 000 would be spent on licenses for an average computer in an organization. This is shown to bean astounding 1 billion rupees just for the 30 organizations analyzed in this study. The costs for using Open Source would be less than 15, 088 for an entire 3 year period. A minimum saving of 85 % is predicted if Open Source software is used. While the balance 15 % would diminish with experience as the costs primarily is on training A severe lack of awareness and knowledge about OSS is seen in IT decision makers in the organizations surveyed in the study. This could lead to choosing proprietary software over Open Source based on the wrong reasons. It is recommended that the government step in and create an agency which will create an up to-date awareness about Open Source and give wide scale advocacy towards promoting OSS usage. It also suggests setting up a research branch to find out and test the latest developments and inform the wider public about them and recommend the best Open Source solutions as well as provide consultancy to organizations that want to migrate to OSS...|$|E
