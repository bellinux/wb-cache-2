2500|$|The most {{immediately}} obvious {{difference between}} the two designs was that the Fafnir 2 was a mid-wing aircraft. [...] The original Fafnir had a high wing and initially suffered serious aerodynamic <b>drag</b> <b>losses</b> at the wing-fuselage junctions. [...] Wind tunnel studies at the University of GÃ¶ttingen showed that these losses were lower with mid-wing designs. They also suggested that the wing and fuselage be integrated and the latter be cambered to provide some lift. [...] The strongly tapered wing was ply covered ahead of the single spar, forming a torsion resisting D-box, and fabric covered aft over most of the span, though the surface near the fuselage was wholly ply covered. The wing section, designed by Lippisch himself, was much thinner and less cambered than on the Fafnir, with less low speed lift but also less high speed drag, reflecting the increasing understanding that cross country gliding required speed between thermals as well as the ability to climb within them. As on the original Fafnir, only the inner 40% of the span had dihedral. Tapered ailerons, their chord increasing outwards, occupied all the trailing edge of the outer panels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Drag</b> <b>loss</b> of {{vehicles}} like aircraft or ships generally increases less than proportional with increasing cargo volume, although the physical details {{can be quite}} complicated.

50|$|In {{order to}} appreciably reduce {{the mass of}} the oxygen carried at launch, a LACE vehicle needs to spend more time in the lower {{atmosphere}} to collect enough oxygen to supply the engines during the remainder of the launch. This leads to greatly increased vehicle heating and <b>drag</b> <b>losses,</b> which therefore increases fuel consumption to offset the <b>drag</b> <b>losses</b> and the additional mass of the thermal protection system. This increased fuel consumption offsets somewhat the savings in oxidizer mass; these losses are in turn offset by the higher specific impulse, I, of the air-breathing engine. Thus, the engineering trade-offs involved are quite complex, and highly sensitive to the design assumptions made.|$|E
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{theoretically}} optimal nozzle {{shape for}} maximal exhaust speed.

30|$|Efficient {{wellbore}} cleaning is {{an important}} goal in a drilling operation especially in horizontal and deviated wells since it can prevent problems such as stuck pipe, lost circulation, high torque and <b>drag,</b> <b>loss</b> of control on density ECDs, and finally it can {{reduce the cost of}} the drilling operations (Ozbayoglu et al. 2003). Some of affective parameters on wellbore cleaning have been studied by some researchers experimentally (Tomren et al. 1986; Yu et al. 2004; Ford et al. 1990; Hareland et al. 1993; Okrajni and Azar 1986; Sifferman and Becker 1992; Hussaini and Azar 1983) and by modeling approach (Nguyen and Rahman 1998; Wazed 2002; Akhshik et al. 2015; Zhu et al. 2013).|$|R
50|$|Although the EMB 120, {{like all}} transport-category multi-engine airplanes, is {{designed}} to fly with one engine inoperative, the distortion of the engine resulted in excessive <b>drag</b> and <b>loss</b> of lift {{on the left side}} of the aircraft, causing it to rapidly lose altitude.|$|R

50|$|Hydrogen {{has very}} low viscosity, a {{favorable}} property for reducing <b>drag</b> <b>losses</b> in the rotor; these losses can be significant, as the rotors have large diameter and high rotational speed. Every {{reduction in the}} purity of the hydrogen coolant increases windage losses in the turbine; as air is 14 times more dense than hydrogen, each 1% of air corresponds to about 14% increase of density of the coolant and the associated increase of viscosity and drag. A purity drop from 97 to 95% in a large generator can increase windage losses by 32%; this equals to 685 kW for a 907 MW generator. The windage losses also increase heat losses of the generator and the associated cooling problems.|$|E
40|$|We {{predict the}} charm and bottom quark nuclear {{modification}} factors using weakly coupled pQCD and strongly coupled AdS/CFT drag methods. The log(pT/M_Q) /pT dependence of pQCD loss and the momentum independence of <b>drag</b> <b>loss</b> lead to different momentum dependencies for the R_{AA} predictions. This difference {{is enhanced by}} examining a new experimental observable, the double ratio of charm to bottom nuclear modification factors, R^{cb}=R^c_{AA}/R^b_{AA}. At LHC the weakly coupled theory predicts R^{cb} goes to 1; whereas the strongly coupled theory predicts R^{cb}. 2 independent of pT. At RHIC the differences are less dramatic, as the production spectra are harder, but the drag formula is applicable to higher momenta, due to the lower temperature. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures.

40|$|Recent {{research}} on pneumatic tire hydroplaning has been collected and summarized {{with the aim}} of describing what is presently known about the phenomena of tire hydroplaning. A physical description of tire hydroplaning is given along with formulae for estimating the ground speed at which it occurs. Eight manifestations of tire hydroplaning which have been experimentally observed are presented and discussed. These manifestations are: detachment of tire footprint, hydrodynamic ground pressure, spin-down of wheel, suppression of tire bow wave, scouring action of escaping fluid in tire-ground footprint region, peaking of fluid displacement <b>drag,</b> <b>loss</b> in braking traction, and loss of tire directional stability. The vehicle, pavement, tire, and fluid parameters of importance to tire hydroplaning are listed and described. Finally, the hazards of tire hydroplaning to ground and air-vehicle-ground performance are listed, and procedures are given to minimize these effects...|$|R
40|$|Of all {{the types}} of drag, induced drag is {{associated}} with the creation and generation of lift over wings. Induced drag is directly driven by the span load that the aircraft is flying at. The tools by which to calculate and predict induced drag we use were created by Ludwig Prandtl in 1903. Within a decade after Prandtl created a tool for calculating induced drag, Prandtl and his students had optimized the problem to solve the minimum induced drag for a wing of a given span, formalized and written about in 1920. This solution is quoted in textbooks extensively today. Prandtl did not stop with this first solution, and came to a dramatically different solution in 1932. Subsequent development of this 1932 solution solves several aeronautics design difficulties simultaneously, including maximum performance, minimum structure, minimum <b>drag</b> <b>loss</b> due to control input, and solution to adverse yaw without a vertical tail. This presentation lists that solution by Prandtl, and the refinements by Horten, Jones, Kline, Viswanathan, and Whitcom...|$|R
5000|$|The 40 megajoules per {{kilogram}} or less {{kinetic energy}} of projectiles launched {{at up to}} 9000 m/s velocity (if including extra for <b>drag</b> <b>losses)</b> towards Low Earth Orbit is a few kilowatt-hours per kilogram if efficiencies are relatively high, which accordingly has been hypothesized to be under $1 of electrical energy cost per kilogram shipped to LEO, though total costs {{would be far more}} than electricity alone. [...] By being mainly located slightly above, on or beneath the ground, a mass driver may be easier to maintain compared with many other structures of non-rocket spacelaunch. Whether or not underground, it needs to be housed in a pipe that is vacuum pumped in order to prevent internal air drag, such as with a mechanical shutter kept closed most of the time but a plasma window used during the moments of firing to prevent loss of vacuum.|$|E
50|$|Maximum {{engine thrust}} â The maximum thrust the rocket engine can produce affects {{several aspects of}} the gravity turn procedure. Firstly, before the pitch over {{maneuver}} the vehicle must be capable of not only overcoming {{the force of gravity}} but accelerating upwards. The more acceleration the vehicle has beyond the acceleration of gravity the quicker vertical speed can be obtained allowing for lower gravity drag in the initial launch phase. When the pitch over is executed the vehicle begins its downrange acceleration phase; engine thrust affects this phase as well. Higher thrust allows for a faster acceleration to orbital velocity as well. By reducing this time the rocket can level off sooner; further reducing gravity <b>drag</b> <b>losses.</b> Although higher thrust can make the launch more efficient, accelerating too much low in the atmosphere increases the maximum dynamic pressure. This can be alleviated by throttling the engines back during the beginning of downrange acceleration until the vehicle has climbed higher. However, with solid fuel rockets this may not be possible.|$|E
5000|$|A space {{tower is}} a tower that would reach outer space. To avoid an {{immediate}} {{need for a}} vehicle launched at orbital velocity to raise its perigee, a tower would have to extend above the edge of space (above the 100 km KÃ¡rmÃ¡n line), but a far lower tower height could reduce atmospheric <b>drag</b> <b>losses</b> during ascent. If the tower {{went all the way}} to geosynchronous orbit at approximately 36,000 km, or 22,369 miles, objects released at such height could then drift away with minimal power and would be in a circular orbit. The concept of a structure reaching to geosynchronous orbit was first conceived by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky.The original concept envisioned by Tsiolkovsky was a compression structure. Building a compression structure from the ground up proved an unrealistic task as there was no material in existence with enough compressive strength to support its own weight under such conditions.Other ideas use very tall compressive towers to reduce the demands on launch vehicles. The vehicle is [...] "elevated" [...] up the tower, which may extend above the atmosphere and is launched from the top. Such a tall tower to access near-space altitudes of 20 km has been proposed by various researchers.|$|E
40|$|The {{power gain}} and thrust for plasma engines {{available}} by unreeling 10 km of insulated Al wire from a spacecraft are investigated. The wire, unreeling in the vertical, {{would cut the}} earth's magnetic field lines, thereby generating 20 kW {{of power in the}} wire. A <b>drag</b> <b>loss</b> of 20. 4 kJ/sec would reduce the power gain to 18. 7 kW, an efficiency of 92 percent. Thicker wires could push the power gain to 1 MW at 95 percent efficiency. Conductive 'balloons' at the ends of the tether would function as ionospheric 'brushes' to complete the circuit. Reversing the IXB force by employing on-board stored power would drive the tether current against the induced voltage, providing a 1 N thrust for 8 kW of energy consumed, which could be supplied by solar panels during the day portion of orbit. The equivalent thrust by conventional stationkeeping means would consume 8000 kg of propellant/yr. Techniques for stabilizing the tether in the presence of variable magnetic fields are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The rapidly {{expanding}} civil aerospace sector {{is subjected to}} ever increasing pressure to be both sustainable and competitive. The research reported in the current thesis forms {{a part of the}} significant R&D effort of Rolls-Royce in response to this pressure. A broad based approach is taken to evaluating compressor blade surface finish with the objective of improving manufacturing and operating efficiency. Technical developments made as part of the current work is also intended to support future research in this important field. Compressor blade surface finish is emulated in the lab to detail its topographical development through the critical final polishing stage of processing. Based on existing surface standards a new characteristic developmental pattern and nomenclature is described for this finishing process. In addition, âedge shadowingâ a novel surface texture distribution is reported showing mass finishing to be non-uniform over a flat surface. The surface texture of exemplar âas manufacturedâ compressor blades is assessed and a protocol for areal parametric characterisation is developed. The protocol includes consideration of; surface texture homogeneity, local & global sample weighting, sampling efficiency, and key characteristic areal parameters, with their specification levels and confidence intervals. This detailed examination of mass finishing and the surface texture it produces will help improve process control and optimise economy. To improve the ongoing assessment of compressor performance degradation in service, a series of recovered compressor blades are characterised. Predominantly automated techniques are developed to assess compressor blade side and leading edge character. Key trends in surface topography on individual blade surface regions are reported along with broader degradation trends throughout the compressor. Leading edges are shown to be characteristically prone to greater degradation and levels of surface roughness, though elevated leading edge roughness is better correlated with deposits than with erosion. Proper analysis of aerodynamic losses due to aerofoil surface roughness requires the use of techniques with conflicting requirements. Thus in the current context the replication of metallic test aerofoils in thermally insulating resin is required. A method for this replication and its validation are presented. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of <b>drag</b> <b>loss</b> due to surface roughness a series of rough test aerofoil surfaces were parametrically characterised and wind tunnel tested. The well-established but incomplete correlation between <b>drag</b> <b>loss</b> and mean surface roughness amplitude (Sa) is then refined with other selected parameters that more fully represent surface topography...|$|R

5000|$|Most significantly, the LACE {{system is}} far heavier than a pure rocket engine {{having the same}} thrust (air-breathing engines of almost all types have {{relatively}} poor thrust-to-weight ratios compared to rockets), {{and the performance of}} launch vehicles of all types is particularly affected by increases in vehicle dry mass (such as engines) that must be carried all the way to orbit, as opposed to oxidizer mass that would be burnt off {{over the course of the}} flight. Moreover, the lower thrust-to-weight ratio of an air-breathing engine as compared to a rocket significantly decreases the launch vehicle's maximum possible acceleration, and increases gravity losses since more time must be spent to accelerate to orbital velocity. Also, the higher inlet and airframe <b>drag</b> <b>losses</b> of a lifting, air-breathing vehicle launch trajectory as compared to a pure rocket on a ballistic launch trajectory introduces an additional penalty term [...] into the rocket equation known as the air-breather's burden.

The <b>drag</b> <b>losses</b> considered in this analysis are those due to (1) the extra drag imposed on the airplane by the weight of the intercooler, its duct, and its supports and (2) the drag sustained by the cooling air in flowing through the intercooler and its duct.

The optimum values of cooling air pressure drop and weight flow ratio are tabulated. Curves are presented to illustrate the results of the analysis...|$|E
50|$|The {{rectangular}} cross-section fuselage consisted of four spruce Warren girders, fabric covered behind the engine. The cockpit {{was at the}} trailing edge of the wing and behind there was a deep, rounded fabric covered decking. In front of the cockpit the decking was continued in aluminium, enclosing the fuel tank. Forward of this and beyond a firewall, the inverted in-line engine was mounted on a frame of square section steel members. It drove a two bladed metal propeller. Comper was an early adopter of retractable undercarriages for light aircraft {{at a time when the}} balance of advantage between <b>drag</b> <b>loss</b> and weight penalty was not obvious. The main wheels of the Streak were mounted at the end of the wing centre section, each between pairs of compression legs. Pairs of cross braced struts, joining the legs a little way above the axle and hinged at top and bottom, rotated to retract the wheels rearwards. In common with many aircraft of the time, the retracted undercarriage left a part of the wheel exposed, to give some protection in a wheels up landing. The wheels, which had brakes, were retracted manually via a heavily geared down, bicycle chain drive. At the rear there was a simple, sprung tailskid.|$|R
