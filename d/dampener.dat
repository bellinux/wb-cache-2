25|$|Three days later, the Saints hosted Norwich City {{looking for}} a third {{consecutive}} win. The game started well for the home side, who dominated possession {{in the early stages}} and broke the deadlock in the 32nd minute when Rickie Lambert converted a chance from an Adam Lallana free kick. On the stroke of half time though, Robert Snodgrass equalised for the visitors to put a <b>dampener</b> on the spirits of the players going into the break. In the second period Norwich came out with much more confidence, and shut Southampton out of the game for a large period, with the defence weakening quickly. Southampton and Norwich were held in the deadlock though, with the sides sharing the spoils and the hosts failing {{to move out of the}} top relegation spot again.|$|E
2500|$|The {{temperatures}} on Mount Kenya fluctuate greatly. This fluctuation is largest on {{the lower}} slopes of the moorland zone. At an altitude of [...] there is an 11.5°C mean range in daily temperature, this goes down to 7.5°C at [...] and 4°C at [...] The diurnal temperature fluctuation reduces with altitude, and so the lapse rate decreases {{during the course of}} the day. This effect means the lapse rate during the day on Mount Kenya is lower than average for dry air. At night the lapse rate is again lower than average for dry air due to the katabatic winds from the glaciers. The temperature fluctuation is less in the wet season as the constant clouds act as a <b>dampener.</b>|$|E

There is offered a technique including accelerated aging <b>dampeners</b> for extended life, accelerated life tests and validation of their basic functional characteristics: creep, strength and stiffness.

50|$|Ships can be {{deliberately}} {{moved and}} rotated by a player {{as long as}} they are powered and have at least one gyroscope, thruster, and cockpit. To be able to move in any direction and then be able to stop effectively via inertia <b>dampeners,</b> thrusters must be placed on the structure facing up, down, forward, backward, left, and right. More gyroscopes on a ship will increase the ships ability to rotate in space, but in order for the inertial <b>dampeners</b> to be more effective, more thrusters must be added in each direction in which dampening is required.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{production}} model, the Sea Fury F Mk X (Fighter, Mk 10), flew in September 1946. With {{the completion}} of flight testing at Boscombe Down in 1946, the trials process was repeated aboard the aircraft carrier [...] Carrier testing revealed directional stability issues related to rudder effectiveness during landing, and this was resolved by {{the adoption of a}} tail wheel lock, which also improved the wheel retraction behaviour. Several rectifying design changes were made by Hawker in response to feedback from the test pilots, including the adoption of a five-bladed Rotol propeller to greatly reduce overspeed tendencies, a re-designed rudder assembly to increase rudder effectiveness, Dynafocal engine mountings to reduce vibration at low speeds, and an improved undercarriage with greater flexibility; these changes greatly improved the aircraft's deck landing characteristics. Arrestor hook trials initially revealed the Sea Fury to be prone to missing the wires, this was rapidly resolved by modifications to the hook <b>dampener</b> mechanism.|$|E

50|$|Triplex plunger pumps use three plungers, {{which reduces}} the {{pulsation}} of single reciprocating plunger pumps. Adding a pulsation <b>dampener</b> on the pump outlet can further smooth the pump ripple, or ripple graph of a pump transducer. The dynamic {{relationship of the}} high-pressure fluid and plunger generally requires high-quality plunger seals. Plunger pumps with {{a larger number of}} plungers have the benefit of increased flow, or smoother flow without a pulsation <b>dampener.</b> The increase in moving parts and crankshaft load is one drawback.|$|E

50|$|The studio {{building}} {{which is}} nicknamed 'Warehouse 13' {{was founded in}} an era which saw an increased popularity for the recording of independent musicians in Chicago. Robert Pretty and company designed the studio building to accommodate the unusual acts that would record there. The live room of the studio is very large, with space for bands to set up expanded drum sets, percussion sections, multiple guitar and bass amps, keyboards/synthesizers, and DIY-homemade instruments which are sometimes seen in the studio. One side of the live room wall is covered with custom made foil encrusted foam sound <b>dampeners</b> designed and shipped by an engineer from NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA. These foil sound <b>dampeners</b> were designed to both bounce sound waves across the room in a stereo pattern, and to absorb certain frequencies for noise control.|$|R
50|$|Psimon {{possesses}} powerful telepathic and telekinetic abilities. With his telepathy, he {{can read}} minds, take over other people’s minds {{to force them}} to do his bidding, cast telepathic illusions so that he or others may appear to be someone else. His telekinesis allows him to move objects, and can even affect large objects in his presence but outside his line of sight, as when he caused a ceiling to collapse onto Outsider Nightwing. Devices known as psychic <b>dampeners</b> can be used to prohibit him from using his powers, either by having him wear one, as had been done when he was incarcerated in the Slab, or by being worn by a potential victim, though Psimon can override the <b>dampener’s</b> effectiveness by coming into physical contact with the victim, specifically by placing his hands on the victim’s head.|$|R
