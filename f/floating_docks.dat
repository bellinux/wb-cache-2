5|$|By July 1929 {{the last}} of the {{superstructure}} had been cleared, and Bremse was turned upside down using techniques developed on salvaging some of the destroyers. Compressors were then used to pump air into the hull and bring her to the surface, while she was supported by 9-inch wires attached to two <b>floating</b> <b>docks</b> anchored on her port shoreward side. The salvage teams had almost raised her when she suddenly toppled onto her side and then heeled over gradually during the night, settling onto the rocks inshore.|$|E
5|$|Turkey has a {{sizeable}} automotive industry, which produced over 1.3 million motor vehicles in 2015, ranking as the 14th largest producer in the world. Turkish shipbuilding exports were worth US$1.2 billion in 2011. The major export markets are Malta, Marshall Islands, Panama and the United Kingdom. Turkish shipyards have 15 <b>floating</b> <b>docks</b> {{of different sizes}} and one dry dock. Tuzla, Yalova, and İzmit have developed into dynamic shipbuilding centres. In 2011, there were 70 active shipyards in Turkey, with another 56 being built. Turkish shipyards are highly regarded both {{for the production of}} chemical and oil tankers up to 10,000 dwt and also for their mega yachts.|$|E
5|$|A Master Plan {{adopted in}} 2000 {{called for the}} port to be {{transformed}} into a container port, which led to the purchase of the largest harbor crane in the state. In 2002, the Port District Commission took the lead in the development of Albany's Riverfront Park in the Corning Preserve as part of a development to enhance Albany's access to the river. The port helped in financing the project and in the construction of two bulkheads which have seasonal <b>floating</b> <b>docks</b> attached. In a 2005 audit, the Office of the State Comptroller questioned the port's involvement in the construction and financing. Two issues raised were the port district's lack of authority to build docks for non-commercial use and that the port would receive no income for facilities it was financing. The port received $3.3million in 2002 to upgrade and {{become a member of the}} Inland Distribution Network, a select group of ports that are used as satellite locations for the distribution of container cargo from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, resulting in less congestion at downstate ports and highways.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s, Estonia did {{not possess}} a dry dock {{large enough to}} {{accommodate}} the 3,619-ton Suur Tõll and as a result the icebreaker was drydocked in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1923. As a response, the Tallinn-based Riigi Laivatehas combined their 2,000-ton and 3,000-ton <b>floating</b> <b>docks</b> with pontoons. In 1927, the shipyard replaced Suur Tõlls old boilers with new ones purchased from Vulcan and heightened the bridge by one deck to improve visibility over the bow.|$|E

25|$|From the 1936 season a {{permanent}} {{location for the}} airport was needed. A key factor was the need to place it {{as close to the}} city center as possible. Tromsøysundet was selected as the runway and the docks and terminal were located at Dampskipkaien. DNL specified their needs and Tromsø Municipality built the airport after the specifications. The most costly part was a <b>floating</b> <b>docks,</b> which was built using twelve used oil drums. A barracks in the inner parts of the port was used as a terminal building.|$|E

During this period, she typically only carried half of her complement, usually consisting of a pair of reconnaissance aircraft and two fighters.|$|E
