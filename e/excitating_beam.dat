40|$|The Hanle {{effect is}} the {{modification}} {{by a local}} magnetic field of the polarization due to coherent scattering in spectral lines. It results from the precession of a classical oscillator about the magnetic field direction. The sophisticated quantum-mechanical treatment, which is required to compute the polarization parameters of scattered light, was developed. The main features of the Hanle effect concerning magnetic field measurements are: (1) a good sensitivity within the approximate range 0. 1 B gamma rho to 10 B gamma rho where B gamma rho is the field strength yielding a Larmor period equal to the radiative lifetime, (2) there is no Hanle effect for field vectors parallel to the <b>excitating</b> <b>beam,</b> (3) the Hanle effect refers essentially to the linear polarization in a spectral line, (4) various points in the line profile are affected {{in the same way}} by change of linear polarization so that polarization parameters can be measured on the integrated line profile...|$|E
