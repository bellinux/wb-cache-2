40|$|Heat {{treatment}} {{is widely used}} for high reliability fastening components such as buckles and brackets. The current study focuses on mass production of safety components which are fineblanked from sheet metal, austempered and chromium electroplated. Electroplating together with stamping defects may lead to unexpected brittle failure of the component. It is widely known that during austenitisation, <b>decarburisation</b> could avoid brittle failure and, therefore, slight <b>decarburisation</b> is recommended. There is little information how much mass production is influenced by <b>decarburisation</b> and where the limits are. The current study has two goals. The first one focuses {{on the extent of}} <b>decarburisation</b> effect on the part properties, and the second aims to find the optimum furnace setting for the product type used in the study. Also, it is necessary to choose a reliable <b>decarburisation</b> control method for austempered components. The effect on material grades was analyzed by using three steel alloys with carbon content of 0. 37  wt. %, 0. 47  wt. % and 0. 62  wt. %. The specimens were austempered to hardness 45 – 51  HRC under endothermic protective atmosphere. To gain different <b>decarburisation</b> levels, two gas set-ups were used. Infrared gas analyzer was used to measure CO and CO 2 content in the furnace gas. Three characteristics of the specimens were evaluated: hardness, rupture strength and brittleness. The depth of the <b>decarburisation</b> was determined by three different approaches according to standard EN ISO  3887. Based on the results, the spectrographic method is the most reliable for determining the depth of <b>decarburisation.</b> This study reveals that higher surface <b>decarburisation</b> has a positive effect on the ductility and no effect on the rupture strength of the component. The material with carbon content of 0. 62  wt. % is the most sensitive to <b>decarburisation.</b> During mass production, the inaccuracy of hardness measuring raises which results in the inaccuracy of salt bath temperature regulation. For the used thermal cycle, the furnace gas carbon potential 0. 30 – 0. 40 has to be used to ensure expected performance of fastening products. </span...|$|E

40|$|The 1970 ’s saw {{the demand}} for more fuel {{efficient}} vehicles. This necessitated lighter automobiles, and was partly attained by lowering {{the weight of the}} coil springs used for the suspensions of these vehicles. Substantial weight reductions were achieved with new steels such as SUP 7, with their elevated carbon and silicon contents allowing the springs to operate at higher stresses. However, these steels are prone to <b>decarburisation</b> during spring manufacture, which sharply reduces the sag resistance and the fatigue strength of the springs. The literature pertaining to the <b>decarburisation</b> of high silicon spring steels is limited, despite the subsequent reduced sag and fatigue properties. The research detailed in this thesis was therefore undertaken to investigate the <b>decarburisation</b> of spring steels with 0 to 3 wt. % silicon for a range of temperatures and heat treatment atmospheres. The austenitisation of these steels was also investigated to provide complementary information. Austenitisation and <b>decarburisation</b> heat treatments were undertaken with 0, 1 and 3 wt. % silicon experimental steels, and the commercially available 2 wt. % silicon SUP 7 and SUP 7 NV steels. These five steels have similar carbon, manganese and chromium contents. Two dimensional austenite growth occurred for the different steels, with the austenite grain shape inherited from the initial ferrite grain structure. The austenitisation accelerated with increasing temperature, with the higher silicon steels exhibiting faster transformation kinetics at comparable intercritical fractional superheat temperatures due to the higher Ac₁ and Ac₃ temperatures. The austenite growth was controlled by the substitutional diffusion of the alloy elements at low intercritical temperatures, and by carbon diffusion through the austenite at higher temperatures. This resulted in the faster transformation of ferrite/spheroidal cementite initial microstructures than pearlitic microstructures at low intercritical temperatures, and the opposite at higher temperatures. Austenite nucleated earlier in ferrite/spheroidal cementite initial microstructures when the cementite particles were located predominantly on the ferrite grain boundaries of the initial structures rather than within the ferrite grains. The austenite growth eventually became faster for the latter structure. An increasing silicon content up to 2 wt. % increased the rate of carbon removal at comparable temperatures. Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that the mass of carbon removed during <b>decarburisation</b> increased with silicon contents up to 2 wt. %, with temperature, and with PH₂O/PH₂ ratios of 0. 01 to 0. 25, while manganese decreased the <b>decarburisation.</b> However, slower <b>decarburisation</b> resulted for the 3 % Silicon steel, especially at higher temperatures and lower PH₂O/PH₂ ratios, where a dense oxide layer strongly inhibited carbon removal. The <b>decarburisation</b> of the 1 % Silicon, SUP 7 and SUP 7 NV steels was fastest at their respective Ac₃ temperatures. Columnar free ferrite grain structures were obtained for the 0 % Silicon and SUP 7 steels, compared with equiaxed grains for the 1 % Silicon, SUP 7 NV and 3 % Silicon steels. The <b>decarburisation</b> of SUP 7 was fastest when the specimen was heated in the furnace with the heat treatment atmosphere already established, while slower <b>decarburisation</b> resulted when the specimens were annealed in inert atmospheres prior to the introduction of the <b>decarburisation</b> atmosphere. Different initial SUP 7 microstructures influenced the carbon release kinetics as the specimens heated to temperature. Prolonged <b>decarburisation</b> of SUP 7 and SUP 7 NV at 900 °C yielded decreasing free ferrite depths after 4 hr, despite continued carbon removal from the steel.

Finite-element (FE) simulation was carried out to establish {{the link between the}} EM sensor output and the level of decarburization. Rail samples with different levels of <b>decarburisation,</b> due to different bloom reheat times prior to rolling were tested in the laboratory.

This finding is helpful in understanding the response of the EM sensor to rail <b>decarburisation</b> and could lead to a non-contact, non destructive method for use during rail manufacturing.

40|$|Vacuum {{metallurgical}} {{processes are}} necessary {{for the production of}} steel grades with high quality standards. Most steelplants use them for the final refining of liquid steel. Changing the thermodynamic equilibrium by an increase of the total pressure is the principle for <b>decarburisation</b> and degassing.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the effect of surface metallurgy on the rolling contact fatigue behaviour of rail. The investigation has used laboratory based rolling/sliding twin disc testing of samples with a surface metallurgical feature simulated on them. The samples used in laboratory testing have been compared with samples of rail removed from track. Two surface metallurgical features have been investigated: <b>decarburisation</b> and white etching layer. <b>Decarburisation</b> is the loss of carbon {{from the surface of the}} rail due to oxidation at high temperatures, resulting in a softer layer at the surface (180 HV compared to 250 HV bulk). The decarburised layer has been simulated in this research by heat treating discs in a laboratory furnace with an air atmosphere. The results show that by increasing the depth of <b>decarburisation</b> the growth rate of cracks within the sample, along with the wear rate, increases. At the maximum depth of <b>decarburisation</b> allowed on rail by the standard (O. 5 mm) there was little difference in the wear or rolling contact fatigue behaviour with or without <b>decarburisation.</b> White etching layer (WEL) forms on the surface of rail due to the action of the wheels and is a very hard layer (> 850 HV) up to 250 mm deep. White etching layer has been simulated in two ways: spot welding and gross sliding of the discs. The results have shown that cracks initiate preferentially at weak spots at the surface, such as the interface between the WEL and pearlite or along proeutectoid ferrite boundaries. It has been found that the growth of cracks below the surface depends on the strain history of the subsurface pearlite. The results indicate that white etching layer is detrimental to rail life through either the promotion of rolling contact fatigue and/or wear...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the <b>decarburisation</b> of liquid steel by oxide addition and inert atmosphere {{as an alternative}} to the conventional method of blowing oxygen and/or applying vacuum/stirring. Free energy calculations were used to determine the feasibility of oxide additions to form carbon monoxide as a reaction product. The following oxides, whose free energy reactions are negative, were selected for the initial examination: Fe 2 O 3, Fe 3 O 4, NiO, MgO, P 2 O 5, Bi 2 O 3, MnO 2, MgCO 3 and CaCO 3. Iron, nickel, phosphorous and manganese were chosen because the cations are typically present in steel and so their effects on steel quality would be predictable. Bismuth, magnesium and calcium are not common alloying elements in steel; however, these elements were selected because: (i) their free energies of reaction are highly negative, (ii) they are relatively inexpensive and (iii) their effects on steel quality had not been reported. The oxide addition was performed in two sets of experiments. The first set of experiments added 1 wt% oxide (an oxide per experiment) by using Fe 2 O 3, Fe 3 O 4, NiO, MgO, P 2 O 5 and Bi 2 O 3. The second set of experiments added 0 to 100 % of the stoichiometric amount of O that is required in forming CO, disregarding the initial O in the Fe powder (0. 2 wt%). The stoichiometric value was calculated for the <b>decarburisation</b> reaction of each oxide. The oxides used for the second set of experiments were Fe 2 O 3, Fe 3 O 4, P 2 O 5, Bi 2 O 3, MnO 2, MgCO 3 and CaCO 3. NiO and MgO were not used in the second set of experiments, where they were replaced by MnO 2, MgCO 3 and CaCO 3 to explore their <b>decarburisation</b> efficiency on the steel. The oxide additions were mixed to high-purity Fe powder (containing &# 8804; 0. 007 wt% C and &# 8804; 0. 200 wt% O) using rotary mixing at ~ 200 rpm for ~ 8 h, and instantaneous melting was at 1600 °C for 20 min under Ar (1 L/min). LECO® analysis, infrared analysis and video imaging showed that CO formation and evacuation were responsible for <b>decarburisation</b> to ultra-low C (ULC) levels. The optimum result was from the Fe 2 O 3 addition, giving a C level of 15. 7 ppm (0. 00157 wt%). The present work shows that ULC steels (&# 8804; 50 ppm) occur through a four-stage process: (a) oxide decomposition, (b) alloying elements and O addition, (c) <b>decarburisation</b> through CO formation and evacuation and (d) homogenisation through convective mixing by the gas. Therefore, the findings of this thesis can contribute to improving sustainable steelmaking <b>decarburisation</b> to ULC levels...|$|E

An anomaly was identified in the model of daughter bubble distribution available in the literature and rectified in the present study. Population balance modelling was used to track the number density of different bubble class. The <b>decarburisation</b> reaction with heat generation due to exothermic reaction was considered in the present study. The numerical prediction was based on Eulerian-Eulerian approach where the liquid phase was treated as a continuum and the gas phase (bubbles) was considered as a dispersed phase. A user subroutine was written in FORTRAN programming language to incorporate foam formation and destruction, bubble interactions and <b>decarburisation</b> into the main CFD software. The simulated results from the CFD models were validated against the experimental data available in the open literature...|$|E

So far only few opportunities of looking into an industrial-scale MIM furnace have been developed. By connecting a mass spectrometer to the exhaust system of a batch furnace, {{we are able to}} show for the first time what is going on during the debinding and sintering cycle. In this work, the processing of carbonyl iron parts from reduced carbonyl iron powder under neutral and reducing atmospheres was monitored. The spectra show the temperatures and conditions for carburisation and <b>decarburisation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Heating in a 100 kW {{plasma furnace}} {{equipped}} with an arc plasma torch and an anode embedded cool crucible {{made it possible for}} pronounced <b>decarburisation,</b> deoxidation, and reducing the sulphur content in a low-carbon steel, ČSN 41 2013. A prerequisite for successful refining by argon–oxygen or argon–hydrogen plasma is a clean, slag-free surface in the bath. In the case of critical carbon content, an argon–oxygen plasma can contribute to the substantial acceleration of the deoxidation reaction. The values of sulphur content reduction attained are interesting. This above is also applicable to the refining of alloyed and stainless chrome steels...|$|E
40|$|Lining {{the inner}} {{surface of a}} cast iron {{hydraulic}} cylinder with copper alloy would generally not be possible. In this study, {{the surface of a}} cast iron cylinder was decarburised by high temperature oxidation. The cylinder, after <b>decarburisation,</b> was filled with borax anhydride and heated at a temperature of 1203 K. Molten copper alloy was then injected into the cylinder, displacing the molten borax anhydride. After cooling, the embedded copper alloy was drilled along its centre axis so that a prescribed thickness of the copper alloy remained. Thus, the cast iron cylinder could be successfully lined with copper alloy...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a concept to utilise Carbon-dioxide for Steel-Making {{and would like}} to name it after the first author as OSRAM-CO$_ 2 $-SM process. We found in our lab {{experiments}} that the carbon content in high-carbon ferro-chrome metallic powders has come down from 7 % to 1 % when pure CO$_ 2 $ gas with partial pressure of 1 atmosphere is passed through a horizontal retort furnace maintained at 1100 $^o$ C for 24 hours. Our results clearly demonstrated that <b>decarburisation</b> can be very effective, when CO$_ 2 $ is used at temperatures where it is unstable and the Boudouard reaction which is endothermic in nature is more favoured. Based on these findings, we propose the OSRAM-CO$_ 2 $-SM process in which CO$_ 2 $ shall be used as the decarburising agent. CO$_ 2 $ is to be passed into a specially designed converter provided with heating mechanism to maintain the contents from blast furnace in a molten state for <b>decarburisation</b> of the melt. The out coming hot gases consisting of CO has to be burnt in a combustion chamber with stochiometric proportions of pure O$_ 2 $ to produce CO$_ 2 $ at a partial pressure close to 1 atm. The process will be extremely useful as it involves reuse and recycle of CO$_ 2 $ and in turn would reduce the overall amount of CO$_ 2 $ discharged into the atmosphere.

40|$|The {{supersonic}} jet {{generated by}} a Laval nozzle in air or in steel has been modelled to vary degrees of complexity and with different goals. 1, 2) This paper describes the application of our model to an injection system based on fixed lances, placed in the furnace walls {{without the help of}} CFD simulation, which is certainly very precise, but very time consuming and useless for an on line control. The approach followed here is energy-based and it allows estimating the depth reached by the O 2 during its penetration within the slag and steel. It can be used for an on line control and for the whole description of the injection process. The calculation of a theoretical interface surface allows investigating the chemical process and the mass transport phenomena induced by the injection itself. This simulation can be used to investigate the required injection parameters to ensure the maximum mass exchange with the bath and to foresee new injection technologies performances. Moreover, this model of the supersonic injection allows the construction of a <b>decarburisation</b> model that can evaluate the effects and the efficiency of the injection technology. This article describes the jet-penetration model and the <b>decarburisation</b> model. The validation of the model has been performed by the comparison with the experimental data of the Tenaris-Dalmine EAF and the KT Supersonic Injection System (the chemical package of Techint Technologies for the multi-point injection of oxygen, carbon and other fines into the EAF) ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the time required for the diffusion of carbon out of supersaturated sub-units of ferrite into the retained austenite. The analytical model estimates the <b>decarburisation</b> time of the sub-units of supersaturated bainitic ferrite. The purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate how a thermodynamic method can be used for solving a problem of the <b>decarburisation</b> of bainite subunits and carbon diffusion distances in the matrix of ADI. This should in principle enable to examine the partitioning of carbon from supersaturated ferrite plates into adjacent austenite and the carbon content in retained austenite using analytical method. The diffusion coefficient of carbon in austenite is very sensitive to the carbon concentration and this has {{to be taken into account}} in treating the large concentration gradients that develop in the austenite. The results are discussed in the context of displacive mechanism of bainite transformation. Experimental measurements of volume fraction of bainitic ferrite and volume of the untransformed austenite indicate that there is a necessity of carbides precipitation from austenite. The necessary carbon diffusion distance in austenite also illustrates that the estimated time is not capable of decarburising the ferrite subunits during the period of austempering. A consequence of the precipitation of cementite from austenite during austempering is that the growth of bainitic ferrite can continue to larger extent and that the resulting microstructure is not an ausferrite but is a mixture of bainitic ferrite, retained austenite and carbides...|$|E

The influences of individual elements on {{the properties of}} solution of nitrogen in the metal bath, {{on the process of}} nitrogen dissolution in connection with <b>decarburisation</b> process and also influences of some important factors on the possibilities of nitrogen regulation during the refining period were investigated in this work.

One {{of the most}} serious problems in BOF operations was lance skulling, hood jamming, and build-up of metal in the mouth and cone of the furnace due to spitting and slopping. As spitting occurring during blowing increases, these particles of metal are deposited inside the mouth and cone and affect badly BOF productivity. In the present work, control of spitting has been established by addition of sinter during the period of spitting.
