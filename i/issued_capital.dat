On 1 October 1975 the Statutory Company created a further 24,000 new shares, bringing its <b>issued</b> <b>capital</b> up to £75,000 in £1 shares. The PLC subscribed for 23,950 of these new shares and the remaining 50 were acquired by {{a director of the}} Statutory Company in order to bring their holding up to the minimum for directors of 250 shares specified in the 1926 Light Railway Order. Directors' shareholdings in the Statutory Company are subject to rights of pre-emption by the PLC and are therefore treated for most purposes as being owned by that company.|$|E

2500|$|The 1901 meeting {{authorised}} {{a dividend}} payment of 6% {{and the issue}} of 2,746 shares at £10 each in order to aid investment in plant and extended premises for the purpose of manufacturing [...] "high-speed engines". This issue of shares amounted to 20% of the then <b>issued</b> <b>capital,</b> and they were taken up by existing shareholders. In the same year the company considerably extended its Knott Mill factory, at which time a visitor noted in particular the work in progress on [...] "several exceptionally large engines for iron and steel works" [...] (one had a 45 ton, 24 foot diameter flywheel and a total weight of 230 tons) and also a wood treatment plant for the Northern Wood Haskinising Company (haskinising was a wood preservation technique). There were reports at this time that the company had licensed and was developing Pictet's discovery of an improved method for the production of oxygen gas, although there were suggestions that this may have been as part of a syndicate involving other Manchester businesses. The plan was for Pictet to experiment further at the Galloway works and if the outcome was successful then a new company would be formed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1910, King's Pacific Sunset Oil Company, {{which he}} re-named and {{incorporated}} the Boston Pacific Oil Company in March 2010 (see below), brought a suit before United States circuit court on 23 December for an injunction to restrain Charles W. Gregg of Colorado, U.S. Waugh, W. Newburg, Morris Newberger, F.A. Cromwell, C.M. Webb, Adeline Webb, U.E. Methaver, {{and several other}} of Gregg's associates living in California from disposing of 200,000 shares of the oil company's stock, valued at $1 a share at the time, which, it was alleged, was secured by the defendants through [...] "trickery and fraud." [...] Gregg and the other defendants held 200,000 shares of the 219,965 shares of the <b>issued</b> <b>capital</b> stock of the Pacific Sunset oil company. [...] It is said {{that in order to}} trade off the 200,000 shares of the Pacific Sunset stock for an equal amount in the Boston Pacific company, Gregg and the other defendants, among other things, filled an oil reservoir on the Pacific Sunset oil company's fifty acres of leased land in Kern county, which contained 3,400 barrels of oil, with water so as to make it appear that the reservoir held between 25,000 to 30,000 barrels of oil. [...] When negotiations began, Gregg and his associates asserted there were four wells on the property each of which was producing 70 barrels of oil per day; and that the total liabilities of the Pacific Sunset Oil Company, which it was proposed that BPOC should take over, did not exceed $10,000; that the sump contained between 25,000 and 30,000 barrels of oil and that the company had an option to purchase the leased land for $80,000 ($2 million in 2016). The complaint stated that each of the four wells produced only 17 to 20 barrels of actual oil the day of the investigation when inspected by a representative of Fillius, and that the wells had not been worked for some period previous to the time they were inspected, so that the 70 barrels pumped [...] "the day of" [...] the investigation was actually the accumulation of several days of pumping; that the sump contained only 3,600 barrels of oil, not 25,000-30,000 (the remainder of the fluid in the reserves being water poured in by the defendants); and that the company held no option to purchase the land they had leased for $80,000. [...] The complaint also indicated that the liabilities of the Pacific Sun Oil Company amounted to $23,304. Another charge contained in the complaint was the Gregg said the Pacific Sunset company had an agreement with the Independent Oil Producers' agency whereby the latter agreed to take all the oil the former should sell at $0.55 ($13.50 in 2016) a barrel, whereas no such agreement existed.|$|E

30|$|The {{explanatory}} {{variables in}} Column (1) of Table  5 {{show that the}} proxies for liquidity needs and growth opportunities, market access, asymmetric information, and capital regulation maintain their sign and statistical significance. However, the coefficient for Issuer Capital Instruments in t- 1 to t- 3 is now positive and statistically significant with a similar magnitude as the coefficients of the two variables for Issuer Hybrid Instruments. This result indicates that even when the decision to <b>issue</b> <b>capital</b> and debt are not mutually dependent (Tables  3, 4), once the bank has decided to <b>issue</b> <b>capital</b> instruments in the near past, this decision provides a capital buffer that enables the bank to issue an amount of debt even {{higher than in the}} case of not having issued. Furthermore, Issuer in Past becomes statistically significant, in line with the predictions. Overall, we can claim that the determinants of the issuance of debt present similarly qualitative effects in the extensive and the intensive margins.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} simple {{hypothesis}} that when companies <b>issue</b> more <b>capital,</b> {{they have a}} tendency to select the type of capital, all other things being equal, which results in the higher short-term earnings per share (eps).

The results lead us to conclude that there is evidence in <b>capital</b> <b>issues</b> of functional fixation on eps. Earnings Per Share Functional Fixation <b>Capital</b> <b>Issues,...</b>|$|R
