5|$|Robert was {{probably}} one of the sons of <b>Gilbert</b> de Gant, who is mentioned in the Domesday Book. <b>Gilbert</b> was from Flanders and came to England during 1069. <b>Gilbert,</b> who died around 1095, was married to Alice, daughter of Hugh de Montfort. Robert's conjectured siblings were Emma– wife of Alan de Percy, Hugh de Montfort-sur-Risle, <b>Gilbert</b> de Gant– who died before his father, and Walter de Gant. If Robert was a son of <b>Gilbert,</b> he was a younger son, probably the youngest of the four brothers, and probably was born sometime around 1085, as his supposed parents married about 1075 and there were older siblings. Robert is often confused in the historical records with another Robert, son of Walter. Robert {{was probably}} also the uncle of <b>Gilbert</b> de Gant, later Earl of Lincoln.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, <b>Gilbert</b> and Sullivan were {{suddenly}} in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of Thespis for the 1875 Christmas season, which <b>Gilbert</b> and Sullivan would have revised, but {{he was unable to}} obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that <b>Gilbert</b> and Sullivan create another one-act opera on the theme of burglars, but this was never completed.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, there were discussions towards {{reviving}} Thespis, but <b>Gilbert</b> and Sullivan {{were not able to}} agree on terms with Carte and his backers. The score to Thespis was never published, and most of the music is now lost. It took some time for Carte to gather funds for another <b>Gilbert</b> and Sullivan opera, and in this gap <b>Gilbert</b> produced several works including Tom Cobb (1875), Eyes and No Eyes (1875, his last German Reed Entertainment), and Princess Toto (1876), his last and most ambitious work with Clay, a three-act comic opera with full orchestra, as opposed to the shorter works for much reduced accompaniment that came before. <b>Gilbert</b> also wrote two serious works during this time, Broken Hearts (1875) and Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith (1876).|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1871, the {{impresario}} John Hollingshead commissioned Sullivan to {{work with}} W. S. <b>Gilbert</b> to create the burlesque-style comic opera Thespis for the Gaiety Theatre. Played as a Christmas entertainment, it ran through to Easter 1872, a good run for such a piece. After Thespis, <b>Gilbert</b> and Sullivan went their separate ways until they collaborated on three parlour ballads in late 1874 and early 1875.|$|E

5|$|By {{this time}} <b>Gilbert</b> faced {{financial}} difficulty {{as an amateur}} cricketer. Most amateurs were from privileged backgrounds, whereas professionals mainly came from the working class. It was almost unthinkable for an amateur to become a professional, although many did receive financial inducements such as generous expenses and sinecure positions within county organisations. Unlike the Grace brothers, <b>Gilbert</b> {{did not have a}} profession outside cricket to provide a supplementary income allowing him to live comfortably. A solution seemed to arrive in 1880, when Fred Grace, the manager of the United South of England XI touring side and one of W. G. Grace's brothers, died and <b>Gilbert</b> took over his paid job as secretary. But the popularity of professional touring teams was already in decline, and the increasing number of matches between county teams attracted more interest. An indication of trouble came in 1882 when a professional cricketer took <b>Gilbert</b> to court over unpaid fees for an appearance in a match.|$|E

5000|$|In 1994, D'Virgilio joined Kevin <b>Gilbert's</b> {{reformed}} band Giraffe for a one-off {{performance of}} the Genesis piece [...] "The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway" [...] at Progfest '94. In 1995, he performed drums as part of <b>Gilbert's</b> touring band, Thud, which recorded a live album, Live at the Troubadour, released in 1999. After <b>Gilbert's</b> death in 1996, D'Virgilio was asked by <b>Gilbert's</b> estate to complete his second solo album, The Shaming of the True, based on the extant tapes and <b>Gilbert's</b> notes. Shaming was released posthumously in 2000 and has D'Virgilio on many tracks contributing drums, percussion, bass, guitar, keyboards and backing vocals. In November 2002, D'Virgilio headlined Progwest in Claremont, California and played the entire The Shaming of the True album live in a band consisting of other friends and colleagues of <b>Gilbert's.</b> In 2008, video tapes of the Troubadour concert were uncovered for the first time, leading to a DVD, entitled Welcome to Joytown - Thud Live at The Troubadour, released in 2009.|$|R

50|$|The red-lored {{whistler}} is similar, in many respects, to <b>Gilbert's</b> whistler, {{to which}} it is closely related, and from which it must be distinguished: the range of the red-lored whistler falls entirely within that of the <b>Gilbert's</b> whistler. The two species share the same habitat, behaviour and even many calls. John Gould, who described both species, was not familiar with the <b>Gilbert's</b> whistler: this is surprising, as the path that he travelled took him through areas where the <b>Gilbert's</b> whistler is not uncommon. It is possible that, in the absence of specimens, even Gould confused the two species.|$|R

Before {{the first of the}} four {{performances of}} Trial, a specially written curtain raiser by William Douglas-Home, called Dramatic Licence, was played by Peter Pratt as Carte, Kenneth Sandford as <b>Gilbert</b> and John Ayldon as Sullivan, in which <b>Gilbert,</b> Sullivan and Carte plan the birth of Trial in 1875. Trial by Jury was eliminated from the D'Oyly Carte repertory in 1976 as a cost-saving measure.|$|E
