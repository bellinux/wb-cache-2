50|$|The Savoy Hotel {{opened in}} 1913. At that time, the {{original}} five-storey building {{had the most}} up-to-date equipment of the time, such as <b>elevators,</b> <b>telephones</b> in the rooms, and safes. Among the famous hotel guests were Sergey Yesenin, Isadora Duncan, and Antoine de Saint Exupéry. Moscow literati en masse honored the hotel with their presence, reading their new poems there. After the Russian Revolution and World War II the Savoy remained a main attraction {{for the children of}} the Communist elite.|$|R
5000|$|Cheever {{was paralyzed}} from his waist down {{at an early}} age. As an adult he weighed only [...] {{and had to be}} carried around by an assistant.

50|$|The Heryford Brothers Building is {{a three-story}} Classical Revival style {{structure}} with 54000 ft2 m2 of interior floor space. It {{was designed by}} San Francisco architect F. S. DeLongchamp, and constructed by I. A. (Andy) Underwood, a prominent Lakeview builder. When it was opened, the first floor was occupied by the Lakeview Mercantile Company, Lakeview’s post office, and the Hall and Reynolds drug store. The United States Land Office and the local Elks Lodge occupied the second floor with professional offices on the third floor. The building included many features that were considered very modern, especially in an isolated eastern Oregon community in the early 20th century. These features included an electric power generator, central stream heat, <b>elevators,</b> <b>telephones,</b> electric lights, and hot water throughout the building.|$|R

40|$|Hotels {{have always}} been quick to adopt {{emerging}} technology; last century it was <b>elevators,</b> <b>telephones</b> and television, today it is wi-fi, ipad docks and adult movies. Through two focus groups of hotel managers, three scenarios were explored: the extinction of existing technology in the known future (next 10 years), the adoption of emerging new technology {{in the foreseeable future}} (10 - 20 years) and in the far future (20 + years) the emergence of advance technology, particularly in the provision of robots. The study explored the likelihood of robots providing {{a more active role in}} hotels in the future, by undertaking functions such as front office services, but it also investigated possible future use of sexual service robots, and the challenges this will present to hotel managers. The study concluded that service robots in hotels might become common, while the provision of sexual service robots will be a niche market, constrained by the norms of society...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the last}} half of the 19th century, Rallet {{continued}} to expand. Dependence on foreign suppliers was reduced through the acquisition of plantations in southern Russia for the cultivation of aromatic crops. A new factory was planned at Butyrskaya under the direction of the celebrated architect Oscar-Jean (Franzevich) DiDio. Completed in 1899, this factory featured the latest technology including steam engines, electricity, an <b>elevator,</b> and <b>telephone</b> service.|$|R

60|$|Grace did {{not like}} Canada. Her {{cultivation}} was artificial, but Canada was primitive and stern. In the towns, one found inventions that lightened labor, and brought to the reach of all a physical comfort that in England only the rich enjoyed, but the contrasts were sharp. One left one's hotel, with its very modern furniture, noisy <b>elevators</b> and <b>telephones,</b> and plunged into the wilderness where all was {{as it had been}} from the beginning. Grace shrank from primitive rudeness and hated adventure. Living by rule she distrusted all she did not know. She thought it strange that Barbara, who feared nothing, let her go in front.|$|R

50|$|The Village of Champion {{received}} its charter on May 27, 1911, {{and the first}} council meeting was held in June. The growing village required ever more services, and soon Champion was home to its first grain <b>elevator</b> (1912), a <b>telephone</b> office, a school (1913), recreational facilities, and an ever-growing number of retail shops and businesses. A local newspaper, The Champion Chronicle, was also started in 1918 or 1919, and remained in print until 1943.|$|R
60|$|The vicar’s {{faith was}} warranted, for while Violet Wayne was driven home that evening with her {{thoughts}} in a whirl, and a remorseful tenderness which overlooked the dead man’s shortcomings bringing a mist to her eyes, Appleby sat under the electric lights {{in a room}} of a great New York building. He felt the pulsations of a vast activity about him, for the thick doors and maple partitions could not shut out the whir of the <b>elevators,</b> tinkle of <b>telephone</b> bells, murmur of voices, and patter of hasty feet, though his eyes were on the agreement bond he was attaching his name to.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{accessibility}} to public buildings for wheelchair users in Al Ain, the fourth largest city of the United Arab Emirates. Method: Data were collected at 17 buildings, randomly chosen using the local telephone book as source. The instrument used was a survey form covering eight accessibility areas: parking, ramps, entrances, accessible routes, toilets, <b>elevators,</b> public <b>telephones</b> and water fountains. The survey comprized 79 items based on the Americans with Disabilities Act Guidelines (ADAAG). Results: The highest overall compliance scored was 73 %, and the lowest was 13 %. The highest compliant accessibility area was accessible route with a mean of 76 %, and the lowest was parking with a mean of 19 %. None of the buildings recorded 100 % compliance with the items in the survey form. Conclusions: A wheelchair user would have encountered many and difficult architectural barriers if he had visited any of the public sites surveyed in the city of Al Ain. the results of this study show that much has actually been accomplished in the field of wheelchair accessibility of public buildings in the UAE city of Al Ain, despite the absence of legislation. This study could be seen as an example of what happens when the modern urban environment evolves in a non regulated context, lacking legislation protecting and ensuring the accessibility for the wheelchair bound member of society...|$|R

5000|$|The tall free {{standing}} tower {{was designed to}} be and became an important landmark. On each side of the building the owners advertised their name. The faded remains of the logos for [...] "E.C.Simmons - Keen Kutter" [...] and the subsequent owners [...] "Harwi" [...] can still be seen today (2013). The tower's more practical purpose was to hold [...] of water that could be delivered to sprinklers on each of the four floors {{in the event of a}} fire. This was a modern purpose-built building that is estimated to have cost $250,000 at the time of its construction. The design included electric <b>elevators,</b> an internal <b>telephone</b> system and messenger call boxes. An unusual part of the design was the offices, which were situated to maximize their use of natural light. These offices were placed in a 17 ft wide strip that stretched 150 ft along the south side of the first (ground level) and second stories. On the ground floor was a sample room where the company's goods were displayed and a room with easy chairs that was available to both customers and employees. The Simmons company designed their buildings for efficiency and were known to employ the leading time and motion pioneer Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.|$|R

P. Motley, President of the Hospital and Health Board, out of concern for public inconvenience• Liberty Loan mass meetings will be included in the ban, but Liberty Loan luncheons will still be permitted as a military necessity; Liberty Loan workers have assured the health board that all precautions will be taken• The order closing public schools has not yet been made official by the school board, bu every member of the board said that they will act immediately upon notification from the health board; D.

Goodley, Chief of Police, has been notified of the orders• Saloons and cabarets will not be closed as a class, but rather inspectors will watch such places and closed them if they are “found to be a menace”• The order was issued at a meeting at the Chamber of Commerce, attended by the health board, members of the school board, representatives of the army motor schools, and members of the Jackson County Medical Society; the health board unanimously favored the order• At the meeting, Bullock outlined the history of influenza in the city, including a per diem report of new cases; he explained that most cases were reported at rooming houses and the health board devoted most of their attention to ventilating and disinfecting these places• Capt. A. V. Hobbs, medical officer for the army schools, recommended the ban on public gatherings; he said that influenza is crowd disease and that medical care is a poor preventive; he argued that reported cases represent only a third of the cases in the city and the majority are light cases walking around the city infecting other people; he suggested that half of all people are likely immune, but that 15 percent of influenza cases develop into pneumonia which has a 50 % mortality rate• Dr. R. E. Castelaw similarly advised the closing of all public gatherings, saying that 80 % of the cases were likely going about on the streets, to shows and churches• Dr. Motley, president of the health board, also appealed to the Chamber of Commerce to assist the health board financially; Acting Mayor F.
