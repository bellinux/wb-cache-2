40|$|We {{present the}} first 7. 5 'x 11. 5 ' velocity-resolved {{map of the}} [CII] 158 um line toward the Orion {{molecular}} cloud- 1 (OMC- 1) taken with the Herschel/HIFI instrument. In combination with far-infrared (FIR) photometric images and velocity-resolved maps of the H 41 alpha hydrogen recombination and CO J= 2 - 1 lines, this data set provides an unprecedented view of the intricate small-scale kinematics of the ionized/PDR/molecular gas interfaces and of the radiative feedback from massive stars. The main contribution to the [CII] luminosity (~ 85 %) is from the extended, FUV-illuminated face of the cloud G_ 0 > 500, n_H> 5 x 10 ^ 3 cm^- 3) and from dense PDRs (G_ 0 ~ 10 ^ 4, n_H~ 10 ^ 5 cm^- 3) at the interface between OMC- 1 and the HII region surrounding the Trapezium cluster. Around 15 % of the [CII] emission arises from a different gas component without CO counterpart. The [CII] excitation, PDR gas turbulence, line opacity (from [13 CII]) and role of the geometry of the illuminating stars {{with respect to the}} cloud are investigated. We construct maps of the [CII]/FIR and FIR/M_Gas ratios and show that [CII]/FIR decreases from the extended cloud component (10 ^- 2 - 10 ^- 3) to the more opaque star-forming cores (10 ^- 3 - 10 ^- 4). The lowest values are reminiscent of the "[CII] deficit" seen in local ultra-luminous IR galaxies hosting vigorous star formation. Spatial correlation analysis shows that the decreasing [CII]/FIR ratio correlates better with the column density of dust through the molecular cloud than with FIR/M_Gas. We conclude that the [CII] <b>emitting</b> <b>column</b> relative to the total dust column along each line of sight is responsible for the observed [CII]/FIR variations through the cloud.

50|$|In 1902 Quetzaltenango {{suffered}} {{a number of}} serious earthquakes. An earthquake struck on 18 April 1902, with its epicentre within the Santa María volcano. This {{was followed by a}} major eruption of the volcano from 24 to 26 October of the same year. The volcano <b>emitted</b> a massive <b>column</b> of ash, provoking a fierce lightning storm. The explosions emitted by the volcano were audible up to 160 km away. The government of Manuel Estrada Cabrera initially denied that the eruption had taken place in Guatemala, instead claiming that it had occurred in neighbouring Mexico. Although the eruption caused great loss of life in western Guatemala, the Guatemalan government downplayed its severity.|$|R

Results from observations {{of a dozen}} sources at centimeter and submillimeter wavelengths are presented. The two data sets are consistent, but do not constrain the excitation conditions in the ND 3 <b>emitting</b> gas. The <b>column</b> density ratios of NH 3 /NH 2 D, NH 2 D/ND 2 H and ND 3 /ND 2 H, observed in similar sized beams, are ≈ 10, and present a challenge for both the gas-phase and the grain-surface chemistry scenarios of deuterium fractionation. The role of shocks and of CO depletion in deuterium chemistry is discussed. Key words: ISM: molecules – ISM: abundances 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{recent years}} several {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} to measure and monitor the pollution of the air. Among these techniques, remote sensing using optical methods stands out due to several advantages for air quality control applications. A Passive Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy system that uses the ultraviolet region from 200 to 355 nm of the solar radiation is presented. The developed system is portable; therefore it is practical for real time and in situ measurements. The enhanced wavelength range of the system is intended to detect the ultraviolet light penetration in the Mexican Valley considering the solar zenith angle and the altitude. The system was applied to retrieve atmospheric SO 2 <b>columns</b> <b>emitted</b> either by anthropogenic (power plant) or natural sources (volcano), reaching a detection limit of about 1 ppm. The measurement of the penetrating solar radiation on the earth surface at the UVC range is presented and the possibility to measure pollution traces of some contaminants as O 3, NO 2 and aromatic compounds in real time and in situ in the ultraviolet region is discussed. </p...|$|R
60|$|It {{was nearly}} twelve o'clock when they topped a {{treeless}} ridge {{and came in}} sight of the round-up. Below them, {{in the midst of}} a wide, grassy river flat, stood several tents and a covered wagon. Nearby lay a strong circular corral of poplar logs filled with steers. At some distance from the corral a dense mass of slowly revolving cattle moved, surrounded by watching horsemen. Down from the hills and up the valley came other horsemen, hurrying forward irregular bands of cows and calves. A small fire near the corral was sending up a pale strand of smoke, and at the tail of the wagon a stovepipe, <b>emitting</b> a darker <b>column,</b> told that dinner was in preparation. Over the scene the cloudless September sky arched. Dust arose under the heels of the herds, and the bawling roar of bulls, the call of agonized cows, and the answering bleat of calves formed the base of the shrill whoopings and laughter of the men. Nothing could be wilder, more stirring, more picturesque, except a camp of Sioux or Cheyennes in the days of the buffalo.|$|R
40|$|We present arcsecond-scale mid-ir {{photometry}} (in the 10. 5 micron N {{band and}} at 24. 8 microns), and low resolution spectra in the N band (R~ 100) {{of a candidate}} high mass protostellar object (HMPO) in IRAS 18151 - 1208 and of two HMPO candidates in IRAS 20343 + 4129, IRS 1 and IRS 3. In addition we present high resolution mid-ir spectra (R~ 80000) of the two HMPO candidates in IRAS 20343 + 4129. These data are fitted with simple models to estimate the masses {{of gas and dust}} associated with the mid-ir <b>emitting</b> clumps, the <b>column</b> densities of overlying absorbing dust and gas, the luminosities of the HMPO candidates, and the likely spectral type of the HMPO candidate for which [Ne II] 12. 8 micron emission was detected (IRAS 20343 + 4129 IRS 3). We suggest that IRAS 18151 - 1208 is a pre-ultracompact HII region HMPO, IRAS 20343 + 4129 IRS 1 is an embedded young stellar object with the luminosity of a B 3 star, and IRAS 20343 + 4129 IRS 3 is a B 2 ZAMS star that has formed an ultracompact HII region and disrupted its natal envelope.

40|$|We {{construct}} {{models of}} molecular clouds {{that are considered}} as ensembles of transient cores. Each core is assumed to develop in the background gas of the cloud, grow to high density and decay into the background. The chemistry in each core responds to the dynamical state of the gas and to the gas-dust interaction. Ices are deposited on the dust grains in the core’s dense phase, and this material is returned to the gas as the core expands to low density. The cores of the ensemble number typically one thousand and are placed randomly in position within the cloud, and are assigned a random evolutionary phase. The models are used to generate molecular line contour maps of a typical dark cloud. These maps are found to represent extremely well the characteristic features of observed maps of the dark cloud L 673, which has been observed at both low and high resolutions. The computed maps are found to exhibit the general morphology of the observed maps, and to generate similar sizes of <b>emitting</b> regions, molecular <b>column</b> densities, and the separations between peaks of emissions of various molecular species. The models give insight {{into the nature of}} molecular clouds and the dynamical processes occurring within them, and significantly constrain dynamical and chemical processes in the interstellar medium...|$|R
40|$|The Infrared Radiometer for Millimetre Astronomy (IRMA) is a compact, {{relatively}} low cost, 20 5 m water vapour monitor. By carefully choosing a 2 5 m band that contains only water vapour molecule transitions {{it is possible}} to use a simple infrared detector chip to measure the total flux <b>emitted</b> by a <b>column</b> of atmosphere and hence, via an atmospheric model, to determine the total precipitable water vapour. Since February 2005, an IRMA has been measuring precipitable water vapour levels in Chile at the Gemini South site on Cerro Pachon with a second unit added at the nearby Las Campanas observatories site in August 2005. In early 2006 data collection started with three new build IRMA units at three locations for the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) project site testing effort. Additionally, an IRMA unit {{is in the process of}} being modified to prepare it for operations at Dome C in Antarctica as an addition to the suite of instruments on the University of New South Wales' AASTINO site monitoring facility. We present here a description of the features of the TMT IRMA units that enable them to run in a remote, unattended location in the Chilean desert that are relevant to the similarly remote Dome C operations. In addition we describe the modifications that have been undertaken and that are currently being tested in order to enable the units to operate with minimal redesign at the extremely low Antarctic winter temperatures.

40|$|International audienceContext. Magnetic cataclysmic {{variables}} are close binary systems containing a strongly magnetized white dwarf that accretes matter coming from an M-dwarf companion. The high magnetic field strength {{leads to the}} formation of an accretion column instead of an accretion disk. High-energy radiation coming from those objects is <b>emitted</b> from the <b>column</b> close to the white dwarf photosphere at the impact region. Its properties depend on the characteristics of the white dwarf and an accurate accretion column model allows the properties of the binary system to be inferred, such as the white dwarf mass, its magnetic field, and the accretion rate. Aims. We study the temporal and spectral behaviour of the accretion region and use the tools we developed to accurately connect the simulation results to the X-ray and optical astronomical observations. Methods. The radiation hydrodynamics code Hades was adapted to simulate this specific accretion phenomena. Classical approaches were used to model the radiative losses of the two main radiative processes: bremsstrahlung and cyclotron. Synthetic light curves and X-ray spectra were extracted from numerical simulations. A fast Fourier analysis was performed on the simulated light curves. The oscillation frequencies and amplitudes in the X-ray and optical domains are studied to compare those numerical results to observational ones. Different dimensional formulae were developed to complete the numerical evaluations. Results. The complete characterization of the emitting region is described for the two main radiative regimes: when only the bremsstrahlung losses and when both cyclotron and bremsstrahlung losses are considered. The effect of the non-linear cooling instability regime on the accretion column behaviour is analysed. Variation in luminosity on short timescales (~ 1 s quasi-periodic oscillations) is an expected consequence of this specific dynamic. The importance of secondary shock instability on the quasi-periodic oscillation phenomenon is discussed. The stabilization effect of the cyclotron process is confirmed by our numerical simulations, as well as the power distribution in the various modes of oscillation...|$|R
