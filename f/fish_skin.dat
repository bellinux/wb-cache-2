25|$|Fish (neqa sg neqek dual neqet pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik neqa or iqallug in Cup'ig) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common Yup'ik foods. Fish skins (neqet amiit or amirak ~ amiraq in Yup'ik) and {{intestines}} are used for waterproof clothing (amiragglugaq) in a few areas, especially in southern coastal Alaska. For example, commercial herring fishers from Toksook Bay, Alaska still prefer intestine parkas to heavy-duty raincoats, as they are lighter and allow body vapor to pass through the skin membrane while preventing rain from entering. In former times, rather crudely made shirts without hoods were made of local salmon or trout skins. Through rarely used today, in the past <b>fish</b> <b>skin</b> was also used for waterproof boots (amirak ~ amiraq) and mittens (arilluk) also parka (qasperrluk), making these items water-repellent and durable. <b>Fish</b> <b>skin</b> was also used to make parkas, mittens, and pants for summer use.

25|$|Fish-skin boots (amirak ~ amiraq sg amiriik dual in Yup'ik and Cup'ik) are {{waterproof}} skin boot made of <b>fish</b> <b>skin.</b> In {{the past}} fish-skin boots {{were made with}} depilated soles of bearded seal, ankle straps, and a casing sewb to the upper edge of the leg. Large salmon skins were prepared for boots by sewing up the fin holes. A round needle was used because a triangular needle would split the skin.|$|E
50|$|They {{were said}} to be dressed in <b>fish</b> <b>skins.</b> They may have been nomadic, staying in the marshy {{lowlands}} in the winter and the mountains during the summer. The burial was by exposure in trees.|$|R

25|$|Wastefulness being disrespectful, Yup'ik elders {{made use}} of every last scrap from hunts and harvests: seal guts, skins of salmon fish, dried grasses such as Leymus mollis (coarse {{seashore}} grass). Traditionally, skins of birds, fish, and marine mammals such as seal and walrus, and land mammals were used to make clothing. Hunting clothes were designed to be insulated and waterproof. <b>Fish</b> <b>skin</b> and marine mammal intestines (guts) were used for waterproof shells (as gut parka) and boots. Dried grass was used to make insulating socks, and as a waterproof thread.|$|E
25|$|Wrist-length mittens {{used to be}} {{commonly}} made of seal or caribou {{skin with}} the fur and the rough edge of the seam on the outside. Sealskin mittens were frequently made from leftover pieces of skin after boots were cut from them. The back and palm were separate pieces and the thumb one piece; gloves were unknown. Women wore fur mittens reaching nearly to the elbow with wolverine trim along the upper edge. Mittens of silver salmon skins which reached to the elbow were worn by men when hunting in a kayak in spring. The fish were cut down the back and the belly skins used for mittens. These sometimes were lined with grass or had grass mittens, woven all in one piece, inside; often they had a border of bleached sealskin. The combination of <b>fish</b> <b>skin</b> mittens with grass padding was less bulky for paddling than fur mittens. According to Curtis (1930, p.11), mittens of dehaired sealskin that reached barely to the wrist were also worn by men in the spring.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{subsistence}} {{activity for}} the Yup'ik is fishing, though hunting supplements {{the food supply}} and provides skins for clothing. The Yup'ik fur and skin clothing, like other Eskimo groups, is {{a key factor in}} ensuring their survival in the northernmost reaches of the globe. The raw materials of traditional Yup'ik clothing are skin (hide) and fur (pelt), intestine (gut), sinew, and grass. The raw material resources are sea and land mammals, birds, fish and plants. Traditionally, skins of birds, fish, and marine and land animals were used to make clothing. Hunting clothes were designed to be insulated and waterproof. <b>Fish</b> <b>skin</b> and marine mammal intestines were used for waterproof shells and boots. Grass was used to make insulating socks, and as a waterproof thread. Wastefulness being disrespectful, Yup'ik elders made use of every last scrap from hunts and harvests: seal guts became warm, waterproof, and breathable parkas; the skins of fish were fashioned into waterproof mittens, while their heads and entrails were stored in naturally refrigerated pits as insurance against future famine. Dried grasses became anything from insulating socks to bedding to sled rope, or even goggles to protect against snow blindness.|$|E

50|$|Another {{example is}} fish leather made from <b>fish</b> <b>skins</b> {{that are a}} {{by-product}} of the food industry. Fish leather tanning is less harmful on the environment due to no hair-removal being required, leading to less solid waste and organic pollutants in the wastewater from the process. Also, no poisonous, explosive hydrogen sulfide gas is released in the process.|$|R
25|$|People wore {{waterproof}} salmon-skin mittens to {{keep their}} hands dry while kayaking, driving a dog sled, or working with fish nets. Woven seashore grass liners went inside for warmth. To prepare the <b>fish</b> <b>skins,</b> they were first soaked in urine, scraped clean, and then hung outside to freeze-dry in cold weather. The last step was to scrape off the scales.|$|R

2500|$|Due to {{the heavily}} scaled {{skin of the}} Longnose gar, some of the {{mechanical}} properties differ from [...] model of describing how eel skin adds movement. The scale row resists longitudinal forces, which unlike eel skin, makes the skin stiffer in the longitudinal direction, providing myomeres with leverage and anchorage for pulling tendons. At low curvatures, {{it appears that the}} dermis is slack on both the concave and convex sides of the body. When the dermis is placed in tension, and resistance to bending is developed, which is referred to as flexural stiffness of the <b>fish</b> <b>skin.</b> The flexural stiffness {{is a result of the}} two dimensional stiffness of fish with heavily scaled skin, such as the longnose gar. This mechanical property of <b>fish</b> <b>skin</b> is important to the way a fish swims, because this mechanical property passively stiffens the body, which would otherwise would have been done muscularly. The flexural stiffness of <b>fish</b> <b>skin</b> act in a manner similar to the mechanism by which eel skin acts as an external tendon, however in the case of <b>fish</b> <b>skin,</b> the flexural stiffness acts as a mechanism to decelerate body movement rather than to generate a propulsive force.|$|E

50|$|Central to Hadzi-Vasileva's {{practice}} {{is a response}} to the particularities of place: its history, locale, environment and/or communities. She often uses materials that already have an existing link or history to the specific environment, which often results in new and unusual methods of working. Past works have included the use of organic materials, foodstuffs (butter, <b>fish</b> <b>skins,</b> chicken skins, internal animal organs, rice, and watercress) and precious metals (gold, silver, copper).|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to apply the natural dyes for non conventional leather with mordant environmental friendly. This research used lizard skins, cobra <b>skins</b> and kakap <b>fish</b> <b>skins</b> from dried preservation; woods extract of secang, tegeran, nangka, mahoni and tinggi; chrome and syntan as tanning agent; alum as mordant and material additives for tanning. The methods of this research were preparation of solution extract, tanning and testing. The principles of dyeing with the natural dyes used natural dyes withoud mixed dyestuffs and mordant environtment friendly. The research {{results showed that the}} natural dyes from secang woods, tegeran woods, nangka woods, mahoni woods and tingi bark were acid dyes with pH of 4 ‚Äì 5 and they could be applied on lizard skins, cobra <b>skins</b> and kakap <b>fish</b> <b>skins.</b> The natural dyes from mahoni woods had superior acid resistance (sulphate acid, formic acid and acetate acid), the value was 4 / 5 (grey scale) and also they had the dry and wet rub fastness which were better than those of natural dyes from secang, tegeran, nangka, and tinggi...|$|R

Nunivaarmiut men wore parkas made of silver salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) skin, while those of women were made of salmon trout (charr) (Salvelinus malma) skin and often had a white fox ruff on the hood. The Nunivaarmiut Cup'ig did not prepare their own fish skins for parkas, but bought them, already prepared, from Yup'ik people on the Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers. These imported skins had been stretched, smoke-dried, and scaled.|$|E
2500|$|Gefilte fish (from German gef√ºllte [...] "stuffed" [...] fish) was {{traditionally}} made by skinning {{the fish}} steaks, usually German carp, de-boning the flesh, mincing it and mixing with finely chopped browned onions (3:1), eggs, salt, pepper, and vegetable oil.

25|$|Like all fish, {{goldfish}} do {{not like}} to be petted. In fact, touching a goldfish can endanger its health, because it can cause the protective slime coat to be damaged or removed, exposing the <b>fish‚Äôs</b> <b>skin</b> to infection from bacteria or water-born parasites. However, goldfish respond to people by surfacing at feeding time, and can be trained or acclimated to taking pellets or flakes from human fingers.
