5|$|Alan Brooke, {{commander}} of the British II Corps sought to put the matter of cooperation right with King Leopold. The King discussed the matter with Brooke, who felt a compromise could be reached. Van Overstraeten, the King's military aide, stepped <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that the 10th Belgian Infantry Division could not be moved. Instead, the British should move further south and remain completely clear of Brussels. Brooke told the King that the 10th Belgian Division was {{on the wrong side}} of the Gamelin line and was exposed. Leopold deferred to his advisor and chief of staff. Brooke found Overstaeten to be ignorant of the situation and the dispositions of the BEF. Given that the left flank of the BEF rested on its Belgian ally, the British were now unsure about Belgian military capabilities.|$|E
500|$|According to author Bruce Spizer, the line-up for {{the basic}} track, before overdubs, was Lennon (vocals, {{acoustic}} guitar), Harrison (electric guitar), Preston (organ), Voormann (bass) and White (drums). Lennon later recalled of the recording: [...] "Phil (Spector) came <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'How do you want it?' And I said, '1950s' and he said 'Right' and BOOM! ... he played it back and there it was." [...] The song uses a similar amount of echo to 1950s Sun Records recordings.|$|E

Callie starts a new relationship with Penny Blake and leaves to go to New York {{with her in the}} twelfth-season finale. Shonda Rhimes spoke on Ramirez's abrupt departure, saying, [...] "This one was different because it wasn’t a big planned thing. I had a different plan going and when Sara came <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> ‘I really need to take this break,’ I was lucky that we’d shot {{the end of the season}} with her going to New York.” ...|$|E

500|$|The {{most famous}} {{incident}} in the hearings was an exchange between McCarthy and the army's chief legal representative, Joseph Nye Welch. On June 9, the 30th day of the hearings, Welch challenged Roy Cohn to provide U.S. Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. with McCarthy's list of 130 Communists or subversives in defense plants [...] "before the sun goes down". McCarthy stepped <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that if Welch was so concerned about persons aiding the Communist Party, he should check on {{a man in his}} Boston law office named Fred Fisher, who had once belonged to the National Lawyers Guild, a progressive lawyers association.|$|E
500|$|Initially unenthusiastic {{about his}} task of {{realising}} Alan Fennell's script, director David Elliott developed his inspiration {{after seeing the}} 1965 spy thriller film The Ipcress File, starring Michael Caine. He remembers that the film [...] "used all the old-fashioned shotslooking through a lampshade, etc. On Monday morning, Paddy [...] came <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I saw a film this weekend,' and I said, 'So did I.' 'Was it The Ipcress File?' 'Yep. Right, that's what I want to do.'" [...] In homage to The Ipcress File, Elliott decided to incorporate [...] "quirky visuals" [...] into his direction of the Thunderbirds episode.|$|E
500|$|Betts {{became the}} group's de facto leader during the {{recording}} process. [...] "It's not like Dickey came <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I'm taking over. I'm the boss. Do this and that.' It wasn't overt; {{it was still}} supposedly a democracy but Dickey started doing {{more and more of}} the songwriting," [...] said road manager Willie Perkins. The band first recorded [...] "Wasted Words" [...] and [...] "Ramblin' Man," [...] the latter showcasing a more country-infused sound. The entire group were initially reluctant to record [...] "Ramblin' Man" [...] — [...] "We knew it was a good song but it didn't sound like us," [...] said drummer Butch Trucks — but the band gradually headed in a more country direction, as that was Betts' background. Betts was very serious about his songwriting, sitting down each afternoon to write.|$|E

500|$|Al Kooper {{recalled}} {{that both the}} album title, Blonde on Blonde, and song titles arrived during the mixing sessions. [...] "When they were mixing it, we were sitting around and Bob Johnston came <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'What {{do you want to}} call this?' And [...] just like said them out one at a time... Free association and silliness, I'm sure, played a big role." [...] Another Dylan chronicler, Oliver Trager, notes that besides spelling out the initials of Dylan's first name, the album title is also a riff on Brecht on Brecht, a stage production based on works by German playwright Bertolt Brecht that had influenced his early songwriting. Dylan himself has said of the title: [...] "Well, I don't even recall exactly how it came up, but I know it was all in good faith... I don't know who thought of that. I certainly didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|From the start, Wilson {{envisioned a}} theremin for the track. AllMusic {{reviewer}} John Bush pointed out: [...] "Radio listeners could easily {{pick up the}} link between the title and the obviously electronic riffs sounding in the background of the chorus, but Wilson's use of the theremin added another delicious parallel—between the single's theme and its use of an instrument the player never even touched." [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] does not technically feature a theremin, but rather an Electro-Theremin, which is physically controlled by a knob {{on the side of the}} instrument. It was dubbed a [...] "theremin" [...] simply for convenience. At that time, theremins were most often associated with the 1945 Alfred Hitchcock film Spellbound, but its most common presence was in the theme music for the television sitcom My Favorite Martian, which ran from 1963 to 1966. Britz speculates: [...] "He just walked <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I have this new sound for you.' I think he must have heard the sound somewhere and loved it, and built a song around it." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{unanimously}} {{decided to}} carry on and arranged auditions for new bassists, with a renewed fervor and determination. Several bassists auditioned, but the band picked Lamar Williams, {{an old friend of}} drummer Jai Johanny Johanson's from Gulfport, Mississippi, two years removed from an Army stint in Vietnam. Chuck Leavell was asked to play piano for Allman’s solo album, Laid Back (1973), and gradually found himself contributing to the Allman Brothers as well. Dickey Betts became the group's de facto leader during the recording process. [...] "It's not like Dickey came <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I'm taking over. I'm the boss. Do this and that.' It wasn't overt; it was still supposedly a democracy, but Dickey started doing {{more and more of the}} songwriting," [...] said road manager Willie Perkins. Brothers and Sisters was an enormous success, peaking at number one, resulting in the band becoming [...] "the most popular band in the country." [...] "Ramblin' Man", Betts' country-infused number, received interest from radio stations immediately, and it rose to number two on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E

500|$|Less than 2 {{months after}} the shoot of the video, the American cable {{television}} network MTV put [...] "Hungry Like the Wolf" [...] into heavy rotation, playing it four times a day. The exposure eventually helped propel the single into the top 5 of the Billboard Hot 100, and the Rio album into the top 10 of the albums chart. Les Garland, senior {{executive vice president of}} MTV, said: [...] "I remember our director of talent and artist relations came running <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'You have got to see this video that’s come in.' Duran Duran were getting zero radio airplay at the time, and MTV wanted to try to break new music. 'Hungry Like the Wolf' was the greatest video I'd ever seen." [...] MTV named [...] "Hungry Like the Wolf" [...] the 15th most-played video of the network, and was 11th on the century-end MTV [...] "100 Greatest Videos Ever Made". [...] "Hungry Like the Wolf" [...] won the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video at the 26th Grammy Awards in February 1984, making it the first video to ever win that award. In 2001, VH1 rated it 31st on the [...] "VH1: 100 Greatest Videos".|$|E
500|$|Beastie Boys {{were signed}} as the opening act for the tour. Adam [...] "MCA" [...] Yauch {{of the group}} recollected: [...] "One day, Russell Simmons, co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, came <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Hey guess what—Madonna's manager called. Do {{you guys want to}} go on tour with her?" [...] DeMann had asked for another group called The Fat Boys, but Simmons did not manage them and lied, saying [...] "Oh, the Fat Boys have another gig that week. What about Run–D.M.C.?" [...] But they were too {{expensive}} according to DeMann, and hence ultimately Beastie Boys were chosen. Adam [...] "Ad-Rock" [...] Horovitz from the band commented: [...] "It's not like any of us knew Madonna that much, but we all used to hang out at Dancetaria [...] so we knew about each other. I don't know why she {{thought it would be a}} good idea , though. It was a terrible idea. But it was great for her in a way because we were so awful that by the time she came onstage, the audience had to be happy." [...] The circular stage for the tour, consisted of three ramps around the perimeter, which were connected with each other. A long line of stairs descended to the main stage from the central ramp; it was flanked by the band. About 30 feet above the stage, the speakers were suspended from a circular beam. Four giant screens lined the outer perimeter of the stage, on three sides.|$|E
2500|$|Charlotte Gainsbourg as [...] "She": French actress Eva Green was {{initially}} approached {{for the female}} lead. According to Trier, Green was positive about appearing in the film, but her agents refused to allow her. The unsuccessful casting attempt took two months of the pre-production process. Eventually Gainsbourg turned up, and by Trier's words she was very eager to get cast: [...] "Charlotte came <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I'm dying to get the part no matter what.' So I {{think it was a}} decision she made very early and she stuck to it. We had no problems whatsoever." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, by August the BBC {{had decided}} to {{terminate}} the group due to perceived unpopularity and being [...] "... {{out of step with}} viewers". Their final appearance was in October 1976 (by this time Trace and Gillespie had already left, reducing Ruby Flipper to five members), with the senior management insisting on a replacement all-female grouping. Flick Colby recalled of this time [...] "Bill Cotton called me <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> the British public didn’t want to see black men dancing with white women...I argued, but he told me to form another all-girl group or I was out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dupré began singing professionally when Jerry Cooper, a {{musician}} {{she was living}} with, heard her singing the Aretha Franklin version of the song [...] "Respect" [...] in the shower. [...] "She had this huge voice for such a little girl," [...] Cooper told MTV, [...] "and so I just kind of went <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Hey, come upstairs when you're done with this, and let's work on some songs.'" [...] According to Dupré, she then toured and recorded with Cooper's band, networking {{with people in the}} music industry. In 2005, she formed a company named Pasche New York, an entertainment business intended to promote her music career.|$|E
2500|$|Producer Ken Nelson took a {{hands-off}} {{approach to}} producing Haggard. In the episode of American Masters dedicated to him, Haggard remembers: [...] "The producer I had at that time, Ken Nelson, was {{an exception to}} the rule. He called me 'Mr. Haggard' and I was a little twenty-four, twenty-five year old punk from Oildale... He gave me complete responsibility. I think if he'd jumped <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Oh, you can't do that,' it would've destroyed me." [...] In the documentary series Lost Highway, Nelson recalls, [...] "When I first started recording Merle, I became so enamored with his singing that I would forget what else was going on, and I suddenly realized, 'Wait a minute, there's musicians here you've got to worry about!' But his songs—he was a great writer." ...|$|E

He has elaborated that [...] "I will always be a Catholic. But I want my church to join the human race and finally walk away from this antisexual theology." [...] In the 1980s, Donahue was the first national television program to reveal widespread child molestation by Catholic priests, something for which he was widely criticized. In 2002 he told Oprah Winfrey, [...] "I once did a priest pedophilia show on St. Patrick's Day, and a priest called <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'How am I supposed to work on a playground with children?' When I was a kid, we used to have a sin called 'giving scandal' which meant criticizing the church. And that's exactly how we got where we are now." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Lucas was filming in London, where {{additional}} casting took place, Baker, {{performing a}} musical comedy act with his acting partner Jack Purvis, {{learned that the}} film crew {{was looking for a}} small person to fit inside a robot suit and maneuver it; Baker, who was [...] tall, was cast immediately after meeting George Lucas. He said, [...] "He saw me come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> 'He'll do' because I was the smallest guy they'd seen up until then." [...] He initially turned down the role three times, hesitant to appear in a film where his face would not be shown and hoping to continue the success of his comedy act, which had recently started to be televised. R2-D2's recognizable beeps and squeaks were made by sound designer Ben Burtt and Lucas imitating [...] "baby noises", recording these voices as they were heard on an intercom, and creating the final mix using a synthesizer.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1984, Double Trouble began {{recording}} {{their second}} studio album, Couldn't Stand the Weather, at the Power Station, with John Hammond as executive producer and engineer Richard Mullen. Layton later recalled working with Hammond: [...] "He {{was kind of}} like a nice hand on your shoulder, as opposed to someone that jumped <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Let's redo this, let's do that more.' He didn't get involved in that way at all. He was a feedback person." [...] As the sessions began, Vaughan's cover of Bob Geddins' [...] "Tin Pan Alley" [...] was recorded while audio levels were being checked. Layton remembers the performance: [...] "...we did probably the quietest version we ever did up 'til that point. We ended it and [...] said, 'That's the best that song will ever sound,' and we went, 'We haven't even got sounds, have we?' He goes, 'That doesn't matter. That's the best you'll ever do that song.' We tried it again five, six, seven times—I can't even remember. But it never quite sounded like it did that first time." ...|$|E
