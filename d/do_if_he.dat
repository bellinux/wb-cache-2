She is later shown in a secret base donning a helmet that is a combination of Cyclops and Magneto's in preparation for her next move, as she is now wanted and on the run from both the Inhumans and X-Men for her actions since Cyclops' death.|$|E
25|$|Haig {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the War Cabinet (7 January). He claimed to have recommended that the British should keep the initiative and draw in German reserves (to prevent a German attack on the French) by renewing the offensive around Ypres, and that this proposal did not meet with political approval. In fact the logistical infrastructure was not available for a breakout from the Ypres salient, and {{there is no mention of}} his suggestion in the official minutes. The minutes do agree with Haig's account that he warned only of limited German offensives. After the meeting Robertson, who had also been present and who had been concerned that Haig had not got his point across, insisted that Haig submit a paper warning of the danger of a major German offensive. Over lunch (9 January) at 10 Downing Street with Lord Derby (Secretary of State for War) and Lloyd George (Derby bet a skeptical Lloyd George 100 cigars to 100 cigarettes that the war would be over by the following year), Haig predicted that the war would end within a year because of the “internal state of Germany” (a broadly accurate prediction). Charteris’ final intelligence report had deduced that Germany was bringing 32 divisions, ten per month, from the moribund Eastern Front, so the most likely time for a German Offensive was in late March (again, a correct prediction). Bonar Law (Chancellor of the Exchequer and Conservative Leader) asked Haig what he would <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were a German general: Haig replied that any German attempt to “break through” would be a “gambler’s throw” as Germany had only a million men as reserves and the balance of manpower would shift in favour of the Allies in August (i.e. when more US troops had arrived - in fact this would happen a month or two earlier as US deployment was speeded up after the German Spring Offensives) and that if he were a German general he would launch only limited offensives, although he did warn that the German generals might try to keep the civilians out of power by launching an attack to knock out France. Haig again left the politicians with the impression that he thought the Germans would launch small attacks on the scale of Cambrai.|$|E

[...] Despite this answer and his socialist views in general, his responses to the board's cross-examination satisfied them that he was not a communist, and they awarded him the scholarship.|$|E

500|$|He {{began the}} 1981 season with five {{consecutive}} 100-yard games, including a 253-yard effort. [...] Woolfolk's best {{game as a}} Wolverine was the October 10, 1981 contest against Michigan State. The Wolverines beat the Spartans, 38-20, and Woolfolk rushed for 253 yards in 39 carries. After the game, Coach Bo Schembechler said: [...] "I wondered what a kid like that would <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> ran {{as much as the}} guy on the West Coast (Marcus Allen). I didn't plan on this, but he proved he can do it. Butch is going to be our all-time leading ground gainer. There isn't any way they're going to stop him now. And so be it." [...] His 1981 rushing performance against the Spartans still stands as the fifth best single-game performance by a Wolverine running back.|$|E
500|$|Kosygin {{was sent}} by Stalin to each home to put their houses into [...] "proper order". Assignments such as these made Kosygin unpopular with certain members of the Soviet leadership. Kosygin told his {{son-in-law}} Mikhail Gvishiani, an NKVD officer, of the accusations leveled against his co-worker Nikolai Voznesensky, then Chairman of the State Planning Committee and a First Deputy Premier, because of his possession of firearms. Gvishiani and Kosygin threw all their weapons into a lake and searched both their houses for any listening devices. They found one at Kosygin's house, but {{it might have been}} installed to spy on Marshal Georgy Zhukov, who had lived there before him. According to his memoirs, Kosygin never left his home without reminding his wife what to <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did not return from work. After living two years in constant fear, the family reached the conclusion that Stalin would not harm them.|$|E
500|$|However, because Joshua did not {{actually}} die, the Game was nullified and Neku is forced {{to play the game}} a third time. His entry fee this time is all of the other players, meaning Neku cannot form any pacts and stands no chance against the Noise. However, Beat immediately defects from the Reapers and rejoins Neku. Neku and Beat find that the Reapers and the entire population of Shibuya are wearing special red pins that cause them to think the same harmonious thoughts. Without any missions to complete, the two venture to the fabled [...] "Shibuya River", which Joshua was looking for during the second week. At the river, they find , the Game's Conductor.

500|$|During the Third Reich, Adolf Hitler {{hindered}} Richard Kuhn, Adolf Butenandt, and Gerhard Domagk from accepting their prizes. All of {{them were}} awarded their diplomas and gold medals after World War II. In 1958, Boris Pasternak declined his prize for literature due to fear of what the Soviet Union government might <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> travelled to Stockholm to accept his prize. In return, the Swedish Academy refused his refusal, saying [...] "this refusal, of course, in no way alters {{the validity of the}} award." [...] The Academy announced with regret that the presentation of the Literature Prize could not take place that year, holding it until 1989 when Pasternak's son accepted the prize on his behalf. Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, but her children accepted the prize because she had been placed under house arrest in Burma; Suu Kyi delivered her speech two decades later, in 2012. Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 while {{he and his wife were}} under house arrest in China as political prisoners, and he was unable to accept the prize in his lifetime.|$|E
500|$|In special {{elections}} in June, pro-Union candidates captured 9 of 10 seats in Kentucky's House delegation. Returning to the Senate {{for a special}} session in July, Breckinridge {{was regarded as a}} traitor by most of his fellow legislators because of his Confederate sympathies. He condemned as unconstitutional Lincoln's enlistment and arming of men for a war Congress had not officially declared, his expending funds for the war that had not been allocated by Congress, and his suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. He was the only senator to vote against a resolution authorizing Lincoln to use [...] "the entire resources of the government" [...] for the war. Asked what he would <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were president, he replied, [...] "I would prefer to see these States all reunited upon true constitutional principles to any other object that could be offered me in life... But I infinitely prefer to see a peaceful separation of these States than to see endless, aimless, devastating war, {{at the end of which}} I see the grave of public liberty and of personal freedom." [...] On August 1, he declared that, if Kentucky sided with the federal government against the Confederacy, [...] "she will be represented by some other man on the floor of this Senate." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{vote was}} largely {{seen as a}} {{referendum}} on Truman, whose approval rating had sunk to 32 percent over the president's controversial handling of a wave of post-war labor strikes, including a United Auto Workers strike against Ford and General Motors in 1945, a United Mine Workers strike starting in April 1946, and a national railroad worker strike that began in May. Further, the back-and-forth over whether to end unpopular wartime price controls to handle shortages, particularly in meat and other foodstuffs.

The following week, he won the PGA Championship at Valhalla for his fourth major, one shot ahead of runner-up Phil Mickelson.
