5|$|Johnson and Larry Bird {{were first}} linked as rivals after Johnson's Michigan State squad {{defeated}} Bird's Indiana State {{team in the}} 1979 NCAA finals. The rivalry continued in the NBA, and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in {{three out of four}} NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987. Johnson asserted that for him, the 82-game regular season was composed of 80 normal games, and two Lakers–Celtics games. Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson's daily box score was the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> checked in the morning.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> {{had to do}} was {{determine}} the characteristics of the aircraft that would be used. There were only two Allied aircraft large enough: the British Avro Lancaster and the US Boeing B-29 Superfortress. The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) wanted to use the B-29 if at all possible, even though it required substantial modification. Ramsey supervised the test drop program, which began at Dahlgren, Virginia, in August 1943, before moving to Muroc Dry Lake, California, in March 1944. Mock ups of Thin Man and Fat Man bombs were dropped and tracked by an SCR-584 ground based radar set of the kind that Ramsey had helped develop at the Radiation laboratory. Numerous problems were discovered with the bombs and the aircraft modifications, and corrected.|$|E
5|$|Haynes {{returned}} to Assam in June 1943, to organize for Bissell the Assam-American Air Base Command (AAABC) which he led as a mixed force composed primarily of Tenth Air Force units with {{some elements of}} the Fourteenth Air Force. Haynes was tasked with coordinating area defense and offensive destruction of the enemy, {{the emphasis on the}} former. For the first two months, Haynes was given fewer officers and men than he deemed necessary, and the AAABC made little headway in its mission. In mid-August, large-scale re-organization of Allied forces in Asia resulted in the AAABC being renamed the , and placed under George E. Stratemeyer. Haynes led the group until September 1943, when he {{returned to}} the U.S. after 18 months in Asia. Before he left, he told American reporters that his forces had helped deny the port of Rangoon to the enemy, and helped soften Burma for invasion. He stated that the highlight of his time in Asia was the air raid against Hong Kong. After his upcoming air crossing of the Atlantic, his eighth such, Haynes said that the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> intended to do was look up his 14-year-old son in high school and his wife who was working in the drafting department at Sperry in Garden City, New York.|$|E
50|$|In 1846 Henry Clement was {{appointed}} as the railway's Resident Engineer {{and one of}} the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> did was to have a locomotive works built there. In 1857 the first locomotive was built at the works, 'Venus' a small 2-4-0 passenger loco.|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} Greek {{thought about}} poetry considered the theogonies {{to be the}} prototypical poetic genre—the prototypical mythos—and imputed almost magical powers to it. Orpheus, the archetypal poet, also was the archetypal singer of theogonies, which he uses to calm seas and storms in Apollonius' Argonautica, and to move the stony hearts of the underworld gods in his descent to Hades. When Hermes invents the lyre in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> does is sing about {{the birth of the}} gods. Hesiod's Theogony is not only the fullest surviving account of the gods, but also the fullest surviving account of the archaic poet's function, with its long preliminary invocation to the Muses. Theogony also was the subject of many lost poems, including those attributed to Orpheus, Musaeus, Epimenides, Abaris, and other legendary seers, which were used in private ritual purifications and mystery-rites. There are indications that Plato was familiar with some version of the Orphic theogony. A silence would have been expected about religious rites and beliefs, however, and that nature of the culture would not have been reported by members of the society while the beliefs were held. After they ceased to become religious beliefs, few would have known the rites and rituals. Allusions often existed, however, to aspects that were quite public.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Moreira married Vicenta, his {{troubles}} began. The Deputy Mayor of the area, known as Don Francisco, had also {{fallen in love}} with La Vicenta, so as a form of vengeance he began charging Moreira fines for everything he could think of, real or imaginary. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> did was charge Moreira 500 pesos for having his wedding celebration without proper authorization.|$|E
25|$|J. R. R. Tolkien {{constructed}} many Elvish languages. These {{were the}} languages spoken by the tribes of his Elves. Tolkien was a philologist by profession, and {{spent much time}} on his constructed languages. The Elvish languages were the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> imagined for his secondary world. Tolkien said that his stories grew out of his languages. Tolkien also created scripts for his Elvish languages, of which the best known are the Sarati, the Tengwar, and the Cirth.|$|E

60|$|The <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> noticed {{were the}} {{newspapers}} on the stands. April 5, 1961. He {{was not too}} far off. He looked around him. There was a filling station, a garage, some taverns, and a ten-cent store. Down the street was a grocery store and some public buildings.|$|R
5000|$|Herb Denenberg {{writing for}} the Philadelphia Bulletin said, [...] "The book covers {{a broad range of}} subjects, but one of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> takes up is the British {{national}} health insurance system and there’s good reason for that emphasis. He starts out by telling us he had so much envy for Americans".|$|R
25|$|His {{adoptive father}} was a {{hard-working}} coal miner, but the family still had trouble making ends meet. Gavin quit school after eighth grade and became a full-time clerk at a shoe store for $12.50 a week. His next stint was as a manager for Jewel Oil Company. A combination of restlessness and limited future opportunities in his hometown caused Gavin {{to run away from}} home. In March 1924, on his 17th birthday, he took the night train to New York. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> did upon arriving was to send a telegram to his parents saying everything was all right to prevent them from reporting him missing to the police. After that, he started looking for a job.|$|E
25|$|In 1875, he {{was named}} Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford and in 1876 assumed the new Chair of Chinese Language and Literature at Oxford, where he {{attracted}} few students to his lectures but worked hard for some 20 years in his study at 3 Keble Terrace, on his translations of the Chinese classics. According to an anonymous contemporary obituary in the Pall Mall Gazette, Legge was in his study every morning at three o'clock, winter and summer, having retired to bed at ten. When he {{got up in the}} morning the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> did was to make himself a cup of tea over a spirit-lamp. Then he worked away at his translations while all the household slept.|$|E
25|$|Accounts differ as to {{the next}} {{sequence}} of events. After the collision, Lifsh said that the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> did {{was to try to}} lift the car in order to free the two children beneath it. The EMS unit that arrived on the scene about three minutes after the accident said that Lifsh was being beaten and pulled out of the station wagon by three or four men. A volunteer ambulance from the Hatzolah ambulance corps arrived on the scene at about 8:23pm, followed by police and a City ambulance, which took Gavin Cato to Kings County Hospital, arriving at 8:32pm; Cato was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. Volunteers from a second Hatzolah ambulance helped Angela Cato, until a second City ambulance arrived and took her to the same hospital.|$|E
50|$|Iftikhar Qaisar imagines, {{that during}} his {{childhood}} his mother’s stories about English culture may have touched and inspired {{him with a}} curiosity to western culture.

50|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} {{he was invited}} to join the Institute on Religion and Public Life by its founder, Richard John Neuhaus, and {{became a member of the}} {{editorial}} board of the institute's journal, <b>First</b> <b>Things.</b> <b>He</b> is also a member of the advisory board of The G.K.

60|$|He took up jewellery, read Benvenuto Cellini, {{pored over}} reproductions of ornament, {{and began to}} make {{pendants}} in silver and pearl and matrix. The <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> did, in his start of discovery, were really beautiful. Those later were more imitative. But, starting with his wife, he made a pendant each for all his womenfolk. Then he made rings and bracelets.|$|R

[...] The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> did was join the Territorial Army for six months. Although he enjoyed {{his time in the}} TA, Dickinson {{realised}} {{that it was not a}} career choice, and so he applied for a place to read history at Queen Mary College, London. His parents wanted him in the army, but he told them that he wanted to get a degree first, which acted as his [...] "cover story", and immediately began playing in bands.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, he {{was opposed}} by Republican Ronald A. Crews, an evangelical pastor, former Georgia state legislator, and {{president}} of the Massachusetts Family Institute. Crews, a national conservative activist, challenged McGovern's positions on same-sex marriage and abortion. McGovern derided his opponent's focus on social issues, saying, [...] "When Ron Crews gets up in the morning, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> thinks about is gay marriage. I don't think that is the most important issue for most families. Jobs, health care, education, how {{to make the world a}} more peaceful place, those are the issues people care about." [...] McGovern defeated Crews with 71 percent of the vote, and ran unopposed in 2006 and 2008.|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy {{was recorded in}} Oahu, Hawaii, a trait that [...] "So Appalled" [...] shares. Following several media controversies, West decided to record his next album in a reclusive manner only working with artists he considered himself familiar with. [...] Amongst the various artists invited down to Hawaii to record songs for the album was Pusha T, a rapper known for the hip-hop duo Clipse. While in Hawaii, Pusha-T commented that the very <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> recorded was his verse for [...] "So Appalled". He favorably compared recording with West with another producer {{he was used to}} working with, Pharrell Williams, commenting that he enjoyed how the process was more of a canvas.|$|E
500|$|... "Radio Bart" [...] {{was written}} by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza, though series creator Matt Groening {{came up with the}} idea for it. The episode was based on the 1951 film Ace in the Hole, which sees the story of a down-and-out journalist exploiting a story about a man trapped in a cave to re-jump start his career. Vitti did not watch the film until after the episode had been written; [...] " [...] came in out of nowhere and just gave me, start to finish, the whole story." [...] Vitti said renting the film was the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> did after finishing the script. He remarked, [...] "It's surprisingly hard to rent. It's really dark and funny and it's by Billy Wilder, so you think it would be in stores, but it's not. It was hard to find." ...|$|E
500|$|As Edgeworth {{had been}} a popular {{character}} ever since start of the series, Takumi {{found it difficult to}} come up with a way to bring him back without having him, a supposedly great prosecutor, always lose to Phoenix. While he was writing the story for the game's final case, he thought of the idea to have Edgeworth become a player character; he liked this idea so much that he immediately started to rewrite the case. In order to allow Edgeworth to be the player character, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> did was to [...] "get rid of" [...] Phoenix by having him fall from a bridge into an icy river. He enjoyed writing from another character's perspective, who thought differently from Phoenix; he also used the case to explore the relationship between Edgeworth and Gumshoe. One of the game's episodes had originally been written for Justice for All: it had been intended as the fourth episode of Justice for All, but was cut due to memory limiations, and ended up being reused as the third episode of Trials and Tribulations.|$|E

60|$|George Littlemore {{arrived in}} London on the twentieth of May, {{and one of}} the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> did was to go and see Waterville at the Legation, where he {{mentioned}} that he had taken {{for the rest of the}} season a house at Queen Anne’s Gate, so that his sister and her husband, who, under the pressure of diminished rents, had let their own town residence, might come up and spend a couple of months with him.|$|R
500|$|In October 2012, Brian Tyler {{signed on}} to score the film. According to Tyler, he was {{approached}} more for his [...] "thematic" [...] scores such as The Greatest Game Ever Played, Annapolis and Partition rather than his [...] "modern" [...] action scores such as The Fast and Furious films, with Kevin Feige asking a theme that was recognizable and featured those dramatic tones. To employ the [...] "deeply thematic component with a strong melody," [...] the score employs mostly orchestra sounds. The main theme for Iron Man focuses on horns and trumpets, to be [...] "both a march and anthem." [...] Tyler mentioned that John Williams' work in Raiders of the Lost Ark was the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> thought as an influence, and the cue for the Well of Souls in Raiders influenced the Extremis motif, as Tyler felt it should enhance an spiritual side for having a [...] "technology so advanced that nears magic." [...] Echoing the Mandarin's amalgamated personality, his theme was religious music [...] "that borrows from many cultures," [...] from [...] "Monastic, Gothic, and Christian chants to music from the Middle-East." [...] The score was recorded with the London Philharmonic Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios. Tyler is the third primary composer to score an Iron Man film, following Ramin Djawadi of Iron Man and John Debney of Iron Man 2.|$|E

[...] Hector tried {{to earn a living}} as a painter, messenger, porter and concierge.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Glenn Chugg {{was born}} on 15 June 1947 in Launceston to Victor Chugg and Lorna (née Hancock). Chugg was the eldest of four children, while his grandmother, Ella Chugg, was his [...] "best friend". He credits his {{great-grandfather}} with his idiosyncratic use of profanity [...] "the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> did was taught me to swear. And it's always been {{a major part of}} my delivery of things. There might have been one or two instance over the 40 years where I was probably out of order but in the main it's usually been because it needed to be done".

50|$|Because of the Russian {{persecution}} of Jews however, Hubert {{at the age}} of 35 decided to move to the United States in 1890.

He arrived at Ellis Island in 1891 and, like many other immigrants, without knowing anybody. One of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> did then was change his birth name from Akiba Horowitz to Conrad Hubert.|$|R
