Prolonged storage of purified hepatitis B core <b>antigen</b> <b>particles</b> or incubation with human immunoglobulin G preparations containing antibody to the hepatitis B core antigen with or without antibody to the hepatitis B e antigen resulted in the conversion of the polypeptide with an apparent size of 20, 600 daltons to ones with apparent sizes of 14, 700 and approximately 6, 000 daltons, suggesting proteolytic cleavage of the 20, 600 -dalton polypeptide under these conditions...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the diagnostic value {{and the relationship}} with clinicopathological features of total and <b>free</b> prostate-specific <b>antigen</b> by measuring the concentrations of these markers in the sera of 75 women with colorectal carcinoma and in 30 healthy women. Measurements were performed by immunoradiometric assay which utilizes monoclonal and polyclonal anti-prostate-specific antigen antibodies; the lowest detection level for both markers was 0. 01 [*]ng[*]ml− 1. <b>Free</b> prostate-specific <b>antigen</b> levels were significantly higher in women with colorectal carcinoma than healthy women (P= 0. 006). The percentage of <b>free</b> prostate-specific <b>antigen</b> predominant (<b>free</b> prostate-specific antigen/total prostate-specific antigen > 50 %) subjects was 20 % in colorectal carcinoma patients and 3. 3 % in healthy women (P= 0. 035). Cut-off values were 0. 34 [*]ng[*]ml− 1 for total prostate-specific antigen and 0. 01 [*]ng[*]ml− 1 for <b>free</b> prostate-specific <b>antigen.</b> In women with colorectal carcinoma, total prostate-specific antigen positivity was 20 % and <b>free</b> prostate-specific <b>antigen</b> positivity was 34. 6 %. When compared to negatives, total prostate-specific antigen positive patients had a lower percentage of well-differentiated (P= 0. 056) and early stage (stages I and II) tumours (P= 0. 070). However, patients with predominant <b>free</b> prostate-specific <b>antigen,</b> had {{a higher percentage of}} well-differentiated (P= 0. 014) and early stage tumours (P= 0. 090) than patients with predominant bound prostate-specific antigen. In conclusion, although the sensitivity of <b>free</b> prostate-specific <b>antigen</b> predominancy is low (20 %), in distinguishing women with colorectal carcinoma than healthy women, its specificity is high (96. 7 %). <b>Free</b> prostate-specific <b>antigen</b> predominancy tends to be present in less aggressive tumours.

40|$|The {{compounds}} {{formed by}} tobacco mosaic virus and by human serum albumin with their antibodies were studied electrophoretically. Those {{formed by the}} virus at different antigen/antibody ratios in the reacting mixtures differed greatly in their electrophoretic mobility which ranged from the mobility of <b>free</b> <b>antigen</b> to the mobility approaching that of free antibody. The differences in the mobility probably resulted from corresponding differences in antigen/antibody ratios in the antigen-antibody compounds. By contrast, human serum albumin formed compounds of a constant, or nearly constant, mobility irrespective of antigen/antibody ratios in the reacting mixtures, and when the precipitate formed at equivalence was dissolved in a solution of antigen, the amount of <b>free</b> <b>antigen</b> separated from the compound by electrophoresis was apparently {{the same as that}} in which the precipitate was dissolved. This and other evidence suggests that the albumin combined with its antibody at a constant ratio to form a compound that was stable during electrophoresis. The ratio was that of equivalence.

The coexistence of phenotypic type I (reduction in total and <b>free</b> <b>antigen)</b> and type III (reduction in <b>free</b> <b>antigen</b> only) protein S deficiencies in 14 of 18 families was recently reported. We investigated {{the cause of this}} phenotypic variation in the largest of these families (122 family members, including 44 affected individuals) using both molecular genetic and phenotypic analysis. We have identified a sole causative mutation (Gly 295 Val) in three family members representative of the variable phenotype.

40|$|It has {{generally}} been observed that {{during the course of}} immunization the appearance of antibody in circulation follows the disappearance of antigen (1, 2). Appreciable amounts of <b>free</b> <b>antigen</b> and its homologous free antibody apparently do not coexist in a single system (3). Existence of complexes consisting of circulating bound antibody and antigen could depend upon several factors. The earliest antibody formed during immunization may conceivably combine with antigen present in circulation. Even if the aggregates formed fail to precipitate they may escape detection by the serologic methods thus far developed. Present immunologic methods adequately detect free antibody by reactions resulting from addition of <b>antigen,</b> and similarly, <b>free</b> <b>antigen</b> can be detected by addition of antibody.

Adding antibody to mixtures of <b>free</b> <b>antigen</b> and antigen excess complexes increased the Pl. A. titre greatly (≥ 64 -fold).

40|$|Background: Pregnancy is a {{physiological}} hypercoagulable state {{with an increased}} incidence of thromboembolic phenomena. There {{is an increase in}} the concentrations of most clotting factors, a decrease in concentration of some of the natural anticoagulants and reduced fibrinolytic activity. Changes in PS levels have also been reported. Aim: To establish referral range values of functional PS and <b>free</b> PS <b>antigen,</b> during the second (2 nd T) and third trimester (3 rd T) of normal gestation. Patients and methods: Forty one normal pregnant women were included in our study, 20 during the 2 nd T (22 - 24 weeks) and 21 during the 3 rd T (29 - 38 weeks). Functional PS was measured by a clot based test and <b>free</b> PS <b>antigen</b> by ELISA. Results: <b>Free</b> PS <b>Antigen</b> was 65. 8 ± 18. 3 % during the 2 nd T and 62. 3 ± 16. 5 % during the 3 rd T. The figures for normal controls were 106 ± 6. 5 %. Functional PS was 43. 8 ± 13. 3 and 25. 9 ± 14. 6 % during the 2 nd T and 3 rd T, respectively. The figures for normal controls were 97 ± 24 % (p < 0. 001 compared with pregnant women). <b>Free</b> PS <b>antigen</b> did not change from the 2 nd to the 3 rd T (p=NS), however functional PS fell significantly from the 2 nd to the 3 rd T (p < 0. 001) and was significantly lower than <b>free</b> PS <b>antigen</b> in both trimesters (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Pregnancy is associated to a decrease in PS. This abnormality is more pronounced for functional PS than <b>free</b> PS <b>antigen</b> and functional PS falls progressively during pregnancy.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focused on}} detecting waterborne pathogens in a microfluidic biosensing system which enables point-of-care, real-time monitoring. Within this framework, I have been addressing three objectives. The first {{objective was to}} enhance mixing of particles in a microfluidic device. To this end, SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) or Tween 80 (polyethylene sorbitol ester) {{was added to the}} antibody-conjugated polystyrene microparticle suspension. Both surfactants showed non-specific binding (with SDS) or very poor diffusion (with Tween 80). As an alternative approach, highly carboxylated polystyrene microparticles showed very low non-specific binding comparable to that with Tween 80 and good diffusional mixing equivalent to that with SDS. This work was published in Appendix A (© 2008 Elsevier). The second objective was to detect E. coli K- 12 using the microfluidic-based system with low detection limit in Appendix B (© 2008 Elsevier). This method was essentially one-step and requires no sample pre-treatment or cell culturing. Conventional immunoassay using polyclonal antibody detects not only viable cells, but also dead cell and <b>free</b> <b>antigens.</b> In order to reduce false positive signal originated from dead cells and <b>free</b> <b>antigens,</b> target solution was washed three times. The detection limit was as low as 40 cfu ml⁻¹ or 4 cfu per device (viable cells only), or < 10 cfu ml⁻¹ or < 1 cfu per device (including dead cells and <b>free</b> <b>antigens).</b> Our final objective was to develop real-time, high sensitive method for detecting waterborne pathogens in a water distribution system in Appendix C. Detection of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in a single straight pipe was demonstrated using a microfluidic system utilizing light scattering detection of latex immunoagglutination assay. Assay time is < 5 min per assay and detection limit is 10 cfu ml⁻¹. Optical signals are compared with viable E. coli counts (not real time) and salt tracer experiments.

To prepare an immunological probe for identification of cellular components interacting with the hepatitis B virus (HBV), polyclonal antisera against a panel of five HBV-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were produced in syngeneic BALB/c mice. MAbs to HBV used for immunization (Ab 1) recognized biologically important and potentially neutralizing epitopes, located in the pre-S 1, pre-S 2, or S region-encoded domains of HBV proteins. All the anti-Ids (Ab 2) were specific to idiotopes of the homologous Ab 1 and inhibited their interaction with the corresponding viral epitopes, suggesting that they recognized unique determinants on the paratope of each immunizing Ab 1. Therefore, all five generated polyclonal anti-Ids were of the Ab 2 beta type and could represent internal images of viral epitopes. Ab 2 raised against the pre-S 2 region-specific MAb F 124 bound to the extracellular matrix fibronectin of human liver sinusoids. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated the attachment of viral and recombinant (S, M) hepatitis B surface <b>antigen</b> <b>particles</b> with the pre-S 2 region-encoded epitopes to the fibronectin of human liver sinusoids.

We confirm here that particle uptake by MO permits exogenous ovaalbumin (OVA) {{to gain access to}} the endogenous class I processing pathway, an event that occurs rarely, if at all, in the absence of phagocytic stimuli.

A variety of unconjugated particles promoted presentation of simultaneously offered soluble OVA to Kb-restricted T cells by both MO and non-MO antigen-presenting cells (APC), provided the latter could phagocytose the particles.

The cytokines released from in vitro-stimulated spleens showed a strong gamma interferon response in all immunized groups. A significant reduction in CFU in liver and spleen was seen in the orally immunized groups compared to the nonimmunized group after oral challenge with serovar Enteritidis. Western blotting analysis with both sera and feces revealed that antibodies against three bands, 53, 56, and 60 kDa, dominated the oral groups, and an electrospray-mass spectroscopy analysis of these bands showed amino acid sequences coinciding with those of phase- 1 flagellin and hook-associated protein 2...|$|R
40|$|Macrophage uptake and {{presentation}} of thyroglobulin (TG) were investigated in rats with experimental autoimmune thyroiditis induced by immunization with TG and adjuvant. Peritoneal macrophages {{were shown to}} take up radiolabelled TG and this did {{not depend on the}} presence of thyroiditis in the animal or on the strain of rat used. Cell-associated antigen was largely unaffected by trypsin. Macrophages primed in vitro with TG produced a rise in the circulating TG autoantibody levels of convalescent animals when given intravenously (unlike <b>free</b> <b>antigen),</b> but did not induce disease in virgin animals. These findings show that macrophages can bind and present TG and suggest that this process may perpetuate otherwise transient autoimmune reactions...|$|R
