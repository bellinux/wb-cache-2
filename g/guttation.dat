40|$|In the {{understanding}} of colony loss phenomena, a worldwide crisis of honeybee colonies which has serious consequences for both apiculture and bee-pollinationdependent farm production, analytical chemistry {{can play an important}} role. For instance, rapid and accurate analytical procedures are currently required to better assess the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on honeybee health. Since their introduction in agriculture, neonicotinoid insecticides have been blamed for being highly toxic to honeybees, possibly at the nanogram per bee level or lower. As a consequence, most of the analytical methods recently optimized have focused on the analysis of ultratraces of neonicotinoids using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry techniques to study the effects of sublethal doses. However, recent evidences on two novel routes—seedling <b>guttations</b> and seed coating particulate, both associated with corn crops —that may expose honeybees to huge amounts of neonicotinoids in the field, with instantly lethal effects, suggest that selected procedures need optimizing. In the present work, a simplified ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–diode-array detection method for the determination of neonicotinoids in single bees has been optimized and validated. The method ensures good selectivity, good accuracy, and adequate detection limits, which make it suitable for the purpose, while maintaining its ability to evaluate exposure variability of individual bees. It has been successfully applied to the analysis of bees in free flight over an experimental sowing field, with the bees therefore being exposed to seed coating particulate released by the pneumatic drilling machine...|$|R

50|$|Girolami et al. (2005) {{found that}} <b>guttation</b> drops from corn plants germinated from neonicotinoid-coated seeds could contain amounts of {{insecticide}} consistently higher than 10 mg/l, {{and up to}} 200 mg/l for the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. Concentrations this high are near those of active ingredients applied in field sprays for pest control and sometimes even higher. It was found that when bees consume <b>guttation</b> drops collected from plants grown from neonicotinoid-coated seeds, they die within a few minutes. This phenomenon may {{be a factor in}} bee deaths and, consequently, colony collapse disorder (CCD).|$|E
5000|$|The {{hydathode}} structures discharge water—a phenomenon called <b>guttation</b> through {{openings in}} margins or tips of leaves.The water {{flows through the}} xylem to its endings in the leaf and then through the intercellular spaces of the hydathode tissue toward the openings in the epidermis. Strictly speaking, such hydathodes are not glands because they are passive {{with regard to the}} flow of water.|$|E
5000|$|Hydathodes are {{involved}} in the process of <b>guttation,</b> in which positive xylem pressure (due to root pressure) causes liquid to exude from the pores.

Hydathodes are of two types: ...|$|E
50|$|Imidacloprid is a nicotine-derived {{systemic}} insecticide, {{belonging to}} a group of pesticides called neonicotinoids. Although it is off patent, the primary producer of imidacloprid is the German chemical firm Bayer CropScience. The trade names for imidacloprid include Gaucho, Admire, Merit, Advantage, Confidor, Provado, and Winner. Imidacloprid is a neurotoxin that is selectively toxic to insects relative to vertebrates and most non-insect invertebrates. It acts as an agonist on the postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of motor neurones in insects. This interaction results in convulsions, paralysis, and eventually death of the poisoned insect. It is effective on contact and via stomach action. Because imidacloprid binds much more strongly to insect neuron receptors than to mammal neuron receptors, this insecticide is selectively more toxic to insects than mammals. As a systemic pesticide, imidacloprid translocates or moves readily in the xylem of plants from the soil into the leaves, fruit, flowers, pollen, nectar, and <b>guttation</b> fluid of plants. Bees may be exposed to imidacloprid when they feed on the nectar, pollen, and <b>guttation</b> fluid of imidacloprid-treated plants.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, the German Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety {{decided to}} {{continue}} to suspend authorization for clothianidin use on corn. It {{had not yet been}} fully clarified to what extent and in what manner bees come into contact with the active substances in clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid when used on corn. The question of whether liquid emitted by plants via <b>guttation,</b> which bees ingest, posed an additional risk was unanswered.|$|E
5000|$|The {{primary source}} of {{inoculum}} is Xcc infected seed. During germination, the seedling becomes infected through the epicotyl [...] and cotyledons may develop blackened margins, shrivel, and drop. The bacteria progress through the vascular system to the young stems and leaves, where the disease manifests as V-shaped chlorotic to necrotic lesions extending from the leaf margins. Under humid conditions, bacteria present in <b>guttation</b> droplets can be spread by wind, rain, water splashes, and mechanical equipment to neighboring plants.|$|E
50|$|At night, {{transpiration}} {{usually does}} not occur because most plants have their stomata closed. When {{there is a high}} soil moisture level, water will enter plant roots, because the water potential of the roots is lower than in the soil solution. The water will accumulate in the plant, creating a slight root pressure. The root pressure forces some water to exude through special leaf tip or edge structures, hydathodes or water glands, forming drops. Root pressure provides the impetus for this flow, rather than transpirational pull. <b>Guttation</b> is most noticeable when transpiration is suppressed and the relative humidity is high, such as during the night.|$|E
50|$|Of equal {{importance}} to the storage and movement of water in soil is {{the means by which}} plants acquire it and their nutrients. Ninety percent of water is taken up by plants as passive absorption caused by the pulling force of water evaporating (transpiring) from the long column of water that leads from the plant's roots to its leaves. In addition, the high concentration of salts within plant roots creates an osmotic pressure gradient that pushes soil water into the roots. Osmotic absorption becomes more important during times of low water transpiration caused by lower temperatures (for example at night) or high humidity. It is the process that causes <b>guttation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Typically {{leaves are}} broad, flat and thin (dorsiventrally flattened), thereby {{maximising}} {{the surface area}} directly exposed to light and enabling the light to penetrate the tissues and reach the chloroplasts, thus promoting photosynthesis. They are arranged on the plant so as to expose their surfaces to light as efficiently as possible without shading each other, {{but there are many}} exceptions and complications. For instance plants adapted to windy conditions may have pendent leaves, such as in many willows and eucalyptss. The flat, or laminar, shape also maximises thermal contact with the surrounding air, promoting cooling. Functionally, in addition to photosynthesis the leaf is the principal site of transpiration and <b>guttation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Root {{pressure}} {{occurs in}} the xylem of some vascular plants when the soil moisture level is high either at night or when transpiration is low during the day. When transpiration is high, xylem sap is usually under tension, rather than under pressure, due to transpirational pull. At night in some plants, root pressure causes <b>guttation</b> or exudation of drops of xylem sap from the tips or edges of leaves. Root pressure is studied by removing the shoot of a plant near the soil level. Xylem sap will exude from the cut stem for hours or days due to root pressure. If a pressure gauge {{is attached to the}} cut stem, the root pressure can be measured.|$|E
5000|$|Root pressure: If {{the water}} {{potential}} of the root cells is more negative {{than that of the}} soil, usually due to high concentrations of solute, water can move by osmosis into the root from the soil. This causes a positive pressure that forces sap up the xylem towards the leaves. In some circumstances, the sap will be forced from the leaf through a hydathode in a phenomenon known as <b>guttation.</b> Root pressure is highest in the morning before the stomata open and allow transpiration to begin. Different plant species can have different root pressures even in a similar environment; examples include up to 145 kPa in Vitis riparia but around zero in Celastrus orbiculatus.|$|E
50|$|Neonicotinoids {{are highly}} toxic {{to a range}} of insects, {{including}} honey bees and other pollinators. They are taken up by a plant’s vascular system and expressed through pollen, nectar and <b>guttation</b> droplets from which bees forage and drink. They are particularly dangerous because, in addition to being acutely toxic in high doses, they also result in serious sub-lethal effects when insects are exposed to chronic low doses, as they are through pollen and water droplets laced with the chemical as well as dust that is released into the air when coated seeds are planted. These effects cause significant problems for the health of individual honey bees as well as the overall health of honey bee colonies and they include disruptions in mobility, navigation, feeding behavior, foraging activity, memory and learning, and overall hive activity.|$|E
50|$|The {{shape and}} {{structure}} of leaves vary considerably from species to species of plant, depending largely on their adaptation to climate and available light, but also to other factors such as grazing animals (such as deer), available nutrients, and ecological competition from other plants. Considerable changes in leaf type occur within species too, for example as a plant matures; as {{a case in point}} Eucalyptus species commonly have isobilateral, pendent leaves when mature and dominating their neighbours; however, such trees tend to have erect or horizontal dorsiventral leaves as seedlings, when their growth is limited by the available light. Other factors include the need to balance water loss at high temperature and low humidity against the need to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide. In most plants leaves also are the primary organs responsible for transpiration and <b>guttation</b> (beads of fluid forming at leaf margins).|$|E
50|$|A {{classical}} {{device for}} dew measurement is the drosometer. A small, artificial condenser surface is suspended from an arm {{attached to a}} pointer or a pen that records the weight changes of the condenser on a drum. Besides being very wind sensitive, however, this, like all artificial surface devices, only provides {{a measure of the}} meteorological potential for dew formation. The actual amount of dew in a specific place is strongly dependent on surface properties. For its measurement, plants, leaves, or whole soil columns are placed on a balance with their surface at the same height and in the same surroundings as would occur naturally, thus providing a small lysimeter. Further methods include estimation by means of comparing the droplets to standardized photographs, or volumetric measurement of the amount of water wiped from the surface. Some of these methods include <b>guttation,</b> while others only measure dewfall and/or distillation.|$|E
5000|$|Dollar Spot's {{occurrence}} {{and severity}} can be minimized through cultural practices. By minimizing leaf wetness via sound irrigation practices, the environment becomes less favorable for the pathogen to infect. Irrigation {{should be applied}} deeply and infrequently. Irrigation events should not occur {{in the late afternoon}} or evening, as this prolongs leaf wetness and may intensify disease. Removing dew and <b>guttation</b> fluids from the canopy can help lessen disease severity. This can be accomplished by mowing, rolling, [...] "dew-whipping," [...] or dragging a rope across the turf. Provide adequate air circulation by removing trees or installing large fans. Aerification and thatch removal are valuable tools; relieving compaction and thatch buildup allows the soil and canopy to dry more quickly. Light, frequent applications of nitrogen enhance the recuperative ability of the plant, allowing the turf to hide the symptoms of dollar spot and recover from any damage sustained.|$|E
50|$|Green plants produce {{carbon dioxide}} and water as {{respiratory}} products. In green plants, the carbon dioxide released during respiration gets utilized during photosynthesis. Oxygen is a by product generated during photosynthesis, and exits through stomata, root cell walls, and other routes. Plants {{can get rid of}} excess water by transpiration and <b>guttation.</b> It has been shown that the leaf acts as an 'excretophore' and, {{in addition to being a}} primary organ of photosynthesis, is also used as a method of excreting toxic wastes via diffusion. Other waste materials that are exuded by some plants — resin, saps, latex, etc. are forced from the interior of the plant by hydrostatic pressures inside the plant and by absorptive forces of plant cells. These latter processes do not need added energy, they act passively. However, during the pre-abscission phase, the metabolic levels of a leaf are high. Plants also excrete some waste substances into the soil around them.|$|E
50|$|Zantedeschia {{species are}} rhizomatous, herbaceous, {{perennial}} plants with some species, e. g., Zantedeschia aethiopica, growing to 1.2m tall, while Zantedeschia rehmannii does not exceed 60 cm in height, growing in clumps or clusters.Roots: Contractile, {{emerging from the}} top of the tubers in Group II.Stem: The underground portion is variously described as a thick underground stem, i. e., a rhizome or tuber. While the literature is confusing as to the exact terminology, generally the Zantedeschia aethiopica-Zantedeschia odorata group (Group I) is considered to have rhizomes and the remaining species tubers. The rhizomes are fleshy and branched. Leaves: Petioles are long, spongy, sheathed at the bases, and of varying lengths, from 15 cm (Zantedeschia rehmannii) to 1.5 m (Zantedeschia aethiopica). The lamina is simple, elongated, and coriaceous with a variety of shapes, including triangular, oval (ovate), with or without a point (elliptic), heart-shaped (cordate), spear-shaped (hastate), lance-shaped (lanceolate), oblong, or circular (orbicular). 15-60 cm in length, 5-25 cm in width. The leaves are dark green in colour, feather-veined (pinnate), and may be erect or spreading with undulate margins. Some species exhibit transparent flecking (maculation), and are therefore described as maculate, while others are immaculate. (see Table I, also New Zealand Calla Council Leaf Shape Images) The leaves contain hydathodes that result in <b>guttation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Transpiration is {{the process}} of water {{movement}} through a plant and its evaporation from aerial parts, such as leaves, stems and flowers. Water is necessary for plants but only a small amount of water taken up by the roots is used for growth and metabolism. The remaining 97-99.5% is lost by transpiration and <b>guttation.</b> Leaf surfaces are dotted with pores called stomata, and in most plants they are more numerous on the undersides of the foliage. The stomata are bordered by guard cells and their stomatal accessory cells (together known as stomatal complex) that open and close the pore. Transpiration occurs through the stomatal apertures, and {{can be thought of as}} a necessary [...] "cost" [...] associated with the opening of the stomata to allow the diffusion of carbon dioxide gas from the air for photosynthesis. Transpiration also cools plants, changes osmotic pressure of cells, and enables mass flow of mineral nutrients and water from roots to shoots. Two major factors influence the rate of water flow from the soil to the roots: the hydraulic conductivity of the soil and the magnitude of the pressure gradient through the soil. Both of these factors influence the rate of bulk flow of water moving from the roots to the stomatal pores in the leaves via the xylem.|$|E
40|$|Background: In crops of {{economic}} relevance and some common weeds in Germany, several glasshouse and field trials were {{conducted at the}} JKI and cooperating research partners (DWD, IfZ, BDP and UFOP) from 2009 to 2011. Aim of the investigations was to analyze the <b>guttation</b> frequency of these crops, to document climatic conditions that trigger <b>guttation</b> and to describe {{the quality and quantity}} of <b>guttation</b> events (e. g. size/number of drops). Results: <b>Guttation</b> occurred in all crops mainly at young growth stages. Only maize, cucumber, oilseed rape and potato produced <b>guttation</b> droplets until emergence of inflorescence. The excreted amount of fluid was comparable for maize and oilseed rape but considerably lower for sugar beet and barley. In field situation <b>guttation</b> occurred frequently in more than one plant species in parallel when it was not dry or too windy or frosty. Conclusion: Monocotyledonous crops and weeds showed a higher <b>guttation</b> frequency than most dicotyledonous crops. Maize showed large <b>guttation</b> drops even under low relative air humidity, whereas <b>guttation</b> drops in sugar beets were much smaller and only observed under very high humidity conditions (> 90 %). Other dicotyledonous crops, such as oilseed rape and potato, showed a much higher <b>guttation</b> frequency than sugar beets...|$|E
40|$|Background: Besides their nectar and pollen {{collecting}} activities, {{honey bees}} also forage water. <b>Guttation</b> droplets {{may be used}} as a water source. Measurements of high residue levels of some intrinsically highly toxic, systemic insecticides in <b>guttation</b> droplets triggered research activities on the potential risk for honey bees. Since 2009, a large number of studies have been conducted on the environmental conditions and factors favoring <b>guttation,</b> foraging of <b>guttation,</b> the occurrence of <b>guttation</b> in different crops, the frequency of <b>guttation</b> events and residue measurements in <b>guttation</b> droplets in different crops, at different growth stages and with different active ingredients. Different approaches of laboratory, semi-field and field studies were set up to address the potential risk of <b>guttation</b> to bees and to gain clarification whether and how this concern would need to be specifically addressed in the risk assessment for bees. Results: Occasionally increased mortalities of worker bees were reported from single events in some trials, when colonies were placed directly next to the sown maize crop treated with a systemic insecticide. However, there were no long-term colony effects (e. g. on colony strength and brood development) reported from any of the realistic worst case exposure trials conducted by either public research institutes or industry. Conclusion: The potential risk for bees is in the first instance dependent on the distance of the colonies to treated crops. Maize is considered as the worst case crop in terms of frequency, duration and intensity of <b>guttation</b> and of residue level of compounds found in <b>guttation</b> liquid. Though increased worker bee mortality on individual days was seen in some of the field studies where hives were placed directly at guttating maize fields, adverse effects to colony vitality, colony and brood development were never observed...|$|E
40|$|Although root {{pressure}} and <b>guttation</b> presumably {{result from a}} high concentration of salt in the root xylem, the <b>guttation</b> fluid is very dilute. Measurements of the osmotic potential of the <b>guttation</b> liquid and of exudates at various levels in guttating plants indicate that salt is removed from the xylem in the upper part of plants, particularly in the leaves. The concentration of salt solutions forced through individual leaves by an artificial root pressure has no influence on the osmotic potential of the <b>guttation</b> fluid. This suggests that leaves {{play an important role in}} removing salt from the xylem of guttating plants...|$|E
40|$|<b>Guttation</b> is a {{physiological}} phenomenon resulting in oozing of drops of xylem sap on the tips or edges of leaves of some vascular plants. Of 11 species belonging to different botanical families, only rice (Oryza sativa L.) {{was found to}} guttate heavily. Therefore, the process of <b>guttation</b> in rice was studied in depth. <b>Guttation</b> was found to occur from margins, tips, adaxial and abaxial surfaces of leaves. It was the leaf margins that exuded most (151 μl), followed by adaxial surface (135 μl), and tips (98 μl), in that order. Further, the “ridged” portions exuded more fluid than “smooth” portions of the same leaf blade. The rate of <b>guttation</b> was 132 μl at anthesis, 120 μl at tillering, 112 μl at heading and milky stages, and 42 μl at dough stage. The wind velocity and soil moisture stress, as external factors, played dominant roles in the regulation of <b>guttation.</b> Genotypic variability existed for <b>guttation</b> among six cultivars, with cv. NDRH- 2 registering the highest value of 110 μl and Mahsuri the lowest (62 μl). The guttational rates exhibited by various cultivars were positively correlated with their panicle weights, i. e., the yield sink capacity, which {{may be used as}} a selection criterion for breeding for enhanced yield. These findings on various aspects of <b>guttation</b> in rice are novel. The information should be useful to breeders for creating a new efficient rice plant having altered genetic makeup for increased <b>guttation</b> for yield improvement...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Guttation</b> is {{a natural}} botanical {{phenomenon}} and describes the active excretion of liquid water (<b>guttation</b> fluid) by some vascular plants in form of droplets on the tips of leaves or on leaf edges. <b>Guttation</b> fluid may contain neonicotinoid residues after plant uptake from seed treatments. To clarify {{the relevance of the}} <b>guttation</b> fluid as a water source for honey bee colonies and to assess potential associated risks under conditions of agronomic practice, various studies were performed in key broad acre crops such as maize, sugar beet, potato (in-furrow application), winter barley and oilseed rape by placing honeybee colonies adjacent to freshly emerged fields for several weeks and by following up potential lethal and sub-lethal effects, as well as potential effects on colony performance. Results: <b>Guttation</b> droplets contained peak residue levels theoretically capable of harming individual honeybees (i. e. several hundred ppm). Residue levels, however, generally decreased with time, as expected based on the physiological process involved.

40|$|Regarding the {{hypothesis}} that neonicotinoid insecticides used for seed coating of agricultural crops mainly corn, sunflower and seed rape - {{are related to the}} extensive death of honey bees, the phenomenon of corn seedling <b>guttation</b> has been recently considered as a possible route of exposure of bees to these systemic insecticides. In the present study, <b>guttation</b> drops of corn plants obtained from commercial seeds coated with thiamethoxam, clothianidin, imidacloprid and fipronil have been analyzed by an optimized fast UHPLC-DAD procedure showing excellent detection limits and accuracy, both adequate for the purpose. The young plants grown both in pots - in greenhouse - and in open field from coated seeds, produced <b>guttation</b> solutions containing high levels of the neonicotinoid insecticides (up to 346 mg L(- 1) for imidacloprid, 102 mg L(- 1) for clothianidin and 146 mg L(- 1) for thiamethoxam). These concentration levels may represent lethal doses for bees that use <b>guttation</b> drops as a source of water. The neonicotinoid concentrations in <b>guttation</b> drops progressively decrease during the first 10 - 15 days after the emergence of the plant from the soil. Otherwise fipronil, which is a non-systemic phenylpyrazole insecticide, was never detected into <b>guttation</b> drops. Current results confirm that the physiological fluids of the corn plant can effectively transfer neonicotinoid insecticides from the seed onto the surface of the leaves, where <b>guttation</b> drops may expose bees and other insects to elevated doses of neurotoxic insecticides...|$|E
40|$|Mature {{leaves of}} field-grown eddo plants {{were used for}} observing {{hydathode}} morphology by light and scanning electron microscopies. There were approximately five hydathode pores on the adaxial surface of each leaf tip. A ring structure with two borders around the pore was detected in this study. Further observations revealed a large cavity underneath the pores. The cavity was directly connected to vascular bundles that lacked a bundle sheath, via intercellular spaces among loosely organized parenchyma cells. Many crystal cells were present around the cavity and vascular bundles. To evaluate the role of <b>guttation</b> in sodium excretion under salinity stress, eddo plants were grown in hydroponic solutions containing 0, 1, 4, 8, and 12  mM sodium chloride (NaCl) for 7 d. As the NaCl concentration in the hydroponic solution increased, the sodium contents increased in leaf blades, petioles, and roots but remained unchanged in corms. The sodium concentration in the <b>guttation</b> fluid increased; however, the volume of <b>guttation</b> fluid decreased with increasing NaCl concentrations. Therefore, sodium elimination via <b>guttation</b> decreased with increasing NaCl concentrations. The ratios of the sodium content in <b>guttation</b> fluid to that of leaf blades, leaves, and whole plants decreased with increasing NaCl concentrations. The ratios of potassium to sodium contents in leaves, roots, and <b>guttation</b> fluid also decreased as the NaCl concentration increased. These results indicate that <b>guttation</b> did not eliminate sufficient sodium {{to play a role}} in adjusting sodium homeostasis and the ratios of potassium to sodium contents in eddo plants under saline conditions...|$|E
40|$|Growth and {{survival}} of Xanthomonas campestris pv. dieffenbachiae in <b>guttation</b> fluids (xylem sap exuded from leaf margins) of anthuriums were suppressed by several bacterial strains indigenous to leaves of various anthurium cultivars. Inhibition of growth {{was not observed}} in filter-sterilized <b>guttation</b> fluids and was restored to original levels only by reintroducing specific mixtures of bacteria into filter-sterilized <b>guttation</b> fluids. The inhibitory effect {{was related to the}} species in the bacterial community rather than to the total numbers of bacteria in the <b>guttation</b> fluids. One very effective bacterial community consisted of five species isolated from inhibitory <b>guttation</b> fluids of two susceptible anthurium cultivars. The individual strains in this community had no effect on the pathogen, but the mixture was inhibitory to X. campestris pv. dieffenbachiae in <b>guttation</b> fluids. The populations of the individual strains remained near the initial inoculum levels for at least 14 days. The effect of the five inhibitory strains on reducing disease in susceptible anthurium plants was tested by using a bioluminescent strain of X. campestris pv. dieffenbachiae to monitor the progression of disease in leaves nondestructively. Invasion of the pathogen through hydathodes at leaf margins was reduced by applying the strain mixture to the leaves. When the strain mixture was applied directly to wounds created on the leaf margins, the pathogen failed to invade through the wounds.

40|$|Background: Depending on the location, various {{water sources}} may be {{available}} for bee colonies. These sources can be permanent, such as ponds, or incidental like dew or <b>guttation</b> droplets. The aim of the experiment was to investigate whether bees prefer <b>guttation</b> drops as a water source compared to dew or rain drops. Furthermore it was analysed if bees use these water sources up to a distance of 50 m from their hives. Results: During the experiment 147 bees were observed scanning {{the surface of the}} plants without landing, 13 bees took up <b>guttation</b> fluid and 36 bees collected dew or rain drops. Few bees were observed collecting <b>guttation</b> fluid at 50 m from their hives but most in close proximity of the hives. Furthermore, in some dead bees residues of the seed treatment were detected (imazalil: 0. 0011 μg/bee – 0. 329 μg/bee; LD 50 = 35. 1 μg/bee). Conclusion: In the majority of observations, bees were spotted scanning the leaf area of the plants. Only single bees were observed that actually took up water from plant leaves. It seems these bees did not distinguish between dew, rain or <b>guttation</b> droplets. The majority of water collecting or bees resting on plants were observed in the close proximity of their hives...|$|E
40|$|The {{death of}} honey bees, Apis mellifera L., and the {{consequent}} colony collapse disorder causes major losses in agriculture and plant pollination worldwide. The phenomenon showed increasing rates in the past years, although its causes are still awaiting a clear answer. Although neonicotinoid systemic insecticides used for seed coating of agricultural crops were suspected as possible reason, studies so far have not shown the existence of unquestionable sources capable of delivering directly intoxicating doses in the Þelds. <b>Guttation</b> is a natural plant phenomenon causing the excretion of xylem ßuid at leaf margins. Here, we show that leaf <b>guttation</b> drops of all the corn plants germinated from neonicotinoid-coated seeds contained amounts of insecticide constantly higher than 10 mg/l, with maxima up to 100 mg/l for thiamethoxam and clothianidin, and up to 200 mg/l for imidacloprid. The concentration of neonicotinoids in <b>guttation</b> drops can be near those of active ingredients commonly applied in Þeld sprays for pest control, or even higher.

40|$|Acropetal {{mass flow}} of water is {{demonstrated}} in two submerged angiosperms, Lobelia dortmanna L. and Sparganium emersum Rehman by means of <b>guttation</b> measurements. Transpiration is absent in truly submerged plants, but the presence of <b>guttation</b> verifies that long-distance water transport takes place. Use of tritiated water showed that the water current arises from the roots, and the main {{flow of water}} is channeled to the youngest leaves. This was confirmed by measurement of <b>guttation,</b> which showed the highest rates in young leaves. <b>Guttation</b> rates were 10 -fold larger in the youngest leaf of S. emersum (2. 1 [mu]L leaf- 1 h- 1) compared with the youngest leaf of L. dortmanna (0. 2 [mu]L leaf- 1 h- 1). This is probably due to profound species differences in the hydraulic conductance (2. 7 x 10 - 17 m 4 Pa- 1 s- 1 for S. emersum and 1. 4 x 10 - 19 m 4 Pa- 1 s- 1 for L. dortmanna). Estimates derived from the modified Hagen-Poiseuille equation showed that the maximum flow velocity in xylem vessels was 23 to 84 cm h- 1, and the required root pressure to drive the flow was small compared to that commonly found in terrestrial plants. In S. emersum long-distance transport of water was shown {{to be dependent on}} energy conversion in the roots. The leaves ceased to guttate when the roots were cooled to 4 [deg]C from the acclimatization level at 15 [deg]C, whereas the <b>guttation</b> was stimulated when the temperature was increased to 25 [deg]C. Also, the <b>guttation</b> rate decreased significantly when vanadate was added to the root medium. The observed water transport is probably a general phenomenon in submerged plants, where it can act as a translocation system for nutrients taken up from the rich root medium and thereby assure maximum growth...|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the CROSTVOC (CROp STress VOC) project, the exchange of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) between two important agricultural crop species, maize and winter wheat, and the atmosphere has recently been measured during an entire growing season by using the eddy covariance technique. Because of the co-variation of BVOC emission drivers in field conditions, laboratory studies were initiated in an environmental chamber in order to disentangle the responses of the emissions to variations of the individual environmental parameters (such as PPFD and temperature) and to diverse abiotic stress factors. Young plants were enclosed in transparent all-Teflon dynamic enclosures (cuvettes) through which BVOC-free and RH-controlled air was sent. BVOC enriched air was subsequently sampled from the plant cuvettes and an empty cuvette (background) and analyzed for BVOCs in a high sensitivity Proton-Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer (hs-PTR-MS) and for CO 2 in a LI- 7000 non-dispersive IR gas analyzer. Emissions were monitored at constant temperature (25 °C) and at a stepwise varying PPFD pattern (0 - 650 µmol m- 2 s- 1). For maize plants, sudden light/dark transitions {{at the end of the}} photoperiod were accompanied by prompt and considerable increases in methanol (m/z 33) and water vapor (m/z 39) emissions. Moreover, <b>guttation</b> droplets appeared on the sides and the tips of the leaves within a few minutes after light/dark transition. Therefore the assumption has been raised that methanol is also coming out with <b>guttation</b> fluid from the leaves. Consequently, <b>guttation</b> fluid was collected from young maize and wheat plants, injected in an empty enclosure and sampled by PTR-MS. Methanol and a large number of other compounds were observed from <b>guttation</b> fluid. Recent studies have shown that <b>guttation</b> from agricultural crops frequently occurs in field conditions. Further research is required to find out the source strength of methanol emissions by this <b>guttation</b> phenomenon in real environmental conditions...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of {{amino acids}} in the <b>guttation</b> fluid {{and in the}} xylem exudates of cut leaves from intact plants provide {{evidence}} of the remarkable efficiency with which these nitrogenous compounds are reabsorbed from the xylem sap. This could be achieved by mechanisms involving intercellular transport and/or metabolism. Developmental changes in transcripts and protein showed that transcripts for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) increased from the base to the leaf tip, and were markedly increased by supplying asparagine. Supplying amino acids also increased the amounts of protein of PEPCK and, to a lesser extent, of pyruvate, Pi dikinase. PEPCK {{is present in the}} hydathodes, stomata and vascular parenchyma of rice leaves. Evidence for the role of PEPCK was obtained by using 3 -mercaptopicolinic acid (MPA), a specific inhibitor of PEPCK, and by using an activation-tagged rice line that had an increase in PEPCK activity, to show that activation of PEPCK resulted in a decrease in N in the <b>guttation</b> fluid and that treatment by MPA resulted in an increase in amino acids in the <b>guttation</b> fluid and xylem sap towards the leaf tip. Furthermore, increasing PEPCK activity decreased the amount of <b>guttation</b> fluid, whereas decreasing PEPCK activity increased the amount of xylem sap or <b>guttation</b> fluid towards the leaf tip. The findings suggest the following hypotheses: (i) both metabolism and transport are involved in xylem recycling and (ii) excess N is the signal involved in modulating xylem hydraulics, perhaps via nutrient regulation of water-transporting aquaporins. Water relations and vascular metabolism and transport are thus intimately linked...|$|E
