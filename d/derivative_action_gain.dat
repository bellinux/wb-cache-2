(2007), stabilizing PID controllers {{for a class}} of unstable plants with time delays (I/O delays) are obtained. By utilizing this approach and methods given in Özbay and Gündeş (2007, 2014) we aim to investigate appropriate PI, PD and PID controllers by finding the maximum allowable boundaries for each controller parameter. A model of a flexible robot arm which includes a time delay and an integrator is considered as an application example. It is aimed to find the optimal coefficients for the derivative and integral gains such that the designs achieve a set of performance and robustness objectives. Stability and robustness properties of the closed-loop system are also investigated. Specifically, for PD controller design, optimal <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> <b>gain</b> is determined under various performance objectives. For PI controller design, optimal P (proportional) and D (derivative) gains are determined to achieve the least fragile integral action gain. Moreover, system performance is compared with other PID designs considering different types of control objectives. by Gökçe Kuralay. M. S...|$|E

40|$|Even though PID {{control has}} been {{available}} for a long time, there are still no tuning methods including <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> that have <b>gained</b> wide acceptance in industry. Also, {{there is still no}} general consensus for when one should use PID, PI or even I control on a process.

The proposed PID design procedure uses a software-based method to find controllers with optimal or near optimal load disturbance response subject to robustness and noise sensitivity constraints. It is shown that the optimal controller type depends on maximum allowed noise sensitivity as well as process dynamics. The design procedure thus results in a set of PID, PI and I controllers with different noise filters that the user can switch between to reach an acceptable control signal activity. The software is also used to compare PI and PID control performance with equivalent noise sensitivity and robustness over a large batch of processes representative for the process industry. This can be used to show how much a particular process benefits from using the derivative part...|$|R

40|$|The {{enactment}} of <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> {{was expected to}} be actively used by shareholders to protect their interests. In fact, it turned out that this reform effort seemed futile as the right to engage in such actions was rarely exercised. This raises a question about the role of <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> in China; namely, should a <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> system {{play a key role in}} protecting shareholder interests? If the answer is positive, the next question is how such a system could be improved in order to effectively discipline management. The essence of this thesis is to try to address these issues. This thesis argues that <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> should and can play a key role in China’s corporate governance. First, minority shareholders in China face double agency problems within the company and thus protective mechanisms must be put in place. Second, this thesis formulates its argument by demonstrating the ineffectiveness of market forces and other legal methods. As a consequence, <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> ought to retain a central role in regulating the misbehaviour of controlling shareholders and managers. After demonstrating the need to strengthen and improve <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> in China, this thesis starts to explore Chinas’ <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> system. It first examines <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> cases before Company Law 2005. Despite the absence of a clear statutory basis for <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> in Company Law 1993, such cases have nevertheless appeared in the courts. After almost eight years of implementation, less than 80 cases were raised. Whilst this seems a good figure in comparison to other jurisdictions, closer examination shows this not to be the case. For example, the opacity of the demand requirement constitutes a barrier for shareholders wishing to exercise this right. More importantly, the funding rule of <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> is treated as the same with other forms of litigation. In view of the unique economic nature of the <b>derivative</b> <b>action,</b> a new funding rule for <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> should be established. After discussing why <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> should play a significant role in monitoring management and how they should be improved, this thesis argues that shareholders are increasingly willing to take this action to protect their rights and interests because of the establishment of commercial society and the existence of the traditional culture of Legalist School. Also, the courts are more capable of dealing with <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> cases because of the {{enactment of}} the Judges Law and the increasing recruitment of more qualified people to the judiciary. It is believed that the effectiveness of <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> can contribute to foster good corporate governance in China...|$|R

In so doing I will be examining the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> procedure from its inception in the common law through to the current dispensation. This dissertation describes and explains the rights, interests and obligations of shareholders and will explore the pitfalls for shareholders {{in the implementation of}} the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> as a protective measure. I submit that the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> found under the common law and the previous statutory regime provided the stepping stone in molding the statutory <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> evidenced by section 165 of the Companies Act. In Chapter 1, I explore the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> under the common law as a conceptual framework and as a movement that initially arose in the renowned case of Foss v Harbottle. Whose core principles were subsequently embraced by the South African judiciary. In Chapter 2 I discuss the availability of the statutory <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> and the limitations of section 266. Further, I make a comparative study between the common law and the statutory <b>derivative</b> <b>action.</b> The comparison is essential in an attempt to portray that the statutory <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> refined the common law to a certain extent in its attempts to provide a minority shareholder protective measure. In chapter 3 I examine section 165 of the Companies Act to evaluate to what degree the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> has transformed against the backdrop of its statutory predecessor and the common law. This chapter breaks down the constituent principles of section 165 and examines the requirements necessary to implement the measure. Finally, in Chapter 4 I make a comparative study with foreign jurisdictions to determine the extent, if any, section 165 relates to the principles laid down in other jurisdictions.

40|$|<b>Derivative</b> <b>actions</b> {{were just}} newly {{introduced}} into Vietnamese company law in 2010. Adoption of the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> is a strike signal of Vietnam&# 039;s affiliation to the litigation bandwagon of East Asia countries. However, {{differ from the}} Asian countries where matters of derivative actions&# 039; transplantation and their functioning are oft-debated topics of corporate governance literature, the discussion has not begun yet in Vietnam. In fact, the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> was adopted without a domestic academic debate {{to pave the way}} for its introduction. The lack of discussion on the one hand would troublesome those who want to review the transplantation of the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> to Vietnam. On the other hand, this absence would detach the Vietnamese academic debate from on-going international debate. Seeking the possible explanations for absence of such debate is the first aim of this article. Towards this end, the article proposes three assumptions which help to explain why the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> has never been widely discussed in Vietnam before its introduction. Such assumptions enables us to better understand the context in which the action was introduced. Moreover, the assumptions are hints for us to predict feasibility of the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> in the jurisdiction.

40|$|<b>Derivative</b> <b>action</b> is a {{means of}} {{enforcing}} directors to carry out their fiduciary duties to a company through judicial resolutions. Such a private enforcement is one of the essential mechanisms that reduce agency costs in a mature market economy. The institution of <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> originated from the British equity law, and was further developed and implemented in the United States. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Mainland China all introduced <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> one after the other. Among the transplanted countries, Japan experienced a sharp increase of <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> in the 1990 s, while the other countries had fewer derivative cases. This thesis first focuses on the popularity of <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> in Japan in the 1990 s by discussing the legal framework, social and economic backgrounds, and interconnected institutions related to <b>derivative</b> <b>action,</b> {{in order to determine the}} incentives for shareholders to sue. Professor Mark D. West, Professor Dan W. Puchniak and Professor Shiro Kawashima all conducted in-depth research and made outstanding contributions on this issue. West believed the direct benefits to Japanese attorneys led to the advent of <b>derivative</b> <b>actions,</b> while Puchniak disagreed, and indicated that shareholders and their attorneys in carrying out <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> are irrational and not economically motivated. Kawashima gave more attention to the social aspects of that period of time and inferred that a series of social events triggered the interest to sue. Through a study on the degree of the development in <b>derivative</b> <b>actions,</b> as well as the related features and changes in Japan, my conclusion is that the establishment of self-reinforcing and interconnected institutions led to path dependence on <b>derivative</b> <b>action,</b> which is the real reason for the popularity of <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> in Japan. Specifically, the crucial self-reinforcing institutions that contribute to the significant increase in <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> comprise the common fund principle, which provides indemnity for the litigation costs of plaintiff shareholders when they win a case; the contingency fee arrangement, which transfers litigation risks from plaintiffs to their attorneys; and the discovery rule, which facilitates the access of plaintiffs to corporate internal information. The conclusion is drawn from the path dependence theory, in that the consolidation of any initial path requires the support of the interconnected institutions, especially those with a self-reinforcing nature. This explanation goes beyond the case of Japan, and can also account for the case of China. Introduced in 2006, the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> in China has been modest, with around 10 cases per year. However, after studying the Chinese legal framework of <b>derivative</b> <b>action,</b> I have found an intriguing item, that among all of the derivative suits, only one involved a publicly held company. A cost-benefit analysis has indicated that there is a serious lack of incentives for shareholders in publicly held companies and their attorneys to sue because of the imbalance between litigation costs and benefits. Again, the reluctance to sue is found to originate from the incomplete interconnectedness of institutions based on the path dependence theory. Finally, the experience of Japan can be viewed as an example of establishing these critical self-reinforcing institutions. published_or_final_versionLawMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{one of the}} thorniest aspects {{in company}} law: the <b>derivative</b> <b>action.</b> As {{an exception to the}} rule in Foss v. Harbottle, individual shareholders can, acting on behalf of a company, sue the company’s director if a wrong is done to the company. Private shareholders’ action has been a major landscape in corporate governance in the US, but not in the UK. (Armour et al, 2007) Recently, the law on <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> has experienced significant changes with the codification adopted in many jurisdictions. It is doubtful as to whether <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> are a useful mechanism to enhance investor protection. Chinese companies have been widely conceived as having a blockholder model, in which the state as the controlling shareholder should in theory possess the incentives to constrain the opportunistic behavior of managers. Nonetheless, the state, as loosely defined as “people as a whole”, has failed to exercise any effective monitoring role. The introduction of the statutory <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> in 2005 is a significant experiment to establish an investor-friendly legal regime. However, during the transplantation of western law into China, there are several fundamental problems that need to be properly dealt with so as to allow the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> to function effectively. The paper begins by examining the role of <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> in China, then reviews Chinese <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> system with respect to substantive law and enforcement, and discusses the inadequacies of the present system such as costly litigation expenses and ambiguous procedures.

40|$|This {{thesis of}} 98, 273 words is {{concerned}} with one of company law's most thorny aspects: the <b>derivative</b> <b>action.</b> The thesis has both a positive and a normative dimension. It takes a position about the role that <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> litigation should have in the corporate governance matrix. This is {{the realm of the}} normative, the domain of what some political philosophers call 'ideal theory'. However the analysis here aims not to be merely a philosophical flight of fantasy about how things ought to be, but rather aims to provide insight into current practice and to suggest substantive viable improvements. In view of this, this analysis can be used both to understand substantial and procedural rules governing the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> and judicial decisions in this area, and to suggest how problems should be resolved in the future, judicially and legislatively. First, the thesis attempts a fundamental rethink of the content of the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> and its objectives. It attempts to clarify the nature of the action and the circumstances in which its application may be deemed propitious. The thesis then focuses on and examines the conditions that may produce a positive inducement to litigate. It expresses a view on what might be the optimal level of such litigation with a view to enhancing the potential effectiveness of the action. Crucially, it strongly links the actual viability of <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> to funding mechanisms, namely developing adequate means to fund <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> so as to make them worthwhile financially. Finally, the thesis argues that it is vital to clarify the interaction between the primary remedies available to shareholders. More specifically, the thesis calls for action on three complementary levels, namely, conceptual the adoption of a new framework in the guise of the Functional and Focused Model ('FFM') to govern <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> litigation; strategic the employment of appropriate incentives and fee rules which advance the premises behind the FFM; and, finally, maintaining doctrinal consistency - by clarifying the interaction between the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> and the unfair prejudice remedy. </p...|$|R
40|$|This article {{challenges}} the commonly expressed view that shareholders wishing {{to bring a}} <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> {{on behalf of the}} company must have 'clean hands' i. e. that there must be nothing in the shareholders behaviour which renders it unjust to allow the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> to proceed. While minority shareholders' misbehaviour might well have consequences for themselves, such as requiring the repayment of dividends known to have been paid unlawfully, those actions ought, in the normal course of events, to be irrelevant for the purpose of deciding whether to allow a <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> to proceed. This article suggests some circumstances in which a minority shareholder's situation or actions may affect the decision to allow a <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> brought by that particular shareholder to proceed, but these do not spring from the clean hands doctrine, but rather from the particular factual circumstances of the case or from an entirely proper desire on the court's part to use the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> only where it is necessary to achieve justice for the company.

40|$|The {{protection}} of minority shareholders {{has become one}} of the key features of company law reform in many countries in recent years. Various mechanisms have been created to achieve this objective. Australia has introduced the statutory <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> procedure mainly based on models drawn from Canada and New Zealand; this provision was inserted into the Corporations Act in March 2000. China has also adopted a similar mechanism – known as the shareholder representative action; this scheme was based upon China’s understanding of statutory <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> in Western countries. China’s <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> mechanism is reflected in amendments to the 2005 PRC Company Law and 2005 Securities Law that both were passed on 27 October 2005 and came into effective on 1 January 2006. The development of statutory <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> in different countries demonstrates the interaction between forces of convergence and divergence in company law reforms. This article reviews different mechanisms adopted in the Chinese law for the {{protection of}} minority shareholders. It especially focuses on an analysis of the nature of the shareholder representative action and the procedures for its utilisation in China – the equivalent to Western countries’ <b>derivative</b> <b>actions.</b> In comparison with statutory <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> in Australia, this article argues that the concept of the shareholder representative action in China rests upon a misunderstanding of Western derivative actions; this has involved a compromise between the dire need to protect shareholders and the ambiguities of a weak court system. As a consequence, China’s reforms in this area are largely a tentative gesture and are therefore unlikely to be very effective. <br /...|$|R
40|$|In {{corporate}} law, the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> mechanism allows {{minority shareholders}} and, in certain jurisdictions, single directors or even creditors to file and litigate {{on behalf of}} the corporation a lawsuit against an insider or a third party whose action has allegedly injured the corporation. The <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> is a mechanism that corporate law furnishes to tackle agency problems because the corporate insiders who should initiate such claims occasionally become caught in a conflict of interests. Obviously, each jurisdiction decides whether to employ a <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> mechanism and on what terms. However, in a globalized world that offers many attractive places in which investors can incorporate their businesses, corporate law regulation has become increasingly affected by surrounding regulatory environments. In many respects, conflict-of-laws rules manage the interaction between local and foreign regulatory rules. The purpose of this Article is to discuss the regulation of <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> when this mechanism is evoked {{in the context of a}} foreign corporation. This rather common scenario creates a choice-of-law question: should the terms and conditions for filing a <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> on behalf of a foreign corporation (as opposed to the cause-of-action itself) be regulated by the law of the forum or by the law of the place of incorporation? For example, should the forum court enable plaintiffs to rely on the forum 2 ̆ 7 s local <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> mechanism when the foreign law of the place of incorporation rules out completely the possibility of <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> being filed? This Article analyzes the doctrinal contexts that may serve as a legal platform for resolving this question, as well as the relevant considerations to be taken into account. The Article subsequently argues that, in contrast to a prevailing perception, the law of incorporation should not always be applied. It is further argued that the public policy doctrine, rather than any other doctrinal context, is best suited to serve as a platform for adjudicating the choice-of-law question and that forum shopping concerns should be excluded from this question and confined to the context of jurisdiction ascertainment...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesSection 165 of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 {{introduces}} the new statutory <b>derivative</b> <b>action.</b> The section confers a pivotal function {{on the courts}} as gatekeepers to the <b>derivative</b> <b>action,</b> with an important filtering or screening function to weed out applications for <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> that are frivolous, vexatious or without merit. The vital judicial discretion to grant leave to an applicant to bring a <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> entails a tension between two equally important policy objectives. A proper balance between these two underpinning policy objectives depends on the appropriate judicial interpretation and application of the three vague, general and open-textured criteria or gateways for the grant of leave to institute a <b>derivative</b> <b>action.</b> The courts have been entrusted by s 165 to flesh out the details, the contours, the ambit and the scope of these criteria. This crucially gives the courts a dominant and a decisive {{role in shaping the}} effectiveness of the new statutory <b>derivative</b> <b>action.</b> This thesis makes an original contribution to knowledge in three main respects. First, this thesis focuses on the three guiding criteria for leave, and their many nuances, interpretations and applications in certain foreign jurisdictions that have exerted an influence on the provisions of s 165. Based on experience garnered from Australian, Canadian and New Zealand law, as well as the United Kingdom and the USA, guidelines are suggested for the approach that the South African courts should adopt to the three preconditions for a <b>derivative</b> <b>action.</b> Secondly, it is submitted that the real weakness in s 165 lies in the rebuttable presumption in s 165 (7) and (8), which contains a fatal flaw that renders the remedy defective and calls for legislative amendment. Pending such amendment, proposals are suggested for the proper judicial approach in the meantime to the troublesome presumption. These proposals are supported by both reasoned argument and original research on experience in certain foreign jurisdictions, particularly the USA. Thirdly, and equally importantly, a framework is suggested in this thesis for the proper exercise of the judicial discretion to make orders of costs, which is known to have plagued minority shareholders wishing to bring derivative proceedings against miscreant directors who have wronged the company...|$|R
40|$|Using a dataset of Chinese {{judicial}} opinions arising in {{over fifty}} cases, this paper analyses {{the development and}} current implementation of shareholder <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> in the courts of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), {{both before and after}} the derivative lawsuit was explicitly authorized in the PRC’s 2006 Company Law effective January 1, 2006. In addition, we describe the very unique ecology of enterprise organization and corporate governance in modern China, and critique the formal design of the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> and offer reform suggestions. We find the design of the Chinese derivative lawsuit to be, in some respects, innovative and appropriate for Chinese circumstances. For instance, the statutory scheme permits “horizontal” claims against controlling or oppressive shareholders in addition to “vertical” claims against orthodox insiders and fiduciaries. At the same time, we find certain design flaws, including standing-based obstacles for plaintiffs, a lack of clarity regarding demand, demand excuse and refusal, and an unnecessary distinction regarding the required wrong underlying <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> directed at corporate fiduciaries, on one hand, and others (such as controlling shareholders), on the other. In implementation, we find extremely robust – even overly-aggressive – use of the mechanism by both plaintiffs and deciding judges before and after its formal recognition in law. As in other applications of the corporate law before the courts in China, this use of the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> seems to be entirely limited to the closely-held form of corporation. The absence of application with respect to the widely-held, joint stock, form of company is striking because the derivative lawsuit itself was included in the 2006 PRC Company Law revision precisely so as to give minority shareholders in such widely-held companies a way to hold insiders and controlling shareholders accountable at law for rampant malfeasance. In addition, we note the way in which some PRC courts are wary or uncomprehending of the underlying corporate law doctrines for which the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> is a necessary vehicle, particularly the duty of care. A final updated and edited version of this paper will be published as “Pathway to Minority Shareholder Protection: <b>Derivative</b> <b>Actions</b> in the People’s Republic of China” in D. Puchniak et al. (eds.), The <b>Derivative</b> <b>Action</b> in Asia: A Comparative and Functional Approach (Cambridge University Press, forthcoming Spring 2012) ...|$|R
40|$|At {{the heart}} of any {{sophisticated}} system of corporate law lies the proper protection of minority shareholders. A chief safeguard for them is the statutory <b>derivative</b> <b>action.</b> A <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> is brought {{on behalf of a}} company, to redress a wrong done to the company. In other words, the minority shareholder is seeking to protect not his own rights but the company's rights. A <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> may be pursued on behalf of the company by a shareholder, director or prescribed officer of the company, or any other person with standing 1 under the Companies Act 71 of 2008 ('the Act'), but only with the leave of the court. This judicial screening mechanism is essential, because the company itself has chosen not to sue and the institution of a <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> would involve the company in litigation against its corporate will. The requirement of the leave of the court provides a buffer against interference by disgruntled shareholders and other stakeholders in the internal management of the company, and prevents them from improperly arrogating the management function that is vested in the board of directors.

2500|$|In most {{commercial}} control systems, <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> {{is based}} on process variable rather than error. That is, {{a change in the}} setpoint does not affect the <b>derivative</b> <b>action.</b> [...] This is because the digitized version of the algorithm produces a large unwanted spike when the setpoint is changed. If the setpoint is constant then changes in the PV will be the same as changes in error. Therefore, this modification makes no difference to the way the controller responds to process disturbances.|$|R
40|$|In October 2007 a {{statutory}} scheme, {{designed to}} address the issue of <b>derivative</b> <b>actions,</b> came into force. The scheme provided that shareholders wishing to continue (or commence) derivative proceedings in relation to wrongs committed against their company had to obtain the permission/leave of the court. In the subsequent eight years there have been few <b>derivative</b> <b>actions</b> instituted by shareholders and only a small percentage of actions commenced have succeeded in obtaining court permission/leave to proceed. This article undertakes an analytical review of the statutory scheme and identifies reasons why there are so few proceedings in the UK, and more broadly it examines and evaluates the <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> scheme itself. The article considers whether the statutory scheme is too narrow and explores some changes that might be made to it in order to make it more accessible and more effective...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{culmination}} of a research of a particular branch of Corporate Law, which has grown in several major parts of civilized jurisdictions. The thrust {{of the study was}} to evaluate the past, present and the future of a particular type of action known in Corporate Law under the umbrella of shareholder remedies - the 'Derivative Action' with emphasis to develop the law in one jurisdiction profiting from another. The research thus reveals how, when and where the so called action originated, the initial effects these actions had on the corporate world including shareholders, companies and related persons natural or juristic. Though much has been written by way of books, treatises and articles and several researches have dealt with the common topic shareholder remedies in its broad perspect, there is no separate study carried out on this topic in its global context with a comparative focus. This study has therefore given me the drive, initiative and courage to look at the conceptual view or the macro view of the so called 'Derivative Action' with of course special emphasis on the Australian and Sri Lankan jurisdictions in its micro aspects. This, I believe is the first time anyone has undertaken such a task. The study thus travels through distant roads of common law action to the statutory form of the action in the relevant jurisdictions and finds it driving with much purpose in jurisdictions such as Australia and Sri Lanka which are both in the transitional era from the common law action to the statutory action. The research is based on the collection of material namely, case law - Australian, Sri Lankan and international on the matters in issue, Legal treatises on the subject matter local and international, Law reform material - Australian, Sri Lankan and international on the topic, Bills and Statutes available on the topic in Australia, Sri Lanka and other countries. I have met resource personnel with regard to Law Reform in several jurisdictions on the matters in issue and visited the Australian Stock Exchange and the Colombo Stock Exchange. The research findings depend mainly on the electronic data available in addition to resources available at the University of Canberra, the Australian National University, Colombo Law Library, The Colombo Law Society Library and the Sri Lanka Supreme Court Judges' Chambers Library and the Sri Lanka Attorney General's Department Library. Visits to the McGill University in Montreal, Canada and the corporate law sector in New Zealand, including Universities and Law Offices in Christchurch and Auckland too has helped me considerably in the process. Review of the literature of the proposed statutory <b>Derivative</b> <b>Action</b> in Australia and the proposed statutory <b>Derivative</b> <b>Action</b> in Sri Lanka, are based mainly on; Enforcement of the duties of directors and officers of a company by means of a statutory <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> (Report No. 12) Companies and Securities Law Review Committee. (November 1990.), Corporate Practices and the Rights of Shareholders (Report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs) Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. (November 1991.), Report on A Statutory <b>Derivative</b> <b>Action</b> Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. (July 1993.), Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (CLERP) Proposal Paper No 3 (1997), the CLERP draft legislative provisions (1998), Australian case law on the application of the common law <b>Derivative</b> <b>Action,</b> both in the High Court and in individual States and Australian articles on <b>Derivative</b> <b>Action</b> as a common law remedy and on the introduction of the statutory action. In the Sri Lankan context, the proposals in Sri Lanka for the statutory <b>Derivative</b> <b>Action</b> and the case law in Sri Lanka on the application of the common law remedy has been referred to. Other literature include, material available on the Canadian formula of <b>Derivative</b> <b>Action,</b> including Statutes, Rules, case law, articles and other relevant data, material available on the <b>Derivative</b> <b>Actions</b> in the United States, material available in New Zealand on <b>Derivative</b> <b>Actions,</b> material available in England on <b>Derivative</b> <b>Actions,</b> namely on the common law approach, case law, articles, Bills, Rules and other connected material, Statutes on <b>Derivative</b> <b>Actions</b> in other jurisdictions at present and Hong Kong proposals for a statutory <b>Derivative</b> <b>Action,</b> to name some. The aforesaid material and the review of the same have assisted the study as follows: -To place the past, present and the future of the common law <b>Derivative</b> <b>Action.</b> -Examine the objectives of the <b>Derivative</b> <b>Action.</b> -The operation of the common law aspects of the action. -The benefits of the statutory form of the action. -Experiences of other countries in the recent past on the subject. -The Australian reform process presently underway. -The best experiences in Australia with regard to case law. -To evaluate whether the remedy should be limited to fraud on the minority or whether it should be extended further even to negligence. -How best Sri Lanka could benefit from the Australian formula of the statutory form of the action. -To evaluate whether the proposed model of the statutory action in Sri Lanka is adequate in view of the Australian and other accepted formulae on the subject. -Whether the common law action should be expressly abolished in Sri Lanka. -Consider the possible introduction of the best methods to Sri Lanka. Finally, the research speaks for itself the need for a statutory <b>Derivative</b> <b>Action</b> for Sri Lanka in the future, to be an improvement on the Canadian, New Zealand and Australian models. The research findings, especially in its conclusions and recommendation in Chapter 8, will no doubt help to improve the proposed statutory <b>Derivative</b> <b>Action</b> in Sri Lanka in a small way...|$|R
50|$|Oppression {{claims are}} {{separate}} from <b>derivative</b> <b>actions,</b> {{but the two}} are not mutually exclusive. However, a <b>derivative</b> <b>action</b> claim can only be instituted by leave of the court, as it is brought by a complainant to sue {{on behalf of the}} corporation for a wrong done to the corporation, and any successful claim is binding on all shareholders. This is in contrast to the oppression remedy claim, where a complainant sues on behalf of himself for a wrong he suffers personally as a result of corporate conduct.|$|R
