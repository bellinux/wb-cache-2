40|$|BACKGROUND CONTEXT: It is {{estimated}} that up to 80 % {{of the general population}} will experience at least one significant bout of low back pain in their lifetime. The leading known cause of low back pain is degenerative disc disease (DDD). Many established risk factors for low back pain and DDD are mechanical in nature and are often related to occupational activities, such as poor posture and frequent/heavy lifting. Altered mechanical loading in the spine {{has been shown to be}} a potential stimulus for disc degeneration. However, a link between occupational/environmental factors and intervertebral loading has never been demonstrated in vivo. We hypothesize that intervertebral loading is highly dependent on muscle activation and recruitment. These relationships are significant because they provide a potential connection between everyday activities and low back pain.

None of the tested implants managed to achieve a neutral zone decrease compared to intact, suggesting that <b>interbody</b> <b>implants</b> fail to eliminate micromotion at the bone-implant interface.

Lucencies have been reported around bone dowel implants in the postoperative period, which {{have been shown to}} resolve. The diagnosis of fusion through metallic implants has been difficult with both false-positive and false-negative results. The literature of imaging these implants is very sparse. Methods. Four interbody constructs were placed in cadaveric spines under different conditions and imaged using both computed tomography and plain film radiography. Results. Plain radiographs could not predict the presence of intraimplant bone whereas computed tomography was accurate. Metallic implants had a 1 – 3 -mm computed tomography artifact limiting peri-implant interpretation. Lucencies could be seen on computed tomography but not on plain radiographs. However, the opposite was also seen. Lucencies around nonmetallic implants were more visible by a 4 : 1 ratio. Conclusions. Potential errors in interpretation were identified including assessment for bridging bone, assessment for lucency, and obscuration of peri-implant detail from metallic artifact. Lucencies were more visible with nonmetallic implants than with metallic constructs. Plain radiograph analysis of metallic implants tended to underestimate lucencies, whereas analysis of nonmetallic implants tended to overestimate lucencies.

40|$|Segmental {{instability}} in degenerative disc disease is often treated with anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF). Current techniques require an additional posterior approach to achieve sufficient stability by inserting pedicle or translaminar screws. The test device, the “SynFix-LRTM” {{is a novel}} implant which consists of a PEEK-body and an integrated anterior titanium plate hosting four diverging locking screws. The test device avoids posterior fixation by enhancing stability via the locking screws. 4 / 57 The test device was compared to an already established stand-alone <b>interbody</b> <b>implant,</b> called “STALIF” in a human cadaveric three dimensional stiffness test. In the biomechanical test, the L 4 / 5 motion segment of 16 human cadaveric lumbar spines were isolated and divided into two test groups.

Each specimen was tested in native state first, then a discectomy was performed and either of the test implants was applied. The biomechanical testing revealed a greater stiffness in lateral bending for the SynFix-LRTM compared to the established implant.

However, similar trends in outcomes can be identified [[25]] and [[26]] used a human cadaver model to compare lumbar spine kinematics of a laterally placed interbody device used as a stand-alone construct with various instrumented constructs (Table  3). They tested 5 conditions: (1) intact spine, (2) lateral discectomy and stand-alone lateral interbody device (XLIF), (3) XLIF supplemented by a lateral plate, (4) XLIF supplemented by unilateral pedicle screws, and (5) XLIF supplemented by bilateral pedicle screws. Results revealed that the extreme lateral <b>interbody</b> <b>implant,</b> with or without supplemental fixation, provides primary stabilization in all loading modes compared with intact specimens. The greatest reduction in ROM was observed with lateral bending and flexion-extension in all treatments. Le Huec et al. [[28]] compared the biomechanics of lateral interbody cage in 8 cadaveric lumbar functional spinal units with 2 additional modes of fixation: a lateral plate and a lateral plate locked to the cage. The laterally placed cage produced a decrease in the ROM compared with intact in flexion extension and lateral bending, but not in axial rotation. The reduction in ROM observed with the plate was significantly reduced relative to the intact spine in all 3 motion planes. Kim et al. [[27]] evaluated the stability of human cadaveric lumbar spine constructs with interbody reconstruction performed via a traditional ALIF approach or a lateral approach. Specimens were evaluated in 4 conditions: (1) intact spine, (2) destabilization by anterior or lateral discectomy, (3) stand-alone interbody reconstruction and (4) interbody reconstruction supplemented with additional fixation. The stand-alone lateral interbody and ALIF implants restored the ROM and NZ to intact spine values.

Previously published experimental material properties {{are used as}} inputs to the numerical simulation. Background: Interbody spinal fusion procedures using cage style inter-vertebral implants often cause subsidence failure of the vertebral end plate, resulting in potential pain and mechanical instability of the fusion system. Methods: Finite element models were developed to simulate compressive load transfer between <b>interbody</b> <b>implants</b> and adjacent vertebral body. The vertebral body was modelled using tied finite element mesh regions for cancellous core and cortical shell, and non-linear frictional contact between implants and vertebral end plate. Results: Simulation results predicted end plate stresses of approximately twelve times the nominal contact pressure due to differing deformation stiffnesses of the implant and end plate structures. Reduction of the cancellous core elastic modulus to simulate severely osteoporotic bone resulted in end plate stresses up to three {{times higher than the}} benchmark values. Conclusions: In this study, finite element analysis was used to investigate the stresses in interbody fusion systems. Published vertebral loads corresponding to certain activities were shown to generate end-plate stresses which approach and exceed the failure stress for cortical bone. Endplate stresses are strongly dependent on the modulus of the underlying cancellous core. Relevance. Endplate subsidence failure can potentially occur at the corners of existing cage-type <b>interbody</b> <b>implants</b> under physiological compressive loads. Matching material properties between cortical endplate and implant does not guarantee optimal contact conditions, and overall bending stiffness should be assessed...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Biomechanics play an {{important}} role in spine fusion, but the in vivo biomechanics of the cervical spine are not well characterized and the in vivo biomechanics after spinal arthrodesis have never been studied. Load sharing facilitates fusion, but overloading of <b>interbody</b> <b>implants</b> can lead to subsidence and failure. In vitro studies have demonstrated that anterior plating significantly alters mechanical loading in the cervical spine.

30|$|Loosening {{is defined}} radiographically as a lucent rim of 2  mm or greater {{surrounding}} the hardware, particularly when this lucency enlarges on sequential studies. It is best visualised on CT or plain radiographs. Loosening of vertebral body screws in older anterior constructs without locking screw plates {{may result in}} the backing out of the screw. Nuclear medicine bone scintigraphy demonstrates increased radiotracer uptake at sites of motion. Functional fusion, defined as less than 3 ° of motion between flexion and extension views performed 8 – 16  weeks postoperatively, depends on patient cooperation and can be underestimated by muscle guarding/spasm. Osseous fusion is demonstrated radiographically by bridging trabecular bone. Premineralised osteoid resulting in functional fusion is radiolucent, with radiographically evident fusion not evident until 6 – 9  months postoperatively [40]. Centrally interrupted trabeculation can suggest motion, delayed union, and/or early pseudoarthrosis. Radionuclide scintigraphy may suggest pseudoarthrosis or loosening with tracer uptake seen beyond a year postoperatively. <b>Interbody</b> <b>implants</b> appear to float in the early postoperative period, as morselised autographs are not visible on plain radiographs and do not indicate loosening.|$|R
40|$|Study Design. A finite-element {{model was}} created to study parametrically the load {{transfer}} characteristics of a lower lumbar motion segment implanted with dual anteroposterior cylindrical interbody cages. Objectives. To describe the frontal plane bone–implant interface stresses acting on a generic cylindrical interbody cage, to evaluate the effect of implant material properties on these stresses, and to determine the associated load transfer mechanisms. Summary of Background Data. From a biomechanical perspective, the long-term success of an interbody cage fusion depends on effective load transfer. The cage must stress the graft sufficiently to promote fusion, while keeping bone–implant interface stresses in a range that will prevent implant subsidence or loosening. At this writing, no published study has described interface stresses or load transfer mechanisms for these devices. Methods. A planar finite-element model was used to simulate uniform compression loading of the implanted segment. Material properties of the interbody cage were varied to simulate cortical bone, titanium, and stainless steel implants. Normal and shear interface stresses were output {{along the length of}} the interface. Results. Magnitudes of both the normal and shear interface stresses were substantially higher at the medial and lateral sides of the interface than in the center. Interface stresses were largely independent of implant material. Conclusions. Cylindrical <b>interbody</b> <b>implants</b> have inherent limitations, including stress concentrations at the bone–implant interface and possible stress shielding of the graft.

40|$|Abstract Background Most modern spinal {{implants}} contain titanium {{and remain}} in the patient’s body permanently. Local and systemic effects such as tissue necrosis, osteolysis and malignant cell transformation caused by implants have been described. Increasing tissue concentration and whole blood levels of ions are necessary before a disease caused by a contaminant develops. The aim {{of the present study}} was the measurement of whole blood titanium levels and the evaluation of a possible correlation between these changes and the number of fused segments. Methods A prospective study was designed to determine changes in whole blood titanium levels after spinal fusion and to analyze the correlation to the number of pedicle screws, cross connectors and <b>interbody</b> devices <b>implanted.</b> Blood samples were taken preoperatively in group I (n[*]=[*] 15), on the first, second and 10 th day postoperatively, as well as 3 and 12 [*]months after surgery. Group II (n[*]=[*] 16) served as a control group of volunteers who did not have any metal implants in the body. Blood samples were taken once in this group. The number of screw-rod-connections and the length of the spinal fusion were determined using radiographic pictures. This study was checked and approved by the ethical committee of the University of Tuebingen. Results The mean age in group I was 47 [*]±[*] 22 [*]years (range 16 - 85 [*]years). There were three male (20 %) and twelve female (80 %) patients. The median number of fused segments was 5 (range 1 to 11 segments). No statistically significant increase in the titanium level was seen 12 [*]months after surgery (mean difference: - 7. 2 [*]μg/l, 95 % CI: - 26. 9 to 12. 5 [*]μg/l, p[*]=[*] 0. 446). By observing the individual titanium levels, 4 out of 15 patients demonstrated an increase in titanium levels 12 [*]months after surgery. No statistically significant correlation between fused segments (r[*]=[*]- 0. 188, p[*]=[*] 0. 503) length of instrumentation (r[*]=[*]- 0. 329, p[*]=[*] 0. 231), number of interbody devices (r[*]=[*]- 0. 202, p[*]=[*] 0. 291) and increase of titanium levels over the observation period was seen. Conclusions Instrumented spinal fusion does not lead to a statistically significant increase in whole blood titanium levels. There seems to be no correlation between the number of pedicle screws, cross connectors and <b>interbody</b> devices <b>implanted</b> and the increase of serum titanium levels. </p...|$|R
40|$|Fusion of {{cervical}} spine in kyphotic alignment {{has been}} proven to produce an acceleration of degenerative changes at adjacent levels. Stand-alone cages are reported to have a relatively high incidence of implant subsidence with secondary kyphotic deformity. This malalignment may theoretically lead to adjacent segment disease in the long term. The prospective study analysed possible risk factors leading to cage subsidence with resulting sagittal malalignment of cervical spine. Radiographic data of 100 consecutive patients with compressive radiculo-/myelopathy due to degenerative disc prolapse or osteophyte formation were prospectively collected in those who were treated by anterior cervical discectomy and implantation of single type interbody fusion cage. One hundred and forty four implants were inserted altogether at one or two levels as stand-alone cervical spacers without any bone graft or graft substitute. All patients underwent standard anterior cervical discectomy and the <b>interbody</b> <b>implants</b> were placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Plain radiographs were obtained on postoperative days one and three to verify position of the implant. Clinical and radiographic follow-up data were obtained at 6  weeks, 3 and 6  months and than annually in outpatient clinic. Radiographs were evaluated with respect to existing subsidence of implants. Subsidence was defined as more than 2  mm reduction in segmental height due to implant migration into the adjacent end-plates. Groups of subsided and non-subsided implants were statistically compared with respect to spacer distance to the anterior rim of vertebral body, spacer versus end-plate surface ratio, amount of bone removed from adjacent vertebral bodies during decompression and pre- versus immediate postoperative intervertebral space height ratio. There were 18 (18 %) patients with 19 (13. 2 %) subsided cages in total. No patients experienced any symptoms. At 2  years, there was no radiographic evidence of accelerated adjacent segment degeneration. All cases of subsidence occurred at the anterior portion of the implant: 17 cases into the inferior vertebra, 1 into the superior and 1 into both vertebral bodies. In most cases, the process of implant settling started during the perioperative period and its progression did not exceed three postoperative months. There was an 8. 7 ° average loss of segmental lordosis (measured by Cobb angle). Average distance of subsided intervertebral implants from anterior vertebral rim {{was found to be}} 2. 59  mm, while that of non-subsided was only 0. 82  mm (P <  0. 001). Spacer versus end-plate surface ratio was significantly smaller in subsided implants (P <  0. 001). Ratio of pre- and immediate postoperative height of the intervertebral space did not show significant {{difference between the two groups}} (i. e. subsided cages were not in overdistracted segments). Similarly, comparison of pre- and postoperative amount of bone mass in both adjacent vertebral bodies did not show a significant difference. Appropriate implant selection and placement appear to be the key factors influencing cage subsidence and secondary kyphotisation of box-shaped, stand-alone cages in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. Mechanical support of the implant by cortical bone of the anterior osteophyte and maximal cage to end-plate surface ratio seem to be crucial in the prevention of postoperative loss of lordosis. Our results were not able to reflect the importance of end-plate integrity maintenance; the authors would, however, caution against mechanical end-plate damage. Intraoperative overdistraction was not shown to be a significant risk factor in this study. The significance of implant subsidence in acceleration of degenerative changes in adjacent segments remains to be evaluated during a longer follow-up...|$|R
30|$|Anterior {{cervical}} discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is {{a standard}} procedure performed in patients with degenerative disc disease, disc prolapse and spinal canal stenosis. The anterior approach to the cervical spine to perform an arthrodesis was simultaneously published by Bailey and Badgley, Cloward, and Smith and Robinson (Bailey and Badgley 1960, Cloward 1958, Smith and Robinson 1958). The authors used bone dowels in cylindric- or box-shaped design, either harvested from the patient’s iliac crest or taken from human donors as allogenic material. The clinical success rate reported in literature is very high and the radiologic signs of complete bony fusion are reported {{to come up to}} 98 % (Savolainen et al. 1994). There are some disadvantages of taking the bone from the iliac crest as possible complications such as infection, hematoma, fractures, and prolonged donor site pain in up to 49 % of operated patients (Banwart et al. 1995). Due to the long experience with this surgical technique, this procedure is considered to be the gold standard with which all alternative therapeutic options have to be compared in regard to the clinical and radiological outcome with special interest to the fusion rate {{as well as to the}} complication rate. About 20 years ago, Kaden et al. reported the use of a titanium <b>implant</b> as an <b>interbody</b> fusion device for the cervical spine, a so-called “cage” (Kaden et al. 1993). Although the initial results are favourable, long-term effects of metallic cage devices on cervical spine motion segments are still unknown (Hacker et al. 2000, Matge 1998). Some shortcomings of metallic <b>interbody</b> <b>implants,</b> like cage migration, subsidence, adjacent level degeneration, stenotic myelopathy, and non-union have already been reported (Cabraja et al. 2012, Chen et al. 2013, Daentzer et al. 2005, Hacker et al. 2000, Majd et al. 1999, Matge 1998, Wilke et al. 2002). One further relevant disadvantage of these metallic implants is the fact, that they lead to artifacts during computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), complicating early detection of a metastatic recurrence and the evaluation of interbody fusion (Schulte et al. 2000). Because of their high axial compression stiffness, metallic cages may lead to stress shielding of the cancellous bone grafts inside the cage, resulting in a decreased interbody bone matrix formation or non-union (Epari et al. 2005, Kandziora et al. 2001 a, 2002, Kanayama et al. 2000, van Dijk et al. 2002 b). At the same time, experience with carbon fiber cages as cervical spinal interbody fusion devices had been reported (Brooke et al. 1997, Shono et al. 1993). The elasticity modulus of the carbon fiber material comes near to that of cortical bone which leads to a physiologic distribution of the forces to the adjacent endplates (Shono et al. 1993). However, subsidence is an imminent risk even during the application of carbon fiber cages (Wilke et al. 2002). Because of the radiolucent properties, carbon fiber devices do not cause any artifacts during CT or MRI. But a potential risk is the wear debris of the carbon fibers which can lead to inflammatory and foreign body reactions (Parsons et al. 1985). Since the beginning of this millennium, implants of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) have been used more frequently (Cho et al. 2002). Analogous to carbon fiber material, postoperative CT and MRI can be performed without having interfering artifacts and the evaluation of fusion is not problematic. Furthermore, the elasticity modulus of PEEK is more similar to bone than that of titanium and carbon fiber material with less risk of subsidence into the vertebral endplates. Nevertheless, subsidence in cages which consist of PEEK with consecutive segmental kyphosis had been observed in several clinical studies (Cabraja et al. 2012, Chen et al. 2013, Kast et al. 2009, Lemcke et al. 2011).|$|R

Sixty-two patients with cervical radiculopathy and/or myelopathy due to soft disc herniation or spondylosis were treated with one- or two-level discectomy and fusion with interbody cages containing β-TCP. They were randomly assigned to receive supplemented anterior plate (n =  33) or not (n =  29). The patients were followed up for 2  years postoperatively. The radiological and clinical outcomes were assessed during a 2 -year follow-up. The results showed that the fusion rate (75. 0 %) 3  months after surgery in patients treated without anterior cervical plating was significantly lower than that (97. 9 %) with plate fixation (P    0. 05) was found regarding improvement in spinal curvature as well as neck and arm pain, and recovery rate of JOA score at all time intervals between the two groups. Based on the findings of this study, interbody fusion cage containing β-TCP following one- or two-level discectomy proved to be an effective treatment for cervical spondylotic radiculopathy and/or myelopathy. Supplemented anterior plate fixation can promote interbody fusion and prevent cage subsidence but do not improve the 2 -year outcome when compared with those treated without anterior plate fixation...|$|R
40|$|Posterior lumbar <b>interbody</b> fusion (PLIF) <b>implants</b> are {{increasingly}} being used for 360 ° fusion after decompression of lumbar spinal stenosis combined with degenerative instability. Both titanium and PEEK (PolyEtherEtherKetone) implants are com-monly used. Assessing the clinical and radiological results as well as typical complications, such as migration of the cages, is important. In addition, questions such as which radiological parameters {{can be used to}} assess successful fusion, and whether the exclusive use of local bone graft is sufficient, are fre-quently debated. We prospectively evaluated 30 patients after PLIF instrumentation for degenerative lumbar spinal canal stenosis, over a course of 42 months. In all cases, tita-nium cages and local bone graft were used for spondylodesis. The follow-up protocol of these 30 cases included standardised clinical and radiologi-cal evaluation at 3, 6, 12 and 42 months after surgery. Overall satisfactory results were achieved. With one exception, a stable result was achieved with restora-tion of the intervertebral space in the anterior col-umn. After 42 months of follow-up in most cases, a radiologically visible loss of disc space height can be demonstrated. Clinically relevant migration of the cage in the dorsal direction was detected in one case. Based on our experience, posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) can be recommended for the treatment of monosegmental and bisegmental spinal stenosis, with or without segmental instability. Postoperative evaluation is mainly based on clinical parameters since the titanium implant affects the diagnostic value of imaging studies and is responsible for arte-facts.

Cages offer the benefits of bone graft containment, restored intervertebral and foraminal height, and a more repeatable, stable procedure compared to interbody fusion with graft material alone. Due to concerns regarding postoperative stability, loss of lordosis, and subsidence or migration of the <b>implant,</b> <b>interbody</b> cages are commonly used with supplemental fixation such as pedicle screw systems or anterior plates. While providing additional stability, supplemental fixation techniques increase operative time, exposure, cost, and morbidity. The VariLift® Interbody Fusion System (VariLift® system) has been developed as a standalone solution to provide the benefits of intervertebral fusion cages without the requirement of supplemental fixation. The VariLift® system, FDA-cleared for standalone use in both the cervical and lumbar spine, is implanted in a minimal profile and then expanded in situ to provide segmental stability, restored lordosis, and a large graft chamber. Preclinical testing and analyses {{have found that the}} VariLift® System is durable, and reduces stresses that may contribute to subsidence and migration of other standalone interbody cages. Fifteen years of clinical development with the VariLift® system have demonstrated positive clinical outcomes, continued patient maintenance of segmental stability and lordosis, and no evidence of implant migration. The purpose of this report is to describe the VariLift® system, including implant characteristics, principles of operation, indications for use, patient selection criteria, surgical technique, postoperative care, preclinical testing, and clinical experience. The VariLift® System represents an improved surgical option for a stable interbody fusion without requiring supplemental fixation. Keywords: TLIF, PLIF, ACDF, standalone cag...|$|R
40|$|To date {{autologous}} tricortical {{iliac crest}} bone graft {{is considered the}} golden standard in cervical spine interbody fusion. However, the morbidity associated with the harvesting of iliac crest bone {{has led to the}} development of alternative allogenic implants during the last decade. These allogenic implants, in turn, have inherent disadvantages in terms of biocompatibity, foreign body reaction and inflammatory response. Apart from these biological problems these allogenic implants are known to cause artefacts in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging, complicating both, early detection of tumor recurrence and evaluation of interbody fusion. Bioabsorbable cages do not interfere with postoperative radiographic, CT or magnetic resonance imaging and do not induce reflections or artefacts. Due to their biodegradability they are no long term implants. The present study describes and quantifies the histological integration of a bioresorbable cage in a sheep model of cervical spine interbody fusion. In 40 sheep which underwent discectomy and implantation of a Resorbon®-Cage in segment C 3 / 4 histological, histomorphometrical and biocompatibility studies have been performed. Animals were assigned to five groups (n= 8) [...] For histological and histomorphometric evaluation Groups I and II were sacrificed at three months. However, in group II implants were coated with growth factors. Animals of group III, IV and V were killed at twelve and twenty-four months, respectively. In the early phase of <b>interbody</b> fusion the <b>implant</b> showed a decreased level of inflammation and foreign body reaction. During that time Resorbon® induced only slight inflammation and no osteolytic destruction, indicative of good biocompartibility and relatively high primary stability.

Consequently and in consideration of the results of this study it needs to be clearly stressed out that biocompatibility of the implant has to be enhanced and improved. Based on these long-term results, Resorbon® as evaluated in this study for sheep cervical spine interbody fusion can not simply be recommended for clinical use and human circumstances...|$|R
40|$|In the United States {{approximately}} 50 {{million people}} suffer from low back pain. In the 20 - 50 years age group, {{this is the}} most important and expensive health care problem. The causes of low back pain are various. A herniated disk or spinal stenosis may trap nerve roots exiting the spinal column. Spondylolisthesis or degenerative disorders affecting the facet joints may cause some spinal units to become unstable. Although the majority of patients suffering back pain respond well to conservative treatments such as medication and physical therapy, a fraction of them will require spinal surgery. Different methods of stabilization exist, such as posterior, posterolateral and interbody fusion. Titanium screws and rods can be used for a posterior or posterolateral stabilization, with or without bone graft. Metallic cages or screws can also be used for a posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) or an anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF), with or without bone graft inside the implant. A common drawback and risks to all of these implants is that they are made out of metal, with all the potential problems engendered by these materials. The present dissertation work aims at designing an improved anterior lumbar <b>interbody</b> fusion (ALIF) <b>implant</b> for the L 5 -S 1 segment. The global objective of this thesis is to develop an alternative biomaterial that can replace at the same time the metallic cage and the bone graft. It must be biocompatible, bioresorbable, osteoinductive and strong enough to resist the high local stresses. The implant made of this biomaterial should also present an appropriate macroporosity to allow the blood vessels and bone cells to colonize quickly the implant. The implant should then be degraded in a controlled fashion by fragmenting over a defined period of time and releasing non-toxic ions which can be metabolized or excreted by the body. If this could be achieved, then no more graft would be necessary and the synthetic material would disappear with time allowing a complete bone fusion. In order to find an answer to this problem, five studies were defined: An anthropometric study of L 5 -S 1 and the available space for insertion of an implant (Chapter 2). A complete mechanical characterization of two different phosphocalcic cements (Chapter 3). A new method to manufacture hydroxyapatite scaffolds with controlled porosity (Chapter 4). A comparison between an unconstrained and a partially constrained system for in vitro biomechanical testing of the L 5 -S 1 functional spinal unit (Chapter 5). A numerical study using a finite element model of the L 5 -S 1 functional spinal unit, validated with experimental data (Chapter 6). Our study provides the necessary geometrical parameters for the design of an ALIF cage to treat patients with low back pain (Chapter 2). Compression, tension and torsion tests together with the use of a conewise linear elasticity model and a Tsai-Wu failure criterion provide an exhaustive characterization of both elastic and failure properties of a brushite and a hydroxyapatite cement (Chapter 3). A new method to manufacture hydroxyapatite scaffolds with controlled porosity and predictable elastic properties is developed. Since precipitated hydroxyapatite cements are biocompatible, biodegradable and osteoconductive, the manufactured scaffold represents a biomaterial of choice for bone reconstruction in weight bearing areas dominated by compressive stresses (Chapter 4). According to our findings, particular care should be given when quantifying and comparing the kinematics and the flexibility curves of the intact or instrumented spine with experimental set-ups of various degrees of constraints for axial rotation and to an even larger extent for lateral bending (Chapter 5). A three-dimensional finite element model of the L 5 -S 1 FSU is presented. The kinematics of the segment is found to be similar between numerical and experimental results for all major motions (Chapter 6). Following the application of the numerical model to the developed ALIF implant with or without posterior stabilisation, two applications for lumbar fusion are envisaged (Chapter 7). First, this macroporous scaffold can be used as an ALIF implant in conjunction with a posterior stabilization. Main advantages compared to current solutions are that no more bone graft is necessary and that no more metal is inserted anteriorly. Second, this macroporous scaffold can be used as a bone graft material, which can be inserted in a metallic cage of sufficient elasticity...|$|R
