40|$|The tumor {{suppressor}} p 53 homologues, TA-p 73, and p 63 {{have been}} shown to <b>function</b> <b>as</b> tumor suppressors. However, how they <b>function</b> <b>as</b> tumor suppressors remains elusive. Expression of p 63 is controlled by two distinct promoters. Consequently, this results in two different gene products such as TA-(transactivation domain containing NH 2 terminus) p 63 and &#x 2206;N-(lacks NH 2 terminus) p 63. It is generally thought that the TA-p 63 <b>functions</b> <b>as</b> a tumor suppressor, while the &#x 2206;N-p 73 <b>functions</b> <b>as</b> a proto-oncogene. However, careful interpretation of the data concerning &#x 2206;N-p 63 suggests that it could <b>function</b> <b>as</b> an invasion and metastasis/tumor suppressor in a cell context dependent manner...|$|R

40|$|Social stimuli that <b>function</b> <b>as</b> {{reinforcers}} {{for most}} children {{generally do not}} <b>function</b> <b>as</b> reinforcers for children diagnosed with autism. These important social stimuli include smiles, head nods, thumb-ups, and okay signs. It should be an important goal of therapy for children with autism to condition these neutral social stimuli to <b>function</b> <b>as</b> reinforcers for children diagnosed with autism. There is empirical evidence to support both a pairing procedure (classical conditioning) and a discriminative stimulus procedure to condition neutral stimuli to <b>function</b> <b>as</b> reinforcers. However, {{there is no clear}} evidence as to the superiority of effectiveness for either procedure. Despite this most textbooks and curriculum guides for children with autism state only the pairing procedure to condition neutral stimuli to <b>function</b> <b>as</b> reinforcers. Recent studies suggest that the discriminative stimulus procedure may in fact be more effective in conditioning neutral stimuli to <b>function</b> <b>as</b> reinforcers for children diagnosed with autism. The present research is a further comparison of these two procedures. Results from one participant support recent findings that suggest the discriminative stimulus procedure is more effective in conditioning neutral stimuli to <b>function</b> <b>as</b> reinforcers. But the results from the other participant show no effects from either procedure, suggesting future research into conditions necessary to condition neutral social stimuli to <b>function</b> <b>as</b> reinforcers for children with autism...|$|R
