His representatives said that [...] " [...] violated Federal and State trademark laws by making unauthorized use of Mr. Francis' trademark Girls Gone Wild in not only the title, but subject line of her various advertisements in order to lure potential consumers to purchase her latest musical effort." [...] The National Football League (NFL) revealed in their magazine that the song would not be performed at the Super Bowl. On hearing about the allegations, Moxey commented that Francis only wanted attention from the press, adding: [...] "When I looked at ASCAP, I noticed there were approximately 50 records called 'Girls Gone Wild'.

500|$|Connor returns {{near the}} end of the season as a feral teenage warrior who is vindictive towards Angel. Connor's age at his return is disputed: both the creators and episodes vary between putting him at 16 and 18. Regarding Connor's upbringing, Mere Smith elaborates that [...] "Holtz has brought up Connor to hate his father, his father is the devil as far as Holtz is {{concerned}} and he tells Connor that" [...] This development allowed the writers to explore a unique 'foil' to protagonists because Connor was established to be [...] "deep down" [...] much like Angel himself. Minear goes on to explain with Smith that immediately following Connor's return from hell, Angel had started [...] "converting the boy to his side," [...] showing him that he's no longer a bad <b>guy.</b> <b>Just</b> when Connor is bonding with Angel, Holtz kills himself upon sensing the danger of their reconciliation. This makes Connor back track and sets off a back and forth pattern that continues to repeat till the end of season four with Cordelia and then Jasmine taking Holtz' position between father and son.|$|E
500|$|Valo {{has been}} a regular alcohol user much of his life. He got drunk {{for the first time}} at age 13, and on more than one occasion, Valo has also been {{reported}} to have performed intoxicated. In 2000, Valo nearly fell off the balcony of a hotel while under the influence, but was stopped by friends. During a 2005 US tour, Valo's drink was spiked in Minneapolis. He suffered minor injuries and was robbed of his jacket, asthma medicine, cigarettes, credit cards and cell phone. In February 2006, Valo was reportedly arrested at his home in Finland after allegedly threatening to kill his neighbor and resisting arrest. Valo later elaborated on the incident stating that [...] "It was a <b>guy</b> <b>just</b> talking a lot of bull about me and my fiancée [...] And I got pissed off, I went to his door [...] I kicked the door, he opened the door and I told him that if he was ever gonna talk badly about me and my girl, he was gonna end up being dead, and I punched him in the face, and that's the whole thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Liston {{failed to}} answer the bell for the seventh round, and Ali was {{declared}} the winner by technical knockout. At that point the fight was level on the official scorecards. It {{was the first time}} since 1919—when Jack Dempsey defeated Jess Willard—that a world heavyweight champion had quit on his stool. Liston said he quit because of a shoulder injury. Dr. Alexander Robbins, chief physician for the Miami Beach Boxing Commission, diagnosed Liston with a torn tendon in his left shoulder. However, David Remnick, for his book, King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero, spoke with one of Liston's cornermen, who told him that Liston could have continued: [...] " [...] was all BS. We had a return bout clause with Clay, but if you say your <b>guy</b> <b>just</b> quit, who is gonna get a return bout. We cooked up that shoulder thing on the spot." [...] Hall of Fame matchmaker Teddy Brenner also disputed the shoulder injury, claiming he saw Liston use the same arm to throw a chair in his dressing room after the match. However there is ample evidence that Liston carried an injury to his left shoulder into the fight.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2013 {{he again}} {{suggested}} that African Americans possess a [...] "slick" [...] style of boxing which {{is superior to}} other styles (presumably practiced by non-African Americans). [...] "The great Sugar Ray Leonard, right now, if he was boxing, {{the way that they}} want you to fight, the people that pull the strings of the puppet, he would be boring today. Ray Robinson – the great Robinson – would be boring today…Because the feeders of the people that buy entertainment. They're being fed that if they duck, don't buy it.

2500|$|In 2005, Deol {{starred in}} Vikram Bhatt's thriller Jurm as the wealthy {{businessman}} Avinash Malhotra who suspects his wife Sanjana (Lara Dutt) {{of having an}} affair with Rohit (Milind Soman). Deol's performance was praised by a number of critics, with Vivek Fernandes of Rediff.com remarking, [...] "Bobby Deol, Bhatt's schoolmate, does his alma mater proud with his controlled performance. There's a sense of maturity about his candour, which is good news." [...] Deol then starred alongside Sanjay Dutt, Sunil Shetty and Ajay Devgan in Mani Shankar's war movie Tango Charlie as an Indian trooper named Tarun Chauhan of the 101st BSF Battalion, operating in the northeastern Indian province fighting Bodo militants in Upper Assam. He followed this role by featuring in Suneel Darshan's romance film Barsaat as the ambitious young Indian Arav, who, in living in the United States, becomes involved in a love triangle with beauties Priyanka Chopra and Bipasha Basu. The film was not a critical success, with Ziya us Salaam of The Hindu concluding, [...] "A moth-eaten love triangle with all the stereotypes Bollywood survives on – a devoted wife with her karva chauth ki thali, the other woman with her mini-skirts, a joint family, songs, festivities..... No shower of rejuvenation, this [...] "Barsaat" [...] is just drenched in mediocrity." [...] She was equally unimpressed with Deol's performance, remarking, [...] "The girls are ready with their curls and curves, the <b>guy</b> <b>just</b> appears lost, making you wonder if Bobby has grown even an inch as an actor since he made his debut in Rajkumar Santoshi's film by the same name." [...] His final role of 2005 was as Karan in , opposite Akshay Kumar, Lara Dutta, Kareena Kapoor, and Juhi Chawla. He once again plays a wealthy businessman but is down on his luck with his finances and romancing women. The film, although performing below average in India was a major success in the United Kingdom, where it became the highest grosser of Bollywood in 2005, grossing around £888,000.|$|E

60|$|To <b>Guy,</b> <b>just</b> {{fresh from}} England and the {{monotonous}} sea, {{there was a}} certain exhilaration in this first hasty glimpse of the infinite luxuriance of sub-tropical nature. At times he almost forgot Montague Nevitt and the forgery in the boundless sense of freedom and novelty given him by those vast wastes of rolling tableland, thickly covered with grass or low thorny acacias, and stretching illimitably away in low range after range to the blue mountains in the distance. It was strange indeed to him on the wide plains through which they scurried in wild haste to see the springbok rush away from the doubtful track at the first whirr of their wheels, or the bolder bustard stand and gaze among the long grass, with his wary eye turned sideways to look at them. Guy felt for the moment he had left Europe and its reminiscences now fairly behind him; in this free new world, he was free once more himself; his shame was cast aside; he could revel like the antelopes in the immensity of a land where nobody knew him and he knew nobody.|$|E

These gatherings in the diseased joint were always excessively painful, and were very long in coming to the worst, as well as afterwards in healing; and through the week of Philip's stay at Hollywell, Charles was either {{in a state of}} great suffering, or else heavy and confused with opiates. His mother's whole time and thoughts were absorbed in him; she attended to him day and night, and could hardly spare a moment for anything else. Indeed, with all her affection and anxiety for the young lovers, Charles was so entirely her engrossing object, that her first feeling of disappointment at the failure of Philip's journey of investigation was because it would grieve Charlie. She could not think about <b>Guy</b> <b>just</b> then, and for Amy there was nothing for it but patience; and, good little creature, it was very nice to see her put her own troubles aside, and be so cheerful a nurse to her brother. She was almost always in his room, for he liked to have her there, and she could not conquer a certain shrinking from Philip.|$|E
