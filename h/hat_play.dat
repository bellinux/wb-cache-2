40|$|AbstractHistone acetyltransferases (<b>HAT)</b> <b>play</b> a {{critical}} role in transcriptional control by relieving repressive effects of chromatin, and yet how HATs themselves are regulated remains largely unknown. Here, it is shown that Twist directly binds two independent HAT domains of acetyltransferases, p 300 and p 300 /CBP–associated factor (PCAF), and directly regulates their HAT activities. The N terminus of Twist is a primary domain interacting with both acetyltransferases, and the same domain is required for inhibition of p 300 -dependent transcription by Twist. Adenovirus E 1 A protein mimics the effects of Twist by inhibiting the HAT activities of p 300 and PCAF. These findings establish a cogent argument for considering the HAT domains as a direct target for acetyltransferase regulation by both a cellular transcription factor and a viral oncoprotein...|$|E

As variable pH levels {{have a significant}} impact on the physiology of crustaceans, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms by which an animal maintains its internal pH. We examined expression patterns of cytoplasmic (CAc) and membrane-associated form (CAg) of CA, NKA α subunit and HAT subunit a in gills of freshwater crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus, at three pH levels – 6. 2, 7. 2 (control) and 8. 2 – over 24 [*]h. Expression levels of CAc were significantly increased at low pH and decreased at high pH conditions 24 [*]h after transfer. Expression increased at low pH after 12 [*]h, and reached its maximum level by 24 [*]h. CAg showed a significant increase in expression at 6 [*]h after transfer at low pH. Expression of NKA significantly increased at 6 [*]h after transfer to pH 6. 2 and remained elevated for up to 24 [*]h. Expression for HAT and NKA showed similar patterns, where expression significantly increased 6 [*]h after transfer to low pH and remained significantly elevated throughout the experiment. Overall, CAc, CAg, NKA and HAT gene expression is induced at low pH conditions in freshwater crayfish...|$|E

40|$|Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are a {{group of}} enzymes that acetylate lysine {{residues}} in histones, which are bound to DNA in all eukaryotes to form a complex and well organized structure called chromatin. <b>HATs</b> <b>play</b> {{an important role in}} regulating the chromatin organization and accessibility of the DNA to the transcriptional machinery by altering the acetylation status of histones in particular gene loci by chromatin remodeling. Histone acetylation marks active gene transcription while lack of acetylation marks gene repression. The –acetyl moieties are removed from the histones by Histone deacetylases (HDACs). Thus <b>HATs</b> and HDACs <b>play</b> a dynamic role in switching a gene ON and OFF. Dysfunction and deregulation of these enzymes leads to aberrant expression of genes thereby affecting the cellular phenotype, resulting in diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disorders [1, 2]. Several proteins including transcription factors also undergo dynamic acetylation and deacetylation processesthat affects protein-protein interactions, protein-DNA interactions and cellular localization thereby changing the physiology of the cell. Thus in several disease models HATs and HDACs are attractive targets for manipulating the gene expression by altering their activity by small molecule modulator...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHistone acetyltransferases (<b>HATs)</b> <b>play</b> {{important}} roles in gene regulation and DNA repair by influencing the accessibility of chromatin to transcription factors and repair proteins. Here, we show that deletion of Gcn 5 leads to telomere dysfunction in mouse and human cells. Biochemical studies reveal that depletion of Gcn 5 or ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (Usp 22), which is another bona fide component of the Gcn 5 -containing SAGA complex, increases ubiquitination and turnover of TRF 1, a primary component of the telomeric shelterin complex. Inhibition of the proteasome or overexpression of USP 22 opposes this effect. The USP 22 deubiquitinating module requires association with SAGA complexes for activity, and we find that depletion of Gcn 5 compromises this association in mammalian cells. Thus, our results indicate that Gcn 5 regulates TRF 1 levels through effects on Usp 22 activity and SAGA integrity...|$|R
40|$|Acetylation of {{nucleosomal}} histones by diverse histone acetyltransferases (<b>HAT)</b> <b>plays</b> pivotal {{roles in}} many cellular events. Discoveries of novel HATs and HAT related factors have provided new insights {{to understand the}} roles and mechanisms of histone acetylation. In this study, we identified prominent Histone H 3 acetylation activity in vitro and purified its activity, showing that it is composed of the MYST acetyltransferase Chameau and Enhancer of the Acetyltransferase Chameau (EAChm) family. EAChm is a negatively charged acidic protein retaining aspartate and glutamate. Furthermore, we identified that Chameau and EAChm stimulate transcription in vitro together with purified general transcription factors. In addition, RNA-seq analysis of Chameu KD and EAChm KD S 2 cells suggest that Chameau and EAChm regulate transcription of common genes in vivo. Our results suggest that EAChm regulates gene transcription in Drosophila embryos by enhancing Acetyltransferase Chameau activity...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAcetylation is a {{prominent}} post-translational modification of nucleosomal histone N-terminal tails, which regulates chromatin accessibility. Accordingly, histone acetyltransferases (<b>HATs)</b> <b>play</b> major roles in {{processes such as}} transcription. Here, we show that the HAT Tip 60, which is involved in DNA repair and apoptosis following gamma irradiation, is subjected to proteasome-dependent proteolysis. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Mdm 2, the ubiquitin ligase of the p 53 tumour suppressor, interacts physically with Tip 60 and induces its ubiquitylation and proteasome-dependent degradation. Moreover, a ubiquitin ligase-defective mutant of Mdm 2 {{had no effect on}} Tip 60 stability. Our results indicate that Mdm 2 targets both p 53 and Tip 60, suggesting that these two proteins could be co-regulated with respect to protein stability. Consistent with this hypothesis, Tip 60 levels increased significantly upon UV irradiation of Jurkat cells. Collectively, our results suggest that degradation of Tip 60 could be part of the mechanism leading to cell transformation by Mdm 2...|$|R

The emerging evidences highlighted that both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms including histone modifications {{play a significant role in}} the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Histone deacetylases (HDACs) and acetylation are involved in the regulation of autophagy as well as pathogenesis of DN. Both HDACs and histone acetyltransferases (<b>HATs)</b> <b>play</b> a key role in chromatin remodeling and affect the transcription of various genes involved in the cellular homeostasis, apoptosis, immunity and angiogenesis.
