5|$|The {{most common}} {{molecules}} attacked by oxidation are unsaturated fats; oxidation {{causes them to}} turn rancid. Since oxidized lipids are often discolored and usually have unpleasant tastes such as metallic or sulfurous flavors, {{it is important to}} avoid oxidation in fat-rich foods. Thus, these foods are rarely preserved by drying; instead, they are preserved by smoking, salting or fermenting. Even less <b>fatty</b> <b>foods</b> such as fruits are sprayed with sulfurous antioxidants prior to air drying. Oxidation is often catalyzed by metals, which is why fats such as butter should never be wrapped in aluminium foil or kept in metal containers. Some <b>fatty</b> <b>foods</b> such as olive oil are partially protected from oxidation by their natural content of antioxidants, but remain sensitive to photooxidation. Antioxidant preservatives are also added to fat based cosmetics such as lipstick and moisturizers to prevent rancidity.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} levels of ovarian hormones {{at different stages of}} the cycle have been used to explain eating behaviour changes. Progesterone has been shown to promote fat storage, causing a higher intake of <b>fatty</b> <b>foods</b> during the luteal phase when progesterone levels are higher. Additionally, with a high estrogen level dopamine is ineffective in converting to noradrenaline, a hormone which promotes eating, therefore decreasing appetite. In humans, the level of these ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle have been found to influence binge eating.|$|E
5|$|Various {{studies have}} shown that during the luteal phase woman consume more carbohydrates, {{proteins}} and fats and that 24-hour energy expenditure shows increases between 2.5-11.5%. The increasing intake during the luteal phase may be related to higher preferences for sweet and <b>fatty</b> <b>foods,</b> which occurs naturally and is enhanced during the luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. This is due to the higher metabolic demand during this phase. In particular, women tend to show a cravings for chocolate, with higher cravings during the luteal phase.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fatty</b> <b>food</b> simulants {{currently}} being used are recognized to be unsatisfactory, because vegetable oils {{are difficult to}} analyze and do not yield reproducible results, and n-heptane has altering interactions with test polymers. On the other hand, ethanol and ethanol/water mixtures have been recommended as an alternative <b>fatty</b> <b>food</b> simulant because of their simplicity in analysis and inertness when in contact with many plastics, e. g. polyolefins. To confirm the suitability of ethanol and ethanol/water mixtures {{as a substitute for}} <b>fatty</b> <b>food</b> simulant the migration behavior of plastic additives such as Irganox 1076, Irganox 1010 and Irgafos 168 into them was investigated. The migration of additives from an oriented polypropylene and a low density polyethylene film into 100 per cent ethanol was found to be time-dependent and showed a Fickian diffusion process. Furthermore, the migration value of Irganox 1076 from low density polyethylene into ethanol proved to be comparable to that of n-hept ane.

40|$|Abstract. Phthalic {{acid esters}} (PAEs) {{may be used}} as {{plasticizer}} and softener for the manufacturing of plastic products, especially in polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The residue of PAEs in food may affect human health. The method of qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis of 15 PAEs are established by total ion chromatogram (TIC) and select ion monitor (SIM) of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Combined with the solid phase extraction (SPE) method, PAEs residue of some <b>fatty</b> <b>food</b> in plastic packaging was detected, with the assessment of PAEs residual be discussed.

25|$|Compared to liquid water, {{microwave}} heating is less efficient on fats and sugars (which have a smaller molecular dipole moment). Sugars and triglycerides (fats and oils) absorb microwaves {{due to the}} dipole moments of their hydroxyl groups or ester groups. However, due to the lower specific heat capacity of fats and oils and their higher vaporization temperature, they often attain much higher temperatures inside microwave ovens. This can induce temperatures in oil or very <b>fatty</b> <b>foods</b> like bacon far above the boiling point of water, and high enough to induce some browning reactions, much {{in the manner of}} conventional , braising, or deep fat frying. Foods high in water content and with little oil rarely exceed the boiling temperature of water.|$|E
25|$|PFOA is also {{formed as}} an {{unintended}} byproduct {{in the production}} of fluorotelomers and is present in finished goods treated with fluorotelomers, including those intended for food contact. Fluorotelomers are applied to food contact papers because they are lipophobic: they prevent oil from soaking into the paper from <b>fatty</b> <b>foods.</b> Also, fluorotelomers can be metabolized into PFOA. In a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) study, lipophobic fluorotelomer-based paper coatings (which can be applied to food contact paper in the concentration range of 0.4%) were found to contain 88,000–160,000 parts per billion PFOA, while microwave popcorn bags contained 6–290 parts per billion PFOA. Toxicologists estimate that microwave popcorn could account for about 20% of the PFOA levels measured in an individual consuming 10 bags a year if 1% of the fluorotelomers are metabolized to PFOA.|$|E

The isolation of seven PCDD, ten PCDF, and three coplanar PCB (cPCB) is extended to eight mono-ortho substituted PCB and seven so-called “marker PCB” (Aroclor 1260) for <b>fatty</b> <b>food</b> samples. This enables quan-tification of 35 compounds – including all congeners with a WHO toxic equivalent factor (TEF) – in a single extrac-tion and single purification step. The chromatographic be-haviour of mono-ortho PCB and marker PCB on a variety of adsorbents, including basic alumina, has been studied. Partitioning of analytes through multi-column sequences is described and correlated with their structural and elec-tronic properties, by use of molecular modelling calcula-tions. The fractionation process available with the Power-Prep automated clean-up system enables rapid indepen-dent analysis of the different groups of compounds. Gas chromatography with high resolution mass spectrometry (GC–HRMS) is used for the PCDD/F and cPCB fraction and quadrupole ion-storage tandem in time mass spec-trometry (GC–QISTMS) for analysis of the remaining PCB. A comparison study was performed on quality-con-trol samples and real <b>fatty</b> <b>food</b> samples to evaluate the ro-bustness of the new strategy compared with a reference method. On the basis of this simultaneous clean-up, a rapid simplified strategy for PCDD/F and selected PCB analysis determination is proposed for <b>fatty</b> <b>food</b> samples...|$|R
