5|$|The <b>intercommunality</b> of the Terre des Deux Caps and the {{authorities}} in nearly Landrethun set up a partnership to operate the site under {{the management of the}} existing museum of La Coupole near Saint-Omer. The director of the latter, historian Yves le Maner, designed the contents of a new museum that was constructed at a cost of €360,000.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{opened in}} May 1997. Visitors enter and leave through the Ida railway tunnel, though the rails {{have been removed}} and the floor levelled. Short branch tunnels lead off on either side; {{originally}} used for storage, they now display wartime objects. Headphone stands along the way present multi-lingual accounts of the construction and purpose of the facility. The tour continues along the Mathilde tunnel to reach a lift that has been installed to bring visitors up to the space beneath the dome, where the main exhibition area is located. Focusing {{on the story of}} the V-weapons, life in occupied France, and the conquest of space after the war, the tour presents audio-visual displays in English, French, Dutch and German. The museum houses a large number of original artifacts including a V-1 provided by London's Science Museum and a V-2 provided by the Smithsonian Institution, and incorporates a memorial to the 8,000 people who were shot in or deported from the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region during the war; computer terminals track the paths of several hundred of the deportees. In 2011, the museum welcomed 120,000 visitors. In July 2012, the museum opened a planetarium as part of Cerendac, a newly established Centre de ressources numériques pour le développement de l'accès à la connaissance (Resource Centre for the development of digital access to knowledge). The €6 million centre is funded by the Pas-de-Calais department, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region, the French state, the European Union and the <b>intercommunality</b> of Saint-Omer. Since 2010, the museum has also managed the V-3 site of the Fortress of Mimoyecques.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{sustainable}} development indicators at a local level. For twenty years indicators have been validated both by the international and the French frameworks {{as a tool for}} local sustainability. Identifying and developing a set of indicators demands a reflection on the sustainable development theories and represents a passageway from theory to practice, crystallizing all the unanswered questions left or discrepancies between theories. Analyzing the content of sustainable development indicators (i. e., not how the numerical value is provided but what it measures) seem to be an interesting path to look for what dimensions and interpretations of sustainable development are taken into account by the cities and <b>intercommunalities</b> and how this can give clues on their interpretation of urban sustainability.  It is also an opportunity to explore how the indicators are used and if the municipalities are taking advantages of all their potentialities. After a classification and analysis of more than 1800 indicators distributed between 21 French cities and <b>intercommunalities,</b> several observations have been made. First of all, the different facets on sustainability are taken into account and the connections with French policies are made. However, the quality and coherence are very diverse and uneven from one city and another. The municipalities lack transparency about the evolution of indicators and they are not taking advantages of the communication potential of the indicators towards the public. Also, the indicators are rarely if ever kept on the long term so far. To sum up, indicators of sustainability at a local level represent a way to push the debates and views over sustainable development on a new level.   But they are also encountering obstacles from a lack of knowledge and because of the difficulty to define and apply sustainable development. If knowledge and pedagogy are slowly spreading, much is left to learn about how to create a shareable vision of the future as well as common values and a common culture within a community. ...|$|R

40|$|Urban {{research}} often considers densification {{from the}} perspective of sustainable development and social mix. This essay focuses instead on the social and political stakes involved in densification through the example of a large French metropolitan area. It shows that the densification policies put in place in the Lyon agglomeration cannot be said to succeed in breaking down the historical segregation between its residential and affluent western suburbs (banlieues) and its industrial and working-class eastern ones. The political manoeuvres executed by the institutions implementing densification, and the search for consensus characterizing France's <b>intercommunalities,</b> block any possibility of redistributing functions and social classes at the metropolitan scale, and hence of ending the social specialization of Lyon's suburbs. Moreover, municipalities subjected to pressure from suburban areas carefully assess the profile of residents selected to occupy new housing units—i. e. individuals already residing in the commune in the case of western suburbs, and middle-class individuals hailing from {{the eastern part of the}} agglomeration in the case of eastern suburbs. Densification does not foster social mix at the metropolitan scale, neither does it improve the housing conditions of disadvantaged populations. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|In the Ile-de-France region (surroundings of Paris) {{the news}} cities {{created in the}} 1970 ’s {{were built in the}} heart of arable {{cropping}} systems areas. The agriculture that surrounds these growing cities is threatened by urbanisation but the needs of opened spaces felt by the new city-dwellers and the recent evolution of the urban planning laws in France engender {{at the same time a}} new interest for the agricultural territory. It is the case in the urban district of Evry (Essonne) : a new-born association tries to make lobby to maintain agricultural spaces in the called “Plateau du Centre Essonne”. At their request, we led a multidisciplinary approach aiming at knowing better the current state of agriculture in this territory, its recognized functions by various actors, its place in documents and projects of urban and regional planning. The first results show a diversified and still dynamic agriculture with several forms of adaptation to the urban proximity and several strategies for sustainability in the medium term. Often profitable in an economic point of view, it is frequently recognized by non-farmers actors as for its function of “green lung” and “landscape”. Several typical farms present a patrimonial interest which could be upgraded by helping the farmers to maintain some of their agricultural buildings and by creating a network of discovery footpaths. The importance of this agriculture in urban planning documents is more complex: it is globally protected as an element of the green belt of Paris in the regional frames; it is less the case in their local translation, some municipalities being strongly tempted by the taxes they could obtain by authorizing the creation of new activities areas (enterprises, supermarkets etc.) in spite of the pro-agriculture speechs of some of the mayors. The new urban planning laws are translated locally by several <b>intercommunalities,</b> each one getting its own territory project: four different projects concern the Plateau, three of them cutting it around the concerned municipalities, and one containing it totally. Will the farmers and their local supporters find the ways to make their voices listened and their propositions for the preservation of agricultural activities considered...|$|R
