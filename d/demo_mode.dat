5|$|Andy's {{toys are}} welcomed {{by the other}} toys at Sunnyside, and are given a tour by Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear ("Lotso"), Big Baby, and Ken. The toys choose to stay, except Woody, who {{attempts}} to return to Andy, but is instead found by Bonnie, one of the Sunnyside students. She brings Woody home and plays with him along with her other toys, which are well-treated. Meanwhile, at Sunnyside, a group of toddlers play rough with Andy's toys. Buzz seeks out Lotso to request to have the toys moved to the older children's room, but Lotso declines. At the same time, Mrs. Potato Head, through an eye she inadvertently left in Andy's room, sees Andy searching for the toys. However, before they can leave, Andy's toys are imprisoned by Lotso's gang, guarded by Buzz, whom Lotso switched to <b>Demo</b> <b>Mode</b> (which caused him to believe he is a real space ranger, therefore turning against the other toys). At Bonnie's house, Woody meets a toy clown named Chuckles, who explains to Woody that he, Lotso, and Big Baby once had a beloved owner named Daisy. When the toys were accidentally left behind by Daisy's family during a trip, {{they made their way}} back to her house, where Lotso found that he had been replaced. Lotso lied to Big Baby, saying Daisy had replaced all of them. When they found Sunnyside, Lotso took it over, with Chuckles only getting out because Bonnie took him home, after he was broken, and fixed him.|$|E

50|$|District Judge Bernard Decker {{ruled against}} Artic, {{noting that the}} law does not require work to be written down in the exact way that it is {{perceived}} by the human eye.

The games also repeated in similar ways during subsequent plays. The court likewise rejected Artic's legislative history argument, finding that the discussion only meant to exclude images on TV or computer screens like live broadcasts that were not recorded or fixed elsewhere (e.g., on a memory chip or videotape) such that they could be reproduced.|$|R

5000|$|Production of {{the game}} began in early 1991 but was then delayed as {{programmer}} Jools Jameson worked on Mega Drive conversions of other games. The proposed Cannon Fodder {{had been part of}} a four-game deal with Robert Maxwell's software publisher, which was liquidated after the businessman's death. Unusually for an independent developer, Sensible had little difficulty in finding publishers and after work resumed on the game, concluded a deal with Virgin in May 1993. The creators chose Virgin as it [...] "seemed like a good bet" [...] (Hare) as well as because of the straightforwardness of UK head Tim Chaney. Several months before its release, elements {{of the game}} were combined with Sensible Soccer, to create Sensible Soccer Meets Bulldog Blighty. This modified Sensible Soccer <b>demo</b> featured a <b>mode</b> of play that the ball with a timed hand grenade.

2500|$|Early {{criticism}} {{was directed at}} Infinite less stylized art direction. Alex Donaldson of VG247 stated that [...] "the art style just feels off — or at worst, unfinished...as it stands right now the art style is a mistake when compared to Marvel vs. Capcom 3." [...] Sergio Figueroa of Gamereactor and Nick Valdez of Destructoid also expressed disappointment with the visuals, particularly the in-game character models and the HUD. Figueroa wrote that [...] "the developers have chosen a simplistic and, in our opinion, insufficiently detailed character design that we think diminishes the fighters' personalities." [...] The release of the story <b>mode</b> <b>demo</b> was also criticized. Polygon David Cabrera felt the demo was a [...] "squandered opportunity" [...] by Capcom that [...] "actively [...] the good points {{of the game and}} [...] its failings," [...] such as unpolished character models and awkward voice acting, while Game Informers Ben Reeves thought the demo lacked entertaining moments and failed to showcase Marvel and Capcom's [...] "dream matchups" [...] in any meaningful or creative way. Following complaints about the quality of certain character models, particularly on the Capcom side of the roster, the developers announced plans for a day-one patch that would focus on artistic improvements.|$|R
