Gout occurs more commonly in those who <b>eat</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> meat, drink a lot of beer, or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by seeing the crystals in joint fluid or tophus. Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack.|$|E

For each player, there is also a 1-Pound Pass, which adds one pound to his or her weight loss at weigh in.
