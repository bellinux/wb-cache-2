40|$|Many {{government}} organizations {{consist of}} complex application portfolios with significant redundant <b>functionalities</b> {{and in order}} to run this portfolio, 80 % of the IT budget is consumed by maintenance cost. Eliminating redundant <b>functionalities</b> improves efficiency, operational performance and decreases maintenance costs. A midsized Swedish municipality has a complex application portfolio with redundant <b>functionalities,</b> and this study aims to suggest actions for reducing redundant <b>functionalities</b> of citizen related applications. In order to identify redundant <b>functionalities</b> in a complex organization such as the government, all surrounding complexities need to be identified. Therefore, by performing a literature study, Application Portfolio Rationalization has been selected as an approach for reducing redundant <b>functionalities.</b> An online survey was conducted for gathering data about applications and the total response rate was 46. 5 %. The collected data was analyzed to identify complexities and applications with similar purpose and functions. Finally, actions were suggested for reducing redundant <b>functionalities</b> of applications by consolidating them with the “best-in-class” application, and implementing a central database for reducing redundant storage of data by the applications...|$|R

The keeper aspect groups <b>functionalities</b> related to the operations on shared data. The coordinator aspect groups the <b>functionalities</b> related to the temporal sequencing of activities (performed by the groupware users).

Some groupware systems tend to provide <b>functionalities</b> that, in their majority, belong to only one of these aspects. Thus, a synchronous editor such as GROVE [...] ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe fast {{development}} of the Self-Organizing Network (SON) technology in mobile networks renders critical the problem of coordinating SON <b>functionalities</b> operating simultaneously. SON <b>functionalities</b> {{can be viewed as}} control loops that may need to be coordinated to guarantee conflict free operation, to enforce stability of the network and to achieve performance gain. This paper proposes a distributed solution for coordinating SON <b>functionalities.</b> It uses Rosen's concave games framework in conjunction with convex optimization. The SON <b>functionalities</b> are modeled as linear Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) s. The stability of the system is first evaluated using a basic control theory approach. The coordination solution consists in finding a linear map (called coordination matrix) that stabilizes the system of SON <b>functionalities.</b> It is proven that the solution remains valid in a noisy environment using Stochastic Approximation. A practical example involving three different SON <b>functionalities</b> deployed in Base Stations (BSs) of a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed method...|$|R

Readers use these marks to organize their reading for later review and retrieval. This combination of reading with critical thinking and learning is called active reading. Active reading is a fundamental part of education and knowledge work and often requires readers {{to move from one}} text to another to satisfy their information needs.
