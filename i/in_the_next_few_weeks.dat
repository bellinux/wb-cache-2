5|$|Nintendo's {{attorney}} (and future board member) Howard Lincoln was {{at first}} inclined to settle for $5–7 million. Eventually, however, he decided to fight, reassuring {{the head of the}} company's U.S. division, Minoru Arakawa, that this was a sign that Nintendo had made it big. On May 6, Arakawa and Lincoln met with Coleco and Universal in Los Angeles. Hadl reiterated his stance that Donkey Kong infringed Universal's rights to King Kong. Lincoln countered that Nintendo had discovered many unlicensed uses of King Kongs name and characters and that Universal's trademark on these was less than 10 years old. In private, Greenberg tried to persuade Nintendo to sign a licensing agreement; he had not told them that he had already done so. By the end of the meeting, Hadl agreed to send a chain of title to Nintendo regarding Universal's ownership of the King Kong name. When this failed to materialize <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> Lincoln prodded Universal again. They responded with more demands for royalties.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Newcastle United were linked with a £6 million bid for Brown, as a {{replacement}} for their outgoing captain Kevin Nolan. Brown stated {{that he did not want}} to leave Celtic and that he felt privileged to be the captain. He also said that he wanted to sign a new contract as his current deal was to expire at the end of the season. Internazionale and Juventus were also reportedly looking to sign him on a free transfer if he did not sign a new contract. After protracted talks, Brown announced on 29 August that he was to sign a new contract <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b> Due to his SPL suspension incurred at the end of the 2010–11 season, Brown's first match of the new campaign was Scotland's 2–1 win over Denmark on 10 August. He suffered an ankle injury in this match, but played in the next five games for Celtic and the next international match. He missed Celtic's 4–0 win over Motherwell, on 10 September, due to the injury and then the 2–0 loss to Atlético Madrid five days later.|$|E

25|$|In December 1924, {{several days}} after the last ship left the port, Welch treated a few {{children}} for what he first diagnosed as sore throats or tonsillitis, initially dismissing diphtheria since it is extremely contagious {{and he would have}} expected to see the same symptoms in their family members or other cases around town. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> as the number of tonsillitis cases grew and four children died whom he {{had not been able to}} autopsy, Welch became increasingly concerned about diphtheria.|$|E
25|$|But the August 12 {{agreement}} collapsed, and 5,000–7,000 UFW workers {{struck the}} Salinas Valley growers on August 23 {{in what was}} the largest farm worker strike in U.S. history. More workers walked off the job <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> while other unions supported the strike, shipments of fresh lettuce nationwide almost ceased, {{and the price of}} lettuce doubled almost overnight. Lettuce growers lost $500,000 a day. A state district court enjoined Chávez personally and the UFW as an organization from engaging in picketing, but both Chávez and the union refused to obey the court's orders. In late September 1970, the UFW asked consumers to join in a nationwide boycott of all lettuce which had not been picked by members of the United Farm Workers. Violence, sporadic at first but increasingly widespread, began to occur in the fields. On November 4, 1970 a UFW regional office was bombed.|$|E

25|$|Since {{most of the}} {{fighting}} strength of Aragon was killed or captured in the siege, the two corps of Junot and Mortier rapidly overran the Ebro valley. Grandjean's division seized Caspe and Alcañiz before moving south as far as Morella. Badly overextended, he abandoned Morella soon after. On 5 April, Napoleon ordered Mortier's corps to withdraw from Aragon, leaving Junot's corps too weak to hold the province. On 5 May at Monzón, Spanish guerillas inflicted a defeat on one of Grandjean's brigades led by Pierre-Joseph Habert. His other brigade under Anne Gilbert de Laval was forced to relinquish Alcañiz to a Spanish army under Joaquín Blake on 19 May. On this day, Junot was replaced {{in command of the}} III Corps by Louis-Gabriel Suchet. In his first independent command, Suchet received a drubbing from Blake at the Battle of Alcañiz on 23 May 1809. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> Suchet reorganized, paid and properly uniformed his small corps. He also dismissed a number of officers. Grandjean was replaced by Laval and sent back to France.|$|E

2500|$|Suddenly and unexpectedly, on 28 June 1938 (two {{days before}} the VFL's {{clearance}} applications closed), Pratt appeared at South Melbourne's Tuesday night training session and, despite the medical advice that {{had been given to}} him, he declared that, despite his chronic arthritis, he wanted to play again with South Melbourne, and that he would train in earnest, and was hoping (despite his lack of condition, and his long absence from the playing field) to be selected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b> He reported that he had previously found that [...] "he was not inconvenienced while on the field", although he did experience great discomfort for some time after each game; and, also, he said, he was confident that, although he had a chronic injury, playing VFL football would not do his injury any further harm.|$|E
2500|$|Paramount {{declined}} to produce Babylon 5, but later announced Deep Space Nine was in development, {{two months after}} Warner Bros. announced its plans for Babylon 5. Straczynski stated that, {{even though he was}} confident that Deep Space Nine producer/creators Rick Berman and Michael Piller had not seen this material, he suspected that Paramount executives used his bible and scripts to steer development of Deep Space Nine. He and Warner did not file suit against Paramount, largely because Straczynski didn't see it as a productive option, with negative repercussions for both TV series. In 1993 he responded to a Deep Space Nine fan who saw the lack of legal action as proof that Straczynski's allegation was unfounded, [...] "If there is any (to use your term) winking and nudging going on, it's on the level of 'Okay, YOU (Paramount) know what happened, and *I* know what happened, but let's try to be grownup about it for now,' though I must say that the shapechanging thing nearly tipped me back over the edge again. [...] If there are no more major similarities that crop up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> or months, with luck we can continue that way." ...|$|E

60|$|I do {{not know}} if you have had any {{experience}} of suburban literary societies, but the one that flourished under the eye of Mrs. Willoughby Smethurst at Wood Hills was rather more so than the average. With my feeble powers of narrative, I cannot hope to make clear to you all that Cuthbert Banks endured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b> And, even if I could, I doubt if I should do so. It is all very well to excite pity and terror, as Aristotle recommends, but there are limits. In the ancient Greek tragedies it was an ironclad rule that all the real rough stuff should take place off-stage, and I shall follow this admirable principle. It will suffice if I say merely that J. Cuthbert Banks had a thin time. After attending eleven debates and fourteen lectures on vers libre Poetry, the Seventeenth-Century Essayists, the Neo-Scandinavian Movement in Portuguese Literature, and other subjects of a similar nature, he grew so enfeebled that, on the rare occasions when he had time for a visit to the links, he had to take a full iron for his mashie shots.|$|E
60|$|I got {{together}} and placed on one file all my notes; and the net result was not cheering. I read them a second time. There was nothing {{that might not have}} been compiled at second-hand from other people's books--except, perhaps, the story of the fight in the harbor. The adventures of a Viking bad been written many times before; the history of a Greek galley-slave was no new thing, and though I wrote both, who could challenge or confirm the accuracy of my details? I might as well tell a tale of two thousand years hence. The Lords of Life and Death were as cunning as Grish Chunder had hinted. They would allow nothing to escape that might trouble or make easy the minds of men. Though I was convinced of this, yet I could not leave the tale alone. Exaltation followed reaction, not once, but twenty times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b> My moods varied with the March sunlight and flying clouds. By night or in the beauty of a spring morning I perceived that I could write that tale and shift continents thereby. In the wet, windy afternoons, I saw that the tale might indeed be written, but would be nothing more than a faked, false-varnished, sham-rusted piece of Wardour Street work at the end. Then I blessed Charlie in many ways-- though it was no fault of his. He seemed to be busy with prize competitions, and I saw less and less of him as the weeks went by and the earth cracked and grew ripe to spring, and the buds swelled in their sheaths. He did not care to read or talk of what he had read, and there was a new ring of self-assertion in his voice. I hardly cared to remind him of the galley when we met; but Charlie alluded to it on every occasion, always as a story from which money was to be made.|$|E
