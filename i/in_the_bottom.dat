5|$|Australia {{has participated}} in {{biathlon}} at every Olympics since 1984 except for 2002; Kerryn Rim's eighth place in 1994 in the 15km individual event was their best result. Cameron Morton represented Australia in 2006 and finished <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> 10% {{in each of his}} two races. In 2010, Australia's sole representative Alexei Almoukov came second last in his event—one competitor did not finish. Rim's result remains the only top-20 finish by an Australian in the discipline, and more than 80% of Australian entrants have finished <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> half of the field, including many <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> fifth.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees {{opened the}} scoring {{in the first}} inning with two runs, but the Phillies {{answered}} with back-to-back doubles by Shane Victorino and Chase Utley <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the inning. The Phillies tied the game <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the fourth as Ryan Howard singled, stole second, and scored on a single by Pedro Feliz. Replays showed that Howard did not touch home plate as he slid across; however, the Yankees did not appeal. Swisher led off the fifth inning with a walk, scoring on a single by Derek Jeter, and Melky Cabrera scored on a single by Damon. Park relieved Blanton in the seventh and held the Yankees scoreless. Chase Utley hit his third home run of the series <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the seventh with two outs. Dámaso Marte struck out Howard to end the inning. After a game-tying home run by Feliz, Lidge entered the game in the ninth and gave up a two-out single to Damon. With Teixeira batting, Damon stole second and advanced to third as the base was uncovered due to the pull shift against Teixeira. Rodriguez put the Yankees ahead with a double to left field, scoring Damon. Posada added to that lead with a single which scored Teixeira, who had singled, and Rodriguez. Mariano Rivera entered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the ninth and notched his second save of the series.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{competed in}} all three sports in 2006. In bobsleigh, Australia competed in the two-man and two-woman events, and was the highest-placed country to miss {{qualifications}} for an Olympic berth in the four-man event at the 2006 Challenge Cup. The Australian Olympic Committee unsuccessfully tried to have the Brazilian bobsleigh team thrown out due {{to the use of}} drugs by Armando dos Santos, so that Australia would take its place. Hannah Campbell-Pegg came 23rd in luge, and Michelle Steele, a beach flag sprinter chosen from a systematic program to identify a potential skeleton medal-winner from female non-winter athletes, came 13th due to inexperience with the intimidating and technical track. Shaun Boyle represented Australia in the men's skeleton and placed 22nd. In 2010, Australia were represented in every bobsled event, but all finished last, failed to finish due to crashes or had to withdraw due to injuries sustained in earlier races. Australia's sole luger and two male skeleton racers came <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> 20%, while Emma Lincoln-Smith and Melissa Hoar came 10th and 12th respectively. Until 2010, Australia had placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> half of the field in every sliding event it has entered, and came last in the luge in 1994. Lincoln-Smith's effort in the skeleton in 2010 changed this record.|$|E
5|$|Australia has {{competed in}} {{cross-country}} skiing in 1952, 1960, 1968, 1980 to 1998, and since 2006. The two Australian representatives in 1952 occupied {{the last two}} places, and before 1984, no Australian finished above the bottom 15% of racers. Results have slowly improved, but most Australian entrants {{in the last two}} decades have placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> 25%. In 1992, Anthony Evans became the first Australian to place in the top half, finishing in the top 40 in two events. Australia fielded three competitors in cross-country skiing in 2006, its largest contingent in the event. Paul Murray and Esther Bottomley competed in the sprint; Clare-Louise Brumley was selected for the pursuit and 30km freestyle, but competed only in the former due to illness. Nobody broke into the top half in their respective races. At the 2010 Games, Australia had three representatives. Ben Sim came in the top half in one event, but he, Bottomley and Murray finished <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> 20% in their remaining four events. Australia has never competed in ski jumping, and their sole entry in Nordic combined was by Hal Nerdal in 1960, who came last.|$|E

5|$|Branca {{began the}} game by {{retiring}} the first three batters; Eddie Stanky and Alvin Dark flied out while Don Mueller grounded out. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the first, Carl Furillo grounded out, and Pee Wee Reese hit a single. After Duke Snider flied out, Reese was caught stealing second base to end the inning. In the second inning, Branca retired all three hitters; when the Dodgers came up to bat, Jackie Robinson flied out and Roy Campanella grounded out. Andy Pafko scored the game's first run with a home run to left field to make the score 1–0. After the third out, Willie Mays walked to start the third inning, and after the first out Stanky got the Giants' first hit, a single. After a fly out by Dark, the Giants remained without a run; Hearn retired all three batters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the third to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|Chad Durbin {{relieved}} Happ {{in the top}} of the seventh. He walked Johnny Damon, {{who then}} stole second base. Rodriguez was then hit by a pitch, and Damon scored on a single by Jorge Posada. Joba Chamberlain relieved Pettitte <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the seventh and retired the side in order. Brett Myers retired the first two batters {{in the top of}} the eighth, but Hideki Matsui then hit a solo home run pinch hitting for Chamberlain. Phil Hughes pitched a third of an inning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the ninth and allowed a solo home run to Carlos Ruiz before being relieved by Mariano Rivera. Rivera closed out the game, throwing just five pitches to record the final two outs. This game was Pettitte's 17th career postseason win, extending his MLB record.|$|E

5|$|Granderson and Daniel Murphy {{were the}} two most {{productive}} hitters in the Mets lineup during their 2015 postseason run to the World Series. While Murphy cooled off in the World Series against the Kansas City Royals, Granderson {{continued to be a}} consistent threat for the Mets out of the leadoff spot and also had three home runs and five RBIs in that World Series. In Game 1, after the Royals tied the game in the ninth inning with a home run off Mets closer Jeurys Familia, Granderson made an excellent leaping catch with nobody out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the 11th inning, off the bat of the Royals fastest runner Jarrod Dyson, preventing what would have at least been a lead off triple and likely saving the game at the time, though the Royals would go on to win the game anyway <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the 14th inning on a sacrifice fly by Eric Hosmer. Throughout the series, playing right field, Granderson played the most consistent and solid defense of any Mets fielder.|$|E
