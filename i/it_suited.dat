5|$|In 2011, Miles {{returns to}} Home and Away {{with a new}} look. Miles had lost weight, cut his hair short and grew a beard. Off-screen Quong Tart had such a busy {{schedule}} that he lost weight. When he revealed his new look to producers, they were so impressed they decided to change Miles' image, because <b>it</b> <b>suited</b> the storyline.|$|E
5|$|Bradman had {{words with}} Barnes after this match {{about his new}} role as an opener. Barnes later wrote: He asked me how I liked it. I said <b>it</b> <b>suited</b> me. 'You batted very well in this game,' he said, 'but not quite as an opener. You were looking for runs all the time. I think {{what you want to}} watch as an opener is not getting out... What is needed from my openers, and is most important, is {{patience}} and plenty of it.' I was completely willing to be guided by anything that Bradman wanted me to do.|$|E
5|$|The League of Nations {{has been}} a disappointing failure.... It {{has been a}} failure, not because the United States did not join it; but because the great powers have been unwilling to apply {{sanctions}} except where <b>it</b> <b>suited</b> their individual national interests to do so, and because Democracy, on which the original concepts of the League rested for support, has collapsed over half the world.|$|E

The [...] "green belt" [...] {{is a kind}} of belt used by men to {{identify}} themselves as having emerged from adolescence and having become eligible. A man who has danced the arcan is sometimes called arcănit ("arkaned"), bun de oi ("good for sheep", i.e. good to be a shepherd), bun de însurat ("good to be married").|$|R

5|$|Robert Dudley was counted among Elizabeth's special friends by PhilipII's {{envoy to}} the English court a week before Queen Mary's death. On 18November 1558, the morning after Elizabeth's accession, Dudley {{witnessed}} the surrender of the Great Seal to her at Hatfield. He became Master of the Horse on the same day. This was an important court position entailing close attendance on the sovereign. <b>It</b> <b>suited</b> him, as he was an excellent horseman and showed great professional interest in royal transport and accommodation, horse breeding, and the supply of horses for all occasions. Dudley was also entrusted with organising and overseeing {{a large part of}} the Queen's coronation festivities.|$|E
25|$|Plautus {{also made}} use of {{alternative}} forms, such as sim/siem, dem/duim, surpio/surripio, dixti/dixisti, malim/mavelim, ille/illĭc, me/med, te/ted, hau/haud, when <b>it</b> <b>suited</b> his metre. In words ending in -us, such as fluctibu(s), the -s could be omitted.|$|E
25|$|Quite {{commonly}} in Plautus the two adjacent vowels {{in words}} such as eosdem, ni(h)il, eum, eo, huius, eius, cuius, mi(h)i, meas, tuom were merged into one syllable by {{a process known as}} synizesis. However, if <b>it</b> <b>suited</b> the metre, they could also be kept separate.|$|E

25|$|Her film {{choices were}} often unconventional: Davis sought roles as {{manipulators}} and killers {{in an era}} when actresses usually preferred to play sympathetic characters, and she excelled in them.

25|$|The {{feeling in}} many {{quarters}} {{was that when}} the Australian Board first found Packer at their throats, {{the rest of the}} cricket world supported them to the hilt; even to the extent of highly expensive court cases which cricket could ill afford. Now, when <b>it</b> <b>suited</b> Australia, they had brushed their friends aside to meet their own ends.|$|E
25|$|HERE was a {{union in}} decline when Hanley took over. Over {{the next two}} decades, union {{membership}} fell to 230,000 from 400,000. But Hanley could be a vigorous organizer when <b>it</b> <b>suited</b> him, and union membership recovered by 20,000 in the 1990s. In the late 1980s, Hanley hired John Wilhelm, an organizer and future {{president of the international}} union.|$|E

25|$|One of Moorman's best-known works was McWilliams's Sky Kiss, {{the piece}} {{he had written}} for himself in 1968. After realizing that <b>it</b> <b>suited</b> Moorman's {{abilities}} better than his own, he gave the piece to her, along with the parachute harness he had used to attach himself to the balloons. Later performances of the piece were done over the Sydney Opera House, the Danube River, and the Mojave Desert, among others.|$|E
25|$|Francisco Vázquez de Coronado {{visited the}} {{neighboring}} Wichita in 1541 where he encountered a Pawnee chief from Harahey in Nebraska. Nothing much is mentioned of the Pawnee until the 17th and 18th centuries when successive incursions of Spanish, French and English settlers attempted to enlarge their possessions. The tribes tended to make alliances as and when <b>it</b> <b>suited</b> them. Different Pawnee subtribes could make treaties with warring European powers without disrupting their underlying unity; the Pawnee were masters at unity within diversity.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of Oswiu's reign was spent {{in the shadow of}} Penda, who {{dominated}} much of Britain from 642 until 655, seemingly making and breaking kings as <b>it</b> <b>suited</b> him. The future kingdom of Northumbria was still composed of two distinct kingdoms in Oswiu's lifetime. The northerly kingdom of Bernicia, which extended from the River Tees to the Firth of Forth, was ruled by Oswiu. The kingdom of Deira, lying between the North York Moors and the Humber, was ruled by a series of Oswiu's kinsmen, initially as a separate kingdom, later as a form of appanage for Oswiu's sons.|$|E

25|$|As {{the series}} progresses, Creek {{gradually}} changes from an asocial anorak {{to a man}} {{with a great deal of}} wit and charm. This helps to fuel the romantic thread between him and Maddy. Jonathan's trademark duffle coat worn in the first series was actually Alan Davies' own coat that he wore to the auditions; it helped him win the role, as the writer and producers thought <b>it</b> <b>suited</b> the character. After the first series, Jonathan's coat was supplied by the wardrobe department. Davies kept the original at his home, and wore it again for the 2009 New Year's special.|$|E
25|$|Yet the Union of Industrialists {{were not}} only {{interested}} in cash for their weapons, they wanted a political concession. They feared the arrival of socialism in Germany and were irate at the KPD and Social Democrats objecting to providing funds {{for the development of}} new armored cruisers. Stalin would have had no compunction about ordering the German Communists to change sides if <b>it</b> <b>suited</b> his purpose. He had negotiated with the German armaments makers throughout the summer of 1928 and was determined to modernize his armed forces. From 1929 onwards, therefore, the Communists voted faithfully with the far right DNVP and Hitler's NSDAP in the Reichstag despite fighting them in the streets.|$|E
25|$|Between 1920 and 1924, Ivogün toured {{twice in}} the United States on her own, and {{developed}} a large following there. The couple toured there widely together between December 1924 and late February 1925, when, after Willem Mengelberg had failed to persuade Erb to sing the St Matthew Passion in New York City, amid press sensations offering to 'buy' the performance, Erb left Maria to complete her tour and went home. He had to deliver Matthew Passions twice each in Munich, Elberfeld, Dortmund, Hagen, Cologne and Haarlem, all between 22 March and 13 April. America did not suit Erb as <b>it</b> <b>suited</b> Ivogün, and although their partnership continued for several years, they began to go their separate ways.|$|E

25|$|Montgomery was {{advanced}} to KCB and promoted to full general. He kept the initiative, applying superior strength when <b>it</b> <b>suited</b> him, forcing Rommel {{out of each}} successive defensive position. On 6 March 1943, Rommel's attack on the over-extended Eighth Army at Medenine (Operation Capri) with the largest concentration of German armour in North Africa was successfully repulsed. At the Mareth Line, 20 to 27 March, when Montgomery encountered fiercer frontal opposition than he had anticipated, he switched his major effort into an outflanking inland pincer, backed by low-flying RAF fighter-bomber support. For his role in North Africa {{he was awarded the}} Legion of Merit by the United States government in the rank of Chief Commander.|$|E
25|$|However Tu felix Austria nube {{was perhaps}} more romantic than {{strictly}} realistic, since Maximilian was not slow {{to wage war}} when <b>it</b> <b>suited</b> his purpose. Having settled matters with France in 1493, he was soon involved in the long Italian Wars against France (1494–1559). In addition to the wars against the French, there were the wars for Swiss independence. The Swabian War of 1499 marked the last phase of this struggle against the Habsburgs. Following defeat at the Battle of Dornach in 1499, Austria was forced to recognise Swiss independence at the Treaty of Basel in 1499, a process that was finally formalised by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. This was significant as the Habsburgs had originated in Switzerland, their ancestral home being Habsburg Castle.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{strategic}} location between the Indian nations, who alternately were {{allies of the}} French and British as <b>it</b> <b>suited</b> them, plus its location through gaps into the Alleghenies further west, the area's development was viewed with increasing apprehension by the French and their Indian allies. In July 1755, during the French and Indian War, hostile Shawnee Indians equipped and armed by France attacked the frontier outpost at Draper's Meadow, then still consisting of a small encampment with around twenty pioneer settlers. About four settlers {{were killed in the}} attacks, and five were taken captive to Kentucky by the Shawnee, among them Mary Draper Ingles, who later escaped. The memorial to Draper's Meadow massacre was dedicated on a bridge located near Duck Pond. By the end of the war, Draper's Meadow was deserted.|$|E
