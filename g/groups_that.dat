5|$|A {{study by}} Polman, Pollmann, and Poehlman found that sharing {{initials}} with members {{in a group}} can increase the quality of group work. In a study ofundergraduatestudents they found that groups sharing initials performed better than <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> did not. <b>Groups</b> <b>that</b> had {{a higher proportion of}} shared initials exceeded groups with a lower proportion of shared initials.|$|E

5|$|MS is {{more common}} in people who live farther from the equator, {{although}} exceptions exist. These exceptions include ethnic <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> are at low risk far from the equator such as the Samis, Amerindians, Canadian Hutterites, New Zealand Māori, and Canada's Inuit, as well as <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> have a relatively high risk close to the equator such as Sardinians, inland Sicilians, Palestinians and Parsis. The cause of this geographical pattern is not clear. While the north-south gradient of incidence is decreasing, as of 2010 it is still present.|$|E

40|$|Stability {{and change}} of moral {{disengagement}} {{were examined in}} a sample of 366 adolescents from ages 14 to 20 years. Four developmental trajectories were identified: (a) nondisengaged <b>group</b> <b>that</b> started with initially low levels followed by an important decline, (b) normative <b>group</b> <b>that</b> started with initially moderate levels followed by a decline, (c) later desister <b>group</b> <b>that</b> started with initially high-medium levels followed by an increase from 14 to 16 years and an even steeper decline from 16 to 20 years, and (d) chronic <b>group</b> <b>that</b> started with and maintained medium-high levels. The results attest that adolescents who maintained higher levels of moral disengagement were more likely to show frequent aggressive and violent acts in late adolescence...|$|R

5|$|A {{study on}} the {{carpenter}} ant Camponotus floridanus found a special surface hydrocarbon on queen-laid eggs. Workers in the colony with the queen's eggs refrained from egg-laying, whereas other <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> did not have queen-laid eggs showed worker reproduction. Thus, the hydrocarbon could act as a signal to alert workers to halt reproduction. More generally, however, the authors concluded that the hydrocarbons were a fertility signal. It is still unknown {{as to how the}} decision to restrain reproduction occurs or what minimum threshold of fertility in the queen is needed to reduce worker reproduction.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{historical}} coastal Asian groups were driven to near-extinction in short order by Japanese industrial hunts. Those <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> once migrated along western Japan to the East China Sea were likely wiped out much earlier, as the last catches on Amami Oshima were between the 1910s and the 1930s, and the last known stranding records on the Japanese archipelago, excluding the Ryukyu Islands, were over a half-century ago. Commercial catches were continued until 1965 and whaling stations targeting blues were mainly placed along the Hokkaido and Sanriku coasts.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{religious}} and ethnic discrimination, Roman Catholics in the late 19th century were regularly excluded from labor unions, popular fraternal organizations, and other organized <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> provided such social services. Papal encyclicals issued by the Holy See prohibited Catholics from participating as lodge members within Freemasonry. McGivney intended to create an alternative organization.
