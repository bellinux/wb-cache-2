The main {{objective of this}} study was to check the role played by <b>hydroperoxides</b> in the luminescence of three oxidized polymers: polyoctenamer, an ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM), and polypropylene. The <b>hydroperoxides</b> of pre-oxidized polymers (photo-oxidized or hydroperoxidized) were transformed using photolysis or dimethyl sulfide (DMS) treatment. The chemiluminescence of the polymer samples was measured before and after treatment and decomposition of <b>hydroperoxides</b> monitored with IR spectroscopy and thermal analyses. Surprisingly, all the photolysed polymers retained strong luminescence that is not entirely explained by the presence of <b>hydroperoxides.</b> On the contrary, two of the three polymers showed a quenching of luminescence after DMS treatment. Two conclusions can be drawn. First, the results clearly indicate that the luminescence of oxidized polymers does not only depend on the presence of <b>hydroperoxides.</b> The second conclusion concerns the origin of the remaining chemiluminescence after photolysis and the quenching observed after DMS treatment. As photolysis mainly leads to the formation of carbonyl compounds and DMS treatment to the production of alcohols, it is proposed that carbonyl compounds are probably involved in the chemiluminescence of oxidized polymers, especially through associations with remaining <b>hydroperoxides...</b>|$|R

40|$|Summary: Alkyl <b>hydroperoxides</b> {{are reduced}} to {{alcohols}} {{in the presence of}} DPNH and homogeneous rubredoxin and rubredoxin-DPN reductase from Pseudomonas oleovorans. The reaction does not occur when TPNH is substituted for DPNH or when rubredoxins from anaerobic bacteria are substituted for the P. oleovorans nonheme iron protein. The reaction appears to have broad substrate specificity; 1 -octyl, 2 -octyl, cyclohexyl, and cumyl <b>hydroperoxides</b> are all reduced at sig-nificant rates. The reduction of alkyl <b>hydroperoxides</b> is inhibited by cyanide, as is the hydroxylation of alkanes and fatty acids in the same enzyme system supplemented with the w-hydroxylase. Previous studies in this laboratory have shown that alkanes (1, 2) and fatty acids (3, 4) undergo hydroxylation in enzyme preparations of Pseudomonas oleovorans according to the equation: RCH 3 f DPNH + H+ + 02 +RCH 20 H + DPN+ + H 20. The three enzymes found to be required in the overall reaction (5) were purified and identified as rubredoxin (6, 7) rubredoxin-DPN reductase (a), and an o-hydroxylase (9).
