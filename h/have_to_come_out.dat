25|$|Hennepin County {{claimed that}} {{accepting}} the price set by an eminent domain judge {{was not an}} option for them, due to the infrastructure cap. Any additional money needed for the land would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of some other piece of infrastructure. If the price set by a judge came in over their budget, they would have no funds to pay, and the project could collapse. But eminent domain did offer them the advantage of getting started on construction while working out the details of the land price later.|$|E
25|$|Anyway, I keep picturing {{all these}} little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around – nobody big, I mean – except me. And I'm {{standing}} {{on the edge of}} some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff – I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.|$|E

500|$|The {{controversy}} promoted polemics regarding September Morn and censorship, {{and multiple}} editorial cartoons; one depicted {{a young woman}} bathing, only her head showing, with a caption attributed to Comstock reading [...] "Don't you suppose I can imagine what is UNDER the water?". Comstock called the work [...] "demoralizing in the extreme and especially calculated to excite immodesty in the young", arguing {{that it must be}} suppressed {{in the interest of the}} children. He emphasized that [...] "the law is the law... the picture will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the window". Reverend Sydney Ussher of St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church took a more moderate approach, explaining that [...] "so vivid a display of nudity as September Morn" [...] would best not be displayed in the United States, owing to the people's relative lack of appreciation for art.|$|E
2500|$|On October 22, 2012, {{following}} a presidential debate between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, Coulter published the following tweet from her official Twitter account: [...] "I highly approve of Romney's {{decision to be}} kind and gentle to the retard," [...] drawing stiff criticism for her use of a word which some find offensive to describe {{the president of the}} United States. [...] The Special Olympics condemned Coulter in a tweet shortly after Coulter's. On The Alan Colmes Show, Coulter stated that she does not regret her use of the word, saying, [...] "'Retard' had been used colloquially to just mean 'loser' for 30 years. But no, these aggressive victims <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> and tell you what words to use." ...|$|E
2500|$|I'm {{writing this}} and I feel so excited and nervous {{all at the}} same time. Everytime I think about what I'm about to do I get the biggest {{butterflies}} [...] For over a year, I've been in the studio writing my own songs and working towards making my own record. The time has come where I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of my safe bubble that is the studio and share my music with you... butterflies just got worse [...] I've had the incredible opportunity to work with some of my favourite artists, DJs and producers on my album. I have had the most amazing time and I have learnt so much. It was important that my record was personal to me. I {{wanted to be able to}} look back on the album and know that I have honestly put 100% of myself into it. I've written songs and stories that I have wanted to write for a long time. I really hope that you're able to relate to my music, because that really is what it's all about.. So here goes, I'm taking a big leap, but it's going to be the best fun ever.|$|E

I'd sort of be the referee, try to resolve it so that we could get back to work. So there was that side of it. Everybody knows there was {{friction}} {{between the two of them}} on the stage. In the beginning, Bruce was just a guy’s guy. Let's just say he evolved. Over the years, he went from being the crew's best friend and just being grateful for the work and all of that to realizing that he was going to be a movie star and wanting to move on. Part of that was because of his strained relationship with Cybill. That sometimes made the set a very unpleasant place to be. Cybill – I got along with her very well at times, other times I’d have to be the one who said you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the trailer and go to work. In fairness to her, she was in the makeup chair at six thirty in the morning with pages of dialogue she hadn’t seen before, she'd work very long hours, and then be back in the makeup chair at six thirty the next morning." ...|$|E
2500|$|After tea on {{the second}} day of the Second Test at Sydney Australia were 24/1 after Arthur Morris was bowled by Bill Edrich on a wet wicket suited to the England bowling attack. [...] "On a stormy Saturday Barnes and Johnson angered the crowd by making made 8 appeals against the light in 11 minutes...This {{stalling}} saved Australia losing more than Morris's wicket and the granting of the last appeal enabled Bradman to rest a strained leg for Monday". The umpires gave in to the constant appealing and the batsmen were allowed to retire an hour before stumps. Clif Cary opined in his radio commentary that the light was bright enough to play by and the umpires had been pressured into a decision by the Australian batsmen, as did the English pressmen. They were labelled [...] "biased, unsportsmanlike squealers" [...] and that Barnes and his captain Bradman would never used such underhand tactics. When the batsmen returned next day Barnes survived the early bad wicket and went on the make 234, his highest Test score, adding 405 with Bradman in what still is the highest Test partnership in Australia. Bradman had received permission from Hammond to use a substitute fielder earlier in the day because of a pulled leg muscle and as a result did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> to bat on a wet wicket. He was able to rest on the Sunday and when play resumed on the Monday he lowered himself down the batting order and came out in the afternoon, when [...] "He limped as if in extreme pain, and several times lay on the ground as if ill", On the Tuesday he gave [...] "an amazing exhibition in amassing 234 runs - that is, amazing for one who was supposed to be a cripple. He played all the shots, pulled leg muscle and all, and often ran between the wickets with the speed of an Olympic sprinter". After the series ended Barnes gave a radio interview and freely admitted that he had [...] "kept on appealing until the umpires answered me" [...] simply because he thought the wicket was bad.|$|E

40|$|In {{this essay}} I address the popular notion that reading {{literature}} {{is a way}} to gain empathy through identification. Using the relatively new phenomenon of the lesbian mother as an example, I ask through which cultural repertoires lesbian mothers are made visible, which subject positions are available for them, and which identificatory positions are made available to readers. I explore a number of representations of lesbian mothers from comics, TV-series, films and Dutch children’s books. Depending on whether the lesbian mother is initially presented as a lesbian or as a mother, and depending on the context, a different coming out process is at stake: either she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> as a(n aspiring) mother; or she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> as a lesbian...|$|R

It is a wonderful thing to see, and shows that they are all insane. In fact, it is a country which is full of the most interesting superstitions.|$|E
