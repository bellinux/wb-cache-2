40|$|Men {{sometimes}} <b>insult</b> their intimate {{partners and}} these <b>insults</b> predict intimate partner violence. No research has investigated {{the function of}} men’s partner-directed <b>insults.</b> We hypothesize that men’s partner-directed <b>insults</b> are designed to retain their long-term mate and, therefore, that men’s use of partner-directed <b>insults</b> will covary with other mate retention behaviors. Using the mate retention inventory and the partner-directed <b>insults</b> scale, we conducted two studies to test this hypothesis. Study 1 included 245 men who reported their mate retention behaviors and partner-directed <b>insults.</b> Correlations and multiple regression analyses documented the predicted relationships between men’s partner-directed <b>insults</b> and mate retention behaviors. Study 2 included 372 women who reported their partner’s mate retention behaviors and <b>insults</b> that their partner-directed at them. The results replicated the results of Study 1. Discussion highlights future directions for investigating the relationships between men’s partner-directed <b>insults</b> and mate retention behaviors...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} {{research}} we {{examined the effects of}} bodily experience on processing of <b>insults</b> in a series of semantic categorization tasks we call <b>insult</b> detection tasks (i. e., participants decided whether presented stimuli were <b>insults</b> or not). Two types of <b>insults</b> were used: more embodied <b>insults</b> (e. g., asswipe, ugly), and less embodied <b>insults</b> (e. g., cheapskate, twit), as well as non-insults. In Experiments 1 and 2 the non-insults did not form a single, coherent category (e. g., airbase, polka), whereas in Experiment 3 all the non-insults were compliments (e. g., eyeful, honest). Regardless of type of non-insult used, we observed facilitatory embodied <b>insult</b> effects such that more embodied <b>insults</b> were responded to faster and recalled more often than less embodied <b>insults.</b> In Experiment 4 we used a larger set of <b>insults</b> as stimuli, which allowed hierarchical multiple regression analyses. These analyses revealed that bodily experience ratings accounted for a significant amount of unique response latency, response error, and recall variability for responses to <b>insults,</b> even with several other predictor variables (e. g., frequency, offensiveness, imageability) included in the analyses: responses were faster and more accurate, and there was greater recall for relatively more embodied <b>insults.</b> These results demonstrate that conceptual knowledge of <b>insults</b> is grounded in knowledge gained through bodily experience...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to examine whether knowledge gained through bodily experience influences the processing of <b>insults.</b> I presented embodied <b>insults</b> (e. g., asswipe'), non-embodied <b>insults</b> (e. g., cheapskate'), and other non-insults (e. g., armband') or compliments (e. g., eyeful') in four <b>insult</b> detection task experiments (is the stimulus an <b>insult</b> or not?'). After each experiment, participants were given a surprise recall task. In all four experiments, a facilitatory bodily experience effect was observed, such that the embodied <b>insults</b> were responded to more rapidly and were recalled more often than the non-embodied <b>insults.</b> I propose that knowledge gained through bodily experience is an integral component of the conceptual knowledge people possess for <b>insults.</b> My results are also consistent with the idea that embodied <b>insults</b> are understood by creating mental simulations of underlying bodily experiences.

Angry at her mother for ruining her chance at having a normal boyfriend, Meg threatens Lois to lay off of him, pulling out one of her own teeth in frustration. Lois quickly agrees, but is still angry with Peter for continually <b>insulting</b> her.

40|$|Background and Purpose: To {{clarify the}} role of {{elevated}} extracellular amino acid concentrations during ischemia on the cumulative neuronal damage after repeated cerebral ischemic <b>insults,</b> using a microdi-alysis technique we measured concentrations of the amino acids glutamate, glutamine, glycine, taurine, and y-aminobutyric acid in the gerbil hippocampus over three 2 -minute forebrain ischemic <b>insults</b> induced at 1 -hour intervals. Methods: Under light anesthesia, the bilateral common carotid arteries were occluded with aneurysm clips at 1 -hour intervals. Samples were collected by microdialysis at 10 -minute intervals, and the amino acid concentrations were determined using a high-performance liquid chromatography system. Results: During and immediately after the first ischemic <b>insult,</b> concentrations of glutamate, glycine, and taurine, but not glutamine, increased significantly. Glutamate and taurine concentrations rose again during {{the second and third}} ischemic <b>insults,</b> but the increases were smaller than those during the first <b>insult.</b> By contrast, glutamine concentrations increased slightly but significantly during the second and third ischemic <b>insults.</b> The extracellular concentration of y-aminobutyric acid before the ischemic <b>insults</b> was below the level of detectability but increased markedly during each ischemic <b>insult,</b> with similar declines in the amounts released during later <b>insults.</b> Concentrations of all amino acids returned t...|$|R
50|$|The iniuria {{need not}} be {{directly}} to the person aggrieved; it is plain that A might be <b>insulted</b> by something done to B. But the important cases of this are of outrage {{to members of the}} family. An iniuria to a wife gave an action not only to her but to her husband. An <b>insult</b> to a filiusfamilias was an <b>insult</b> to the paterfamilias as well, who might sue for himself and for his son, though, as in certain circumstances the son might himself sue, there was a provision against two actions nomine filii. Thus where a married daughter of the family was <b>insulted</b> there might be three actions, or more, her own, her husband's, her father's, and even her husband's father's. A sponsus might have an action on an <b>insult</b> to his sponsa, and there were other cases. It must be noted that the damages would not necessarily be the same in these cases: in each the personality of the plaintiff was considered. And though an <b>insult</b> to wife or child was an <b>insult</b> to paterfamilias, the converse was not true. The most remarkable case of indirect <b>insult</b> is that of heredes. An <b>insult</b> to the body or funeral was an <b>insult</b> to the heres if it was the heres had entered into the estate. If not, it was an <b>insult</b> to the hereditas and the heres after entry acquired it like other claims of the hereditas.|$|R
