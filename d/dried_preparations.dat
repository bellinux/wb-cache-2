The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the feasibility of a <b>dry</b> bowel <b>preparation,</b> i. e. without laxative fluids, for virtual CT colonography (VCTC), and its impact on patient acceptance compared with conventional colonoscopy (CC). A randomly chosen patient population scheduled for CC (n= 11) was first submitted to VCTC after a <b>dry</b> <b>preparation,</b> consisting of low-residue meals combined with a small amount of a iodinated water-soluble contrast medium during each meal 3 days before VCTC.

Two additional experiments were conducted to determine the immediately soluble DM and CP fractions released on mastication by the lactating cow, and these were compared with in sacco estimates.

In two African villages which differed in the level at which mosquitoes transmit the disease (1 and 100 infective bites per year and per individual), both the prevalence by age group and the levels of anti-sporozoite antibodies differed markedly, as follows. In the low-transmission area, these antibodies were not detected in subjects aged 2 to 10 years; thereafter, prevalence increased gradually with the age of the subject and reached 90 % in subjects aged 50 to 80 years. In the high-transmission area, all of the subjects studied, including the younger ones, were positive. Anti-sporozoite antibody levels were independent of the levels of antibodies directed against blood stages. On average, the mean antibody titers were equal to 1 / 16 in the first village and 1 / 1, 650 in the second one. These results suggest that stage-specific antibodies reflect the cumulative number of sporozoites inoculated in humans by mosquitoes and may therefore have useful epidemiological applications. In addition, the presence of stage-specific antibodies in the sera of African adults collected at different times after departure from the endemic area indicates that they may last for several years. During the course of this study, we observed a heterogeneity of immunofluorescence labeling in parasite populations prepared from mosquito salivary glands.

40|$|Dried and wet mouse {{fibroblast}} monolayers with labeled collagenous substrate {{were used}} to {{study the effects of}} lipoteichoic acid (LTA) on cellular prolyl hydroxylase activity. LTA is a scavenger of cations, and Fe 2 + is essential for prolyl hydroxylase activity. Surprisingly, addition of LTA to dried monolayers resulted in increased prolyl hydroxylase activity, whereas preincubation of Fe 2 + with LTA only negated this increase. However, significant inhibition of enzyme activity by wet monolayers occurred whether LTA was added directly to the test system or whether it was used after preincubation with Fe 2 +. These data suggest that LTA causes membrane perturbations. Also, that the binding of LTA to the membrane of dried and wet monolayers appears to be decidedly different when based on the subsequent availability of Fe 2 + for cellular prolyl hydroxylase activity. The ability of LTA to act as a cationic exchanger and the presence of intracellular Fe 2 + inaccessible to LTA probably accounted for the lack of complete inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase activity by this amphiphile in the wet cell system. Considerably less iron was needed to negate the partial inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase activity by LTA in viable cells than was needed to restore the increased enzyme activity by this amphiphile in equivalent <b>dried</b> <b>preparations.</b> These and other results showed that, although LTA does not affect collagen polypeptide chain formation in wet monolayers, its involvement at the molecular level does result in a marked decrease in the hydroxylation of collagenous peptidyl prolyl residues through LTA interaction with Fe 2 +. This reduction in prolyl hydroxylase activity equaled the reduction in hydroxylation of collagenous protein in fibroblast monolayers caused by LTA reported earlier (O. Leon and C. Panos, Infect. Immun. 40 : 785 - 794, 1983). Therefore, these data suggest that partial inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase activity {{is directly related to the}} synthesis of defective collagen by wet fibroblast monolayers exposed to minute amounts of group A, type 12 streptococcal LTA. Use of LTA also showed that complete inhibition of hydroxyproline formation is not required for the continued formation and accumulation of defective collagenous protein by these monolayers...|$|E

Since these effects could conceivably {{be due to the}} presence of small amounts of water in the <b>dry</b> <b>preparations</b> of sugar and lipid, we have done careful measurements of the residual water contents in the dry samples and report the results here. Lyophilized liposomes composed of palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine (9 : 1) contain at most 0. 2 mol of H 2 O per mol of lipid. When the trehalose concentration in the dry mixtures is increased, there is no increase in the apparent water content of the samples over a wide range of sugar concentrations. Over the same range of trehalose contents the maximal effect of trehalose on physical properties of the lipids and on stabilization of liposomes is achieved.
