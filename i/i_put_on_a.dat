500|$|The {{album cover}} {{features}} {{a photograph of}} Dylan with Suze Rotolo. It was taken in February 1963—a few weeks after Rotolo had returned from Italy—by CBS staff photographer Don Hunstein {{at the corner of}} Jones Street and West 4th Street in the West Village, New York City, close to the apartment where the couple lived at the time. In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: [...] "He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat." [...] In her memoir, A Freewheelin' Time, Rotolo analyzed the significance of the cover art: ...|$|E
2500|$|Liberace once stated, [...] "I don't give concerts, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> show." [...] Unlike {{the concerts}} of {{classical}} pianists which normally ended with applause and a retreat off-stage, Liberace's shows {{ended with the}} public invited on-stage to touch his clothes, piano, jewelry, and hands. Kisses, handshakes, hugs, and caresses usually followed. A critic summed up his appeal {{near the end of}} Liberace's life: [...] "Mr. Showmanship has another more potent, drawing power to his show: the warm and wonderful way he works his audience. Surprisingly enough, behind all the glitz glitter, the corny false modesty, and the shy smile, Liberace exudes a love that is returned to him a thousand-fold." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sheehan is {{best remembered}} as a novelist; in his novel My New Curate, he recounts an {{incident}} of a clerical appointment {{that may well be}} autobiographical and refer to his arrival in Doneraile: [...] "The Bishop sent for me and said, with what I would call a tone of pity or contempt, but he was incapable of either, for he was the essence of charity and sincerity: 'Father Dan, you are a bit of a literateur, I understand. Kilronan is vacant. You'll have plenty of time for poetising and dreaming there. [...] What do you say to it?' <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> little dignity, and though my heart was beating with delight, I quietly thanked his Lordship. [...] But, when I had passed beyond the reach of episcopal vision, which is far stretching enough, I spun my hat in the air, and shouted like a schoolboy: 'Hurrah!'".|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will have}} my bond, sir, or nothing," [...] I said; and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> {{attitude}} of resolution which I confess surprised even myself.|$|R
6000|$|I fancy this gloomy ramble {{is caused}} by a twinge of age; <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> under-shirt {{yesterday}} (it was the only one I could find) that barely came under my trousers; and just below it, a fine healthy rheumatism has now settled like a fire in my hip. From such small causes do these valuable considerations flow! ...|$|R
6000|$|I stood up, but was confounded with {{a sudden}} inquiry in my {{thoughts}} how I should receive him, and with a resolution as swift as lightning, in answer to it, said to myself, [...] "It shall be coldly." [...] So <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sudden <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> air of stiffness and ceremony, and held it for about two minutes; but it was with great difficulty.|$|R
60|$|At last {{he reached}} {{the head of the}} rapid. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> heavy strain. The rod bent like a hoop and finally began to crack, so I was {{compelled}} to let him go.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good morning, Russ," [...] said Miss Sampson and {{she gazed}} searchingly at me. I had {{dropped off the}} fence, sombrero in hand. I knew I was in for a lecture, and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> brazen, {{innocent}} air.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I flung off my nightgown and cap; <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> coarse {{unwashed}} shirt, a worn frock without waistcoat, an old round hat; {{these things}} I had sent for, some days ago, in {{the fear of}} what might happen.|$|E
50|$|Help! It's Parents Day At DSA - Some of the Class <b>I</b> Lads <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{play for}} their parents.|$|R
60|$|We had {{a dreadful}} {{experience}} last night. In {{the middle of}} the night Uncle Henry came and called me and said that Uncle William was ill. So <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> old shawl and went with him. The ship was pitching and heaving with a dreadful straining and creaking noise. A dim light burned in the cabin, and outside there was a great roaring of the wind and the wild sound of the sea surging against the ship.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> ulster, lit a cigar, {{and went}} up on deck. I found my chair on the {{sheltered}} side of the ship, and wrapping myself in a rug, prepared to spend a comfortable half-hour. But I had scarcely settled down before a little group of people came along the deck and halted close to me. A smooth-faced manservant, laden {{with a pile of}} magnificent rugs, struck a match and began to examine the labels on the chairs. Its flickering light was apparently sufficient for Adèle to recognize my features.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Hawk, I was silly. I felt I {{was such}} an {{independent}} modern woman a-a-and I aren't! I've always said it was silly for girls to swim in a woman's bathing-suit. Skirts are so cumbersome. So <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> boy's bathing-suit under my dress--and--I'm terribly embarrassed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So, along {{about ten}} o'clock, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wheedling smile {{and says to}} Miss Willella: 'Now, if there's {{anything}} I do like better than {{the sight of a}} red steer on green grass it's the taste of a nice hot pancake smothered in sugar-house molasses.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pretty well, pretty well,' replied Bob Sawyer. 'I PASSED, {{soon after}} that {{precious}} party, and my friends came down with the needful for this business; so <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> black suit of clothes, {{and a pair of}} spectacles, and came here to look as solemn as I could.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Sarolta. [...] Wait then, [...] Till thou hast learnt it! Fervent {{good old}} man! [...] 145 [...] Forgive me that, to try thee, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> [...] <b>A</b> face of sternness, alien to my meaning! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, father, suppose I do {{not start}} until it gets dark, then I can get home without {{attracting}} notice. There <b>I</b> can <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> suit {{of my old}} clothes, and bring my uniform out in my valise." ...|$|R
5000|$|... I'm off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered. <b>I</b> never <b>put</b> {{anything}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> horse.|$|R
60|$|One {{night when}} Margaret {{had gone up}} to her room, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> light overcoat, {{went out into the}} night and prowled for a long time through the narrow streets, smoking and thinking. I {{returned}} and went and {{sat on the edge of}} her bed to talk to her.|$|E
6000|$|I {{love this}} powder. It plays no tricks with you. Once <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> new powder that I bought in Paris, {{and as soon}} as I went into {{artificial}} light it turned a bright mauve. I was very much annoyed. You wouldn't like to go about with a mauve face, would you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Welcome, ladies," [...] he said, {{holding out}} a big, hard, but {{scrupulously}} clean hand. [...] "I thought you'd be feeling a bit tired and hungry, maybe, so when I came over to open up <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> fire and brewed you up a cup of tea. I just delight in being neighbourly and 'tain't often I have the chance." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{understood}} his allusion to my feet. I glanced {{down and saw}} that in my hurry <b>I</b> had <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pair of his old india-rubbers. My feet were not small or pretty, and the addition did not add to their beauty.|$|R
6000|$|... "One day a calf that we had, died. That night I broke its bones, dumped it into {{a coarse}} sack and tied it up with wire. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> old shirt, tore a sleeve 'most out of it, and the collar half off, tangled up my hair, put some red ink {{on my hands and}} spashed some of it over my shirt and face. I must have looked like I'd been having the fight of my life. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> the sack in a wagon and drove out to George's cabin. When I halloed, he came out in a yellow dressing-gown, a Turkish cap and patent leather shoes. George always was a great dresser.|$|R
50|$|In a Turkish-occupied Greek village {{shortly after}} World War <b>I,</b> villagers <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Passion Play, with {{ordinary}} people taking {{the roles of}} Jesus, Peter, Judas, etc. Staging the play leads to them rebelling against their Turkish rulers {{in a way that}} mirrors Jesus's story.|$|R
60|$|Set. Why, {{that was}} it, madam; {{according}} to your order, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> disguise, and found him in the Temple-walks: Having drawn him aside, I told him, if he expected happiness, he must meet me in a blind alley, I nam'd to him, {{on the back side}} of Mr Trice's house, just at the close of evening; there he should be satisfied from whom he had his supplies of money.|$|E
60|$|Taking a key whereof I {{knew the}} repository, I mounted three {{staircases}} in succession, reached a dark, narrow, silent landing, opened a worm-eaten door, and dived into the deep, black, cold garret. Here none would follow me--none interrupt--not Madame herself. I shut the garret-door; I placed my {{light on a}} doddered and mouldy chest of drawers; <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> shawl, for the air was ice-cold; I took my letter; trembling with sweet impatience, I broke its seal.|$|E
60|$|One morning I {{had gone}} off to fish by myself, with a Norwegian youth to gaff and carry the fish. Coming {{to a sort of}} weir, with a deep pool above and a riotous rapid below, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> salmon fly and cast into the pool. At once a fish rose and was hooked. It was not a big one--only 12 pounds or thereabouts--but quite big enough to break rod and line if not played respectfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, Austin, I do {{not know}} what is the matter with you this morning. One would almost think that you doubted my word. If my boots are dusty, it must be, of course, that <b>I</b> have <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pair which the maid had not cleaned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Brooks flood. Then {{you must}} shift your sheep--let alone {{foot-rot}} afterward. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> more dependence <b>on</b> <b>a</b> dew-pond any day.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Monsieur Kennedy," [...] he said, {{after the}} {{ceremony}} of presentation had been completed; [...] "I wish that I had all my faithful subjects, of the Irish Brigade, across the water with me; and that <b>I</b> could <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> uniform like yours, and fight at their head for my rights." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} {{everybody}} {{was up and}} dressing. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> light Norfolk jacket over my mail shirt {{in order to have}} a pocket handy to hold my cartridges, and buckled on my revolver. Good did the same, but Sir Henry put on nothing except his mail shirt, steel-lined cap, and a pair of 'veldt-schoons' or soft hide shoes, his legs being bare from the knees down. His revolver he strapped on round his middle outside the armoured shirt.|$|E
6000|$|But, to return. When I {{drew near}} to the fort, I {{observed}} that several black specks were gliding with lightning speed down the white track on the hillside which Lumley had undertaken to finish. These specks, after descending the steep hill, slid over the level shore and shot far out upon the lake, where some {{of them seemed to}} roll over and over. Wondering what this could be, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> spurt. Suddenly the truth dawned upon me. My friend Lumley had cleared the slope for the purpose of sledging down it! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> little steam. Sure enough, {{round the}} corner I caught sight of his back. With a spurt, I passed him--a dust-covered soul, very hot and uncomfortable. He had not kept his wind; I flew past him like a whirlwind. But, oh, how sultry hot in that sweltering, close valley! A pretty little town, Eppstein, with its mediæval castle perched high on a craggy rock. I owed it some gratitude, I felt, as I left it behind, for 'twas here that I {{came up with the}} {{tail-end}} of my opponents.|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't do it! I can't do it! I'll be hanged if I'll do it! How {{on earth}} can I dress up like that? Do {{you realize that}} most days I don't {{get out of my}} pyjamas till five in the afternoon, and then <b>I</b> just <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> old sweater?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all! People call me {{a strange}} girl, and I {{might as well have}} the comfort of it. I came to take a walk; that, by the way, is part of my strangeness. I can't loll all the morning <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sofa, and all the {{afternoon}} in a carriage. I get horribly restless. I must move; I must do something and see something. Mamma suggests a cup of tea. Meanwhile <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> old dress and half a dozen veils, I take Assunta under my arm, and we start <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pedestrian tour. It 's a bore that I can't take the poodle, but he attracts attention. We trudge about everywhere; there is nothing I like so much. I hope you will congratulate me on the simplicity of my tastes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very true, sir, and I {{hope your}} future success {{will be in}} {{proportion}} to the lateness of your appearance at the bar. Your companion has much more the air of a sailor than of a lawyer."--This was true enough, there being no mistaking Marble's character, though <b>I</b> had <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> body-coat to come ashore in;--"I presume he is not in the practice." ...|$|R
