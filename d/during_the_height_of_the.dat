5|$|Bouvet capsized {{and sank}} {{in about two}} minutes.

5|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the coins (e.g. {{providing}} kings' names), they have proved essential in constructing a chronology of the Kings of Aksum. An estimated 98 percent of the city of Aksum remains unexcavated, and other areas even more so. Through analysis of the number of coins produced and the style of coins, archaeologists have been able to construct a rough chronology, generally agreed upon until the late 6th- and 7th-century kings. Of the 20 Aksumite Kings attested by their coins, inscriptions corroborate the existence of only two, who happen to be the most famous kings: Ezana and Kaleb, both of whose reigns were periods of exceptional prosperity <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aksumite kingdom.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> typhoon at Cabras Island on Guam, a {{gasoline}} tank caught fire, {{believed to be}} from friction caused by extremely high winds running through its ventilation system. The tank exploded, sending its lid airborne and spreading the fire to other nearby tanks. The proximity of the tanks as well as low water pressure hampered firefighting efforts, and the fire was extinguished five days later; it resulted in three destroyed gasoline tanks with two more caught on fire. While the fire was burning, transportation of gasoline from the port {{to the rest of}} Guam was suspended resulting in a halt in gasoline sales for the general public.|$|E
