5|$|The {{first and}} largest glacier was the Sherwin or Pre-Tahoe glacier, which eroded the upper Merced {{watershed}} {{to an extent}} close to its present form. Three stages followed during the Wisconsinian glaciation; these were the Tahoe, Tenaya and Tioga stages, of which the Tioga was the smallest. The Tioga glacier left {{at the mouth of}} Yosemite Valley a rocky moraine. This moraine was actually one of several moraines deposited by the four glaciations, which include Medial Moraine and Bridalveil Moraine. After the Tioga Glacier retreated this moraine formed a lake that flooded nearly the entire valley. Gradual sedimentation filled Lake Yosemite, creating a broad and flat valley floor. Sediments of glacial origin continued to travel down the Merced River following then, helping to form the <b>flat</b> <b>floor</b> of the Central Valley.|$|E

25|$|The {{significant}} asymmetry in {{distribution of}} the impact ejecta indicates that Lofn was formed by an oblique impact. The impactor probably came from the north-west. The shallowness of the crater {{may be related to}} the fragmentation of the impactor prior to the contact with the surface. A cluster of fragments is generally less efficient in excavation of the surface material than a single body. Another reason for the <b>flat</b> <b>floor</b> of Lofn is viscous relaxation of the crust after impact, which implies the existence of a layer of ductile material below the surface at the time of the impact. This soft material may be warm ice or even a subsurface ocean.|$|E
500|$|The river first {{formed as}} the Sierra Nevada rose about 10 million years ago, and {{sediment}} eroded from its canyon helped form the <b>flat</b> <b>floor</b> of the San Joaquin Valley. Glaciation during the Ice Ages carved the high elevation {{parts of the}} watershed, including Yosemite Valley, into their present shape. Historically, there was an extensive riparian zone which provided habitat for millions of migrating birds, and the river {{had one of the}} southernmost runs of chinook salmon in North America.|$|E

Entrance holes {{tend to be very}} small with only enough space for a single worker to fit through, but others may be [...] wide. Beneath the surface, there are widened circular vertical shafts which are [...] wide. Below these shafts, the tunnels turn into irregular galleries with paths going outward and downward which form more galleries. Almost all of these galleries are clustered together [...] beneath the soil, which is extensively reworked by worker ants in the area above the nest. These sets of galleries are isolated from others connecting to neighbouring holes, although some may come close. However, there is no known physical connection. Each gallery has a <b>flat</b> <b>floor,</b> a domed roof and is irregularly oval-shaped. A gallery is typically [...] high and [...] wide. Below the galleries are a small number of shafts in undisturbed soil with large, yet scattered chambers where the population remains during the winter.
