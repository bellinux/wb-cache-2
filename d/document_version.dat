50|$|Not {{long after}} NERC {{introduced}} the NERC Tag spreadsheet and packet emailer, NERC {{concluded that it}} did not want involvement in any future software development or maintenance. A NERC Tag specification <b>document,</b> <b>version</b> 1.4, was drafted as the next level in energy tagging, the NERC Tag would subsequently also be known as an E-Tag. Data transfer would now occur directly over an Internet connection instead of via e-mail. This eliminated the cumbersome process required to receive a data packet via email and port it back into the original spreadsheet-based tagging application. This change made the NERC Tag much easier to use in a real-time application. E-Tag 1.4 went into effect in 1999, but was replaced just nine months later with E-Tag 1.5, followed three months later with E-Tag 1.501. The 1.5 and 1.501 Specs corrected the shortcomings experienced with the initial release of the first E-Tag Spec.|$|E

40|$|Time-travel text search enriches {{standard}} text {{search by}} temporal predicates, so that users of web archives can easily retrieve <b>document</b> <b>versions</b> {{that are considered}} relevant to a given keyword query and existed during a given time interval. Different index structures have been proposed to effciently support time-travel text search. None of them, however, can easily be updated as the Web evolves and new <b>document</b> <b>versions</b> {{are added to the}} web archive. In this work, we describe a novel index structure that effciently supports time-travel text search and can be maintained incrementally as new <b>document</b> <b>versions</b> are added to the web archive. Our solution uses a sharded index organization, bounds the number of spuriously read index entries per shard, and can be maintained using small in-memory buffers and append-only operations. We present experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrating that maintaining our novel index structure is an order of magnitude more efficient than periodically rebuilding one of the existing index structures, while query-processing performance is not adversely affected...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the design and}} implementation of an adaptive <b>document</b> <b>version</b> management scheme.
