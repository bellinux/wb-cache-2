40|$|A new {{development}} in graphite fuel elements for high temperature reactors is {{the application of}} a silicon carbide coating.

The major part of this work deals with the development of a threedimensional diffusion code for cartesian, cylindrical and sperical geometry.

40|$|The {{formation}} of fission {{gases in the}} fuel during operation and their rate of release to the grain boundaries and hence to the plenum is a major feature that can limit the linear power rating of the fuel and the duration of a reactor’s continuous operation. Much {{attention has been given}} to investigating the mechanisms of fission gas accumulation in the fuel matrix and its gradual collection into bubbles, both within the grains and at grain boundaries and how to maximize its retention in the fuel matrix. Considerable work has been done at JRC-ITU and elsewhere looking at the mechanisms and irradiated fuel history effects on fission gas retention/release from the fuel. The current concern for commercial reactors is particularly about <b>fission</b> gas <b>behaviour</b> for MOX or high burn-up UO 2 under operating power transients. Gradual accumulation in the rod free volume would increase the internal rod pressure and may ultimately induce cladding rupture. In extreme cases, such as power transients or accident conditions, sudden fission gas release can result in multiple rods failure and release of fission gas and other volatile fission products to the primary water circuit, forcing reactor shut down.

40|$|The {{modelling}} of <b>fission</b> gas <b>behaviour</b> is {{a crucial}} aspect of nuclear fuel performance analysis {{in view of the}} related effects on the thermo-mechanical performance of the fuel rod, which can be particularly significant during transients. In particular, experimental observations indicate that substantial fission gas release (FGR) can occur on a small time scale during transients (burst release). To accurately reproduce the rapid kinetics of the burst release process in fuel performance calculations, a model that accounts for non-diffusional mechanisms such as fuel micro-cracking is needed. In this work, we present and assess a model for transient <b>fission</b> gas <b>behaviour</b> in oxide fuel, which is applied as an extension of conventional diffusion-based models to introduce the burst release effect. The concept and governing equations of the model are presented, and the sensitivity of results to the newly introduced parameters is evaluated through an analytic sensitivity analysis. The model is assessed for application to integral fuel rod analysis by implementation in two structurally different fuel performance codes: BISON (multi-dimensional finite element code) and TRANSURANUS (1. 5 D code). Model assessment is based on the analysis of 19 light water reactor fuel rod irradiation experiments from the OECD/NEA IFPE (International Fuel Performance Experiments) database, all of which are simulated with both codes. The results point out an improvement in both the quantitative predictions of integral fuel rod FGR and the qualitative representation of the FGR kinetics with the transient model relative to the canonical, purely diffusion-based models of the codes. The overall quantitative improvement of the integral FGR predictions in the two codes is comparable. Moreover, calculated radial profiles of xenon concentration after irradiation are investigated and compared to experimental data, illustrating the underlying representation of the physical mechanisms of burst release.

40|$|Experimental {{observations}} {{relative to}} both in-reactor irradiation and post-irradiation annealing of oxide nuclear fuel indicate that substantial fission gas release (FGR) can occur {{on a small}} time scale during temperature transients (burst release). The rapid kinetics of the process cannot be interpreted as purely diffusion-controlled. Micrographs demonstrate the presence of patterns of grain boundary separations (micro-cracks) in transient-tested fuel, thus indicating micro-cracking as the basic mechanism of burst release. Representing such effect {{is essential for the}} proper analysis of <b>fission</b> gas <b>behaviour</b> and of the multiple related aspects of fuel performance during reactor operational transients and design-basis accidents. Models employed in fuel performance codes typically allow for gas release only following extensive grain-boundary gas bubble interlinkage (ductile behaviour of the grain boundaries). In this work, a new model for transient <b>fission</b> gas <b>behaviour</b> in oxide fuel is developed, which introduces the alternative mechanism of gas release from the grain boundaries following micro-cracking (brittle behaviour). As a preliminary approach, a relatively simple, semi-empirical description is adopted. The treatment extends an existing model for diffusion-controlled fission gas release and swelling. The effect of micro-cracking is interpreted as a reduction of the gas storing capacity of grain boundaries during transients, effectively leading to an increase of FGR and to a corresponding decrease of fission gas swelling. The fraction of cracked grain surface is described by a temperature-dependent sigmoid function, which reproduces the characteristics of transient gas release observed experimentally both during increasing as well as decreasing temperatures. Relative to existing transient release models, no discrete temperature threshold for burst release activation is involved, thus guaranteeing continuity of the calculated fission gas concentrations in both time and space. Thus, the model is compatible with a physically sound description of the coupled fission gas release and swelling. The model is implemented in the BISON fuel performance code and applied to the simulation of fuel rod irradiation experiments involving transients. The results are presented, pointing out an encouraging predictive accuracy and a consistent representation of the experimentally observed kinetics of FGR during transients. JRC.

This restructuring can influence the fuel performance including, e. g. <b>fission</b> gas release <b>behaviour,</b> temperature, hardness and density. In order to clarify the threshold burnup and temperature of rim structure formation and fuel performances of LWR UO 2 fuels and gadolinia-doped ((U,Gd) O 2) fuels whose usage is increasing for higher burnup in LWR, several post irradiation examinations such as scanning electron microscope (SEM) /transmission electron microscope (TEM) observation, density measurements, hot cell annealing and thermal diffusivity measurements are done.

40|$|The {{fission product}} {{releases}} from spherical fuel elements used in modern high temperature gas cooled reactors {{are one of}} the first source terms used in describing the safety of planned nuclear plants during normal and accident conditions. The verification and validation of the model and code used to predict the gaseous <b>fission</b> product <b>behaviour</b> and release from spherical fuel elements for the PBMR were documented in this dissertation. The PBMR is the latest design in high temperature gas cooled reactor technology utilizing spherical fuel elements based on the LEU TRISO-coated particle design. Fission products can be divided into relatively short-lived noble gas and halogens, and relatively long-lived metallic fission and activation products. Each group is described by its own models and sets of transport parameters. The noble gases and halogen fission product releases from the fuel elements are direct indications of fuel performance and are modelled by the Booth equation. The fission product release legacy code NOBLEG for noble gases and halogens was developed previously to calculate this diffusion model for high temperature reactors. The model and code are verified and validated for use in PBMR design and analyses under normal operating conditions. The history of irradiation experiments conducted on coated fuel particles and spherical fuel elements was investigated, and the most suitable irradiation tests with their post irradiation investigations were identified for the purpose of validation of the model and code. The model used to determine gaseous <b>fission</b> product <b>behaviour</b> and release from spherical fuel elements is described in detail. The application of this model in the code is verified mathematically with the Booth model, and by inspection of the source code. The thermohydraulic model used by NOBLEG to calculate fuel temperatures is verified with code to code comparisons with the core neutronics code VSOP.

40|$|The {{transport}} of fission gas {{from within the}} fuel grains to the grain boundaries (intra-granular fission gas release) is a fundamental controlling mechanism of fission gas release and gaseous swelling in nuclear fuel. Hence, accurate numerical solution of the corresponding mathematical problem needs {{to be included in}} <b>fission</b> gas <b>behaviour</b> models used in fuel performance codes. Under the assumption of equilibrium between trapping and resolution, the process can be described mathematically by a single diffusion equation for the gas atom concentration in a grain. In this paper, we propose a new numerical algorithm (PolyPole- 1) to efficiently solve the fission gas diffusion equation in time-varying conditions. The PolyPole- 1 algorithm is based on the analytic modal solution of the diffusion equation for constant conditions, combined with polynomial corrective terms that embody the information on the deviation from constant conditions. The new algorithm is verified by comparing the results to a finite difference solution over a large number of randomly generated operation histories. Furthermore, comparison to state-of-the-art algorithms used in fuel performance codes demonstrates that the accuracy of PolyPole- 1 is superior to other algorithms, with similar computational effort. Finally, the concept of PolyPole- 1 may be extended to the solution of the general problem of intra-granular fission gas diffusion during non-equilibrium trapping and resolution, which will be the subject of future work.

40|$|Uranium and {{plutonium}} oxides {{are subjected}} {{to high levels of}} radiation damage due to the slowing of fission fragments. In addition the composition of the material evolves over time as a result of fission events. Rare gases which constitute an abundant class of fission products are particularly insoluble and therefore tend either to be released from the fuel or form small nanometre size clusters. Bubbles are liable to grow and become trapping sites for migrating defects or other insoluble atoms. Interactions between migrating atoms, defects and existing clusters will determine the rate and extent to which clusters grow. Because the transfer of gas from within the grain to the grain boundaries is thought of as being the rate limiting process for fission gas release, a review of phenomena occurring on the sub-grain scale is carried out. The microstructural modifications induced by neutron irradiations of UO 2 fuels are discussed with an emphasis on their relation to fission gas release.

Fission {{product release}} from spherical fuel spheres under {{different}} irradiation and heat-up conditions {{is one of}} the key criteria used in High Temperature Reactor (HTR) design. Accurate analyses of fuel performance and <b>fission</b> product <b>behaviour</b> is therefore essential in justifying the safe behaviour of the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR). GETTER proved to be a very versatile tool for evaluating fission product transport problems; ranging from heating experiments (up to 1 800 °C) to full core analyses under operating and accident conditions. GETTER includes subroutines, which calculate the burn-up and power history of a fuel sphere in the core, and the temperature distribution in the sphere based on given neutron cross-sections and gas temperatures. These values are then used to determine fission product inventories in the fuel materials. Transport through the coating layers of TRISO-particles, graphitic matrix material, and into the coolant gas are based on Ficks' laws of diffusion and evaporative mass transfer. A description is given of the physical laws and correlations used by GETTER to simulate fission product, activation product, or heavy metal migration in spherical HTR fuel elements.

40|$|The {{substantial}} {{release of}} fission gas during temperature transients (burst release) can be critical during operational reactor transients and (design-basis) accidents. A purely diffusion-based model cannot explain the rapid kinetics of the process. In this work, {{we present a}} model for transient fission gas release in oxide fuel. This model arises from experimental observations relative to both in-reactor irradiation and post-irradiation annealing of UO 2 fuel. In particular, micrographs demonstrate the presence of grain-face separations (micro-cracks) in transient-tested fuel, thus indicating that a basic mechanism of burst release is micro-cracking. The presented model extends a previously developed diffusion-based model, introducing the effect of micro-cracking. This is interpreted as a reduction of the grain-face gas inventory and storing capacity during transients. The process is modelled through an empirical temperature-dependent function based on the experimentally observed characteristics of gas release during both heating and cooling transients. The model also includes an irradiation-induced micro-crack healing process, which gradually restores the original grain-face gas storing capacity. This process is described {{by means of an}} empirical burnup-dependent function. The resulting extended model (diffusion-based <b>fission</b> gas <b>behaviour</b> together with transient release) is overall semi-empirical, but the burst release capability notably preserves the continuity in time and space as well as the consistent coupling of the calculated fission gas release and swelling. The new model was originally implemented in the fuel performance code BISON.

The tests cover fuel rod degradation and the <b>behaviour</b> of <b>fission</b> products released via the primary coolant circuit into the containment building. The results of the first two tests, called FPT 0 and FPT 1, carried out under low pressure, in a steam rich atmosphere and using fresh fuel for FPT 0 and fuel burned in a reactor at 23 GWdt− 1 for FPT 1, were immensely challenging, especially with regard to the iodine radiochemistry. Some of the most important observed phenomena with regard to the chemistry of iodine were indeed neither predicted nor pre-calculated, which clearly shows the interest and the need for carrying out integral experiments to study the complex phenomena governing <b>fission</b> product <b>behaviour</b> in a PWR in accident conditions. The three most unexpected results in the iodine behaviour related to early detection during fuel degradation of a weak but significant fraction of volatile iodine in the containment, the key role played by silver rapidly binding iodine to form insoluble AgI in the containment sump and the importance of painted surfaces in the containment atmosphere for the formation of a large quantity of volatile organic iodides. To support the Phebus test interpretation small-scale analytical experiments and computer code analyses were carried out. The former, helping towards a better understanding of overall iodine behaviour, were used to develop or improve models while the latter mainly aimed at identifying relevant key phenomena and at modelling weaknesses. Specific efforts were devoted to exploring the potential origins of the early-detected volatile iodine in the containment building. If a clear explanation has not yet been found, the non-equilibrium chemical processes favoured in the primary coolant circuit and the early radiolytic oxidation of iodides in the condensed water films are at present the most likely explanations. Models that were modified or developed and embodied in the computer codes for organic iodide formation/destruction in the gas phase and Ag–I reactions in the sump lead, in agreement with the Phebus findings respectively to greatly enhanced organic iodide formation kinetics and long term concentration in the containment atmosphere on one hand and, in the conditions of Phebus experiments, to significantly limited molecular iodine volatilisation from the sump in so far as silver was in excess compared to iodine, on the other hand. Organic iodides then quickly gain in importance and become the predominant volatile iodine species at long term. JRC. F. 4 -Nuclear design safet...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Modelling <b>fission</b> product (FP) <b>behaviour</b> during severe light-water reactor {{accidents}} {{covers a}} considerable diversity of phenomena such as solid-state diffusion, high temperature chemistry, aerosol physics and radioiodine chemistry. Over {{a number of}} years IPSN developed computer codes for modelling FP behaviour where, now, improved versions of these are included in the integral code ASTEC, jointly developed by GRS and IPSN. Whereas ASTEC models a whole accident sequence, this paper describes just its FP modules: ELSA for release from the core, SOPHAEROS for radionuclide transport in the reactor coolant system and IODE for radioiodine behaviour in the containment building. The approaches used aim to provide reliable indications of FP behaviour without excessive calculation times. This said, the degree to which modelling is simplified to render calculations faster must be compatible with the level of confidence required in the predictions. Based on results of validation campaigns of the FP models in ASTEC V 0 and in the context of needs arising from analyses for probabilistic safety assessments, further essential modelling improvements are being made for integration in ASTEC V 1. Recent enhancement of ELSA has improved prediction of semi-volatile FP (e. g., Ba, Sr, Mo, etc.) release from solid fuel and included release models for degraded-core geometries and control rod materials. Enhancement of SOPHAEROS concerns improved numerical efficiency, addition of a new, comprehensive thermochemistry database and inclusion of a pool scrubbing module. As for IODE, developments focus on the formation of organic iodine due to paints and gas-phase destruction mechanisms of organic iodides. Beyond the above developments, principal areas are identified where improvements are still required...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the scope}} of the 5 th EURATOM Framework Programme (FP) for the HTR-F and HTR-F 1 projects, a new 4 -year {{integrated}} project on very high temperature reactors (RAPHAEL: ReActor for Process Heat And Electricity) was started in April 2006 as part of the 6 th framework Programme. The Sub-Project on Fuel Technology (SP-FT) is one of eight sub-projects constituting the RAPHAEL project. R&D conducted in this sub-project focuses on understanding fuel behaviour, determining the limits of state-of-the-art fuel,and developing potential performance improvements. Fabrication processes were worked out for alternative fuel kernel composition (UCO instead of UO 2) and coating (ZrC instead of SiC) : i) UCO microstructure reduces fission product migration and is thus considered superior to UO 2 under high burn-ups and high temperature gradients. For this reason, the manufacturing feasibility of UCO kernels using modified external sol-gel routes was addressed. The calcining and sintering steps were particularly studied. ii) For its better high temperature performance, ZrC is a candidate coating material for replacing SiC in TRISO (TRistructural ISOtropic) particles. One of the objectives was therefore to deposit a stoichiometric ZrC layer without impurities. An ¿analytical irradiation¿ experiment currently performed in the HFR ¿ named PYCASSO for PYrocarbon irradiation for Creep And Swelling/Shrinkage of Objects ¿ was set up to measure the changes in coating material properties as a function of neutron fluence, with samples coming from the new fabrication process. This experiment was started in April 2008 and will provide data on particle component behaviour under irradiation. This data is required to upgrade material models implemented in the ATLAS fuelsimulation code. The PYCASSO irradiation experiment is a true Generation IV VHTR effort, with Korean and Japanese samples included in the irradiation 1. Further RAPHAEL results will be made available to the GIF VHTR Fuel and Fuel Cycle project partners in the future. Post-irradiation examinations and heat-up tests performed on fuel irradiated in an earlier project are being performed to investigate the behaviour of state-of-the-art fuel in VHTR normal and accident conditions. Very interesting results from destructive examinations performed on the HFREU 1 bis pebbles were obtained, showing a clear temperature (and high burn-up) influence on both kernel changes (including <b>fission</b> product <b>behaviour)</b> and the coating layers 2. Based on fuel particle models established earlier, the fuel modelling capabilities could be further improved: i) Modelling of fuel elements containing thousands of particles is expected to enable a statistical approach to mechanical particle <b>behaviour</b> and <b>fission</b> product release. ii) A database on historical and new fuel properties was built to enable validation of models; This paper reports on recent progress and main results of the RAPHAEL sub-project on fuel technology.

40|$|The {{uncontrolled}} {{release of}} radioactive fission {{products from the}} primary circuit of a nuclear power reactor, described as “release source term”, {{is one of the}} major criteria for assessing a severe nuclear accident. A large number of tests were carried out under the European Commission (EC) Framework Programmes to improve our understanding of the <b>fission</b> product <b>behaviour.</b> Especially the five integral pile tests that were carried out in the Phébus FP programme lead to an increased understanding of the mechanisms of severe accidents, but also emphasized the need of further separate effect tests to study some individual phenomena in more detail. One of these was the possibility of chemical revaporisation of fission products (especially 137 Cs) after their initial deposition inside the primary circuit or containment. This revaporisation can lead to a significant release in the late phase of a severe accident which was previously not taken into account when calculating the release source term. To study this behaviour using realistic samples of fission product deposits, which were obtained from the Phébus test circuit, a lead shielded revaporisation device was designed and set-up inside a glove box. In the device, a compact high temperature furnace is used to heat the samples under a controlled gas flow up to 1273 K with nearly ambient pressure. The gas flow is slow enough to prevent physical resuspension. It consists of hydrogen, steam, air or argon. An on-line gamma spectroscopy system is used to scrutinize the revaporisation behaviour by monitoring the loss of activity for the 137 Cs in the sample. In the most recent test sequence, consisting of 3 experiments, samples from the Phébus FPT 3 upper vertical line were heated with 2 K/min up to 1273 K under steam, hydrogen or air. The tests showed similar results for the two experiments under oxidising conditions (steam or air) were used as process gas. Revaporisation started for steam at ~ 810 K respectively for air at ~ 860 K and progressed for some time with a loss of activity equal to ~ 1 %/min. More than ~ 90 % of the 137 Cs had revaporised at the end of the experiment. The experiment using reducing conditions (pure hydrogen) showed diverse results. The revaporisation did not start before ~ 955 K and progressed with a slower loss of activity (~ 0. 7 %/min). The total amount of revaporisation was only 79 %, which was caused by a power outage which the system experienced before the planned heating sequence had finished. Nevertheless, the results show that revaporisation is possible and that a switch in the atmospheric conditions (reducing to oxidising) lowers the threshold temperature which is necessary to trigger revaporisation. For the last experiment a sampling method was introduced to determine the size and chemical composition of the aerosols that form after the process gas is cooled down. Analysis showed a large number of particles in the diameter range 8 - 20 nm and EDX revealed Cs, Re and Si to be their main components. JRC. E. 2 -Safety of Irradiated Nuclear Material...|$|R
