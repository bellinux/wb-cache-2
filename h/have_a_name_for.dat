500|$|In Meade's opinion, Mavis gave {{a name to}} and {{represented}} {{a certain type of}} woman: [...] "A 1940s spinster with a 1940s head who's looked 50 since birth. A Woman's Realm made flesh. And you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> her. She's a Mavis... Mavis Riley was a masterpiece of observation". His opinion was shared by Gerlinde Frey-Vor and Julia Hallam, who consider Mavis to be a [...] "model for a spinsterly type of woman". Brian Meade suggested that Barlow had [...] "honed a comic gem until it cut into the national consciousness" [...] in her characterisation of Mavis, likening her to other successful TV characters like Basil Fawlty, Del Boy Trotter and Alf Garnett. Meade applauded Barlow for staying true to Mavis's character for 26years, [...] "sustaining the most timid, world-weary of women with remarkable consistency. Try to recall her great lines and you are stumped. Every sentence she whimpered seemed to begin with 'Ooh Derek' and end with: 'Well, I don't really know, but he suggested that she had graced some of Coronation Street's [...] "finest scenes", pointing to Mavis and Rita's spoof of a Laurel and Hardy act as one example.|$|E

2500|$|Evidently Carthage {{also had}} an {{institution}} of elders who advised the Suffets, similar to the Roman Senate. [...] We do not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> this body.

[...] The institution had several hundred members from the wealthiest class who held office for life. [...] Vacancies were probably filled by co-option. [...] From among its members were selected the 104 Judges mentioned above. Later the 104 would come to judge not only army generals but other office holders as well. Aristotle regarded the 104 as most important; he compared it to the ephorate of Sparta with regard to control over security. In Hannibal's time, such a Judge held office for life. At some stage there also came to be independent self-perpetuating boards of five who filled vacancies and supervised (non-military) government administration.|$|E

2500|$|The Dillinger Escape Plan {{announced}} their departure from Relapse Records in 2009.

2500|$|This {{technique}} of separating the 3D image {{has been called}} a new shot in filmmaking, although it is partially comparable to shots in the first 3D feature film The Power of Love. Calum Marsh of The Dissolve said that [...] "the vocabulary of the cinema has been enriched. There is a new tool available to filmmakers: a new technique, like the jump cut before it", and that in his previous films Godard has [...] "been searching for a way to unify ideas—to join disparate images to create a new one. This shot is the realization." [...] Erin Whitney of The Huffington Post wrote that [...] "The moment is so innovative and unusual that Godard and his cinematographer, Fabrice Aragno, didn't even <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> it (Aragno has referred to the shot as [...] "separation," [...] {{for lack of a better}} term)." [...] David Ehrlich of The Dissolve has described the technique as a [...] "choose your own adventure" [...] shot and wrote that [...] "by rendering the disparate images separate but simultaneous, Godard has found a way for viewers to compare separate images at the moment they see them. Goodbye To Language effectively argues that every cut is porous, and that seeing is just looking, if it's distracted by memory." [...] Amy Taubin of Film Comment called the shot [...] "a mindboggling, eyeball-dislocating, narratively profound sequence" [...] and reported that after the shot concluded the audience erupted into applause at the film's premiere during the Cannes film festival. Jonathan Romney of Film Comment said that [...] "it's in-camera magic of a Méliès vintage: a piece of cheap trickery, but brilliantly and simply carried off, finding hitherto unsuspected delight in a simple 'improper' use of 3-D." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{was a clear}} {{progression}} in his development, from {{an early}} concentration on tap and musical comedy style to greater complexity using ballet and modern dance forms. Kelly himself refused to categorize his style: [...] "I don't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> my style of dancing...It's certainly hybrid...I've borrowed from the modern dance, from the classical, and certainly from the American folk dance – tap-dancing, jitterbugging...But I have tried to develop a style which is indigenous to {{the environment in which}} I was reared." [...] He especially acknowledged the influence of George M. Cohan: [...] "I have a lot of Cohan in me. It's an Irish quality, a jaw-jutting, up-on-the-toes cockiness – which is a good quality for a male dancer to have." [...] He was also heavily influenced by an African-American dancer, Robert Dotson, whom he saw perform at Loew's Penn Theatre around 1929. He was briefly taught by Frank Harrington, an African-American tap specialist from New York. However, his main interest was in ballet, which he studied under Kotchetovsky in the early Thirties. As biographer Clive Hirschhorn explains: [...] "As a child he used to run for miles through parks and streets and woods – anywhere, just {{as long as he could}} feel the wind against his body and through his hair. Ballet gave him the same feeling of exhilaration, and in 1933 he was convinced it was the most satisfying form of self-expression." [...] He also studied Spanish dancing under Angel Cansino, Rita Hayworth's uncle. Generally speaking, he tended to use tap and other popular dance idioms to express joy and exuberance – as in the title song from Singin' in the Rain or [...] "I Got Rhythm" [...] from An American in Paris, whereas pensive or romantic feelings were more often expressed via ballet or modern dance, as in [...] "Heather on the Hill" [...] from Brigadoon or [...] "Our Love Is Here to Stay" [...] from An American in Paris.|$|E

60|$|The {{only things}} {{which we can}} observe {{directly}} being our own sensations, or other feelings, a complete descriptive language would be one in which {{there should be a}} name for every variety of elementary sensation or feeling. Combinations of sensations or feelings may always be described, if we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> each of the elementary feelings which compose them; but brevity of description, and clearness (which often depends very much on brevity), are greatly promoted by giving distinctive names not to the elements alone, but also to all combinations which are of frequent recurrence.

60|$|He {{looked up}} at her as she stood facing him in the lamplight before the fire, and was forced to admit to himself that the boast was not wholly idle. A smile was on her lips, her eyes gleamed with health; her furs--of silver fox--were thrown back, the crimson roses pinned on her mauve {{afternoon}} gown matched the glow in her cheeks, while her hair mingled with the dusky shadows.

Psychologists <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> such a phenomenon.

60|$|In like manner, a Sensation {{is to be}} {{carefully}} distinguished from the object which causes the sensation; our sensation of white from a white object: nor is it less to be distinguished from the attribute whiteness, which we ascribe to the object in consequence of its exciting the sensation. Unfortunately for clearness and due discrimination in considering these subjects, our sensations seldom receive separate names. We <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> the objects which produce in us a certain sensation: the word white. We <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> the quality in those objects, to which we ascribe the sensation: the name whiteness. But when we speak of the sensation itself (as we have not occasion to do this often except in our scientific speculations), language, which adapts itself {{for the most part}} only to the common uses of life, has provided us with no single-worded or immediate designation; we must employ a circumlocution, and say, The sensation of white, or The sensation of whiteness; we must denominate the sensation either from the object, or from the attribute, by which it is excited. Yet the sensation, though it never does, might very well be conceived to exist, without any thing whatever to excite it. We can conceive it as arising spontaneously in the mind. But if it so arose, we should have no name to denote it which would not be a misnomer. In the case of our sensations of hearing we are better provided; we have the word Sound, and a whole vocabulary of words to denote the various kinds of sounds. For as we are often conscious of these sensations {{in the absence of any}} perceptible object, we can more easily conceive having them in the absence of any object whatever. We need only shut our eyes and listen to music, to have a conception of a universe with nothing in it except sounds, and ourselves hearing them: and what is easily conceived separately, easily obtains a separate name. But in general our names of sensations denote indiscriminately the sensation and the attribute. Thus, color stands for the sensations of white, red, etc., but also for the quality in the colored object. We talk of the colors of things as among their properties.|$|E
