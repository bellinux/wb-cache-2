5|$|Chiquimula de la Sierra ("Chiquimula in the Highlands") was {{inhabited}} by Ch'orti' Maya {{at the time}} of the conquest. The first Spanish reconnaissance of this region took place in 1524. In 1526 three Spanish captains invaded Chiquimula on the orders of Pedro de Alvarado. The <b>indigenous</b> <b>population</b> soon rebelled against excessive Spanish demands, but the rebellion was quickly put down in April 1530. However, the region was not considered fully conquered until a campaign by Jorge de Bocanegra in 1531–1532 that also took in parts of Jalapa. The afflictions of Old World diseases, war and overwork in the mines and encomiendas took a heavy toll on the inhabitants of eastern Guatemala, to the extent that <b>indigenous</b> <b>population</b> levels never recovered to their pre-conquest levels.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, as {{a direct}} result of this campaign, Belgium {{formally}} annexed the territory, creating the Belgian Congo.

40|$|Obstructive sleep apnoea is {{recognised}} as {{a common}} but under-diagnosed health issue. Currently, {{there is very little}} published data relating to the burden and impact of obstructive sleep apnoea among <b>indigenous</b> <b>populations.</b> The purpose of this review was to investigate the prevalence, impact, risk factors and treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea in <b>indigenous</b> <b>populations</b> in high-income countries. An integrative review was conducted on 25 English language studies and reports that investigated obstructive sleep apnoea among <b>indigenous</b> <b>populations</b> in high-income countries. Studies that did not focus on <b>indigenous</b> <b>populations</b> in the results or discussion were excluded. Eligible studies were identified by searching PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases and reference lists of eligible studies. Publication dates range from 1998 to 2012. Synthesis of studies indicates the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea is higher and severity is greater in <b>indigenous</b> <b>populations</b> compared with non-indigenous populations. Comparable risk factors for obstructive sleep apnoea were identified in <b>indigenous</b> and non-indigenous <b>populations,</b> with only three studies identifying ethnicity as an independent risk factor. <b>Indigenous</b> <b>populations</b> in high-income countries are subject to an overall greater prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea that is also more severe. A higher prevalence of obesity, alcohol and tobacco use and comorbid medical conditions associated with low socioeconomic status rather than indigenous status per se appears to explain this disparity...|$|R

5|$|Various {{commentators}} {{noted that}} there was a renewed sense of pride among the country's <b>indigenous</b> <b>population</b> following Morales' election.

5|$|By the 18th century, the Royal Audiencia of Quito {{began to}} have {{economic}} problems; a lack of roads led to limited communications.

Obrajes were replaced by haciendas, and the dominant groups continued to exploit the <b>indigenous</b> <b>population.</b>|$|E

5|$|Chiquimula de la Sierra ("Chiquimula in the Highlands"), {{occupying the}} area of the modern {{department}} of Chiquimula to the east of the Poqomam and Chajoma, was inhabited by Ch'orti' Maya {{at the time of the}} conquest.

Nonetheless, the significant number of Norse-derived names that exist eight centuries after Viking political control ended indicate the importance of their presence on the island.

5|$|Although Carabane {{was once}} a {{regional}} capital, the village has since become so politically isolated {{from the rest of}} the country that it no longer fits into any category of the administrative structure decreed by the Senegalese government. The Jola account for the majority of the island's population and Jola society has no formal hierarchy. The <b>indigenous</b> <b>population</b> was originally animist, but although the sacred groves and fetishes survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students attend a primary school on the island, but must move at least as far as Elinkine to continue their studies.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the commercialization of}} ethnic tourism in Guatemala and Morocco in a postcolonial world. Addressing notions of authenticity, Western expectations of the ethnic tourism experience, and colonial portrayals of the Mayas and the Berbers, the thesis argues that the Guatemalan and Moroccan governments reduce their <b>indigenous</b> <b>populations</b> to ‘authentic’ living museums in their touristic promotions targeting Western tourists. Catering to Western tourists’ expectations, the Guatemalan and Moroccan governments perpetuate the stereotypes of their <b>indigenous</b> <b>populations</b> that were established during colonialism. Despite Guatemalan and Moroccan cultural repression of the Maya and the Berber populations, respectively, the governments exploit their <b>indigenous</b> <b>populations</b> for touristic purposes...|$|R
5|$|At {{the close}} of the 19th century the Catholic church in the Indies began {{targeting}} the majority-Muslim <b>indigenous</b> <b>population.</b> They were not alone; Protestant missionaries such as Sierk Coolsma of the Netherlands Missionary Union and Mattheus Teffer of the Netherlands Missionary Society had had some success with the Sundanese in Cianjur and Javanese in Ambarawa, respectively. Keijzer, before stepping down as head pastor in 1894, {{sent a letter to the}} Netherlands asking that men be sent to learn the Javanese language, in order to enable them to preach to the people and translate the catechism and some prayer books.|$|E
5|$|By 1851, {{however, the}} {{reduction}} {{system of the}} missions had disappeared. Mestizos who {{had moved to the}} area in their quest for land began to outnumber the original <b>indigenous</b> <b>population.</b> Starting with the creation of the Province of José Miguel de Velasco in 1880, the Chiquitania was split into five administrative divisions. With the rubber boom {{at the turn of the}} century, more settlers came to the areas and established large haciendas, moving the economic activities together with the native peoples out of the towns.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} 20 years of settlement, {{there was only}} limited contact between the {{settlers}} and Aboriginal people. Joseph Franklin purchased land in the Brindabellas in 1849 and attempted {{to set up a}} cattle farm. His livestock were slaughtered by the local Aboriginal people and he was driven back out of the mountains. The rush of prospectors into the Kiandra area through the Brindabellas and the mountains {{to the west of the}} ACT as a result of the Kiandra goldrush led to conflict with the Aboriginal people. By the time Franklin returned to the Brindabellas in 1863, the <b>indigenous</b> <b>population</b> had been significantly reduced.|$|E
