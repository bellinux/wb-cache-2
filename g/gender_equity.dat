5|$|Pro-{{feminism}} is {{the support}} of feminism without implying that the supporter {{is a member of}} the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, men's studies, and the development of <b>gender</b> <b>equity</b> curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} contribution of <b>gendered</b> <b>equity</b> theory and marital power to understanding variations in the division of labor, perceived equity and distress among two-earner couples. It looks at the multidimensional, relational nature of power and incorporates values and meanings in the standard models of time availability, relative resources and gender attitudes predicting the division of labor. Gender theory emphasizes power and meanings in models predicting husbands 2 ̆ 7 and wives 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of inequity. The relative contributions of comparisons, values and justifications, the key components of <b>gendered</b> <b>equity</b> theory, are assessed. Finally, all of the measures are combined in a full model testing the relationship of power, <b>gender</b> and <b>equity</b> to psychological distress using structural equation models. ^ The {{findings of this study}} suggest support for the <b>gendered</b> <b>equity</b> model of the processes by which perceived inequity is and is not related to distress among two earner spouses. First, values and meanings explain as much {{of the variance in the}} division of domestic labor as time availability and relative resources combined. Second, perceived inequity is less important for distress than a sense of empowerment in the relationship and empathy from the spouse. For many wives, the interdependence of paid and domestic work contributes to less perceived inequity, but more distress from other sources. Because husbands can separate feelings of inequity and empathy from their spouses, they are better able to manage both paid and domestic work. Assumptions regarding husband responsibility for breadwinning increases husbands 2 ̆ 7 sense of injustice and symptoms of distress. Wives 2 ̆ 7 feelings of responsibility for homemaking create barriers to husbands 2 ̆ 7 domestic work, and increase wives 2 ̆ 7 feelings of injustice and distress associated with increased paid work. Contrary to expectations, relative marital power has limited importance for couples 2 ̆ 7 distress. In addition, the relationship between perceived inequity and distress is spurious. Other factors in two earner marriages, such as values, attitudes and feelings are more important. The gendered nature of homemaking and breadwinning, the assumption of the appropriate gender for each type of work, shapes both values and feelings about these activities and the resulting division of labor. ...|$|R

25|$|In the Women and <b>Gender</b> <b>Equity</b> Knowledge Network's Final Report to the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health in 2007, {{health systems}} in many {{countries}} were noted to {{have been unable to}} deliver adequately on <b>gender</b> <b>equity</b> in health. One explanation for this issue is that many healthcare systems tend to neglect the fact that men and women’s health needs can be very different. In the report, studies have found evidence that the healthcare system can promote gender disparities in health through the lack of <b>gender</b> <b>equity</b> in terms of the way women are regarded - as both consumers (users) and producers (carers) of health care services. For instance, healthcare systems tend to regard women as objects rather than subjects, where services are often provided to women as a means of something else rather on the well-being of women. In the case of reproductive health services, these services are often provided as a form of fertility control rather than as care for women's well-being. Additionally, although the majority of the workforce in health care systems are female, many of the working conditions remain discriminatory towards women. Many studies have shown that women are often expected to conform to male work models that ignore their special needs, such as childcare or protection from violence. This significantly reduces the ability and efficiency of female caregivers providing care to patients, particularly female ones.|$|E

25|$|School feeding {{programs}} {{have the capacity}} to increase <b>gender</b> <b>equity</b> in access to education, which allows for <b>gender</b> <b>equity</b> across all spheres of social and economic life. There are a variety of reasons that girls' education is impacted by factors on both the supply and demand side of schooling. These include gender-stereotyped curriculum and teaching practices, increased risks for girls' safety outside of the house, socio-cultural practices that cause girls' education to hold a very low value, and school infrastructure that is not suitable for girls. Due to the combination of such barriers, girls are disproportionately affected by the direct and opportunity cost of schooling, which prevents girls from very poor households from attending school. Opportunity costs for girls' education include lost time that would otherwise be spent doing household chores and care work. School feeding programs reduce the costs of sending girls to school and allow for an increased number of girls to be sent to school by their families. Furthermore, improvements in female literacy that come from increased education have been linked to declining rates of fertility, increased economic opportunities, and other markers of female empowerment.|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} status {{of one of the}} core international labor standards-gender pay equity in international law. It explores how domestic legislative and judicial systems respond to the core ILO Convention No. 100 on Equal Remuneration, with the hope of unraveling under what circumstance legislative and judicial compliance occurs. The "transnational legal process" theory (which consists of three elements: internalization, interpretation and interaction) is employed to explain the phenomenon of "compliance".; The domestic jurisprudence on <b>gender</b> pay <b>equity</b> has gone a long way from "equal pay for equal work", to "equal pay for similar work", and to "equal pay for work of comparable worth". Although there is a trend in the developed countries to encompass a broad principle of equal pay, as defined in the Convention, the majority of the developing countries still struggle to do that.; The current international law on <b>gender</b> pay <b>equity</b> has achieved a general acceptance and compliance. However, the ILO conventions on equal pay are ahead of reality and far from being reflected in actual practice. General international labor standards on <b>gender</b> pay <b>equity</b> are still vague and incomprehensible to the public. In general, state's compliance with the international treaty does occur in the area of <b>gender</b> pay <b>equity,</b> but with compromise in terms of the concept of "equal pay for equal work and work of equal value", the scope of "remuneration", and "the establishment of an objective job appraisal method". To eliminate the gender wage gap, only a comprehensive legislative approach is likely to succeed...|$|R

25|$|Rastafari espouses patriarchal principles, and {{promotes}} the idea that women should submit to male leadership. External observers—including scholars like Edmonds—have claimed that Rastafari accords women an inferior position to men. Rasta discourse often presents women as morally weak and susceptible to deception by evil, and claims that they are impure during their period of menstruation. Rastafari mirrored the views on gender which were common in Jamaican society more broadly; however, it has retained its commitment to patriarchy while Jamaican society has moved toward greater <b>gender</b> <b>equity.</b> Rastas legitimise these gender roles by citing Biblical passages, particularly those in the Book of Leviticus, and {{in the writings of}} Paul the Apostle.|$|E
25|$|Poverty {{is another}} factor that {{facilitates}} the continual existence of gender disparities in health. Poverty often works in tandem with various cultural norms to indirectly impact women's health. While many communities and households are not opposed to helping women attain better health through education, better nutrition, and financial stability, poverty often act {{as a form of}} barrier against <b>gender</b> <b>equity</b> in health for women. Oftentimes, due to financial constraints and limited capital, only a select few are able to receive opportunities, like education and employment, that might help them attain better health outcomes. However, cultural norms would often prioritized men in receiving these opportunities. This prioritization of males stems from the societal perception that the potential returns to both the household and the community is higher for men than women.|$|E

The law prohibited sex discrimination in federally funded educational institutions. In the late 1960s, after noting that while programs existed to keep boys in school but no similar programs existed for girls, Green sought to correct this inequity. She helped to introduce a higher education bill that contained provisions regarding <b>gender</b> <b>equity</b> in education.
