500|$|Fleiss' kappa is a {{generalisation}} of Scott's pi statistic, {{a statistical}} measure of inter-rater reliability. [...] It is {{also related to}} Cohen's kappa statistic and Youden's J statistic which may be more appropriate in certain instances. [...] Whereas Scott's pi and Cohen's kappa work for only two raters, Fleiss' kappa works {{for any number of}} raters giving categorical ratings, to a fixed number of items. It can be interpreted as expressing {{the extent to which the}} observed amount of agreement among raters exceeds what would be expected if all raters made their ratings completely randomly. It is important to note that whereas Cohen's kappa assumes the same two raters have rated a set of items, Fleiss' kappa specifically allows that although there are a fixed number of raters (e.g., three), different items may be rated by different individuals (Fleiss, 1971, p.378). That is, <b>Item</b> <b>1</b> is rated by Raters A, B, and C; but Item 2 could be rated by Raters D, E, and F.|$|E

The items {{with the highest}} percentage of “extremely important” responses and the percentage of times they were classified among the 10 most important were identified. From this analysis, the selected items were divided into physical symptoms (8 items), emotional problems (4 <b>items),</b> functionality (<b>1</b> <b>item),</b> social problems (2 items) and existential problems (2 items), for a total of 17 items. After reviewing the literature, the authors of the instrument decided to include 8 more items that aimed to assess the following: functionality (<b>1</b> <b>item),</b> anxiety (<b>1</b> <b>item),</b> interpersonal relationships (2 items), fun and leisure (<b>1</b> <b>item)</b> inner peace (<b>1</b> <b>item),</b> irritability (<b>1</b> <b>item)</b> and financial aspects (<b>1</b> <b>item).</b> Table  <b>1</b> shows the characteristics of the patients included in this phase.|$|R

The percentages of male (47. 0 %) and female (53. 0 %) participants were about equal, and the mean age was 38. 56 years (SD = 11. 87). The results show that the SWLS has a high internal consistency reliability, a one-factor structure (with a wording effect on Items 4 and 5), strict invariance across gender, partial strict invariance across education (<b>Items</b> <b>1,</b> 2 and 3), and partial strong invariance across age, income (<b>Items</b> <b>1,</b> 2 and 3) and residential region (<b>Items</b> <b>1</b> and 2).
