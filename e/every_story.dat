5|$|We're {{not doing}} stories about a fouled-up hospital. These things really happen. <b>Every</b> <b>story</b> we've told is true.

The doctors, not the patients, are the customers; they're the ones the hospitals have to please...|$|E

5000|$|According to {{historian}} Mircea Eliade, {{for many}} traditional cultures, nearly <b>every</b> sacred <b>story</b> qualifies as an origin myth. Traditional humans tend to model their behavior after sacred events, seeing their {{life as an}} [...] "eternal return" [...] to the mythical age. Because of this conception, nearly <b>every</b> sacred <b>story</b> describes events that established a new paradigm for human behavior, and thus nearly <b>every</b> sacred <b>story</b> {{is a story about}} a creation.|$|R
5000|$|Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly complained, [...] "I {{think the}} writers of 'Once' have seen Disney's version of Aida one too many times. On this show, <b>every</b> <b>story's</b> a love story ... 'Once' has dipped into the 'star-crossed lovers' well a few times too many." ...|$|R
5|$|To {{commemorate the}} show's anniversary, <b>every</b> <b>story</b> during Season 20 {{included}} {{the return of}} an enemy from The Doctor's past. During this trilogy (begun in the serial Mawdryn Undead, and concluding with Enlightenment), the enemy was the Black Guardian, who was last encountered by the fourth incarnation of the Doctor {{at the conclusion of}} The Key to Time saga in the 1979 serial The Armageddon Factor. The story also saw the return of the White Guardian, who had also not been seen since 1979. To date, neither character, nor the Eternals, have appeared in the show again.|$|E

25|$|In nearly <b>every</b> <b>story,</b> Wolfe {{solves the}} mystery by {{considering}} the facts brought to him by Archie and others, and the replies to questions he himself asks of suspects. Wolfe ponders with his eyes closed, {{leaning back in his}} chair, breathing deeply and steadily, and pushing his lips in and out. Archie says that during these trances Wolfe reacts to nothing that is going on around him. Archie seldom interrupts Wolfe's thought processes, he says, largely because it is the only time that he can be sure that Wolfe is working.|$|E
25|$|Erdrich {{was born}} on June 7, 1954, in Little Falls, Minnesota. She was the oldest of seven {{children}} born to Ralph Erdrich, a German-American, and Rita (née Gourneau), a Chippewa Indian (of half Ojibwe and half French blood). Both parents taught at a boarding school in Wahpeton, North Dakota, {{set up by the}} Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Erdrich's maternal grandfather, Patrick Gourneau, served as tribal chairman for the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians for many years. While Erdrich was a child, her father paid her a nickel for <b>every</b> <b>story</b> she wrote. Her sister Heidi is a poet who also lives in Minnesota and publishes under the name Heid E. Erdrich. Another sister, Lise Erdrich, has written children's books and collections of fiction and essays.|$|E
25|$|Storytelling is a {{means for}} sharing and {{interpreting}} experiences. Peter L. Berger says human life is narratively rooted, humans construct their lives and shape their world into homes in terms of these groundings and memories. Stories are universal in that they can bridge cultural, linguistic and age-related divides. Storytelling can be adaptive for all ages, leaving out the notion of age segregation. Storytelling {{can be used as}} a method to teach ethics, values and cultural norms and differences. Learning is most effective when it takes place in social environments that provide authentic social cues about how knowledge is to be applied. Stories function as a tool to pass on knowledge in a social context. So, <b>every</b> <b>story</b> has 3 parts. First, The setup (The Hero's world before the adventure starts). Second, The Confrontation (The hero's world turned upside down). Third, The Resolution (Hero conquer's villain, but it's not enough for Hero to survive. The Hero or World must be transformed). Any story can be framed in such format.|$|E

500|$|According to historians, events {{surrounding}} Emmett Till's {{life and death}} continue to resonate. Some writers have suggested that almost <b>every</b> <b>story</b> about Mississippi returns to Till, or the Delta region in which he died, in [...] "some spiritual, homing way." [...] An Emmett Till Memorial Commission {{was established in the}} early 21st century. The Sumner County Courthouse was restored and includes the Emmett Till Interpretive Center. The Emmett Till Memory Project is a website and smartphone app commemorating his life; fifty-one sites in the Mississippi Delta are associated with Till.|$|E

500|$|More recently, {{there have}} been revisionist books on Harding. Robert Ferrell's The Strange Deaths of President Harding (1996), {{according}} to Coffey, [...] "spends almost the entire work challenging <b>every</b> <b>story</b> about Harding and concludes that almost everything that is read and taught about his subject is wrong." [...] In 2004, John Dean, noted for his involvement in another presidential scandal, Watergate, wrote the Harding volume in [...] "The American Presidents" [...] series of short biographies, edited by Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. Coffey deemed that book the most revisionist to date, and faults Dean for glossing over some unfavorable episodes in Harding's life, like his silence during the 1914 Senate campaign, when his opponent Hogan was being attacked for his faith.|$|E
500|$|Critic Hilary Goldstein {{described}} {{the comic book}} as [...] "about the concept of dreams {{more so than the}} act of dreaming." [...] In the early issues, responsibility and rebirth were the primary themes of the story. As Dream finally liberates himself from his occultist captors, he returns to his kingdom which had fallen on hard times due to his absence, while also facing his other siblings, who each have their own reaction to his return. The story is structured not as a series of unconnected events nor as an incoherent dream, but by having each panel have a specific purpose in the flow of the story. Dreams became the core of <b>every</b> <b>story</b> arc written in the series, and the protagonist's journey became more distinct and deliberate. Many Vertigo books since, such as Transmetropolitan and , have adopted this kind of format in their writing, creating a traditional prose only seen in the imprint.|$|E
500|$|Under {{producer}} Davies, the {{new series}} had a faster pace {{than those of}} the classic series. Rather than four to six-part serials of 25-minute episodes, most of the Ninth Doctor's stories consisted of individual 45-minute episodes, with only three stories out of ten being two-parters. The thirteen episodes were, however, loosely connected in a series-long story arc which brought their disparate threads together in the series finale. Davies took cues from American fantasy television series such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Smallville, most notably Buffys concepts of series-long story arcs and the [...] "Big Bad". Also, like the original series, stories often flowed directly into one another or were linked together in some way. Notably, in common only with the seventh and twenty-sixth seasons of the original series, <b>every</b> <b>story</b> of the season takes place on or near Earth. This fact is directly addressed in the original novel The Monsters Inside, in which Rose and the Doctor joke about the fact that all their adventures to date have taken place on Earth or on neighbouring space stations.|$|E

500|$|In 2011, SFX {{published}} an article stating arguments for and against the episode. The [...] "Defence" [...] stated that, while some minor roles were played [...] "broadly", Nina Sosanya and Abisola Agbaje were [...] "extremely good", and opined that the unusual things happening in a typical housing estate {{and the lack of}} appearance from a monster were effective. The [...] "Prosecution", on the other hand, described it as a [...] "cheap filler" [...] with a [...] "cheesy" [...] finale and called the lack of a monster a [...] "severe disappointment". Topless Robot named it the third worst Tenth Doctor episode. In a poll conducted by Doctor Who Magazine in 2009 which asked readers to rank all 200 stories that had been released, [...] "Fear Her" [...] fell at 192 out of 200, making it the lowest ranked story of the revived series. In another poll conducted by Doctor Who Magazine in 2014 asking readers to rank <b>every</b> <b>story</b> that has been broadcast in the first 50 years of the show, [...] "Fear Her" [...] fell to 240 out of 241 making it not only the lowest ranked story of the revived series, but the second lowest ranked story of all time, just coming above The Twin Dilemma.|$|E
500|$|Quesada, {{answering}} questions for Comic Book Resources, said <b>every</b> <b>story</b> {{that happened in}} the Spider-Man canon still [...] "counted", with the only change being that, due to the world's newly revised memories, Peter and Mary Jane did not marry due to some unknown incident and the official unmasking of his identity to the public during the 2007 Civil War mini-series has been forgotten. A [...] "back and forth" [...] developed between Quesada and J. Michael Straczynski in separate interviews and messages, with Straczynski outlining some of his original plans for the [...] "retcon", and conversations he had with Quesada about the storyline. Quesada said, [...] "We're committed to preserving as much of these stories as is humanly possible," [...] but he added the changing of certain elements is inevitable. For example, he sees the storyline in which Mary Jane was pregnant as never having happened. Also, Spider-Man lost the organic webshooters that he gained in the [...] "Avengers Disassembled" [...] storyline, and the other spider-like powers that he gained in the 2005-2006 storyline, [...] "." [...] Quesada commented that in removing those powers and bringing back Spider-Man's mechanical webshooters, he was returning [...] "an element that [...] felt needed to be brought back into Peter's world," [...] and that the [...] "mechanical webshooters demonstrate Peter's ingenuity and overall smarts." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the reunion}} of 1972/1973, the Byrds {{remained}} disbanded {{throughout the rest}} of the decade. [...] Roger McGuinn turned his attention to establishing his own career, releasing a series of solo albums between 1973 and 1977, and making a high-profile appearance with Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue. [...] Chris Hillman worked as part of the Souther–Hillman–Furay Band following the Byrds reunion and released a pair of solo albums entitled Slippin' Away and Clear Sailin in 1976 and 1977 respectively. [...] David Crosby returned to the supergroup Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young for their 1974 tour and subsequently continued to produce albums with Graham Nash. [...] He also took part in a 1977 reunion of Crosby, Stills & Nash, which saw the group release their multi-platinum selling CSN album. [...] Michael Clarke also found success following the Byrds reunion as the drummer for soft rock group Firefall, while Gene Clark returned to his solo career, producing the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful albums No Other (1974) and Two Sides to <b>Every</b> <b>Story</b> (1977). [...] In addition, between 1977 and 1980, McGuinn, Clark and Hillman worked on and off together as a trio, modeled after Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and, to a lesser extent, the Eagles. [...] This supergroup made up of former Byrds was reasonably successful commercially and even managed to score a Top 40 hit with the single [...] "Don't You Write Her Off" [...] in March 1979. [...] The trio toured internationally and recorded the albums McGuinn, Clark & Hillman and City. [...] Clark departed the group in late 1979, resulting in a third and final album being billed as McGuinn-Hillman.|$|E
