2500|$|Penned scripts for Ricky's exit in April 2000 {{had to be}} rewritten {{to account}} for the absence of Mike Reid who played Ricky's father Frank. The storyline {{initially}} planned to have Frank and Ricky involved in one of EastEnders renowned two-hander episodes, but due to Reid's off-screen ill-health, Steve McFadden, who plays Phil Mitchell, had to stand in for the episode, which saw Ricky flee Walford. [...] Of his departing episode, Owen stated that he was pleased Ricky's final scenes featured just him and Phil (Steve McFadden). He comments, [...] "both Phil and Ricky have had babies, broken marriages and loads of ups and downs in their lives, and it was <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it all in that episode. It's a brilliant script [...] I burst out crying, really sobbing".|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, then, Flint, it's {{your turn}} to keep guard, and Thorn's to tell his romance. Come, don't try to shirk; it does a man <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of such things, and we're all mates here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jumping dandelions {{and happy}} hollyhocks, but that smells <b>good</b> <b>to</b> me! <b>Talk</b> about your attar o' roses an' cologne factories! They ain't in it!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Lad, go on. I call it pie, nuts, sugar-candy. I {{like the}} taste uncommonly. Go on. It will do you <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> The moor is before us now, {{and there is no}} life for many a mile round." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come soon," [...] urged Savine, with a sigh. [...] "It does me <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to you--after {{the life}} I've lived, this {{everlasting}} loafing comes mighty hard to me. I believe once I {{knew we were}} victorious I could let go everything and die happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen--" [...] said Hist quickly, {{and with}} an earnestness that proved how much her {{feelings}} were concerned--"Wah-ta-Wah no Iroquois--All over Delaware--got Delaware heart--Delaware feeling. She prisoner, too. One prisoner help t'udder prisoner. No <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> more, now. Darter stay with fader--Wah-ta-Wah come and see friend--all look right--Then tell what he do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{care who}} the man is," [...] said Creedle, [...] "they {{required}} a <b>good</b> deal <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about, and that's true. It won't {{be the same}} with these." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks. Don't care if I do. Well, well! Been quite a {{while since}} I've had a <b>good</b> chance <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you, Doane. I was, uh--Sorry you didn't turn up at the last class-dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have, no doubt, a <b>good</b> deal <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about, and you needn't join {{us until}} you're ready," [...] she said. [...] "The Major always reads the London papers after dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{all very}} silent," [...] the girl continued. [...] "Why does not {{somebody}} agree with me? Don't you think it peaceful, Margaret? This might be an enchanted garden, and yonder hedge a barrier impassable to care. It is <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> nonsense occasionally; and to-night one could almost fancy that no cause for trouble might enter here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will all}} come to you in time, and when you are on board I'll show you all I can. It would do no <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about guns and the like until I can point out the {{different}} parts to you, for you wouldn't know a breech-block from a priming-wire until you laid eyes on it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] the man said, [...] "I will light a pipe. It's {{against the}} regulations, but that's {{neither here nor there}} now. Now, if you're not sleepy, {{would you mind}} talking to me? Tell me {{something}} about yourself, and how you come to be alone here in London. It does me <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> It prevents me from thinking." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Come, sergeant," [...] Ralph said, laughing, [...] "let bygones be bygones. All is fair in war, you know, {{and we did}} {{not touch}} a single hair of any of your men's heads. All we wanted was the schoolmaster. It would not do you any <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it, now, and it might do us harm. It's quite bad enough for us, as it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I decline jurisdiction,” said Glenalmond, {{with extreme}} seriousness. “But, my dear boy, {{if it will}} do you any <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> and if it will {{interest}} you at all to hear what I may choose to say when I have heard you, I am quite at your command.

6000|$|... "I knew it"--another triumphant nod. [...] "Now, {{you just}} {{tell me all about}} it. It'll do you <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> it over with somebody. Here, I'll pretend I'm looking at shirtwaists, so that floor walker won't be coming down on you, and I'll be as hard to please as that other woman was, so's you can take your time. Who's sick--and what's the matter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{that you}} may, lad, and unless succor comes soon I shall speak quite as plainly {{to all the}} garrison, for to-morrow morning the rations are of a {{necessity}} to be cut down one-half, which will give our discontented men <b>good</b> chance <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of starvation." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Because it ain't <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about. Gabriel dear," [...] she continued, with {{a slight}} quivering of the upper lip, [...] "sometimes I think the people round yer look upon us sorter queer. That little boy that came here with the {{emigrant}} family wouldn't play with me, and Mrs. Markle's little girl said that we did dreadful things {{up there in the}} snow. He said I was a cannon-ball." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I decline jurisdiction," [...] said Glenalmond, {{with extreme}} seriousness.

60|$|When {{he reached}} the shack he told Scott nothing {{about what he had}} heard, because he thought Father Lucien would sooner he did not. The latter knew when to be silent and it would do no <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the matter unless {{something}} happened to throw a light upon the mystery. On the whole, he was relieved when Driscoll, who soon recovered, set off up river with a half-breed and a loaded hand-sledge.|$|E
50|$|While there, he is {{approached}} by Elizabeth Maitland and Captain <b>Good</b> <b>to</b> find her father. He refuses, not knowing who she is, and she leaves her father's card on the bar.

6000|$|... "It's Dan Fernald, aunt Dorcas," [...] Plums said, {{as if in}} {{surprise}} {{that she should have}} interfered. [...] "It's the same feller what wasn't goin' to show you the paper till you'd 'greed to board him the balance of the summer, an' in less than a half an hour after you went away he set the barn afire.

6000|$|... “Talk decent, Benjamin,” {{said the}} housekeeper, “Or I won’t keep your company. I don’t gainsay her being comely to look on, but I will {{maintain}} that she’s {{likely to show}} poor conduct. She seems to think herself too <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to a body. From what Squire Jones had telled me, I some expected to be quite captivated by her company. Now, to my reckoning, Lowizy Grant is much more pritty behaved than Betsey Temple. She wouldn’t so much as hold discourse with me when I wanted to ask her how she felt on coming home and missing her mammy.” ...|$|E
