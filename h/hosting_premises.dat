The ambition of the thesis was not to provide an exhaustive analysis of the integration process of all Sub-Saharan communities living in Europe, but rather to give an insight of certain aspects of the integration reality of Sub-Saharan immigrants through an example of 68 respondents living in selected cities - against a background of national integration policies of the respective <b>host</b> society. <b>Premises</b> of research: 1.

Certain enterprises might want {{data to be}} partly <b>hosted</b> on <b>premise</b> in the enterprise and also partly hosted in the cloud, while other enterprises might their applications to be fully hosted on the cloud. Such hybrid possibilities can enable enterprises to benefit from cloud-based architectures, while honouring application performance requirements, but privacy issues and security considerations is always a problem during migration. This work highlights the need for security in the cloud; Different features offered by cloud providers are explored. Concepts like Virtual machine migration and a hardware chip {{that can be used}} as a basis for trust in the cloud are discussed. Pre-migration hints shows what needs to be done before the actual secure migration paths set-in. The migration path is based on a generalisation of the kind of threats these features are exposed to. There are arguments as to why such paths are the most secure. It is a fact that cloud computing infrastructures enable companies to cut costs by outsourcing computations on-demand, however, clients of cloud computing services currently have no well acknowledged means of verifying the confidentiality and integrity of their data and computation. To address this problem, it was part of the migration strategy in this work to design a system that enables a cloud provider to provide an execution environment that guarantees integrity in the execution of virtual machines for its clients, but the design works in hand with a trusted third party.

50|$|Unlike {{some other}} Poznań colleges, also <b>hosted</b> in <b>premises</b> {{inherited}} from Prussian schools, after World War Two the re-born Liceum Dąbrówki keeps claiming Luisian heritage and poses as an establishment {{set up in}} 1830; this is the reading advanced on its official web page and in numerous commemorative publications. None of them specifies what the alleged continuity consists of. The seminarian teachers’ courses, continued by Uczelnia Dąbrówki after the closure of Luisenschule, were shut down in 1930. Uczelnia Dąbrówki operated in the post-Luisenschule premises until the German takeover of Poznań in 1939. As after 1945 they were marked for judicial authorities, Dąbrówka was first hosted in few temporary locations until it settled at Plac Bernardyński, in the premises taken over from Liceum św. Marii Magdaleny, another Poznań college; considered hotbed of reactionary education, as means of repression it was shut down by the communist authorities. In 1967 another thread was discontinued when Liceum Dąbrówki was turned from a girls-only into a mixed-sex school. Last but not least, Dąbrówka no longer boasts of a prestigious status; among some 30 Poznań colleges, the school stands around number 10.Gorka Palace, which for 43 years (1836-1880) served as Luisenschule premises, was damaged {{during the battle of}} Poznań but brought back to former shape; currently it accommodates the Archeological Museum. Three buildings at Muhlenstrasse, which hosted Luisenschule for 39 years (1880-1919), were mostly destroyed by artillery fire, also in 1945. The only one still standing was repaired and turned into a dormitory for non-resident students of Poznań colleges, recently operational as Bursa Szkolna nr 6. Remaining documents, produced by Luisenschule, are held partially in state archives in Poznań and partially in the Dąbrówka Liceum.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the case {{study was to investigate}} and identify environmental health related concerns and possible causes of the incursion of Japanese Encephalitis on Badu Island, Torres Strait. The arbovirus was identified in Australia in 1995. Five cases, including two deaths, occurred between 1995 and 1998 with one of these becoming infected on the Mitchell River, Cape York Peninsula. Investigations ensued including serological study of pigs and humans, entomological studies, community interviews and wind/vector studies. The major issues identified included close proximity of domestic pigs (effective amplifying <b>host)</b> to residential <b>premises,</b> and high larval numbers in the environment surrounding dwellings including waterholes, blocked drains and rubbish waste. Computer simulated studies revealed the possibility that a viraemic JE mosquito was windblown from Papua New Guinea to Australia. Management action included attempts at environmental clearance for vector control, wide vaccination campaign, and further enforcement of quarantine requirements, public education and the deployment of sentinel surveillance pigs on Cape York Peninsula. The virus continues to be controlled at this point but lingers as a constant threat and efforts to contain it outside of mainland Australia remain considerable, to protect mortality and morbidity of those living in the Torres Strait and northern Australia...|$|R

Given that rumenmicrobial fermenta-tion plays {{a pivotal role}} in <b>host</b> nutrition, the <b>premise</b> that rumenmicrobiota may contribute to host feed efficiency is gaining momentum. Since diet is a major factor in determining rumen community structure and fermentation patterns, we investigated the effect of divergence in phenotypic residual feed intake (RFI) on ruminal community structure of beef cattle across two con-trasting diets. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) were performed to profile the rumen bacterial population and to quantify the ruminal populations of Entodinium spp., protozoa, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Ruminococcus albus, Prevotella brevis, the genus Prevotella, and fungi in 14 low (efficient) - and 14 high (inefficient) -RFI animals offered a low-energy, high-forage diet, followed by a high-energy, low-forage diet. Canonical cor-respondence and Spearman correlation analyses were used to investigate associations between physiological variables and ru-menmicrobial structure and specific microbial populations, respectively. The effect of RFI on bacterial profiles was influenced by diet, with the association between RFI group and PCR-DGGE profiles stronger for the higher forage diet. qPCR showed that Prevotella abundance was higher (P< 0. 0001) in inefficient animals. A higher (P< 0. 0001) abundance of Entodinium and Pre-votella spp. and a lower (P< 0. 0001) abundance of Fibrobacter succinogeneswere observed when animals were offered the low-forage diet. Thus, differences in the ruminal microflora may contribute to host feed efficiency, although this effect may also be modulated by the diet offered...|$|R
