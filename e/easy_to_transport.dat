25|$|Nearly {{all have}} been found in {{north-east}} Scotland, the majority in Aberdeenshire, the fertile land lying to the east of the Grampian Mountains. A similar distribution to that of Pictish symbols led to the early suggestion that Carved Stone Balls are Pictish artefacts. The core distribution also reflects that of the Recumbent stone circles. As objects they are very <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>transport</b> and a few have been found on Iona, Skye, Harris, Uist, Lewis, Arran, Hawick, Wigtownshire and fifteen from Orkney. Outside Scotland examples {{have been found in}} Ireland at Ballymena, and in England at Durham, Cumbria, Lowick and Bridlington. The larger (90mm diameter) balls are all from Aberdeenshire, bar one from Newburgh in Fife.|$|E
25|$|Telescopic {{fishing rods}} are {{designed}} to collapse down to a short length and open to a long rod. 20 or even 30ft rods can close to {{as little as a}} foot and a half. This makes the rods very <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>transport</b> to remote areas or travel on buses, compact cars, or public buses and subways. Telescopic fishing rods are made from the same materials as conventional multi-piece rods. Graphite, carbon, and sometimes fibreglass, or composites of these materials, {{are designed to}} slip into each other so that they open and close. The eyes on the spinning rods are generally, but not always, a special design to aid in making the end of each section stronger. Various grade eyes available in conventional rods are also available in telescopic fishing rods. The eyeless Tenkara style rods are also of this type and are typically made from carbon and/or graphite.|$|E

500|$|Drilling fluids {{are chosen}} {{to balance the}} {{pressure}} so that the hole remains stable. [...] The fluid must have a low kinematic viscosity to reduce tripping time (the time taken to pull the drilling equipment {{out of the hole}} and return it {{to the bottom of the}} hole). [...] Since retrieval of each segment of core requires tripping, a slower speed of travel through the drilling fluid could add significant time to a project—a year or more for a deep hole. [...] The fluid must contaminate the ice as little as possible; it must have low toxicity, for safety and to minimize the effect on the environment; it must be available at a reasonable cost; and it must be relatively <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>transport.</b> [...] Historically, there have been three main types of ice drilling fluids: two-component fluids based on kerosene-like products mixed with fluorocarbons to increase density; alcohol compounds, including aqueous ethylene glycol and ethanol solutions; and esters, including n-butyl acetate. [...] Newer fluids have been proposed, including new ester-based fluids, low-molecular weight dimethyl siloxane oils, fatty-acid esters, and kerosene-based fluids mixed with foam-expansion agents.|$|E
2500|$|The Dyott {{monoplane}} {{was named}} after its designer and owner, George Dyott. He had earned Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate (no. 114) in 1911 and designed his cross country machine the following year. One strength of the design was the simplicity of rigging and assembly, making it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>transport</b> by land or sea where necessary. [...] The machine was built by [...] Hewlett & Blondeau of Clapham, London.|$|E
2500|$|Mongol armies {{traveled}} light, {{and were}} able to live largely off the land. Their equipment included fish hooks and other tools meant to make each warrior independent of any fixed supply source. The most common travel food of the Mongols was dried and ground meat borts, which remains common in Mongolian cuisine today. Borts is light and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>transport,</b> and can be cooked with water similarly to a modern [...] "instant soup".|$|E

2500|$|When a {{place is}} besieged I {{know how to}} cut off water from the {{trenches}} and construct an infinite variety of bridges, mantlets and scaling ladders, and other instruments pertaining to sieges. I also have types of mortars that are very convenient and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>transport....</b> when a place cannot be reduced by the method of bombardment either because of its height or its location, I have methods for destroying any fortress or other stronghold, even if it be founded upon rock. ....If the engagement be at sea, I have many engines of a kind most efficient for offence and defence, and ships that can resist cannons and powder.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{historical}} Algonquin society was largely hunting- and fishing-based, some Algonquin practiced agriculture and cultivated corn, beans and squash, the famous [...] "Three Sisters" [...] of indigenous horticulture. Being primarily a hunting nation, the people emphasized mobility. [...] They used materials that were light [...] and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>transport.</b> Canoes {{were made of}} birch bark, sewed with spruce roots and rendered waterproof by the application of heated spruce resin and bear grease. [...] During winter, toboggans were used to transport material, and people used snowshoes to get around. [...] The women used tikinaagan (cradleboards) to carry their babies. [...] It was built with wood and covered with an envelope made of leather or material. The baby was standing up with his feet resting on a small board. The mother would then put the tikinàgan on her back. This allowed the infant to look around and observe his surroundings. [...] The child was kept close to the mother but also had much stimulation.|$|E
60|$|One {{tropical}} species which adopts {{the tactics}} of hiding itself in the hard clay, the African mud-fish, is specially interesting to us human beings on two accounts--first, because, unlike almost all other kinds of fish, it possesses lungs as well as gills; and, secondly, because it forms an intermediate link between the true fish and the frogs or amphibians, and therefore stands in all probability in the direct line of human descent, being the living representative of one among our own remote and early ancestors. Scientific interest and filial piety ought alike to secure our attention for the African mud-fish. It lives its amphibious life among the rice-fields on the Nile, the Zambesi, and the Gambia, and is so greatly given to a terrestrial existence that its swim-bladder has become porous and cellular, {{so as to be}} modified into a pair of true and serviceable lungs. In fact, the lungs themselves in all the higher animals are merely the swim-bladders of fish, slightly altered so as to perform a new but closely allied office. The mud-fish is common enough in all the larger English aquariums, owing to a convenient habit in which it indulges, and which permits it to be readily conveyed to all parts of the globe on the same principle as the vans for furniture. When the dry season comes on and the rice-fields are reduced to banks of baking mud, the mud-fish retire to the bottom of their pools, where they form for themselves a sort of cocoon of hardened clay, lined with mucus, and with a hole at each end to admit the air; and in this snug retreat they remain torpid till the return of wet weather. As the fish usually reach a length of three or four feet, the cocoons are of course by no means <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>transport</b> entire. Nevertheless the natives manage to dig them up whole, fish and all; and if the capsules are not broken, the unconscious inmates can be sent across by steamer to Europe with perfect safety. Their astonishment when they finally wake up after their long slumber, and find themselves inspecting the British public, as introduced to them by Mr. Farini, through a sheet of plate-glass, must be profound and interesting.|$|E

5000|$|... "Clonewheel organ" [...] is a {{musician}} jargon {{term used to}} refer to an electronic musical instrument that emulates (or [...] "s") the sound of the electromechanical tonewheel-based organs formerly manufactured by Hammond from the 1930s to the 1970s. Clonewheel organs generate sounds using solid-state circuitry or computer chips, rather than with heavy mechanical tonewheels, making clonewheel organs much lighter-weight and smaller than vintage Hammonds, and <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>transport</b> <b>to</b> live performances and recording sessions.|$|R
