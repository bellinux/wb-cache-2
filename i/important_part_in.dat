5|$|Historian Katharine Glover {{argues that}} women had less means of public {{participation}} than men {{and that as}} a result piety and an active religious life may have been more important for women from the social elite. Church going played an <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the lives of many women. Women were largely excluded from the administration of the kirk, but when heads of households voted on the appointment of a new minister some parishes allowed women in that position to participate.|$|E
5|$|In {{central and}} eastern Europe, the state played {{a greater role in}} organising these pilgrimages. The National Orthodox Romanian Women's Society, {{supported}} by the church and the state, played an <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> enabling regular pilgrimages to important Romanian sites up until 1939. In Germany and Italy, the Fascist governments took a keen interest in organising such journeys. In Italy, these involved large, state-influenced organisations, and the government steadily discouraged private visits or unofficial groups from taking part in alternative ceremonies at these sites. In Nazi Germany, pilgrimages were organised to the new war memorials sponsored by the government in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1840s, California fought for its {{independence}} from Mexico in the Mexican–American War.

In 1847, one year after the Bear Flag Revolt, a Mexican military force set out northwards to attack a smaller American force in the Los Angeles area. However, the Santa Ana River flooded, preventing the Mexicans from crossing the river to attack the Americans. When the river's flow finally subsided, the American forces had been reinforced enough to drive the Mexicans out of the region.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the four}} early medieval sources {{relevant}} to Thurisind that survive, {{the only one}} providing independent evidence of the king, accounts of Justinian's wars, and {{a detailed account of}} the relations between Gepids and Lombards and their kings is De Bellis (550s), the most important work of Procopius. Considered the greatest historian of the 6th century, Procopius was a Greek writer born in Caesarea in Palestine in 527. The Lombard–Gepid wars are well described in Procopius' work, as the conflict played an <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the Byzantine plans to invade Italy by a land route.|$|E
5|$|Scales play an <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> {{the natural}} history of Lepidoptera. Scales enable the {{development}} of vivid or indistinct patterns which help the organism protect itself by camouflage, mimicry and warning. Besides providing insulation, dark patterns on wings allow sunlight to be absorbed and are probably involved in thermoregulation. Bright and distinctive colour patterns in butterflies which are distasteful to predators help communicate their toxicity or inedibility, thus preventing predation. In Batesian mimicry, wing colour patterns help edible lepidopterans mimic inedible models, while in Müllerian mimicry, inedible butterflies resemble each other to reduce the numbers of individuals sampled by inexperienced predators.|$|E

5|$|The New Zealand Defence Force {{consists}} of three services: the New Zealand Army; the Royal New Zealand Air Force; and the Royal New Zealand Navy. New Zealand's national defence needs are modest, since a direct attack is unlikely. However, its military has had a global presence. The country fought in both world wars, with notable campaigns in Gallipoli, Crete, El Alamein and Cassino. The Gallipoli campaign played an <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> fostering New Zealand's national identity and strengthened the ANZAC tradition it shares with Australia.|$|E

5|$|Women {{acted as}} an {{important}} part of the workforce. Many unmarried women worked away from their families as farm servants and married women worked with their husbands around the farm, taking part in all the major agricultural tasks. They had a particular role as shearers in the harvest, forming most of the reaping team of the bandwin. Women also played an <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the expanding textile industries, spinning and setting up warps for men to weave. There is evidence of single women engaging in independent economic activity, particularly for widows, who can be found keeping schools, brewing ale and trading.|$|E
