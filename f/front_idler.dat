500|$|The [...] Škoda T-11/0 four-cylinder, {{water-cooled}} engine produced [...] at 1,800rpm. Two {{fuel tanks}} were fitted, the main tank with {{a capacity of}} [...] was {{on the left side}} of the engine and the [...] auxiliary tank was on the other side. The engine could run on gasoline, an alcohol-gasoline mixture, and [...] "Dynalkohol" [...] (an alcohol-benzole mixture). It was mounted in the rear along with the six-speed transmission which drove rear-mounted drive sprockets. The suspension was derived from the Vickers 6-Ton tank; eight small pairs of road wheels on four bogies per side, each pair of bogies sprung by a single leaf spring, a <b>front</b> <b>idler</b> wheel, and four track return wheels. An unsprung road wheel was located directly underneath the idler wheel to improve obstacle crossing. The transmission, brakes and steering were mechanically assisted with compressed air, reducing driver fatigue. This last feature proved problematic in the extreme conditions of the Eastern Front.|$|E
50|$|The tractor's most {{distinctive}} feature was its running gear. Four full height roadwheels acted as roadwheels, rear drive sprocket, <b>front</b> <b>idler</b> and track return rollers. This {{was the same}} layout as the Tetrarch light tank, which Vickers-Armstrongs had developed in the 1930s.|$|E
50|$|The United States would supply: the engine; radiator; fan; piping; silencer; lighting; dynamo; battery; {{propeller}} shaft; transmission, including gearbox; brakes; roller sprockets; {{gear shift}} and brake control; track links and pins; rear track sprockets, hub and shafts; <b>front</b> <b>idler</b> hub and shafts; track roller, track spindles and bushings.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} {{consisted of}} twelve torsion bars {{for the six}} road wheels on either side. The drive sprockets were at the back, and the <b>front</b> <b>idlers</b> were identical to the road wheels. Each track {{was made up of}} 90 links. There were three internal fuel tanks, two in the crew area and one in the engine compartment. These were usually supplemented with four unconnected external fuel tanks. Twelve and 24-volt electrical power supplies came from a 1 kW generator feeding four accumulator batteries.|$|R
5000|$|... was {{a magnet}} for the town's young blades and {{affluent}} business leaders. The hotel {{was one of the}} few places in Los Angeles with shade trees in <b>front,</b> where <b>idlers</b> would gather on warm afternoons to wait for the Banning stage from San Pedro with passengers and newspapers from the East.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} {{is of the}} {{torsion bar}} type with either side consisting of five dual road wheels with the drive sprocket at the <b>front,</b> the <b>idler</b> at the rear and two track-return rollers. The first and last road wheel stations are provided with a hydraulic shock-absorber. The 4K 4FA has no NBC system, night vision equipment or amphibious capability.|$|R
50|$|The {{driver and}} {{powerpack}} {{are at the}} front of the hull with a fully enclosed turret at the rear. It has torsion bar suspension with six dual rubber tyred road wheels, a drive sprocket at the <b>front,</b> <b>idler</b> at the rear and track return rollers. The PLZ-52 is offered for export.|$|E
50|$|The {{first major}} design change to tracked loaders {{came with the}} {{integration}} of hydraulic systems. Using hydraulics to power the loader linkages increased {{the power of the}} loader. More importantly, the loaders could apply downpressure to the bucket, vastly increasing their ability to dig unworked ground. Most of the tracked loaders were still based on a bulldozer equivalent. The weight of the engine was still on the front half of the tracks along with the heavy loader components. This caused many problems with heavy wear of the <b>front</b> <b>idler</b> wheels and the undercarriage in general. The Caterpillar 983 tracked loader, the second largest tracked loader ever built, was notorious for heavy undercarriage wear.|$|E
50|$|The hull {{is made of}} {{welded steel}} plates and ensures {{protection}} against bullet caliber 7.62 mm and artillery splinters. The suspension is torsion bar. Road wheels (six from each drive sprocket) have holes to reduce weight. MLVM is fully amphibious, being propelled with a maximum speed of 5-6 km/h in water. Prior to the crossing of rivers or lakes (although the MLVM is amphibious, it is not designed for marine infantry use), a trim vane must be erected at the front and bilge pumps turned on, taking no more than 5 minutes. Suspension is torsion bar type with six rubber-tyred spoked road wheels either side, drive sprocket at the <b>front,</b> <b>idler</b> at the rear and track-return rollers. Some vehicles have been observed with five - not six - road wheels.|$|E
50|$|The vehicle has a 4-stroke {{diesel engine}} {{satisfying}} a minimum power-to-weight ratio of 25 hp/ton. Suspension {{is of the}} torsion bar type with either side having five dual road wheels, drive sprocket at the <b>front,</b> and <b>idler</b> at the rear and three shock absorbers on each side. The vehicle can be equipped with either conventional T130 or T150 tracks or rubber band tracks. Steering is of the hydro-static type.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicle is}} powered by a {{turbocharged}} diesel engine which is capable of developing a power of 300 hp. The power pack provides a maximum speed of 70 km/h. The vehicle has an operational range of 200 km, which can be increased to 400 km by additional fuel tanks. It is fitted with torsion bar suspension system. The running gear {{on either side of the}} vehicle's hull includes five road wheels with the drive sprocket at the <b>front</b> and <b>idler</b> at the rear. The upper part of the suspension is covered by armour plates.|$|R
50|$|Final drives {{are mounted}} in the <b>front</b> and the <b>idler</b> {{sprockets}} with track tensioners are mounted at the rear. The running gear has six road wheel stations per side, which guide a lightweight steel or segmented rubber band-type track. The road wheels are mounted on a suspension system comprising swing arms with conventional torsion bars and damper systems, this set-up is proven to be reliable and cost-efficient.|$|R
5000|$|The {{suspension}} {{was of the}} Christie type, {{with long}} helical springs (in tension) angled back to keep the hull sides low. Of the five road wheels each side, four had shock absorbers. The tracks were driven by sprocketed wheels at the rear and tension adjusted at the <b>front</b> <b>idler,</b> this being standard British practice. Some variants were produced with 14 in tracks; later, 15.5-inch tracks were used. As with previous Christie-suspension cruiser tanks, there were no track return rollers, the track being supported instead {{on the tops of}} the road wheels, known as the [...] "slack-track" [...] design. The side of the hull was made up of two spaced plates, the suspension units between them, and the outer plate having cutouts for the movement of the road-wheel axles.|$|E
5000|$|The 8.62 L Škoda T-11/0 four-cylinder, {{water-cooled}} engine produced [...] at 1,800 rpm. Two {{fuel tanks}} were fitted, the main tank with {{a capacity of}} 124 L was {{on the left side}} of the engine and the 29 L auxiliary tank was on the other side. The engine could run on gasoline, an alcohol-gasoline mixture, and [...] "Dynalkohol" [...] (an alcohol-benzole mixture). It was mounted in the rear along with the six-speed transmission which drove rear-mounted drive sprockets. The suspension was derived from the Vickers 6-Ton tank; eight small pairs of road wheels on four bogies per side, each pair of bogies sprung by a single leaf spring, a <b>front</b> <b>idler</b> wheel, and four track return wheels. An unsprung road wheel was located directly underneath the idler wheel to improve obstacle crossing. The transmission, brakes and steering were mechanically assisted with compressed air, reducing driver fatigue. This last feature proved problematic in the extreme conditions of the Eastern Front.|$|E
5000|$|A {{tracked vehicle}} uses a {{combination}} of wheels and rollers, including drive sprockets, idler wheels, track return rollers and road wheels. It is quite similar in concept to a conveyor belt, only instead of a machine carrying objects {{on top of a}} powered continuous belt, it's a machine that moves itself over a continuous belt. In a typical application, power is transmitted to a drive sprocket (or drive wheel), which drives the track around its loop. On {{the opposite end of the}} vehicle, there is an idler wheel, which provides a pulley wheel of sorts. On some applications, the drive sprocket and idler wheel carry some of the weight of the vehicle, for the purposes of this description, we will assume the drive sprocket and idler wheel are not weight-bearing units, and the drive sprocket is on the front (see M4 Sherman for an example). Since the drive sprocket can be at either the front (M4 Sherman) or the rear (M1 Abrahms) of the vehicle depending on the design, the idler wheel either carries the track back off the ground and returns it to the drive sprocket (rear idler wheel), or receives track from the drive sprocket and lays it down in front of the road wheels (<b>front</b> <b>idler</b> wheel). The idler wheel is not powered, just like an idler gear. Although it technically reverses the tracks direction (but not its rotation), this has nothing to do with the term [...] "idler"; it is not related to an idler gear other than that they are both [...] "idle", or not doing any work, only transmitting power ("idle" [...] being a term for something or someone who isn't working). The road wheels are a series of non-powered wheels between the drive sprocket and idler wheel that serve to support the weight of the vehicle (and thus aren't considered [...] "idle", even though they are unpowered). In higher speed applications, such as tanks and other AFV's, these road wheels are typically given some sort of suspension system to ease the ride, increase controllability, and decrease wear and tear. Due to the complications in adding suspension systems to the idler wheel and, in particular, the drive sprocket, in such vehicles, the road wheels typically carry all of the weight of the vehicle. In low speed applications, such as bulldozers, these road wheels lack any kind of suspension system, as the low speeds don't demand the cushioning. This also allows the idler and drive wheels to carry some of the weight, as their lack of suspension is made irrelevant. Track return rollers may or may not be used, and are simply small rollers which support the weight of the track as it's transferred from rear to front to be laid down again.The track simply provides a solid [...] "road" [...] for the road wheels to roll over on over all surfaces: the road wheels roll the vehicle along the self-created [...] "road", while the drive sprocket forces the vehicle forward along the track and lays down [...] "fresh" [...] track. The idler picks the [...] "used" [...] track back up, and returns it back to the drive sprocket in the front. This is why an early term for a tracked vehicle was a [...] "track-laying machine" [...] (not to be confused with railroad track laying equipment). Transporting vehicles over muddy ground often required planks or logs to be placed along the track (see corduroy road, plank road). In the later 19th century, inventors figured out a way to make a rolling machine that would lay its own plank road wherever it went, negating the need for farmers to lay down logs in order to traverse muddy areas. Other benefits were discovered later.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vehicle was}} {{powered by a}} [...] Mitisubishi 8 HA 21 WT V8 diesel engine mounted behind the bow gunner. Its tracks were fitted with five road wheels, with a drive wheel at the <b>front</b> and an <b>idler</b> wheel at the rear. Torsion bar {{suspension}} was fitted. No night vision equipment or NBC protection was fitted. The vehicle could ford {{to a depth of}} 1 m.|$|R
40|$|Quantum {{spectroscopy}} {{was performed}} using the frequency-entangled broadband photon pairs generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion. An absorptive sample {{was placed in}} <b>front</b> of the <b>idler</b> photon detector, and the frequencies of signal photons were resolved by a diffraction grating. The absorption spectrum {{of the sample was}} measured by counting the coincidences, and the result is in agreement with the one measured by a spectrophotometer with a classical light source...|$|R
5000|$|So in 1936 a {{new vehicle}} was {{imported}} from the traditional supplier, the Vickers company - Belgian experiences with ordering from competing foreign companies such as the Renault company had been very disappointing (see AMC 35). This was the Vickers-Carden-Loyd Light Dragon Mk. II B (see Light tanks of the United Kingdom) in the export version, equipped with a 88 hp Meadows 6 cylinder gasoline engine and a [...] "crash" [...] type gearbox. The general design of the vehicle was almost identical to the T-15 Light tank already in service with the Belgian armed forces, also designed and produced by the Vickers company. The suspension was made out of Horstmann suspensions resting on bogies with two rubber-lined wheel sets per bogie. The drive sprocket was in the <b>front,</b> the <b>idlers</b> {{were placed in the}} rear, with three return rollers. Steering was again a combination of declutching the drive to one track and braking to increase the turn.|$|R
25|$|Initially the {{armament}} was a Type 91 6.5×50mm machine gun, {{although in}} later models carried a Type 92 7.7 mm machine gun. The suspension consisted of four bogies - two on each side. These were suspended by bell-cranks resisted by armored compression springs placed horizontally, one {{each side of}} the hull, externally. Each bogie had two small rubber road wheels with the drive sprocket at the <b>front</b> and the <b>idler</b> at the rear. There were two track-return rollers. In combat service the Type 94 was found to be prone to throwing its tracks in high speed turns. Further redesign work was carried out in 1937 on the suspension and the small idler was replaced by a larger diameter idler wheel suspended from a rocker arm which was now in ground contact; it did not completely solve the problem. A better suspension on a longer chassis appeared in later models of the Type 94.|$|R
