500|$|Raised as a Lutheran, Gingrich was a Southern Baptist in {{graduate}} school. He converted to Catholicism, Bisek's faith, on March 29, 2009. He said: [...] "over {{the course of}} several years, I gradually became Catholic and then decided one day to accept the faith I had already come to embrace". He decided to officially become a Catholic when he saw Pope Benedict XVI, during the Pope's visit to the United States in 2008: [...] "Catching a glimpse of Pope Benedict that day, I was struck by the happiness and peacefulness he exuded. The joyful and radiating presence of the Holy Father was a moment of confirmation about the many things I had been thinking and experiencing for several years." [...] At a 2011 appearance in Columbus, Ohio, he said, [...] "In America, religious belief <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>challenged</b> by a cultural elite trying to create a secularized America, in which God is driven out of public life." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{this period}} {{and beyond the}} Anglo-Saxon culture is changing. Politically and chronologically, the texts of this period are not 'Anglo-Saxon'; linguistically, those written in English (as opposed to Latin or French, the other {{official}} written languages of the period) are {{moving away from the}} late West Saxon standard that is called 'Old English'. Yet neither are they 'Middle English'; moreover, as Treharne explains, for around three quarters of this period, [...] "there is barely any 'original' writing in English at all". These factors have led to a gap in scholarship implying a discontinuity either side of the Norman Conquest, however this assumption <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>challenged.</b>|$|E
2500|$|During the Crusades, {{there were}} in fact too many armored knights in France for the land to support. Some {{scholars}} believe {{that one of the}} driving forces behind the Crusades was an attempt by such landless knights to find land overseas, without causing the type of internecine warfare that would largely damage France's increasing military strength. However, such historiographical work on the Crusades <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>challenged</b> and rejected by {{a large part of the}} historical community. The ultimate motivation or motivations for any one individual are difficult to know, but regardless, nobles and knights from France generally formed very sizeable contingents of crusading expeditions. Crusaders were so predominantely French that the word [...] "crusader" [...] in the Arabic language is simply known as Al-Franj or [...] "The Franks" [...] and Old French became the lingua franca of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.|$|E
2500|$|Dissociation, {{the term}} that {{underlies}} the dissociative disorders including DID, lacks a precise, empirical, and generally agreed upon definition. A {{large number of}} diverse experiences have been termed dissociative, ranging from normal failures in attention to the breakdowns in memory processes characterized by the dissociative disorders. [...] Thus it is unknown {{if there is a}} common root underlying all dissociative experiences, or if the range of mild to severe symptoms is a result of different etiologies and biological structures. [...] Other terms used in the literature, including personality, personality state, identity, ego state and amnesia, also have no agreed upon definitions. [...] Multiple competing models exist that incorporate some non-dissociative symptoms while excluding dissociative ones. [...] The most widely used model of dissociation conceptualizes DID as at one extreme of a continuum of dissociation, with flow at the other end, though this model <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>challenged.</b>|$|E
