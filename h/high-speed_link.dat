40|$|Abstract—While {{channel coding}} is a {{standard}} method of improving a system’s energy efficiency in digital communications, its practice does not extend to <b>high-speed</b> <b>links.</b> Increasing demands in network speeds are placing a large burden on the energy efficiency of <b>high-speed</b> <b>links</b> and render the benefit of channel coding for these systems a timely subject. The low error rates of interest {{and the presence of}} residual intersymbol interference (ISI) caused by hardware constraints impede the analysis and simulation of coded <b>high-speed</b> <b>links.</b> Focusing on the residual ISI and combined noise as the dominant error mechanisms, this paper analyzes error correlation through concepts of error region, channel signature, and correlation distance. This framework provides a deeper insight into joint error behaviors in <b>high-speed</b> <b>links,</b> extends the range of statistical simulation for coded <b>high-speed</b> <b>links,</b> and provides a case against the use of biased Monte Carlo methods in this setting. Finally, based on a hardware test bed, the performance of standard binary forward error correction and error detection schemes is evaluated, from which recommendations on coding for <b>high-speed</b> <b>links</b> are derived.

25|$|The road both Harriman and Hill {{looked at}} was the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy. To Harriman, the Burlington was a road which paralleled {{much of his}} own, and offered tantalizing direct access to Chicago. For Hill as well, there was the {{possibility}} of a <b>high-speed</b> <b>link</b> directly with Chicago. Though the Burlington did not parallel the Great Northern or the Northern Pacific, it would give them a powerful railroad in the central West. Harriman was the first to approach the Burlington's aging chieftain, the irascible Charles Elliott Perkins. The price for control of the Burlington, as set by Perkins, was $200 a share, more than Harriman was willing to pay. Hill, however, met the price, and control of the Burlington was divided equally at about 48.5percent each between the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I {{present the}} method to {{efficiently}} detect TCP port scans in very <b>high-speed</b> <b>links.</b> The main {{idea of this}} method is to discard most of the handshake packets without loss in accuracy. With two Bloom filters that track active destinations and TCP handshakes, the algorithm can easily discard about 80 % of all handshake packets with negligible loss in accuracy. This significantly reduces both the memory requirements and CPU cost. Next, I present my own extension of this algorithm, which significantly reduces the number of false positives caused {{by the lack of}} communication from the server to the client.

2500|$|The {{construction}} of a [...] stretch of high-speed line from Madrid to Toledo allowed the inauguration of a medium distance service in November 2005.

Furthermore, since Toledo is now connected by standard-gauge track {{it is impossible for}} other passenger or goods trains to reach it that have not come from other high-speed lines.|$|E
