40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Radiography has an {{important}} role in the diagnosis of diseases. Professional responsibility necessitates that <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners</b> have adequate and sound knowledge about the techniques to minimize the patient dose. The aim of this study was to evaluate the awareness of <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners</b> in Isfahan about how to prescribe correct radiographs in 2010 - 2011. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive/cross-sectional study data was collected by distributing questionnaires among 400 <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners</b> in Isfahan. The questionnaire consisted of three parts, including a description of various radiographic techniques in the form of awareness questions. Awareness of <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners</b> was evaluated in 25 different fields, including correct prescription of radiographs. Data was analyzed and compared between the fields under study by one-way ANOVA and independent t-test (p value 0. 001). Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the awareness of <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners</b> in Isfahan about correct radiographic techniques is less than the acceptable level. Therefore, it is necessary to increase their knowledge and awareness by continuous education programs. Key words: Awareness, <b>Dental</b> <b>practitioners,</b> Radiograph...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the attitude and subjective norm of <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners</b> towards practicing the atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) in Tanzania. A pre-tested questionnaire on attitudes and subjective norms to practice ART was mailed to all 147 <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners</b> working in the regional and district government clinics. The independent variables were: gender, working experience, qualification and ever heard of ART. The dependent variables were: attitude, subjective norm and intention to practice ART. Chi-square tests and multiple regression analysis were used to test for effects between independent and dependent variables. Significance level was set at 5 %. A total of 138 practitioners returned completed questionnaires. More experienced <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners</b> encountered moderate social pressure than less experienced <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners,</b> who met strong social pressure (p= 0. 045). A total of 73. 2 % of <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners</b> felt that ART was worth introducing in Tanzania, 92. 8 % recommended ART training for all <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners</b> and 97. 8 % recommended inclusion of ART in dental curricula. Positive attitude, strong subjective norm and high intention to practice ART were recorded in 76. 3 %, 28. 1 % and 90. 6 % of the practitioners, respectively. Only subjective norm had a statistically significant influence on the intention to practice ART (p< 0. 0001). The results indicated that <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners</b> were willing to have ART introduced in Tanzania and had positive attitudes towards practicing this technique. Nevertheless, their intention to perform ART was strongly influenced by social pressures.

Materials and Methods: The study was a quantitative, cross-sectional type. A sample size of 200 <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners</b> were included in the study between the period of 6 months, i. e. June–December. A cluster sampling technique was employed covering four different dental institutes. A structured questionnaire was designed to assess the perception and understanding of <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners</b> in providing treatment to the pregnant women. Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 19. Chi-square test was done to analyze the association of perception of <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners</b> in treating pregnant women in relation to gender. Results: A total of 200 <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners</b> filled the questionnaire out of which 43 % (86) were males and 57 % (114) were females. Eighty-two percent of the total participants said that it is safe to provide dental treatment during pregnancy, almost 90. 4 % of the total dentist interviewed was aware of the special position in which to place a pregnant woman on a dental chair. 85. 5 % of the study population do not prefer taking radiographs of a pregnant woman, 63 % of the entire dentist surveyed prefers to use local anesthesia before any dental procedure on a pregnant patient. 96. 5 % care to educate their pregnant patient about improving dental health care. 59. 5 % of the <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners</b> said that they would consult the patient's gynecologist as a mandatory requirement before treating the patient. 57 % of the <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners</b> answered with gingivitis. 70. 5 % agreed on scaling.

Excessive lateral force can be corrected by holding the toothbrush in a pen grasp or by using the non-dominant hand to brush.

50|$|Dental {{attrition}} {{is a type}} of tooth wear {{caused by}} tooth-to-tooth contact, resulting in loss of tooth tissue, usually starting at the incisal or occlusal surfaces. Tooth wear is a physiological process and is commonly seen as a normal part of aging. Advanced and excessive wear and tooth surface loss can be defined as pathological in nature, requiring intervention by a <b>dental</b> <b>practitioner.</b> The pathological wear of the tooth surface can be caused by bruxism, which is clenching and grinding of the teeth. If the attrition is severe, the enamel can be completely worn away leaving underlying dentin exposed, resulting in an increased risk of dental caries and dentin hypersensitivity. It is best to identify pathological attrition at an early stage to prevent unnecessary loss of tooth structure as enamel does not regenerate.|$|E

Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study knowledge of <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners</b> working in Bushehr about infection control in dental radiography was evaluated by a specially designed questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed during continuous education conferences and was directly handed in to <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners</b> in their offices. A total of 47 <b>dental</b> <b>practitioners</b> were evaluated. Data was analyzed by descriptive statistical methods in the form of scores ranging from 0 to 100. Results: A total of 74. 5 % of those surveyed in the study were male and 25. 5 % were female. The awareness scores in relation to infection transmission pathways, infective fluids, AIDS transmission pathways, and unhealthy behaviors were higher than average. The awareness scores in relation to covering of the hands, environmental factors, how to wear new gloves, and disinfection of the hands were below average.
