500|$|De Havilland {{was praised}} for her {{performance}} as Virginia Cunningham in Anatole Litvak's drama The Snake Pit (1948), {{one of the}} first films to attempt a realistic portrayal of mental illness and an important exposé of the harsh conditions in state mental hospitals, according to film critic Philip French. Based on a novel by Mary Jane Ward and produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, the film is about a woman placed in a mental institution by her husband to help her recover from a nervous breakdown. Virginia Cunningham {{was one of the most}} difficult of all her film roles, requiring significant preparation both mentally and physicallyshe deliberately lost weight to help create her gaunt appearance on screen. She consulted regularly with psychiatrists hired as consultants for the film, and visited Camarillo State Mental Hospital to research her role and observe the patients. The extreme physical discomfort of the hydrotherapy and simulated <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> <b>therapy</b> scenes were especially challenging for the slight [...] actress. In her performance, she conveyed her mental anguish by physically transforming her face with furrowed brow, wild staring eyes, and grimacing mouth.|$|E
500|$|Three {{classes of}} {{electrotherapy}} were in use. [...] One was the electric bath, {{which consisted of}} sitting the patient on an insulated stool with glass legs and connecting the patient to one electrode, usually the positive one, of an electrostatic machine. [...] The patient's skin became charged as {{if he or she}} were in a [...] "bath of electricity". [...] The second class of treatment could be performed while the patient was in the electric bath. [...] This consisted of bringing a negative electrode close to the patient, usually near the spine, causing sparks to be produced between the electrode and the patient. [...] Electrodes of various shapes were available for different medical purposes and places of application on the body. [...] Treatment was applied in several sessions of around five minutes, often blistering the skin. [...] The third class of treatment was <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> <b>therapy,</b> in which an electric shock was delivered from a galvanic battery (later electromagnetic generators) via an induction coil to greatly increase the voltage. [...] It was also possible to deliver electric shocks from the charge stored in a Leyden jar, but this was a much weaker shock.Simpson, pp. 7–8Morus, pp. 235–236 ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Simultaneous {{bilateral}} femoral neck fracture is {{an uncommon}} condition. There {{are very few}} cases {{reported in the literature}} and most of these cases have underlying bone pathologies such as renal osteodystrophy and osteomalacia. In some cases bilateral femoral neck fractures occur due to generalized seizures or high-energy trauma. Presentation of case: In this case report “atraumatic bilateral femoral neck fracture in a 26  year old woman in postpartum period with hypophosphatemic rickets disease” is presented. Discussion: Femoral neck fractures are more frequently seen in elderly because of the reduction of bone quality and developing osteoporosis. In the literature generalized epilepsy, osteomalacia, hypovitaminosis D and chronic renal failure are shown as facilitating causes of bilateral femoral neck fractures. In patients without any additional pathology <b>electric</b> <b>shock,</b> electroconvulsive <b>therapy,</b> and high-energy trauma can lead to femoral neck fractures. In our patient there was also an underlying pathology, she has been followed due to autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets disease since she was one year old. In the treatment of bilateral femoral neck fractures open/closed reduction internal fixation or hip arthroplasty are applied. Conclusion: For patients with bone metabolic diseases and/or the patients in pregnancy and postpartum period, preventive measures should be increased {{to reduce the risk of}} pathologic fracture. Admitting to the hospital physicians must be more careful about detecting fractures in these patients...|$|R

They chastised themselves for their inaction all the decades bafter.
