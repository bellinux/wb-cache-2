5|$|In 1915, a new Mint director, Robert W. Woolley, took office. Woolley {{advocated}} {{the replacement of}} the silver coins when it was legal to do so, and instructed Barber and Morgan to prepare new designs. He consulted with the Commission of Fine Arts, asking them to examine the designs produced by the Mint's engravers and, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> they were not suitable, to recommend artists to design the new coins. The Commission rejected the Barber and Morgan designs and proposed Adolph Weinman, Hermon MacNeil, and Albin Polasek as designers. Although Woolley had hoped that each artist would produce one design, different concepts by Weinman were accepted for the dime and half dollar, and one by MacNeil for the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Sex {{therapist}} Ruth Westheimer {{said the}} device was most favored by those selecting from vibrators of the corded electrical variety. Therapist and sex educator Laura Berman recommended the device in many articles for the Chicago Sun-Times, both for women who had never experienced an orgasm {{and those who had}} difficulty becoming aroused. Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth about Sex, a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that the Magic Wand was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian clinical psychologist and sex therapist Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using the Magic Wand while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse. Physician and sex columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the Magic Wand in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device. Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists.|$|E

25|$|Following the game's release, {{some of the}} {{alternative}} outfits for characters had come under criticism for using cultural stereotypes, such as a Native American headdress option for the character of Pharah, {{who seemed to be}} primarily of Egyptian origin. Kaplan noted that they considered for all these outfits if they were appropriate, believing they were respecting the cultures of the characters they had created, and would make necessary changes <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> there were valid concerns. Kaplan commented that many players have responded positively to these outfits and feel they fit in appropriately with the idealized version of Earth. Later game developments showed that Pharah was actually set out as a half-Egyptian/half-Native American character, making such outfits appropriate in hindsight.|$|E

And so their final two concerts at the Luna Park Arena took place on September 5 of that year, the most {{important}} acoustic rock band saying good-bye to 30,000 people. Historians have come to see the Sui Generis farewell concerts as the end of the 'Classic' Argentine rock era. Acoustic rock was passing into history: bands dissolved, changed their sound, and those that remained lost popularity and became only cult followings. Argentine progressive rock was on the rise, and so was the political repression to freedoms of expression. Also, several bands would leave the country for greener pastures in Europe, mostly Spain, among them Moris and Aquelarre.|$|E

Opposing the name change, The Saturn Cafe in Santa Cruz, California changed their menu to [...] "Impeach George W. Bush fries". Meanwhile Reckitt Benckiser, maker of French's mustard, were sufficiently concerned about the movement to publicly clarify that its brand derived from a family name.|$|E
500|$|Prior to 2009, the Nebula Awards {{employed}} a rolling eligibility system. Each work was eligible {{to qualify for}} the ballot for one year following its date of publication. As a consequence of rolling eligibility, there was the possibility for works to be nominated in the calendar year after their publication and then be awarded in the calendar year after that. Works were added to a preliminary list for the year if they had ten or more nominations, which were then voted on to create the final ballot. In 1970, the option was added for voters to select [...] "no award" [...] <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that no nominated work was worthy of winning; this happened in 1971 in the Short Story category and in 1977 in the Script category.|$|E
500|$|The art {{style for}} the game {{was based on the}} work of Frank Frazetta and {{inspired}} by heavy metal and rock album covers. The team only considered the addition of elements to the artwork <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> it would be something that could be seen on such covers. The setting includes hot rod-like engines that grow from the earth like a [...] "V8 Truffle Of Speed", with design inspired by the designs of Ed [...] "Big Daddy" [...] Roth. The art team wanted to avoid creating [...] "another brown-gray game", and strove to use the wide color palettes that are associated with heavy metal art.

[...] O'Donnell began work on Reach while ODST, for which he also wrote the music, was still in production, but did not begin composing until August 2009. Past Halo collaborators Salvatori, C. Paul Johnson, and Stan LePard assisted O'Donnell. With Reach, he did not give them strictly divided responsibilities. [...] "I decided this time {{to come up with some}} themes, tempos, keys, and other basic starting points for musical ideas," [...] explained O'Donnell. [...] "I shared these with all the other composers and just asked them to take off <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> inspired by any of that material."

In El Salvador they met members of the Comité de Madres Monsignor Romero (COMADRES: Committee of the Mothers Monsignor Romero), an organization of women whose children were forcibly disappeared by the Salvadoran government during the Civil War because they opposed the military regime that was in power. At one point during the trip, Bono, Alison, {{and a member of}} CAMP were shot at by government troops while on their way to deliver aid to a group of farmers.

Despite improved sales with their second Capitol album, the group's relationship with the label was increasingly troubled. A planned 1998 project, After the Astronaut, was scrapped and Butthole Surfers acrimoniously split with their manager, Tom Bunch. In 1999, Butthole Surfers won their lawsuit against Touch and Go. Despite the outcome, several of Butthole Surfers' peers in the alternative music community, including Fugazi and Minor Threat lead singer Ian MacKaye, criticized them for having pursued the lawsuit. Haynes and others said they wouldn't have initiated the proceedings <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> Rusk's dealings had been honorable.

One of the lines of attack used against Wheelwright was {{identifying}} his doctrine, and that of Cotton, as being [...] "False Doctrine" [...] because of its difference from that {{of all of the}} other New England ministers. Cotton's angry response to this was, [...] "Brother Wheelwright's Doctrine was according to God," [...] letting the court know that by going after Wheelwright they were going after him as well, and this essentially ended that line of attack.

Following an evening to discuss this among themselves, the ministers returned to the court the next day.

In a typical DRM experiment, a subject listens to a list of related words, for example; Thread, Pin, Eye, Sewing, Sharp, Point, Prick, Thimble, Haystack, Torn, Hurt, Injection, Syringe, Cloth, Knitting, and is then tested on their memory for this list. Typically, subjects will recall or recognise an associated, but unpresented lure word (Needle).
