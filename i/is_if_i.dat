When asked by chat-show host Larry King in 2003, how life was with McCartney, Mills replied [...] "Great, really great", but also {{said that she}} was surprised at how tidy McCartney was: [...] "He always cleans up before the cleaner comes. So I said for a while that's crazy, but what's good <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> cook the dinner, he'll clean everything up." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{component}} of the radial velocity observed through line broadening depends on the inclination of the star's pole {{to the line of}} sight. The derived value is given as , where ve is the rotational velocity at the equator and i is the inclination. However, i is not always known, so the result gives a minimum value for the star's rotational velocity. That <b>is,</b> <b>if</b> <b>i</b> is not a right angle, then the actual velocity is greater than [...] This is sometimes referred to as the projected rotational velocity. In fast rotating stars polarimetry offers a method of recovering the actual velocity rather than just the rotational velocity; this technique has so far been applied only to Regulus.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of his 2002 {{documentary}} Spellbound, Jeffrey Blitz was encouraged by his agents to write fiction because of the larger revenue brought in by fiction films. Blitz began to piece together a story that had come to him while he had been filming Spellbound: [...] "I kept thinking, what if we met a kid that was just an amazing lover of words? What if we met a kid that was lured into the spelling bee because {{he was in love with}} a girl?" [...] He had compiled a mental list of characters who he expected to encounter while making Spellbound, several of whom eventually became Rocket Science characters. Despite claiming to be [...] "allergic" [...] to autobiographical films, he was persuaded by HBO executive Maud Nadler to write a screenplay based on his own adolescence when he told her that, as a teenager, he joined his school's debate team to try and overcome his stutter. He says that he is uninterested in teen films, so [...] "the only way I was going to do a teen movie <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> felt like I could try to be more honest about what the actual experience of being a teenager is like." [...] He was aware of the clichés in teen films, so [...] "tried to undo them without wrecking them". Blitz wrote the script [...] "off and on" [...] over a year in between stints of commercial directing. He cites directors Hal Ashby and Billy Wilder as his greatest influences with their absurdist comedies, though critics have suggested influence from Gary Larson, Alexander Payne, Mike Nichols and Wes Anderson—the latter despite Blitz specifically saying, [...] "I did not want a Wes Andersen [...] snowglobe artificial world." ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 18, 2007, Arar spoke via video-link {{before the}} House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights and Oversight, and the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties {{at a hearing}} that is {{examining}} his case {{and the practice of}} rendition. In his statement to the committee, he detailed his experiences and expressed his hope that his case will not be repeated. [...] "I now understand how fragile our human rights and freedoms are, and how easily they can be taken from us by the very same governments and institutions that have sworn to protect us. I also know that the only way I {{will ever be able to}} move on in my life and have a future <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can find out why this happened to me, and help prevent it from happening to others." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shapira Bar-Or {{and fellow}} Israeli swimmer Jowan Qupty, {{who is a}} Christian Israeli Arab, {{had known each other}} when they were children, and swum {{together}} for the Jerusalem United swim club in Israel. [...] They attended The Bolles School, in Jacksonville, Florida, together. [...] There they were roommates for two years, swim team teammates, and became best friends. [...] Qupty's father, commenting on the friendship and teamwork between his Christian Arab Israeli son and his son's Jewish Israeli roommate/teammate, said: [...] "Just to see them together after the race jumping and hugging each other; they were so happy. I was looking at them through my tears. Coming from our part of the world, you don't see that." [...] The younger Qupty observed that [...] "people were amazed all the time" [...] that he – a Palestinian – and a Jew could coexist, and Shapira Bar-Or said: [...] "It shows how simple the situation <b>is.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> can live with a Palestinian guy, I'm sure in our country we can live with a couple millions of Palestinians and Israelis together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cleverly {{earned the}} interim {{version of the}} belt on 11 December 2010 in an unimpressive contest with the Frenchman Nadjib Mohammedi at the Echo Arena in Liverpool. Winning 115–112, 116–111 and 115–113 on the {{scorecards}} despite also having a point deducted Cleverly described his opponent as [...] "very awkward" [...] and said [...] "he was making me miss and dragging me in {{but this is the}} way it goes sometimes." [...] Cleverly had fought for the interim title as the full champion Jürgen Brähmer was in the midst of an appeal against a 16-month jail sentence for assault and insulting behaviour. An appeal heard in Germany on 13 December 2010 would, if Brähmer had been unsuccessful and sent to prison, have resulted in the belt being vacated and Cleverly being upgraded to the full champion status. Proceedings however didn't result in the champion being sent to prison and a fight with Brähmer was scheduled for 21 May 2011 Speaking of the match up Cleverly said that he was glad that it was going to happen saying [...] "He's the champion and the only way I would consider myself a true champion <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> took the belt from him, rather than picking up the vacant title." ...|$|E
