In 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered a 3Kelvin background hiss in their Bell Labs radiotelescope (the Holmdel <b>Horn</b> <b>Antenna),</b> which was evidence for this hypothesis, and formed the basis for a number of results that helped determine the age of the universe.|$|E
25|$|Working at Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey, in 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were {{experimenting with}} a supersensitive, 6 meter (20ft) <b>horn</b> <b>antenna</b> {{originally}} built to detect radio waves bounced off Echo balloon satellites. To measure these faint radio waves, they had to eliminate all recognizable interference from their receiver. They removed the effects of radar and radio broadcasting, and suppressed interference from the heat in the receiver itself by cooling it with liquid helium to 269°C, only 4 K above absolute zero.|$|E
25|$|When {{a friend}} (Bernard F. Burke, Prof. of Physics at MIT) told Penzias about a {{preprint}} paper {{he had seen}} by Jim Peebles {{on the possibility of}} finding radiation left over from an explosion that filled the universe at the beginning of its existence, Penzias and Wilson began to realize the significance of their discovery. The characteristics of the radiation detected by Penzias and Wilson fit exactly the radiation predicted by Robert H. Dicke and his colleagues at Princeton University. Penzias called Dicke at Princeton, who immediately sent him a copy of the still-unpublished Peebles paper. Penzias read the paper and called Dicke again and invited him to Bell Labs to look at the <b>horn</b> <b>antenna</b> and listen to the background noise. Dicke, Peebles, Wilkinson and P. G. Roll interpreted this radiation as a signature of the Big Bang.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>horn</b> <b>antenna</b> or {{microwave}} horn is {{an antenna}} {{that consists of}} a flaring metal waveguide shaped like a horn to direct radio waves in a beam. [...] Horns are widely used as antennas at UHF and microwave frequencies, above 300MHz. [...] They are used as feed antennas (called feed horns) for larger antenna structures such as parabolic antennas, as standard calibration antennas to measure the gain of other antennas, and as directive antennas for such devices as radar guns, [...] automatic door openers, [...] and microwave radiometers. [...] Their advantages are moderate directivity, low standing wave ratio (SWR), broad bandwidth, and simple construction and adjustment.|$|E
2500|$|Barrow {{had become}} {{interested}} in high frequencies in 1930 studying under Arnold Sommerfeld in Germany.

He also got a British patent on September 23, 1904 for a full radar system, that he called a telemobiloscope. It operated on a 50cm wavelength and the pulsed radar signal was created via a spark-gap.

2500|$|A type of antenna that {{combines}} a horn with a parabolic reflector {{is known as}} a Hogg-horn, or horn-reflector antenna, invented by [...] Alfred C. Beck and Harald T. Friis in 1941 [...] and further developed by David C. Hogg at Bell labs in 1961. [...] It is also referred to as the [...] "sugar scoop" [...] due to its characteristic shape. [...] It consists of a <b>horn</b> <b>antenna</b> with a reflector mounted in the mouth of the horn at a 45 degree angle so the radiated beam is at right angles to the horn axis. [...] The reflector is a segment of a parabolic reflector, and the focus of the reflector is at the apex of the horn, [...] so the device is equivalent to a parabolic antenna fed off-axis. [...] The advantage of this design over a standard parabolic antenna is that the horn shields the antenna from radiation coming from angles outside the main beam axis, so its radiation pattern has very small sidelobes. [...] Also, the aperture isn't partially obstructed by the feed and its supports, as with ordinary front-fed parabolic dishes, allowing it to achieve aperture efficiencies of 70% [...] as opposed to 55-60% for front-fed dishes. The disadvantage is that it is far larger and heavier for a given aperture area than a parabolic dish, and must be mounted on a cumbersome turntable to be fully steerable. [...] This design was used for a few radio telescopes and communication satellite ground antennas during the 1960s. [...] Its largest use, however, was as fixed antennas for microwave relay links in the AT Long Lines microwave network. [...] Since the 1970s this design has been superseded by shrouded parabolic dish antennas, which can achieve equally good sidelobe performance with a lighter more compact construction. [...] Probably the most photographed and well-known example is the 15 meter (50foot) long Holmdel <b>Horn</b> <b>Antenna</b> at Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey, with which Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered cosmic microwave background radiation in 1965, for which they won the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics. [...] Another more recent horn-reflector design is the cass-horn, which is a combination of a horn with a cassegrain parabolic antenna using two reflectors.|$|E
