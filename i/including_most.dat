5|$|Frequent {{cyclones}} also pose a threat, {{particularly to}} concentrated or small populations. In late January 1997, Cyclone Gretelle destroyed 80% of the Manombo forest canopy. With their habitat, <b>including</b> <b>most</b> of their food resources, effectively destroyed, the ruffed lemurs {{of the forest}} broadened their diet, remaining surprisingly frugivorous. Their body weights dropped and no births were reported for four years, but they managed to stave off starvation. This event demonstrated not only their flexibility {{in the face of}} natural disasters, which may highlight the evolutionary reasons behind their reproductive capacity and litter size, but also the threat faced by already stressed populations.|$|E
5|$|Frogs and toads are broadly {{classified}} into three suborders: Archaeobatrachia, which includes four families of primitive frogs; Mesobatrachia, which includes five families of more evolutionary intermediate frogs; and Neobatrachia, {{by far the}} largest group, which contains the remaining 24 families of modern frogs, <b>including</b> <b>most</b> common species throughout the world. The Neobatrachia suborder is further divided into the two superfamilies Hyloidea and Ranoidea. This classification is based on such morphological features as the number of vertebrae, the structure of the pectoral girdle, and the morphology of tadpoles. While this classification is largely accepted, relationships among families of frogs are still debated.|$|E
