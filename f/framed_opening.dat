Martin House, {{is perhaps}} most {{remarkable}} for its two stone veneered sections framing a central pavilion-like center of transparent glass walls, allowing visitors to actually see through the building itself to the lake beyond, revolutionary for a 1926 design. [...] It also features spacious cantilevered balconies, expansive terraces, and “ribbons” of windows that allow the experience of nature from within and through the house.

60|$|But {{during the}} night the carpenter, without at all trying to {{approach}} the pump, had managed to creep quietly along the starboard bulwark, and, unseen, had crouched down right under Falk's deck port. When daylight came he rose up suddenly, looked in, and putting his arm through the round brass <b>framed</b> <b>opening,</b> fired at Falk within a foot. He missed--and Falk, instead of attempting to seize the arm holding the weapon, opened his door unexpectedly, and with the muzzle of his long revolver nearly touching the other's side, shot him dead.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the behaviour of hybrid reinforced concrete frame with pumice brick masonry infill under static lateral loading. The term hybrid herein is referred to the frame composed of precast block masonry unit and cast in-place reinforced concrete beams. Parameters considered in this study were <b>frame</b> <b>opening</b> representing doors and windows commonly used in the wall system. Six types of frame namely FS, FB, FDE, FDC, FWE and FWC designation for solid frame, bare frame, <b>frame</b> with door <b>opening</b> at edge, <b>frame</b> with door <b>opening</b> at centre, <b>frame</b> with window <b>opening</b> at edge and <b>frame</b> with window <b>opening</b> at centre respectively were considered. Test results indicated that the FS has a maximum lateral strength greater than that of FB. The lateral strength of FS was about 3. 68 of FB. The <b>frames</b> with various <b>openings</b> have lateral strength nearly 2. 3 of lateral strength of the bare frame, FB. Ductility factor of the frames varied from 2. 4 to 4. 92. The residual strength of the <b>frame</b> with <b>openings</b> were varies between 2. 33 and 3. 35 of the bare frame. The stiffness of the infilled <b>frames</b> with <b>opening</b> were varied from 3. 56 to 3. 67 of the bare frame. The presence of openings in the infilled frame did not affect the frame stiffness considerably...|$|R
50|$|C Block, {{one of the}} {{original}} ward blocks, is not immediately recognisable as a nineteenth century building, as the two storeyed verandahs surrounding the building have been infilled with a s brick envelope through which aluminium <b>framed</b> <b>openings</b> are punched. The complex hipped roof of {{the original}} structure is evident above these verandahs and this retains an early corrugated iron cladding.|$|R

50|$|The {{internal}} altar area {{is expressed}} externally {{on the eastern}} facade, facing Cook Street with a smaller gabled projecting section. This gabled section is dominated by a large pointed arched timber <b>framed</b> <b>opening</b> filled with amber coloured glass. The window provides lighting to the altar which is at {{this end of the}} building. The northern side of the building is lined with a recent wide timber framed verandah.|$|E
50|$|In the garret, {{the stair}} rises into an {{unheated}} central space {{the width of}} the passage below. To the east and west are heated chambers with simple transitional Georgian / Federal chimney pieces. The central space is lighted by one dormer window on the north wall. This gabled dormer was reconstructed in the 1970s within the original <b>framed</b> <b>opening.</b> The reconstruction is probably inaccurate; the original probably had a shed roof. The chambers are lighted only by pairs of casement windows with their original hinges {{on either side of the}} chimneys.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is constructed with an in situ cast post tensioned concrete frame sits {{on top of}} piled foundations with Precast brickwork spandrels and columns <b>frame</b> <b>openings.</b> The exterior walls are aluminium curtain walling, with timber windows, external rendering, timber and rain screen cladding. The building can hold 500 people and makes the most of a small site. There is car parking {{to the rear of}} the building and there is also a multi-storey car park (shared with Endeavour House) with access from Constantine Road.|$|R
50|$|The western {{elevation}} {{has a large}} feature {{window with}} eight rectangular timber <b>framed</b> <b>openings,</b> divided into three levels by different types of windows. The bottom level has casements; the second level has pivoting windows and the top level has fixed windows which slope in an easterly direction toward the main room of the building. At {{the top of the}} windows, between them and on the outer wall is a panel of mesh. The window is surmounted by a timber framed hood clad with corrugated iron.|$|R

50|$|The front central space, {{formerly}} the public office, features a crows ash and ironbark timber floor forming a striped pattern. Walls are finished with hard-set plaster. Ceilings are also finished with plaster and are adorned with ornate plaster cornices and panels featuring geometric designs. Multi-paned skylights with coloured glass have been inserted where early pendant lights remain. Skirting boards and architraves are varnished silky oak. Several internal windows and openings {{are located in}} this room. One is a timber <b>framed</b> <b>opening</b> to the teller's booth set into the wall and features a metal grille. Others are leadlight glazing.|$|E

5000|$|The eastern (receiving) igloo is {{approximately}} 10 m long x 6 m wide. Along {{the base of}} the north-east side wall (rear) of the igloo is a small timber <b>framed</b> <b>opening.</b> There is an opening on the southern side, approximately 2 m wide, which would have been the door. The door is no longer extant. Anecdotal evidence indicates that the door was staggered ie. enter one side, walk around one partition, and then another, like an s-bend, to ensure that light was contained inside the igloo at all times. This would also have provided a constant flow of air into the igloo, which was then drawn through the igloo by an exhaust fan situated in the tower. There is a square steel box on top of the tower inscribed with the words [...] "A & W... & Co LTD ENGINNEERS GLASGOW". It is not known what this was use for. The interior of the igloo is bare, except for a modern lounge chair and some rubbish.|$|E

50|$|Qasr al-‘Ishshah {{exhibits}} some of {{the finest}} examples of lime plaster decoration (malas) in Tarim. The decorative program of the exterior south façade finds its antecedents in Mughal royal architecture, as well as the colonial forms of the Near East, South Asia and Southeast Asia. Interior stucco decoration differs from room to room, including Art Nouveau, Rococo, Neo-Classical and combinations of the three. The ornamentation often incorporates pilasters along the walls <b>framing</b> <b>openings,</b> built-in cabinetry with skilled wood carvings, elaborate column capitals, decorated ceilings, niches and kerosene lamp holders, as well as complex color schemes.|$|R
50|$|Susanka has {{proposed}} {{an approach to}} housing that values quality over quantity. She outlines a design language for homeowners, builders and architects {{that is based on}} architectural elements such as <b>framed</b> <b>openings</b> (windows, doors or doorways that are framed or nested in certain ways), spatial layering, visual weight, diagonal views, and variations to ceiling height, all of which are intended to let the interior of a house feel comfortable and more spacious. They are tools used to create a subjective feeling of separation and shelteredness, yet interconnection with other parts of the house.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} facades of {{the rectangular}} planned building are elaborate essays in classical architecture, comprising five bays {{on the long}} side, addressing Richmond Street, and three bays to the shorter Kent Street elevation. The bays of the building are defined by double storeyed height pilasters with Corinthian order capitals which are square planned, except those flanking the Kent Street entrance that are round planned. The square planned columns are paired flanking the central Richmond Street bay. The pilasters support a detailed entablature with a projecting cornice with stylised Corinthian order detailing, including dentil mouldings and modillions (or small scrolled bracket giving the impression of supporting another projecting moulded band of the cornice). Surmounting the cornice of the building is an Italianate parapet, formed by a balustrade of elongated urns separated with panels aligned with the pilasters {{on the face of}} the building. On the parapet over the two central bays are flat rendered brick panels. The principal entrance to the building, from Kent Street, is through an aedicule or <b>framed</b> <b>opening</b> comprising two columns supporting a round headed pediment. More simple versions of these openings line ground floor in each of the other bays, although the smaller versions do not support a pediment, only an entablature. Above these openings are first floor window openings which are surrounded by architraves. At the corners of the buildings these openings have a blank Italianate balustrade at base level and are surmounted by triangular pediments. The openings in the central bays of each elevation are surmounted by round arched pediments, similar to those in the central bays of the ground floor.|$|E

It is shown that the use of polyurethane foam adhesive to bond the concrete blocks in the masonry walls is technically and economically feasible. On the basis of the tests it was concluded that the laying of concrete blocks on the polyurethane adhesive may be used in the construction of non-load bearing interior and exterior walls of buildings, including the filling of the external <b>frame</b> <b>openings</b> of monolithic buildings with floor bearing of the masonry on load bearing monolithic floors (with appropriate justification of the settlement) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{relatively}} low facades stand out {{due to their}} large vertical windows finished with semi-circular arches. Above these, a kind of pediment with an accented trim and a lintel closes the space. Under all this, a flat base where the brick is hidden, decorated with low arch <b>frames</b> simulating <b>openings</b> (some of them really are bays), “supports” {{the rest of the}} entire facade.|$|R
50|$|The former Council Chambers is {{a single}} storeyed, hip roofed {{building}} with a basement. The external walls are brick with contrasting rendered elements including linear banding and ornamental <b>framing</b> around <b>openings.</b> Two entry porches of different design and materials to distinguish the former public entry and the former main entry, are located at {{the northern and southern}} ends of the building respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is two stories high, with a projecting mass {{at the center}} of the principal façade. Tuscan pilasters, of the giant order (banked on a base), <b>frame</b> the <b>openings.</b> The wide windows of the lower floor have a simple horizontal dustguard, which becomes concave at its lower ends. Over the pilasters is an entablature, with a frieze of triglyphs and, below them, three guttae.|$|R
5000|$|Accidents {{most often}} occur in {{collisions}} with other off-road vehicles, and are frequently {{the result of}} not being seen. In many dune areas, all sand vehicles (motorcycles, quads, sandrails,UTVs and sandcars) are required to use an eight-foot antenna whip and flag. This is critical to being seen by other vehicles as a driver traverses from one dune to the next. Most sandrails employ a variety of safety features for the driver and passengers. The most common {{is the use of}} a three-point safety belt system. Many sand rails also utilize roll bar padding and fire extinguishers. More advanced safety features sometimes include: arm and wrist restraints, netting for large <b>frame</b> <b>openings,</b> automatic fuel cut-off switches and horns. Additionally, the use of eye protection (goggles and ballistic-grade glasses) is considered a necessity. Finally, the use of helmets while [...] "duning" [...] is increasing due to the advances in performance. Sand associations along with state and federal land management agencies work to provide dune safety information through pamphlets, online and in classes.|$|R
