25|$|Ringbone is <b>exostosis</b> (bone growth) in the pastern or coffin {{joint of}} a horse. In severe cases, the growth can {{encircle}} the bones, giving ringbone its name.

25|$|Markers of {{occupational}} stress, which include morphological {{changes to the}} skeleton and dentition as well as joint changes at specific locations have also been widely used to infer specific (rather than general) activities. Such markers are often based on single cases described in clinical literature {{in the late nineteenth}} century. One such marker {{has been found to be}} a reliable indicator of lifestyle: the external auditory <b>exostosis</b> also called surfer's ear, which is a small bony protuberance in the ear canal which occurs in those working in proximity to cold water.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Bruce Rothschild {{and others}} {{published}} a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs {{and the implications}} for their behavior. They found that {{only one of the}} 319 Albertosaurus foot bones checked for stress fractures actually had them and none of the four hand bones did. The scientists found that stress fractures were [...] "significantly" [...] less common in Albertosaurus than in the carnosaur Allosaurus. ROM 807, the holotype of A. arctunguis (now referred to A. sarcophagus), had a [...] deep hole in the iliac blade, although the describer of the species did not recognize this as pathological. The specimen also contains some <b>exostosis</b> on the fourth left metatarsal. In 1970, two of the five Albertosaurus sarcophagus specimens with humeri were reported by Dale Russel as having pathological damage to them.|$|E
500|$|Most of the pathologies {{occurred}} on the vertebrae. For example, a dorsal (back) vertebra from a juvenile animal showed an <b>exostosis</b> (bony growth) on its underside. The growth probably resulted from the conversion of cartilage or a ligament to bone during development, but {{the cause of the}} ossification was not determined. Hypervitaminosis A and bone spurs were ruled out, and an osteoma (benign bone tumor) was deemed unlikely. Another specimen, a small caudal (tail) vertebra, was also found to have an abnormal growth, this time on the top of its neural spine, which projects upwards from the vertebrae, allowing muscle attachment. Similar growths from the neural spine have been found in specimens of Allosaurus and Masiakasaurus, probably resulting from the ossification of a ligament running either between the neural spines [...] (interspinal ligament) or along their tops (supraspinal ligament).|$|E
500|$|Other pathologies {{reported}} in Allosaurus include: Willow breaks in two ribs. Healed fractures in the humerus and radius. Distortion of joint surfaces {{in the foot}} possibly due to osteoarthritis or developmental issues. Osteopetrosis along the endosteal surface of a tibia. Distortions of the joint surfaces of the tail vertebrae possibly due to osetoarthritis or developmental issues. [...] "xtensive 'neoplastic' ankylosis of caudals," [...] possibly due to physical trauma {{as well as the}} fusion of chevrons to centra. Coossification of vertebral centra {{near the end of the}} tail. Amputation of a chevron and foot bone, both possibly a result of bites. [...] "xtensive exostoses" [...] in the first phalanx of the third toe. Lesions similar to those caused by osteomyelitis in two scapulae. Bone spurs in a premaxilla, ungual, and two metacarpals. <b>Exostosis</b> in a pedal phalanx possibly attributable to an infectious disease. A metacarpal with a round depressed fracture.|$|E
500|$|Members of {{both sexes}} possessed a large {{tuberous}} knob of bone <b>exostosis</b> situated {{at the base of}} the carpometacarpus of each wrist. Other wing bones also sometimes show similar structures. The knob was cauliflower-like in appearance, and consisted of up to two or three lobes. The knobs were about half the length of the metacarpus, were larger in males than females, and described as the size of a musket ball. One study measured the largest knob to be [...] in diameter. The knobs vary in size across individuals, and were entirely absent from 58% of specimens examined for the study. These are thought to be immature birds, or birds without territory. The carpometacarpi of males without the knobs were smaller on average than those with it, but there was little difference between the females. In life, the knobs would have been covered by tough cartilaginous or keratinous integument, which would have made them appear even larger. Carpal spurs and knobs are also known from other extant as well as extinct birds. Within Columbidae, the crowned pigeons and the Viti Levu giant pigeon have outgrowths on the carpometacarpus which are similar to those of the female Rodrigues solitaire. Other well known examples are the steamer ducks, the torrent duck, sheathbills, screamers, the spur-winged goose, and the extinct Xenicibis xympithecus.|$|E

5000|$|A buccal <b>exostosis</b> (also termed {{alveolar}} <b>exostosis),</b> is an <b>exostosis</b> (bone prominence) on the buccal surface (cheek side) of the alveolar {{ridge of}} the maxilla or mandible. Some consider them {{a variation of}} normal anatomy rather than a disease.|$|E
50|$|Evidence for <b>exostosis</b> {{found in}} the fossil record is studied by paleopathologists, specialists in ancient disease and injury. <b>Exostosis</b> has been {{reported}} in dinosaur fossils from several species, including Acrocanthosaurus atokensis, Albertosaurus sarcophagus, Allosaurus fragilis, Gorgosaurus libratus, and Poekilopleuron bucklandii.|$|E
50|$|<b>Exostosis,</b> or Surfer's ear, is a {{condition}} which affects people who spend large amounts of time in water in cold climates. In addition, wind may increase the prevalence {{of the amount of}} <b>exostosis</b> seen in one ear versus the other dependent on the direction it originates from and the orientation of the individual to the wind. Custom-fitted surfer's earplugs help reduce the amount of cold water and wind that is allowed to enter the external ear canal and, thus, help slow the progression of <b>exostosis.</b>|$|E

50|$|There are two types, {{longitudinal}} and transverse melanonychia.

One rib was broken and later healed by lengthening the shaft connecting it to its vertebra. The skull of the Acrocanthosaurus atokensis holotype shows some <b>exostosis</b> on the squamosal. Additionally, the neural spine of the eleventh vertebra was fractured and healed. The third tail vertebra bears a strange hook-shaped projection.|$|E
50|$|Irritation {{from cold}} {{wind and water}} {{exposure}} causes the bone surrounding the ear canal to develop lumps of new bony growth which constrict the ear canal. Where the ear canal is actually blocked by this condition, water and wax can become trapped and give rise to infection. The condition is so named due to its prevalence among cold water surfers. Warm water surfers are also at risk for <b>exostosis</b> due to the evaporative cooling caused by wind {{and the presence of}} water in the ear canal.|$|E

5000|$|A Poekilopleuron bucklandii {{individual}} preserves {{three different}} kinds of documented pathologies. The first is a tail vertebra with an <b>exostosis</b> ankylosing the chevron of one vertebra to the centrum of the next. The second is a phalanx, probably belonging to the animal's foot, that shows three low, irregular exostoses. Lastly, a phalanx that probably belong to the animal's hand exhibits a short round callus. A British bombing raid {{near the end of}} the Second World War destroyed the specimen, thus it is impossible to study the causes of these pathologies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{material}} of Poekilopleuron bucklandii includes two tail vertebrae with the chevron of one vertebra ankylosed to the centrum {{of the next}} within {{the development of an}} <b>exostosis.</b> Two phalanges also preserve pathologies. One probable pedal phalanx shows three low, irregular exostosis-like projections. A second probable manual phalanx exhibits a [...] "low rounded projection resembling a callus." [...] Ralph Molnar considered the occurrence of three pathologies in one individual to be [...] "noteworthy". Sadly the specimens cannot be examined further to determine the etiology of the pathologies because of their destruction during the British bombing raid in 1944.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>exostosis</b> (plural: exostoses) is the {{formation}} of new bone {{on the surface of}} a bone. Exostoses can cause chronic pain ranging from mild to debilitatingly severe, depending on the shape, size, and location of the lesion. It is most commonly found in places like the ribs, where small bone growths form, but sometimes larger growths can grow on places like the ankles, knees, shoulders, elbows and hips. Very rarely are they on the skull. They normally form on the bones of joints, and can grow upwards. For example, if an extra bone formed on the ankle, it might grow up to the shin.|$|E
5000|$|The {{deletion}} of {{this combination}} of genes results in several distinctive congenital features, occasional defects in the heart, kidneys, and urinary tract. The disorder is associated with an enlarged parietal foramina which can cause openings in the two bones that form the top and sides of the skull. These abnormal openings form extra [...] "soft spots" [...] on the head, {{in addition to the}} two that newborns normally have, and unlike the usual newborn soft spots, the enlarged parietal foramina remain open throughout life. Other signs can include multiple mostly noncancerous benign bone tumours called osteochondromas (<b>exostosis),</b> developmental delay, vision disorders and craniofacial abnormalities. It is classified as a rare disease.|$|E

5000|$|The album {{includes}} {{the work and}} sound of the Australian Concert orchestra on the songs [...] "Baby Don't Cry" [...] and [...] "Men and Women". [...] The band recorded both tracks live in the studio, with the 60-piece orchestra being conducted by Colin Piper and engineered by Neil Sandbach. For the opening track [...] "Questions", guitarist and saxophonist Kirk Pengilly used a brass horn to compose a Far East sound. Australian singer Deni Hines was hired to provide backing vocals on the album's third single [...] "Not Enough Time" [...] and [...] "Strange Desire". The singer {{would go on to}} marry Pengilly one year later. Tim Farriss was absent during most of the album's production having suffered with <b>exostosis.</b> Pengilly had to play most of his material. Pengilly himself was recovering from the end of a ten-year relationship. Other band members were also going through eventful experiences in their lives, including drummer Jon Farriss, who was preparing to marry his girlfriend at the time, Leslie Bega, whom he met the previous year in Los Angeles. Bassist Garry Gary Beers and his then-wife, Jodie, were awaiting the birth of their second child.
