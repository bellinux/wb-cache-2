50|$|The <b>eunuch</b> <b>flute,</b> or onion flute, or {{mirliton}} (Fr. flûte eunuque, flûte à l'oignon and mirliton; Ger. Zwiebelflöte) is {{a musical}} instrument of the woodwind family used during the 16th and 17th centuries, producing music akin to the comb-music of the nursery, and still manufactured as a toy ("mirliton").|$|E
5000|$|A flute {{is a type}} of aerophone, as is the <b>Eunuch</b> <b>flute,</b> also {{referred}} to as a mirliton. [...] A flute is an aerophone or reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening. According to the instrument classification of Hornbostel-Sachs, flutes are categorized as edge-blown aerophones. Aside from the voice, flutes are the earliest known musical instruments. A number of flutes dating to about 43,000 to 35,000 years ago have been found in the Swabian Alb region of Germany. These flutes demonstrate that a developed musical tradition existed from the earliest period of modern human presence in Europe.|$|E
50|$|The {{onion flute}} {{consists}} of a wooden tube widening out slightly to form a bell. The {{upper end of the}} tube is closed by means of a very fine membrane similar to an onion skin stretched across the aperture like the vellum of a drum. The mouthpiece, a simple round hole, is pierced a couple of inches below the membrane. Into this hole the performer sings, his voice setting up vibrations in the membrane (technically a mirliton), which thus intensifies the sound and changes its timbre to a bleating quality. A movable cap fits over the membrane to protect it. Marin Mersennus has given a drawing of the <b>eunuch</b> <b>flute</b> together with a description. He states that the vibrations of the membrane improve the sound of the voice, and by reflecting it, give it an added charm. There were concerts of these flutes in four or five parts in France, adds Mersennus, and they had the advantage over other kinds of reproducing more nearly the sound of the voice.|$|E
