5000|$|The {{principal}} design {{alternative to}} the twin-tube form has been the mono-tube shock absorber which was considered a revolutionary advancement when it appeared in the 1950s. As its name implies, the mono-tube shock, {{which is also a}} gas-pressurized shock and also comes in a coilover format, consists of only one tube, the pressure tube, though it has two pistons. These pistons are called the working piston and the dividing or floating piston, and they move in relative synchrony inside the pressure tube in response to changes in road smoothness. The two pistons also completely separate the shock's fluid and gas components. The mono-tube shock absorber is consistently a much longer overall design than the twin-tubes, making it difficult to mount in passenger cars designed for twin-tube shocks. However, unlike the twin-tubes, the mono-tube shock can be mounted either way— it does not have any directionality. [...] It also does not have a compression valve, whose role has been taken up by the <b>dividing</b> <b>piston,</b> and although it contains nitrogen gas, the gas in a mono-tube shock is under high pressure (260-360 p.s.i. or so) which can actually help it to support some of the vehicle's weight, something which no other shock absorber is designed to do.|$|E
40|$|The {{equilibrium}} conditions {{of a system}} consisting of a box with gas <b>divided</b> by a <b>piston</b> are revised. The apparent indetermination {{of the problem is}} solved by explicitly imposing the constancy of the internal energy when the Entropy Maximum Principle is applied. The equality of the pressures is naturally concluded from this principle when the piston is allowed to spontaneously move. The application of the Energy Minimum Principle is also revised.

50|$|Hydraulic {{cylinders}} {{get their}} power from pressurized hydraulic fluid, which is typically oil. The hydraulic cylinder {{consists of a}} cylinder barrel, in which a piston connected to a piston rod moves back and forth. The barrel is closed on one end by the cylinder bottom (also called the cap) and the other end by the cylinder head (also called the gland) where the piston rod {{comes out of the}} cylinder. The piston has sliding rings and seals. The <b>piston</b> <b>divides</b> the inside of the cylinder into two chambers, the bottom chamber (cap end) and the piston rod side chamber (rod end / head end).|$|R
50|$|A {{theoretical}} basis for computation {{of the end}} correction is the radiation acoustic impedance of a circular piston. This impedance represents the ratio of acoustic pressure at the <b>piston,</b> <b>divided</b> by the flow rate induced by it. The air speed is typically assumed to be uniform across the tube end. This is a good approximation, but not exactly true in reality, since air viscosity reduces the flow rate in the boundary layer {{very close to the}} tube surface. Thus, air column inside the tube is loaded by the external fluid due to sound energy radiation. This requires an additional length {{to be added to the}} regular length for calculating the natural frequency of the pipe system.|$|R
5000|$|The {{steering}} rack is almost conventional. As {{with a normal}} power-assisted steering setup, there is a rack-and-pinion, and a stepped hydraulic ram with a <b>dividing</b> plate (the <b>piston)</b> in the middle. On {{one side of the}} plate, the piston area is half the area of the other, giving twice the area for the fluid to work on. Thus, with full system pressure on the small area side of the ram, and half system pressure on the large area side, the ram remains perfectly balanced and centred. This is because the lower pressure is working on a larger surface area. The smaller side of the piston is at constant hydraulic pressure, the other side only varies in pressure. NOTE: The author seems to be describing the DS power steering piston and rod, on which the piston {{is in the middle of}} the rod. The SM's steering cylinder has the piston on the end of the rod, which rod's cross-sectional area is half the area of the other side of the piston. Full hydraulic pressure is admitted to the rod side at all times while the pressure on the other side of the piston (its [...] "head") is regulated.|$|R
40|$|The {{acoustical}} {{behavior of}} an elliptical chamber muffler having an end-inlet and side-outlet port is analyzed semi-analytically. A uniform piston source {{is assumed to}} model the 3 -D acoustic field in the elliptical chamber cavity. Towards this end, we consider the modal expansion of acoustic pressure field in the elliptical cavity in terms of angular and radial Mathieu functions, subjected to rigid wall condition, whereupon under the assumption of a point source, Green's function is obtained. On integrating this function over piston area of the side or end port and <b>dividing</b> it by <b>piston</b> area, one obtains the acoustic field, whence one can find the impedance matrix parameters characterizing the 2 -port system. The acoustic performance of these configurations is evaluated in terms of transmission loss (TL). The analytical results thus obtained are compared with 3 -D HA carried on a commercial software for certain muffler configurations. These show excellent agreement, thereby validating the 3 -D semi-analytical piston driven model. The influence of the chamber length {{as well as the}} angular and axial location of the end and side ports on TL performance is also discussed, thus providing useful guidelines to the muffler designer.

40|$|We {{compute the}} finite {{temperature}} Casimir energy for massive scalar field with general curvature coupling subject to Dirichlet or Neumann boundary {{conditions on the}} walls of a closed cylinder with arbitrary cross section, located in a background spacetime of the form M^d_ 1 + 1 ×N^n, where M^d_ 1 + 1 is the (d_ 1 + 1) -dimensional Minkowski spacetime and N^n is an n-dimensional internal manifold. The Casimir energy is regularized using the criteria that it should vanish in the infinite mass limit. The Casimir force acting on a piston moving freely inside the closed cylinder is derived and it is shown that it is independent of the regularization procedure. By letting one of the chambers of the cylinder <b>divided</b> by the <b>piston</b> to be infinitely long, we obtain the Casimir force acting on two parallel plates embedded in the cylinder. It is shown that if both the plates assume Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions, the strength of the Casimir force is reduced by the increase in mass. Under certain conditions, the passage from massless to massive will change the nature of the force from long range to short range. Other properties of the Casimir force such as its sign, its behavior at low and high temperature, and its behavior at small and large plate separations, are found to be similar to the massless case. Explicit exact formulas and asymptotic behaviors of the Casimir force at different limits are derived. The Casimir force when one plate assumes Dirichlet boundary condition and one plate assumes Neumann boundary condition is also derived and shown to be repulsive. Comment: 28 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
