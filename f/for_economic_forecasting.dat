50|$|Many {{methods can}} be used to analyse the data. These include, e.g., time-series {{analysis}} using multiple regression, Box-Jenkins analysis, seasonality analysis. Analysis may be univariate (modeling one series) or multivariate (from several series). econometricians, economic statisticians, and financial analysts formulate models, whether for past relationships or <b>for</b> <b>economic</b> <b>forecasting.</b> These models include both partial equilibrium microeconomics aimed at examining particular parts of an economy or economies, or they may cover a whole economic system, as in general equilibrium theory or and in macroeconomics. Economists use these models to understand past events and to forecast future events, e.g., demand, prices and employment. Methods have also been developed for analyzing or correcting results from use of incomplete data and errors in variables.|$|E

40|$|The {{fortune and}} the risk of a {{business}} venture depends on the future course of the economy. There is a strong demand <b>for</b> <b>economic</b> <b>forecasts</b> and scenarios that can be applied to planning and modeling. While there is an ongoing debate on modeling economic scenarios, the bootstrapping (or resampling) approach presented here has several advantages. As a non-parametric method, it directly relies on past market behaviors rather than debatable assumptions on models and parameters. Simultaneous dependencies between economic variables are automatically captured. Some aspects of the bootstrapping method require additional modeling: choice and ransformation of the economic variables, arbitrage-free consistency, heavy tails of distributions, serial dependence, trends and mean reversion. Results of a complete economic scenario generator are presented, tested and discussed. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{issue is}} {{particularly}} {{popular in the}} literature on business cycles. [...] Research on the subject began with Nelson and Plosser whose paper on GNP and other output aggregates failed to reject the unit root hypothesis for these series. [...] Since then, a debate—entwined with technical disputes on statistical methods—has ensued. Some economists argue that GDP has a unit root or structural break, implying that economic downturns result in permanently lower GDP levels in the long run. Other economists argue that GDP is trend-stationary: That is, when GDP dips below trend during a downturn it later returns to the level implied by the trend so that there is no permanent decrease in output. While the literature on the unit root hypothesis may consist of arcane debate on statistical methods, the hypothesis carries significant practical implications <b>for</b> <b>economic</b> <b>forecasts</b> and policies.|$|R
