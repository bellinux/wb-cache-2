5|$|HD 2039 is {{a stable}} G-type star, meaning it shines with white light {{that can be}} seen in the Sun. In terms of mass, the star {{exhibits}} almost identical properties. HD 2039 exhibits a radius approximately 40 percent larger than the Sun's.

The 120, 3 - to 6 -year-old children completed four hot tasks, which involved an affective component and three cool tasks, which did not. All tasks included binary- and ternary-relational items. Complexity was {{a major source of}} difficulty on all tasks, especially for younger children.

5|$|Kepler-4b, {{initially}} {{known as}} KOI 7.01, is an extrasolar planet first detected as a transit by the Kepler spacecraft. Its radius and mass {{are similar to}} that of Neptune; however, due to its proximity to its host star, it is substantially <b>hotter</b> <b>than</b> any planet in the Solar System. The planet's discovery was announced on January 4, 2010 in Washington, D.C. along with four other planets that were initially detected by the Kepler spacecraft and subsequently confirmed by telescopes at the W.M. Keck Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-5b is a Hot Jupiter with a {{mass that}} is 2.114 times that of Jupiter and a radius of 1.431 times Jupiter's radius. This also means that Kepler-5b is not very dense.

The planet has an equilibrium temperature of 1868 K, making it fifteen times <b>hotter</b> <b>than</b> Jupiter.|$|E

Aristotle however predicted that his system would cause lung oscillation (breathing), which is possible given extra assumptions such as of delays or non-linear responses.|$|E

5|$|The {{temperature}} of {{a lightning bolt}} can be five times <b>hotter</b> <b>than</b> {{the surface of the}} sun. Although the lightning is extremely hot, the duration is short and 90% of strike victims survive. Contrary to the popular idea that lightning does not strike twice in the same spot, some people have been struck by lightning over three times, and skyscrapers like the Empire State Building have been struck numerous times in the same storm.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{conservation}} of angular momentum, the nebula spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within the nebula condensed, the atoms within it began to collide with increasing frequency, converting their kinetic energy into heat. The centre, {{where most of the}} mass collected, became increasingly <b>hotter</b> <b>than</b> the surrounding disc. Over about 100,000 years, the competing forces of gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation caused the contracting nebula to flatten into a spinning protoplanetary disc with a diameter of about 200AU and form a hot, dense protostar (a star in which hydrogen fusion has not yet begun) at the centre.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b is {{a planet}} that has 0.764 Jupiter masses and 1.827 Jupiter radii. In other words, {{it is about}} three-fourths as massive as Jupiter, but is {{slightly}} less than twice Jupiter's size. HAT-P-33b orbits its star at an average distance of 0.0503 AU, which is about 5% of the average distance between the Sun and Earth. This orbit is completed every 3.474474 days (83.39 hours). HAT-P-33b has an equilibrium temperature of 1838 K, which is almost fifteen times <b>hotter</b> <b>than</b> the measured equilibrium temperature of Jupiter (124 K).|$|E

5|$|Kepler-10c is the {{outermost}} {{of the two}} known planets of Kepler-10, completing one orbit of the star every 45.29485 days {{at a distance of}} 0.2407 AU. The inner planet, Kepler-10b, is a rocky planet that orbits every ~0.8 days at a distance of 0.01684 AU. Kepler-10c's equilibrium temperature is estimated at 584 K, almost four times <b>hotter</b> <b>than</b> Jupiter's. The planet's orbital inclination is 89.65º, or almost edge-on with respect to Earth and to Kepler-10. Transits have been observed at points where Kepler-10c has crossed in front of its host star.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-4b's {{discovery}} was announced on January 4, 2010. It {{is the size}} of planet Neptune, at 0.077 MJ (7% the mass of Jupiter) and 0.357 RJ (36% the radius of Jupiter). The planet orbits its star every 3.214 days at 0.045 AU from the star. This distance compares to planet Mercury, which is 0.39 AU from the Sun. Kepler-4's eccentricity was assumed to be 0, however a subsequent independent reanalysis of the discovery data found a value of 0.25 ± 0.12. Likewise, the temperature of the planet is assumed to be 1650 K, far <b>hotter</b> <b>than</b> Jupiter's, which is assumed to be 124 K (not considering its internal heat and atmosphere).|$|E

5|$|Four star {{systems are}} known to harbour planets. HD 330075 is a sunlike star around 164light-years distant that is orbited by a hot Jupiter every 3.4days.

Slightly larger and <b>hotter</b> <b>than</b> the Sun, it was found to have a roughly Jupiter-size planet with an orbital period of 2.8 years. HD 143361 is a binary star system composed of a sunlike star and a faint red dwarf separated by 30.9AU. A planet roughly triple the mass of Jupiter orbits the brighter star every 1057± 20days. HD 142415 is approximately 113light-years distant and has a Jupiter-sized planet with an orbital period of around 386 days.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-11d is an {{exoplanet}} {{discovered in}} the orbit of the sun-like star Kepler-11. It is named for the telescope that discovered it, a NASA spacecraft named Kepler {{that is designed to}} detect Earth-like planets by measuring small dips in the brightness of their host stars as the planets cross in front. This process, known as the transit method, was used to note the presence of six planets in orbit around Kepler-11, of which Kepler-11d is the third from its star. Kepler-11d orbits Kepler-11 well within the orbit of Mercury approximately every 23 days. The planet is approximately six times more massive than the Earth, and has a radius that is three and a half times larger than that of Earth's. It is, however, far <b>hotter</b> <b>than</b> Earth is. Its low density, comparable to that of Saturn, suggests that Kepler-11d has a large hydrogen–helium atmosphere. Kepler-11d was announced with its five sister planets on February 2, 2011 after extensive follow-up studies.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-40b, {{formerly}} known as KOI-428b, is a hot Jupiter discovered in orbit around the star Kepler-40, which {{is about to become}} a red giant. The planet was first noted as a transit event by NASA's Kepler spacecraft. The Kepler team made data collected by its satellite publicly available, including data on Kepler-40; French and Swiss astronomers used the equivalent to one night of measurements on the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph to collect all the data needed to show that a planet was producing the periodic dimming of Kepler-40. The planet, Kepler-40b, is twice the mass of Jupiter and slightly larger than it in size, making it as dense as Neptune.
