40|$|Degradation of {{bacterial}} deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) after infection with T 4 bacteriophage was studied in an endonuclease I-deficient host. The kinetics of degradation {{were similar to}} those seen in other hosts with a normal level of this enzyme. Irradiation of extracellular phage with ultraviolet (UV) destroyed the capacity of the infecting virus to induce extensive breakdown of host DNA, which was, however, converted to high-molecular-weight material. Addition of chloramphenicol to T 4 -infected cells provided data which can be interpreted to indicate the involvement of at least two <b>endodeoxyribonucleases</b> and one exodeoxyribonuclease having a high degree of specificity. A model is proposed showing the sequential action of two <b>endodeoxyribonucleases</b> followed by an exodeoxyribonuclease in the degradation of host DNA.

40|$|Four {{hitherto}} undescribed <b>endodeoxyribonucleases,</b> temporarily designated A 1, A 2, A 3, and B, {{have been}} isolated from E. coli K- 12. Each requires Mg++ {{and is not}} stimulated by ATP or S-adenosylmethionine. A 3 is strongly inhibited by Fe+++ and weakly inhibited by ATP, S-adenosylmethionine, and DPN, whereas B is inhibited by caffeine. Each can be purified free of exonuclease or DNA- 3 ′-phosphatase. A 1 (molecular weight approximately 72, 000) cleaves single-stranded, circular fd DNA to form 3 ′-hydroxyl termini and introduces nicks and breaks in the closed, double-stranded replicative form DNA of fd (fd RFI). A 2 (molecular weight approximately 46, 000) cleaves fd DNA and introduces nicks and breaks in RFI, forming 3 ′-hydroxyl- and 5 ′-phosphoryl termini. A 3 (molecular weight approximately 38, 000) cleaves fd DNA to form 3 ′-hydroxyl termini and introduces only nicks in fd RFI.

40|$|Permeabilized {{mammalian}} {{cells and}} isolated nuclei {{were used to}} study various aspects of DNA replication and repair. The present paper describes a progressive fragmentation of parental DNA in human lymphoblastoid cells that were permeabilized with L-alpha-lysophosphatidylcholine or with saponin and incubated at 37 degrees C in a DNA-synthesis mixture. The formation of DNA single-strand breaks (measured by alkaline elution) was linear with the time of incubation and was temperature-dependent. It was prevented by deleting Mg 2 + or both Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + from the incubation mixture, or {{by the addition of}} EDTA. It was increased by deleting the components necessary for DNA synthesis, and by substituting Mn 2 + for Mg 2 + and Ca 2 +. DNA strand breaks also accumulated in isolated nuclei incubated in a DNA synthesis mixture, but not when Mg 2 + was omitted. These results suggest that DNA fragmentation in permeabilized cells and nuclei was due to an activation of (Ca 2 + + Mg 2 +) -dependent <b>endodeoxyribonucleases.</b> The integrity of template DNA needs to be ascertained when the conditions for measuring DNA synthesis in permeabilized cells or in nuclei are formulated...|$|R
40|$|The enzymatic {{synthesis}} of 7 -deazapurine nucleoside containing DNA (501 bp) is performed by PCR-amplification (Taq polymerase) using a pUC 18 plasmid DNA as template and the triphosphates of 7 -deaza- 2 '-deoxyguanosiine (c 7 Gd),-adenosine (c 7 Ad) and-inosine (c 7 ld). c 7 GdTP can fully replace dGTP {{resulting in a}} completely modified DNA-fragment of defined size and sequence. The other two 7 -deazapurine triphosphates (c 7 AdTP) and (c 7 IdTP) require {{the presence of the}} parent purine 2 '-deoxyribonucIeotides. In puriine/ 7 -deazapurine nucleofiide mixtures Taq polymerase prefers purine over 7 -deazapurine nucleotides but accepts c 7 GdTP much better than c 7 AdTP or c 7 IdTP. As incorporation of 7 -deazapurine nucleotides represents a modification of the major groove of DNA {{it can be used to}} probe DNA/protein interaction. Regioselective phospho-diester hydrolysis of the modified DNA-fragments was studied with 28 <b>endodeoxyribonucleases.</b> c 7 Gd is able to protect the DNA from the phosphodiester hydrolysis in more than 20 cases, only a few enzymes (Mae III, Rsa I, Hind DID, Pvu II or Taq I) do still hydrolyze the modified DNA. c 7 Ad protects DNA less efficiently, as this DNA could only be modified in part. The absence of N- 7 as potential binding position or a geometric distortion of the recognition duplex caused by the 7 -deazapurine base can account for protection of hydrolysis...|$|R

40|$|DNA from T 7 phage {{containing}} AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) sites was repaired by {{the successive}} actions of three chromatin enzymes [AP <b>endodeoxyribonuclease,</b> DNAase IV (5 ' [...] 3 '-exodeoxyribonuclease) and DNA polymerase-beta] prepared from rat liver and T 4 -phage DNA ligase. Since DNA ligase {{is also found}} in rat liver chromatin, all the activities used for the successful repair in vitro are thus present in the chromatin of a eukaryotic cell. Our results show, in particular, that the chromatin DNAase IV is capable of excising the AP site from the DNA strand nicked by the chromatin AP <b>endodeoxyribonuclease.</b> We did not try to combine all the enzymes, since competition between some of them might have prevented the repair; we have, for instance, shown that DNA ligase can seal the incision 5 ' to the AP site made by the AP <b>endodeoxyribonuclease.</b> Changes in chromatin structure during repair might perhaps prevent this competition when nuclear DNA is repaired in the living cell...|$|E
40|$|Hemophilus parainfluenzae <b>endodeoxyribonuclease</b> {{was used}} to degrade the DNA of H. influenzae and to follow the {{biological}} activity of 14 markers associated with this DNA. It was found that some H. influenzae markers were completely inactivated by <b>endodeoxyribonuclease</b> treatment, while others appeared to retain all or almost all of their original activity. The bulk of the H. influenzae DNA was reduced to double-stranded pieces {{of the order of}} 8 × 105 to 1 × 106 daltons. Velocity sedimentation of the DNA in sucrose gradients disclosed that markers that retained biological activity were present in DNA particles that were of the order of 1 × 106 daltons or larger, and indicated a close correlation between the size of the DNA fragment and the amount of biological activity retained. These data suggest that H. parainfluenzae <b>endodeoxyribonuclease</b> breaks DNA at specific sites. The nalr marker was shown to have twice as much biological activity after treatment with <b>endodeoxyribonuclease</b> when assayed at saturating DNA concentrations. In the linear portion of the DNA dose-response curve, the biological activity of this marker was reduced 3 - to 10 -fold compared to untreated DNA (in accord with the reduced size of its DNA). These data demonstrate a specific enrichment of the nalr marker by about 6 - to 20 -fold, and suggest a technique for the separation and purification of specific segments of DNA...|$|E
40|$|Octadeoxynucleotides {{with the}} {{sequence}} d[(p) GG*AATTCC] {{have been prepared}} by solid-phase synthesis employing regular and base-modified phosphoramidites. These oligomers which contain an isosterically altered recognition sequence of the <b>endodeoxyribonuclease</b> Eco RI form duplexes under appropriate salt conditions. Since G* can represent 7 -deaza- 2 '-deoxyguanosine the oligomers were used as probes to study their cleavage by the <b>endodeoxyribonuclease</b> Eco RI. The enzymatic hydrolysis of the modified octamer was strongly decreased compared to the regular DNA-fragment. This shows that guanine N- 7 located at the cleavage site {{is important for the}} recognition process by the enzyme. The residual enzymatic activity is discussed on the basis of reduced specificity towards the recognition fragment. The fact that this cleavage occurs already under regular conditions indicates that the process described here bases on an intrinsic property of the oligomer and is different from the star activity...|$|E
40|$|At {{least three}} {{nuclease}} activities {{are associated with}} purified frog virus 3. These activities are <b>endodeoxyribonuclease</b> (pH 7. 5, double-stranded [DS] and single-stranded [SS] deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]); <b>endodeoxyribonuclease</b> (pH 5. 0, DS and SS DNA); endoribonuclease (DS and SS ribonucleic acid [RNA], pH 7. 5). These activities are not adsorbed {{to the surface of}} the virion but are within the viral capsid and require detergent disruption of virions to unmask enzyme activity. Only one activity, deoxyribonuclease (pH 5. 0, SS and DS DNA) appears to be core-associated after detergent disruption of virions. The ribonuclease degrades poliovirus replicative-form RNA, reovirus native RNA, and poly(I) poly(C) to a product with a sedimentation coefficient of about 6 S.

40|$|The major {{conclusion}} {{from these}} studies is that variants of Haemophilus influenzae Rd which restrict and modify phage S 2 are metastable {{and capable of}} giving rise to one another with high frequency. Nonrestrictive RdS cells segregate spontaneously to the restricting, modifying phenotype in about 5 % of the progeny of a single clone. The restrictive cells derived from RdS revert to the nonrestrictive phenotype in 15 to 25 % of the progeny of a single clone. These frequencies are not appreciably affected by treatment with acriflavine or ethidium bromide, compounds which affect plasmid stability, or by nitrosoguanidine, a powerful mutagen. The genetic locus for restriction and modification of bacteriophage S 2 is {{found to have a}} chromosomal position between the biotin and proline loci. Restriction-modification of phage S 2 {{has been shown to be}} a function of its deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in that transfection with S 2 phage DNA or prophage DNA is subject to host restriction and modification. An enzyme preparation, which contains <b>endodeoxyribonuclease</b> but no appreciable exonuclease activity, from mutant H. influenzae com− 10 did not restrict phage S 2 ·RdS DNA or prophage DNA transfecting activity, indicating that this <b>endodeoxyribonuclease</b> is not responsible for phage restriction. A new restriction enzyme isolated from H. influenzae Rd was found to be the major enzyme involved in the restriction of bacteriophage S 2. The enzyme inactivated the transfecting activity of unmodified phage DNA but did not attack modified phage DNA.

A single species of DNA-binding protein with a mol. wt. of 36 000 had very high affinity for single-stranded DNA, but a low one for double-stranded DNA. Proteins with such characteristic affinity for single-stranded DNA destabilize the DNA helix and are essential for viral DNA replication. Thus, the 36 000 mol. wt.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the kinetics {{of the interaction between}} <b>endodeoxyribonuclease</b> EcoRI (EC 3. 1. 23. 13) and nine linear DNA fragments that range in size between 34 and 6, 200 base pairs and contain the EcoRI site of plasmid pBR 322 in a central location. The kinetic parameters governing both formation and decay of specific endonuclease. DNA complexes increase 8 -fold with increasing chain length over this size range. In contrast, equilibrium competition experiments demonstrated that the intrinsic affinity of endonuclease for its recognition sequence is independent of DNA chain length over this range. Thus, DNA sequences outside the recognition site enhance the rate at which EcoRI endonuclease locates or leaves its recognition site without affecting the intrinsic thermodynamic parameters of site-specific interaction. These results are consistent with a facilitated diffusion mechanism for specific DNA site location by this enzyme...|$|E
40|$|A non-enzymic protein {{factor that}} {{increases}} the in vitro rate of synthesis by HeLa DNA polymerase alpha 15 - to 30 -fold with denatured DNA as template has been partially purified from the cytoplasmic fraction of HeLa cells. The stimulatory effect is highly specific for HeLa DNA polymerase alpha and for DNA templates that contain extensive regions of single-strandedness. Synthesis with denatured DNA as template presumably proceeds from 3 '-hydroxyl termini formed at loop-back regions since the synthesized DNA product and template are covalently linked. The stimulatory protein factor chromatographs as a basic protein, has an approximate molecular weight of 30, 000 daltons and binds with moderate affinity to denatured DNA cellulose, being eluted by o. 4 M NaCl.

40|$|We {{examined}} virally transformed murine fibroblast clones as {{targets for}} cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) -triggered lysis and genome digestion. Strikingly, while all clones were essentially equivalent {{in the ability}} to be lysed, one clone, SV 3 T 3 -B 2. 1, failed to exhibit genome digestion associated with CTL attack. Other aspects of the physiological cell death process, including loss of adhesion and nuclear envelope breakdown (lamin phosphorylation and solubilization), were not altered in this clone. The absence of genome digestion associated with CTL-induced cell death correlated with the absence of <b>endodeoxyribonuclease</b> activity in the nuclei of that clone. Characterization of the activity affected identifies a calcium-dependent, DNase I-like endonuclease of approximately 40 kDa, normally present constitutively in all cell nuclei, as the enzyme responsible for genome digestion associated with CTL-mediated cell death.

The nuclease hydrolysed endonucleolytically double-stranded circular and linear DNA. The enzyme makes nicks in one strand of the DNA in G-rich regions, leaving either 5 ' or 3 ' short, single-stranded overhangs with 3 '-hydroxy and 5 '-phosphate termini. Breaks in the DNA occur when two nicks in opposite strands are close together.

The enzyme makes single-strand breaks in linear or covalently closed circular phage double-stranded DNA molecules. The enzyme was partially purified by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE- and carboxymethyl-Sepharose columns followed by electrophoresis in DNA-containing polyacrylamide gels. The enzyme was separated from reverse transcriptase (p 80 pol), and the final endonuclease preparation contained no detectable reverse transcriptase activity. The DEAE-Sepharose column-purified endonuclease activity contained a polypeptide of about 40, 000 Mr that we term p 40. Peptide mapping experiments demonstrated that p 40 shares methionine-labeled tryptic peptides with Pr 200 gag-pol and Pr 135 pol. Six major methionine-labeled tryptic peptides derived from p 40 were found in Pr 200 gag-pol, but only five of these were detected in Pr 135 pol. The four core proteins (p 30, p 15, pp 12, and p 10) and p 80 pol plus p 40 account for most, but not all, of the peptide sequences of Pr 200 gag-pol. The endonuclease-associated p 40 is similar in size and precursor origin to the avian retrovirus-coded endonuclease (p 32). In view of these similarities to the avian p 32 endonuclease and its association with partially purified Rauscher {{murine leukemia virus}}-associated endonuclease preparations, we propose that p 40 is the Rauscher murine leukemia virus-coded endonuclease...|$|E
