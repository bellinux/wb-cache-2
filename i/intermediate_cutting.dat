40|$|In Italy some {{agricultural}} {{areas have been}} planted with high value hardwood mixed plantations (mainly walnut or cherry trees) realized with a technique that provides benefits also {{for the presence of}} accessory species. The purpose of this work is to study <b>intermediate</b> <b>cutting</b> operations in mixed plantations. Two different plantations of walnut (with poplar and other fitting trees), situated in Lombardia region (Northern Italy), were investigated. In Casal Buttano plantation walnut has a planting distance of 10 x 14 m and it is combined with poplar (5 x 14 m distance). Between the two species there are two shrub rows (cob hazel and elder) and a common European alder row. In walnut rows, the main species is alternated with Eleagnus umbellata shrubs. In San Matteo delle Chiaviche plantation the planting distance between trees is 3 x 3. 5 m. Trees species are walnut, poplar, common European alder and a shrub (Eleagnus umbellata). During <b>intermediate</b> <b>cutting</b> operation poplar needs to be felled providing no damages to standing walnuts. Because of the different distance between species in the two stands, different logging methods were needed. Time studies were carried out to analyse two different logging methods. In Casal Buttano plantation cob hazel shrubs were cut with a cutting-chipper machine that provided biomass for heating. During poplar logging an operator with chainsaw felled the trees assisted by an excavator equipped with a loading grapple; the trees were then forwarded on a tractor bunk. In San Matteo delle Chiaviche plantation a chainsaw operator felled poplar in the right direction supported by an operator with felling lever; the trees were skidded by tractors. Productivity and costs of the two methods were calculated. Both adopted logging methods did not cause any damage to the standing walnuts. First method might be suitable when rows of poplar and walnuts are separated by an accessory species row, in order to avoid damages caused by the excavator. Second method is advisable in stands where rows of poplar and walnuts are adjacent, without any accessory species in the middle...|$|E

Consequently, the mass transfer is realized by the CO/CO 2 mass transport mechanism, and the oxide particles are the precursors of the hard phase particles. The whole reaction can be divided into three reaction steps with TinO 2 n- 1 and oxycarbides as solid state intermediates. The use of sol-gel precursors leads to an acceleration of the first reaction step, but is not advantageous for the preparation of the pure carbide. The influence of the presence of nitrogen in the gas phase on the composition and grain size of the hard phase particles prepared from a TiO 2 + 2. 7 C mixture is discussed.

40|$|M. Ing. Grade 4 {{titanium}} is {{a commercially}} pure grade titanium alloy extensively used in various industries including {{the chemical industry}} and more recently in the biomedical industry. Grade 4 has found a niche as a biomedical material for production of components such as orthopaedic and dental implants. Its physical properties such as high corrosion resistance, low thermal conductivity and high strength make it suitable for these applications. These properties also make it hard-to-machine similar to the other grades of titanium alloys and other metals such as nickel based alloys. During machining of titanium, elevated temperatures are generated at the tool-workpiece interface due to its low thermal conductivity. Its high strength is also maintained at these high temperatures. These tend to impair the cutting tool affecting its machinability. Various investigations on other grades of titanium and other hard-to-machine materials have shown that machining at high cutting speeds may improve certain aspects of their machinability. High speed machining (HSM) is used to improve productivity in the machining process and to therefore lower manufacturing costs. HSM may, however, change the surface integrity of the machined material. Surface integrity refers to {{the properties of the}} surface and sub-surface of a machined component which may be quite different from the substrate. The properties of the surface and sub-surface of a component may have a marked effect on the functional behaviour of a machined component. Fatigue life and wear are examples of properties that may be significantly influenced by a change in the surface integrity. Surface integrity may include the topography, the metallurgy and various other mechanical properties. It is evaluated by examination of surface integrity indicators. In this investigation the three main surface integrity indicators are examined. These are surface roughness, sub-surface hardness and residual stress. White layer thickness and chip morphology were also observed as results of the machining process used. The effect of HSM on the surface integrity of grade 4 is largely unknown. This investigation therefore aims to address this limitation by conducting an experimental investigation on the effect of HSM on selected surface integrity indicators for grade 4. Two forged bars of grade 4 alloy were machined using a CNC lathe at two depths of cut, 0. 2 mm and 1 mm. Each bar was machined at varying cutting speeds ranging from 70 m/min to 290 m/min at intervals of approximately 20 m/min. Machined samples were prepared from these cutting speeds and depths of cut. The three surface integrity indicators were then evaluated with respect to the cutting speed and depth of cut (DoC). iv Results show that a combination of <b>intermediate</b> <b>cutting</b> speeds and low DoC may have desirable effects on the surface integrity of grade 4. Highest compressive stresses were obtained when machining with these conditions. High compressive stresses are favourable in cases where the fatigue life of a material {{is an important factor in}} the functionality of a component. Subsurface hardening was noticed at 0. 2 mm DoC, with no subsurface softening at all cutting speeds. Surface hardness higher than the bulk hardness tends to improve the wear resistance of the machined material. Though surface roughness values for all depths of cut were below the standard fine finish of 1. 6 μm, roughness values of samples machined at 0. 2 mm DoC continued to decrease with increase in cutting speed. Low surface roughness values may also influence the improvement of fatigue life of the machined components. These machining conditions, (<b>intermediate</b> <b>cutting</b> speeds and low DoC), seem to have promoted mechanically dominated deformation during machining rather than thermal dominated deformation. Thermal dominated deformation was prominent on titanium machined at DoC of 1 mm...|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering) The {{surface finish}} of {{machined}} components is generally described by conventional surface trace measurements with trace lengths {{in the order of}} a few millimetres. Surface roughness descriptors (such as the arithmetic mean roughness Ra) are then used to quantify the surface finish. In general these techniques cannot however fully capture the finer topography features on a sub-micron and nano-scale level. An investigation was therefore performed in order to quantitatively characterise the sub-micron or nano-scale surface features of turned Grade 4 titanium alloy. Submicron surface features are believed to {{play a significant role in}} the performance of machined components in various applications in the aerospace and biomedical fields. The effects of the machining parameters on the sub-micron surface features were investigated. Grade 4 titanium alloy bars were machined with different cutting parameters. The cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut were adjusted in an attempt to characterise and control their effects on the sub-micron surface features. Sophisticated atomic force microscopy is then required to quantify this roughness component by using a variable length scale roughness descriptor. It was concluded that there exists a significant sub-micron surface roughness component that is not fully captured by the conventional roughness measurement techniques. At low length scales the surface roughness was higher than theoretically expected due to the existence of significant sub-micron surface irregularities. The measured conventional roughness was observed to be lower than theoretically expected in all cases. This is due to the reduction of the expected major surface feature height as a result of the tool geometry and related shearing process. It was found that the variable length scale surface topography was affected by cutting speed and feed rate. In general at low scale lengths the roughness increases with an increase in cutting speed. However at the conventional roughness length scale a local maximum was displayed at an <b>intermediate</b> <b>cutting</b> speed (± 150 m/min). The feed rate was found to affect the intermediate length scale surface topography by altering the sub-micron to conventional topography transition region. Depth of cut had no appreciable effect over the length scale range measured...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} an attempt {{has been made}} to make a {{contribution}} to the epidemiology of gastro-intestinal parasitism in calves under Dutch conditions. Methods of prevention by grassland management have recently been developed in England and in the Netherlands. The work in our country had an empirical approach and the need for some epidemiological basis was felt. For this purpose investigations were carried out by means of a few grazing experiments with calves, as well as by survey work on practical farms. Observations included larval infestations of pasture, egg-output in faeces and growth of animals. Concerning the methods used for larval counts in pasture samples and eggcounts in faeces, emphasis was put on the reproducibility of counts under routine conditions. It was concluded that: 1. Due to very large between-sample variation, intensification of sampling is of much more importance than refining laboratory techniques. It may be stated that those techniques are the best that are least time-consuming. 2. Also from the view point of labour-input, collection of 'herd samples' taken from fresh faecal pats on the pasture, should be preferred to rectal sampling of individual animals, in case that investigation {{of a large number of}} herds is necessary. With respect to the larval infestation of grassland the following conclusions could be drawn: 1. The seasonal pattern which can be observed on calf paddocks was very similar to that found by MICHEL in England in studies extending over several years. 2. This course was only found on fields where during the entire season egg excreting animals were more or less continuously grazed, without <b>intermediate</b> <b>cutting.</b> 3. Of the genera Nematodirus, Cooperia and Ostertagia the first mentioned succeeded best of all in overwintering, whereas the last mentioned genus was least succesful. 4. In the field, significant differences in larval infection exist between fields that are destined to be grazed by calves when turned out in spring. This variation is reflected by the level of egg-counts of calves later in the season. From egg-counts in faecal samples it was concluded that: 1. They have no value as an aid for diagnosis. 2. This is due primarily to the phenomenon of suppression of egg-output. During the first weeks after patency egg-counts reflect larval intake fairly accurately, but later this relation is disturbed so that egg-output is either main tained at a constant level, or even falls below the level of egg-counts seen in calves that have experienced a smaller infection. 3. The phenomenon of egg-count suppression is seen in different degrees among the various genera and there are also indications that it occurs for genera in a certain order: first and strongest in Nematodirus spp., later and less clearly in Ostertagia spp. while Cooperia spp. occupies a position between these two. 4. Egg-counts may be of value for monitoring large scale experiments by which new methods of prevention are tested, and where small infections of pasture and animals are present. From the observations on growth performance of animals the following conclusions were drawn: 1. Gastro-intestinal parasites can, under experimental conditions, be demon strated to cause growth-inhibition. 2. The growth performance of calves in the field during their first grazing season shows considerable variations. 3. No relation can be demonstrated between egg-output of calf-herds and growth, not even if other growth affecting factors are taken into account. The above mentioned conclusions are discussed in chapter 4, particularly with reference to work recently published in the Netherlands and in England. Good methods of prevention, by grazing management have been developed. For finding the most economic system for various situations in the field, further investigations will be necessary...|$|E
40|$|Starting {{from the}} fact that stand {{structure}} is significantly disturbed and from the assumption that all stands of pedunculate oak at forest level older than 100 years are potentially considered for stand regeneration, it is obvious that forest planning and management have to define their priorities on the basis of which individual, potentially mature and mature stands, will be regenerated. The general objective {{of this paper is to}} research the structure and mutual impacts of stand, site and economic factors on the elements of stand structure in a greater area of pedunculate oak forests consisting of old or potentially mature pedunculate oak stands with a disturbed structure. Based on obtained structural relations, the goal was to determine by modeling the easily obtainable elements of the variable (model), which will represent the objective criterion for stand ranking according to the regeneration priority and structural and economic requirements. The subject of the research are pedunculate oak forests in the Central Posavina region, where 37 stands, with stocking of less than 0. 8, were randomly selected and divided into 3 age groups (101 – 120 years, 121 – 135 years, > 135 years) in 16 management units. On a total of 146 established plots of 25 m radius, estimates and measurements were carried out of variables at the level of individual model trees (6 trees of the main species – upper storey layer – nearest to the plot centre) and of stand and site variables (2 breast-height diameters, crown diameter, tree height, base height of the crown and height of the widest part of the crown, varietal trunk structure, crown defoliation, increment core, breast-height diameter of all trees higher than 1. 3 m, seedlings, potential <b>intermediate</b> <b>cutting,</b> died trees, diameters of stump of cut trees, shrub layer, microrelief, canopy, health status, litter, understorey vegetation). The estimated and measured data were processed and appropriate variables for data analysis derived. The complex potential revenue (rent) difference was defined for stand regeneration (Equation 3) as a dependent variable and objective criterion for stand ranking according to regeneration priority. By means of partial linear analyses, multivariate analysis and modeling (generalized linear modeling), mutual and complex impacts of stand, site and economic factors on elements of stand structure and potential revenue (rent) difference were investigated. Statistical analyses were performed by application of the SAS software package, whereas descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, integration of functions and development of graphical presentations were carried out by means of the STATISTICA 8. 2 software package. The research included different management, stand and structural characteristics (Table 1) and determined a statistically significant mutual impact of individual variables of stand, site and economic factors on certain elements of stand structure and potential revenue (rent) difference (Table 2). Multivariate analysis revealed models of complex impacts of stand, site and economic factors on standing volume of pedunculate oak and revenue (rent) difference (Table 3). According to the obtained data, all three models are statistically significant for the estimated standing volume of pedunculate oak and also for the estimated revenue (rent) difference. The stand factors in total account for 35 % variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 22 % variability of revenue (rent) difference. The site factors account for 39 % variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 34 % variability of revenue (rent) difference, whereas economic factors account for even 45 % variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 43 % variability of revenue (rent) difference. The results of the Tukey post hoc (HSD) test for statistically significant variables of multivariate analysis of the revenue (rent) difference and the standing volume of pedunculate oak (Table 4) indicate that there exists a relation between the standing volume of pedunculate oak as a complex structure element and the potential revenue (rent) difference. The results proved the existence of a direct impact of individual elements of main tree species as well as a complex impact of structure elements on the variable of potential revenue (rent) difference (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). The standing volume of pedunculate oak as a complex structure element is a suitable dependent variable, along with the revenue (rent) difference, for comparative analysis of impacts of statistically significant stand, site and economic factors on stand regeneration priority. Due to a significantly smaller standing volume of pedunculate oak as a consequence of its disturbed structure, there is a higher regeneration priority for the youngest stand group (100 to 119 years) in comparison with the older stands. Accordingly, in forests with disturbed structure age cannot be an objective criterion for planning stand regeneration. Stands with disturbed canopy of understorey layer with the smallest and lowest value of standing volume expectedly have the highest regeneration priority, i. e. their maintenance would lead to both economic losses and disturbed site conditions. In view of site preservation, the problem is particularly marked in case of pure stands, where pedunculate oak trees do not cover the soil in a sufficient measure, and have a worsening tendency due to weakening and dying of trees. According to the obtained results, which indicate that there is a relation between site and standing volume of pedunculate oak and revenue (rent) difference, stands with better site have lower regeneration priority. This is related to the fact that stand structure on a higher quality site is characterized by a lower number of pedunculate oak trees of larger dimensions and potentially large value increase, which is also characteristic of forest communities of pedunculate oak and common hornbeam. On average, a smaller standing volume of pedunculate oak in a floodplain pedunculate oak forest and a higher regeneration priority indicate disturbed structure conditions. Due to hydro-ameliorative works, this community has suffered even greater site changes and is more in danger of dieback, so regeneration will be more difficult and expectably less successful in case of stands with disturbed site and structure conditions, both at early and delayed regeneration. Regarding the proportional relation between the quantity of prescribed cut and the standing volume of pedunculate oak, stands with better structure and higher prescribed intermediate cut are expected to have a lower regeneration priority. A prescribed cut below 15 m 3 /ha (50 % sampled plots) indicates a significant share of preserved stands left to natural development, with necessary felling of only weak and dying trees by the beginning of regeneration or recovery. The stand structure characteristics according to their belonging to individual management units are more a consequence of spatial differences in site and structure conditions than a management characteristic. Thus we can separate 3 management units in the centre of the Lonjsko polje floodplain (Žutica, Kutina floodplain forests and Brezovica), where dieback of pedunculate oak was the highest and which have a more marked stand regeneration priority in comparison to the management units with a more preserved structure of old stands (Trstika, Josip Kozarac). The impact of individual structure elements of pedunculate oak, unlike the rent, has a high correlation, with the exception of numbers of pedunculate oak trees. This can be explained by the fact that the same number of pedunculate oak trees can represent very different structural relations in terms of average dimensions of pedunculate oak trees, basal area and standing volume of pedunculate oak as well as different rate of other tree species in the structure. A particular significance with regards to the application of the results can be seen in the fact that easily obtainable structural elements, such as pedunculate oak basal area, number of pedunculate oak trees and diameter increment of pedunculate oak, proved to be very good indicators, which can explain nearly 70 % variability of the complex impact on the revenue (rent) difference. The obtained research results prove the existence of a direct relation between stand structure and regeneration priority. There is, therefore, a practical possibility to apply the established complex variable of revenue (rent) difference for ranking of stands or stand parts (stand dividing) according to regeneration priority, which can be determined by means of easily obtainable elements of structure (tree numbers, basal area and diameter increment of pedunculate oak). An extension of the research into site-structure relations to include a greater, or even the entire area of pedunculate oak forests in Croatia as well as spatial and multiobjective forest management criteria (spatial distribution and area of stands for regeneration, habitat requirements) for stand regeneration planning would be a welcome continuation of this work...|$|E

Irreversible carbonyl-amino crosslinks induced by carbonyl stress are essentially toxiferous for aging-related functional losses in modern society. Results show that (-) -epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the main polyphenol in green tea, can neutralize the carbonyl-amino cross-linking reaction and inhibit LF formation, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. We explored the mechanism of the neutralization process from protein, cell, and animal levels using spectrofluorometry, infrared spectroscopy, conformation antibodies, and electron microscopy. LF demonstrated an amyloidogenic β-sheet-rich with antiparallel structure, which accelerated the carbonyl-amino crosslinks formation and disrupted proteolysis in both PC 12 cells and D-galactose (D-gal) -induced brain aging mice models. Additionally, EGCG effectively inhibited the formation of the amyloidogenic β-sheet-rich structure of LF, and prevented its conversion into toxic and on-pathway aggregation <b>intermediates,</b> thereby <b>cutting</b> off the carbonyl-amino crosslinks.

Based on obtained structural relations, the goal was to determine by modeling the easily obtainable elements of the variable (model), which will represent the objective criterion for stand ranking according to the regeneration priority and structural and economic requirements. The subject of the research are pedunculate oak forests in the Central Posavina region, where 37 stands, with stocking of less than 0. 8, were randomly selected and divided into 3 age groups (101 – 120 years, 121 – 135 years, > 135 years) in 16 management units. On a total of 146 established plots of 25 m radius, estimates and measurements were carried out of variables at the level of individual model trees (6 trees of the main species – upper storey layer – nearest to the plot centre) and of stand and site variables (2 breast-height diameters, crown diameter, tree height, base height of the crown and height of the widest part of the crown, varietal trunk structure, crown defoliation, increment core, breast-height diameter of all trees higher than 1. 3 m, seedlings, potential <b>intermediate</b> <b>cutting,</b> died trees, diameters of stump of cut trees, shrub layer, microrelief, canopy, health status, litter, understorey vegetation). The estimated and measured data were processed and appropriate variables for data analysis derived. The complex potential revenue (rent) difference was defined for stand regeneration (Equation 3) as a dependent variable and objective criterion for stand ranking according to regeneration priority. By means of partial linear analyses, multivariate analysis and modeling (generalized linear modeling), mutual and complex impacts of stand, site and economic factors on elements of stand structure and potential revenue (rent) difference were investigated. Statistical analyses were performed by application of the SAS software package, whereas descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, integration of functions and development of graphical presentations were carried out by means of the STATISTICA 8. 2 software package. The research included different management, stand and structural characteristics (Table 1) and determined a statistically significant mutual impact of individual variables of stand, site and economic factors on certain elements of stand structure and potential revenue (rent) difference (Table 2). Multivariate analysis revealed models of complex impacts of stand, site and economic factors on standing volume of pedunculate oak and revenue (rent) difference (Table 3). According to the obtained data, all three models are statistically significant for the estimated standing volume of pedunculate oak and also for the estimated revenue (rent) difference. The stand factors in total account for 35 % variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 22 % variability of revenue (rent) difference. The site factors account for 39 % variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 34 % variability of revenue (rent) difference, whereas economic factors account for even 45 % variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 43 % variability of revenue (rent) difference. The results of the Tukey post hoc (HSD) test for statistically significant variables of multivariate analysis of the revenue (rent) difference and the standing volume of pedunculate oak (Table 4) indicate that there exists a relation between the standing volume of pedunculate oak as a complex structure element and the potential revenue (rent) difference. The results proved the existence of a direct impact of individual elements of main tree species as well as a complex impact of structure elements on the variable of potential revenue (rent) difference (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). The standing volume of pedunculate oak as a complex structure element is a suitable dependent variable, along with the revenue (rent) difference, for comparative analysis of impacts of statistically significant stand, site and economic factors on stand regeneration priority. Due to a significantly smaller standing volume of pedunculate oak as a consequence of its disturbed structure, there is a higher regeneration priority for the youngest stand group (100 to 119 years) in comparison with the older stands. Accordingly, in forests with disturbed structure age cannot be an objective criterion for planning stand regeneration. Stands with disturbed canopy of understorey layer with the smallest and lowest value of standing volume expectedly have the highest regeneration priority, i. e. their maintenance would lead to both economic losses and disturbed site conditions. In view of site preservation, the problem is particularly marked in case of pure stands, where pedunculate oak trees do not cover the soil in a sufficient measure, and have a worsening tendency due to weakening and dying of trees. According to the obtained results, which indicate that there is a relation between site and standing volume of pedunculate oak and revenue (rent) difference, stands with better site have lower regeneration priority. This is related to the fact that stand structure on a higher quality site is characterized by a lower number of pedunculate oak trees of larger dimensions and potentially large value increase, which is also characteristic of forest communities of pedunculate oak and common hornbeam. On average, a smaller standing volume of pedunculate oak in a floodplain pedunculate oak forest and a higher regeneration priority indicate disturbed structure conditions. Due to hydro-ameliorative works, this community has suffered even greater site changes and is more in danger of dieback, so regeneration will be more difficult and expectably less successful in case of stands with disturbed site and structure conditions, both at early and delayed regeneration. Regarding the proportional relation between the quantity of prescribed cut and the standing volume of pedunculate oak, stands with better structure and higher prescribed intermediate cut are expected to have a lower regeneration priority. A prescribed cut below 15 m 3 /ha (50 % sampled plots) indicates a significant share of preserved stands left to natural development, with necessary felling of only weak and dying trees by the beginning of regeneration or recovery. The stand structure characteristics according to their belonging to individual management units are more a consequence of spatial differences in site and structure conditions than a management characteristic. Thus we can separate 3 management units in the centre of the Lonjsko polje floodplain (Žutica, Kutina floodplain forests and Brezovica), where dieback of pedunculate oak was the highest and which have a more marked stand regeneration priority in comparison to the management units with a more preserved structure of old stands (Trstika, Josip Kozarac). The impact of individual structure elements of pedunculate oak, unlike the rent, has a high correlation, with the exception of numbers of pedunculate oak trees. This can be explained by the fact that the same number of pedunculate oak trees can represent very different structural relations in terms of average dimensions of pedunculate oak trees, basal area and standing volume of pedunculate oak as well as different rate of other tree species in the structure. A particular significance with regards to the application of the results can be seen in the fact that easily obtainable structural elements, such as pedunculate oak basal area, number of pedunculate oak trees and diameter increment of pedunculate oak, proved to be very good indicators, which can explain nearly 70 % variability of the complex impact on the revenue (rent) difference. The obtained research results prove the existence of a direct relation between stand structure and regeneration priority. There is, therefore, a practical possibility to apply the established complex variable of revenue (rent) difference for ranking of stands or stand parts (stand dividing) according to regeneration priority, which can be determined by means of easily obtainable elements of structure (tree numbers, basal area and diameter increment of pedunculate oak). An extension of the research into site-structure relations to include a greater, or even the entire area of pedunculate oak forests in Croatia as well as spatial and multiobjective forest management criteria (spatial distribution and area of stands for regeneration, habitat requirements) for stand regeneration planning would be a welcome continuation of this work...|$|E
40|$|To assess {{adverse effects}} of ambient ozone on injury and growth, EDU (ethylenediurea) and non-EDU-treated plants of {{subterranean}} clover (Trifolium subterraneum cv. Geraldton) were exposed to ambient air at four rural sites in the Netherlands. In each of two successive experiments of eight weeks during the 1994 growing season, an <b>intermediate</b> harvest (<b>cutting)</b> was performed after four weeks of exposure. Concentrations of ambient ozone were high in Experiment 1 (June 21 –August 16) and relatively low in Experiment 2 (August 23 –October 18). Subterranean clover displayed characteristic ozone injury at all sites in Experiment 1 and in Experiment 2 until the intermediate harvest (September 20). The proportion of leaves injured in non-EDU-treated plants was higher than that in plants treated with the antioxidant. Both the degree of injury and the protective effect by EDU differed between sites and were {{not related to the}} measured ozone levels. The proposed short-term critical levels for injury development by ozone would not have protected clover against ozone injury in Experiment 2. The site-dependent pattern of injury in non-EDU-treated plants was similar for the various harvests and experiments and a maximal degree of 23 % injury was observed after four weeks of exposure. The protective effect by EDU was related positively to the injury intensity in non-EDU-treated plants, irrespective of site, harvest and experiment. EDU caused variable effects on leaf biomass production under conditions of low ozone in Experiment 2 whereas EDU generally increased leaf biomass when the plants were exposed to the relatively high concentrations in Experiment 1. The EDU-induced increase in leaf biomass production in this experiment did not vary between sites and was on average 5 – 7 %, depending on the harvest. The involvement of elevated concentrations of ambient ozone measured at the four sites in the Netherlands in 1994 in the observed increase of leaf biomass by EDU is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{tunnel boring}} {{machines}} (TBMs) is increasingly popular in tunnelling. One {{of the most}} important aspects in the use of these machines is to assess with certain accuracy the effectiveness of the action of the discs on the cutter-head in the different rock types to be excavated. A specific machine, called an <b>intermediate</b> linear <b>cutting</b> machine (ILCM), has been developed at the Politecnico di Torino in order to study, on a reduced scale in detail in the laboratory, the interaction between the discs of the TBM and the rock: this machine allows a series of grooves to be cut on a rock sample of 0. 5 9 0. 3 9 0. 2 m, through the rolling of a 6. 5 -in. disc, and evaluation, during testing, of the parameters associated with the action of the cutting tool. The parameters measured during the tests were compared with the results obtained employing two analytical methods widely used for predicting the performance of TBMs: the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) model and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) model. The latter showed a greater ability to reproduce tests conducted using the ILCM. However, as with the CSM model, it does not allow the optimal excavation condition (the ratio, which minimizes the specific energy of excavation, between the groove spacing and the penetration of the disc), necessary for the correct design of the TBM cutter-head, to be identified. An example, based on a real case of a tunnel in Northern Italy, allowed a demonstration of how the NTNU model provides results in line with the measurements taken during the excavation and represents, therefore, a model that is able to reliably simulate both laboratory tests and the action of a TBM on site. The NTNU model, together with the results of the tests with ILCM targeted on the identification of the optimal conditions of excavation, may allow the correct dimensioning of the TBM cutter-head to be attained in order to effectively implement the excavation...|$|R
40|$|With fourth-order {{derivative}} theories {{leading to}} propagators of the generic ghost-like $ 1 /(k^ 2 -M_ 1 ^ 2) - 1 /(k^ 2 -M_ 2 ^ 2) $ form, {{it would appear}} that such theories have negative norm ghost states and are not unitary. However on constructing the associated quantum Hilbert space for the free theory that would produce such a propagator, Bender and Mannheim found that the Hamiltonian of the free theory is not Hermitian but is instead $PT$ symmetric, and that there are in fact no negative norm ghost states, with all Hilbert space norms being both positive and preserved in time. Even though perturbative radiative corrections cannot change the signature of a Hilbert space inner product, nonetheless it is not immediately apparent how such a ghost-like propagator would not then lead to negative probability contributions in loop diagrams. Here we obtain the relevant Feynman rules and show that all states obtained in <b>cutting</b> <b>intermediate</b> lines in loop diagrams have positive norm. Also we show that due to the specific way that unitarity (conservation of probability) is implemented in the theory, negative signatured discontinuities across cuts in loop diagrams are cancelled by a novel and unanticipated contribution of the states in which tree approximation (no loop) graphs are calculated, an effect that is foreign to standard Hermitian theories. Perturbatively, the fourth-order derivative theory is thus viable. The theory associated with the pure massless $ 1 /k^ 4 $ propagator is equally shown to be perturbatively viable.

40|$|The {{content of}} fatty acids (FA) in herbage is {{important}} for forage quality and animal-source foods, {{but there is a}} lack of knowledge on effects of agronomic practices, and on environmental factors related to seasonal variation in FA concentrations and FA composition. This research investigated the effects of N applications and forage cutting intervals in a factorial combination on FA composition of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). The research was conducted during 2 yr that evaluated early, <b>intermediate,</b> and late <b>cutting</b> regimes during various seasons. Positive effects of N application and negative effects of extended regrowth interval on FA concentration and profile were found that appeared to be consistent within periods and years. The total concentration of FA was 32 to 53 % higher in spring than in summer, and 18 to 25 % higher in autumn than in summer. A positive relationship (P < 0. 001; r 2 = 0. 84) between concentrations of total FA and N was observed within and across a wide range of samples. Concentrations of total FA and N were on average 30 % higher (P < 0. 001) in early-cut highly fertilized herbage than in late-cut unfertilized herbage. In generative canopies in late spring, the changes in FA concentration were related to differences in leaf blade proportion (P < 0. 001; r 2 = 0. 64). In contrast, in vegetative canopies the changes in FA concentration were associated with seasonal changes in solar radiation and temperature. Overall, applying high rates of N and harvesting perennial ryegrass after short regrowth intervals resulted in higher fatty acid concentrations in herbage...|$|R
