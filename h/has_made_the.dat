5|$|Although {{commercial}} {{areas are}} growing rapidly, agriculture remains {{a foundation of}} the economy in the rural areas of the southern part of El Hatillo.

5|$|Although railroads {{have lost}} much of the general-freight-carrying {{business}} to semi-trailer trucks, they remain the best means of transporting large volumes of such bulk commodities as coal, grain, chemicals, and ore over long distances. The development of containerization <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> railroads more effective in handling finished merchandise at relatively high speeds. In addition, the introduction of piggyback flatcars, in which truck trailers are transported long distances on specially-designed cars, has allowed railroads to regain some of the business lost to trucking.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal and Manchester United first {{played a}} {{competitive}} match in October 1894; as of May 2017, the two clubs have {{faced each other}} 226 times in total.

Wayne Rooney has scored the most goals in the fixture with 12, while Ryan Giggs <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> highest number of appearances with 50.

5|$|Australians Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist with Sri Lankan Kumar Sangakkara {{lead the}} {{individual}} fielding records.

Wicketkeeper Gilchrist <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> most dismissals in a single match and individual tournament, while Sangakkara has the most dismissals by a wicketkeeper in World Cup history. Australia hold several team records, including those for the most wins, the highest win percentage, the most consecutive wins; they were undefeated in the 2003 Cricket World Cup and 2007 Cricket World Cup campaigns.|$|E

5|$|Lynemouth's future came further {{under threat}} in March 2011, {{following}} carbon cutting measures {{announced in the}} 2011 United Kingdom budget. The government's plans meant that the station would cost an extra £40million a year, erasing Rio Tinto Alcan's profits on the station. This <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> station's operators consider the option of converting the power station to operate on biomass only to avoid the penalties. However, this conversion itself would cost 400 million euros million and then using biomass instead of coal would cost an additional £170million a year.|$|E

5|$|Restoring {{the stream}} <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> area, a two-hour drive from Phoenix, highly popular. As {{recreational}} use of Fossil Creek increased after 2008, accumulations of trash and human waste {{as well as}} damage to forests and stream banks became problematic. The Forest Service at times closes parts of Forest Road 708 (Fossil Creek Road) to limit danger from traffic jams. Campfires are prohibited between the Fossil Creek headwaters and the dry bed of Stehr Lake, and other restrictions apply. Since 2009, the Forest Service {{has been working on}} a comprehensive management plan for Fossil Creek.|$|E
5|$|Settled in 1666 by Puritans from New Haven Colony, Newark {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} European cities in the United States.

Today, Port Newark-Elizabeth is the primary container shipping terminal of the busiest seaport on the American East Coast. In addition, Newark Liberty International Airport was the first municipal commercial airport in the United States, and today is one of its busiest.|$|E
5|$|Shane Watson is {{the only}} player to lead most runs, most wickets, highest score, highest batting average, most sixes, most matches for a team.

Tanvir also has the best bowling figures in an innings: he claimed six wickets against Chennai Super Kings in a 2008 match, while conceding 14 runs. Mahesh Rawat has taken the most catches as wicket-keeper for RR, with 15, while Naman Ojha <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> highest number of stumpings: 7; Dishant Yagnik <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> most {{dismissals}} as wicket-keeper for RR with 18.

5|$|Since the Norse sources (including the skaldic verses {{which were}} the sagas' main sources) chiefly {{describe}} war-related matters, less is known about other events during the reigns of the early Norwegian kings. Snorri, for instance, wrote fifteen pages about Magnus and only two pages about Magnus' peaceful father Olaf Kyrre (despite Olaf's reign lasting almost three times longer than Magnus'). Modern historians have noted that this probably <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> image of kings like Magnus Barefoot one-sided (in Magnus' case, skewed towards his deeds as a warrior).|$|E
