Annex 3. <b>Identification</b> <b>charts</b> for stars in galactic open clusters. Annex 4. <b>Identification</b> <b>charts</b> for {{stars in the}} Magellanic Clouds. The Hipparcos Input Catalogue was constructed as the observing programme for the European Space Agency's Hipparcos astrometry mission. The requirements of the project in terms of completeness, sky coverage, astrometric and photometric accuracy, {{as well as the}} necessary optimisation of the scientific impact, resulted in an extended effort to compile and homogenize existing data, to clarify sources and identifications and, where needed, to collect new data matching the required accuracy. This has resulted in an unprecedented catalogue of stellar data including up-to-date information on positions, proper motions, magnitudes and colours, and (whenever available) spectral types, radial velocities, multiplicity and variability information. The catalogue is complete to well-defined magnitude limits, and includes a substantial sampling of the most important stellar categories present in the solar neighborhood beyond these limits. The magnitude limits vary from 7. 3 to 9 mag as a function of galactic latitude and spectral type, and there are no stars fainter than about V = 13 mag...|$|R

In this paper, statistical analysis was carried out on the data of Upper Paleozoic formation water in this zone, e. g. salinity, pH value and ion concentration. It is shown that the formation water in this zone is of CaCl 2 type. Then, the origin, types, controlling factors and spatial distribution characteristics of formation water were figured out by using core, mud logging, well logging and testing data, combined with the classification and evaluation results of geochemical characteristics of formation water. Besides, the logging <b>identification</b> <b>chart</b> of gas, water and dry layers in this zone was established. Finally, the occurrence and distribution laws of reservoir fluids were defined. The formation water of CaCl 2 type indicates a good sealing capacity in this zone, which is favorable for natural gas accumulation.

Free water is mainly distributed in the west of this zone, irreducible water in the east, and capillary water in the whole zone.

Color-magnitude charts show a distribution lying above the ZAMS by up to about 2 mag for both the circumstellar shell stars and those classified as rapid rotators.

40|$|Punctuated equilibrium, {{a theory}} of {{unexpected}} and sudden change arising out of evolutionary biology and paleontology, {{has been applied to}} decision sciences, physics, organizational theory, and group behavior but never to leadership emergence theories. The {{purpose of the study was}} to discover how leadership emerges during a period of punctuated equilibrium, a sudden and unexpected change event, using a naturalistic decision making framework. Thus, the research question probed how leadership emergence could be theoretically modeled in a critical event. This grounded theory study was particularly unique because it drew from, and helped unify the four scientific foundations of complexity science, leadership emergence, punctuated equilibrium theory, and naturalistic decision making. Data from 40 retrospective accounts, described in 15 interviews with critical incident intervention specialists, first responders, and wilderness leadership trainers residing in the northeastern region of the U.

Initial analyses employed a reflective coding matrix and a concept <b>identification</b> <b>chart.</b> Analysis of synthesized themes identified an event continuum model in which instinct, compassion, and responsibility served as motivating factors for leadership emergence that appeared in close proximity to the change event. Subsequent observable indicators of leadership emergence often included a sense of calm, quick situational assessment, and the tendency of individuals to ignore physical risk. This study found that punctuated equilibrium stimulated leadership emergence in individuals. The most profound implication for social change was that leadership arose in a time of need guided by compassion and a profound sense of responsibility toward one another regardless of formal position in the group...|$|E

The observations, which covered the whole area of M 33, were carried out by the Beijing Astronomical Observatory 60 / 90 cm Schmidt Telescope, in 13 intermediate-band filters, covering a range of wavelength from 3800 to 10000 ˚A. This provides a series of maps which can be converted to a multicolor map of M 33, in pixels of 1 ′′. 7 × 1 ′′. 7.

The distribution of magnitudes in the V band shows that the apparent magnitude of almost all the regions is brighter than 18, corresponding to an absolute magnitude of − 6. 62 for an assumed distance modulus of 24. 62, which corresponds to a single main sequence O 5 star, while the distribution of color shows that the sample is blue, with a mode close to − 0. 05 as would be expected from a range of typical young clusters...|$|R

The high photometric precision {{has resulted in the}} discovery of two new RRc stars, three eclipsing binaries, seven long-term variables and one field RRab star behind the cluster. A detailed <b>identification</b> <b>chart</b> and equatorial coordinates are given for all the variable stars in the field of our images of the cluster. Our data together with the literature V-data obtained in 1994 and 1995 allowed us to refine considerably the periods for all RR Lyrae stars. The nature of the new variables is discussed. We argue that variable V 12 is a cluster member and an Anomalous Cepheid. Secular period variations, double-mode pulsations and/or the Blazhko-like modulations in some RRc variables are addressed. Through the light-curve Fourier decomposition of 12 RR Lyrae stars we have calculated a mean metallicity of [Fe/H][SUB]ZW[/SUB] = - 1. 70 ± 0. 01 (statistical) ± 0. 14 (systematic) or [Fe/H]_{text{UVES}}=- 1. 67 ± 0. 01 (statistical) ± 0. 19 (systematic). Absolute magnitudes, radii and masses are also estimated for the RR Lyrae stars. A detailed search for SX Phe stars in the Blue Straggler region was conducted but none were discovered. If SX Phe exist in the cluster then their amplitudes must be smaller than the detection limit of our photometry. The colour-magnitude diagram has been corrected for heavy differential reddening using the detailed extinction map of the cluster of Alonso-García et al.

The high photometric precision {{has resulted in the}} discovery of two new RR 1 stars and thirteen SX Phe stars. A detailed <b>identification</b> <b>chart</b> is given for all the variable stars in the field of our images of the cluster. Periodicities were calculated for all RR Lyraes and SX Phe stars and a critical comparison is made with previous determinations. Out of four probable SX Phe variables reported by Dekany & Kovacs (2009), the SX Phe nature is confirmed only for V 80, V 81 is an unlikely case while V 82 and V 83 remain as dubious cases. Previous misidentifications of three variables are corrected. Astrometric positions with an uncertainty of ~ 0. 3 arcsec are provided for all variables. The light curve Fourier decomposition of RR 0 and RR 1 is discussed, we find a mean metallicity of [Fe/H]=- 1. 92 +- 0. 06 in the scale of Zinn & West from 19 RR 0 stars. The true distance moduli 16. 36 +- 0. 05 and 16. 28 +- 0. 07 and the corresponding distances 18. 7 +- 0. 4 and 18. 0 +- 0. 5 kpc are found from the RR 0 and RR 1 stars respectively. These values are in agreement with the theoretical period-luminosity relations for RR Lyrae stars in the I band and with recent luminosity determinations for the RR Lyrae stars in the LMC. The age of 13. 25 +- 0. 50 Gyr (Dotter et al. 2010), for NGC 5024, E(B-V) = 0. 02 and the above physical parameters of the cluster, as indicated from the RR 0 stars, produce a good isochrone fitting to the observed CMD.
