40|$|<b>Job</b> <b>polarisation</b> and {{increasing}} wage inequality is observed in many rich countries, including Germany. Both phenomena are well-discussed in international literature, though a link {{can only be}} observed in the U. S. I {{assess the impact of}} <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> upon wage inequality in Germany by benefitting from regional variation in <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> and applying distributional decomposition methods. Although wage inequality occurs nation-wide the dimension is profoundly larger in polarised labour markets, whereas two thirds of these differences can be explained by differences in the workforce. In contrast to the U. S., there are only slight hints of a direct relationship between occupational and wage changes. They fully vanish once accounting for shifts in skills within occupations. Eventually, the temporal patterns of <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> and wage inequality do not match, implying alternative reasons for the increase in wage inequality than occupational shifts...|$|E
30|$|While in the US wage {{polarisation}} {{has occurred}} hand with hand with <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> (Autor et al. 2006), papers based on European countries {{do not find}} the same result. Goos and Manning (2007) failed to find wage polarisation for the UK despite the strong evidence of <b>job</b> <b>polarisation.</b> Antonczyk et al. (2010) and Kampelmann and Rycx (2011) show little evidence of wage polarisation in Germany. Finally, Massari et al. (2014) study the European labour market {{as a whole and}} conclude that {{there is no evidence of}} wage polarisation. With regards to Spain specifically, there is no study exploring this phenomenon.|$|E
30|$|Goos and Manning (2007) {{discuss the}} link between <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> and overall wage inequality, but do not report {{evidence}} on changes in occupational wages which have {{been the focus of}} later papers on other countries.|$|E
40|$|To be in {{relative}} poverty {{is to be}} excluded from the normal activities and acceptable standard of living in one’s community. In order to determine whether poverty in Australia is due to involuntary or voluntary causes a detailed examination is undertaken {{of the causes of}} disadvantage and the groups on whom these causes are impacting. Poverty is defined as involuntary when it is caused by factors outside of individual control, or where choices are so limited that one cannot escape from poverty. Nationwide evidence and a case study of poverty in the Newcastle region suggest the following indicators of involuntary poverty: Structural unemployment, Excess of job seekers over <b>job</b> vacancies, <b>Polarisation</b> of <b>job</b> growth into high skilled and low-paid low-skilled work, Decline in social expenditure, Lack of access to affordable childcare services, Increased cost of further education, Mismatch of education with areas of job growth, Unequal access to the internet, Inadequate provision of public transport, Relatively low expenditure on health of low-income groups, Decline in bulk billing, Decline in availability of low cost housing, Below poverty line welfare payments, High effective marginal tax rates for welfare recipients entering paid employment. Secondary indicators produced by the above causes include the presence of cohorts of poverty and locations of disadvantage (postcodes of poverty). A statistical analysis of poverty in Newcastle shows that the variance in the log of odds of poverty between Newcastle’s suburbs is largely due to variations in cohorts of disadvantage and structural causes. This supports the hypothesis that the majority of poverty in Australia is involuntary. It is necessary that the government acknowledge that poverty is largely involuntary so that Australia can shift from a culture of blame to one of mutual responsibility. Government and community action is required to rectify the causes of involuntary poverty. This can be achieved through job creation schemes, sufficient compensation for the unemployed and other groups of disadvantage, adequate and affordable provision of infrastructure and services, such as public transport, childcare, health care, public housing and education. The result will be a more cohesive society with equal opportunity for all citizens and improved social and individual welfare...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new evidence}} {{on the evolution of}} <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> over time and across skill groups in the UK between 1979 and 2012. The UK has experienced <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> {{in each of the last}} three decades, with growth in top jobs always exceeding that in bottom ones. Overall, top occupations have gained over 80 % of the employment shares lost by middling occupations. The decline of middling occupations is entirely accounted for by non-graduates who have seen their relative numbers decrease and the distribution of their employment shift towards the bottom of the occupational skill distribution. The increase at the top is entirely accounted for by compositional changes, as a result of the increase in the number of graduates since the 1990 s. Employment has not polarised for graduates, but has become less concentrated in top occupations, especially in the 2000 s. The paper also documents that <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> has not been matched by wage polarisation across the occupational distribution in any decade and discusses how these new findings relate to the existing evidence for the US and to the prevailing technology-based explanation for <b>job</b> <b>polarisation.</b> Overall, the importance of occupational changes between skill groups and the performance of occupational wages over time cast doubts on the role of technology as the main driver of polarisation in the UK. In particular, the evidence suggests that supply-side changes are likely to be important factors in explaining why high-skill occupations continued to grow in the 2000 s even as they stalled in the US...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{changes in}} the occupation structure in Australia between 1966 and 2011, {{and the effect of}} these changes on the earnings distribution. Occupation changes exhibited <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> (growth in high and low skill jobs, declines in middle skill jobs) in the 1980 s and 1990 s and general upskilling in the 1970 s and 2000 s. Any <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> has been primarily a male phenomenon. Occupation changes were consistent with the loss of jobs that were high in routine task intensity. Changes in occupational composition and associated earnings changes contributed significantly to growth in overall earnings inequality from the mid- 1980 s to the mid- 2000 s.

30|$|Recent {{studies have}} pointed to the {{importance}} of international trade more widely. In particular, Autor et al. (2015) and Keller and Utar (2016) have shown that increasing import penetration from China (to the US and Denmark respectively) has contributed to <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> by accelerating the decline of manufacturing employment.|$|E
30|$|Fernández-Macías (2012) criticises this classification, {{arguing that}} a {{division}} in even groups would {{not lead to}} <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> in Europe. Our results remain invariant to this alternative classification. I still observe the polarisation pattern with middle-occupations exhibiting relative declining shares {{with respect to the}} top and the bottom.|$|E
30|$|As {{discussed}} in Sect.  2, the US {{is the country}} on {{which most of the}} existing literature on <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> has focused. As it is customary in related papers (Green and Sand 2015, Antonczyk et al. 2018), it is therefore useful to refer to the US results when discussing those of other countries. This paper shows that the evolution of <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> in the UK appears substantially different from that documented for the US in previous literature. While employment growth in the US has progressively favoured bottom occupations and was only polarised in the 1990 s, in the UK polarisation occurred {{in each of the last}} three decades and growth in high-skill occupations has always exceeded that in low skill ones. Overall, between 1979 and 2012, top occupations gained about 16 of the 19  pp of employment shares lost by middling occupations.|$|E

40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. This thesis investigates the in uence that international trade exposure {{has on the}} com- position of the labour force in the manufacturing sector in Australia between 2008 and 2013. In particular we investigate whether the phenomenon of <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> is present within the industry, and whether increased trade exposure contributes to this. Thus {{we have had to}} carefully map employment data with trade data. Our panel data xed e ects estimation suggests that <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> does not exist within the manufacturing sector. This does not rule out its existence when accounting for the entire labour force however. The most significant finding is that increased exposure to trade leads to a movement of labour down the wage distribution. Such a finding has the potential to have significant policy implications.

30|$|Understanding the {{evolution}} of tasks measures across time allow further analysis of <b>job</b> <b>polarisation.</b> The composition of tasks constitutes a vital piece of information for testing the routinisation hypothesis. I analyse changes in the task structure of the labour market to determine if task structure relies on the changes within occupations (i.e. the intensive margin) or between occupations (i.e. the extensive margin).|$|E
30|$|Goos and Manning (2007) {{were the}} first to propose a link between <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> and {{technological}} change. They argued that the hollowing out of the UK labour market is due to the concentration in middling occupations of “routine” tasks which are easier to automate because they can be executed following a precise set of standard instructions (Autor et al. 2003).|$|E
3000|$|<b>Job</b> <b>polarisation</b> {{refers to}} the {{relative}} job growth in the lower and upper tail of the wage distribution relative to the middle-wage ones. This well-known phenomenon {{has been found in}} the US (Wright and Dwyer 2003; Autor, Katz, and Kearney. 2006; Autor and Dorn 2013), the UK (Goos and Manning 2007; Salvatori 2015), Germany (Spitz-Oener 2006; Dustmann et al. 2009; Kampelmann and Rycx 2011), and Sweden (Adermon and Gustavsson 2015). With respect to Europe, results are more controversial. On the one hand, Goos et al. (2009, 2014) show that on average, the employment structure in Europe polarised from 1993 to 2006. On the other hand, Fernández-Macías (2012) find heterogeneous results in Western European countries and conclude {{that there is not a}} clear and universal pattern of a pervasive polarisation. 3 As for Spain, conclusions also diverge between <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> (Anghel et al. 2014) and occupational upgrading (Oesch and Rodríguez-Menés 2011; and Eurofound 2015). 4 [...]...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new evidence}} {{on the evolution of}} <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> in Spain between 1994 and 2014. After showing the U-shaped relationship between employment share growth and job’s percentile in the wage distribution, I use the task approach to investigate the main determinants behind <b>job</b> <b>polarisation.</b> Using the European Working Condition Survey I analyse in detail the task content of the jobs which display the most significant employment changes. I show that changes in employment shares are negatively related to the initial level of routine. I then explore the impact of computerisation on routine task inputs and I find that the routine measure is negatively related to computerisation. Finally, by using information on past jobs, I provide {{evidence on the}} displacement of middle-paid workers. Results suggest that they did not predominantly relocate their labour supply to bottom-paid occupations: while non-graduate middle workers move towards bottom occupations, graduate middle employees shift towards top occupations. This fact suggests that supply-side changes are important factors in explaining the expansion at the lower and upper tail of the employment distribution.|$|E
30|$|Focusing on the Spanish case, {{this paper}} makes several {{contributions}} {{to the understanding of}} the evolution of the employment and wage structure in four complementary ways. First, I shed some light on the literature on employment polarisation in Spain, providing evidence of <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> in our sample; between 1994 and 2014, employment share in Spain increased at the two extremes of the job wage distribution, while it decreased for middle-income earners. My study adds to the literature on <b>job</b> <b>polarisation,</b> offering two new ways of representing the phenomenon and enlarging the period of analysis. 1 I also contribute to widening the literature on employment remuneration in line with employment trends. In the US, Autor and Dorn (2013) find a clear correspondence between employment and wages. However, the polarisation of wages does not seem to be common in Spain, as there is no evidence that changes in pay followed the same pattern as changes in occupations. This contrasts with standard labour markets models, predicting that a positive demand shock increases both employment and earnings.|$|E
40|$|We set up {{a general}} {{equilibrium}} model, in which offshoring to a low-wage country can lead to <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> in the high-wage country. <b>Job</b> <b>polarisation</b> {{is the result of}} a reallocation of labour across firms that differ in productivity and pay wages that are positively linked to their profits by a rent-sharing mechanism. Offshoring involves fixed and task-specific variable costs, and as a consequence it is chosen only by the most productive firms, and only for those tasks with the lowest variable offshoring costs. A reduction in those variable costs increases offshoring at the intensive and at the extensive margin, with domestic employment shifted from the newly offshoring firms in the middle of the productivity distribution to firms at the tails of this distribution, paying either very low or very high wages. We also study how the reallocation of labour across firms affects economy-wide unemployment. Offshoring reduces unemployment when it is confined to high-productivity firms, while this outcome is not guaranteed when offshoring is also chosen by low-productivity firms...|$|E
30|$|In summary, {{the results}} suggest that there is a {{relocation}} of middle-skilled workers. However, different from Autor and Dorn (2013) model, only non-graduate workers move towards bottom-paid occupations. This last result raises doubts as to the leading role of technology, indicating that {{more needs to be done}} to understand the main determinants behind <b>job</b> <b>polarisation.</b> Education plays an important role in explaining the increase at the two tails of the employment distribution.|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} economy gets {{a reasonably}} {{clean bill of}} health as far as polarisation between "good" and "bad" jobs is concerned. Overall Rececca Fauth and Ian Brinkley agree with recent analyses positing a stable labour market and continued expansion of well-paid jobs {{at the top of the}} labour market. With the exception of some remaining <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> for men, their findings stand in contrast to the hourglass economy story from the 1980 s that stemmed from deindustrialisation and the disappearing middle class...|$|E
30|$|The main drivers behind <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> {{are still}} subject to some debate; however, the main {{candidate}} {{is the so-called}} routinisation hypothesis (Autor et al. 2003, hereafter called ALM). Due to continuously cheaper computerisation, technology replaces human labour in routine tasks. This labour-capital substitution decreases the relative demand for workers performing routine occupations, while leading {{to an increase in}} the relative demand for workers performing non-routine tasks. Since routine workers are characterised as being {{in the middle of the}} employment distribution, then the hollowing effect is explained.|$|E
30|$|As widely {{recognised}} in {{both the}} labour and trade literature, changes in the skill mix of labour supply can lead {{to changes in the}} occupational structure as firms switch to production methods making a more intensive use of the more abundant factor. Dustmann and Glitz (2015) and Lewis (2011) exploit exogenous variation in the supply of immigrants to provide causal evidence that firms adjust production methods to changes in the supply of skills, but isolating exogenous variations in the supply of graduates has generally proven more difficult. 3 Recently, Blundell et al. (2016) argues that firms adjustment of their occupational structure to the largely exogenous increase in the supply of graduates over the same time period considered in this paper has led to stable educational premia in the UK. The literature on <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> has long acknowledged the potential role of changes in the skill mix as well. As mentioned above, Goos and Manning (2007) concluded that changes in the composition of the workforce cannot explain <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> in the UK between 1979 and 1999.4 It is therefore clear from the existing literature that changes in the skill mix of the workforce are a plausible driver of changes in the occupational structure that deserve empirical consideration.|$|E
30|$|To measure <b>job</b> <b>polarisation,</b> I use the 2002 wave {{rather than}} the other surveys, as my results remain invariant, which is {{preferable}} for two reasons. First, the 1995 EES does not include employees working in companies of at least ten workers, self-employed workers, and public employees. Second, between 2002 ESS and 2006 EES, I rather prefer the 2002 ESS, as it is closer to the initial period. Moreover, to measure wage polarisation, all five cohorts and all wages are deflated to the year 1995 using the Consumer Price Index (CPI).|$|E
30|$|One {{important}} observation can be {{made from}} this last result. While employment in Spain experienced a polarising trend at the occupational level between 1994 and 2014, the transitional analysis uncovers that the probability of switching for graduate middle workers {{to the top of the}} distribution significantly accelerates during the 2000 s, coinciding with the dramatic changes in graduate labour supply. Far from suggesting that technology does not matter, this last result highlights that understanding the main drivers behind <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> is more difficult than expected. Much remains to be understood, especially when making predictions about the future of jobs.|$|E
3000|$|I {{follow the}} same {{framework}} as Autor et al. (2003), and Autor and Dorn (2013) to estimate the effects of <b>job</b> <b>polarisation.</b> This classification {{is based on a}} three-dimensional typology: abstract, routine, and manual. To limit the role played by my subjective judgement, I follow the work of Autor and Handel (2013) as closely as possible, as they use variables that are most similar to those available in the EWCS. I construct the indexes {{for each of the three}} dimensions using the first component of a principal component analysis and then compute the indexes into their standardised form. 8 [...]...|$|E
3000|$|Later studies {{documented}} <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> in the US (Autor et al. 2006), Canada (Green and Sand 2015), Sweden (Adermon and Gustavsson 2015), Germany (Antonczyk et al. 2018; Kampelmann and Rycx 2011) {{and across}} Western Europe (Goos et al. 2009) {{and pointed to}} increasing global trade as a possible concurrent cause of the process. Studies that have compared the explanatory power of technology vs offshoring in explaining the decline of routine employment have generally concluded that the latter {{is more important than}} the former (Acemoglu and Autor 2011; Goos et al. 2014; Akçomak et al. 2016). 7 [...]...|$|E
40|$|<b>Job</b> <b>polarisation</b> {{instead of}} pure {{upgrading}} emerges in European industries. In this article, changes in employment are investigated at the sectoral level {{focusing on the}} International Standard Classification of Occupations relying on of four major professional groups: Managers, Clerks, Craft and Manual workers. The analysis covers 35 manufacturing and service industries of Germany, Spain, France, Italy and United Kingdom over 1999 – 2011 in relation to sectoral technological trajectories. A variety of dynamics emerges: relative upskilling is detected in manufacturing compared to skill polarisation in services suggesting the relevance of processes of structural and job changes at the sectoral level...|$|E
40|$|In {{debates about}} {{employment}} creation {{there is increasing}} concern about the quality {{as well as the}} quantity of jobs. The authors examine the regional distribution of workplace employment in the UK using the ‘quality of jobs’ framework. Findings reveal evidence of marked regional differences in average ‘job quality’, with the gap between regions growing over the decade from 1997, and the focus of high-quality job creation biased towards already advantaged regions. There is evidence of increased <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> across most UK regions. The analyses suggest an important role of the public sector in providing high-quality jobs, particularly outside London and the South East. ...|$|E
30|$|The first {{graphical}} method (Fig.  1) {{corresponds to}} the parametric graph. Figure  1 shows the evolution of Spanish employment between 1994 and 2014. As noted already, employment shares are measured by two-digit occupations (ISCO- 88) and by one-digit sectors of activity (NACE.Rev. 1). Earnings are measured by the logarithm of hourly mean in each job in 2002. The employment changes in Spain show a clear pattern of <b>job</b> <b>polarisation,</b> in which the higher and {{lower part of the}} earnings distribution increased while the middle-earnings part has shrunk. A U-shaped curve can be detected in the evolution of employment shares, when jobs are ranked according to the hourly mean wage.|$|E
30|$|In contrast, {{the most}} {{prominent}} theory accounting for <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> is the well-known routinisation hypothesis, called Routine Biased Technical Change (formulated by Autor et al. 2003, RBTC). In their seminal paper, ALM propose a classification of tasks along two different dimensions: routine (as opposed to non-routine) and manual (as opposed to non-manual, or also called cognitive) tasks. Routine tasks are defined as those that “require methodical repetition of an unwavering procedure” (ALM 2003 : 1283). The cognitive dimension generally refers to tasks that require gathering and processing of information and problem solving (analytic), {{as well as those}} that need creativity, flexibility and communication in order to be performed (interactive).|$|E
30|$|The second {{representation}} {{method is}} by defining job wage percentile. 15 In this particular case, smoothing regressions are displayed {{rather than the}} actual data point (the previous case). Therefore, changes in employment share are plotted against the percentile of the initial earnings distribution. A U-shaped curve is detected and shown in Fig.  2. The main advantage of this method is that the biggest increases and losses are observable. For Spain, the biggest losses are between the 20 th and the 40 th percentile of the initial mean wage distribution. Overall, the shape of employment changes in the EPA data confirms other studies with Spanish data and suggests that <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> is a robust phenomenon in Spain.|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that {{technical}} change has led to <b>job</b> <b>polarisation.</b> A relatively unexplored aspect of this is whether there has been a gender bias. This paper is the first to show gender bias in technology driven skill polarisation. Between 1997 and 2006 the demand for women shows hollowing out across high, medium and low education groups, as a consequence of technical change. This was not the case for men. Decomposing the fall in the gender pay gap shows further evidence for gender biased technological change. For moderate and complex computer users the fall in the gender pay gap remains largely unexplained suggesting gender biased demand shifts have significantly contributed to the closing of the gender pay gap. Gender Pay, Task-Bias Technology Change, Skills...|$|E
40|$|According to the forecasts, {{assuming}} a {{slow but steady}} recovery, up to 2020, the European economy will create some eight million new jobs. However, nearly 10 times as many jobs, around 75 million, {{will need to be}} filled as people retire or leave the workforce. Although there will be job openings for all types of occupations, most new jobs will be at the higher and lower end of the skill spectrum bringing a risk of <b>job</b> <b>polarisation.</b> Weak employment growth indicates that there may be an oversupply of people with high-level qualifications in the short term, but by 2020, Europe will have the most highly-qualified workforce in its history. This publication provides the data behind these trends and discusses the challenges they pose for policy-makers...|$|E
30|$|Finally, I {{analysed}} {{the role}} of <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> with the relocation of middle-skilled workers. To investigate this phenomenon, the main data source is integrated with two additional datasets: the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) and the European Survey of Income and Living Conditions (SILC). Taking advantage of these new databases, the analysis builds from questions on previous occupations. There are two main findings: {{in line with the}} ALM, middle-skilled workers become more mobile over time and have the highest probability levels of mobility. However, after dividing the data into graduates and non-graduates, results suggest that while non-graduate middle workers move towards bottom occupations, graduate middle employees shift towards top occupations. This fact suggests that supply-side changes are important factors in explaining the job expansion at the lower and upper tail of the employment distribution.|$|E
3000|$|Demand-based {{explanations}} for <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> imply that middling occupations should experience {{a decline in}} both employment shares and wages {{as a result of}} a fall in demand, generating both job and wage polarisation. This pattern, however, is only found in the US in the 1990 s (Autor et al. 2006; Acemoglu and Autor 2011), but there is no evidence of the contemporaneous occurrence of job and wage polarisation in the 2000 s in the US nor at any other time in any of the countries studied in the literature (Dustmann et al. 2009; Mishel et al. 2013; Autor 2015; Green and Sand 2015). 8 For the UK in particular, the working paper version of this article provides evidence that occupational wage growth has not polarised over time (Salvatori 2015). 9 [...]...|$|E
30|$|This section {{presents}} the main {{results of the}} shift-share analysis used to investigate {{the extent to which}} the changes in the composition of the workforce highlighted in Fig.  1 have contributed to <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> in the UK. As discussed in the Introduction, this method is very closely related to that used in Goos and Manning (2007) to argue that compositional changes do not explain the broad polarisation pattern. Here, the analysis is extended to include immigrants and the results are broken-down by different skill groups to highlight the contribution of each of them to different aspects of the overall polarisation pattern. This yield a new and more nuanced picture of the potential role of compositional changes than in Goos and Manning (2007), one that is also informative of the challenges and opportunities facing different skill groups.|$|E
30|$|As {{noted by}} Autor and Dorn (2009), <b>job</b> <b>polarisation</b> might be {{affecting}} different skill groups in different ways. Most (if not all) {{of the direct}} evidence on this issue, however, comes from the US where the decline in middle skill employment of non-college workers has mostly been compensated by increases in bottom occupations, while for college workers both low skill and high skill occupations have grown (Autor and Dorn 2009). No comparable evidence is reported in existing studies on Germany (Antonczyk et al. 2018; Kampelmann and Rycx 2011), Sweden (Adermon and Gustavsson 2015) and Europe at large (Goos et al. 2009, 2014). For the UK, in particular, both Goos and Manning (2007) and Oesch (2013) focus on aggregate results providing no evidence on the changing occupational structure within individual skill groups or on {{the contribution of the}} individual groups to overall polarisation.|$|E
