5|$|A 300-page iPhone bill <b>from</b> <b>AT</b> Mobility mailed {{in a box}} was {{the subject}} of a viral video made by YouTube {{personality}} Justine Ezarik, best known as iJustine, which became an Internet meme in August 2007. Ezarik's video focused on the unnecessary waste of paper, as the detailed bill itemized all data transfers made during the billing period, including every email and text message. Stories of unexpected billing issues began to circulate in blogs and the technical press after the Apple iPhone's heavily advertised and anticipated release, but this video clip brought the voluminous bills to the attention of the mass media.|$|E
5|$|A {{charter of}} 799 records a wife of Coenwulf named Cynegyth; the charter is forged, but this detail is {{possibly}} accurate. Ælfthryth is more reliably established as Coenwulf's wife, again from charter evidence; she is recorded on charters dated between 804 and 817. Coenwulf's daughter, Cwoenthryth, survived him and inherited the monastery at Winchcombe which Coenwulf had established {{as part of}} the patrimony of his family. Cwoenthryth subsequently was engaged in a long dispute with Archbishop Wulfred over her rights to the monastery. Coenwulf also had a son, Cynehelm, who later became known as a saint, with a cult dating <b>from</b> <b>at</b> least the 970s. According to Alfred the Great's biographer, the Welsh monk and bishop, Asser, Alfred's wife Ealhswith was descended from Coenwulf through her mother, Eadburh, though Asser does not say which of Coenwulf's children Eadburh descends from.|$|E

The lands were acquired by Robert de Beaumont, the Count of Meulan and later Earl of Leicester, in 1100.

5|$|A {{number of}} outside donor {{countries}} are also carrying out separate training programmes for {{various parts of}} the Forces du Terrestres (Land Forces).

When Kabila visited U.S. President George W.

The company is being supervised by Special Operations Command-Africa Command. The various international training programmes are not well integrated.|$|E

5|$|After the curacy {{was placed}} under the {{patronage}} of Christ Church, the incumbents were mostly scholars or members of the college; from 1616 to 1640 the curacy was held by Robert Burton, author of The Anatomy of Melancholy, who enlarged the church. In the English Civil War the medieval stained glass in the church was destroyed, {{partly due to the}} vandalism of Parliamentarian troops captured at Cirencester in 1642 and imprisoned in the church. Following the Restoration the holders of the curacy changed rapidly, often remaining in the position for only a few years at a time. <b>From</b> <b>at</b> least 1713 Christ Church leased a house in High Street to parish trustees and the profits were used for repairing the church. This continued until 1923, when the house was sold.|$|E
5|$|Although a ferry {{had almost}} {{certainly}} {{existed at the}} site of the present-day bridge since Norman times, the earliest known crossing of the river at Richmond dates from 1439.

However, due to the steepness of the hill leading to the shore-line on the Surrey side neither ferry service was able to transport carriages or heavily laden carts, forcing them to make a very lengthy detour via Kingston Bridge.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the market}} {{continued}} to operate, {{in the immediate}} aftermath of the plague it was at a much reduced level and many stalls were left empty for some years after. The famine of 1369 overwhelmed Norwich's burial grounds, necessitating an expansion of St Peter Mancroft's churchyard. The southernmost rows of stalls in the main marketplace, which had been occupied by drapers and linen merchants, were removed to clear space for an enlarged churchyard.

5|$|Beginning in the 1840s, European {{settlers}} cleared vast {{tracts of}} land for farming and grazing, further reducing kakapo habitat. They brought more dogs and other mammalian predators, including domestic cats, black rats and stoats. Europeans knew little of the kakapo until George Gray of the British Museum described it from a skin in 1845. As the Māori had done, early European explorers and their dogs ate kakapo. In the late 19th century, the kakapo became well known as a scientific curiosity, and thousands were captured or killed for zoos, museums and collectors. Most captured specimens died within months. <b>From</b> <b>at</b> least the 1870s, collectors knew the kakapo population was declining; their prime concern was to collect {{as many as possible}} before the bird became extinct.|$|E
5|$|Centuries {{before the}} conquest of Sogdiana by the Achaemenid Empire of Persia, Sogdiana possessed a Bronze Age urban culture that was {{gradually}} displaced by the Indo-European migrations of the Iron Age.

5|$|Compared {{with most}} sauropods, a {{relatively}} large amount of juvenile material is known from Apatosaurus. Multiple specimens in the OMNH are from juveniles of an undetermined species of Apatosaurus; this material includes partial shoulder and pelvic girdles, some vertebrae, and limb bones. OMNH juvenile material is <b>from</b> <b>at</b> least two different age groups and based on overlapping bones likely comes from more than three individuals. The specimens exhibit features that distinguish Apatosaurus from its relatives, and thus likely belong to the genus.
