5|$|Chelvanayakam was re-elected in the July 1960 {{parliamentary}} election {{in which the}} SLFP and its leftist allies achieved a majority in parliament. No longer needing ITAK's support in parliament, the SLFP reneged on its pledges to honour the B-C pact and commenced enacting anti-Tamil policies, announcing the <b>full</b> <b>operation</b> of the Sinhala Only Act from January 1961 and using Sinhala in courts of law throughout the country. ITAK launched a campaign of civil disobedience in January 1961, beginning in Jaffna. Chelvanayakam started distributing leaflets outside Jaffna Kachcheri in Old Park urging Tamil civil servants to boycott government offices and cease using Sinhala. The campaign was hugely successful and large crowds, including ITAK MPs, gathered {{in front of the}} Kachcheri and staged a protest rally.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the B Station began {{shortly after}} the A station was completed. The {{stations}} were built during {{a period in which}} there were great advances in power station technology, and in the scale of production, which led to them having a variety of intermediate generator set sizes along with a mix of design styles. Blyth A had a generating capacity of 480megawatts (MW) and the B Station 1,250MW. Their combined capacity of 1,730MW briefly made Blyth Power Station the largest electricity generation site in England, until Ferrybridge C Power Station came into <b>full</b> <b>operation</b> in 1966. The stations were capable of generating enough electricity to power 300,000homes.|$|E

By May 1946, studies suggested that the gaseous plants could fully enrich the uranium by themselves without accidentally creating a critical mass. After a trial showed this was the case, Groves ordered all but one Beta track at Y-12 shut down in December 1946. Y-12 remained in use for nuclear weapons processing and materials storage.

5|$|After the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project, it gave {{responsibility}} for the detailed design and construction of the reactors to DuPont. There was friction between the company and Wigner and his team. Major differences between Wigner's reactor design and DuPont's included {{increasing the number of}} process tubes from 1,500 in a circular array to 2,004 in a square array, and cutting the power from 500 MW to 250 MW. As it turned out, the design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional tubes came in handy when neutron poisoning became a problem for the B Reactor at the Hanford Site. The extra tubes allowed a greater fuel load to overcome the poisoning. Without them the reactor would have had to be run at low power until enough of the boron impurities in the graphite had been burned up to allow it to reach full power, which would have delayed <b>full</b> <b>operation</b> by up to a year.|$|E

5|$|Permission for Blyth A Power Station {{to be built}} {{was granted}} in February 1955, and its {{construction}} took place between 1955 and 1960.

Its first unit was commissioned in December 1962, {{and the rest of}} the station was fully operational by September 1966. The station had a total generating capacity of 1,730MW, the highest of any site in the UK until later in the same year, when Ferrybridge C Power Station came into <b>full</b> <b>operation.</b> Blyth B was the first power station in Britain to have 275MW sets installed. Its two 350MW sets were an intermediate stage toward the 500MW standard, so very few of the 350MW sets were ever commissioned in the UK. Both of the stations were designed by L J Couves & Partners. They were engineered by Merz & McLellan and built by the Cleveland Bridge Company.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedFor the U. S. Army, the fundamentally new concept of <b>full</b> spectrum <b>operations</b> requires that stability operations be internalized into its culture and operations. The main research question of this thesis is: How can the Army internalize <b>full</b> spectrum <b>operations,</b> including stability operations, into its culture and operations? Internalization specifies a cultural integration of stability operations represented by organizational attitudinal {{responses in the}} execution of <b>full</b> spectrum <b>operations.</b> The findings of this thesis are that <b>full</b> spectrum <b>operations</b> will be internalized in the U. S. Army under the following three conditions: 1) The National Security Strategy formally and consistently embraces {{the use of the}} military forces to conduct stability operations in support of national objectives. As addressed in Chapter II, this is the best method for prompting the Army to accept <b>full</b> spectrum <b>operations,</b> and specifically stability operations, as a permanent mission-set with the accompanying imperative to internalize it. 2) The Army doctrinally evolves the full spectrum concept, and devises a training model that supports operationalizing <b>full</b> spectrum <b>operations.</b> As described in Chapter III, addressing these imperatives requires the Army to rectify core issues such as leader development and the optimal force structure for <b>full</b> spectrum <b>operations.</b> 3) The Army is able to close the conceptual gaps in the whole-of-government approach to stability operations and overcome internal biases as represented by the current assignment and career development practices in the personnel system.
