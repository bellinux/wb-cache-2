Previous studies found an association of DS with - 48 C/T presenilin- 1 and with the - 850 tumor necrosis factor-alpha, two polymorphisms of genes involved in amyloid beta modulation In this study, we evaluated whether the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a protease involved in the degradation of endogenous brain-derived Abeta peptides, is involved in DS-related AD. To this end, 287 DS patients were compared with 251 apparently healthy controls, {{in order to assess}} the association between DS and two single nucleotide polymorphisms located on the introns 14 and 24 of the IDE gene. The comparison of allele and genotype distribution between cases and controls showed no evidence for an association with regard to IDE polymorphism, for both the SNPs (i. e., IDE 185 and IDE 199). In conclusion, the findings of our study suggest that the two IDE polymorphisms considered in the analysis do not appear {{to play a major role}} in DS-related AD...|$|R

40|$|Kawasaki disease (KD) is {{an acute}} febrile {{systemic}} vasculitis {{and has been}} reported to be associated with allergic disease. The risk of atopic dermatitis (AD) in preschool children with KD has not been investigated. The {{study was to determine the}} longitudinal risk of the development of AD in preschool children with KD. A nationwide 5 -year population-based study was performed using data from the National Health Insurance Database in Taiwan between 1999 and 2003. The risk factors for AD were compared between the 2 study groups during the follow-up period using the Cox proportional hazards model. In addition, plasma interleukin (IL) - 5 levels were analyzed in normal subjects and KD patients. Among the 1440 subjects included, 21. 6 % <b>developed</b> <b>AD</b> <b>during</b> the 5 -year follow-up period, of which 30. 3 % and 18. 7 % belonged to the study cohort and the comparison group, respectively.

40|$|Background: Identifying {{individuals}} {{at high risk}} of <b>developing</b> Alzheimer's disease (<b>AD)</b> is important for future therapeutic strategies, and there is a clinical need for diagnostic biomarkers to identify incipient AD. Objective: The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate if the AD-associated A beta peptide pattern recently found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could discriminate between patients with incipient AD and those with stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by analyzing CSF from patients with MCI at baseline. Methods: The levels of A beta(1 - 37,- 38,- 39,- 40,- 42) were analyzed by A beta-SDS-PAGE/immunoblot in CSF from 19 healthy controls, 25 patients with stable MCI and from 25 patients with MCI who later <b>developed</b> <b>AD</b> <b>during</b> 4 -to 6 -year follow-up. Results:All healthy controls and 20 out of 22 patients who <b>developed</b> <b>AD</b> were correctly classified by their baseline A beta peptide pattern. In 9 out of 25 stable MCI patients, the pattern indicated incipient AD in spite of clinical nonconversion. Interestingly, these individuals had apolipoprotein E genotypes and CSF levels of tau and phospho-tau that are known to be associated with high risk of AD. Conclusion: Altogether, our study reveals the novel finding that the A beta peptide pattern is able to predict AD in patients with MCI with a sensitivity of 91 % and specificity of 64 %.

40|$|Background In the randomized, {{controlled}} study Probiotics in the Prevention of Allergy among Children in Trondheim (ProPACT), maternal probiotic supplementation {{reduced the}} incidence of atopic dermatitis (AD) in the offspring. In the current study, we hypothesized that the effect was mediated by {{a shift in the}} T helper (Th) cells in the children. Objective To examine whether Th cell proportions were affected by maternal probiotic supplementation and thus could mediate the preventive effect of probiotics on AD. Methods A total of 415 pregnant women were randomized to ingest a combination of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb- 12 (Bb- 12) and Lactobacillus acidophilus La- 5 (La- 5) or placebo, and their offspring were assessed for <b>AD</b> <b>during</b> the first 2 years of life. Peripheral blood collected at 3 months of age was analysed for regulatory T cells (n= 140) and Th subsets (n= 77) including Th 1, Th 2, Th 9, Th 17 and Th 22. Results The proportion of Th 22 cells was reduced in children in the probiotic group compared to the placebo group (median 0. 038 % vs 0. 064 %, P=. 009). The difference between the probiotic and placebo groups was also observed in the children who did not <b>develop</b> <b>AD</b> <b>during</b> the 2 -year follow-up.

40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD), {{the most}} common form of dementia, shares many aspects of {{abnormal}} brain aging. We present a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) -based biomarker that predicts the individual progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD on the basis of pathological brain aging patterns. By employing kernel regression methods, the expression of normal brain-aging patterns forms the basis to estimate the brain age of a given new subject. If the estimated age is higher than the chronological age, a positive brain age gap estimation (BrainAGE) score indicates accelerated atrophy and is considered a risk factor for conversion to AD. Here, the BrainAGE framework was applied to predict the individual brain ages of 195 subjects with MCI at baseline, of which a total of 133 <b>developed</b> <b>AD</b> <b>during</b> 36 months of follow-up (corresponding to a pre-test probability of 68 %).

40|$|Background: Higher {{adherence}} to the Mediterranean diet (MeDi) may protect from Alzheimer disease (AD), but its association with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has not been explored. Objective: To investigate the association between the MeDi and MCI. Design, Setting, and Patients: In a multiethnic community study in New York, we used Cox proportional hazards to investigate the association between {{adherence to}} the MeDi (0 - 9 scale; higher scores indicate higher adherence) and (1) the incidence of MCI and (2) the progression from MCI to AD. All of the models were adjusted for cohort, age, sex, ethnicity, education, APOE genotype, caloric intake, body mass index, and duration between baseline dietary assessment and baseline diagnosis. Main Outcome Measures: Incidence of MCI and progression from MCI to AD. Results: There were 1393 cognitively normal participants, 275 of whom developed MCI during a mean (SD) follow-up of 4. 5 (2. 7) years (range, 0. 9 - 16. 4 years). Compared with subjects in the lowest MeDi adherence tertile, subjects in the middle tertile had 17 % less risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 0. 83; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 62 - 1. 12; P =. 24) of developing MCI {{and those in the}} highest tertile had 28 % less risk (HR = 0. 72; 95 % CI, 0. 52 - 1. 00; P =. 05) of developing MCI (trend HR = 0. 85; 95 % CI, 0. 72 - 1. 00; P for trend =. 05).

Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Northern Manhattan, New York, New York. Patients or Other Participants: Two thousand one hundred forty-eight community-based elderly subjects (aged ≥ 65 years) without dementia in New York provided dietary information and were prospectively evaluated with the same standardized neurological and neuropsychological measures approximately every 1. 5 years. Using reduced rank regression, we calculated DPs based on their ability to explain variation in 7 potentially AD-related nutrients: saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, ω- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, ω- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin E, vitamin B 12, and folate. The associations of reduced rank regression–derived DPs with AD risk were then examined using a Cox proportional hazards model. Main Outcome Measure: Incident AD risk. Results: Two hundred fifty-three subjects <b>developed</b> <b>AD</b> <b>during</b> a follow-up of 3. 9 years. We identified a DP strongly associated with lower AD risk: compared with subjects in the lowest tertile of adherence to this pattern, the AD hazard ratio (95 % confidence interval) for subjects in the highest DP tertile was 0. 62 (0. 43 - 0. 89) after multivariable adjustment (P for trend =. 01). This DP was characterized by higher intakes of salad dressing, nuts, fish, tomatoes, poultry, cruciferous vegetables, fruits, and dark and green leafy vegetables and a lower intake of high-fat dairy products, red meat, organ meat, and butter.

However, results from α-synuclein measurements in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been inconclusive, and to our knowledge, longitudinal studies of changes prior to the AD diagnosis have not been investigated. Methods Levels of α-synuclein at baseline and after one and two years were measured in CSF, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Twenty-six patients with early AD (AD-AD), 48 patients with aMCI, subdivided as 23 that <b>developed</b> <b>AD</b> <b>during</b> follow-up (MCI-AD), and 25 that did not (MCI-MCI), and 25 healthy control individuals, were included. One-way ANOVA was applied to compare mean α-synuclein baseline values between all four study groups, and a linear mixed model {{was used to compare}} mean change over time between the three patient groups. Linear associations between α-synuclein and amyloid-β 1 – 42 (Aβ 42), amyloid-β 1 – 40 (Aβ 40), total tau and phosphorylated tau were also examined. Results A large variation in individual α-synuclein CSF levels was observed, particularly in the MCI-AD group. No significant differences were found in mean α-synuclein levels between all the study groups at baseline. When using a linear mixed model, {{no significant differences were found}} at follow-up for estimated mean changes between the patient groups. MCI-AD patients with short duration of symptoms prior to inclusion in the study (≤ 2 years) had considerably higher mean CSF α-synuclein levels compared to patients with a longer symptom duration (802. 2 vs. 442. 8 pg/mL, p[*]=[*] 0. 01). No such difference was seen in the MCI-MCI or AD-AD groups. Significant linear associations (p[*]<[*] 0. 0005) between α-synuclein and Aβ 40, total tau and phosphorylated tau were found. Conclusion The observed difference in mean CSF α-synuclein level according to duration of symptoms in the MCI-AD group, may be an indication of changes related to disease progression. However, the lack of significant differences between groups, as well as the large individual variation in CSF levels of α-synuclein in the present study, suggest that α-synuclein is not a useful biomarker for AD...|$|R

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The study had 2 parts: a cross-sectional study involving patients with AD and controls to identify cut points, followed by a prospective cohort study involving patients with MCI, conducted 1990 - 2007. A total of 750 individuals with MCI, 529 with AD, and 304 controls were recruited by 12 centers in Europe and the United States. Individuals with MCI were followed up for at least 2 years or until symptoms had progressed to clinical dementia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs) of CSF Abeta 42, T-tau, and P-tau for identifying incipient AD. RESULTS: During follow-up, 271 participants with MCI were diagnosed with AD and 59 with other dementias. The Abeta 42 assay in particular had considerable intersite variability. Patients who <b>developed</b> <b>AD</b> had lower median Abeta 42 (356; range, 96 - 1075 ng/L) and higher P-tau (81; range, 15 - 183 ng/L) and T-tau (582; range, 83 - 2174 ng/L) levels than MCI patients who did not <b>develop</b> <b>AD</b> <b>during</b> follow-up (579; range, 121 - 1420 ng/L for Abeta 42; 53; range, 15 - 163 ng/L for P-tau; and 294; range, 31 - 2483 ng/L for T-tau, P <. 001).

40|$|Abstract Regardless of the Patient Self-Determination Act in 1992, only 15 % of Americans have {{an advance}} {{directive}} (AD). This {{will be an}} even more significant factor by 2030 when the expected elderly population will be 72. 1 million people. Purpose: If an individual {{does not have an}} AD, they may be subjected to futile, costly and unnecessary suffering at end-of-life. Loved ones may also suffer the emotional burden of not knowing what type of care is wanted if the person is unable to communicate. Primary care providers are first line in caring for patients and are in an ideal position to ensure that their patients have an AD completed. This should not be confined to the elderly, but anyone over the age of 18 as an unexpected illness or tragic event may occur. The literature is consistent concerning the emphasis on this important document but points out that it is not being done due to many constraints such as lack of education on ADs, discomfort with subject, time restraints and difficulty with accessing ADs in electronic medical records (EMR). Method: This quality improvement project seeks to have the AD flagged in the EMR to prompt the provider to have the conversation and easily document the results. One hundred and ten providers and thirty allied staff were involved in the project. Education concentrating on knowledge, comfort and legal aspects of ADs was provided to all staff. A community forum was offered to the public to provide information regarding ADs and its importance. At the start of the project, patients were asked to complete a card with a simple yes or no if their provider discussed completing <b>ADs</b> <b>during</b> <b>their</b> visit. Outcome: This project provided evidence of an increase in documentation due to the “flag “reminder. Education for the community and providers reinforced the importance of ADs. Conclusion: This project will easily be sustainable since the providers were educated on the benefit to their patients, their families and the facility. The flag will have prompted the conversation and documentation with the additional benefit of fulfilling Medicare and Meaningful use requirements.

40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{affecting the}} entire central nervous system including glial cells. The mechanisms of this disease are not yet entirely clear, although recent studies suggest that among the known hallmarks of AD, such as accumulation of amyloid β and hyperphosphorylated tau, dysregulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis is proposed {{to be a significant}} feature both in neurons and glial cells, namely astrocytes and microglia. Glial cells play an important role both in healthy brain and <b>during</b> <b>AD</b> progression. <b>Their</b> major functions, such as supporting neurons or maintaining synapses, are impaired during this disease. Recent findings suggest that aberrant glial calcium signaling activated <b>during</b> <b>AD,</b> could possibly promote the malfunction of these cells and increase their inflammatory response, thus affecting neurons and causing brain damage. It is likely, that the ongoing inflammation and the impaired calcium signaling affect one another, consequently enhancing the progression of AD...|$|R
6000|$|For {{this reason}} non-rigid reference-bodies are used, which {{are as a}} whole not only moving in any way whatsoever, but which also suffer {{alterations}} in form <b>ad</b> lib. <b>during</b> <b>their</b> motion. Clocks, for which the law of motion is of any kind, however irregular, serve for the definition of time. We have to imagine each of these clocks fixed at a point on the non-rigid reference-body. These clocks satisfy only the one condition, that the [...] "readings" [...] which are observed simultaneously on adjacent clocks (in space) differ from each other by an indefinitely small amount. This non-rigid reference-body, which might appropriately be termed a [...] "reference-mollusc", is in the main equivalent to a Gaussian four-dimensional co-ordinate system chosen arbitrarily. That which gives the [...] "mollusc" [...] a certain comprehensibility {{as compared with the}} Gauss co-ordinate system is the (really unjustified) formal retention of the separate existence of the space co-ordinates as opposed to the time co-ordinate. Every point on the mollusc is treated as a space-point, and every material point which is at rest relatively to it as at rest, so long as the mollusc is considered as reference-body. The general principle of relativity requires that all these molluscs can be used as reference-bodies with equal right and equal success in the formulation of the general laws of nature; the laws themselves must be quite independent of the choice of mollusc.|$|R

40|$|Amyloid-beta (A beta) {{pathology}} is a {{major component}} in the mechanisms behind Alzheimer's disease (AD). Measurement of A beta(42) in cerebrospinal fluid predicts cognitive decline in patients with mild cognitive impairment and identifies AD in patients with dementia. However, studies on A beta in plasma are contradictory. In this prospective population-based study, plasma A beta(42) and A beta(40) were measured at baseline in 730 adults aged 70 years or older and without dementia. After five years, plasma levels were analyzed again and participants were assessed for development of dementia. During follow-up, 53 individuals (7 %) developed dementia of which 37 (5 %) were classified as AD. No difference in baseline plasma A beta(42), A beta(40), or A beta(42) /A beta(40) ratio levels were observed between converters to dementia or AD compared to the cognitively stable individuals. However, individuals with plasma A beta(40) levels above the median level for the group at baseline had {{an increased risk of}} <b>developing</b> dementia and <b>AD</b> <b>during</b> the follow-up, even after adjustment for age, gender, APOE genotype, and educational level (odds ratio = 2. 2, 95 % confidence interval = 1. 0 - 4. 7, p < 0. 05). Neither plasma A beta(42) nor the A beta(42) /A beta(40) ratio influenced the risk of <b>developing</b> dementia or <b>AD.</b> Moreover, A beta(42) and A beta(40) levels increased over the 5 years, whereas the A beta(42) /A beta(40) ratio decreased (p < 0. 001). In conclusion, this study suggests that measurement of plasma A beta should not be used clinically to predict dementia or AD. However, plasma A beta(40) may possibly be regarded as a moderate risk marker comparable to other risk markers for AD such as first-degree family history of dementia...|$|R
