5|$|On 6 June 2005, the IOC {{released}} the inspection team's evaluation {{reports of the}} five candidate cities. Although these documents did not contain scores or rankings, the report for Paris was considered the most positive, followed closely by London, which had narrowed most of the gap observed {{at the time of}} the first-phase <b>evaluation</b> <b>in</b> 2004. New York City and Madrid also obtained very positive evaluations, while Moscow was considered the weakest bid. On the same day, New York City's bid suffered a major setback following the report that the State of New York refused to fund West Side Stadium, a New York 2012 centrepiece. The New York City campaign devised an alternative plan within a week, but such a major change with only one month remaining before the final vote damaged the city's chances.|$|E
5|$|The President must {{declare the}} office of Prime Minister vacant if the Prime Minister resigns his office, or if the President, acting in his discretion, is {{satisfied}} that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the confidence {{of a majority of}} the MPs. In the latter situation, the President is required first to inform the Prime Minister of his <b>evaluation</b> <b>in</b> this regard, and if the Prime Minister requests him to, the President may dissolve Parliament instead of making a declaration of vacancy. A general election must be held within three months after the dissolution of Parliament. This gives the former Prime Minister the opportunity to consolidate support by receiving a fresh mandate at the polls.|$|E

5|$|The XSBF-1—piloted by {{test pilot}} Bud Gillies—flew {{for the first}} time on December 24, 1935. Following initial testing, which found the {{aircraft}} to be reasonably faultless, the XSBF-1 was delivered to the U.S. Navy for <b>evaluation</b> <b>in</b> competition with two other biplanes submitted to the 1934 specification, the Great Lakes XB2G and the Curtiss XSBC-3. Unusually for biplanes, all three types possessed retractable landing gear. The evaluation showed that the design from Curtiss was superior to the Grumman and Great Lakes designs, and an order was placed for the Curtiss type, designated SBC-3 Helldiver in service, in August 1936.|$|E

A follow-up order for 38 in 1981 brought the totals to 98 single-seat F-5E and 12 two-seat F-5F, which were deployed in five squadrons headquartered at Dübendorf. Initially the Tigers were responsible for air sovereignty below , but some also took on a ground attack mission as the Hawker Hunters were phased out.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of highly {{sensitive}} mass spectrometers, an application of 231Pa as a tracer in geology and paleoceanography has become possible. So, the ratio of protactinium-231 to thorium-230 is used for radiometric dating of sediments which are up to 175,000 years old and in modeling {{of the formation of}} minerals. In particular, its <b>evaluation</b> <b>in</b> oceanic sediments allowed to reconstruct the movements of North Atlantic water bodies during the last melting of Ice Age glaciers. Some of the protactinium-related dating variations rely on the analysis of the relative concentrations for several long-living members of the uranium decay chain – uranium, protactinium, and thorium, for example. These elements have 6, 5 and 4 valence electrons and thus favor +6, +5 and +4 oxidation states, respectively, and show different physical and chemical properties. So, thorium and protactinium, but not uranium compounds are poorly soluble in aqueous solutions, and precipitate into sediments; the precipitation rate is faster for thorium than for protactinium. Besides, the concentration analysis for both protactinium-231 (half-life 32,760 years) and thorium-230 (half-life 75,380 years) allows to improve the accuracy compared to when only one isotope is measured; this double-isotope method is also weakly sensitive to inhomogeneities in the spatial distribution of the isotopes and to variations in their precipitation rate.|$|E
