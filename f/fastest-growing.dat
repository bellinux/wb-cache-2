5|$|Youngstown's downtown, {{which once}} underscored the community's {{economic}} difficulties, is {{a site of}} new business growth. The Youngstown Business Incubator (YBI), {{in the heart of}} the downtown, houses several start-up technology companies that have received office space, furnishings, and access to utilities.

The SRA operates under the guidance of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) and is the <b>fastest-growing</b> repository in the ENA.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} rural flight {{has not been}} spread evenly through South Dakota, however. Although most rural {{counties}} and small towns have lost population, the Sioux Falls area, the larger counties along Interstate 29, the Black Hills, and many Indian reservations have all gained population. As the reservations have exercised more sovereignty, some Sioux have returned to them from urban areas. Lincoln County near Sioux Falls was the seventh <b>fastest-growing</b> county (by percentage) in the United States in 2010. The growth in these areas has compensated for losses {{in the rest of}} the state. South Dakota's total population continues to increase steadily, albeit at a slower rate than the national average.|$|E
