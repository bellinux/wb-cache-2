25|$|Between 1939 and 1944 {{the synagogue}} {{was used by}} the Nazis as a storehouse. After a new synagogue was built nearby, the {{building}} became a museum for the town history, including Judaica and Jewish-related artifacts. In September 1961, a plaque was put on the outer wall of the building commemorating its former use and the annihilated Jewish community that used to live there. On July 4, 2014 the synagogue was sprayed in graffiti containing anti-Jewish remarks. (<b>For</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the synagogue see external links).|$|E

25|$|Soldiers of the Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa) were persecuted {{and imprisoned}} by Russian forces {{as a matter}} of course. Most victims were {{deported}} to the gulags in the Donetsk region. In 1945 alone, the number of members of the Polish Underground State who were deported to Siberia and various labor camps in the Soviet Union reached 50,000. Units of the Red Army carried out campaigns against Polish partisans and civilians. During the Augustów chase in 1945, more than 2,000 Poles were captured and about 600 of them are presumed to have died in Soviet custody. <b>For</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> postwar resistance in Poland see the Cursed soldiers.|$|E
25|$|The type {{of shell}} also affects {{the sound of}} a drum. Because the {{vibrations}} resonate in the shell of the drum, the shell can be used to increase the volume and to manipulate the type of sound produced. The larger the diameter of the shell, the lower the pitch. The larger the depth of the drum, the louder the volume. Shell thickness also determines the volume of drums. Thicker shells produce louder drums. Mahogany raises the frequency of low pitches and keeps higher frequencies at about the same speed. When choosing a set of shells, a jazz drummer may want smaller maple shells, while a rock drummer may want larger birch shells. <b>For</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> tuning drums or the physics of a drum, visit the external links listed below.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} two {{unmanned}} launches, eight solid-fuel ullage motors ignited for four seconds to give positive acceleration to the S-II stage, followed by start of the five J-2 engines. For the first seven manned Apollo missions only four ullage motors were used on the S-II, and they were eliminated completely for the final four launches. About 30 seconds after first stage separation, the interstage ring dropped from the second stage. This was done with an inertially fixed attitude so that the interstage, only 1 meter from the outboard J-2 engines, would fall cleanly without contacting them. Shortly after interstage separation the Launch Escape System was also jettisoned. See Apollo abort modes <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the various abort modes {{that could have been}} used during a launch.|$|E
25|$|A {{few meters}} after Pulilan Exit is the Candaba Viaduct (also known as Pulilan-Apalit Bridge). The bridge passes on a ricefields that are {{located within the}} {{municipalities}} of Pulilan, Calumpit and Apalit, and Pampanga River before the viaduct ends. (<b>For</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> a route description of the viaduct, see Candaba Viaduct). The expressway continues straightforward, passes through Shell and Caltex service areas, San Simon Exit (where the said transmission line re-enters the expressway before early 2011), Abacan and San Fernando Rivers, Cosunjumi Street, and San Fernando Exit. Before San Fernando Exit, the Mexico-Hermosa of NGCP crosses the expressway while on the exit itself exits the Hermosa-Balintawak transmission line. Between San Simon and San Fernando Exits, the Mexico-Balintawak transmission line again crosses the expressway. The SM City Pampanga and Robinsons malls are seen from the expressway.|$|E
