5|$|In 2008, solar {{electricity}} was not cost competitive with bulk, baseload power. However, it <b>does</b> <b>provide</b> electricity {{when and where}} power is most limited and most expensive, which is a strategic contribution. Solar electricity mitigates the risk of fuel-price volatility and improves grid reliability. Since then costs have decreased to make {{solar electricity}} increasingly competitive.|$|E

An amended complaint was {{filed by the}} three franchises a month later. In response to a motion to dismiss filed by the parent company, the judge ruled in January 2009 in favor of Burger King.

After purchase of the company by 3G, Burger King conceded to the franchises request the mandate be changed to a recommendation and relaxed its position on the extended hours.|$|E

5|$|Most insects, however, lead short {{lives as}} adults, and rarely {{interact}} {{with one another}} except to mate or compete for mates. A small number exhibit some form of parental care, where they will at least guard their eggs, and sometimes continue guarding their offspring until adulthood, and possibly even feeding them. Another simple form of parental care is to construct a nest (a burrow or an actual construction, either of which may be simple or complex), store provisions in it, and lay an egg upon those provisions. The adult does not contact the growing offspring, but it nonetheless <b>does</b> <b>provide</b> food. This sort of care is typical for most species of bees and various types of wasps.|$|E
