The ability to provide such search and rescue coordination was considered by IMO when the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) regulations were being developed. The basic legal requirements {{are to be found}} in the proceedings of the International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), held in London in 1974, and amended by the Conference on the Global Maritime Distress and Safety Systems (GMDSS), held in London 1988. In the framework of the SOLAS Convention regulations, from the 1 st August 1993, all SOLAS passenger vessels and all cargo vessels of 300 Tons gross tons and above will have to be equipped with a float-free <b>Emergency</b> <b>Position</b> <b>Indication</b> Radio Beacon (EPIRB) which communicates via satellite.

40|$|During the {{re-entry}} {{phase of}} a manned satellite, some equipment for continuous on-board <b>indication</b> of <b>position</b> will be required. Since radio and radar may be useless during part of the re-entry, inertial guidance equipment may be required. Such equipment, however, has an inherent instability in the computation of altitude. The present study of an inertial guidance system shows that for reasonable values of initial-condition errors and equipment biases. the resultant <b>position</b> <b>indication</b> errors will not become excessive unless the re-entry maneuver time is greater than 45 minutes to an hour. Further, the <b>position</b> <b>indication</b> error caused by accelerometer uncertainties can be reduced by switching off the accelerometers until their output becomes significantly greater than their uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|Ericsson is {{developing}} a new technology for accurate indoor positioning, named the HIP-solution. The HIP-solution is a joint product with areas of use in both the public safety market for <b>emergency</b> <b>positioning</b> and as a commercial platform for location based services. The {{driving force behind the}} development of Ericsson's HIP solution is E 911, a legal requirement imposed in theU. S. where operators are required to <b>position</b> an <b>emergency</b> call within a radius of 50 - 300 meter, depending on available positioning technology. Location Based Services (LBS) are the other important market for the HIP-solution where the technology can be used to offer customized services for mobile users based on their location, such as guidance to the nearest banking cash machine, or whereabouts of friends or family.    This master thesis is conducted at Ericsson, with the purpose of evaluate the HIP-solutions U. S market potential. The theoretical framework used in this paper is the Real Option Pricing Theory, with emphasis on the Expand Option.
