The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.|$|E
5|$|Alkali metal cations do {{not usually}} form {{coordination}} complexes with simple Lewis bases {{due to their}} low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li+ ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less (though exceptions occur for weak complexes). Lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits coordination numbers from 1 to 12, although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode. In aqueous solution, the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes (+), {{with the exception of}} the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes (+); the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules. Because of this, anhydrous salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as desiccants. Alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers (e.g. 12-crown-4 for Li+, 15-crown-5 for Na+, 18-crown-6 for K+, and 21-crown-7 for Rb+) and cryptands due to <b>electrostatic</b> <b>attraction.</b>|$|E

25|$|Charge is the {{fundamental}} property of forms of matter that exhibit <b>electrostatic</b> <b>attraction</b> or repulsion {{in the presence of}} other matter. Electric charge is a characteristic property of many subatomic particles. The charges of free-standing particles are integer multiples of the elementary charge e; we say that electric charge is quantized.

Robert Millikan's oil drop experiment demonstrated this fact directly, and measured the elementary charge.|$|E
25|$|An {{ionic bond}} is formed when a metal loses {{one or more}} of its electrons, {{becoming}} a positively charged cation, and the electrons are then gained by the non-metal atom, becoming a negatively charged anion. The two oppositely charged ions attract one another, and the ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between them. For example, sodium (Na), a metal, loses one electron to become an Na+ cation while chlorine (Cl), a non-metal, gains this electron to become Cl−. The ions are held together due to <b>electrostatic</b> <b>attraction,</b> and that compound sodium chloride (NaCl), or common table salt, is formed.|$|E

In a bulk material, all the bonding requirements (be they ionic, covalent or metallic) of the constituent atoms of the material are filled by other atoms in the material. However, atoms {{on the surface of the}} adsorbent are not wholly surrounded by other adsorbent atoms and therefore can attract adsorbates. The exact nature of the bonding depends on the details of the species involved, but the adsorption process is generally classified as physisorption (characteristic of weak van der Waals forces) or chemisorption (characteristic of covalent bonding). It may also occur due to <b>electrostatic</b> <b>attraction.</b>|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 74 - 80). Many organisms including mammalians use Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) {{which are also}} called Host Defense Peptides against microbial organisms. AMPs are among one of the ancient and successful strategies for both plant and animal kingdoms. Even though AMPs vary among closely related species and despite they have different sequences, many of the natural AMPs share similar properties. They are mostly short sequenced, structurally amphipathic and they carry overall net positive charge. Cationic AMPs target bacterial membranes because of the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>attractions</b> between positively charged peptides and negatively charged membranes. Due to the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>attractions,</b> cationic AMPs might work on membrane disruption by passing a certain threshold concentration for hydrophobic groups to penetrate into membrane. Noncovalent interactions and electrostatic interactions can create molecular attractions and may cause molecular self-assembly which is a common mechanism used by nature for several tasks. Self-assembling peptide amphiphiles are a group of molecules which can form nanofibrous structures and may contain bioactive epitopes depending on {{the target of the}} peptide amphiphile molecule. This thesis describes the presentation of antimicrobial sequences on supramolecular nanofibers which are formed by self-assembling peptides.

40|$|The enzyme glucose- 6 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (G 6 PD) {{plays an}} important role in maintaining the level of NADPH and in producing pentose phosphates for nucleotide biosynthesis. It is also of great value as an analytical reagent, being used in various quantitative assays. In searching for new strategies to purify this enzyme, the partitioning of G 6 PD in two-phase aqueous mixed (nonionic/cationic) micellar systems was investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Our results indicate that the use of a two-phase aqueous mixed micellar system composed of the nonionic surfactant C 10 E 4 (n-decyl tetra(ethylene oxide)) and the cationic surfactant C(n) TAB (alkyltrimethylammonium bromide, n = 8, 10, or 12) can improve significantly the partitioning behavior of G 6 PD relative to that obtained in the two-phase aqueous C 10 E 4, micellar system. This improvement can be attributed to <b>electrostatic</b> <b>attractions</b> between the positively charged mixed (nonionic/cationic) micelles and the net negatively charged enzyme G 6 PD, resulting in the preferential partitioning of G 6 PD to the top, mixed micellerich phase of the two-phase aqueous mixed micellar systems. The effect of varying the cationic surfactant tail length (n = 8, 10, and 12) on the denaturation and partitioning behavior of G 6 PD in the C 10 E 4 /C(n) TAB/buffer system was investigated. It was found that C,TAB is the least denaturing to G 6 PD, followed by C(10) TAB and C(12) TAB. However, the C 10 E 4 /C(12) TAB/buffer system generated stronger <b>electrostatic</b> <b>attractions</b> with the net negatively charged enzyme G 6 PD than the C 10 E 4 / C(10) TAB/buffer and the C 10 E 4 /C(8) TAB/buffer systems, when using the same amount of cationic surfactant. Overall, the two-phase aqueous mixed (C 10 E 4 /C(10) TAB) micellar system yielded the highest G 6 PD partition coeficient of 7. 7, with a G 6 PD yield in the top phase of 71 %, providing the optimal balance between the denaturing effect and the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>attractions</b> for the three cationic surfactants examined. A recently developed theoretical framework to predict protein partition coefficients in two-phase aqueous mixed (nonionic/ionic) micellar systems was implemented, and the theoretically predicted G 6 PD partition coefficients were found to be in reasonable quantitative agreement with the experimentally measured ones.

In this T-shaped/butterfly model, a deep hydrophobic cleft exists near {{the surface of the}} β-tubulin where three potential hydrogen bonds and multiple hydrophobic contacts bind to docetaxel. The hydrophobic pocket walls contain helices H1, H6, H7 and a loop between H6 and H7 that form hydrophobic interactions with the 3’-benzamido phenyl, 3’-phenyl, and the 2-benzoyl phenyl of docetaxel. 3’-phenyl also has contact with β-sheets B8 and B10.

Several interlayer cation radii were compared and found to increase in the following order: Li+[*]<[*]Na+[*]<[*]K+. The interlayer cations of laponite were determined as Na+ and Li+ (Table  3). Due to small radius and high hydration energy of Na+ and Li+, more water molecules could easily be adsorbed on the surfaces of laponite particles.

Rarely, at a temperature of around , snowflakes can form in threefold symmetry — triangular snowflakes. The most common snow particles are visibly irregular, although near-perfect snowflakes may be more common in pictures because they are more visually appealing.

In contrast, urea denaturation showed that the [urea] 1 / 2 values proportionately decreased with the stepwise change from 20 <b>electrostatic</b> <b>attractions</b> to 20 repulsions (20 A, 7. 4 M; 15 A 5 R, 5. 4 M; 10 A 10 R, 3. 2 M; and 20 R, 1. 4 M), and the delta delta Gu values correspondingly increased with the increasing differences in electrostatic interactions (20 A- 15 A 5 R, 1. 5 kcal/mol; 20 A- 10 A 10 R, 3. 7 kcal/mol; and 20 A- 20 R, 5. 8 kcal/mol).
