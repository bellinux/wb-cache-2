2500|$|Seid {{and his men}} {{express their}} {{feelings}} that Allah will protect them: Salve, Allah! tutta quanta / [...] "Hail Allah! All the earth resounds with his mighty name". A slave asks the Pasha if a Dervish who has apparently escaped from the corsairs might be admitted. Seid [...] grants an audience and questions him. Suddenly everyone notices flames at sea: the Pasha's fleet is burning. As the Dervish whips off his disguise and reveals himself to be Corrado, his corsairs invade the banquet, and a battle takes place. At first, it seems that Corrado and his men will win, but he makes a fatal mistake. Seeing that the harem is burning, Corrado decides to rescue Gulnara and the other women. This gives the Pasha and his men time to regroup. They take Corrado prisoner and Seid confronts him - Audace cotanto, mostrarti pur sai? / [...] "Yet so bold <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> before me" [...] - as he condemns Corrado to a grisly death, in spite of pleas from Gulnara and the harem to spare him for saving their lives.|$|E

6000|$|Corry Hutchinson gasped, and Pentfield {{left him}} and {{returned}} to the two women. Mabel, with a worried expression on her face, seemed holding herself aloof. He turned to Dora and asked, quite genially, as though all the world was sunshine:- [...] "How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> the trip, anyway? Have any trouble to sleep warm?" ...|$|R
60|$|MISS T. Then why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> always <b>stand</b> {{out after}} {{half a dozen}} turns? I thought {{officers}} in the Army didn't tell fibs.|$|R
6000|$|... "You devil!" [...] he cried. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> there {{grinning}} for? I'll {{give you}} something to grin about. Give me a stick, one of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{is to be}} the end of {{it between}} you and her?" [...] he asked me presently. [...] "Exactly on what terms <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> at present?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A snake may {{be small}} and weak, Edith, yet every honest man would place his heel upon it. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> back yourself, for my purpose is set." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So," [...] said Geoffrey, [...] "now {{we have it}} all. And <b>you,</b> sir, <b>stood</b> by and {{saw this}} <b>done.</b> <b>You</b> <b>stood</b> by {{thinking}} that you would make a profit of her agony. Now I {{will tell you what}} I meant to hide from <b>you.</b> I <b>did</b> love her. I do love her--as she loved me. I believe that between you, you drove her to her grave. Her blood be on your heads for ever and for ever!" ...|$|R

6000|$|She {{kept him}} a moment, while {{his hand was}} on the door, by not answering; after which she {{answered}} by repeating her question. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> to lose?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Three stripes were given, {{when the}} Captain raised his finger. [...] "You----,[3] <b>do</b> <b>you</b> dare <b>stand</b> {{up to be}} flogged with your hat on! Take it off, sir, instantly." ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{were all}} afoot now {{descending}} swiftly, {{and the horses}} ramped down the trail with expectant haste, so that {{in less than an}} hour from timber-line they were back into the sunshine of the lower valley, and at three o'clock or thereabouts they came out upon the bank of an exquisite lake, and with a cheery shout McFarlane called out: [...] "Here we are, out of the wilderness!" [...] Then to Wayland: [...] "Well, boy, how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh no, I won't hurt him,' {{replied the}} officer, tearing his jacket half off his back, in proof thereof. 'Come, I know you; it won't <b>do.</b> Will <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> upon your legs, you young devil?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Do you brave me? <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> me out, mistress? Answer. Don't {{look at me}} {{with those}} eyes as if you would bewitch me again! Sooner than that I die. You refuse to answer?" ...|$|E

6000|$|THE GRAND DUCHESS. Pshaw! How {{could they}} learn to read the Bible without {{learning}} to read Karl Marx? Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>stand</b> to your guns and justify what <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> instead of making silly excuses? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> suppose I think flogging a woman worse than flogging a man? I, who am a woman myself! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{the devil}} are you gaping at, men!" [...] he growled; [...] "did {{you never see}} a ship on her bilge before?

6000|$|... "What a shaggy, dusty horse! He's wild, too. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> let him <b>stand</b> {{that way}} without being haltered? I should {{think he would}} run off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>stand</b> in {{with that}} wicked corpse for, sir? He'll have you, too," [...] he ended, {{blinking}} his glazed eyes vacantly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you {{had better}} sign it, and we'll get Hastings to witness it in a minute or two. In the {{meanwhile}} there's a thing I have to ask you. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> in regard to Miss Ismay?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{made three}} of ’em run," [...] said Miss Rumbolt, [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>did</b> nothing. <b>You</b> just <b>stood</b> still, {{and let them}} take the ship. I’m ashamed of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Well, gentlemen,’ said Mrs. Parsons, ‘you {{are really}} very polite; you stay away the whole morning, after {{promising}} {{to take us}} out, and when <b>you</b> <b>do</b> come home, <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> whispering together and take no notice of us.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you a brute, or a fool, or both?" [...] she said, {{letting her}} temper loose. [...] "How long <b>do</b> <b>you</b> intend to <b>stand</b> there, doing nothing?" ...|$|R
