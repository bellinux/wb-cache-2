In May 2015 the joint {{review of the}} panels found that the banks had failed to fully comply with the standards to which they had committed themselves. While the banks took significant steps to understand the situation {{as part of their}} due diligence process, they accepted an indigenous peoples report that was insufficient for the purpose to approve the credit in January 2011, requiring further investigations as a condition for disbursement, while their own standards would have required a fully satisfactory report at the time of approval. The two banks accepted the conclusions and committed themselvees to [...] "further raise the bar on the required level of <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> available to (them) at the time of credit approval." [...] In the meantime, the government of Panama - since June 2014 led by a new President, Juan Carlos Varela - suspended the construction of the dam in February 2015 {{on the grounds that the}} environmental and social impact assessment was faulty pending the outcome of a court case that challenges the assessment. In June 2015 new protests erupted, with protesters shutting down the Interamerican Highway for two days, as a result of which the President sent a riot squad to the area. In August 2015 President Varela and the Cacia General of the indigenous Comarca, Silvia Carrera, signed an agreement to the effect that the civil works of the dam would be completed, but that the electromechanical works would remain suspended and the dam would not be flooded until a final agreement had been reached. GENISA complained that it had been left out of the agreement and that the agreement violated the agreements concluded by the state with the company. In September 2015 the environmental agency ANAM imposed a 775,200 USD fine on GEMISA for having failed to comply with the resettlement and compensation measures under the project. On January 21, 2016 the indigenous movement 10th of April claimed that the agreement had been violated, because tests to fill the reservoir had been made. On January 28, 2016, a technical report was presented to the indigenous communities, showing that the dam was technically safe. Furthermore, a sub-commission consisting of the government and traditional authorities was created to further study the impacts of the project in view of a [...] "final decision". Filling of the reservoir began on May 24th, leading to further protests and road blocks. In response, Vice-President and Minister of Foreign Affairs Isabel Saint Malo de Alvarado held talks with indigenous leaders early June 2016. Carrera said that the filling [...] "was a violation of the rights of indigenous people in the area, and of the contract signed by President Juan Carlos Varela." ...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{number of}} {{pregnant}} women with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 or more is increasing, which {{has important implications for}} antenatal care. Various resource-intensive interventions have attempted to assist women in managing their weight gain during pregnancy with limited success. A mobile phone app has been proposed as a convenient and cost-effective alternative to face-to-face interventions. Objective: This paper describes the process of developing and pilot testing the Eating 4 Two app, which aims to provide women with a simple gestational weight gain (GWG) calculator, general dietary information, and the motivation to achieve a healthy weight gain during pregnancy. Methods: The project involved the development of app components, including a graphing function that allows the user to record their weight throughout the pregnancy and to receive real-time feedback on weight gain progress and general <b>information</b> <b>on</b> antenatal nutrition. <b>Stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> was used to inform development. The app was pilot tested with 10 pregnant women using a mixed method approach via an online survey, 2 focus groups, and 1 individual interview. Results: The Eating 4 Two app took 7 months to develop and evaluate. It involved several disciplines [...] including nutrition and dietetics, midwifery, public health, and information technology [...] at the University of Canberra. Participants found the Eating 4 Two app to be a motivational tool but would have liked scales or other markers on the graph that demonstrated exact weight gain. They also liked the nutrition information; however, many felt it should be formatted in a more user friendly way. Conclusions: The Eating 4 Two app was viewed by participants in our study as an innovative support system to help motivate healthy behaviors during pregnancy and as a credible resource for accessing nutrition-focused information. The feedback provided by participants will assist with refining the current prototype for use in a clinical intervention trial. Full Tex...|$|R

[72] {{comparison}} of Paris and London, targeted <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> communicating knowledge <b>on</b> freight issues and priorities for action, as well as involvement in the planning process, are practised in the freight plans identified in this paper. This complies with the emphasis <b>on</b> <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> as key in urban freight planning [2, 10, 73, 74]. Collaboration is also highlighted as {{a key element in}} the SUTP, SUMP and SULP methodology fundamental to improvement of the planning procedures [74]. Key stakeholders involved in the identified planning process are: logistics service providers, suppliers, receivers, parish councils, road haulage operators and delivery companies, and heavy goods vehicle drivers [2]. In Västra Götaland, for example, a freight strategy reference group with representatives from municipalities, municipal associations, businesses, academia, research institutes, NGOs and government agencies is involved in the planning [31]. Freight plans are designed to best serve the needs of both the freight industry and local communities by consulting with local authorities, representatives of the freight and logistics community. The use of a collaborative approach is in line with Lindholm’s [20] conclusion that including all relevant stakeholders in the planning process secures acceptance, thus increasing the likelihood of the plan delivering its full potential benefit [39].|$|R

40|$|There is {{increased}} public pressure for governments {{to be more}} accountable for their actions. A particular area of concern relates to the trend of many governments to delegate responsibility for certain public services to agencies. This thesis develops a reporting model {{that can be used}} by public sector agencies to demonstrate accountability to their stakeholders. The model encompasses three main strands of accountability: financial reporting,Â· performance outcome reporting and <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation.</b> <b>Stakeholders</b> are identified using Clarkson's (1984) primary/secondary typology and are further delineated through Mitchell, Agle and Wood's (1997) salience framework. The prominence of financial reporting in a stakeholder reporting model is examined through a discussion of the application of commercial versus public sector accounting standards. Non-financial performance outcome reporting is a fundamental element of a stakeholder accountability model. Stewart's (1994) Ladder of Accountability is utilized to identify the various aspects of accountability: probity/legality, process, performance, programme and policy. An important element of accountability centers <b>on</b> <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> and involvement. The thesis employs Friedman and Miles' (2006) Ladder of Stakeholder Management and Engagement as an approach not only to elicit feedback from stakeholders, but to truly engage them in the accountability process. This research study examines how the conceptual frameworks, convergence of accounting standards, designation of a government orgaruzation as a government business enterprise (GBE) and the introduction of accountability legislation impacts the ability of an agency to adequately demonstrate accountability to its stakeholders. This study uses the case of the workers' compensation agency in the Province of Newfoundland, Canada to develop a stakeholder accountability model which addresses the needs of stakeholders. This {{is one of the oldest}} public sector agencies in Newfoundland, and it operates at arm's length from government owing to its legislative right to levy its own revenue to fund programs. Further, as it is a mandatory system for the funders (employers) and beneficiaries (injured workers), arguably it should be held to a higher level of accountability...|$|R

Two methodologies are proposed: canal rating equations, and outlet discharge equations. The methodology is applied to a tertiary canal located in the Punjab, Province of Pakistan. Fairness/equity is expressed quantitatively using the Gini index. There is {{a difference in the}} estimated discharge depending on the methodology employed, however as we move along the canal the water allowance does not vary significantly with the distance along the canal. Hence for this particular canal the head-middle-tail inequity often reported and generalized in the literature is not observed. The advantage of a quantitative measure of inequity such as the Gini is exemplified by comparing the Gini with that at the secondary canal and also against itself if the tertiary canal could be operated “as designed”. We introduce two new concepts: systematic and operational inequity.

In comparison with conventional thermal generation technologies, a coal-fired power plant with CCS requires either a 70 % higher on-grid electricity tariff or carbon price support of approximately US$ 50 /tonne CO 2 {{in the absence of}} any other incentive mechanisms or financing strategies. Given the difficulties of relying on any one single measure to finance a large-scale CCS power plant in China, we explore a combination of possible financing mechanisms. Potential measures available for increasing the return on the CCS investment include: enhanced oil recovery (EOR), a premium electricity tariff, and operational investment flexibility (e. g. solvent storage, upgradability). A simulation found that combining several financing options could not only provide private investors with a 12 % to 18 % return on equity (ROE), but also significantly reduce the required on-grid tariff to a level that is very close to the tariff level of existing coal-fired power plants and much lower than the tariffs for natural gas combined cycle and nuclear power plants. Therefore, we suggest that a combination of existing financing measures could trigger private investment in a large-scale CCS power plant in China...|$|R

40|$|Mollymook, Collingwood and Callala {{beaches and}} the {{communities}} living near them {{were identified as}} especially vulnerable to sea level rise by the Shoalhaven City Council. A number of possible engineering and management solutions have been identified for mitigating or eliminating the effects of expected flooding and erosion (e. g., sea wall, groyne, beach nourishment), based on guidelines developed by Engineers Australia. However, the question remains {{as to how to}} assess and compare the benefits (and not just the costs) of each option. While the cost of designing and implementing these options are reasonably easy to estimate, other environmental and aesthetic costs are more difficult to valuate. Even more challenging is quantifying in monetary terms the benefits of each option. Methods are available in the economic literature for estimating some of these parameters, however, their application requires data and resources that are not always available to local government. In this study, we propose a pragmatic approach (relatively simple yet detailed) which combines a monetarybased probabilistic flood-damage estimation technique with an estimate of non-monetary consequences of an adaptation option using local knowledge and <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation.</b> These two types of information (monetary and non-monetary) are combined using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods in order to generate a ranking of engineering adaptation options and assist in decision-making. We illustrate the method by applying to Callala beach in Shoalhaven. First, we calculate respective cost-benefit ratios of each option by simulating the likely effects of a flood event (with multiple probabilities of occurrence or return period) with and without proposed adaptation options, for different scenarios of sea level rise. Specifically, a flood model of Callala is developed using high resolution LiDAR Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data and tested for impacts under different sea level rise scenarios (using IPCC AR 5 projections) and their corresponding exceedance probabilities (using Canute sea level rise calculator). Second, we estimate the potential damage to properties and infrastructures (cumulative over time) through flood damage function curves (quantifying the relationship between flood depth and potential damage cost of private properties and public infrastructure). Third, we estimate the non-monetary benefits of each option using a simplified approach, based <b>on</b> <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation.</b> Finally, we use two different multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approaches (simple additive weight and outranking methods) for comparison of a number of engineering adaptation options (both hard and soft measures). Results show that, in general, a combination of beach nourishment & groynes is the most preferred option for Callala beach, across all decision analysis methods. Our analyses also show that hard measures such as sea walls tend to perform better in cost-benefit analyses where non-monetary factors such as community preferences, aesthetics and environmental factors are omitted. On the other hand, including these factors through MCDA methods seems to push sea walls down the rank. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentFull Tex...|$|R

The sensitively of livestock productivity was examined by using district level data of milk productivity of cow as well as buffalo for the year 1992 and 1997 for 100 districts which was regressed on important weather variables. The analysis shows that weather variables like rainfall and temperature do significantly influence the milk productivity of animals in rainfed regions. Increased climatic variability due to changing climate is likely to negatively influence the livestock productivity. Based <b>on</b> analysis and <b>stakeholders</b> <b>consultation</b> the paper suggests appropriate adaptation strategies particularly focusing on mitigating feed scarcity situations arising due to climatic variability...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The European Commission's Integrated Product Policy Communication, 2003, defined Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as the ‘best {{framework}} {{for assessing the}} potential environmental impacts of products'. Since then, the use of LCA and life cycle approaches has been developing {{in a wide range}} of European policies, and its use has also significantly grown in business. Increasing the availability of quality-assured Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data is the current challenge to ensure the development of LCA in various areas. Methods: One solution to increase availability is to use LCI data from multiple database sources but under the condition that such LCI data are fully interoperable. Results and discussion: This paper presents original solutions and recent achievements towards increased availability, quality and interoperability of life cycle inventory data, developed through European Commission-led activities and based <b>on</b> wide <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> and international dialogue. An overview of related activities, such as the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD), the European Reference Life Cycle Database (ELCD) and the ILCD Entry-Level quality requirements are presented. The focus is then on the Life Cycle Data Network (LCDN). Conclusions: A non-centralised data network of LCI datasets complying with minimum quality requirements that was politically launched in February 2014, already includes several database nodes from different worldwide sources and has the potential to contribute to the needs of the international community...|$|R
30|$|A {{compilation}} of existing abatement {{in the form}} of Intervention Database is under development [59]. This database will include <b>information</b> <b>on</b> both technical and non-technical abatement options based on qualitative and quantitative experiences of implementing abatement techniques gained so far. The approach in handling this database allows for continuous expansion of the abatement options, as well as their efficacy, as experiences with abatement approaches and efficacies grow. The non-technical abatement options may include ongoing advancements in, e.g. the development of green chemistry, substitution, ban and use restrictions of priority chemicals, as well as issues like education of producers and consumers. For technical abatement options, the database contains removal efficiencies of chemicals for given abatement techniques, which may thereby be expressed for indicator chemicals, but also for chemical mixtures and with links to effects as based on bio-analytical tools. Estimated or actual costs of each measure will be given room in the database. As the database contains abatement options which are taken by various sectors (such as health care, agriculture, industry, consumers), the concepts embedded in the database will also facilitate cross-sectoral learning and identification of novel abatement options. In addition to the contents described above, the database will also contain <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>stakeholders</b> and their potential roles in both causing and abating emissions. This will support the development of management options and to assess the ease of implementation of the selected abatement option and also to allow identification of “low hanging fruit”.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to utilize focus groups and {{individual}} interviews to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of augmentative and alternative (AAC) techniques in facilitating language in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as expressed by the opinions and attitudes of stakeholders involved in the process. ASD is a disorder that affects an individual 2 ̆ 7 s social and communication skills that usually surfaces within a child 2 ̆ 7 s first three years of life. There have been numerous studies conducted comparing different types of AAC intervention systems, but there is little <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>stakeholders</b> 2 ̆ 7 opinions. The current study utilized one focus group interview with five members. This group consisted of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) who have had children with autism and who use AAC on their caseload. The researcher also conducted four additional interviews; two with teachers who classrooms contained children with autism who used AAC and two with parents of children with autism. Several trends were found in this study. Trends arose that indicated that there was a decrease in behavior problems with an increase in communication with the use of AAC. Another major trend that arose was the need for more support of AAC-use from parents and teachers in order to aid in the generalization process. There was also a need for more AAC training for SLPs...|$|R
