2500|$|Immediately {{following}} the incident, Timberlake sounded unapologetic for his actions, telling Access Hollywood, [...] "Hey man, we love giving you all {{something to talk}} about." [...] Timberlake released a statement saying [...] "I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl. It was not intentional and is regrettable." [...] However, Timberlake was not required to film a video apology as Jackson was. Timberlake also addressed the incident at the Grammy Awards the following week, which Jackson was banned from attending after being scheduled as a presenter, saying [...] "I know it's been a rough week on everybody. What occurred was unintentional, completely regrettable and I apologize if you guys are offended." [...] Timberlake gave an additional interview at the Grammy event and stated, [...] "All I could say was, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'" [...] Timberlake said. [...] "I looked at her. They brought a towel up on stage. They covered her up. I was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as quickly as I could. I'm frustrated at the whole situation. I'm frustrated that my character is being questioned. And {{the fact of the}} matter is, you know, I've had a good year, a really good year, especially with my music." [...] Timberlake later declared, [...] "It was something that went wrong. Then I felt like, I'm going to show everyone that this was something that didn't affect me, and I'm going to show up at the Grammys." [...] He later said he was unable to attend most of the halftime rehearsals due to being on tour in Spain, having only one day to rehearse. While promoting his sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds over two years later, Timberlake expressed regret for his behavior, saying, [...] "In my honest opinion now ... I could've handled it better. ... I'm part of a community that consider themselves artists. And <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> I could have done in her defense that was more than I realized then, I would have. But the other half of me was like, 'Wow. We still haven't found the weapons of mass destruction and everybody cares about this!'" [...] He added, [...] "I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that says something about society ... I think that America's harsher on women. And I think that America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's very distasteful to me, Tom," [...] {{said his}} mother; and <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> else in her mind, {{she did not}} speak more plainly of it than to add: [...] "It's not only the kind of business, {{but the kind of}} people you would be mixed up with." ...|$|E

60|$|Stephen made no protest. For a time {{he smoked}} in silence.

Design/methodology/approach: used for the analysis has covered proposition of the supervision over measurement processes system {{that can be applied}} in quality assurance. Findings: of analysis are as follows: system of supervision over measurement processes performed (in compliance with real), realised in an organisation processes, can assure the achievement of the accurate and reliable results that, being the base of any feedback in any process, have fundamental meaning in making appropriate decisions. Practical implications: can be applied in case of any organisation, wanting to demonstrate the conformity of processes in the range of requirements that apply to: products, workers, natural environment and others by supervision over measurement equipment. Originality/value: of the presented paper has been obtained by working out the design of supervision over measurement system, also measurement system capability, which should be supplement for supervision over processes system in the assurance of processes and products quality...|$|R

If there was, heaven knows what it might have been, for their talk was {{ordinary}} enough. But Alvina liked to be with Miss Pinnegar in the kitchen. Miss Pinnegar wasn't competent and masterful like Miss Frost: she was ordinary and uninspired, with quiet, unobserved movements. But she was deep, {{and there was some}} secret satisfaction in her very quality of secrecy.|$|E
6000|$|On {{his return}} to the rectory, he merely said that he had been to see after various things {{belonging}} to him, which were still left in the empty house. His look and manner as he gave us this brief explanation were, to my mind, more unsatisfactory than ever. I made no remark; and, observing that his loose traveling coat was buttoned awry over the breast, I set it right for him. My hand, as I did this, touched his breast-pocket. He started back directly--as <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> in the pocket which he did not wish me to feel. Was it something he had brought from Browndown? ...|$|E
