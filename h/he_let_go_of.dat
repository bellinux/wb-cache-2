500|$|Chamberlain {{made his}} major league debut with the Louisville Colonels of the American Association on September 13, 1886. In early October, Chamberlain was {{pitching}} {{in a game}} against the Baltimore Orioles when Louisville players began to complain that opposing pitcher Matt Kilroy was leaving the pitcher's box when he threw the ball. When the umpire did not respond to Louisville's complaints, Chamberlain's manager told him to run forward out of the box when <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> his pitches. The move [...] "scared the Baltimore batters out of their wits" [...] and Kilroy did not deliver any more questionable pitches.|$|E
500|$|Another escape {{occurred}} in February 2004 when the girlfriend of an inmate {{gave him a}} handcuff key. The inmate was handcuffed by one wrist to another inmate, but he was able to, without any prison employee noticing, remove the cuffs and free himself. [...] The inmate was able to cling to the undercarriage of a prisoner transport bus to ride away from the facility. <b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> the bus in the South Bronx and walked away, but was apprehended nearly a month later. Six officers and a captain were given administrative leave due to the incident. The corrections commissioner said the escape {{was caused by a}} combination of the inmate's quick thinking and the officers' sloppy work.|$|E
2500|$|On February 28, 1914, Jack Pferdner, {{captain of}} the steamer Agnes, was serving on Nestor while Agnes was {{temporarily}} out of service. [...] Nestor was towing logs. [...] Near Prescott about 3 miles upriver from Rainier, some logs broke loose. [...] Pferdner walked out on the log tow to secure the loose logs. [...] This was called “dogging”. [...] The log Pferdner was walking on rolled, and he was thrown head-first into the river. [...] Pferdner came up and tried to grab on to the log, but it kept rolling, {{and he could not}} get a grip. [...] Capt James Peck, in charge of Nestor, yelled at Pferdner to {{get to the end of}} the log, but by this time, Pferdner was too exhausted to comply. [...] <b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> the log and sank under the water, and was not seen again. [...] Grappling hooks were used to search, all afternoon, for Pferdner’s body, but the only thing that was found was the hatchet that Pferdner had been holding when he was thrown into the water.|$|E

5000|$|Gambit / Remy LeBeau (Chris Potter (1992-96), Tony Daniels (1997)): He {{can charge}} {{virtually}} any object with explosive energy, {{turning them into}} bombs; they only explode once <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> the object. <b>He</b> also wields a staff for close combat, and for when he's out of playing cards to throw.|$|R
60|$|The cowboy {{stepped down}} slowly, guardedly, {{but he kept}} on. Allie saw men {{run out of the}} crowded dance-hall into the open space behind Stanton.

Allie pressed the cowboy's arm to warn him, and <b>he,</b> <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> her, {{appeared}} to motion her behind him.|$|R
2500|$|Finally his {{financial}} advisors {{realized he was}} tens of millions in debt, and could not pay the interest on the loans, let alone reduce the principal. [...] The proposed bond sale failed to attract investors, as Hearst's financial crisis became widely known. His latest movies flopped for Marion Davies had lost her star status. As the crisis deepened, <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> most of his household staff, sold his exotic animals to the Los Angeles Zoo, and named a trustee to control his finances. He still refused to sell his beloved newspapers. The trustee cut Hearst's annual salary to $500,000, and stopped the annual payment of $700,000 in dividends. He had to pay rent for living in his castle at San Simeon. [...] Legally it was not bankruptcy, although the general public generally saw it that way as appraisers went through the tapestries, paintings, furniture, silver, pottery, buildings, autographs, jewelry, and other collectibles. His collections were sold off {{in a series of}} auctions and private sales in 1938–39. John D. Rockefeller, Junior, bought $100,000 of antique silver for his new museum at Colonial Williamsburg.|$|E

5000|$|The BBC {{also gives}} the film three stars but warns, [...] "Jovy is so keen on {{giving us a}} {{snapshot}} of club culture (which comes across as startlingly real) that <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> his well-wounded plot and so the mid-section becomes a long flat stretch, punctured only by a few entertaining bits and bobs." ...|$|R
500|$|The plot of [...] "War and Pieces" [...] {{references}} {{the film}} Jumanji. Some {{of the board}} games referenced include Chutes and Ladders and Mouse Trap. Milhouse's death, where <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> a ledge and sinks into water, is a reference to Jack Dawson's death in Titanic. The answer for the hangman game Bart and Milhouse played is Wheel of Fortune.|$|R
