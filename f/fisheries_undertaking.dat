40|$|This {{research}} {{sought to}} assesss the safeguards protecting scientific objectivity in New Zealand deep-water fisheries science decision-making fora. Managing depleted, slow-growing and poorly-understood stocks demands particularly accurate, objective scientific information. New Zealand's Ministry of <b>Fisheries</b> <b>undertakes</b> deep-water <b>fisheries</b> management in an nformation-poor, high-stakes context. This context means {{neither of the}} two strictly separate policy and scientific advice processes is able, in isolation, to provide advice confidently. Preliminary investigations suggested that to enable the Ministry to meet the ongoing need for management of deep-water fishing, science fora are effectively taking on a quasi-policy role. This research investigated whether deep-water fisheries science processes have sufficient safeguards to protect the objectivity of scientific decision-making in this difficult climate, thereby ensuring maximum accuracy in their advice. Twentytwo personal {{interviews were conducted with}} key informants, and analysed using grounded theory. Themes thus revealed were analysed in light of concepts from economics, philosophy of science and institutional analysis literature. Research suggested that the scientific process is ill-suited for handling non-scientific judgements, and the spread of non-scientific considerations into scientific fora is risking the objectivity of scientific analysis which is critical for fisheries management. Imbalanced stakeholder representation in scientific fora further imperils objectivity in these fora, with potentially significant implications for sustainable fisheries management...|$|R

40|$|Economic {{surveys of}} <b>fisheries</b> are <b>undertaken</b> in several {{countries}} {{as a means of}} assessing the economic performance of their fisheries. The level of economic profits accruing in the fishery can be estimated from the average economic profits of the boats surveyed. Economic profits consist of two componentsÂ—resource rent and intra-marginal rent. From a fisheries management perspective, the key indicator of performance is the level of resource rent being generated in the fishery. Consequently, these different components need to be separated out. In this paper, a means of separating out the rent components is identified for a heterogeneous fishery. This is applied to the multi-purpose fleet operating in the English Channel. The paper demonstrates that failing to separate out these two components may result in a misrepresentation of the economic performance of the fishery. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|Small-scale fishers (SSFs) {{are among}} the most {{vulnerable}} socio-economic groups because of their high dependence on marine resource harvesting. While small-scale fisheries employ {{the overwhelming majority of the}} world's fishers and contribute substantially to the global catch, they are, on the whole, marginalised and ignored. Despite their importance in providing food security and livelihoods in coastal communities, state management authorities routinely neglect small-scale fisheries in favour of industrial fisheries. In South Africa, the exclusion of small-scale fishers is intricately linked with the oppressive policies of the apartheid government, which limited access to the fisheries for the largely Black and Coloured smallscale fishers. Changes within fisheries management practices led to the development of management tools that moved away from conventional resource-centred strategies, to management approaches that recognised the complexity of natural and ecological processes inherent within small-scale fisheries. Many of these new approaches have been embraced in South Africa's new small-scale fisheries policy. The policy represents a long line of arguably failed attempts at reforming South African <b>fisheries</b> <b>undertaken</b> by the South African government. While the policy is unique in the scale of participation by the small-scale fishers themselves it is still faced with the hurdle of implementation. The adoption of the individual rights approach embodied by the individual quota (IQ) system in the post-apartheid reforms has led to divisions within the community. Fishing rights benefited a small elite and disenfranchised many more fishers for whom fishing was a livelihood, but were excluded from the rights allocations. The new small-scale fisheries policy is widely acknowledged as progressive and carries the hope of inclusion for small-scale fishers along South Africa's coasts. After decades of disenfranchisement and individual rights allocations, the major challenge in the new policy's implementation will be dealing with the range of complex and unique communities in which the policy will be carried out. The purpose of this study was to establish a profile of the Lamberts Bay small-scale fisher groups and their perceptions regarding the new small-scale fisher policy, in order to inform the policy's implementation in Lamberts Bay...|$|R
50|$|Although Yemen's {{extensive}} {{territorial waters}} and marine resources {{have the potential}} to produce 840,000 tons of fish each year, the fishing industry is relatively underdeveloped and consists largely of individual fishermen in small boats. In recent years, the government has lifted restrictions on fish exports, and production has reached one-quarter of capacity, yielding revenues valued at US$260 million in 2005. Fish and fish products constitute only 1.7 percent of Yemen's GDP but are the second largest export. In December 2005, the World Bank approved a US$25 million credit for a Fisheries Management and Conservation Project to be launched in all coastal governorates along the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

40|$|Dynamic {{adjustment}} {{is an integral}} part of natural resource economics. Commonly, capital is assumed to respond instantaneously to changes in profits, while in reality adjustment may take place only with a time lag. In this paper, an empirical analysis of capital (boat) dynamics in the North Sea herring <b>fishery</b> is <b>undertaken.</b> A discrete time model is formulated to model decisions of boats to enter or exit the fishery. A lagged model is specified to reflect adjustment time to changes in profits. The empirical results indicate that fleet adjustment in this fishery primarily depends on current period profits and that the opportunity cost may depend on returns in the alternative fishery. Inclusion of lagged variables to account for the construction time for new boats, showed only a small improvement in the statistical fit. Moreover, the results did not support a hypothesis that entry in response to positive profits is more elastic than exit due to negative profits.

As with fisheries management in most countries, multiple management objectives were implicit in policy statements, but were poorly specified in some areas (particularly social objectives) and strongly identified in others (e. g., an objective of sustainability). As a start to the management review process, an analysis of what objectives the management system should aim to achieve was undertaken. A review of natural resource management objectives employed internationally was used to develop a candidate list, and the objectives most relevant to the fishery were short-listed by a scientific advisory group. Additional objectives specific to Queensland fisheries management, but not identified in the international review, were also identified and incorporated into the objective set.

At least 35 species of fish and invertebrates were caught, with hake dominating the catches in terms of both weight and number.

No illegal sized hake (under 27 cm total length) were caught in either gear during the study period. Discards of non-commercial species were similar for both gears and considered to be negligible (< 3 % by weight). Hake discards were significantly different between gears (7 % for long-lines and 42 % for gill nets, by weight), due to fish deterioration related to soaking time.
