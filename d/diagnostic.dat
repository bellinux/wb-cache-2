Sets of <b>diagnostic</b> criteria were outlined by Gillberg and Gillberg in 1989 and by Szatmari et al. in the same year. AS became a standard diagnosis in 1992, when it was included in the tenth edition of the World Health Organization's <b>diagnostic</b> manual, International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10); in 1994, it was added to the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's <b>diagnostic</b> reference, <b>Diagnostic</b> and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} diagnosis is usually made based on recovery of poliovirus from a stool sample or a swab of the pharynx. Antibodies to poliovirus can be <b>diagnostic,</b> and are generally {{detected in the}} blood of infected patients early in the course of infection. Analysis of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is collected by a lumbar puncture ("spinal tap"), reveals an increased number of white blood cells (primarily lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein level. Detection of virus in the CSF is <b>diagnostic</b> of paralytic polio, but rarely occurs.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Even though {{several studies}} on the {{treatment}} of the diabetic foot have been conducted, little is known about performance of the <b>diagnostics</b> in the period before treatment. The recently revised guidelines state that proper <b>diagnostics</b> are essential for optimal treatment. Aim {{of this study is to}} gain insight in the extent with which <b>diagnostics</b> are performed in accordance with the guidelines. Methods: <b>Diagnostics</b> performed in patients with diabetes mellitus who underwent an lower-extremity amputation in the period 2007 - 2011 were retrospectively examined. ‘Complete diagnostics’ were determined based on the guidelines. Distinction was made between non-invasive and invasive <b>diagnostics</b> focused on chronic ischaemia and <b>diagnostics</b> focused on infection. Performed <b>diagnostics</b> were compared with <b>diagnostics</b> according to the guidelines. Results: The study group included 122 lower-extremity amputations. Non-invasive <b>diagnostics</b> were complete in 66 % of the cases, invasive <b>diagnostics</b> in 49 %. The largest loss was seen in lack of visualisation of the distal arteries. <b>Diagnostics</b> focused on infection were complete in 27 % of the cases. In the group ‘combination of chronic ischaemia and infection’ more <b>diagnostics</b> focused on ischaemia were performed than in patients with chronic ischaemia alone (e. g. angiography with visualisation of distal arteries: 52 % vs 30 %), but significant less <b>diagnostics</b> focused on infection were performed than in patients with infection alone (e. g. wound culture: 55 % vs 93 %, p= 0. 007). Conclusion: <b>Diagnostics</b> is often not performed in accordance with the international guidelines. The largest loss is seen in lack of visualisation of the distal arteries. When a combination of chronic ischaemia and infection is present, more <b>diagnostics</b> are performed focused on ischaemia, whereas less <b>diagnostics</b> are performed focused on infection. Improving implementation and compliance to protocols based on the guidelines is recommended. ...|$|R

5|$|D-dimers are a fibrin {{degradation}} product, and {{an elevated}} level {{can result from}} plasmin dissolving a clot—or other conditions. Hospitalized patients often have elevated levels for multiple reasons. When individuals are at a high-probability of having DVT, <b>diagnostic</b> imaging is preferred to a D-dimer test. For those with a low or moderate probability of DVT, a D-dimer level might be obtained, which excludes a diagnosis if results are normal. An elevated level requires further investigation with <b>diagnostic</b> imaging to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|Wireless vehicle <b>diagnostics</b> is {{expected}} to provide great improvements {{to the maintenance of}} future cars. By using certificates, vehicles can identify <b>diagnostics</b> equipment for a <b>diagnostics</b> session, even over long distances. However, since the <b>diagnostics</b> equipment contains authentication keys used to authenticate such sessions, it is critical that neither the keys nor the equipment is lost. Such a loss can give unauthorised access to any vehicle accepting these keys until the theft is detected and the certificates are revoked. In this paper, we propose a method to protect vehicles against unauthorised <b>diagnostics</b> sessions. A trusted third party is introduced to authorise sessions, thus we do not rely solely on proper identification and authentication of <b>diagnostics</b> equipment. Our approach enables vehicles to verify the validity of <b>diagnostics</b> requests. It is transparent to the <b>diagnostics</b> protocol being used, supports different levels of trust, and can control what commands are permitted during <b>diagnostics</b> sessions...|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the classification of seizures which focuses on what happens during a seizure, the classification of epilepsies focuses on the underlying causes. When a person is admitted to hospital after an epileptic seizure the <b>diagnostic</b> workup results preferably in the seizure itself being classified (e.g. tonic-clonic) and in the underlying disease being identified (e.g. hippocampal sclerosis). The name of the diagnosis finally made depends on the available <b>diagnostic</b> results and the applied definitions and classifications (of seizures and epilepsies) and its respective terminology.|$|E
