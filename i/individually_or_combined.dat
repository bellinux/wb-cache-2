The specific protein phosphatases regulating apoptosis {{have been more}} elusive. Using double-stranded RNA-mediated interference (RNAi), the role of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A) in cellular signaling was investigated. Knockdown of A <b>or</b> C subunits <b>individually</b> <b>or</b> of <b>combined</b> B subunits led to concurrent loss of nontargeted PP 2 A subunits, suggesting that PP 2 A is an obligate heterotrimer in vivo. Global knockdown of PP 2 A activity or specific loss of redundant B 56 regulatory subunits caused cell death with the morphological and biochemical changes characteristic of apoptosis in cultured S 2 cells. B 56 :PP 2 A-regulated apoptosis required caspases and the upstream regulators dark, reaper, head involution defective, and dp 53. In Drosophila embryos, knockdown of B 56 -regulated PP 2 A activity resulted in apoptosis and failure of gastrulation, an effect that was blocked by concurrent RNAi of the caspase Drice.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the production and properties of hybrid materials based on poly(lactic acid) (PLA), employing microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and organophilic silica (R 972) as fillers. The composites were obtained by solution casting to form films. Each nanoparticle was incorporated at 3 wt. %, relative to the polymer matrix. In this experiment, four films were obtained (PLA, PLA/MCC, PLA/R 972 and PLA/MCC/R 972).

The results showed that each nanoparticle, added <b>individually</b> <b>or</b> both <b>combined,</b> had different effect on the final properties of the films. Microcrystalline cellulose can act as nucleating agent for the crystallization of PLA. Silica promoted an increase in rigidity, due to the strong intermolecular forces, while MCC addition promoted an increase in the molecular mobility of the polymeric chains. The PLA/MCC/R 972 film showed the highest crystallinity degree and tensile modulus. This film presented a T 1 H value between both values found for PLA/MCC and PLA/R 972 films.

Results: Thirty-eight articles with data on individual symptoms and signs and 15 articles with data on prediction rules met all inclusion criteria. In children with sore throat, the presence of a scarlatiniform rash (likelihood ratio [LR], 3. 91; 95 % CI, 2. 00 - 7. 62), palatal petechiae (LR, 2. 69; CI, 1. 92 - 3. 77), pharyngeal exudates (LR, 1. 85; CI, 1. 58 - 2. 16), vomiting (LR, 1. 79; CI, 1. 58 - 2. 16), and tender cervical nodes (LR, 1. 72; CI, 1. 54 - 1. 93) were moderately useful in identifying those with streptococcal pharyngitis. Nevertheless, no individual symptoms or signs were effective in ruling in or ruling out streptococcal pharyngitis.
