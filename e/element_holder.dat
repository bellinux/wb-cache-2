40|$|The thesis {{presents}} the results of numerical analyses that are part of a study on suitability of a new method of window installation in the façade system Qbiss One, produced by the company Trimo d. d. The main novelties of the new system are the removal of the longitudinal reinforcement pipes and a modified design of the window and façade <b>element</b> <b>holder.</b> In numerical analyses we discussed the part of the façade system which we named the panel-window-panel system. For its plot the CATIA programme was used and for the analysis according to the method of finite elements, we used the programme ANSYS where we took into account the symmetry of the system under consideration. All the details of Qbiss One panels and the windows have been modelled and for that we used 3 d finite elements for solid body and shell finite elements. Both types of finite elements were linked together with contact finite elements. We made linear elastic analyses {{of the effects of the}} wind and temperature changes, the stationary thermal analysis, modal analysis and buckling analysis, as well as geometrical and material nonlinear analysis, both for the effect of wind. Based on the calculated results we obtained information on the acceptability of the proposed new method of window installation in the façade system Qbiss One. It turns out that with some additions, the new method could become a perfectly acceptable replacement of the existing window installation method...|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} manipulation of biological cells is very attractive now in biotechnology (Butler, 1991)) because it opens {{the possibility of}} examining and manipulating single molecules. Other methods are based on chemical effects, electrical effects, etc., and they generally do not allow researchers to examine single molecules cell and, thus, to understand their interaction which may encode many useful pieces of information. Such {{physical manipulation}} is fully performed by robotic devices. In order to automate the process of physical manipulation, micro machine vision for the fast identification of the objects involved is required. Typical objects that are involved are cells, cell <b>elements,</b> <b>holders</b> and injectors. In the research described in this thesis, which {{was carried out in}} the Advanced Engineering Design Laboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Saskatchewan, algorithms for the three objects (the cell, holder and injector) were developed, implemented and tested. The results obtained have shown that the fastest identification times for these three objects are respectively 0. 12 s for the cell oocyte, 6. 78 s/ 100 frames for the holder, and 6. 72 s/ 100 frames for the injector. These performances are acceptable {{in the context of the}} physical manipulation of biological cells. The goal of the research described in this thesis was to develop algorithms that would give a fast recognition of the cell manipulation system. With the aid of the algorithms, an automatic operation of the cell manipulation system would be achieved. Image process and pattern recognition techniques were used in developing the Visual C++&# 63720; GUI algorithms that would automatically recognize the components of the cell manipulation system for the purpose of manipulating the cells...|$|R

For seven decades, fluorosulfonic acid HSO3F and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid CF3SO3H were the strongest known acids that could be {{isolated}} as single compounds. Both are about a thousand times more acidic than pure sulfuric acid. In 2004, a boron compound broke this record by a thousand fold with the synthesis of carborane acid H(CHB11Cl11). Another metalloid, antimony, features in the strongest known acid, a mixture 10 billion times stronger than carborane acid. This is fluoroantimonic acid H2FSbF6, a mixture of antimony pentafluoride SbF5 and hydrofluoric acid HF.|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedSophisticated {{language}} processing {{in recent years}} has made it possible to take on increasingly complex text analysis challenges. One such challenge is recognizing, classifying, and understanding opinionated text. This ability is desirable for various tasks, including filtering advertisements, separating the arguments in online debate or discussions, and ranking web documents cited as authorities on contentious topics.; However, discussion and analysis of opinionated text is very difficult due to a general inability to define what exactly an opinion is. In this work, we introduce a methodology for defining and analyzing opinions. We decompose the task of opinion analysis into four parts: 1) recognizing the opinions; 2) identifying their valence; 3) identifying their holder and topic; and 4) identifying their reason. For more detailed analysis, we define two kinds of opinions: 1) Judgment opinions about the world, with emotive values such as good, bad, neutral, wise, foolish, virtuous, etc; and 2) Belief opinions (specifically, about the future, which we call Predictive opinions), with epistemic values such as likely, unlikely, possible, uncertain, etc.; In this study, we introduce a method for detecting Judgment opinions using a technique that leverages a small set of seed words and a WordNet expansion algorithm. We propose an algorithm for Predictive opinions, as a subclass of Belief opinions, using a feature generalization technique. This algorithm sets the foundation for exploring a whole new category of opinion detection for Belief opinions in general. For opinion holder and topic identification, we develop two methods. The first method utilizes syntactic features of an opinion, holder, and topic in a sentence, while the second method applies semantic frames of opinion words as an intermediate step of opinion holder and topic identification. We also introduce a model of opinion reason identification. We first present a novel technique that automatically labels a large corpus for this task, and then investigate our approach using lexical, structural, and semantic features.; The main contribution of this work is to introduce a framework to analyze opinions at a deeper level with core semantic <b>elements,</b> valence, <b>holder,</b> topic, and reason, and to use this framework for a real world application. We develop algorithms and resources and apply them across several opinion domains, including news media texts, product reviews, consumer complaints, citizens' emails, and political discussions...|$|R
40|$|Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) {{is a part}} of an {{international}} network organization called Hizb al-Tahrir (HT). The organization is commonly portrayed as an "anti-system" movement that seeks to overthrow democracy and revives the past transnational rule of the khilafah (caliphate). This view is justified by the doctrine of HT that promotes a revolutionary strategy of non-participation and envisages a political change outside the parliamentary process of democracy. Based on this ideology, many see the future of HT in its role of radicalizing Muslims that eventually lead to violence. This study evaluates the consistency of HTI in following its revolutionary strategy of non-participation. It argues that HTI is undertaking a strategic shift from a total non-participation to a selective participation. It establishes a strategic balance between revolution and reform by taking part in the democratic system for stirring opposition toward the existing political system. HTI focuses on challenging the legitimacy of democracy {{while at the same time}} engages with the supporting institutions and actors of the democratic system. This strategy resembles the model of political change called by Oxford University's political scientist, Timothy Garton Ash, "refolution. " It aims to overthrow the existing political system without overthrowing the political regime. It seeks entry into the system to covert key <b>elements</b> of power <b>holders</b> and to persuade them to undertake a fundamental change from democracy to an Islamic government based on shari'ah law. This change is inevitable for HTI to adjust itself to the democratic context of Indonesia that integrates the majority of Muslims in the democratic system. This presence of Muslim actors in the system has created a perception of political opportunity for Islamization that prevents HTI from confronting the existing political process. This stance betrays HTI's revolutionary doctrine that requires it to uncompromisingly undermine the legitimacy of the democratic system and propagate political detachment. However, HTI understands that opposition to the Muslim involvement in the democratic process can isolate it from its most potential allies. Based on this, this study calls attention to the trajectory of HT outside the box of violent and revolutionary activism. The above path is especially likely for HT that operates in the context of Muslim democracies. HTI offers an alternative strategy to violent activism and the moderate trend of Islamist movements. Evidence shows HTI is building support bases for the establishment of a pro-shari'ah or anti-system politics, either in the form of starting a new party or in creating a coalition between the existing parties. To support this argument, this study analyzes the nature of HTI's activities and its attitude toward the democratic structure. It is primarily based on a content analysis of HTI's discourse and activities recorded in two of its main publications: Al-Islam weekly bulletin and Al-Wa'ie monthly magazine. These sources cover HTI's activism from 2000 to 2009. Methodologically, it follows references and activities relating to key elements of Indonesian democracy (such as state ideology, democracy, election, the government, House of Representative, and political parties) and elements of Muslim society that are part of the democratic system. Drawing on the theories of political change, the analysis is based on the scope of change and the degree of opposition it promotes. Cases are analysed on a scale of 1 to 3 that represents moderate, radical and extreme. The finding shows mixed attitudes with a significant portion of radical character. This confirms the character of "refolutionary" strategy: it focuses on challenging political system over political institutions and combines political participation with anti-democratic campaign...|$|R
