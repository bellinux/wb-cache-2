40|$|The idea of {{a common}} <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> {{heritage}} is frequently {{referred to in the}} political discourses and practices of the EU. The {{idea of a}} <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage elevates the ideas of ownership and inheritance beyond the local, regional, or national frameworks and transforms the heritage sites and objects into a ‘common good’ belonging to all Europeans and into a source of a common <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> identity. Scholars have debated the possibility of a common <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage, and in case such could exist, what it could be grounded upon. Critical scholars have asked what might be the trans-border European dimension of heritage that goes beyond the mere sum of national, regional, or local icons, or questioned the possibility of common European heritage practices {{due to the lack of}} a singular European people. Some scholars have, however, found a possible common ground for a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage for example in urbanity, European cities and their historical environment, and the styles and movements of art and architecture. Functions and uses of the idea of <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage and the contexts in which it becomes important and meaningful have changed over the course of time and are constantly transforming. The recent societal, political, and cultural changes in Europe have influenced the notions on heritage and made the concept of a common <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage more problematic. What is a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage and how has it been approached in recent scholarly discussions? How can a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage be made sense of in relation to the ideas of universalism, cosmopolitanism, particularism, transnationalism, translocalism, transculturalism, and pan-Europeanism?

Theories of ‘good design’ in artefact design literature do not unilaterally apply to the design for an augmented reality device.

40|$|The vague {{concept of}} a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> {{heritage}} is frequently referred to – but rarely explicitly defined – in scholarly discussion. The use of the concept in academia constructs a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage as a category in research and explicitly and implicitly produces its focuses and outlines.
