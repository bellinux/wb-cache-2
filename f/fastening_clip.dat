25|$|After new {{segments}} of rail are laid, or defective rails replaced (welded-in), the rails can be artificially stressed if {{the temperature of}} the rail during laying is cooler than what is desired. The stressing process involves either heating the rails, causing them to expand, or stretching the rails with hydraulic equipment. They are then <b>fastened</b> (<b>clipped)</b> to the sleepers in their expanded form. This process ensures that the rail will not expand much further in subsequent hot weather. In cold weather the rails try to contract, but because they are firmly fastened, cannot do so. In effect, stressed rails are a bit like a piece of stretched elastic firmly fastened down.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{the rail}} {{fastening}} systems {{play an important}} role for preserving the connection between the rails and sleepers in various conditions. In this paper, stress based concept is used to develop a comprehensive approach for fatigue reliability analysisof <b>fastening</b> spring <b>clip.</b> Axle load, speed and material properties are assumed to be random variables. First, track and train models are analyzed dynamically in order to achieve displacement time history of fas-tening spring clip. Then this displacement time history is applied to the <b>fastening</b> spring <b>clip</b> in FE software to obtain variable ampli-tude of stresses. Crack nucleation life is calculated by rain-flow method and Palmgren-Miner linear damage rule. First Order Relia-bility Method (FORM) and Monte-Carlosimulation technique are employed for the reliability index estimations. The influences of various random variables on the probability of failure are investi-gated by sensitivity analysis. The results show that the equivalent stress range and material parameter have significant effect on fa-tigue crack nucleation...|$|R
5000|$|For dual-gauge {{track to}} be {{achievable}} using three rails, {{the difference between}} the gauges needs to be at least as wide as the foot of the rail, otherwise {{there is no room for}} the rail <b>fastening</b> hardware (spikes, <b>clips,</b> and the like). The following pairs of gauges can be dual-gauged without problem: standard gauge (...) and , [...] and , and [...] and [...] Standard gauge (...) and [...] can also be dual-gauged, albeit with lighter, narrow-footed rails, as done in Victoria, Australia.|$|R
50|$|An oriental rug is woven by {{hand on a}} loom, with warps, wefts, and pile made {{mainly of}} natural fibers like wool, cotton, and silk. In {{representative}} carpets, metal threads made of gold or silver are woven in. The pile consists of hand-spun or machine-spun strings of yarn, which are knotted into the warp and weft foundation. Usually the pile threads are dyed with various natural or synthetic dyes. Once the weaving has finished, the rug is further processed by <b>fastening</b> its borders, <b>clipping</b> the pile to obtain an even surface, and washing, which may use added chemical solutions to modify the colours.|$|R

The Garter is a buckled dark-blue (originally light-blue) velvet strap, and bears the motto in gold letters. The garters of Stranger Knights and Ladies were once set with several jewels. Two styles have been used: one is a working garter where the end slips through the buckle and then is tucked in a specific way and the other style is a 'pre-made' one that has the buckled and tucked end pre-fashioned and is <b>fastened</b> with a <b>clip</b> attachment.|$|R
5000|$|Patients {{are placed}} under a general anesthetic, and a {{catheter}} containing the MitraClip is {{inserted into the}} femoral vein. Fluoroscopy (X-ray imaging) helps the surgeon to guide the device through the venous system to the heart. Once at the heart, echocardiography (ultrasound imaging) is used to position the device at the mitral valve. The device enters the heart through the inferior vena cava to the right atrium. The surgeon will pass the catheter through the septal wall between the two atria, allowing the device to pass to the left atrium. This is a very precise puncture that requires both the echocardiography and fluoroscopy images to locate the proper area. The MitraClip passes through the annulus into the left ventricle and sits below the leaflets. Once on the ventricular side of the mitral valve, the MitraClip is opened and pulled towards the atria. The open MitraClip grabs both mitral valve leaflets, the surgeon closes the clip, and the leaflets are <b>clipped</b> together. <b>Fastening</b> the <b>clip</b> to the leaflets decreases regurgitant blood. [...] The use of both echocardiography and fluoroscopy is necessary to perform the implantation of MitraClip. However, this requires the surgeon to mentally fuse the images from these two separate methods. The use of new technology called the EchoNavigator software can merge the images from echocardiography and fluoroscopy. This software aims to reduce procedure time and increase success in MitraClip procedures. The integration of both imaging techniques is especially valuable during the puncture of the atrial septum and while grasping the leaflets and fastening the MitraClip. These are the two steps that are dependent on the surgeon having precise placement in the heart, and the EchoNavigator helps with this placement. In cases where multiple MitraClips are necessary to decrease the mitral regurgitation, the use of EchoNavigator can substantially reduce the procedure time.|$|R
40|$|Gradient-echo echo-planar imaging, GRE-EPI, is {{the most}} used imaging {{technique}} in functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI, based on the blood oxygenation level-dependent, BOLD, effect. BOLD fMRI exploits susceptibility differences between oxygenated and deoxygenated blood to detect neuronal activation. However, the sequence parameters which make GRE-EPI sensitive to the BOLD effect also make it sensitive to susceptibility artifacts such as geometric distortions and signal loss. Susceptibility gradients near air/tissue interfaces can severely compromise the detection power of the BOLD analysis in {{certain areas of the}} brain, especially in the orbitofrontal cortex and temporal lobes. The objective of this project was to develop methods that could detect areas in the brain particularly sensitive to signal loss and geometric distortions and areas where the detection power of the BOLD analysis had been compromised as a result of susceptibility differences in the brain. The effect of susceptibility induced magnetic field inhomogenities on the image quality and on the BOLD sensitivity was investigated. Magnetic field maps were generated and used as a guide to detect areas at risk for artifacts. The field maps were also used to generate simulations of the image intensity and BOLD sensitivity. BOLD fMRI has, since its inception, been a valuable part of brain research. The methods developed in this project were tested on data collected from the FRONT project. FRONT conducted BOLD fMRI analysis on patients with a known damage to the frontal lobe and on healthy controls. Magnetic field maps and simulated BOLD sensitivity maps were generated for a sample of the subjects. BOLD fMRI has become an increasingly valuable tool for use in presurgical planning. Data from an epilepsy patient was collected. The BOLD analysis was conducted for the purpose of locating important centers, such as the language centre, in preparation of epilepsy focus resection. The patient had several metallic <b>clips</b> <b>fastened</b> in the scull, from previous operations, susceptibility differences from the clips, in addition to differences close to air/tissue interfaces, made the detection of BOLD signal challenging. Simulated BOLD sensitivity maps were generated to help in the presurgical planning. It was found that the BOLD sensitivity maps together image distortion maps, generated from the magnetic field maps, are useful tools for identifying problem areas in in BOLD fMRI...|$|R
