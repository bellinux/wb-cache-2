40|$|A {{literature}} review {{was conducted to}} determine the type, extent and severity of corrosion found in the 10 - and 14 -ton mild steel depleted UF{sub 6 } storage cylinders. Also discussed in this review is corrosion found in the valves and plugs used in the cylinders. Corrosion of the cylinders is a gradual process which occurs slowly over time. Understanding corrosion of the cylinders is an important concern for long term storage of the UF{sub 6 } in the cylinder yards, {{as well as the}} final disposition of the depleted UF{sub 6 } tails inventory in the future. The following conclusions are made from the {{literature review}}: (1) The <b>general</b> external <b>corrosion</b> rate of the cylinders is about 1 to 2 mils per year (1 mil = 0. 001 {double_prime}). The highest <b>general</b> external <b>corrosion</b> rate was over 5 mpy on the 48 G type cylinders. (2) <b>General</b> internal <b>corrosion</b> from the depleted UF{sub 6 } is negligible under normal storage conditions. Crevice corrosion can occur at the cylinder/saddle interface from the retention of water in this area. Crevice corrosion can occur at the cylinder/skirt interface on the older skirted cylinders {{due to the lack of}} water drainage in this area. Crevice corrosion can occur on cylinders that have been in ground contact. Crevice corrosion and galvanic corrosion can occur where the stainless steel I. D. nameplates are attached to the cylinder. The packing nuts on the bronze one-inch valves used in the cylinders are susceptible to stress corrosion cracking (SCC).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Corrosion {{of steel}} cables and {{reinforcing}} steel in concrete structures {{is a major}} cause of structural deterioration. The current methods for corrosion detection suffer from several significant drawbacks. In this paper, a nondestructive evaluation technique is developed that is capable of determining the location and severity of corrosion of embedded or encased steel rebar and cables. This technique utilizes time domain reflectometry (TDR), which has been traditionally used to detect electrical discontinuities in transmission lines. By installing a sensor wire along side steel reinforcement, the reinforcement can be modeled as an asymmetric, twin-conductor transmission line. Physical defects of the reinforcement, such as abrupt pitting <b>corrosion,</b> <b>general</b> surface <b>corrosion,</b> and grouting voids, will change the electromagnetic properties of the line. They can be modeled analytically, and identified using TDR. TDR measurement results from several fabricated bridge cable sections with built-in defects are reported. Based on the initial results, the TDR corrosion detection method has proven to be more robust than the existing methods because it allows one to detect, locate and identify the extent of corrosion damage...|$|R
