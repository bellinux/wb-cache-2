The primary {{task of the}} EVA was to replace HST's High Speed Photometer (HSP) with the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) system which would correct HST's spherical {{aberration}} of the main mirror for all instruments except the WFPC2 camera, which had its own built-in corrective optics. Akers received a go {{for the opening of}} HST's -V2 aft shroud doors at 10:45 pm EST. The doors were scheduled to be opened during a night pass to minimize thermal changes and reduce the possibility of out-gassing of components that could contaminate the optics. [...] The High Speed Photometer (HSP) was powered down at 10:54 pm EST and the door opening started at 10:57 EST. Shortly after partially opening the door, the astronauts practiced reclosing the door. The door exhibited the same reluctance upon closing that was experienced on different doors during previous EVAs. The doors were fully opened by 11:00 pm EST and four power and data connectors plus one <b>ground</b> <b>strap</b> were disconnected from the HSP. The HSP was removed at 11:27 pm EST and then reinserted to practice for the COSTAR installation. HSP was then parked {{on the side of the}} payload bay while COSTAR was removed from stowage and successfully installed in the HST by about 12:35 am EST. The astronauts closed the HST equipment bay doors and stowed the HSP. At 2:25 am EST they started upgrading HST's onboard computer by bolting on an electronics package containing additional computer memory and a co-processor. The computer system was then reactivated and passed its functionality tests at 4:41 am EST. The EVA was 100% successful and lasted for 6 h 50 min.|$|E

40|$|Currents and {{voltages}} injected and induced on {{high speed}} high populated printed circuit boards (PCBs) due to an electrostatic discharge (ESD) may produce damages and failures on fast logic devices. Thus, ESD generators are widely used for testing the robustness of electronic equipments which must comply with immunity standards [1 - 2]. In order to ensure a reproducibility of test results, the contact discharge mode is usually preferred to the air discharge one, since {{the influence of the}} arc on the discharge current is avoided. Anyway, a correct study of the susceptibility of a system claims an accurate simulation of the generator and the <b>ground</b> <b>strap</b> whose current distribution must be predicted to reproduce the fields which couple with the victim. The numerical simulation of ESD generators represents a tricky issue on which much work has been published [1 - 5]. Recently it has been suggested [4] a simplified model which allows to simulate the main features of an ESD generator with reasonable accuracy and computational effort, avoiding the necessity of a fully detailed model which makes use of time dependent materials [1]. Although some details are not correctly modelled, e. g. the electrostatic field due to the charging of the generator and the highest frequency content of the fields due to the pulse forming structure which is not included in the model, the magnetic radiated field is simulated with good accuracy as well as the time trend of the electric field, which only differs by an offset constant value [4]...|$|E
40|$|Department of Electrical EngineeringAs {{the high}} {{performance}} very-large-scale integration (VLSI) systems operate with high speed and low voltage, the system-level electrostatic discharge (ESD) event is {{becoming one of}} the important noise sources causing logic errors and system malfunctions such as system reboot or fault. To understand the ESD noise phenomena and improve the system-level ESD noise immunity for devices, the accurate ESD noise measurement and analysis of IC logic errors are necessary. Section I is written for the tendency of ESD research and previous research. This paper presents the noise type correlation by measuring the signal-ground noise and power-ground noise simultaneously on the fundamental F/F operation circuit and shows the type of error from chip, in section II. Furthermore, the decoupling capacitors (de-cap) effect that can reduce the error occurrence by checking the error rate are analyzed. A generator is designed on the main board which is based on real operating laptop, and the chip on dual in-line memory module (DIMM) is also designed to perform the basic F/F operation. The clock and data input from generator are connected to the chip on the DIMM through the small outline dual in-line memory module (SODIMM) socket. ESD occurs {{at the corner of the}} ground plane of main board. The specification of the ESD generator satisfies IEC 61000 - 4 - 2 [1]. The ESD current flows along the <b>ground</b> <b>strap,</b> and affects the DIMM. IN-ground, CLK-ground, OUT-ground and power-ground on the DIMM are simultaneously measured to determine the effect of ESD on the main board. To analyze the error ratio according to the ESD voltage level, the voltage setup of the ESD gun is 3 kV, 5 kV and 8 kV. To investigate the effects of chip shielding and DIMM de-caps on the error probability of DIMM, the experiment is conducted under the several conditions. After confirming the normal operation for each condition, the error type on the DIMM due to the ESD occurred in the circuit is analyzed and the statistics are shown. The results are verified by H-spice simulation, Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) and HFSS simulation. In order to obtain the improvement method of the DIMM immunity, experiments are conducted to find out the effective position and number of DIMM de-cap. Accurate measurements of electromagnetic fields are also essential to analyze the radiated noise due to unwanted electrostatic discharge (ESD) events at electronic devices. Usually, to know the radiated noise by ESD events, the voltages induced at field probes are measured, and the fields are obtained from the voltage by de-convolving the probe factor. In section Ⅲ, the two probe-factor deconvolution methods are investigated and compared in the measurements of the fields induced by system-level ESD events. clos...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In {{high voltage}} power cable system, partial {{discharge}} (PD) {{is a common}} phenomenon which reflects the degradation of insulation.

The system mainly consists of PD sensor, pre-amplifier, front-end sample device and remote server center. The front-end device is the kernel part of the system, as it performs PD signals sampling and some essential digital signal processing such as noise filtering, pulse extraction and parameters statistics. Then, the derived characteristic parameters are sent to the remote server center by ethernet communication for further analysis.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{presented}} in two parts. Part 1 deals primarily with Bi-based materials and a small amount of work on a Y-based composition while Part 2 covers work on Tl-based materials. In Part 1, a reliable and reproducible process for producing bulk bismuth-based superconductors has been developed. It is noted however, that a percentage of the tapecast material experiences curling and fracturing after a 30 hour sintering period and is thus in need of further examination. The Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O (BSCCO) material has been characterized by critical temperature data, X-ray diffraction data, and surface morphology. In the case of T sub c, it is not critical to anneal the material. It appears that the BSCCO material has the possibility of producing a better <b>grounding</b> <b>strap</b> than that of the 123 material. Attempts to reproduce near room temperature superconductors in the Y-Ba-Cu-O system were unsuccessful. In Part 2, several methods of processing the high temperature superconductor Tl 2 Ba 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 were investigated; i. e., different precursor compositions were sintered at various sintering times and temperatures. The highest superconductig temperature was found to be 117. 8 K when fired at 900 C for three hours. Higher sintering temperatures produced a melted sample which was nonsuperconducting at liquid nitrogen temperature. Also, a preliminary study found Li 2 O substitutions for copper appeared to increase the transition temperature and create fluxing action upon sintering.

The measurements were obtained by dynamic SIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry) using a VG Isolab 54 ion microprobe. Plots of O- 18 /O- 16 against time, show large depletions of up to a factor of 2 compared to the O- 18 /O- 16 value at sea level. The O- 16 current decreases by 2 orders of magnitude in the interior of the metal, and the corresponding profile of anomalous O- 16 is strongly peaked in the outer few tens of nanometers of the surface. This depth scale is a tentative one based on estimated sputtering rates. Plots of O- 18 /O- 16 against 1 /O- 16 should be linear if two isotopically distinct components, one of variable concentration (orbital component) and one of fixed concentration (normal oxygen), are mixed. Data to be presented at the meeting show departures from linearity which result from variability in the concentration of normal oxygen, but may also arise from the implantation of oxygen with a range of fractionation due to the decaying orbit of the LDEF, sputtering of the surface by atomic oxygen, and the different momenta of the two isotopes due to their equal velocities. The potential for using this method as a means of identifying exposure to low-Earth orbit, de-convoluting the effects of space exposure from terrestrial contamination, and using the implanted anomolous oxygen as a means of studying the atomic oxygen density and upper atmosphere temperature height profile will be discussed at the meeting...|$|R
