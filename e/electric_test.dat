30|$|A {{system with}} higher {{photocurrent}} response is greatly preferred for potential applications. As well as {{looking for new}} materials or systems with specific band structure and band gap, a proper treatment on a system would be also suitable methods to enhance photoresponse. Our experimental results support that the intrinsic electric conductance would be a critical factor to optimize the photocurrent response. This might be achieved through appropriate growth conditions. As shown in Fig.  4, the photocurrent is 2 orders enhanced through conductance adjustment. This study could guide other researchers into constructing a suitable guideline in selecting a better system for further experimental studies through a simple <b>electric</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E
40|$|Assembly and {{alignment}} of nanomaterials, such as nanowires or nanotubes, are critical steps for integrating functional nanodevices by the bottom-up strategy.

With the electrode array pre-defined, the density, position and width of the nanowire arrays on the electrode array can be readily tuned by adjusting the flow duration and flow rates of the sheath flow and the sample flow in the asymmetrical hydrodynamic focusing process. Not only is an easy way to implement <b>electric</b> <b>test</b> on nanowires, this approach also has great potential in mass integration and assembly of large arrays of functional nanodevices...|$|E

40|$|The {{reaction}} {{concept is}} employed to formulate an integral equation for radiation and scattering from plates, corner reflectors, and dielectric-coated conducting cylinders. The surface-current density on the conducting surface is expanded with subsectional bases. The dielectric layer is modeled with polarization currents radiating in free space. Maxwell's equation and the boundary conditions are employed {{to express the}} polarization-current distribution {{in terms of the}} surface-current density on the conducting surface. By enforcing reaction tests with an array of <b>electric</b> <b>test</b> sources, the moment method is employed to reduce the integral equation to a matrix equation. Inversion of the matrix equation yields the current distribution, and the scattered field is then obtained by integrating the current distribution. The theory, computer program and numerical results are presented for radiation and scattering from plates, corner reflectors, and dielectric-coated conducting cylinders...|$|E
