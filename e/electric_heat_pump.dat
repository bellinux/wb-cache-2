50|$|Energy {{efficiencies}} {{of water}} heaters in residential use can vary greatly, particularly depending on manufacturer and model. However, electric heaters {{tend to be}} slightly more efficient (not counting power station losses) with recovery efficiency (how efficiently energy transfers to the water) reaching about 98%. Gas fired heaters have maximum recovery efficiencies of only about 82-94% (the remaining heat is lost with the flue gasses). Overall energy factors can be as low as 80% for electric and 50% for gas systems. Natural gas and propane tank water heaters with energy factors of 62% or greater, as well as electric tank water heaters with energy factors of 93% or greater, are considered high-efficiency units. Energy Star-qualified natural gas and propane tank water heaters (as of September 2010) have energy factors of 67% or higher, which is usually achieved using an intermittent pilot together with an automatic flue damper, baffle blowers, or power venting. Direct electric resistance tank water heaters {{are not included in}} the Energy Star program, however, the Energy Star program does include <b>electric</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> units with energy factors of 200% or higher. Tankless gas water heaters (as of 2015) must have an energy factor of 90% or higher for Energy Star qualification. Since electricity production in thermal plants has efficiency levels ranging from only 15% to slightly over 55% (combined cycle gas turbine), with around 40% typical for thermal power stations, direct resistance electric water heating may be the least energy efficient option. However, use of a heat pump can make electric water heaters much more energy efficient and lead to a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions, even more so if a low carbon source of electricity is used.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{residential}} sector {{is responsible for}} more than 35 % of the final energy consumption in the European Union, and is increasingly constrained by thermal regulations, resulting in a significant rise of new efficient heating technologies. This paper presents {{a comparison of the}} energetic and environmental performances of six heating systems installed in a low energy house: a gas-fired condensing boiler, a wood pellet boiler, a micro-combined heat and power (MCHP), an air-to-water <b>electric</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump,</b> an air-to-water gas absorption heat pump and an exhaust air-to-air <b>electric</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump.</b> The comparison is made with respect to the annual primary energy consumption and the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and carried out under various climates and electricity generation mixes. The results indicate that, based on an ideal sizing, the MCHP and the absorption heat pump achieve the highest energy performances. However, both technologies suffer from small size unavailability, leading to significant oversizing which impacts their performances. Based on current size availability, the air-to-water <b>electric</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> benefits from the previous systems oversizing and thus appears as the most efficient technology. However, current sizing practice also causes significant oversizing which impacts the performances of thermodynamic systems. Without significant sizing practice improvements, the air-to-water <b>electric</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> merit decreases in favor of the MCHP.
