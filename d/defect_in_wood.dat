30|$|In {{terms of}} accuracy, {{the use of}} {{attenuation}} by spectral analysis significantly increased the accuracy in detecting small <b>defect</b> <b>in</b> <b>wood.</b> The TOF showed 5.925 of RMSE but spectral analysis showed much lower error of prediction (1.858 of RMSE). When wave speed and spectrum were used together as independent variables (M 2 in Table  3), the RMSE decreased to 1.840. In addition, 2 nd derivative pretreatment lowers the RMSE up to 1.609. This error of prediction was much lower than conventional parameters (Table  2). This comparison demonstrated that the attenuation spectral analysis would be worth in internal defect detection in NDT inspection of cultural heritage building.|$|E
30|$|Several {{methods for}} {{nondestructive}} detection of termite attacks {{have been investigated}} and developed. They are classified into two categories: detection of termite activity in the wooden constructions and evaluation of mass loss of wooden objects. An example of the former is acoustic emission (AE) monitoring, which utilizes the detection of small elastic waves called acoustic emissions (AEs), generated by the feeding activity of worker termites in wood [1 – 4]. Technology to detect reflection of micro or millimeter waves from termite movement in the wood has also been developed and applied [5, 6]. One of the latest methods is the detection of inner cavities by measuring the velocity or attenuation of the sound or elastic wave propagating in wood. A scanning radar apparatus at 1.4  GHz, which detects {{the reflection of the}} wave radiated onto the wood, was applied for the nondestructive detection of an inner <b>defect</b> <b>in</b> <b>wood</b> such as a cavity [7].|$|E

40|$|Wood is {{a natural}} {{polymeric}} material which has a heterogenic nature.

30|$|In the through-transmission {{ultrasonic}} technique, the detectability can {{be governed}} by algorithm to analyze the received signal. The algorithm could analyze the wave speed (1 /TOF) and/or the attenuation of wave during passing through the wood. The wave speed (TOF) is being used frequently because of its simplicity and sensitivity to defects. But the attenuation is barely used <b>in</b> detecting internal <b>defects</b> because of its complexity in analysis and inconsistency in measurement. Even though the attenuation analysis is not simple, the analysis of attenuation {{has been used in}} non-wood materials [8, 9]. <b>In</b> <b>wood,</b> Tallavo et al.

30|$|This {{study was}} {{intended}} to detect nondestructively some defects such as knots and grain deviations <b>in</b> <b>wood</b> using modal analysis.

The results are summarized as follows: (1) The shapes of flexural vibration waves at the first mode of wooden beams free of defects coincided almost completely with the theoretical wave shape. (2) The shapes of flexural vibration waves of wooden beams containing defects such as knots clearly differed from the theoretical wave shape, especially near the defect.

30|$|Wood {{is widely}} used in {{industrial}} products such as furniture and structural members. The constant use of <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> industry, however, has been sometimes disturbed by the fluctuation of physical properties <b>in</b> <b>wood</b> because this fluctuation may cause <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> the <b>wood</b> products. For example, the abrupt change of wood density causes the structural defects such as raised and loosened grains. Thus, the physical properties should be evaluated nondestructively to control {{the quality of the}} wood products [1].|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{sensitivity}} of TOF, recently more advanced techniques have been developed. When applying the through-transmission method, there are some limitations because its two transducers should contact the wood of inspection. Therefore, Hasenstab et al. [3] developed ultrasonic-echo system to detect <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> <b>wood.</b> It could detect and visualize cracks and knots <b>in</b> <b>wood.</b> Besides, the ultrasonic methods for wood generally require that the transducers are pressed with a well-controlled force onto the inspected sample. To remove this limitation, Sanabria [4] developed air-coupled ultrasonic system for detecting bonding failure in glulam. Because transducers do not need contact to wood, the effect of couplant on the receiving signal was reduced. In different point of view, the ultrasonic technique has been improved by combining computed tomography (CT) algorithm. Several researches on ultrasonic CT have been performed [5 – 7]. The CT reconstruction provides higher detectability than two transducer system and provides the information about location of the defects.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{address the issue of}} {{detecting}} <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> <b>wood</b> using features extracted from grayscale images. The feature set proposed here is based on the concept of texture and it is computed from the co-occurrence matrices. The features provide measures of properties such as smoothness, coarseness, and regularity. Comparative experiments using a color image based feature set extracted from percentile histograms are carried to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed feature set. Two different learning paradigms, neural networks and support vector machines, and a feature selection algorithm based on multiobjective genetic algorithms were considered in our experiments. The experimental results show that after feature selection, the grayscale image based feature set achieves very competitive performance for the problem of wood defect detection relative to the color image based features.

40|$|Abstract. An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} Korean pine specimen by ultrasonic tester. The effect of hole size and holes amount in axial direction of wood {{as well as the}} distribution of end holes on ultrasonic wave velocity were respectively studied. A comparison test was carried out between the specimens of one hole defect and no defect with different lengths. Then regression analysis of the relation between hole size and ultrasonic wave velocity was done using SPSS software. The experimental results show that the length of wood components has significant effect on ultrasonic wave velocity. The ultrasonic wave velocity has negative correlation with hole size and holes amount. End hole has no significant effect on ultrasonic wave velocity.

30|$|In wooden {{cultural}} heritage building, insect damage, such as termite damage, {{is one of}} the most serious problems. Because the insect damage can occur inside of wooden member, it is difficult to recognize the damage. Besides, the termite prefers early wood rather than latewood, because it is softer and easier to eat than latewood, as a result the insects make narrow and long tunnels in a longitudinal direction of <b>wood</b> member. <b>In</b> viewpoint of structural safety, the area of damage in a cross section is information of interest. In a cross section, the early stage of the damage is very small because the early wood is less than 5  mm in width. Based on the sensitivity of TOF on <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> <b>wood,</b> TOF-based CT was developed and this CT could detect larger than 13  mm diameter defects [5].

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of flash thermography for the examination and conservation of works of art: paintings, works on paper and sculpture. Thermography is a non-destructive technique for the identification of subsurface <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> materials. It {{is based on the}} propagation of surface-deposited heat through into the material. Differences <b>in</b> propagation between <b>defect</b> and defectfree areas result in a difference in the surface temperature of the material. The surface temperature is mapped over time by imaging with a mid-infrared digital camera. A xenon arc lamp is used to provide the initial source of radiation, and signal processing is typically applied to the collected data to reduce noise and to enhance key signal characteristics. This technique offers the possibility of investigating the structure of paintings and paper, particularly in cases where other non-destructive examination techniques do not provide sufficient information, for example subsurface delamination and layer structure. The results indicate that thermography is a good technique for detection of paint delamination and the degree of adhesion between layers, particularly in canvas paintings.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} FeaSANNT, an evolutionary algorithm for optimisation of artificial neural networks, to the training of a multi-layer perceptron for identification of <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> <b>wood</b> veneer. Given a fixed artificial neural network structure, FeaSANNT concurrently evolves the input feature vector and the network weights. The novelty of the method lies {{in the implementation of}} the embedded approach in an evolutionary feature selection paradigm. Experimental tests show that the proposed algorithm produces high-performing solutions with robust learning results. Significant reduction of the set of veneer features is obtained. Experimental comparisons are made with a previous method based on statistical filtering of the input features and a standard genetic wrapper algorithm. In the first case, FeaSANNT greatly reduces the feature set with no degradation of the neural network accuracy. Moreover, FeaSANNT entails lower design costs since feature selection is fully automated. In the second case, the proposed algorithm achieves superior results in terms of identification accuracy and reduction of the feature set. FeaSANNT involves also lower computational costs than the standard evolutionary wrapper approach and eases the algorithm design effort. Limited overlapping is observed between the patterns of features selected by the three algorithms. This result suggests that the full feature set contains mainly redundant attributes...|$|R

The aim of this work was {{to evaluate the use}} of sunset laser to qualify mechanically processed surfaces with similar visual qualities. We used a log from the base of a Khaya ivorensis tree and one from a K. senegalensis tree, both 11 years old. 22 specimens of dimensions 600 x 140 x 30 mm (CxLxE) were made of each species.

Also, the elastic wave technique provides valuable information on the internal state of wood. Also, the time of flight (TOF) is sensitive to the <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> <b>wood</b> [3]; based on this knowledge, TOF-based computed tomography (CT) was developed and commercialized for standing tree inspection (FAKOPP 3 D Acoustic tomography, Fakopp, Hungary; PICUS Sonic tomography, argus electronic gmbh, Germany). The CT technology reconstructs cross section views by the filtered back projection (FBP) algorithm and TOF of waves passing through various paths in the cross section. This CT technique can provide higher detectability by inspection of more wave paths [4]. Nevertheless, this technology cannot detect early stage of insect damage because of its size. Kim et al.

The forestry industry and researchers in New Zealand are concentrated on finding an efficacious, economic, and environmentally sound method of preventing blue stain in P. radiata and other tree species. New Zealand relies on the exportation of wood and wood products, therefore {{it is not only}} crucial that blue stain is prevented to minimize the amount of downgraded wood products but also that the quarantine risk associated with blue stain fungi to export destinations is recognized. In order to address these concerns, a concentrated attempt to identify species of blue stain fungi present in New Zealand was undertaken starting in 1996 and lasting about 10 years. From this research, 13 known species of ophiostomatoid fungi and several unidentified species were isolated from various wood sources. Several were associated with the introduced bark beetles Hylastes after and Hylurgus ligniperda. The role of these beetles in vectoring fungi to logs was previously known, but recent research identified a role for H. after as a vector of these fungi to P. radiata seedlings during feeding attempts.

Future wood products will come from intensively managed silvicultural regimes — eucalypt regrowth forest and plantations. Solid-wood regimes involving high-cost operations such as pruning and thinning will be economically sensitive to downgrade due to various types of stem defect — fungal and insect damage, staining, kino veins. In Tasmania, research over the last decade has focused on developing management strategies to minimise stem defect caused by decay fungi in both regrowth and plantation eucalypts. Under plantation conditions neither Eucalyptus nitens (Deane & Maiden) Maiden nor E. globulus Labill. shed branches efficiently. Retention of dead branches leads to <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> <b>wood</b> such as a large knotty core or loose knots, making the stem unsuitable for either veneer or sawlog. Pruning of green branches at canopy closure and in subsequent lifts shortly afterwards solves this problem. However, on the more productive warm and wet sites there is a high level of decay infections in E. nitens and E. globulus via pruning wounds. We are investigating the complex pathological, physiological, genetic, and silvicultural components dictating eucalypt susceptibility to decay infection and its long-term spread into clearwood including: crown characteristics prior to pruning; growth responses to pruning; growth responses to fertiliser; host resistance and antimicrobial defences; and the identity and pathogenicity of decay fungi.
