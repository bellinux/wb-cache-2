First, the fuel cell model developed in Labview along with controller model and co-simulated with the inverter model in Multisim. Then the simulated model compared with the hardware implemented model using the same inverting concept with the same driver, filter and load. The comparison between simulation output and hardware- in loop result is monitored in the Labview for accuracy and case studies. FC-based power generation systems are expected to become a clean and reliable sources of future distributed generation (DG) applications. Two types of fuel cells -proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) - are perfect candidates for DG applications. In this project SOFC is used as a high efficiency dc source. The SOFC model implemented in Labview based on defined assumptions and criteria and it consists of an electrochemical and a thermodynamic submodels. The responses are studied under constant and variant fuel flow rate of operation and steady state temperature mode. This model has a good potential to be used in any real-time applications. The NI compactRIO DC/AC <b>inverter</b> <b>board</b> consists of two, three-phase two-level Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) inverters, two single phase rectifier bridges, reconfigurable controller, and appropriate interconnections between components. The board can incorporate both analog and digital inputs with appropriate interfaces. The analog plant circuitry of the NI board???s inverter implemented in Multisim. The controller, a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), is modeled in LabVIEW based on a three stage flowchart of closed loop continuous time (i. e. rise time, steady state error and maximum overshoot), floating point (discretized) and fixed point digital controller implementation. The power electronic circuits in Multisim and mathematical models of fuel cell and FPGA controller in labVIEW co-simulated in labVIEW providing a potential for validating, analyzing and troubleshooting large power plants by running real-time computer simulations. This new approach development tool saves so much time and cost at a high accuracy and efficiency. Once the design is done, the SOFC source can be replaced easily by any other distributed generators like photovoltaic panel and the power system can be used in other applications such as vehicular applications...|$|E

The inverter {{should be able to}} supply an electrical machine with 48 V and 250 A. Initial calculations and simulations were made to get some base for the ordering of hardware. The <b>inverter</b> <b>board</b> consists of six MOSFETs in parallel for each phase and the PCB itself is made of aluminum to enable a thermal substrate technique. The inverter PCBs are mounted on an aluminum frame where liquid runs between them to cool the inverter. The drive circuit is controlled with a dSPACE system and the tests are made with a load consisting of cables and iron powder cores. Temperatures are measured with PT 100 sensors for the water and an infrared camera for the surfaces. Two different MOSFETs were investigated, one with higher switching losses and one with higher conduction losses. The two inverters were tested on an RL load and the cooling system picked up around 270 W at a phase current of 150 Arms. Theoretical calculations, performed with measured parameters, represents the temperature measurements well. The thermal resistance between the case and the sink in the inverter, Rcs, is measured to around 0 : 15 [K=W]...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this study, {{we aim to}} {{demonstrate}} a microgrid system experimental simulation for an easy understanding of a large-scale microgrid system. This model is required for industrial training and learning environments. However, {{in order to create}} an exact representation of a microgrid system, the laboratory-scale system must fulfill the requirements of a grid-connected inverter, in which power values are assigned to the system to cope with the intermittent output from renewable energy sources. Aside from that, during fluctuations in load capacity, the grid-connected system must be able to supply power from the utility grid side and microgrid side in a balanced manner. Therefore, droop control is installed in the <b>inverter’s</b> control <b>board</b> to maintain a balanced power sharing in both sides. This power control in a stand-alone condition and droop control in a grid-connected condition must be implemented in order to maintain a stabilized system. Based on the experimental results, power control and droop control can both be applied in the system by comparing the experimental and reference values.

40|$|The {{drive to}} develop {{electric}} machines {{with a wide}} constant power-speed range (CPSR), high torque capabilities, excellent efficiency, superior reliability, and a reduced environmental footprint for EV traction and ship propulsion systems has led to research interest in various Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM). One particular area of interest is multi-phase fault tolerant PMSM drive systems, which are integral {{to the development of}} electric traction systems with all-inclusive motors that include sensors, inverter modules, and a cooling system, much like an automobile engine. Furthermore, these designs simplify fault condition maintenance because their independent single-phase structure allows them to be used with replaceable modular inverter units which have one H-bridge for each phase. In order to provide high reliability for the PMSM drive systems, even in a fault condition, simple but effective current control methods are necessary. An interior PMSM configuration with 5 independent phases is presented for electric vehicle (EV) traction and ship propulsion applications along with the proposed design procedure as well as an associated inverter design and current control methods. The proposed design process is verified using finite element analysis (FEA). An existing 5 -phase 15 -slot 4 -pole Interior PMSM was modified to remove the neutral point, thus allowing for independent control of the 5 phases with 5 H-bridge inverters through a fabricated custom-made control board. Bipolar and unipolar switching methods were evaluated and an effective switching method was proposed to drive the motor. Closed loop speed control was implemented using Step VSI control, SPWM control, and hysteresis control methods. Finally, the 5 -phase 10 -lead PMSM systems were evaluated under the various control methods using simulated and experimental data after fabricating a new <b>inverter</b> interface <b>board</b> with TI floating point DSP, Delfino (F 28335). The results suggest that multi-phase fault tolerant PMSM drive systems could {{play a key role in}} the future of EV traction and ship propulsion systems.

40|$|The results {{obtained}} in the simulations and the actual results that are observed on the SPIM drive for the DSFCC strategy are in agreement. The operations of the control strategies during the extreme conditions were tested such as the trip of the one inverter. It was observed that the PI regulators are able to regulate the currents in both the control schemes, however in the DCC strategy the controllers cannot control the huge imbalance between the two inverters and the system trips same is true if the DC link voltage falls too much. For the DSFCC strategy the SPIM drive operation is still possible even if one inverter is failed during the operation, this is possible in case if the SPIM is loaded below the rated and the inverter has sufficient overcurrent capacity. The two control strategies {{are more or less}} gives equal performance in the steady state but in the transient state there are more z axis currents are induced in the DSFCC strategy than the DCC strategy as the DCC employs the Z axis regulator. From the results it can be concluded that both control strategies can be complementary to each other for example in case of the failure of the one <b>inverter</b> on <b>board</b> the DSFCC control strategy can be used {{for the start of the}} machine with one inverter.

40|$|Rms voltage {{regulation}} {{may be an}} attractive possibility for controlling power inverters. Combined with a Hall Effect sensor for current control, it keeps its parallel operation capability while increasing its noise immunity, which {{may lead to a}} reduction of the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). Besides, as {{voltage regulation}} is designed in DC, a simple PI regulator can provide accurate voltage tracking. Nevertheless, this approach does not lack drawbacks. Its narrow voltage bandwidth makes transients last longer and it increases the voltage THD when feeding non-linear loads, such as rectifying stages. On the other hand, the implementation can fall into offset voltage error. Furthermore, the information of the output voltage phase is hidden for the control as well, making the synchronization of a 3 -phase setup not trivial. This paper explains the concept, design and implementation of the whole control scheme, in an on <b>board</b> <b>inverter</b> able to run in parallel and within a 3 -phase setup. Special attention is paid to solve the problems foreseen at implementation level: a third analog loop accounts for the offset level is added and a digital algorithm guarantees 3 -phase voltage synchronization...|$|R
40|$|The PhD project aims {{to develop}} a smart {{grid-connected}} inverter (SGCI) for a micro-grid, which can be applied in a built environment such as a community, and associated power electronic DC/DC converters. The micro-grid generally includes distributed renewable power generators and battery storage. The SGCI is a bi-directional DC/AC inverter for distributed generation with battery storage installed at its DC side. In one aspect, it is expected the DC/AC inverter functions as a controlled inverter that can deliver expected real power to the power grid with quantitative reactive power compensation (RPC). In other words, all the SGCIs in the community microgrid can share the reactive power of the whole community because a SGCI can quantify its active and reactive power output. It is also expected that the inverter can work in both on-grid and off-grid modes. In other words, the DC/AC inverter functions as a controlled rectifier with high quality power factor correction (PFC), which can deliver expected DC power from the AC power grid at unity power factor. With the above features, battery storage on the DC bus of the SGCI can be charged/discharged through a four-phase, interleaved, bi-directional, boost/buck DC/DC converter (IBDBBC) for distributed renewable power system, either wind or solar PV or hybrid wind/solar PV system. The IBDBBC can discharge power from a low voltage battery to a high voltage DC bus as the IBDBBC operates in boost mode, or it can also draw power from the DC bus {{to charge the battery}} as the IBDBBC operates in buck mode. Based on MATLAB/Simulink, a mathematical model was developed for the grid-connected bi-directional DC/AC inverter that operates as a rectifier with PFC and as a grid-connected inverter (GCI) with expected real power output and quantitative RPC. In a practical application, the sampling of input signal through AD converter usually has some noise due to common-mode interference; simulation results demonstrate that the second order generalised integrator (SOGI) has great advantages to prevent interference. Therefore, SOGI can be utilised to construct a pair of orthogonal signals in a single-phase system to instantaneously split grid’s active and reactive power to achieve RPC for local community loads. The methodology of the constructed the pair of orthogonal signals was also used to generate the required reference current for the DC/AC inverter when which operated as a single-phase rectifier with PFC. Using three TI C 2000 Solar <b>Inverter</b> DSK <b>Boards,</b> a small lab scale distributed power system was developed. In the lab distributed power system, the operating mode of the inverters could be switched between on-grid and off-grid through instruction from the control centre.
