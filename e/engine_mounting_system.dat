40|$|The vehicle <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> <b>system,</b> which {{consists}} of several mounts connecting the engine to the vehicle structure, not only supports {{the weight of the}} engine but also isolates the noise, vibration and the transmitted forces to the vehicle structure. At present conventional elastomeric mounts are widely used in engine mounting systems for commercial vehicles. However, these mounts cannot fulfill the conflicting characteristic requirements for the best isolation concerning both road and engine induced vibrations. Therefore, to improve the noise and vibration isolation of commercial vehicles it is necessary to go beyond traditional passive isolators and use semi-active or active vibration control systems due to their capabilities of addressing the conflicting requirements in different road and engine conditions. The aim of the research presented in this thesis is to first develop mathematical and computational models of elastomeric engine mounts for heavy trucks and investigate the nonlinear behavior of dynamic stiffness and damping of the mounts, and finally use the developed models to design and analyze an adaptronic <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> Adaptronic <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> is referred to a mounting system where actuators, sensors and controller are optimally incorporated in the conventional elastomeric mounting system. The developed computational model of the engine mounts is implemented in Matlab/ Simulink and used in a 3 D engine model with which vibration dynamics analysis under different engine and realistic road inputs is conducted. Moreover, the possibility and advantages of using active engine mounts have been studied by incorporating actuators into the above mentioned 3 D engine model with conventional mounting system for heavy trucks. Simulations of the engine vibration dynamics under similar engine and road excitations have been done for the adaptronic mounting system and compared to the results from the conventional <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> The results of simulations of engine vibration dynamics and transmitted forces to the vehicle structure have shown good potential for vibration isolation improvement in heavy trucks by using adaptronic engine mounting systems...|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{properties}} of engine mount influence {{the performance of}} the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> The frequency-dependent properties represented the more accurate properties of the engine mount as opposed to the frequency-independent properties model. Impact technique in the past has been used to measure the dynamic driving point stiffness in the axial position which omitted the shear properties. In this research, the impact technique is extended to measure the global {{dynamic properties}} including the dynamic shear stiffness of the engine mount [...] When the engine mount is oriented in certain angles, the combination effect of dynamic compression stiffness and dynamic shear stiffness altered the global dynamic properties of the engine mount. A transformation technique is developed to include both of the dynamic stiffnesses and used them to determine the global dynamic properties of engine mount. Three different types of engine mounts are used to validate the application of the developed technique. Finally, optimization was carried out to demonstrate the effect of the global dynamic properties based on the frequency-dependent properties of engine mount. The optimum locations and orientation angles of each individual mount are identified to minimize the mean force transmissibility of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> The reduction of the force transmissibility showed that optimization based on the frequency-independent properties underestimated the peak transmissibility...|$|E

Even though the current engine mount designs are acceptable for vibration isolation of the transmitted forces from engine to chassis, the performance improvement of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> is still required for the tendency of light weight and higher power of the vehicle. In this thesis, a coupled three degree-of-freedom engine mount system with both elastomeric and hydraulic mounts, are developed. The system performance is evaluated through simulation {{with the purpose of}} isolating the vibrations in entire frequency range and under engine excitation force. The engine dynamic model is established based on the analysis of the kinematics and dynamics of its components and gas variation. The unbalanced inertia force caused by engine reciprocating and rotating parts is derived as the vertical excitation force. The net torque, generated by the inertia forces and gas pressure, is formulated using geometrical relationship of the engine components.

40|$|Structure-borne noise within vehicle {{structures}} {{is often}} transmitted in a multi-dimensional manner {{and thus the}} vibro-acoustic model(s) of automotive powertrain or chassis must incorporate longitudinal and transverse (flexural) motions {{as well as their}} couplings.

The powertrain source is however assumed to be rigid, and both harmonic force and moment excitations are considered. Our analysis is limited to a linear time-invariant system, and the frequency domain based mobility method is utilized to synthesize the overall system. Contributions of both in-plane and flexural motions to structure-borne and radiated noise are incorporated. Two examples are considered to illustrate the methodology. First, multi-dimensional transmissibility and effectiveness terms are analytically and comparatively evaluated along with vibration power-based measures for an inverted 'L' beam receiver and selected source configurations. Further, free field sound pressures are calculated and correlated with structure-borne power transmitted to the receiver. Second, sound measurements and predictions for an experimental inverted 'L ' plate receiver demonstrate that a rank order based on free field sound pressures may be regarded as a measure of structure-borne noise reduction. Measured insertion losses for sound pressure match well with those computed...|$|E
