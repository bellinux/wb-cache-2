40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to examine issues relevant to best practices for preschooler mental health prevention policy so as to inform future prevention policy. Data were gathered through the examination of two preschool prevention programs, Ontario Early Years Centres (OEYCs) and <b>Healthy</b> <b>Babies,</b> <b>Healthy</b> Children (HBHC). These prevention programs were examined with respect to four major issues: (a) the ideology and origins of the program, (b) theoretical underpinnings, (c) research base, and (d) implementation and adaptation issues. To explore these four issues, qualitative methods were used in the form of document reviews (two documents for the Early Years Centres and two documents for the <b>Healthy</b> <b>Babies,</b> <b>Healthy</b> Children) and key informant interviews (seven informants for the Early Years Centres and six informants for <b>Healthy</b> <b>Babies,</b> <b>Healthy</b> Children). The main finding regarding the ideology and origins of the Early Years Centres and <b>Healthy</b> <b>Babies,</b> <b>Healthy</b> Children is that a mixture of values related to both personal well-being and collective well-being was used in the framing of both the problem(s) and solution(s). Furthermore, informants indicated that centres were created by the government in response to both timing (an influx of federal funding for programs for preschool children) and the influences of key people. A key finding regarding the theoretical underpinnings of both programs is that brain-based development theories were used to explain how the quality of early sensory stimulation during critical early periods influences the brain’s ability to develop properly. The centres were used improve the quality of stimulation for preschool children by assisting parents and children through the use of centre-based programs, whereas <b>Healthy</b> <b>Babies,</b> <b>Healthy</b> Children programs used primarily family-based programs. Findings for the research base were based on evaluations conducted on both programs. While the evaluation reports suggest encouraging conclusions regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of both programs, the methodologies used in the evaluations of both programs have major limitations. As for best practices with regard to the Early Years Centres and <b>Healthy</b> <b>Babies,</b> <b>Healthy</b> Children, key informants noted the lack of comprehensiveness, accessibility, follow-up assessments, and theoretical basis of the programs and the issues of insufficient dosage of the interventions. Cultural sensitivity was deemed by informants to be a strong aspect of both programs. Key informants also noted that centres are struggling to provide consistent programming across Ontario. Additionally, the <b>Healthy</b> <b>Babies,</b> <b>Healthy</b> Children program’s home visitation services lack intensity and may not be effective because this program uses lay home visitors in its primary approach to home visitation. Findings regarding implementation and adaptation for the centres include a clear message from informants that the ease of implementation was dependent on whether the centre began in a pre-established organization. Additionally, key informants asserted that the extent of community ownership and adaptation varied from centre-to-centre across Ontario. The implementation and adaptation issues faced by <b>Healthy</b> <b>Babies,</b> <b>Healthy</b> Children are evidenced in the lack of pilot projects the program undertook before it was implemented province-wide. This approach led to implementation that was not based in teachings from research evidence or community-based knowledge. While informants commended HBHC’s ability to adapt to the community’s needs, the community’s sense of ownership of the program is still questionable. The findings of this research have implications for improving preschool mental health prevention policy in all four categories. These implications include: (a) more thorough framing of the problem(s) and solution(s), (b) {{a deeper understanding of the}} research base upon which the greatest program impacts can be achieved, and (c) the need for pilot projects before province-wide implementation...|$|R

Wang explains this means [...] "with a certain possibility, that her fetus {{has a kind of}} genetic problem.

[...] Dr. Diana Bianchi of Tufts disputes the possibility of the test being used for such a diagnosis. She says, [...] "The test involves looking at genetic sequences on the X chromosome and the Y chromosome. If he gave a diagnosis of Trisomy 18, that involves a different chromosome, Chromosome 18. That is certainly something that is not advertised in the packaging associated with the test. [...] "It is possible that, upon being told of a problem by Acu-Gen, a woman may seek to have an amniocentesis or other invasive procedure which may be an unnecessary risk if the Acu-Gen diagnosis was in error.

40|$|Systolic {{pulmonary}} {{arterial pressure}} was determined serially {{over the first}} 10 days of life in 33 babies with hyaline membrane disease by measuring the peak velocity of pansystolic tricuspid valve regurgitation, using Doppler ultrasound, and applying the Bernoulli equation. Results are presented in age groups 0 - 12, 13 - 36, 37 - 72, and 73 - 96 hours respectively. The incidence of tricuspid valve regurgitation was 92, 97, 80, and 64 % (falling to 35 % by day 10) compared with 53, 50, 31, and 0 % in 17 healthy premature infants. In comparing <b>healthy</b> <b>babies</b> with those with hyaline membrane disease, no allowance was made for right atrial pressure. The derived 'right ventricle to right atrial (RV-RA) pressure difference', was expressed as a ratio of systemic arterial (systolic) pressure. Over the first three days, this ratio fell much faster in the <b>healthy</b> <b>babies.</b> Values were 0. 78 : 1, 0. 77 : 1, and 0. 72 : 1 in babies with hyaline membrane disease and 0. 87 : 1, 0. 53 : 1, and 0. 44 : 1 in <b>healthy</b> <b>babies.</b> Ductal patency was prolonged in babies with hyaline membrane disease (75 % on day 4 compared with 6 % in <b>healthy</b> <b>babies).</b> The incidence of bidirectional ductal flow, indicating balanced pulmonary and systemic arterial pressures, was 79, 53, 30, and 20 %, and in <b>healthy</b> <b>babies</b> was 41 % at 0 - 12 hours and zero thereafter. Pulmonary arterial pressure was then calculated by adding a right atrial pressure estimate of 5 mm Hg to the RV-RA difference when the babies were ventilated. Babies of lower gestation had lower values. The pulmonary: systemic arterial pressure ratio showed considerable temporal variability, but fell with age and was raised by high mean airway pressure and pneumothorax (through a reduction in systemic pressure), and less noticeably by carbon dioxide tension. It did not correlate significantly with other indices of disease severity. Hyaline membrane disease is associated with delayed postnatal circulatory adaptation characterized by pulmonary hypertension, systemic hypotension, and prolonged ductal patency...|$|R
