60|$|COMTESSE. It {{is quite}} true, Charles. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> so; and indeed he {{repeated}} {{what he called}} the 'peroration' before me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come back, McGovery, and don't be a fool. Father Cullen's gone to Dromod. I think <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> Tom Ginty wanted him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He went {{straight}} up on deck," [...] said Steve slowly, [...] "walked aft, {{and then down}} into the cabin. The skipper woke up, and <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>’im</b> <b>say</b> something to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|I took {{leave of}} Prawle {{and half a}} crown. Before I was off the quay <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>saying</b> to a lady, [...] "Bane in collision, marm! Like to zee over her?" ...|$|R
60|$|Hate. My lord, this Atheism {{is one of}} the vilest wretches {{that ever}} I came near, or had to do with in my life. <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> that there is no God; <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> that there is no world to come, no sin, nor {{punishment}} hereafter, and, moreover, <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> that it was as good to go to a whore-house as to go to hear a sermon.|$|R
60|$|Har. Jun. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> {{he never}} had returned, but that his masters of the East India company {{preferred}} him large conditions.|$|E
6000|$|I clasped {{my hands}} and hid my face in despair. Oh, the {{bitterness}} of heart with which <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> those simple words! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'She will wait,' <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say.</b> 'Eyes {{like hers}} never deceive. But I shall see her again. Traitors cannot keep an O'Connor down forever.' ...|$|E
60|$|Although we {{had been}} {{members of the same}} club for years, I only knew Mr. Spugg by sight until one {{afternoon}} when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>saying</b> that he intended to send his chauffeur to the war.|$|R
6000|$|The missionary {{immediately}} {{took him}} by the hand, and as he led <b>him</b> away <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "me most glad to find you trader; we t'ought you be pirate. You very like one 'bout the masts." ...|$|R
60|$|Hate. My lord, <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say,</b> that peace, {{though in}} a way of unrighteousness, is better than trouble with truth.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{said it is}} {{a strange}} case {{and that he will}} watch it closely. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> to the nurse to watch Tom very closely." ...|$|E
60|$|Lau. Nay, mamma, you shouldn't {{be against}} my lieutenant, for <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> {{you were the}} best natured and best looking woman in the world.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had moved}} close behind Lane, and fancied <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> softly to himself: [...] "I'll fix you so you'll be sorry for your little jokes by-and-by." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{like that}} man; he understands me!' <b>I</b> once <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say,</b> {{mentioning}} my name, and believing {{that he was}} thinking, not speaking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rebuked you, Mr. Mason! He {{did not do}} that {{intentionally}} I am sure. <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> {{that you}} are an excellent son." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{he must be}} my father, sir, for <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> {{that there}} had been no other Darrien in the service for a hundred years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, Ebbo, {{he thought}} thy part most gallant. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> so, {{not only to}} me, but below stairs--both wise and true. Thou didst know him then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, sir, when {{we spoke}} the enemy, last night, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say,</b> through his trumpet, {{that he was}} Captain Parker; and very likely he knows his own name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> it was {{a little}} short of two miles deep, so it has {{got a long way to}} sink before it reaches its oozy bed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Caddy!" [...] said Mr. Jellyby, looking slowly round {{from the}} wail. It {{was the first}} time, I think, <b>I</b> ever <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> three words together.|$|R
6000|$|Him I {{followed}} {{one night}} To this place without light, And, ere <b>I</b> spoke, <b>heard</b> <b>Him</b> <b>say,</b> word by word, At {{the end of}} his winding, The darkness unminding:- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A little snob, ma'am. I have {{no other}} word, though he is your grandson. <b>I</b> never <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> a good word of any mortal soul, or do a kind action." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{has kept}} himself of late away; Yet,--in short, he's coming, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> - [...] That lover of yours - To this very spot {{on this very}} day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wonderful!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say.</b> [...] "I {{believe you}} have eyes in the ends of your fingers. Take this, now--and try if {{you can tell me}} what it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do find it, for papa's sake; there's a good fellow. He {{will be so}} wretched {{without his}} money. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> that he had only two pounds in his purse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know your}} name very well, Major Grantly. My {{brother-in-law}} who lives over yonder, Mr. Dale, knows your father very well,--or he did some years ago. And <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> that he remembers you." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{have loved}} {{the people of}} the tribe of Banu Tamim, ever since <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> three things the Messenger of Allaah, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, said about them. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>saying,</b> 'these people (of the tribe of Banu Tamim) would stand firm against the Dajjaal.' When the Saddaqat from that tribe came, the Messenger of Allaah, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, said, [...] "these are the Saddaqat (charitable gifts) of our folk." [...] Aa'ishah had a slave girl from that tribe, and the Prophet, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, said to Aa'ishah, 'manumit her as she is a {{descendant}} of Ismaa'eel, alayhis salaam." ...|$|R
5000|$|It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that Safwaan ibn al-Mu’attal al-Sulami al Dhakwaani was {{lagging behind}} the army. She said, “He came to where I had stopped {{and saw the}} black shape of a person sleeping. He {{recognized}} me when he saw me, because he had seen me before Hijāb was enjoined. I woke up when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>saying</b> ‘Inna Lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon (verily to Allaah we belong and unto Him is our return),’ and I covered my face with my Jilbāb.” (Narrated by al-Bukhāri, kitāb al maghazi - bābu Hadīth ul ifk, 4141; Muslim, 2770) ...|$|R
6000|$|The baggage-camel {{had been}} bobbing {{his head to}} and fro for some time past, anxious to {{get a word in}} edgewise. Then <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say,</b> as he cleared his throat, nervously: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would save}} you from Matai Shang," [...] <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say.</b> [...] "You know the fate that awaits you at his hands. Would you not choose me {{rather than the}} other?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> so, sir. I {{went into}} {{the place where he}} was, to look for some people who are wanted, and saw your son sitting with a {{well-known}} rough of the name of North, who has become a changed man, however, and has put on the blue ribbon. I knew North well, and recognised your son at once. North seemed to have been trying to persuade your boy to return," [...] ("bless him! bless him!" [...] from Mrs Twitter), [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> as I passed--`Oh! no, no, no, I can never return home!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Resumin' afresh," [...] said Mr. Pyecroft, after a well-watered interval, [...] "I {{may as well}} {{say that}} the target-practice {{occupied}} us two hours, {{and then we had}} to dig out after the tramp. Then we half an' three-quarters cleaned up the decks an' mucked about as requisite, haulin' down the patent awnin' stun'sles which Number One 'ad made. The old man was a shade doubtful of his course, 'cause <b>I</b> <b>'eard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> to Number One, 'You were right. A week o' this would turn the ship into a Hayti bean-feast. But,' he says pathetic, 'haven't they backed the band noble?' ...|$|R
60|$|Although Mr. Gulliver {{was born}} in Nottinghamshire, where his father dwelt, yet <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> his family came from Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have {{observed}} in the churchyard at Banbury in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.|$|R
6000|$|Felix {{interrupted}} rather hotly: 'Only my father's. <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> <b>say,</b> {{that if one}} is not a {{man before}} one is a parson, one brings the ministry into contempt. The things the boys call you Tina for are not what make a good clergyman.' ...|$|R
