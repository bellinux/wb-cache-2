Although France had not {{completely}} defeated them, the Treaty of Schönbrunn, signed on 14 October 1809, imposed a heavy political, territorial, and <b>economic</b> <b>price.</b> France received Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports, while Galicia was given to France's ally Poland. The Salzburg area went to the French ally, Bavaria. Austria lost over three million subjects, about 20 percent of her total population, which dramatically reduced the military force that Austria could field. Francis also agreed to pay an indemnity equivalent to almost 85 million francs, gave recognition to Joseph Bonaparte as the King of Spain, and affirmed Habsburg participation in Napoleon's Continental System. Francis reluctantly agreed to Napoleon's marriage with his daughter, Marie Louise, which Napoleon assumed, incorrectly, would eliminate Austria as a future threat.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In certain circles, demand {{management}} {{is seen as}} {{one and the same}} thing as <b>economic</b> <b>pricing.</b> This thinking is stimulated by the Dublin principle that water should be considered an eco-nomic good. But is this reasoning correct? Is <b>economic</b> <b>pricing</b> an adequate means to reach more desirable levels of demand? There is considerable misunderstanding about what the concept of water as an economic good implies. In this paper it is argued that water pricing should primarily serve the purpose of financial sustainability through cost recovery. Moreover, in water pricing, adequate atten-tion should be given to equity considerations through, for example, increasing block tariffs. Instead of <b>economic</b> <b>pricing</b> {{there is a need for}} defining a reasonable price, which provides full cost recovery but which safeguards ecological requirements and access to safe water for the poor. Giving a reasonable price to water has the additional benefit that it sends out a clear signal to the users that water should be used wisely, but the prime target of water pricing remains cost recovery. A major argument of neo-classical economists is that <b>economic</b> <b>pricing</b> of water will facilitate the re-allocation of water from sectors with lower added value (such as agriculture) to sectors with a higher added value (such as urban water use). However, the value of alternative uses of irrigation water is often grossly over-esti-mated. Adequate and effective regulations may suffice in order to achieve the optimal allocation of water resources...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive literature review on applications of <b>economic</b> and <b>pricing</b> theory to security issues in wireless networks. Unlike wireline networks, the broadcast {{nature and the}} highly dynamic change of network environments pose a number of nontrivial challenges to security design in wireless networks. While the security issues have not been completely solved by traditional or system-based solutions, <b>economic</b> and <b>pricing</b> models recently were employed as one efficient solution to discourage attackers and prevent attacks to be performed. In this paper, we review <b>economic</b> and <b>pricing</b> approaches proposed to address major security issues in wireless networks including eavesdropping attack, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack such as jamming and Distributed DoS (DDoS), and illegitimate behaviors of malicious users. Additionally, we discuss integrating <b>economic</b> and <b>pricing</b> models with cryptography methods to reduce information privacy leakage {{as well as to}} guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of information in wireless networks. Finally, we highlight important challenges, open issues and future research directions of applying <b>economic</b> and <b>pricing</b> models to wireless security issues...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive literature review on applications of <b>economic</b> and <b>pricing</b> theory for resource {{management in the}} evolving fifth generation (5 G) wireless networks. The 5 G wireless networks are envisioned to overcome existing limitations of cellular networks in terms of data rate, capacity, latency, energy efficiency, spectrum efficiency, coverage, reliability, and cost per information transfer. To achieve the goals, the 5 G systems will adopt emerging technologies such as massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO), mmWave communications, and dense Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets). However, 5 G involves multiple entities and stakeholders that may have different objectives, e. g., high data rate, low latency, utility maximization, and revenue/profit maximization. This poses a number of challenges to resource management designs of 5 G. While the traditional solutions may neither efficient nor applicable, <b>economic</b> and <b>pricing</b> models have been recently developed and adopted as useful tools to achieve the objectives. In this paper, we review <b>economic</b> and <b>pricing</b> approaches proposed to address resource management issues in the 5 G wireless networks including user association, spectrum allocation, and interference and power management. Furthermore, we present applications of <b>economic</b> and <b>pricing</b> models for wireless caching and mobile data offloading. Finally, we highlight important challenges, open issues and future research directions of applying <b>economic</b> and <b>pricing</b> models to the 5 G wireless networks...|$|R

To achieve sustainable profit advantage, cost reduction, and flexibility in provisioning of cloud resources, resource management in cloud networking requires adaptive and robust designs to address many issues, e. g., resource allocation, bandwidth reservation, request allocation, and workload allocation. <b>Economic</b> and <b>pricing</b> models {{have received a}} lot of attention as they can lead to desirable performance in terms of social welfare, fairness, truthfulness, profit, user satisfaction, and resource utilization. This paper reviews applications of the <b>economic</b> and <b>pricing</b> models to develop adaptive algorithms and protocols for resource management in cloud networking. Besides, we survey a variety of incentive mechanisms using the pricing strategies in sharing resources in edge computing. In addition, we consider using pricing models in cloud-based Software Defined Wireless Networking (cloud-based SDWN).
