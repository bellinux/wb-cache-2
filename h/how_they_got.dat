As the two are driving home {{from a trip to}} town, Barbara swerves to avoid a dog and the car plunges into a river. After they return home, Adam decides to retrace their steps as they can't recall <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> home. Upon stepping outside he's taken to a desert world with monstrous sandworms before being pulled back in by Barbara. Even though he had been gone for less than a minute Barbara claims he had been gone for over an hour. She and Adam notice that they now lack reflections and they discover a Handbook for the Recently Deceased and realize they did not survive the crash.|$|E
5|$|Arriving {{back in the}} wilderness, {{the trio}} sets up camp when Snatchers find and chase them down. Hermione strikes Harry with a curse to {{disguise}} his features as the Snatchers take them all to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix Lestrange imprisons Harry and Ron in the cellar with Luna, Ollivander, and Griphook the goblin. Bellatrix then tortures Hermione for information on <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> the sword of Gryffindor, which Bellatrix claims was in her vault at Gringott's. Harry requests help, communicating {{with a piece of}} broken mirror in his possession. Dobby apparates into the cellar to save them. Harry and Ron rush to save Hermione, and a battle ensues that sees Harry disarm Draco Malfoy. Dobby drops a chandelier above Bellatrix, forcing her to release Hermione. Bellatrix throws her knife at them as Dobby grabs everyone and disapparates. They arrive at Shell Cottage and find that Bellatrix's knife has fatally wounded Dobby. Harry insists that they bury Dobby properly without any magic, which they all agree to do.|$|E

25|$|Hall {{passed the}} {{telegram}} to the Foreign Office on 5 February, but still warned against releasing it. Meanwhile, the British discussed possible cover stories: {{to explain to}} the Americans <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> the ciphertext of the telegram without admitting to their ability to intercept American diplomatic communications (which they would continue to do for another 25 years); and to explain <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> the cleartext of the telegram without letting the Germans know their codes were broken. Furthermore, the British needed {{to find a way to}} convince the Americans the message was not a forgery.|$|E
25|$|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern find {{themselves}} on a ship that has already set sail. The audience is {{led to believe that}} the pair has no knowledge of <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> there. At first, they try to determine whether they are still alive. Eventually, they recognize that they are not dead and are on board a boat. They remember that Claudius had given them a letter to deliver to England. After some brief confusion over who actually has the letter, they find it and end up opening it. They realize that Claudius has asked for Hamlet to be killed. While Rosencrantz seems hesitant to follow their orders now, Guildenstern convinces him that they are not worthy of interfering with fate and with the plans of kings. The stage becomes black and, presumably, the characters go to sleep. Hamlet switches the letter with one he has written himself, an act which takes place off stage in Hamlet.|$|E

500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode {{three and a half}} stars out of five and called it [...] "an {{exercise}} in nostalgia". The two called the episode [...] "touching" [...] and noted that many of the in-jokes in the script, such as Harrison asking the agents <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> back from Antarctica, were [...] "very funny". Shearman and Pearson, however, did slightly critique the way the X-Files were presented noting that the case was comparatively a [...] "rather low-key humdrum affair". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a positive review, writing, [...] "The future of The X-Files is unsettled, but 'Alone' served as a pleasant reminder of what has come before and why the journey to this point has, for the most part, been so wonderful." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{interference}} {{from both the}} White and Black Guardians, the Doctor materialises the TARDIS in {{what appears to be}} the hold of an Edwardian vessel, though the Doctor senses something is amiss. The human crew have no idea <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> there nor where they are, but know they are helping their captain to run a race. The Doctor and his companions, Tegan and Turlough discover that the ship, and several other historical Earth ships, are competing in a solar sail race through the Solar System. The ship's officers reveal themselves to be Eternals, compared to the Doctor and the humans as Ephemerals. The Eternals live in the [...] "trackless wastes of eternity" [...] and rely on Ephemerals for their thoughts and ideas. This race is being run by the Guardians to win Enlightment, the wisdom to know everything. The Doctor finds that the Eternals have made his TARDIS vanish, forcing him and his companions to stay until the race's conclusion.|$|E

According to digital sheet music published at Musinotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, [...] "Summer Love" [...] {{was written in the}} key of D minor, in common time with a moderately slow 96 beat-per-minute tempo. Timberlake's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of D4 to the high note of A5. Its instrumentation consists of keyboards, drums, guitar, piano and handclaps. [...] Barry Schwartz of Stylus Magazine praised the song and commented that [...] "with its good foot hesitation boom-clap and cascading chorus synthline" [...] 'Summer Love' shows Timberlake's best vocals on FutureSex/LoveSounds." [...] Schwartz further stated that [...] "the beat drops out while he sings in perfect harmony, 'Tell me <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> that pretty little face on that pretty little frame girl'". [...] Lyrically, the single is about [...] "wanting {{to fall in love with}} the lusty seasonal lover".|$|E

2500|$|Prime {{responsibility}} for the celebrated spinwheel, which is largely individual and instinctive, rests with the Garrison Sergeant Major. [...] A 'wheel' {{is not an easy}} manoeuvre with even a small body of troops, and with a block of 400 men the normal wheel is impossible. The massed band therefore pivots on its own centre, so that certain outer ranks and files march long distances in a hurry while the centre and inner ranks loiter with extreme intent, or merely mark time. Yet others not only step sideways but backwards as well. This highly complex movement is called a 'spin-wheel', the details of which can be found in no drill book or manual of ceremonial. Its complexity defies description, and if the truth were known, many of the participants know not whither they go or, on arrival, <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> there. The spin-wheel is almost an art form and each performance of it, although similar in essentials, is different in detail. Most of the performers are adjusting their actions to suit the needs of the spin-wheel of the moment, having adjusted their movements quite otherwise on other occasions.|$|E
