5|$|McCudden's {{long-term}} interest in mechanics {{prompted him to}} modify his own aircraft to increase combat performance. He {{made a series of}} modifications to his aircraft which caused them to excel in performance in comparison to any other S.E.5 at the front and perhaps any other German fighter available at the time. Performance, a generic term, required improvements in all-round capability. McCudden's changes were made with one main objective in mind: high-altitude performance. He had achieved some success without these personal experiments. On 23 December 1917, for example, he intercepted an enemy aircraft at 18,000 feet and drove it down to 8,000 feet before shooting <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> his 30th victory. Incidentally, he was nearly killed in action when one of the wings broke away from his victim and nearly struck his own aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The {{force of}} {{friction}} is always exerted {{in a direction}} that opposes movement (for kinetic friction) or potential movement (for static friction) between the two surfaces. For example, a curling stone sliding along the ice experiences a kinetic force slowing <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> <b>For</b> an example of potential movement, the drive wheels of an accelerating car experience a frictional force pointing forward; if they did not, the wheels would spin, and the rubber would slide backwards along the pavement. Note {{that it is not the}} direction of movement of the vehicle they oppose, it is the direction of (potential) sliding between tire and road.|$|E

25|$|The journey {{began at}} Folly Bridge in Oxford and ended 3 miles (5km) north-west {{in the village}} of Godstow. During the trip, Dodgson told the girls a story that {{featured}} a bored little girl named Alice who goes looking for an adventure. The girls loved it, and Alice Liddell asked Dodgson to write <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> her. He began writing the manuscript of the story the next day, although that earliest version no longer exists. The girls and Dodgson took another boat trip a month later when he elaborated the plot to the story of Alice, and in November he began working on the manuscript in earnest.|$|E
25|$|An English {{translation}} {{was prepared}} in Cambridge by Frank Ramsey, a mathematics undergraduate at King's commissioned by C. K. Ogden. It was Moore who suggested Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus for the title, {{an allusion to}} Baruch Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus. Initially there were difficulties in finding a publisher for the English edition too, because Wittgenstein was insisting it appear without Russell's introduction; Cambridge University Press turned <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> that reason. Finally in 1922 an agreement was reached with Wittgenstein that Kegan Paul would print a bilingual edition with Russell's introduction and the Ramsey-Ogden translation. This is the translation that was approved by Wittgenstein, but it is problematic {{in a number of}} ways. Wittgenstein's English was poor at the time, and Ramsey was a teenager who had only recently learned German, so philosophers often prefer to use a 1961 translation by David Pears and Brian McGuinness.|$|E
25|$|On 4 July 1862, in a {{rowing boat}} {{travelling}} on the Isis from Folly Bridge, Oxford, to Godstow {{for a picnic}} outing, 10-year-old Alice asked Charles Dodgson (who wrote under the pen name Lewis Carroll) to entertain her and her sisters, Edith (aged 8) and Lorina (13), with a story. As the Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed the boat, Dodgson regaled the girls with fantastic stories of a girl, named Alice, and her adventures after she fell into a rabbit-hole. The story was not unlike those Dodgson had spun for the sisters before, but this time Liddell asked Mr. Dodgson to write <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> her. He promised to do so but did not get around to the task for some months. He eventually presented her with the manuscript of Alice's Adventures Under Ground in November 1864.|$|E

25|$|Franklin Pierce was {{a member}} of the U.S. House of Representatives by the time they married and became a U.S. Senator in 1837. She was forced to become the {{political}} wife she never wanted to be. Jane hated life in Washington, D.C., and encouraged her husband to resign his Senate seat and return to New Hampshire, which he did in 1842. She blamed politics for all the troubles in her life including the death of her child and Franklin's excessive alcohol consumption. Service in the Mexican-American War brought him the rank of Brigadier General and local fame as a hero. He returned home safely, and for four more years the Pierces lived quietly at Concord, New Hampshire. Unfortunately their son Frank passed from typhus a year later, causing stress for the entire family and leading to health issues for Jane. In 1842, President James K. Polk offered Franklin the U.S. attorney post; however, due to Jane's objection, he turned it down. A senate seat and New Hampshire governor was also offered, and again he turned <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> family reasons.|$|E
25|$|Eight {{minutes into}} the second half, a high tackle by Justin Hodges on Cameron Smith close to the Broncos' line {{resulted}} in a minor scuffle and a penalty to the Storm. Melbourne captain Smith {{decided to take the}} tap and attack Brisbane's line and a close-range try to Matt King resulted. The scores were then level at 8-all, with the kick to come. Smith, also the Storm's first-choice goal-kicker, was having a problem with his kicking leg so the task fell onto Matt Geyer whose conversion attempt went wide. Ten minutes later a penalty was awarded to the Broncos after a high shot from Billy Slater on Shaun Berrigan and Corey Parker's kick was successful, giving his side a two-point lead at 10-8. Following the restart kick from Melbourne, Brisbane were working the ball out of their own half and on the fifth tackle scored a brilliant Grand Final try. From dummy-half Berrigan ran then passed back inside to Lockyer who gave a short ball on to Parker who did likewise for Casey McGuire. Before being tackled McGuire tossed the ball blindly back over his head and it was picked up by Lockyer who spun out of a tackle then passed it to Tonie Carroll. Without losing momentum, Carroll passed the ball on to a flying Brent Tate who raced to the corner for the try. The conversion attempt from near the sideline was missed by Parker so the Broncos led by six with seventeen minutes of play remaining. A couple of minutes later the Storm appeared to have scored their third try when a bomb by Cronk was leapt for but unsuccessfully taken by both a Brisbane and a Melbourne player. On its way down the ball was snatched from the air by King who looked to have put <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> his second try but the video referee ruled that the ball had gone forward off the Storm so it was disallowed. In the seventy-third minute, after a strong run by prop Shane Webcke (the oldest player on the field) put him in good field position, Lockyer snapped away a successful field goal. This gave the Broncos a 7-point buffer. A frustrated Melbourne side were unable to score in the remaining minutes as Brisbane ground their way towards full-time, the score 15-8 at the final siren.|$|E

England took an early lead, when Tarr put Mobbs in for a try in the opening stages. That try {{has been described by}} his contemporary, rugby journalist and author E. H. D.

500|$|According to Staten, Tor Books asked Bungie if {{they had}} someone suited to writing the next novel; Staten, having written much of the Halo series canon, was the obvious choice. The author found that the book was {{the perfect way to}} {{elaborate}} on the Halo story without stripping <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> a video game: [...] "I always felt we shortchanged [...] We don't {{have a lot of time}} to tell story while the bullets are flying." [...] In addition, Staten said that the novel was the perfect way to do the character of Sergeant Johnson—who had appeared somewhat one-dimensional in the games—proper justice as a well-rounded character. Replying to G4TV's question about writing action, Staten replied that he felt that writing [...] "involves slowing things down", in comparison to a game of Halo. The author also said that the work of his favorite science-fiction authors helped teach him the importance of honing a [...] "strong, consistent voice".|$|E
500|$|Though {{previous}} Halo novels {{had been}} written by professional writers like Eric Nylund and William C. Dietz, publisher Tor Books chose Staten to write the fifth Halo novelization, entitled [...] Editor Eric Raab noted in the book's press release that [...] "who better to tell the tale" [...] of humanity's encounter with the antagonistic alien Covenant than Staten, who had [...] "intimate knowledge" [...] of the series' story. The novel is an ensemble piece, with the action being narrated from both human and alien viewpoints; the work of Staten's favorite science-fiction authors helped teach him the importance of honing a [...] "strong, consistent voice". Staten found that writing compelling action involved slowing things down, paradoxically {{the opposite of the}} fast-paced gameplay of a Halo title. He considered the book the perfect way to elaborate on the Halo story without stripping <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> a video game, and flesh out the character of Avery Johnson more than the games had allowed.|$|E

500|$|Milian {{received}} writing {{credit for}} nine {{songs on the}} album. Milian {{did not try to}} write mainstream records for the radio; rather, she wrote about [...] "everything, about your life and concentrate on you doing you." [...] For previous albums, Milian wrote about things that had happened in the past, whereas for So Amazin, she focused on the present. She compared the writing process to writing a diary; whenever she would experience something that she thought would be important, she would write <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> future reference. Milian felt that by writing down true experiences, her songs were like [...] "captured emotion". When writing songs, Milian said that the amount of time it took to write varied. It would depend on what she was writing about, {{what was going on in}} her life, and if it pertained to that exact moment. Sometimes the process was quick, but other times it could take several hours to write an entire song.|$|E
500|$|Musically True Blue was a {{different}} direction for Madonna. Her previous efforts had her singing in a high pitched voice. With this album, Madonna toned <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> a more bubblegum-pop voice.

[...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] features acoustic, electric, and rhythm guitars, keyboards, and string arrangements. The song samples Beethoven's Appassionata sonata. A continuous percussion filled structure was used in [...] "Open Your Heart". [...] "White Heat" [...] sampling of the film's quotation was included with speech and gunshots. It is an uptempo dance song with synth bass and double-tracked vocals supported by male voices in the chorus. [...] "I don't write dance music and I don't see it as contributing to the cultural growth of the world," [...] grumbled Pat Leonard in 1992.

500|$|In 1952, O'Hara played Claire, the {{daughter}} of the musketeer, Athos in At Sword's Point, which according to her showed the [...] "new Maureen O'Hara". [...] The film had actually been made in 1949 but was not released until 1952. The role was the most physically demanding of her career, doing her own stunts and training in the art of fencing for six weeks under the Belgian-born fencing master, Fred Cavens. [...] She disliked director Lewis Allen and producer Howard Hughes, whom she thought was [...] "cold as ice". The critic from The New York Times appreciated O'Hara's swordsmanship in the film, stating that she was [...] "snarling like a Fury, impales her opponents as though she were threading a needle." [...] O'Hara next played Irish immigrant Australian-based cowgirl, Dell McGuire, in Lewis Milestone's drama Kangaroo (1952), set during the drought of 1900. Kangaroo is noted for being the first Technicolor film to be shot on-location in Australia, mostly shot in the desert near Port Augusta. Although O'Hara disliked the production, she found the Australians extremely welcoming. The Australian government offered her a plot of land during the production to own permanently but she turned <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> political reasons only to later discover that there were significant oil reserves on the land.|$|E
