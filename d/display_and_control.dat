25|$|Personalized {{tourniquet}} instruments have digital {{displays and}} easy-to-use user interfaces. Typically, the tourniquet instrument allows the perioperative staff {{to set the}} tourniquet pressure, inflate or deflate the tourniquet cuff, and adjust safety settings such as the maximum allowed pressure and time limits. The digital <b>display</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> buttons give the surgical staff a straightforward method of monitoring the tourniquet pressure and time, and for changing the various tourniquet settings. Personalized tourniquet instruments have non-volatile memory to enable surgical staff to store specialized settings most appropriate for certain surgeries (e.g. paediatric and hand surgery), relevant data about significant surgical events related to tourniquet usage, and to enable a data printout or transfer to an operating room information network. In addition, personalized tourniquet instruments use intuitive audio-visual alarms to alert the surgical staff of events related to patient safety.|$|E
