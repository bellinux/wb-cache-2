40|$|Theoretical {{analyses}} and experimental {{observations of the}} failure and fracture behaviors of piezoelectric materials are presented. The theoretical analyses {{are based on the}} Stroh formalism. A strip dielectric breakdown model is proposed to estimate the effect of electrical non-linearity on the piezoelectric fracture of electrically insulated cracks. The reviewed experiments include the indentation <b>fracture</b> <b>test,</b> the bending test on smooth samples, the <b>fracture</b> <b>test</b> on prenotched or pre-cracked samples, the environment-assisted <b>fracture</b> <b>test,</b> etc. For electrically insulated cracks, the experimental results show a complicated fracture behavior under combined electrical and mechanical loading. Fracture data are greatly scattered when a static electric field is applied. For electrically conducting cracks, the experimental results demonstrate that static electric fields can fracture poled and depoled lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramics. A charge-free zone model is introduced to understand the failure behavior of conducting cracks in the depoled lead zirconate titanate ceramics under electrical and/or mechanical loading.

A flexural bending beam test was used to obtain two fatigue parameters, which include a traditional fatigue criterion based on stress or strain to find number of cycles to failure and a new fatigue criterion based on an energy approach known as the plateau value (PV). Similarly, a disk-shaped compact tension DC(T) <b>fracture</b> <b>test</b> was used to obtain fracture energy parameters, including: fracture strength, pre-peak fracture energy, post-peak fracture energy, and total fracture energy.

This performance {{is due to}} highly evolved hierarchical designs. Building a comprehensive understanding of the multi-scale mechanisms that enable this performance represents a critical step toward realizing strong and tough bio-inspired materials. This paper details a multi-scale experimental investigation into the toughening mechanisms in natural nacre. By applying extended digital image correlation and other image processing techniques, quantitative information is extracted from otherwise prodominantly qualitative experiments. In situ three point bending <b>fracture</b> <b>tests</b> are performed to identify and quantify the toughening mechanisms involved during the fracture of natural nacre across multiple length scales.
