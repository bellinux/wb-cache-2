500|$|Shortly after Mangini joined Dream Theater, Portnoy e-mailed {{the band}} asking to rejoin, but his attempt was rebuffed. Reflecting on his arrival to the band, Mangini told Noisecreep, [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> I look back, I really think what {{happened}} was that this band kind of started over. They were in a new place as they looked for a drummer, and I when got the news, after the shock wore off, I knew what I wanted to do – which was just basically come in and try to support where they wanted to go. They had a vision, they had great ideas, and I just wanted to help them achieve those things." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{recording}} sessions between West and Brion {{were largely}} exploratory, {{with the two}} experimenting with {{a broad spectrum of}} sounds. West would construct a song's basic structure, bringing in samples, drum beat programming and occasionally unfinished rap verses. After brainstorming over the musical direction the album could go, he would then select from a variety of unique instruments that Brion provided (and played) and attempt to incorporate their distinctive sound into the song's texture. West envisioned the album as like the creation of a film: visualizing the songs as scenes, outlining each {{in such a way that}} they efficiently conveyed their respective social or introspective context, and ensuring that all synchronized within the fabric of the complete set. This sentiment was shared by Jon Brion who said, [...] "He thinks in frequency ranges. I can recognize when someone sees music architecturally, which is how I work. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a spatial thing: left to right, front to back, up and down. It's animated and it's moving in real time. Kanye has that. He tries things out until it fits, until it sits where it is supposed to sit and everything has the correct emotional function. He has real instincts like any great record-maker." ...|$|E
500|$|Saadiq titled The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>as</b> a {{declaration}} to music listeners {{about how his}} perspective was more informed by classic soul than before in his career: [...] "This is what I really love, and everything you’ve heard from me before {{has been based on}} the roots of this music." [...] The cover photo was taken at a show in 2006 at Sweet's Ballroom in Oakland, in which Saadiq performed Marvin Gaye's 1965 song [...] "Ain't That Peculiar". It showed Saadiq singing into a microphone with his arms raised and wearing a suit, tie, and thick-rimmed glasses: a look similar to that of Temptations singer David Ruffin. According to Saadiq, the photo [...] "set the tone for the whole album ... me singing that song, me wearing that suit, it said everything that this album should be." [...] Music journalist Greg Kot believed the cover [...] "evokes the dramatic portraits and color schemes of old-school jazz and soul albums. Think Ray Charles on Atlantic, Sonny Rollins on Blue Note, Sam and Dave on Stax ... With arms raised, he looks like he's testifying as much as singing." [...] The rest of the album's packaging also adheres to a retro aesthetic with its crimson-tinted cover's font and 1960s Columbia Records logo. The packaging's photography was taken by Norman Seeff.|$|E

500|$|Current socio-political {{issues in}} the United States are {{addressed}} on the album, with Vedder claiming the record [...] "deals with real content and the moral issues of our time", and crediting as inspiration both the frustration with George W. Bush being reelected, {{and the birth of}} Vedder's daughter - [...] "Now that <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> my daughter's planet, I'm even more (angry)." [...] McCready said, [...] "We all feel that we're living in tumultuous, frightening times, and that ranges from the Iraq war to Hurricane Katrina to wiretapping to anything that smacks of totalitarianism. And just bad political decisions being made. We feel that as Americans, and we're frustrated. So a lot of those feelings have come out in these songs." [...] Vedder also added that among all the dark themes [...] "the hope {{was going to be in}} the guitar solos. It was the guitars and drums going at it that was going to lift you out of the dark abyss that I had painted." [...] The Iraq War is addressed in the songs [...] "World Wide Suicide", [...] "Marker in the Sand", and [...] "Army Reserve". The lyrics of [...] "World Wide Suicide" [...] depict anger against the war. Other themes addressed on the album include alcohol use ("Severed Hand"), religion ("Marker in the Sand"), poverty ("Unemployable"), leaving everything behind to seek a fresh start ("Gone"), and loneliness ("Come Back").|$|E
500|$|Becky {{formed a}} {{friendship}} with local residents Roy (David Neilson) and Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh). Becky's on-screen partnership with Roy was particularly successful. Kelly stated it was the turning point in her character's development that won public affection, whilst Neilson stated {{that it was an}} [...] "arranged marriage" [...] by producers, delighted with its outcome. Becky's first serious romantic relationship in the soap was with builder Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas). Their relationship was a turning point in what {{has been described as a}} [...] "journey" [...] for the character. Kelly spoke of Becky's different attributes in their relationship, during an interview stating: [...] "She absolutely believes that she's 100% in love with him. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a very teenage relationship because of the on-off status. Becky's very mature in many ways– she's very streetwise and if you needed something, you'd go to Becky and she'd find it for you. But emotionally, she's very immature. That's a lot to do with why she gets on so well with Roy because he's quite emotionally immature, too. It's probably the one level that they do connect on." [...] Fans approached the actress in the streets, claiming they were jealous of her because of her on-screen romance with Jason. Following her breakup with Jason, and the aftermath which was highly publicised in the media, such as the Daily Mirror, and The Sun commenting on the plot.|$|E

Said Dr. Lance Barrett-Lennard: [...] "Her rescue, relocation, reunification with relatives and transition to motherhood is an incredible story. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> testimony to both the resiliency of killer whales as a species and to the wonderful things we humans can do when we work together on behalf of — rather than against — nature." ...|$|E

"I don't look at Chasing Ice {{as being}} a film about climate change. <b>I</b> like to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an {{adventure}} story about James Balog, about this photographer," [...] Orlowski told Lifestyler magazine in 2012. [...] "In the front we get to learn about climate change, we get to deliver {{the message of the}} science through James as storyteller, the protagonist.

"It saddens me that {{official}} Israel so doggedly {{refuses to}} allow Wagner {{to be performed}} – as was the case, once again, at the University of Tel Aviv two weeks ago – because <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> {{a symptom of a}} disease. The words I'm about to use are harsh, but I choose them deliberately: There is a politicization of the remembrance of the Holocaust in Israel, and that's terrible."

2500|$|Many {{men were}} {{supporters}} of riot grrrl culture and acts. Calvin Johnson and Slim Moon have {{been instrumental in}} publishing riot grrrl bands on the labels they founded, K Records and Kill Rock Stars respectively. Alec Empire of Atari Teenage Riot said, [...] "I was totally into the riot grrrl music, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a very important form of expression. I {{learned a lot from}} that, way more maybe than from 'male' punk rock." [...] Dave Grohl and Kurt Cobain dated Kathleen Hanna and Tobi Vail (also respectively), and often played with Bikini Kill even after splitting with them; Kurt was a big fan of The Slits and even convinced The Raincoats to reform. He once said, [...] "The future of rock belongs to women." [...] Many riot grrrl bands included male band members, such as Billy Karren of Bikini Kill or Jon Slade and Chris Rawley of Huggy Bear.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{international}} {{criticism has}} {{centered around the}} government of Karzai in early 2009 for failing to secure the country from Taliban attacks, systemic governmental corruption, and widespread claims of electoral fraud in the 2009 Afghan presidential election. Karzai staunchly defended the election balloting, stating that some statements criticizing the balloting and vote count were [...] "totally fabricated." [...] He told the media that, [...] "There were instances of fraud, no doubt... There were irregularities... But the election {{as a whole was}} good and free and democratic." [...] He further went on to say that, [...] "Afghanistan has its separate problems and we have to handle them as Afghanistan finds it feasible... This country was completely destroyed... Today, we are talking about fighting corruption in Afghanistan, improved legal standards... You see the glass half empty or half full. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> half full.

2500|$|While {{giving a}} {{teleconference}} interview with NBA.com, Nocioni {{spoke about the}} hard fouls and his suspension, [...] "First, the one with Wade was completely my fault. It was a bad reaction on my part. If I had received any penalties because of it, {{it would be a}} fair sanction, but it was not given. However, the sanction set after the game against the Pistons is totally unfair. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a totally real play taken out of context in the game — absolutely nothing happened. It was an accidental blow. Without purposely trying to, I hit him. I apologized on the court. I also asked Carlos Delfino to give my apologies to him, so I don't understand why there is a sanction for something totally normal in a game." [...] In Nocioni's first NBA playoff game, he scored 25 points and grabbed 18 rebounds while playing all 48minutes. Due to his outstanding play, the sold-out United Center crowd in Chicago chanted his name. This game solidified Nocioni's status as a Chicago favorite.|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{also saw}} the {{potential}} political changes in the Mideast {{as an opportunity for}} an even more fundamental change to take place, that being the empowerment of women (something Newsweek magazine saw as Clinton's categorical imperative). She made remarks to this effect in countries such as Egypt – [...] "If a country doesn't recognize minority rights and human rights, including women's rights, you will not have the kind of stability and prosperity that is possible" [...] – as well as in Yemen, where she spoke of the story of the present Nujood Ali and her campaign against forced marriage at a young age. At home, Clinton was even more expansive, looking on a worldwide basis: [...] "I believe that the rights of women and girls is the unfinished business of the 21st century. We see women and girls across the world who are oppressed and violated and demeaned and degraded and denied so much of what they are entitled to as our fellow human beings." [...] She also maintained that the well-being of women in other countries was a direct factor in American self-interest: [...] "This is a big deal for American values and for American foreign policy and our interests, {{but it is also a}} big deal for our security. Because where women are disempowered and dehumanized, you are more likely to see not just antidemocratic forces, but extremism that leads to security challenges for us." [...] She subsequently elaborated upon this theme, saying [...] "A lot of the work I do here in the State Department on women's or human-rights issues is not just because I care passionately – which I do – but because <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> [...] to increase security to fulfill American interests. These are foreign-policy and national-security priorities for me." ...|$|E

Only twice in my life had I been at the seaside before, and then I had gone by excursion to places on the Welsh coast whose great cliffs of rock and mountain backgrounds made the effect of the horizon very different from what it is upon the East Anglian seaboard.
