40|$|Six 100 -octane and two 87 -octane {{aviation}} engine fuels {{were tested}} in a modified C. F. R. variable-compression engine at 1, 500, 2, 000 and 2, 500 rpm. The mixture temperature was raised from 50 to 300 F in approximately 50 degree steps and, at each temperature, the compression ratio was adjusted to give incipient knock as shown by a cathode ray indicator. The results are presented in tabular form. The results are analyzed {{on the assumption that}} the conditions which determine whether a given fuel will knock are the maximum values of density and temperature reached by the burning gases. A maximum permissible density factor, proportional to the maximum density of the burning gases just prior to incipient knock, and the temperature of the burning gases at that time were computed for each of the test conditions. Values of the density factors were plotted against the corresponding end-gas temperatures for the three engine speeds and also against engine speed for several and end-gas temperatures. The maximum permissible density factor varied only slightly with engine speed but decreased rapidly with an increase in the end-gas temperature. The effect of changing the mixture temperature was different for fuels of different types. The results emphasize the desirability of determining the anti <b>knock</b> <b>values</b> of fuels over a wide range of engine and intake-air conditions rather that at a single set of conditions...|$|R

25|$|Scattles is {{a version}} of {{skittles}} {{in which all the}} pins are numbered. Players take turn in throwing the baton at the pins with a view to totalling exactly 50 points. If more than one pin is knocked over, the score received is that quantity of pins. But if only one pin is <b>knocked</b> over, the <b>value</b> on it is scored. If a player exceeds 50, their total reduces to 25. Pins are then placed upright where they stand, thus scattering. Scattles is made by Jaques of London and reminiscent of the older Cornish game, smite, itself based on the Finnish skittles game mölkky.|$|R
40|$|Variable {{compression}} ratio is {{the technology to}} adjust internal combustion engine cylinder {{compression ratio}} to increase fuel efficiency while under varying loads. The paper presents a new design of a variable compression ratio engine that allows for the volume above the piston at Top Dead Centre (TDC) to be changed. A modeling study is then performed using the WAVE engine performance simulation code for a naturally aspirated gasoline V 8 engine. The modeling study shows significant improvements of fuel economy over {{the full range of}} loads and especially during light loads operation as well as an improvement of top power and torque outputs.

40|$|An {{approach}} for predicting {{the onset of}} knock and estimating its intensity in spark ignition engines is described. It is based on evaluating a dimensionless energy functional group, Kn, formulated to provide a numerical criterion to test continually, while using predictive models {{of the performance of}} spark ignition engines, for the onset of knock and its relative intensity at any instant during the combustion process. The basis for the derivation of this knock criterion and its significance are described. Examples involving gaseous fuels and their mixtures under different operating conditions show how the criterion can be employed for the prediction of the onset of knock and the associated knock-limited performance. It is shown that this approach can be made an integral part of modeling spark ignition engine operation to be used for optimizing engine performance while ensuring throughout the avoidance of the onset of knock.

40|$|Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) {{combustion}} is {{an alternative}} combustion mode in which the fuel is homogeneously mixed with air and is auto-ignited by compression. Due to charge homogeneity, this mode is characterized by low equivalence ratios and temperatures giving simultaneously low nitric oxide (NOx) and soot in diesel engines. The conventional problem of NOx-soot trade-off is avoided in this mode due to absence of diffusion combustion. This mode can be employed at part load conditions while maintaining conventional combustion at high load thus minimizing regulatory cycle emissions and reducing cost of after-treatment systems. The present study focuses on achieving this mode in a turbocharged, common rail, direct injection, four-cylinder, heavy duty diesel engine. Specifically, the work involves a combination of three-dimensional CFD simulations and experiments on this engine to assess both traditional and novel strategies related to fuel injection. The {{first phase of the}} work involved a quasi-dimensional simulation of the engine to assess potential of achieving HCCI. This was done using a zero-dimensional, single-zone HCCI combustion model with n-heptane skeletal chemistry along with a one-dimensional model of intake and exhaust systems. The feasibility of operation with realistic <b>knock</b> <b>values</b> with high EGR rate of 60 % was observed. The second aspect of the work involved three-dimensional CFD simulations of the in-cylinder process with wall film prediction to evaluate injection strategies associated with Early Direct Injection (EDI). The extended Coherent Flame Model- 3 Zone (ECFM- 3 Z) was employed for combustion simulation of conventional CI and EDI, and was validated with experimental in-cylinder pressure data from the engine. A new Uniformity Index (UI) parameter was defined to assess charge homogeneity. Results showed significant in-homogeneity and presence of wall film for EDI. Simulations were conducted to assess improvement of charge homogeneity by several strategies; narrow spray cone angle, injection timing, multiple injections, intake air heating, Port Fuel Injection (PFI) as well as combination of PFI and EDI. The maximum UI achieved by EDI was 0. 78. The PFI strategy could achieve UI of 0. 95; however, up to 50 % of fuel remained trapped in the port after valve closure. This indicated that except EDI, none of the above-mentioned strategies could help achieve the benefits of the HCCI mode. The third part of the work involved engine experimentation to assess the EDI strategy. This strategy produced lower soot than that of conventional CI combustion with very short combustion duration, but led to high knock and NOx which is attributed to pool fire burning phenomenon of the wall film, as confirmed by CFD. An Optimized EDI (OptimEDI) strategy was then developed based on results of CFD and Design of Experiments. The Optim EDI consisted of triple injections with split ratio of 41 %- 45 %- 14 % and advancing the first injection. This strategy gave 20 % NOx and soot reduction over the conventional CI mode. Although this strategy gave encouraging results, there was a need for more substantial reduction in emissions without sacrificing efficiency. Hence, a novel concept of utilizing air-assisted Injection (AAI) into the EGR stream was employed, as this implied injecting very small droplets of fuel into the intake which would have sufficient residence time to evaporate before reaching the cylinder, thereby enabling HCCI. The fourth and final part of the work involved engine experimentation with AAI, and combination of OptimEDI with AAI. Results with 20 % EGR showed that 5 to 10 % of AAI gave further reduction in NOx but not in soot. With experiments involving 48 % EGR rate, there was soot reduction of 75 % due to combined AAI-EDI. NOx was negligible due to the high EGR rate. Thus, the significant contribution of this work is in proving that combining AAI with EDI as a novel injection strategy leads to substantial NOx and soot reduction...|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} relationship of autoignition delay time with temperature and pressure is employed to derive the propagation velocities of autoignitive reaction fronts for particular reactivity gradients, once autoignition has been initiated. In {{the present study}} {{of a variety of}} premixtures, with different {{functional relationship}}s, such gradients comprise fixed initial temperature gradients. The smaller is the ratio of the acoustic speed through the mixture to the localised velocity of the autoignitive front, the greater are the amplitude and frequency of the induced pressure wave. This might lead to damaging engine <b>knock.</b> At higher <b>values</b> of the ratio, the autoignition can be benign with only small over-pressures. This approach to the effects of autoignition is confirmed by its application to a variety of experimental studies involving:(i) Imposed temperature gradients in a rapid compression and expansion machine. (ii) Onset of knock in an engine with advancing spark timing. (iii) Development of autoignition at a single hot spot in an engine. (iv) Autoignition fronts initiated by several hot spots. There is much diversity in the effects that can be produced by different fuels in different ranges of temperature and pressure. Higher values of autoignitive propagation speeds lead to increasingly severe engine knock. Such effects cannot always be predicted from the Research and Motor octane numbers...|$|R
40|$|A {{diesel engine}} is {{modified}} for homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion with dimethyl ether. With and without knock, in-cylinder pressure is acquired, and in-cylinder temperature, {{rate of heat release}} (ROHR), pressure rise rate and pressure rise acceleration obtained. Wavelet packet transform is performed to decompose pressure signal into three layers with subsignals obtained. Three wavelet packet quantifiers for seven subsignals, including mean absolute value of coefficients, wavelet packet energy and entropy, are compared. The three quantifiers are correlated with maximum pressure rise rate and pressure rise acceleration, respectively. The analysis {{shows that the}} in-cylinder pressure, temperature and ROHR change smoothly in normal combustion. When combustion gets into knock, they have a steep rise and a strong fluctuation; the ROHR peaks increase for both cool flame and hot flame, and heat release advances, especially for hot flame. The pressure rise rate and pressure rise acceleration fluctuate more violently, and their maximums increase remarkably and advance somewhat. Without <b>knock,</b> mean absolute <b>value</b> of coefficients, wavelet packet energy and entropy for the subsignal 1 are much greater than others. As knock occurs, three wavelet packet quantifiers for seven subsignals increase greatly, and for the subsignal 6 becomes the largest. Wavelet packet quantifiers for seven subsignals should be monitored for knock detection. The correlation coefficient similarly increases first, decreases afterwards and increases again through seven subsignals. Among three wavelet packet quantifiers, mean absolute value of coefficients has the maximum correlation coefficient except for the subsignal 6. Its maximum correlation coefficient appears at subsignal 7, whose frequency band is 8. 75 - 10 Â kHz. Knock Combustion Wavelet packet transform HCCI Dimethyl ether...|$|R
