50|$|The <b>Idea-Man</b> / Креативщик (2009). A mysterious {{stranger}} {{walks the}} streets of Saint Petersburg, telling people strange and fascinating stories.|$|E
50|$|In 1960, {{he joined}} {{the staff of the}} SF fanzine Uchuujin. In 1961, he won the Best Story prize in the 1st Kuusou-Kagaku Shousetsu Contest (later the Hayakawa SF Contest) for his novella Kakyuu <b>Idea-Man</b> and made debut in the S-F Magazine by this work.|$|E
5000|$|The {{crew of the}} {{submarine}} chaser assume that Harkness is Regular Navy. Her chief boatswains mate, Chief Larrabee (Millard Mitchell), and her chief machinists mate are the only experienced seamen aboard. PC-1168s crew are all newly inducted civilians, and her officers recently commissioned [...] "90 day wonders". The exec, Lt. (j.g.) Barron (Eddie Albert), is a good-natured <b>idea-man</b> whose knowledge of seamanship is out of books. The engineering officer, Ens. Barbo (Jack Webb), has no training, education, or experience in engineering. And the supply-Mess officer, Ens. Dorrance (Richard Erdman), is plagued by seasickness.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "action figure" [...] {{was first}} coined by Hasbro in 1964, to market their G.I. Joe figure to boys {{who would not}} play with [...] "dolls". (A similar toy named Johnny Hero was {{introduced}} by Rosko Industries for Sears in 1965, but {{was known as a}} [...] "Boy's Doll" [...] since the term action figure had not gained widespread usage at that point). G.I. Joe was initially a military-themed 11.5-inch figure proposed by marketing and toy <b>idea-man</b> Stan Weston. It featured changeable clothes with various uniforms to suit different purposes.|$|E
5000|$|The band {{achieved}} immediate success and, {{during their}} first year performing together, the Kinshasa newspaper Elima named the band [...] "best orchestra" [...] and their single, [...] "Mère Supérieure," [...] best song. During the following three years, Viva la Musica built on these initial accolades with more hit songs including [...] "Moku Nyon Nyon", [...] "Nyekesse Migue'l", and [...] "Cou Cou Dindon". As time went by, {{it was revealed that}} Antoine Agbepa was the unknown writer of many of these songs, when Papa Wemba said, [...] "Ooh! l'homme idée" [...] (Oh! the <b>idea-man!),</b> thereby on-the-spot renaming the impressive young singer-songwriter Koffi Olomide - and the name stuck.|$|E
5000|$|The {{radioactive}} fallout from West Side Story {{must still be}} descending on Broadway this morning. Director, choreographer, and <b>idea-man</b> Jerome Robbins has put together, and then blasted apart, the most savage, restless, electrifying dance patterns we've been exposed to in a dozen seasons .... the show rides with a catastrophic roar over the spider-web fire-escapes, the shadowed trestles, and the plain dirt battlegrounds of a big city feud ... there is fresh excitement in the next debacle, and the next. When a gang leader advises his cohorts to play it [...] "Cool", the intolerable tension between an effort at control and the instinctive drives of these potential killers is stingingly graphic. When the knives come out, and bodies begin to fly wildly through space under buttermilk clouds, the sheer visual excitement is breathtaking .... Mr. Bernstein has permitted himself {{a few moments of}} graceful, lingering melody: in a yearning [...] "Maria", in the hushed falling line of [...] "Tonight", in the wistful declaration of [...] "I Have a Love". But for the most part he has served the needs of the onstage threshing machine ... When hero Larry Kert is stomping out the visionary insistence of [...] "Something's Coming" [...] both music and tumultuous story are given their due. Otherwise it's the danced narrative that takes urgent precedence ...|$|E
