5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from <b>it</b> <b>hung</b> a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E

25|$|In {{his last}} years Manet painted many {{small-scale}} still lifes {{of fruits and}} vegetables, such as Bunch of Asparagus and The Lemon (both 1880). He completed his last major work, A Bar at the Folies-Bergère (Un Bar aux Folies-Bergère), in 1882 and <b>it</b> <b>hung</b> in the Salon that year. Afterwards he limited himself to small formats. His last paintings were of flowers in glass vases.|$|E

25|$|Sam Browne VC was a British {{army officer}} serving in India in the 19th century. In those days {{officers}} always carried a sword into battle. <b>It</b> <b>hung</b> {{from a small}} metal clip on the waistbelt, called a 'frog'. However, the scabbard tended to slide around a lot when they charged the enemy, meaning {{that it had to}} be steadied with the left hand before being drawn.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} painting {{remained in}} Madrid until 1812, {{when it was}} taken by Joseph Bonaparte after his abdication as King of Spain. He took it {{with him when he}} went into exile in the United States, and <b>it</b> <b>hung</b> at his Point Breeze estate near Bordentown, New Jersey. The painting was handed down through his descendants until 1949, when his great grandniece, Eugenie Bonaparte, bequeathed it to the museum of the Château de Malmaison.|$|E
25|$|Fasanella's 5-foot by 10-foot painting, Lawrence 1912: The Great Strike (also titled Bread and Roses - Lawrence, 1912) was {{purchased}} by donations from 15 labor unions and the AFL-CIO. It was loaned to the United States Congress, where <b>it</b> <b>hung</b> for years in the Rayburn Office Building in the hearing room of the House Subcommittee on Labor and Education. Following the 1994 elections, a staffer for the new Republican majority in Congress had the painting removed from the hearing room {{and returned to the}} owners. The work now hangs at the Labor Museum and Learning Center in Flint, Michigan.|$|E

25|$|The {{painting}} was acquired in Italy by Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, {{the son of}} Princess Izabela Czartoryska and Prince Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski in 1798, and incorporated it into the Czartoryskis’ family collections at Puławy in 1800. The inscription on the top-left corner of the painting, LA BELE FERONIERE. LEONARD DAWINCI., probably was added by a restorer shortly after its arrival in Poland, and before the background was overpainted. Czartoryski was clearly aware it was a Leonardo, although the painting had never been discussed in print; unfortunately, no record exists of any previous owner. The Belle Ferronière is the Leonardo portrait in the Louvre, whose sitter bears such a close resemblance, the Czartoryskis considered this sitter to be the same. The painting travelled extensively during the 19th century; Princess Czartoryska rescued it {{in advance of the}} invading Russian army in 1830, hid it, then sent it to Dresden and on to the Czartoryski place of exile in Paris, the Hôtel Lambert, returning it to Kraków in 1882. In 1939, almost immediately after the German occupation of Poland, it was seized by the Nazis and sent to the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin. In 1940, Hans Frank, the Governor General of Poland, requested it be returned to Kraków, where <b>it</b> <b>hung</b> in his suite of offices. At the end of the Second World War it was discovered by Allied troops in Frank's country home in Bavaria. It has since been returned to Poland at the Czartoryski Museum in Kraków. Since May 2017, the painting may be found in a branch of the National Museum in Kraków, just outside the Old Town.|$|E

The smaller [...] bell was sent to the University of New Mexico, where <b>it</b> <b>hung</b> in Scholes Hall from 1948 to 1964 and subsequently in its own freestanding tower near Smith Plaza.|$|E
500|$|Lucy granddaughter, a Boston-area nurse named Susan Lawlor, {{became a}} fan of MOBA after seeing the {{portrait}} in a newspaper. She recognized it as her grandmother, Anna Lally Keane (c. 1890–1968); upon seeing the picture, Lawlor snorted Coca-Cola from her nose in astonishment. The painting was commissioned by her mother, and <b>it</b> <b>hung</b> in her aunt's house for many years, despite the trepidation family members felt at seeing the final composition. Says Lawlor: [...] "The face is hauntingly hers, but everything else is so horribly wrong. It looks like she only has one breast. I'm not sure {{what happened to her}} arms and legs, and I don't know where all the flowers and yellow sky came from." ...|$|E

500|$|Tuned {{to a low}} D bass clef, the bell's {{original}} home was the Wanamaker Building, a block from One South Broad. <b>It</b> <b>hung</b> [...] above the street in a specially built tower on the building's roof. Hung on December 23, 1926, the bell was first rung on New Year's Eve of that year. The bell is rung every hour, except on Sundays. The bell was originally intended to swing in the tower on top of One South Broad, but the swinging of the bell shook the building. A hammer driven by a 230-volt electric motor was later installed and currently rings the bell. The ringing of the bell, which can be heard for , is often mistakenly assumed to come from City Hall's clock tower across the street.|$|E
500|$|The painting, however, was safe; Mantashev had smuggled {{it out of}} the country, {{reportedly}} [...] "rip it out of its frame" [...] {{when the}} revolution broke out. In the early 1930s, in desperate need of funds, he sold September Morn to the Armenian art collector and philanthropist Calouste Gulbenkian for $30,000; it was the last painting he owned. A United Press reporter discovered the painting, which was framed as a tondo, in Gulbenkian's Paris home in 1935. There <b>it</b> <b>hung</b> with works by artists such as Claude Monet and Paul Cézanne. By 1937 September Morn was on display in the Musée du Luxembourg, hung between works by Jean-François Raffaëlli and Eugène Carrière. After Gulbenkian's death in 1955, the painting was acquired by Wildenstein and Company of New York.|$|E
500|$|Rockwell {{produced}} {{at least one}} depiction of Gillis that {{was not on the}} cover. The painting Willie Gillis in Convoy was produced in 1943, depicting Gillis, in combat gear, {{in the back of a}} covered military vehicle with his rifle in hand. Rockwell donated the painting to the Gardner High School for the graduating class, where <b>it</b> <b>hung</b> in the principal's office until 2000. [...] The school then loaned it to the Gardner Museum. [...] A charcoal sketch of the painting sold for $107,000 in 1999. [...] There was concern that the painting was not hung in a secure location. In 2005, the painting was restored and rehung at the high school. In 2014, it was sold for $1.9 million, with the proceeds used to create a foundation to benefit the schools in Gardner.|$|E

500|$|In later periods, life-size {{sculptures of}} the {{deceased}} reclining as though at a meal or social gathering are found, a common Etruscan style. [...] Family tombs for the grandest late Roman families, like the Tomb of the Scipios, were large mausoleums with facilities for visits by the living, including kitchens and bedrooms. [...] The Castel Sant'Angelo, built for Hadrian, was later converted into a fortress. [...] Compared to the Etruscans, though, there was less emphasis on provision of a lifestyle for the deceased, although paintings of useful objects or pleasant activities, like hunting, are seen. [...] Ancestor portraits, usually {{in the form of}} wax masks, were kept in the home, apparently often in little cupboards, although grand patrician families kept theirs on display in the atrium. [...] They were worn in the funeral processions of members of the family by persons wearing appropriate costume for the figure represented, as described by Pliny the Elder and Polybius. [...] Pliny also describes the custom of having a bust-portrait of an ancestor painted on a round bronze shield (clipeus), and having <b>it</b> <b>hung</b> in a temple or other public place. [...] No examples of either type have survived.|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} year, Rix Nicholas created {{one of her}} most {{extraordinary}} works, which would also be her largest canvas. Standing almost [...] high, and [...] wide, Les fleurs dédaignées ('The despised flowers') is an [...] "unnerving" [...] and [...] "arresting" [...] portrait of a young woman in fashionable eighteenth-century clothing. Painted not with the artist's typical technique, but in a mannerist style, the subject faces the viewer yet is glancing away, her pose tense, expression unreadable, with a bunch of discarded flowers on the ground next to the hem of her enormous formal dress. Although portraying a young lady, the person chosen to sit was [...] "a Parisian professional model and a prostitute, apparently with a reputation for being moody and cantankerous". The pastiche created in this work is striking: a sixteenth-century artistic style, a composition comprising a seventeenth-century tapestry and an eighteenth-century dress, created by a twentieth-century artist. It certainly reflected the scope of Rix Nicholas's abilities and ambitions, and was painted with the specific intention of having <b>it</b> <b>hung</b> at the Paris Salon. When the work was displayed in Sydney in 1927, it grabbed The Sydney Morning Herald critic's attention: ...|$|E
