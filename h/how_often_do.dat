500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ken Keeler, who had been {{watching}} a lot of Frasier {{at the time and}} had been assigned to write a Sideshow Bob episode and {{he thought it would be}} a good idea to mix the two. Pierce was cast as Sideshow Bob's brother, causing Pierce to joke, [...] "Normally, I would not do something like this. But <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>do</b> you get a chance to work with an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?" [...] While Sideshow Bob is addressing the crowd, a man near the back raises his hand and says [...] "probably"; he is also voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who had wanted to be a man in a crowd.|$|E
500|$|The episode [...] "Brother from Another Series" [...] {{introduces}} Bob's brother Cecil. After writer Ken Keeler {{was assigned}} to write an episode featuring Sideshow Bob, he drew inspiration from episodes of Frasier. He decided to incorporate elements of Grammer's other show into the character of Sideshow Bob, and designed Cecil to resemble Grammer's brother on Frasier. Cecil is voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who portrayed Frasier Crane's brother Niles. Pierce commented, [...] "Normally, I would not do something like this. But <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>do</b> {{you get a chance}} to work with an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?" [...] Several of Frasier producers were asked to review the original script and provide feedback. Their comments were positive; they only expressed concern with a very brief scene in which Cecil talks to a visible character whom he refers to as [...] "Maris". In Frasier, Maris Crane is an unseen character, and the producers of Frasier asked that the scene be removed. Many of the interactions between Bob and Cecil were based on those of Niles and Frasier. Cecil was drawn to resemble David Hyde Pierce, while retaining a visual similarity to Sideshow Bob. According to director Pete Michels, it was difficult to draw Bob and Cecil standing together, because of their comically oversized feet.|$|E
