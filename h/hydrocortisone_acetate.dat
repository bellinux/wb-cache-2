40|$|Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is {{the main}} cause of humoral hypercalcaemia of {{malignancy}} (HHM). We recently established a new human breast cancer cell line, designated KPL- 3 C, from the malignant effusion of a breast cancer patient with HHM. Morphological, cytogenetic and immunohistochemical analyses indicated that the cell line is derived from human breast cancer. The KPL- 3 C cells stably secrete immunoreactive PTHrP measured by a two-site immunoradiometric assay, possess both oestrogen and progesterone receptors and are tumorigenic in female nude mice. The addition of phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate to the medium significantly increased PTHrP secretion from the cells. In contrast, <b>hydrocortisone,</b> medroxyprogesterone <b>acetate</b> and 22 -oxacalcitriol decreased PTHrP secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, a number of microcalcifications were observed in the transplanted tumours. Radiographical examination indicated that the microcalcifications in the tumours are very similar to those commonly observed in human breast cancer. These findings suggest that this KPL- 3 C cell line may be useful for studying the regulatory mechanisms of PTHrP secretion and the mechanisms that lead to the deposition of microcalcifications in breast cancer...|$|R

The in-fluence of bilateral adrenalectomy on {{the synthesis of}} norepinephrine (NE) in the rat heart was determined by three independent methods 6 to 9 days after the operation. Two of the methods involved estimating turnover rates by: 1) measuring the decline of cardiac NE after inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase with a-methyl-p-tyrosine (cz-MPT) and 2) measur-ing the decline in specific activity of H’-NE in the heart after its i. v. administration. The third method involved measuring the amount of C 14 -NE formed in the heart after the i. v. administration of C 14 -tyrosine. Results obtained from all three methods showed {{a significant increase in}} the synthesis rate of NE in hearts from adrenalectomized rats over that obtained in normal or sham-operated animals. <b>Hydrocortisone,</b> desoxycorticosterone <b>acetate</b> and hex-amethonium all prevented the accelerated synthesis rate.

40|$|Chronic {{exposure}} to increased glucocorticoid concentrations appears {{to lower the}} threshold for hippocampal neuronal degeneration in the old rat. It has been proposed that increased brain {{exposure to}} glucocorticoids may lower the threshold for hippocampal neuronal degeneration in human aging and Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we asked whether chronic administration of high-dose cortisol to older nonhuman primates decreases hippocampal neuronal number as assessed by unbiased stereological counting methodology. Sixteen Macaca nemestrina (pigtailed macaques) from 18 to 29 years of age were age-, sex-, and weight-matched into pairs and randomized to receive either high-dose oral <b>hydrocortisone</b> (cortisol) <b>acetate</b> (4 – 6 mg/kg/d) or placebo in twice daily palatable treats for 12 months. Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal activity was monitored by measuring plasma adrenocorticotropin and cortisol, 24 hr urinary cortisol, and CSF cortisol. Urinary, plasma, and CSF cortisol were elevated, and plasma adrenocorticotropin was reduced in the active treatment group. Total hippocampal volume, subfield volumes, subfield neuronal density, and subfield total neuronal number did not differ between the experimental groups. These findings suggest that chronically elevated cortisol concentrations, {{in the absence of}} stress, do not produce hippocampal neuronal loss in nonhuman primates. ...|$|R
40|$|Involucrin {{accumulation}} and ionophore-assisted envelope for mation, {{markers of}} keratinocyte differentiation, {{were found to}} be highly dependent on culture conditions in the malignant epidermal keratinocyte line, SCC- 13, derived from a human squamous cell carcinoma. In confluent cultures, approximately one-half of the cells were competent to form envelopes when grown in medium without <b>hydrocortisone</b> or retinyl <b>acetate</b> supplementation. Ad dition of hydrocortisone to the medium during growth resulted in up to 90 % competence, while addition of retinyl acetate instead resulted in as low as 10 % competence. Hydrocortisone partially antagonized the effect of retinyl acetate when both agents were added together. Involucrin levels, measured by radioimmunoassay, were modulated essentially in parallel with envelope com petence under the various conditions tested. When the cells were grown in medium supplemented with hydrocortisone, the levels shortly after confluence were over 50 -fold higher than in sparse cultures. Regardless of <b>hydrocortisone</b> or retinyl <b>acetate</b> addition, less than 1 % of the cells were competent in sparse cultures of growing cells, but up to 90 % exhibited this property after growth arrest in serum-free medium containing hydrocortisone. High levels of competence were correlated with cessation of cell division but not with loss of colony-forming efficiency; under optimal conditions, two-thirds of the cells were capable of both envelope formation and colony initiation. Normal human epidermal cells showed a 4 - to 5 -fold increase in envelope competence from sparse to confluent culture but were insensitive to the suppressive effect of retinyl acetate.

We report a 4 -year-old boy with X-linked AHC with GKD. He presented a generalized hyperpigmentation at birth and was admitted to our hospital at the age of 0 day because of convulsion attacks. Laboratory finding on admission revealed marked hypoglycemia (0 mg/dl), mild metabolic acidosis and normal electrolytes.

40|$|A {{new method}} of analysis, based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, was {{developed}} for the simultaneous determination of twelve steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in cow milk. This analytical method was validated according to the European Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC. Analytes were separated by ion-suppression reversed-phase liquid chromatography, due to weakly acidic nature of the selected cortisonics. Dexamethasone tetradeuterated was chosen as internal standard. Detection was in positive ion mode, using a high flow electrospray interface (TurboIonSpray). Two Multi Reaction Monitoring (MRM) transitions each analyte were selected. Analytes’ recovery in milk {{was made up of}} two steps: 1) sample deproteinization by trifluoroacetic acid; 2) solid phase extraction (SPE) by means of C 18 as adsorbent and methanol as eluent. Recoveries were ≥ 70 % with relative standard deviations minor than 10 %. Matrix effect has become unimportant owing to the efficacy of the extraction procedure in interfering substances removal and to a suitable internal standard. In order to evaluate matrix effect, calibration curves in solvent were compared with calibration curves obtained by blank extracts spiked with analytes. Method limits were evaluated on the quantifier transition (less intense), according to the European Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC for decision limit (CCalfa) and detection capability (CCbeta) assessment.

This study was undertaken to compare 0. 03 % and 0. 1 % tacrolimus ointment with 1 % <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>acetate</b> ointment in children 2 to 15 years of age with moderate-to-severe AD. Treatment was twice daily to affected areas for 3 weeks in this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study.

40|$|Objective 11 ?-hydroxysteroid {{dehydrogenase}} type 1 (11 ?HSD 1) converts inactive cortisone {{to active}} cortisol. 11 ?HSD 1 activity is increased in GH deficiency and inhibited by GH and IGF-I in acromegaly. However {{it is not}} known whether these changes in cortisol metabolism exert significant effects during hydrocortisone therapy, and the effect has not been studied in patients taking cortisone acetate. We have studied the effect of GH induced 11 ?HSD 1 inhibition in hypopituitary adults with severe GH deficiency to determine whether this inhibition has a different magnitude of effect when patients are taking different forms of glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Design, patients and measurements We have taken the ratio of 11 -hydroxy/ 11 -oxo cortisol metabolites (Fm/Em), an established measure of net 11 ?HSD activity to reflect the likely balance of cortisol to cortisone exposure in tissues expressing 11 ?HSD 1, principally the liver and adipose tissue. We recruited 10 hypopituitary adults all on established glucocorticoid replacement therapy, but who were not receiving GH. Patients were treated with their standard hydrocortisone therapy for one week and an equivalent dose of cortisone acetate in its place for one week in random order. Serial serum cortisol assessments and urine steroid profiles were performed on each treatment. All patients were then established on GH therapy for at least three months before the two-week cycle was repeated. Fm/Em was also measured in a control population (20 F, 20 M). Results Prior to GH, the ratio Fm/Em was greater with hydrocortisone compared with cortisone acetate replacement (1 · 17 ± 0 · 28 and 0 · 52 ± 0 · 09 respectively, P < 0 · 001) or with normal subjects (normal males: 0 · 81 ± 0 · 24, females 0 · 66 ± 0 · 14). Following GH replacement Fm/Em fell in patients on <b>hydrocortisone</b> and cortisone <b>acetate</b> (Pre-GH: 0 · 84 ± 0 · 40, Post-GH: 0 · 70 ± 0 · 34, P < 0 · 05) confirming the inhibition of 11 ?HSD 1 by GH/IGF-I. Conversely, the ratio of urinary free cortisol/cortisone did not change indicating unchanged 11 ?HSD 2 activity. Mean circulating cortisol also fell in all subjects after GH. This effect was greater during cortisone acetate treatment (? 18 · 7 %, P < 0 · 0001), than during hydrocortisone replacement (? 10 · 9 %, P < 0 · 05). Conclusions Our data suggest that tissue exposure to glucocorticoid is supra-physiological in hypopituitary patients with untreated GH deficiency taking hydrocortisone replacement therapy. This situation is ameliorated by GH replacement therapy. However, local and circulating cortisol concentrations are more vulnerable to the inhibitory effect of GH on 11 ?HSD 1 in patients taking cortisone acetate, such that serum cortisol assessments should be made in patients taking cortisone acetate after GH therapy to ensure that glucocorticoid replacement remains adequate...|$|R

Initiation of treatment that can safely and effectively manage pruritus may provide immediate benefits to the patient. A novel topical formulation of <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>acetate</b> 2. 5 % and pramoxine hydrochloride 1 % in a hydrophilic lotion base is indicated for the management of pruritus. However, the rate of onset of antipruritic effects has not been well studied. This single-center, open-label, pilot study involved 11 subjects age 18 and older. All subjects applied <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>acetate</b> 2. 5 % and pramoxine hydrochloride 1 % lotion four times daily for one day. Severity of itch as measured by the visual analog scale decreased significantly following one day of medication use. The change in mean visual analog scale from baseline was - 2. 16 ± 2. 78 (P= 0. 0275), representing a mean percentage reduction of 31. 74 ± 42. 11 (P= 0. 0315). Topical application of <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>acetate</b> 2. 5 % and pramoxine hydrochloride 1 % lotion provides a significant reduction in pruritus as rated by patients using the visual analog scale with a single day of use. Early onset of action to decrease itch is expected to improve the patient's treatment experience and increase the level of long-term adherence...|$|E
40|$|Relative potencies of {{different}} topical steroids in two serial concentrations were evaluated over the flexor aspect of human forearm in 50 volunteers. The {{results indicated that}} the order of potency for different steroid solutions ranged from the lowest with <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>acetate</b> to the highest with betamethasone dipropionate while other steroids occupied intermediate positions. Further, it was noted that the potency of steroids is enhanced significantly by increasing their concentration...|$|E
40|$|Methyl {{prednisolone}} acetate and <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>acetate</b> {{were compared}} {{in a trial}} using the Hypospray to treat tennis elbow. There was little {{difference between the two}} preparations as far as side-effects and short-term suppression of symptoms were concerned, both being successful. However, late recurrence was very common in both groups, suggesting that a reappraisal of local steroid in this condition is needed. TENNIS elbow (lateral epicondylitis) is a common and troublesome complaint. Local steroid injections are the usual treatment and the Hypospray injector {{has been shown to be}} an effective method of delivering the steroid preparation (Hughes and Currey, 1969). The aim of this trial was to compare the effects of two commonly used prepara-tions, <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>acetate</b> and methyl prednisolone acetate, when used in the Hypospray to treat tennis elbow. Forty-six patients attending the Injection Clinic of the Rheumatology Department of the London Hospital, were admitted to a double-blind controlled trial. Four of the patients had bilateral tennis elbows, making a total of fifty elbows. Patients were excluded if there was any evidence of an underlying inflammatory arthropathy, or i...|$|E
40|$|BALB/c mice, immunized against babesia rodhaini by an {{amicarbalide}} controlled infection, {{were exposed}} to selective immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids and anti-thymocyte serum (ATS) respectively. <b>Hydrocortisone</b> <b>acetate,</b> 100 mg/kg, given i. p. six times during the three weeks after challenge inoculation caused a rising parasitaemia and high mortality (6 / 7). Dexamethasone in the drinking water at 20 mg/l or 10 mg/l for 22 days had a similar suppressive effect on the protection against babesia rodhaini. Mortality, 100...|$|E
40|$|The serum {{concentration}} of all subclasses of IgG (γ 2 A, γ 2 B, and γ 1) {{as well as}} IgA and IgM were reduced in normal and low pathogen mice receiving <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>acetate.</b> Turnover studies using 131 I-labeled γ 2 A subclass of IgG demonstrated that high dose corticosteroids cause a significantly shortened survival (increased catabolic rate) which contributes to the observed hypogammaglobulinemia. This increase in fractional catabolism is not due to excess loss in the urine or stool but reflects an increase in endogenous catabolism...|$|E
40|$|A 17 -day-old female {{child was}} {{referred}} {{for the evaluation}} of skin lesions on the scalp. She was born with cesarean section due to labor arrest. The lesions had started on the fronto-parietal region as small papules on an erythematous base on the tenth postnatal day and progressed in size and number in a week. A unilateral moderate conjunctivitis accompanied the skin lesions. Topical <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>acetate</b> 0. 5 % had been given upon a presumed diagnosis of eczema by a physician five days before admission. The medical family history was not remarkable...|$|E
40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to modify the Sayers method for the assay of corticotrophin by substituting for {{hypophysectomy}} an injection of sufficient <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>acetate</b> to suppress the release of endogenous pituitary corticotrophin in intact rats over the period of the assay. The results of forty such assays of subcutaneous corticotrophin seem to indicate that this procedure is about 1 ½ to 2 times as efficient as the original method using hypophysectomized rats. For a 2 + 2 point assay it was necessary to use a minimum of twenty-four to thirty-two rats...|$|E
