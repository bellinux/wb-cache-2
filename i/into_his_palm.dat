60|$|Her fingers {{clutched}} his, {{her nails}} dug <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm,</b> {{but he did}} not flinch.|$|E
6000|$|... "Produce your paper, gents," [...] {{continued}} Sanford, with {{a dramatic}} whang of a leathern wallet down <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm.</b> [...] "I'm buying up all paper on the bank." ...|$|E
50|$|Like {{the years}} before, Enaje had four-inch nails {{hammered}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>palms</b> and was {{hung on a}} cross for several minutes by local villagers dressed as Roman centurions.|$|R
60|$|Maxwell let <b>his</b> hand fall <b>into</b> <b>his</b> comrade's <b>palm</b> {{as though}} to {{convince}} him.|$|R
60|$|The man struck <b>his</b> fist <b>into</b> <b>his</b> left <b>palm,</b> {{and looked}} round the circle for opinions.|$|R
60|$|Wetting {{his thin}} lips with his tongue, Achmet Zek {{loosened}} the tie strings which closed {{the mouth of}} the pouch, and cupping one claw-like hand poured forth a portion of the contents <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm.</b>|$|E
60|$|The lawyer {{searched his}} {{trousers}} pockets, {{and produced a}} couple of pink notes and a few half-crowns. In some mysterious fashion, the whole seemed to pass into the Marquis's long, aristocratic hand. He turned to the porter who was standing bare-headed, and slipped a ten-shilling note <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm.</b>|$|E
60|$|Something {{small and}} soft slid gratefully <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm,</b> {{and there was}} silence for a space. Bill said nothing. Elizabeth said nothing. And Mr Pickering had stopped {{treading}} on twigs. The faintest of night breezes ruffled the tree-tops above them. The moonbeams filtered through the branches. He held her hand tightly.|$|E
60|$|Never a word said Sir Oliver, but he set {{his teeth}} and clenched his hands until the nails cut <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>palms.</b> Then he put an arm about this lad he loved above all save one in the whole world, and with anguish in his mind he {{supported}} him forward to the fire. There Lionel dropped to the chair that Sir Oliver had lately occupied.|$|R
60|$|Saying this Haco dashed {{the ashes}} {{out of his}} big German pipe <b>into</b> <b>his</b> left <b>palm,</b> and {{scattered}} them to the winds.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, God {{confound}} you, Mr. Lockwood! I {{wish you}} were at the--' commenced my host, setting the candle on a chair, because he {{found it impossible to}} hold it steady. 'And who showed you up into this room?' he continued, crushing <b>his</b> nails <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>palms,</b> and grinding <b>his</b> teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions. 'Who was it? I've a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Vervain gave {{a little}} sob as Don Ippolito {{took her hand and}} kissed it; and she had some {{difficulty}} in leaving with him the rouleau, which she tried artfully to press <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm.</b> [...] "Good-by, good-by," [...] she said, [...] "don't drop it," [...] and attempted to close his fingers over it.|$|E
6000|$|I {{drew out}} my purse; a meagre thing it was. [...] "Five shillings, sir." [...] He took the purse, poured the hoard <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm,</b> and chuckled over {{it as if}} its scantiness amused him. Soon he {{produced}} his pocket-book: [...] "Here," [...] said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but fifteen. I told him I had no change.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Fentolin shivered for a moment. Hamel, as {{he handed}} her to her place, {{was struck by a}} strange look which she threw upon him, half furtive, full of pain. Her hand almost clung to his. She slipped a little, and he held her tightly. Then he was {{suddenly}} conscious that something hard was being pressed <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm.</b> He drew his hand away at once.|$|E
60|$|She put {{her hand}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> offered <b>palm,</b> {{lowering}} her head, dark with bronze glints, upon which her father's hand rested for a moment.|$|R
60|$|He drove <b>his</b> right fist <b>into</b> <b>his</b> left <b>palm</b> and stamped {{out into}} the road. Lawyer Quince and Mr. Hogg, after a moment's hesitation, followed.|$|R
6000|$|... “Never mind, we’ll {{go after}} ’em anyway,” replied Gus. “And if we catch ’em——” He did not finish in words but brought his right fist down hard <b>into</b> <b>his</b> left <b>palm,</b> which {{left no doubt}} as to how he {{intended}} to treat the thieves.|$|R
6000|$|He grasped Demorest's {{hand and}} then dropped the little packet <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm,</b> and ambled away towards Stacy and Barker. Holding the packet in his hand with an amused yet puzzled smile, Demorest watched the gambler give Stacy's hand a hearty {{farewell}} shake and a supplementary slap on the back to the delighted Barker, and then vanish {{in a flash of}} red sash and silver buttons. At which Demorest, walking slowly towards his partners, opened the packet, and stood suddenly still. It contained the dried and bloodless second finger of a human hand cut off at the first joint! ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{no doubt}} it was the truth. Those eyes {{did not seem to}} be in the habit of lying. After all, the {{medicine}} could not hurt him. His nurse was at a little distance gazing absently at the sea. I sat down on a bench, and dropped a few of the pellets <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm.</b> He ate them seriously, and then turned around and backed--after the well-known appealing fashion of childhood--against my knees. I understood the movement--although it was unlike my idea of Johnnyboy. However, I raised him to my lap--with the sensation of lifting a dozen lace-edged handkerchiefs, and with very little more effort--where he sat silently for a moment, with his sandals crossed pensively before him.|$|E
6000|$|Next day, I did one {{of those}} funny things you do when you're feeling blue and lonely and {{a long way away}} from everybody. I called at your club and asked for you! Such a nice old man in uniform at the desk said in a fatherly way that you hadn't been in lately, and he rather fancied you were out of town, but would I take a seat while he inquired. He then summoned a tiny boy, also in uniform, and the child skipped off chanting, [...] "Mister Kemp! Mister Kemp!" [...] in a shrill treble. It gave me such an odd feeling to hear your name echoing in the distance. I felt so ashamed for giving them all that trouble; and when the boy came back I slipped twopence <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm,</b> which I suppose was against all the rules, though he seemed to like it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, you see, comrades," [...] said Captain Dall, {{thrusting}} <b>his</b> right fist <b>into</b> <b>his</b> left <b>palm,</b> [...] "the only trouble is, that he's not goin' direct home--got {{to visit}} the coast of South America and San Francisco first, an' {{that will make it}} a long voyage." ...|$|R
60|$|Tarzan untied the thong {{which held}} {{the mouth of}} the leathern bag closed, and {{permitted}} the contents to trickle slowly forth <b>into</b> <b>his</b> open <b>palm.</b> Mugambi's eyes went wide at the sight, and the others uttered exclamations of surprise and incredulity, for from the rusty and weatherworn pouch ran a stream of brilliant, scintillating gems.|$|R
6000|$|MR. ROBERTS (reaching {{his left}} hand toward THE PORTER'S, and {{pressing}} a half dollar <b>into</b> <b>his</b> instantly responsive <b>palm).</b> But there's nothing to prevent my looking if I feel perfectly sure of the bonnet? ...|$|R
60|$|He hailed another hansom, {{and drove}} off, still on fire, to his lawyer's in Victoria Street. On the way, {{he had to}} go near Paddington Station. He didn't observe, as he did so, a four-wheel cab that passed him with luggage on top, from Ivybridge to London. It was the Trevennacks, just {{returned}} from their holiday on Dartmoor. But Michael Trevennack had seen him; and his brow grew suddenly dark. He pinched his nails <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm</b> at sight of that hateful creature, though not a sound escaped him; for Cleer was in the carriage, and the man was Eustace's friend. Trevennack accepted Eustace perforce, after that night on Michael's Crag; for he knew it was politic; and indeed, he liked the young man himself well enough--there was nothing against him after all, beyond his friendship with Tyrrel; but {{had it not been for}} the need for avoiding scandal after the adventure on the rock, he would never have allowed Cleer to speak one word to any friend or acquaintance of her brother's murderer.|$|E
60|$|The farmer having (as I suppose {{by their}} talk) {{received}} such {{an account of}} me as his servant could give him, took {{a piece of a}} small straw, {{about the size of a}} walking-staff, and therewith lifted up the lappets of my coat; which it seems he thought to be some kind of covering that nature had given me. He blew my hairs aside to take a better view of my face. He called his hinds about him, and asked them, as I afterwards learned, whether they had ever seen in the fields any little creature that resembled me. He then placed me softly on the ground upon all fours, but I got immediately up, and walked slowly backward and forward, to let those people see I had no intent to run away. They all sat down in a circle about me, the better to observe my motions. I pulled off my hat, and made a low bow towards the farmer. I fell on my knees, and lifted up my hands and eyes, and spoke several words as loud as I could: I took a purse of gold out of my pocket, and humbly presented it to him. He received it on the palm of his hand, then applied it close to his eye to see what it was, and afterwards turned it several times with the point of a pin (which he took out of his sleeve,) but could make nothing of it. Whereupon I made a sign that he should place his hand on the ground. I then took the purse, and, opening it, poured all the gold <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm.</b> There were six Spanish pieces of four pistoles each, beside twenty or thirty smaller coins. I saw him wet the tip of his little finger upon his tongue, and take up one of my largest pieces, and then another; but he seemed to be wholly ignorant what they were. He made me a sign to put them again into my purse, and the purse again into my pocket, which, after offering it to him several times, I thought it best to do.|$|E
6000|$|He {{had no time}} to reply, for his servant {{had arrived}} with one of the {{dispensers}} of fortune; but as he turned away he wondered, {{in the light of the}} child's preference, about the towns of the interior. He was naturally exempt from the common doom. The officer who took him in hand, and who had a large straw hat and a diamond breastpin, was quite a man of the world, and in reply to the Count's formal declarations only said, [...] "Well, I guess it's all right; I guess I'll just pass you," [...] distributing chalk-marks as if they had been so many love-pats. The servant had done some superfluous unlocking and unbuckling, and while he closed the pieces the officer stood there wiping his forehead and conversing with Vogelstein. [...] "First visit to our country, sir?--quite alone--no ladies? Of course the ladies are what we're most after." [...] It was in this manner he expressed himself, while the young diplomatist wondered what he was waiting for and whether he ought to slip something <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm.</b> But this representative of order left our friend only a moment in suspense; he presently turned away with the remark quite paternally uttered, that he hoped the Count would make quite a stay; upon which the young man saw how wrong he should have been to offer a tip. It was simply the American manner, which had a finish of its own after all. Vogelstein's servant had secured a porter with a truck, and he was about to leave the place when he saw Pandora Day dart out of the crowd and address herself with much eagerness to the functionary who had just liberated him. She had an open letter in her hand which she gave him to read and over which he cast his eyes, thoughtfully stroking his beard. Then she led him away to where her parents sat on their luggage. Count Otto sent off his servant with the porter and followed Pandora, to whom he really wished to address a word of farewell. The last thing they had said to each other on the ship was that they should meet again on shore. It seemed improbable however that the meeting would occur anywhere but just here on the dock; inasmuch as Pandora was decidedly not in society, where Vogelstein would be of course, and as, if Utica--he had her sharp little sister's word for it--was worse than what was about him there, he'd be hanged if he'd go to Utica. He overtook Pandora quickly; she was in the act of introducing the representative of order to her parents, quite in the same manner in which she had introduced the Captain of the ship. Mr. and Mrs. Day got up and shook hands with him and they evidently all prepared to have a little talk. [...] "I should like to introduce you to my brother and sister," [...] he heard the girl say, and he saw her look about for these appendages. He caught her eye as she did so, and advanced with his hand outstretched, reflecting the while that evidently the Americans, whom he had always heard described as silent and practical, rejoiced to extravagance in the social graces. They dawdled and chattered like so many Neapolitans.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your knife," [...] said Tarzan to the girl, {{extending}} his hand. She slipped the hilt {{of the weapon}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> waiting <b>palm.</b> As <b>his</b> fingers closed upon it he drew her back and pushed her behind him. [...] "Walk back to the desert as rapidly as you can. If you hear me call you will know that all is well, and you may return." ...|$|R
60|$|As von Horn {{spoke the}} {{expression}} on the young man's face {{became more and more}} hopeless, and when he had ceased he dropped <b>his</b> head <b>into</b> <b>his</b> open <b>palms,</b> sitting quiet and motionless as a carven statue. No sob shook his great frame, there was no outward indication of the terrible grief that racked him inwardly--only in the pose was utter dejection and hopelessness.|$|R
5000|$|Review {{from the}} New York TimesA blog called The Damp Review figures {{prominently}} in Nick Laird's new novel. On it David Pinner, once an art student, now {{a teacher who}} dabbles in cultural criticism, writes about [...] "whatever took his fancy. Or didn't," [...] Mr. Laird writes. [...] "He {{found it easier to}} write on disappointments. Hatreds, easier still." [...] At the beginning of the book David goes to an art opening for Ruth Marks, a feminist American artist who is in London on a yearlong residency. Ruth was once David's teacher, and they strike up a friendship. But Ruth strikes up more with David's much-younger roommate, James Glover, who plays the innocent to David's cynic. And, as the romance between Ruth and James develops, so does David's anger and unhappiness. Mr. Laird is also a poet, a day job he reveals in sentences like [...] "David realized he'd been unconsciously pushing <b>his</b> nails <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>palms,</b> leaving little red falciform marks." ...|$|R

50|$|Eragon, a {{farm boy}} {{living in the}} country of Alagaësia with his uncle, is hunting for food when he comes across the stone. Hoping to trade it for food, Eragon brings the stone home, and finds a blue dragon {{hatching}} from it. As he touches the dragon, a magical mark is burned <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm.</b> A few people are shown reacting to this incident, including Arya, an old man named Brom, and Galbatorix himself.|$|E
60|$|The {{half-breed}} here {{referred to}} a habit of the hunters, who carry several bullets in their mouths to facilitate loading while running at full speed. The method is simple. The hunter merely pours powder <b>into</b> <b>his</b> left <b>palm,</b> transfers it to his gun, drops a bullet from <b>his</b> mouth <b>into</b> the muzzle, hits the butt smartly on his pommel, which at once sends the charge home and forces priming into the pan, and thus is ready for another shot.|$|R
60|$|It was {{something}} to {{have a bit of}} gold in one's possession {{for the first time in}} one's life; and David felt as if he had grown an inch taller, and were as good as six years old, as he walked away with the half sovereign squeezed <b>into</b> <b>his</b> hot little <b>palm.</b>|$|R
