40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{compliance with}} {{international human rights}} law in United Nations (UN) operations. It focuses on the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance, and on the assumption of administrative powers by the UN both de Jure (international administrations of territory) and <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> (<b>refugee</b> camps). It is argued that in these operations the UN has the functional capacity to have {{a direct impact on}} individuals and on the enjoyment of their fundamental rights. In part using case studies (the provision of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, the UN administrations in Kosovo and East Timor, and refugee camps in Kenya), it is shown that acts in violation of human rights have indeed been committed in the course of these operations. Although the UN is not itself a party to human rights treaties, various arguments are made to justify the applicability of international human rights law to the UN, and to its specialised programmes and agencies. Mechanisms - political, administrative, judicial and semi-judicial - for ensuring the accountability of the UN for violations of human rights are examined. However, existing mechanisms are largely inadequate. They neither offer remedies to the victims of the violations, nor impose sanctions on the perpetrators; their ability to modify future institutional conduct is also limited...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{critical}} inquiry {{into the history of}} Australia’s Special Humanitarian Program (1980), and the implications of the development of the Special Humanitarian Program (SHP) for Australia’s offshore refugee policy. This thesis investigates why the SHP was created, how the SHP was developed, and its historical significance for Australian refugee policy. The SHP was conceived in 1980 as a policy solution to facilitate the entry and resettlement of Jews from the Soviet Union. It was expanded into a Global SHP program in 1981 for all minorities overseas who were escaping human rights abuses in their home countries and had a connection to Australia. Critically, the SHP was for people in humanitarian need who were not classified as refugees under international law for technical legal reasons. They were de facto refugees: refugees in fact and circumstances but not in legal status. This thesis argues that the SHP was a substantial addition to and expansion of Australia’s offshore refugee policy and of Australia’s protection of de facto refugees. This thesis will show that the SHP was a concept of humanitarian entry that was substantially similar to Australia’s refugee entry even though the SHP formally appeared to have different processing requirements to the refugee program. Australia was not and is not legally obliged to admit into Australia refugees who are overseas, and moreover is not bound to admit people overseas who are de facto refugees. Australia did so and acted above its legal obligations, this thesis explains, largely in response to diplomatic pressures on handling Soviet Jewish migration and interdependence with US policy. Australia also was influenced by a strong ideological imperative on international human rights that galvanised in the 1970 s; human rights discourses drove Australia to act consistently with international rights to freedom of movement and to protection. This thesis makes a related argument that international human rights generated compelling duties and obligations on Australia, through political pressure, to admit refugees and de facto refugees and create responsive entry policies. The SHP is an area of Australian refugee policy that has not received scholarly attention in either legal or historical disciplines. Moreover, there is no detailed history of the development of SHP as the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>refugee</b> component of Australia’s overseas humanitarian intake. This thesis addresses a gap in legal scholarship on the development of Australian refugee law and policy, and in historical scholarship on immigration and refugee policy. It also extends knowledge on Soviet Jewish immigration in the field of Australian Jewish history. The thesis is informed by legal examination of international law and practice with respect to refugees. The thesis is primarily based on archival research in the Australian government archives. It also utilises Hansard parliamentary debates, Jewish organisational papers, US Presidential and organisational archives from New York, Australian and US newspapers, Australian demographic data, and some interviews.

40|$|U nlocking Human Dignity: A Plan to Transform the US Immigrant Detention System {{addresses}} one of {{the most}} troubled features of the US immigration system and highlights the need for fundamental changes to it. The report comes six years since the inception of the Obama administration’s detention reform initiative. In the interim, the number of immigrant detainees per year has risen to more than 400, 000, the administration has opened immense new family detention centers, and the overwhelming majority of persons in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have remained in prisons, jails and other secure facilities where they are subject to standards designed for criminal defendants and, in many ways, treated more harshly than criminals. The report’s overarching recommendation is that the US immigrant detention system be dismantled and replaced with a network of supervised release, case management, and community support programs, designed to ensure court appearances. It recognizes that detention may be necessary for short periods and in certain cases, but it rejects detention as a central immigrant “management” tool, and argues that detention should only be used as a last resort if less harmful strategies and programs—viewed on a continuum beginning with the least restrictive and moving to release programs with different levels of supervision, monitoring, and support—cannot reasonably ensure court appearances or (in rare cases) protect the public. It opposes the detention of pregnant and nursing women, bona fide asylum seekers, the very ill, the disabled, the elderly, and other vulnerable persons. It calls for the substantial contraction of detention facilities and “bed space. ” As the first step in this process, the report urges Congress to commission a comprehensive study on the benefits, challenges, cost, and time frame for creating a civil immigration detention system. It also proposes that the administration create a full menu of court compliance programs, with varying degrees of supervision, reporting, oversight and monitoring. In order to realize this vision, it offers several additional recommendations. T he Obama administration should desist from using detention as a “deterrent” to illegal migration and <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>refugee</b> flows. DHS should close its family detention centers in favor of community-based supervision and support programs for immigrant families. The vast majority of families would appear for removal proceedings with appropriate orientation, supervision and community support. The growth of an immense family detention infrastructure will not (as intended) deter imperiled persons from seeking refuge in the United States, but will invariably lead to the return of de facto refugees to their persecutors in violation of international law. C ongress should pass legislation to repeal mandatory detention in all but the most egregious criminal and national security cases. US mandatory detention laws cover lawful permanent residents, asylum seekers, petty offenders, and persons with US families and other enduring ties to the United States. By definition, they prevent individualized release determinations based on family ties, employment, housing, criminal history, and other factors. In the overwhelming majority of cases, immigration judges or judicial officers should be permitted to consider the full range of equities and release options for persons in removal proceedings, whether formal court proceedings or non-court, administrative and summary processes. P r ivate corporations should have a more limited, regulated and modest role in a shrinking detention system. The federal government has increasingly ceded responsibility for detention to entities whose loyalties run to their shareholders, not the common good. By some estimates, for-profit prison corporations administer more than 60 percent of the “beds” in the US immigrant detention system. Rather than expanding its reliance on for-profit prison companies, the federal government ought to decrease the use of detention, develop greater government expertise, and strengthen oversight of private contractors. D etention reform should include a significant expansion of Alternative to Detention programs (ATD). Detention should only be used sparingly, for brief periods (when necessary), and as a last resort when less restrictive strategies cannot reasonably ensure appearances during the adjudication and removal process and cannot protect the public. ATD programs can offer effective, humane alternatives to detention. However, they should not be used to expand detention capacity. Like detention, intensive reporting and monitoring programs can stigmatize and incapacitate persons. If necessary, ATD programs should be treated as a form of custody, which would open them to mandatory detainees. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should undertake a comprehensive analysis of its information systems. The proposed review should identify the information ICE tracks on those who are subject to its custody; how, when, and which officials collect, enter, and can access this information; its quality control procedures; and the accessibility of information to congressional oversight committees, government watchdog agencies, relevant ICE officials, and the public. D etained immigrants—those who do not qualify for release or ATD programs—should be held in non-penal settings which reflect the conditions of normal life to the extent feasible. DHS should provide generous access to international organizations, faith-based groups, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the press, to all of its facilities. Immigration judges should adjudicate removal cases now handled through administrative, informal and non-court processes, and should make release and custody determinations soon after their detention for all persons in DHS custody. They should also regularly revisit custody decisions for detainees. However, these responsibilities—added to an immense yearly workload and a daunting backlog of more than 440, 000 cases—will require increases in funding and staffing by an order of magnitude. As it stands, the immigration court system receives less than two percent of the combined funding of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and ICE. The cost of “right-sizing” the immigration court system may well be offset by reductions in DHS detention funding and diminished federal court expenses from habeas corpus petitions. U nrepresented, indigent persons in removal proceedings should be provided with legal representation at the government’s expense. As numerous studies have revealed, legal counsel is {{one of the}} most important factors, even more important than the strength of the underlying legal claim, in influencing asylum and other case outcomes. Representation also increases court appearance rates and leads to decreased overall costs to the government due to reduced use of detention, more efficient court proceedings, and less frequent placement of the children of detainees in foster care. More importantly, it contributes to the right decisions being made under the law. Migration and Refugee Services of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops (MRS/USCCB) and the Center for Migration Studies (CMS) approach the detention of immigrants from a pastoral perspective. Each day US Catholic institutions minister to detained immigrants, represent them in removal proceedings, tend to the material and spiritual needs of their families, and witness the pain of traumatized children and the anguish of divided families. Because of the detention system’s devastating effect on the lives of millions of persons each year, MRS/USCCB and CMS strongly support the transformation of this system and urge the Obama administration and Congress to proceed with the proposed reforms with all deliberate haste.  </p...|$|E

40|$|The legal {{relevance}} of the “urban refugee” concept in the Middle East and Africa stems from the practice of practicing different forms of refugee status determination (RSD) in rural as opposed to urban areas. Urban refugees are usually subject to rigorous individual adjudication, while rural refugees are typically recognized on a prima facie basis. This difference in procedure has no basis in the substance of refugee law, and it marginalizes urban refugees in two key ways. First, in Africa and the Middle East, refugee status recognition is used by host governments to prevent refugee integration, to force refugees to live far from population centres, and to transfer responsibility for their welfare to international agencies. Second, individualized RSD procedures in wide use by the United Nations generally lack key fairness safeguards, increasing the risk that genuine refugees will be wrongfully rejected. This phenomenon means that urban refugee populations will often be systematically undercounted, and will include {{a significant number of}} <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>refugees</b> who are in fact refugees in danger of refoulement, but whose applications were rejected and who thus have no access to the protection and resources otherwise targeted at refugees...|$|R

In particular, the literature has fallen short in explaining the behaviour of Iraqi Kurdistan. In order to better understand the behaviour of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states, this thesis asks the following questions: what are the factors that shape and influence <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state preferences and behaviour? What are the factors that determine if a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state will declare independence or preserve the status quo?

The goal of this dissertation is to identify the conditions under which a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state may declare independence and when it may preserve the status quo. To address these questions, this thesis employs international relations theories and adopts a comparative analysis method to the behaviour of Kosovo, South Sudan, and Iraqi Kurdistan. Following extensive fieldwork in Iraqi Kurdistan, the thesis argues that <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states will forgo independence when the parent state furnishes the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state with autonomy and offers sufficient economic incentives. Other mitigating factors include the domestic environment of the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state and the parent state, the role of regional and international governments, and the presence or absence of the old regime of the parent state.

The {{end of the}} Cold War {{has given}} rise to the number of non-state political actors such as <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states. While scholarly attention has been given to the concept of sovereignty and to empirical analyses of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> statehood, <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states as influential non-state political actors remained theoretically under-studied. This dissertation tackles the research question of how an issue that <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states causes affects the likelihood of conflict between a parent and an external state. I examine the “opportunity and willingness” pre-theoretical framework of Most and Starr (1989) in order to comprehend how <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states cause inter-state military conflict. I argue that the process of fighting for <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> statehood and the outcome of becoming a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state both create opportunity for the parent and external states. Moreover, internal dynamics in a state are important to understand whether the states are willing to exploit the interaction opportunity <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states generate. I especially examine regime type and levels of democracy in parent, external and <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states and argue that when these are all democracies, v likelihood of militarized disputes decrease. Using the comparative method and most similar systems design, I analyze two cases: Kurdistan Regional Government, Iraq, Turkey and South Ossetia, Georgia, Russia.
