5|$|In 1153 the Jin emperor Wanyan Liang {{moved the}} empire's capital from Huining Prefecture in {{northern}} Manchuria (south of present-day Harbin) to Zhongdu (now Beijing). Four {{years later in}} 1157 he razed Beijing, including the nobles’ residences, and moved the Jin's southern capital from Beijing to Kaifeng. It was here at the former seat of the Song dynasty that he began a large project of reconstruction (since the siege against it in 1127). For much of his reign there was peace between Jin and Song, while both states upheld an uninterrupted flow of commercial trade between each other. While amassing tribute <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> Song, the Jin dynasty also imported large amounts of tea, rice, sugar, and books <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> Song. However, Wanyan Liang reopened the Jin dynasty's armed conflict with the Song by the 1160s.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, the New York State Legislature created Route43, an {{unsigned}} legislative route extending <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> village line of Stillwater to {{the western}} village line of Schuylerville via the hamlet of Quaker Springs. On March 1, 1921, Route43 was renumbered to Route44 to eliminate numerical duplication with another legislative Route43 in western New York. At the same time, Route44 was extended southwest from Stillwater to Clifton Park via Mechanicville and west from Schuylerville to Saratoga Springs.|$|E

5|$|Known {{from several}} well-preserved skulls and {{abundant}} skeletal material, Majungasaurus has recently {{become one of}} the best-studied theropod dinosaurs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> Hemisphere.

Majungasaurus was the apex predator in its ecosystem, mainly preying on sauropods like Rapetosaurus, and {{is also one of the}} few dinosaurs for which there is direct evidence of cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all other}} large whales, the fin whale was heavily hunted during the 20th century {{and is an}} {{endangered}} species.

Recovery of the overall population size of southern species is predicted to be at less than 50% of its pre-whaling state by 2100 due to heavier impacts of whaling and slower recovery rates.|$|E
