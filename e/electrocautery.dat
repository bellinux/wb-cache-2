25|$|<b>Electrocautery</b> is {{available}} {{as an alternative}} to laser cautery. <b>Electrocautery</b> is a procedure that uses a light electrical current to burn moles, skin tags, and warts off the skin. Electric currents are set to a level such that they only reach the outermost layers of the skin, thus reducing the problem of scarring. Approximately 1-3 treatments may be needed to completely remove a mole. Typically, a local anesthetic is applied to the treated skin area before beginning the mole removal procedure.|$|E
25|$|For {{the past}} 50 years at least, {{tonsillectomy}} has been performed by dissecting the tonsil from its surrounding fascia, a so-called 'total', or extra-capsular tonsillectomy. Problems including pain and bleeding {{led to a}} recent resurgence in interest in sub-total tonsillectomy or 'tonsillotomy' which was popular 60–100 years ago, {{in an effort to}} reduce these complications. The generally accepted procedure for 'total' tonsillectomy uses a scalpel and blunt dissection or <b>electrocautery,</b> although harmonic scalpels or lasers have also been used. Bleeding is stopped with <b>electrocautery,</b> ligation by sutures, and the topical use of thrombin, a protein that induces blood clotting.|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{complications}} of SEMS {{may be related}} to the underlying tumour being treated: the tumour may grow into the stent wall (tumour ingrowth) or over the end of the stent (tumour overgrowth), leading to obstruction. These complications may be limited by the use of coated stents. Tumour ingrowth or overgrowth can be additionally palliated by the placement of a second stent through the lumen of the first, through <b>electrocautery</b> or argon plasma coagulation of the tumour tissue in the stent, or through the use of photodynamic therapy.|$|E
25|$|If a melanocytic nevus is {{suspected}} of being a melanoma, {{it needs to be}} sampled or removed and sent for microscopic evaluation by a pathologist by a method called skin biopsy. One can do a complete excisional skin biopsy or a punch skin biopsy, depending on the size and location of the original nevus. Other reasons for removal may be cosmetic, or because a raised mole interferes with daily life (e.g. shaving). Removal can be by excisional biopsy or by shaving. A shaved site leaves a red mark on the site which returns to the patient’s usual skin color in about two weeks. However, there might still be a risk of spread of the melanoma, so the methods of Melanoma diagnosis, including excisional biopsy, are still recommended even in these instances. Additionally, moles can be removed by laser, surgery or <b>electrocautery.</b>|$|E
25|$|In June 1940, a German {{prisoner}} of war was overheard boasting that the British would never find the Knickebein, {{even though it was}} under their noses. The details of the conversation were passed to an RAF Air Staff technical advisor, Dr. R. V. Jones, who started a search which discovered that Luftwaffe Lorenz receivers were more than blind-landing devices. Jones began a search for German beams; Avro Ansons of the Beam Approach Training Development Unit (BATDU) were flown up and down Britain fitted with a 30MHz receiver. Soon a beam was traced to Derby (which had been mentioned in Luftwaffe transmissions). The first jamming operations were carried out using requisitioned hospital <b>electrocautery</b> machines. The counter-operations were carried out by British Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) units under Wing Commander Edward Addison, No. 80 Wing RAF. The production of false radio navigation signals by re-transmitting the originals became known as Meaconing using masking beacons (meacons). Up to nine special transmitters directed their signals at the beams in a manner that subtly widened its path, making it harder for bomber crews to locate targets and confidence in the device was diminished by the time the Luftwaffe was ready to conduct big raids.|$|E
25|$|Different implant {{manufacturers}} require {{slightly different}} instrumentation and technique. No consensus has emerged over {{which one is}} the best. Clinical studies {{are very difficult to}} perform, requiring large numbers of cases followed over many years. The most significant variations are between cemented and uncemented components and between resurfacing the patella or not. Among those who do not resurface the patella, there is also variation between denervating the patella using <b>electrocautery</b> or not. In theory, this technique could disrupt the superficial pain receptors near the patella in hopes of relieving anterior knee pain, a common post-operative complaint. No consensus exists, but a recent randomized controlled trial indicates that while both methods provide relief, patellar denervation results in a modest benefit compared to no denervation in the short-term. The patient satisfaction was higher with more number of patients rating the procedure as excellent in the denervation group (74.6% vs 50.8%). The benefit does not, however, persist mid- to long-term post-operatively. Anterior knee pain component within the patellar score and Visual Analogue Scale for anterior knee pain were significantly better in the denervation group at 3 months (4.5 vs 5.1) but not at 12 months (4.4 vs 4.9) and 24 months (2.1 vs. 2.2).|$|E

Aren't you?'," [...] followed by more laughter.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{surgery is}} not {{commonly}} performed, the polycystic ovaries {{can be treated}} with a laparoscopic procedure called [...] "ovarian drilling" [...] (puncture of 4–10 small follicles with <b>electrocautery,</b> laser, or biopsy needles), which often results in either resumption of spontaneous ovulations or ovulations after adjuvant treatment with clomiphene or FSH. (Ovarian wedge resection is no longer used as much due to complications such as adhesions {{and the presence of}} frequently effective medications.) There are, however, concerns about the long-term effects of ovarian drilling on ovarian function.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two most}} common eye issues that Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs face are distichiasis and entropion, with distichiasis {{being the most}} common issue. Distichiasis is the {{presence}} of extra eyelashes along the eyelid. Distichiasis has been reported in 19%, of the breed and {{in the vast majority of}} cases it is non-symptomatic and does not cause an issue for the dog. Extra eyelashes can be seen along the eyelid; sometimes extra eyelashes grow so that they irritate the eye. [...] Treatment varies from vet to vet, some choosing to freeze the affected hair follicles and others choosing to use <b>electrocautery.</b>|$|E

50|$|Burns from <b>electrocautery</b> {{generally}} {{arise from}} a faulty grounding pad or from {{an outbreak of}} a fire. Monopolar <b>electrocautery</b> works because radio frequency energy is concentrated by the surgical instrument's small surface area. The electrical circuit is completed by passing current through the patient's body to a conductive pad that is connectd to the radio frequency generator. Because the pad's surface area is large relative to the instrument's tip, energy density across the pad is reliably low enough that no tissue injury occurs at the pad site. Electrical shocks and burns are possible, however, if the circuit is interrupted or energy is concentrated in some way. This can happen if the pad surface in contact is small, e.g. if the pad's electrolytic gel is dry, if the pad becomes disconnected from the radio frequency generator, or via a metal implant. Modern <b>electrocautery</b> systems are equipped with sensors to detect high resistance in the circuit that can prevent some injuries.|$|E
50|$|POEM {{is a form}} {{of natural}} orifice translumenal {{endoscopic}} surgery, or NOTES. Like the traditional surgical myotomy, the procedure is performed under general endotracheal anesthesia. The remainder of the procedure is performed using a flexible endoscope inserted through the mouth, and no cuts are made on the chest or abdomen. Occasionally, an “overtube” is inserted to facilitate repeated removal & insertion of the endoscope. First, a submucosal injection of dyed saline creates a cushion, then a cut is made in the esophageal mucosa using <b>electrocautery</b> roughly 13 centimeters before the lower esophageal sphincter. Then, using hydrostatic dissection and <b>electrocautery,</b> the submucosal tunnel is made. Once the circular fibers of the lower esophageal sphincter are encountered, they are divided using <b>electrocautery</b> all the way down onto {{the first part of the}} stomach. This functionally weakens the sphincter, allowing improved passage of food and liquid into the stomach. Finally, the submucosal flap is closed using clips or sutures also placed through the endoscope.|$|E

50|$|The main {{forms of}} {{cauterization}} used {{today in the}} first world are <b>electrocautery</b> and chemical cautery—both are, for example, prevalent in the removal of unsightly warts. Cautery can also mean the branding of a human, either recreational or forced.|$|E
50|$|Flat warts usually {{dissipate}} {{on their}} own after 1 to 2 months as the infection has subsided. But if the warts cause significant displeasure typical wart removal methods {{can be applied to}} them including: liquid nitrogen, <b>electrocautery,</b> and laser resurfacing.|$|E
50|$|Small lesions can {{be treated}} with light <b>electrocautery.</b> Larger lesions {{can be treated}} with electrodesiccation and curettage, shave excision, or cryosurgery. When {{correctly}} performed, removal of seborrheic keratoses will not cause much visible scarring except in persons with dark skin tones.|$|E
50|$|Bipolar <b>electrocautery</b> {{passes the}} current between two tips of a forceps-like tool. It has the {{advantage}} of not disturbing other electrical body rhythms (such as the heart) and also coagulates tissue by pressure. Lateral thermal injury is greater in unipolar than bipolar devices.|$|E
50|$|Electrocauterization is {{preferable}} to chemical cauterization, because chemicals can leach into neighbouring tissue and cauterize outside of intended boundaries. Concern has also been raised regarding toxicity of the surgical smoke <b>electrocautery</b> produces. This contains chemicals that, through inhalation, may harm patients or medical staff.|$|E
5000|$|A shave biopsy is {{done with}} either a small scalpel blade or a curved razor blade. The {{technique}} is very much user skill dependent, as some surgeons can remove a small fragment of skin with minimal blemish using {{any one of the}} above tools, while others have great difficulty securing the devices. Ideally, the razor will shave only a small fragment of protruding tumor and leave the skin relatively flat after the procedure. Hemostasis is obtained using light <b>electrocautery,</b> Monsel's solution, or aluminum chloride. This is the ideal method of diagnosis for basal cell cancer. It can be used to diagnose squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma-in-situ, however, the doctor's understanding of the growth of these last two cancers should be considered before one uses the shave method. The punch or incisional method is better for the latter two cancers as a false negative is less likely to occur (i.e. calling a squamous cell cancer an actinic keratosis or keratinous debris). Hemostasis for the shave technique can be difficult if one relies on <b>electrocautery</b> alone. A small [...] "shave" [...] biopsy often ends up being a large burn defect when the surgeon tries to control the bleeding with <b>electrocautery</b> alone. Pressure dressing or chemical astringent can help in hemostasis in patients taking anticoagulants.|$|E
