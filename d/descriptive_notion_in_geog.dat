It is proved that the name «anti-terrorist operation» does not correspond {{to the content of}} political phenomenon marked with this term. The main attention is paid to an individual second name of denotate «occupational regime in some districts of Donetsk and Lugansk regions», its formal and grammar organizations, lexical and semantic fillers within the constituent positions, possible izofunctional relations at the level of form and content, its connotative meaning. Also, based on the linguistic and extra linguistic criteria, denotative and connotative meaning, the semantic classification of periphrastic expressions was given. The author analyses the semantic models of the word-marker war and derived components with the following reference features such as «ideological intention», «driving force», «goal», «place», «local conflict», «illegitimacy», «time», «place in the history of interrelated events», compound models of <b>descriptive</b> <b>notions.</b> <b>In</b> general, the author shows the difference between general linguistic and individual, military and nonmilitary periphrases and states the co-referential interactions among them and their origin...|$|R
40|$|The notion ‘preverb’ is a {{traditional}} <b>descriptive</b> <b>notion</b> <b>in</b> Indo-European linguistics. It refers to morphemes that appear {{in front of a}} verb, and which form a close semantic unit with that verb. In many cases, the morpheme that functions as a preverb can also function without a preverbal context, often as an adverb or an adposition. Most linguists use the notion ‘preverb’ as a cover term for preverbal words and preverbal prefixes. The preverb may be separated from the verb whilst retaining its close cohesion with the verb, which is called ‘tmesis’. It may also develop into a bound morpheme, that is, a prefix inseparable from the verb, with concomitant reduction of phonological form in some cases. If the preverb has become a real prefix, we may use the more specific notion of ‘complex verb’, whereas we take the notion ‘complex predicate’ to refer generally to multi-morphemic expressions with verbal valency. That is, we make a terminological distinction between complex predicates and complex verbs. The latter are multi-morphemic, but behave as single grammatical words...|$|R

Besides, this paper also proposes a new algorithm for speaker independent continuous digit speech recognition based on the HDS point dynamic searching theory without end-points detection and segmentation. First from the different digit syllables in real continuous digit speech, we establish the covering area in feature space for continuous speech. During recognition, we make use of the point covering dynamic searching theory in HDS to do recognition, and then get the satisfying recognized results. At last, compared to HMM (Hidden Markov models) -based method, from the development trend of the comparing results, as sample amount increasing, the difference of recognition rate between two methods will decrease slowly, while sample amount approaching to be very large, two recognition rates all close to 100 % little by little. As seen from the results, the recognition rate of HDS point covering method is higher than that of in HMM (Hidden Markov models) based method, because, the point covering describes the morphological distribution for speech in HDS, whereas HMM-based method is only a probability distribution, whose accuracy is certainly inferior to point covering...|$|R

The agency currently provides no service to the Boulevard, although it does service neighboring areas, including I- 35 W and the Mall of America.

5000|$|Early {{research}} of bilingual lexical access was {{generated from the}} theories of unilingual lexical access. Theories derived from early unilingual research relied mainly upon generalizations without precise specification of how these specific systems of lexical access works. Due {{to the advancement of}} medical science within the last decade, the field of Psycholinguistics has evolved immensely, resulting in more detailed research and therefore, {{a deeper understanding of the}} mechanisms behind language production. [...] "Many early studies of second language acquisition focused on the morphosyntactic development of learners, and the general findings was that bound morphemes appear in the same order in the first and second language"(Bardovi-Harlig 1999. In addition, [...] "second language learners are also able to produce and process simple sentences before complex sentences" [...] (Pienemann et al.2005), just like first language learners. For example, the theory of serial search models and parallel access models. Serial Search Models propose that when monolinguals encounter a word, they will look through all the lexical entries to distinguish whether the input item is a word not, and then they will only retrieve the necessary information about that word (i.e., its semantics or orthography). They also propose that the lexical access would process sequentially by activating only one lexical entry at a time. In contrast, the Parallel Access Models believe that multiple entries can be activated at once, which means that the perceptual input from a word would activate all lexical items directly, even though some of them might not be necessary. In this way, numbers of potential candidates would be activated simultaneously and then the lexical candidates which are most consistent with the input stimulus would be chosen. Later, the researchers addressed that both the serial and parallel process are accounted for the lexical organization and lexical access.Knowledge of unilingual access has inevitably led to the curiosity of bilingual lexical access. Early models of bilingual lexical access shared similar characteristics with these unilingual lexical access models. For example, the bilingual models began with focusing on whether the lexical access for bilinguals would be different from monolinguals. In addition to study the activation process in separate language, they also investigated whether the lexical activation would be processed in a parallel fashion for both languages or selectively processed for the target language. In this case, the bilingual models also studied whether the bilingual system has a single lexicon combining words from both languages or separate lexicons for words in each language. With the occurrence of widespread computational modeling, researchers extended the theoretical approaches for the studies of bilingual lexical access.The computational models are now essential component for mainstream theories, for example, the models of Bilingual Interactive Activation BIA model, the Semantic, Orthographic and Phonological Interactive Activation SOPIA model, and the Bilingual interactive Model of Lexical Access BLMOLA. Since most computational models need to specify all the vague <b>descriptive</b> <b>notions</b> used <b>in</b> the earlier models, they force researchers to be more clarified with their theories. Those revised models can also serve as to test the viability of the original theories by comparing the empirical results with data generated from the model. In addition, the computational models can also help to generate new testable hypothesis and allow researchers to manipulate conditions which might not be possible in normal experimentation. For example, researchers can investigate and simulate the lexical access systems under various states of damage without using aphasic people.|$|R
40|$|International audienceReflective {{facilities}} in OO languages are used both for implementing language extensions (such as AOP frameworks) and for support-ing new programming tools and methodologies (such as object-centric debugging and message-based profiling).
