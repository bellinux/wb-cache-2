He appeared in The Guinness Book of Records for the longest sentence ever to appear in a newspaper – 1,667 words. He was proud of this, and affected to be outraged when [...] "some bugger in India wrote a sentence very considerably longer". He maintained that he could construct impromptu a sentence of up to 40 subordinate clauses [...] "and many a native of these islands, speaking English as to the manner born, has <b>followed</b> <b>me</b> trustingly into the labyrinth only to perish miserably {{trying to find the}} way out".|$|E

[...] "Olga and Tatiana had <b>followed</b> <b>me</b> back to the box and saw everything that happened", Tsar Nicholas II wrote to his mother, Dowager Empress Maria, on September 10, 1911. [...] "…It had made a great impression on Tatiana, who cried a lot, and they both slept badly." [...] Three years later, she saw gunshot wounds close up when she trained to become a Red Cross nurse. Olga, her sister Tatiana, and her mother Tsarina Alexandra treated wounded soldiers at a hospital on the grounds of Tsarskoye Selo.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} dogfight over England on 24 August 1940, Marseille was {{involved}} in a four-minute battle with a skilled opponent. He defeated his opponent by pulling up into a tight chandelle, to gain an altitude advantage before diving and firing. The British fighter was struck in the engine, pitching over and diving into the English Channel; this was Marseille's first victory. Marseille was then engaged from above by more Allied fighters. By pushing his aircraft into a steep dive then pulling up metres above the water, Marseille escaped from the machine gun fire of his opponents: [...] "skipping away over the waves, I made a clean break. No one <b>followed</b> <b>me</b> and I returned to Leeuwarden [...]" [...] The act was not praised by his unit. Marseille was reprimanded when it emerged he had abandoned his wingman, and staffel to engage the opponent alone. In so doing, Marseille had violated a basic rule of air combat. Marseille did not take any pleasure in this victory and found it difficult to accept the realities of aerial combat.|$|E

2500|$|D'Urban's troopers were {{surprised}} by Trelliard's division, which included the 13th, 18th, 19th and 22nd Dragoons, plus the Westphalian Chevau-légers and the Italian Napoleone Dragoons. The Portuguese horsemen were routed and three cannons were lost. A frustrated D'Urban wrote of his troopers, [...] "At Salamanca they <b>followed</b> <b>me</b> into the enemy's ranks like British dragoons; yesterday they were so far from doing their duty {{that in the first}} charge they just went far enough to land me in the enemy's ranks. In the second, which (having got them rallied) I rashly attempted, I could not get them within 20 yards of the enemy – they left me alone, and vanished before the French helmets like leaves before the autumn wind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Quicker than thought I {{brought my}} saber down {{with all my}} {{strength}} upon [...] head. He was moving as the blow fell, and I suppose I did not strike him where I intended, for he received a deep saber cut {{in the back of}} the neck. He fell senseless on his side, then rolled over on his back. He had in his hand a short Sharpe's cavalry carbine. I think he had just fired as I reached Colonel Washington, for the Marine who <b>followed</b> <b>me</b> into the aperture made by the ladder received a bullet in the abdomen, from which he died in a few minutes. The shot might have been fired by someone else in the insurgent party, but I think it was from Brown. Instinctively as Brown fell I gave him a saber thrust in the left breast. The sword I carried was a light uniform weapon, and, either not having a point or striking something hard in Brown's accouterments, did not penetrate. The blade bent double.|$|E
