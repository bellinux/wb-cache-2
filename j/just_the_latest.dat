5|$|The season premiered at the Pacific Design Center on January 26, 2017, {{ahead of}} its FX debut on February 8. It ran for eight episodes, until March 29. The season {{received}} critical acclaim for its cast, particularly Stevens; Hawley's visuals and design; and the nonlinear, unreliable nature of the storytelling. Several critics did note that the latter aspects would not be for all viewers, and some criticized this as <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> in a trend of series with unreliable narratives. Legion was renewed for a second season on March 15, 2017.|$|E

This incident was <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> provocation in a decades-long bad feeling between the two scientists. Gell-Mann often expressed frustration at the attention Feynman received; he remarked: [...] " [...] was a great scientist, but he {{spent a great deal of}} his effort generating anecdotes about himself." [...] He noted that Feynman's eccentricities included a refusal to brush his teeth, which he advised others not to do on national television, despite dentists showing him scientific studies that supported the practice.|$|E
500|$|The {{complications}} {{regarding the}} illegal firearms used in Timoshenko's murder inspired new laws passed in New York City, which authorized new penalties, touted as [...] "part {{of the toughest}} illegal gun possession law in the country." [...] A public awareness campaign, named [...] "GUNS=PRISON", featured posters {{calling attention to the}} 3 ½year prison sentence given to anyone caught carrying an illegal loaded handgun in New York. [...] At a press conference, Mayor Bloomberg stated, [...] "Police Officer Russell Timoshenko was <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> victim killed by a gunman firing at close range. [...] If the prospect of {{three and a half years}} in jail deters just one would-be killer from carrying a gun and taking the life of another police officer in another deadly confrontation, then the law and the efforts to publicize it are well worth it." [...] NFL player Plaxico Burress was charged with this new law due to an incident that occurred inside of a New York City nightclub. On August 20, 2009, Burress plead guilty to a gun possession charge and agreed to a two-year prison sentence.|$|E

40|$|The 'acceleration' of land-secured {{assessments}} allows municipalities {{to declare}} the entire value (not <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> payments) of a property owner's outstanding balance payable if a default occurs. State laws vary on whether acceleration is required, permitted, or prohibited. Acceleration can be attractive to bond investors because it strips out non-performing assessments, and may avoid delays in debt service payments to investors. The risk that non-acceleration will negatively impact bond investors is a particular issue in states without a process for rapidly resolving defaults. However, acceleration may also increase the risk to mortgage holders, as the full amount of the outstanding assessment becomes due and traditionally has priority over other lien holders. Acceleration also places a greater burden on the property owner...|$|R

2500|$|Michael Byers, a {{professor}} in Political Science at the University of British Columbia, questions the assumption {{that there is one}} definition of global citizenship, and unpacks aspects of potential definitions. In the introduction to his public lecture, the UBC Internalization website states, [...] "'Global citizenship' remains undefined. What, if anything, does it really mean? Is global citizenship <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> buzzword?" [...] Byers notes the existence of stateless persons, whom he remarks ought to be the primary candidates for global citizenship, yet continue to live without access to basic freedoms and citizenship rights. Byers does not oppose the concept of global citizenship, however he criticizes potential implications of the term depending on one's definition of it, such as ones that provide support for the [...] "ruthlessly capitalist economic system that now dominates the planet." [...] Byers states that global citizenship is a [...] "powerful term" [...] because [...] "people that invoke it do so to provoke and justify action," [...] and encourages the attendees of his lecture to re-appropriate it in order for its meaning to have a positive purpose, based on idealistic values.|$|E

2500|$|The opening {{match of}} the show was the {{technico}} team of Hombre Bala Jr. and Super Halcon Jr. face off against Bobby Zavala and Disturbio in a Tag Team match.

The Lightning Match saw the seasoned veteran Rudo Rey Bucanero cheat his way to a victory over Ángel de Oro with very little time left on the clock.

He had attempted a thousand remonstrances with himself; he had sought to remedy the defects in his own character by written inscriptions in his bedroom and memoranda inside his watch case.
