25|$|While {{on holiday}} in Burnham-on-Sea in 1937, Betty {{suffered}} an <b>insect</b> <b>bite</b> which became infected, {{and she died}} in her husband's arms from septicaemia following amputation of her leg. The loss devastated Montgomery, who was then serving as a brigadier, but he insisted on throwing himself back into his work immediately after the funeral. Montgomery's marriage had been extremely happy. Much of his correspondence with his wife was destroyed when his quarters at Portsmouth were bombed during the Second World War. After Montgomery's death, John Carver wrote {{that his mother had}} arguably done the country a favour by keeping his personal oddities – his extreme single-mindedness, and his intolerance of and suspicion of the motives of others – within reasonable bounds long enough for him to have a chance of attaining high command.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are four}} genetic {{disorders}} acknowledged {{by the industry}} that may affect horses of Friesian breeding: dwarfism, hydrocephalus, a tendency for aortic rupture, and mega-esophagus. [...] There are genetic tests {{for the first two}} conditions. [...] The Friesian is also among several breeds that may develop PSSM. [...] Approximately 0.25% of Friesians are affected by dwarfism, which results in horses with a normal-sized head, a broader chest than normal, an abnormally long back and very short limbs. It is a recessive condition. [...] Additionally, the breed has a higher-than-usual rate of digestive system disorders, and a greater tendency to have <b>insect</b> <b>bite</b> hypersensitivity. Like some other draught breeds, they are prone to a skin condition called Verrucous pastern dermatopathy and may be generally prone to having a compromised immune system. [...] Friesian mares have a very high 54% rate of retained placenta after foaling. Some normal-sized Friesians also have a propensity toward tendon and ligament laxity {{which may or may not}} be associated with dwarfism. [...] The relatively small gene pool and inbreeding are thought to be factors behind most of these disorders.|$|E
