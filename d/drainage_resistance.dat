40|$|Based on {{schematic}} {{representations of}} hydrogeological conditions, {{related to the}} structure of the formations and topographical features, analytical solutions were derived for the behaviour of groundwater discharge in terms of a time-variable <b>drainage</b> <b>resistance.</b> This led to a general equation of the <b>drainage</b> <b>resistance</b> as a function of groundwater discharge. This physically based equation was implemented in a simple non-distributed conceptual runoff model in order to analyse continuous time series of runoff with intermittent rainfall.

In the paper, the stray current intensity of the rebar in the ballast of the power supply area and the 24 -hour polarization potential of the rebar in the ballast are obtained through the test of vertical <b>resistance,</b> track-current <b>drainage</b> net <b>resistance</b> and track-earth resistance, and the polarization potential test in the tunnel ballast of metro system in service.

According to the relation of graph theory and gas drainage system, the gas drainage system of Zhao Gezhuang mine is optimized by graph theory and the resistances are calculated. After optimization, the <b>drainage</b> <b>resistance</b> is equally distributed, which increases the quantity of gas drainage from coal mine, improves the efficiency and reliability of mine gas drainage system and enhances {{the safety of the}} mine; so the firm foundation of the gas utilization is established and the virtuous cycle of “drainage-usage -safety production” and comprehensive gas control are well realized.

IOP can be reduced by up to 34. 7 %. It is known that the effect of IOP reduction is constant over time, unlike argon or selective laser trabeculoplasty. The procedure is also very safe. If required later, filtering surgery is not compromised because there is no conjunctival touch during ELT and therefore no scarring of the conjunctiva is induced.

40|$|Fractional {{differentiation}} has adequate use {{for investigating}} real world scenarios related to geological formations associated with elasticity, heterogeneity, viscoelasticity, {{and the memory}} effect. Since groundwater systems exist in these geological formations, modelling groundwater recharge as a real world scenario is a challenging task to do because existing recharge estimation methods are governed by linear equations which make use of constant field parameters. This is inadequate because in reality these parameters are a function of both space and time. This study therefore concentrates on modifying the recharge equation governing the EARTH model, by application of the Eton approach. Accordingly, this paper presents a modified equation which is non-linear, and accounts for parameters {{in a way that}} it is a function of both space and time. To be more specific, herein, recharge and <b>drainage</b> <b>resistance</b> which are parameters within the equation, became a function of both space and time. Additionally, the study entailed solving the non-linear equation using an iterative method as well as numerical solutions by means of the Crank-Nicolson scheme. The numerical solutions were used alongside the Riemann-Liouville, Caputo-Fabrizio, and Atangana-Baleanu derivatives, so that account was taken for elasticity, heterogeneity, viscoelasticity, and the memory effect.

40|$|Various {{analytical}} {{theories of}} consolidation for soils with vertical drains {{have been proposed}} in the past. Most conventional theories {{are based on a}} cylindrical unit cell that contains only a single vertical drain. This paper described a new analytical model where a vertical drain located at the centre (the 2 ̆ 7 inner vertical drain 2 ̆ 7) and is surrounded by two or three vertical drains (the 2 ̆ 7 outer vertical drains 2 ̆ 7), the number of which depends on whether the configuration is triangular or rectangular. Both types of drains are combined into a cylindrical unit cell, and the water is assumed to flow both inwards to the inner vertical drain and outwards to the outer vertical drains distributed around the circumference. The outer radial boundary of the unit cell is regarded as a permeable boundary, with a drainage capacity of two or three separate vertical drains for triangular and rectangular configurations, respectively. The smear effects and the <b>drainage</b> <b>resistances</b> for both the inner and outer vertical drains are considered in the analysis as well. In this way, the equations governing the consolidation process with multiple vertical drains are derived, and the corresponding analytical solutions are obtained for instantaneously loading, ramp loading and multi-stage of instantaneously loading and multi-stage of ramp loading. The present solutions are finally compared with several conventional solutions for a single vertical drain in the literature. The results show that the present model predicts the same average degree of consolidation as conventional models do, which verifies the correctness of this new model. Finally, the settlement predicted by the present solution is compared with the measured settlement from a field test at the Port of Brisbane, Australia, which shows a good agreement between them...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of xylan removal on characteristics of bleached birch kraft pulps and on the behavior of such modified pulps in a papermaking process, particularly from the chemical retention point of view. The two methods used to reduce the pulp xylan content to an intermediate level between paper-grade kraft pulps and dissolving pulps were alkaline extraction and enzymatic treatment with endo-xylanases. The resulting changes in pulp properties were evaluated and, for the xylanase-treated pulps, the changes in pulp filtrate properties were also monitored. The wet end retention behavior was studied in the presence of typical papermaking additives in both laboratory and pilot-scale environments, making it possible to assess the effects of applied pulp treatments on colloidal charge interactions taking place in the wet end section of a papermaking process. The effect of xylan removal on fiber characteristics depended on the pulp treatment applied. Alkaline extraction of dried pulp resulted in a 25 - 45 wt% reduction in the pulp xylan content together with altered fiber dimensions, increased water retention value (WRV), accessibility to high molecular weight (HMW) dye, and a lower total charge of the pulps, particularly of the fines fraction. The apparent surface charge of fines was lower in the alkali-extracted pulp than in the unextracted pulp but there were no differences in the surface charges of the corresponding long fiber fractions. The xylanase treatment of never-dried birch pulp reduced the pulp xylan content by up to 24 wt% depending on the xylanase dose and dosing strategy, resulting in pulps with slightly modified fiber dimensions, lower WRV and lower <b>drainage</b> <b>resistance.</b> In addition, the xylanase-treated pulps showed an increased accessibility for HMW dye together with ballooned fiber sections, confirming a loosened fiber wall structure. The negative zeta potential of the pulps obtained from streaming potential measurements decreased as a result of the xylanase treatment with the simultaneous release of negatively charged xylan-based substances into the pulp filtrates. The alkaline extraction increased the nanoscale surface roughness of fibers whereas the xylanase treatment had the opposite effect. The removal of xylan from dried pulp by alkaline extraction was found to be beneficial for the retention of filler, starch and alkyl ketene dimer (AKD), which was attributed in particular to the reduced charge content of fines. A similar behavior was observed with the xylanase-treated pulps after washing, i. e. in the absence of dissolved xylan-based residues, but the presence of large amounts of these residues interfered with the retention system and led to significant retention losses. Therefore, the obtained results emphasize the importance of re-evaluating the retention system and strategy when using pulps with a lower xylan content for papermaking...|$|E
40|$|In {{exploring}} groundwater quality {{patterns in}} sandy phreatic aquifers this thesis follows three fundamental tracks, which {{are of a}} methodological, of a conceptual, and of a process based kind. First, in chapter 1 the three principle factors that together determine the groundwater quality distribution, which are flow, input, and geochemical processes, are introduced. Also the two perspectives of relating groundwater flow to groundwater quality are presented. The first perspective {{is in terms of}} future and past pathways of point source pollution, the second is of a spatiotemporal type, where the water quality in streams, wells, or wetlands is related to the historical landuse within their recharge areas. These concepts form the framework for the following chapters. In chapter 2 groundwater flow is mapped in terms of the two mentioned perspectives. I show that some powerful 3 D aspects of groundwater flow models are underexplored, and that this is due to (1) the lack of adequate visualization methods, and (2) the incompleteness of existing definitions of groundwater flow systems. Both problems are resolved by formalizing groundwater flow systems analysis in three dimensions and by the development of new mapping techniques. This is illustrated for the Hengelo area. Some implications are elaborated upon, both in terms of groundwater flow system and model scale as well as from a conceptual and spatial planning viewpoint. However, such maps are of limited practical value when the uncertainty of groundwater flow is unknown. In chapter 3 it is shown that existing techniques for estimating uncertainty mainly focus on groundwater levels, whereas in relating groundwater quality to groundwater flow other characteristics of groundwater flow are important. A methodology was developed that assesses the uncertainty in groundwater flow system configuration, and is illustrated for the Salland area. The resulting maps of uncertainty due to anisotropy, <b>drainage</b> <b>resistance,</b> recharge, and drainage level are discussed. In chapter 4 the often used age-depth relation, as presented in chapter 1, is extended towards an exhaustive framework for groundwater quality patterns. The concept of hydrogeochemical streamtubes is introduced, by which water quality boundaries and changes in their location, as observed in the Salland multilevel well section, are related to flow, input, and processes. Observed patterns are shown to be better explained in this way, especially as the framework presented takes into account groundwater flow system size, position within the groundwater flow system, land use, and land use scale. In chapter 5 both the sources and controls of trace and major elements are explained using a sequential approach that addresses all known important controls and sources for all trace elements of adequate analytical quality. Advances were made by following two new approaches. First bulk geochemical soil data is used to better explain observed concentrations in terms of codissolution and coprecipitation, and secondly the SEQSSI-approach (sorption equilibrium through steady state input), which explains the behaviour and concentrations of a large set of trace elements is presented. The thesis concludes with a synthesis in which practical spin-off, in terms of background values, modelling, spatial planning, and monitoring, are further elaborated upon...|$|E
40|$|Montmorillonite (Mt) nanoclay is a layered {{silicate}} mineral with a 2 : 1 -type layer structure, two tetrahedrals sandwiching one octahedral. In recent decades, it is successfully {{introduced into}} polymer systems to form polymer-clay nanocomposites (PCN) {{in which the}} silicate layers of the Mt are randomly and homogeneously dispersed at a molecular level in the polymer matrix. Due to the addition of Mt, some properties of PCN, such as the mechanical, thermal and gas barrier properties, were superior to those of pristine polymers. Based on this idea, natural and organo Mts were used to modify bitumens with different penetration grades in this study. Some rheological, ageing and fatigue properties of the modified bitumens and mortars were characterized. High-shearing mixing method was used to prepare the modified bitumen; X-ray diffraction and micro-CT scanning were employed to observe structures of Mts in bitumen; DSR equipment was adopted to characterize the rheological properties; the rolling thin film oven (RTFO) and pressure ageing vessel (PAV) methods were used to simulate the short term and long term ageing on base and Mt modified bitumens, respectively. Fatigue tests were performed on bitumen and mortar samples which consisted of bitumen, filler and sand at a weight ratio of 0. 34 : 0. 30 : 0. 36, {{as well as on}} a dense graded asphalt mixture. XRD results indicated an intercalated structure of organo Mts in the bituminous matrix. A phase separated structure of natural Mt was found in the base bitumen. Micro-CT images further proved that natural Mt acted like a conventional filler at micrometer level. The interaction between the Mts layers and bitumen changed its viscosity and dynamic response as characterized by means of the DSR. Reinforced shear thinning was observed on the modified bitumens at a liquid state, which implies a better <b>drainage</b> <b>resistance</b> of asphalt mixture during transportation. The results indicated that organo Mts improve the short term ageing resistance of base bitumen. The main reason for this improvement is that the barrier properties of Mt particles hinder the penetration of oxygen. Meanwhile, the reduction of volatilization of the oil components of bitumen due to these barrier properties can be another reason. However, a less effective improvement was observed for the long term ageing using the PAV. That is because organo Mt platelets automatically accumulated to reduce their surface area under tough testing conditions in the PAV. This accumulation weakened the barrier properties of the Mts. It is believed however that organo Mts will improve the long term ageing behaviour of bitumen in the field because the state of the Mt will be very stable and no accumulation as occurred in the PAV will happen. The addition of organo Mts can change the fatigue properties of bitumen and even mortar. This change was influenced by the type of the surfactant on the Mt which determined the interfacial interaction between the bitumen and the Mt. Because of the heterogeneous character of asphalt mixtures and their complicated failure mechanism, the fatigue test on the asphalt mixture with the modified bitumen only gave a limited improvement of this property. Finally, some important aspects are given for further research. Based on the present research results, the organo Mt can be an alternative to modifiers used in the bitumen to sustain the durability of asphalt pavements.

40|$|A {{modelling}} {{approach was}} developed, {{incorporated in the}} finite-element method based program LGMLUC, {{making it possible to}} determine the reliability of travel times of groundwater flowing to groundwater abstraction sites. The reliability is seen here as a band (zone) around the expected travel-time isochrone, with the width of this probability occurrence zone (e. g. between 97. 5 and 2. 5 percentile values) increasing with increasing uncertainty in the model-input parameters. The modelling approach is based on the First-Order Second-Moment (FOSM) method for uncertainty propagation analysis. The FOSM results have been compared with a Monte Carlo analysis for an LGM model and another, LGM-independent model. From the match between FOSM and Monte Carlo results it was concluded that the FOSM approach is an adequate and computationally effective method to analyse the uncertainty of travel times. The travel time was assumed to be log-normally distributed. The uncertainty in several model-input parameters was accounted for as a factor influencing the reliability of travel times. These are aquifer transmissivity, hydraulic <b>resistance</b> of aquitards, <b>drainage</b> and infiltration <b>resistance</b> defining the head-flux relation between the top aquifer and surface waters, effective porosity of aquifers and aquitards, and groundwater recharge rate. All these model-input parameters are assumed to be log-normally distributed. The uncertainty in these parame-ters was derived using inverse-method calibration and expert judgement. The applicability of the modelling approach was demonstrated for a pilot study area in {{the central part of the}} Netherlands. The approach can be used for problems with various spatial resolutions of the finite-element grid, problems ranging from local (high grid density) to regional.

40|$|Cellular {{concrete}} is a {{cost effective}} construction {{material that is}} continuously gaining traction and popularity in the US and elsewhere. Cellular concrete is a material consisting of Portland cement, water, and foam. When it hardens, the concrete has an oven-dry density ranging from approximately 50 lbs/cubic feet to 90 lbs/cubic feet. Some applications have achieved an even lower density that 50 lbs/cubic feet. Recipes may also include aggregates such as fly ash. Admixtures are used as well depending on the final use of the product. Cellular concrete has numerous applications in the building construction industry and as an underground backfilling material, but lately other uses in the infrastructure field have been gaining popularity especially as a stabilizer around transmission conduits. Popular application of cellular concrete includes insulation, fire retarding, and sound proofing {{for a variety of}} structures. Cellular concrete systems provide better <b>drainage,</b> increased fire <b>resistance,</b> increased wind uplift ratings, improved seismic values, efficient thermal insulation, and improved sound attenuation in an environmentally friendly manner. In underground applications, cellular concrete is used as a cost effective filler material in lieu of soil without the compaction effort required when using soil. Most recently the infrastructure field introduced cellular concrete as a backfill and filler material around underground structures such as segmental tunnel liners and pipelines. Cellular concrete can be used as backfill material at pipeline fault crossing by allowing localized ground deformation without overstressing the pipe section. This application can minimize damage to the pipeline or tunnel transmission structure that results from a shear failure of the pipe. However, the low compressive strength of cellular concrete limits its application as a structural material.

40|$|Considerable work {{to date on}} orogenic {{systems has}} {{focussed}} on active orogens, whereas relatively little research has looked at inactive, post-orogenic systems. This study begins to redress this balance by considering the post-orogenic Pyrenean mountain belt. The relative importance of the controls of tectonics, lithology and climate on the resultant geomorphology of the post-orogenic system are considered, as well as quantifying the degree and timing of post-orogenic exhumation. This is achieved {{through the use of}} digital elevation data, field observations and low temperature thermochronology. Extraction of morphometric parameters from digital elevation data at a catchment scale reveals a north-south asymmetry within the Pyrenees, with northern catchments having steeper slopes and lower minimum elevations than their southern counterparts. This is attributed to an inherited tectonic control, with the original asymmetric form that was developed during active orogenesis being preserved through post-orogenic erosion. The distribution of erosion-resistant crystalline massifs within the Axial Zone of the Pyrenees provides a first order control on the position of the principal <b>drainage</b> divide. This <b>resistance</b> to erosion compared to the surrounding lithologies allows the massifs to define the high elevations within the chain. Climate has also played a role, with an enhanced glaciation on the northern side of the orogen brought about by orographic precipitation and reduced solar radiation. This has resulted in glaciation in northerly catchments reaching lower elevations than their southerly counterparts and permitting glaciers to extend further into the foreland in the north than those in the south during larger glaciations. Apatite fission track and apatite (U-Th) /He thermochronometers and associated thermal modelling document an asymmetry in the exhumation and erosional history of the Pyrenees. Results show that vertical profiles in northerly draining catchments record rapid exhumation at 30 Ma, with 1 km or less of exhumation after this time. In contrast, samples to the south of the main drainage divide, whilst also showing rapid exhumation at around 30 Ma, show considerably more exhumation after this time (2. 5 km). Therefore, these thermochronometers also document the transition from a syn- to a post-orogenic system recording a gradual, diachronous shutdown across the orogen. This evidence suggests that some isolated regions of the orogen remained active after 20 Ma and possibly as late as 10 Ma, considerably later than previously documented. No evidence is recorded for an acceleration in erosion related to climate change in the last 4 Ma. Modelling work has also highlighted the importance of evolving topography and the associated deformation of isotherms that influence thermochronometric analysis in mountainous terrain...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} called soil aggregate coalescence {{occurs at}} contact-points between aggregates and causes soil strength to increase to values that can inhibit plant root exploration and thus potential yield. During natural wetting and drying, soil aggregates appear to ‘weld’ together {{with little or}} no increase in dry bulk density. The precise reasons for this phenomenon are not understood, but it has been found to occur even in soils comprised entirely of water stable aggregates. Soil aggregate coalescence has not been widely observed and reported in soil science and yet may pose a significant risk for crops preventing them from achieving their genetic and environmental yield potentials. This project used soil penetrometer resistance and an indirect tensile-strength test to measure the early stages of aggregate coalescence and to evaluate their effects on the early growth of tomato plants. The early stages of aggregate coalescence were thought to be affected by a number of factors including: the matric suction of water during application and subsequent drainage, the overburden pressure on moist soil in the root zone, the initial size of soil aggregates prior to wetting, and the degree of sodicity of the soil aggregates. Seven mainexperiments were conducted to evaluate these factors. The matric suction during wetting of a seedbed affects the degree of aggregate slaking that occurs, and the strength of the wetted aggregates. The matric suction during draining affects the magnitude of ‘effective stresses’ that operate to retain soil structural integrity as the soil drains and dries out. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of matric suction (within a range of suctions experienced in the field) on aggregate coalescence using soils of two different textures. Sieved aggregates (0. 5 to 2 mm diameter) from a coarse-textured and two fine-textured (swelling) soils were packed into cylindrical rings (4. 77 cm i. d., 5 cm high) and subjected to different suctions on wetting (near-saturation, and 1 kPa), and on draining (10 kPa on sintered-glass funnels, and 100 kPa on ceramic pressure plates). After one-week of <b>drainage,</b> penetrometer <b>resistance</b> was measured as a function of depth to approximately 45 mm (penetrometer had a recessedshaft, cone diameter = 2 mm, advanced at a rate of 0. 3 mm/min). Tensile strength of other core-samples was measured after air-drying using an indirect “Brazilian” crushing test. For the coarse-textured soil, penetrometer resistance was significantly greater for samples wet to near-saturation, despite there being no significant increase in dry bulk density; {{this was not the case}} for the finer-textured soils, and it was difficult to distinguish the effects of variable bulk density upon drying from those of the imposed wetting treatments. In both coarse- and fine-textured soils, the tensile strength was significantly greater for samples wet to near-saturation. Thus wetting- and draining-suctions were both found to influence the degree of soil aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. Aggregate coalescence in irrigated crops is known to develop as the growing season progresses. It was therefore thought to be linked to the repeated occurrence of matric suctions that enhance the phenomenon during cycles of wetting and draining. An experiment was conducted to determine the extent of aggregate coalescence in a coarsetextured and two fine-textured (swelling clay) soils during 8 successive cycles of wetting and draining. Sieved aggregates (0. 5 to 2 mm diameter) from each soil were packed into cylindrical rings (4. 77 cm i. d., 5 cm high) and wetted to near saturation for 24 h. They were then drained on ceramic pressure plates to a suction of 100 kPa for one week, after which penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured as described above. The degree of expression of aggregate coalescence depended on soil type. For the coarse-textured soil, repeated wetting and draining significantly increased bulk density, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. For the fine-textured soil, penetrometer resistance and bulk density did not vary significantly with repeated wetting and draining; on the contrary, there was evidence in these swelling clay soils to suggest bulk density and penetrometer resistance decreased. However, there was a progressive increase in tensile strength as cycles of wetting and draining progressed. The expansive nature of the fine-textured soil appears to have masked the development of aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance, but its expression was very clear in measurements of tensile strength despite the reduction in bulk density with successive wetting and draining. Field observations have indicated that aggregate coalescence is first expressed at the bottom of the seedbed and that it develops progressively upward to the soil surface during the growing season. This suggests that overburden pressures may enhance the onset of the phenomenon by increasing the degree of inter-aggregate contact. Soils containing large quantities of particulate organic matter were known to resist the onset of aggregate coalescence to some extent. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of soil organic matter and overburden pressures, by placing brass cylinders of various weights (equivalent to static load pressures of 0, 0. 49, 1. 47 and 2. 47 kPa) on the top of dry soil aggregates (0. 5 – 2 mm diameter) having widely different soil organic carbon contents placed in steel rings 5 cm high and 5 cm i. d. With the weights in place, the aggregates were wetted to near-saturation for 24 h and then drained on ceramic pressure plates to a suction of 100 kPa for one week. Bulk density, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured when the samples were removed from the pressure plates and they all increased significantly with increasing overburden pressure in the soil with low organic matter content, but not in the soil with high organic matter content. The amount of tillage used to prepare seedbeds influences the size distribution of soil aggregates produced – that is, more tillage produces finer seedbeds. The size distribution of soil aggregates affects the number of inter-aggregate contact points and this was thought to influence the degree of aggregate coalescence that develops in a seedbed. Previous work has shown that soil organic matter reduces aggregate coalescence and so an experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of aggregate size and organic matter on the phenomenon. For soils with high and low organic matter contents, aggregate size fractions of < 0. 5, 0. 5 – 2, 2 – 4, and < 4 mm were packed into soil cores (as above) and wetted to near-saturation then drained to 100 kPa suction as described above. Penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured and found to increase directly with the amount of fine material present in the soil cores – being greater in the < 0. 5 mm and < 4 mm fractions, and being less in the 0. 5 – 2 mm and 2 – 4 mm fractions. In all cases, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were lower in the samples containing more organic matter. The rate at which soil aggregates are wetted in a seedbed affects the degree of slaking and densification that occurs, and the extent to which aggregates are wetted influences the overall strength of a seedbed. Both wetting rate and the extent of wetting were believed to influence the onset of aggregate coalescence and were thought to be affected by soil organic matter and irrigation technique. An experiment was therefore designed to separate these effects so that improvements to management could be evaluated for their greatest efficacy – that is, to determine whether management should focus on improving irrigation technique or increasing soil organic matter content, or both. The rate of wetting was controlled by spraying (or not spraying) soil aggregates (0. 5 – 2 mm diameter) with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Samples of coarse- and fine-textured soils were packed into steel rings (as above) and subjected to different application rates of water (1, 10 and 100 mm/h) using a dripper system controlled by a peristaltic pump. Samples were brought to either a near-saturated state or to a suction of 10 kPa for 24 h, and then drained on a pressure plate at a suction of 100 kPa for one week. Measurements of penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were then made as described above. As expected, penetrometer resistance was lower in samples treated with PVA before wetting (slower wetting rates) and in samples held at a greater suction (10 kPa) after initial wetting (greater inter-aggregate strength). The effects were more pronounced in the coarse-textured soil. In both coarse- and fine-textured soils, tensile strengths increased with increasing wetting rate (greatest for 100 mm/h) and extent of wetting (greater when held at near-saturated conditions). The rate of wetting was found to be somewhat more important for promoting aggregate coalescence than the extent of wetting. Because aggregate coalescence often occurs {{with little or no}} increase in bulk density, an explanation for the increase in penetrometer resistance and tensile strength is unlikely to be explained by a large increase in the number of inter-aggregate contacts. An increase in the strength of existing points of inter-aggregate contact was therefore considered in this work. For inter-aggregate bond strengths to increase, it was hypothesized that small increases in the amount of mechanically (or spontaneously) dispersed clay particles, and subsequent deposition at inter-aggregate contact points could increase aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. An experiment was devised to manipulate the amount of spontaneously dispersed clay in coarse- and fine-textured soils of high and low organic matter content. The degree of|$|R
