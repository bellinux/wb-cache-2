On 6 September 1946 United States Secretary of State, James F. Byrnes made the famous speech Restatement of Policy on Germany, also known as the Stuttgart speech, where he amongst other things repudiated the Morgenthau plan-influenced policies and gave the West Germans hope for the future.

Biographer Eve Golden described the reviews of Bara's acting as [...] "nothing less than vicious", but the commentary about the {{play as a}} whole was even more negative. Variety expected Bara to draw audiences to the theater for at least a few weeks, but said opinions in the daily press were united about <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>the</b> play was. In The New York Times, Alexander Woollcott mocked the dialogue, which included lines such as, [...] "Have you brought the cocaine?"

Woollcott highlighted one particular line: [...] "I'm going to be so bad, I'll be remembered always." [...] He said Bara was bad, but not bad enough to be memorable. He credited her for speaking clearly and for not losing her composure when the audience laughed at her. Other reviewers gave Bara similarly faint praise: she had [...] "average competence" [...] or [...] "was not so bad". Some complimented her looks or her glamorous wardrobe.|$|E

Ethel, aide Peter Edelman, Marian Wright Edelman (wife of Peter Edelman), and a small group of reporters, local officials, and parishioners closely followed. People joined the crowd as it walked, becoming so large that a group of National Guardsmen mistook it for a mob of looters. Fearing a confrontation, they put on their gas masks and fixed their bayonets.

In GamePro magazine, they criticized {{the fact that}} the Lynx's small screen makes it difficult for players to see the various power-ups and enemies and to use secondary weapons. However, they praised the good controls, and they said the sound was fine though [...] "weird and spacy". VideoGames & Computer Entertainment praised the game for being better than the arcade version that was previously ported to the Lynx, but they were disappointed that Tecmo did not port the first two NES Ninja Gaiden titles to the handheld, as well. Electronic Gaming Monthly praised Tecmo for a good translation of the game from the NES to the Lynx– complete with good graphics, controls, and varied gameplay– while saying that [...] "Ninja Gaiden [...] is a game that the Atari Lynx has been longing for". Despite that, the reviewers noted that the Lynx's small screen made all the sprites too small for most players to see well, and the screen's blurring makes it frustrating for players to track character movements. In a retrospective review, Allgame gave a mostly negative review, saying that the background makes it difficult to see foreground elements, that players cannot see their character or what power-ups they are collecting, and that sound is very poor, saying [...] "thirteen banshees all wailing different, off-key songs would only begin to approach just <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>the</b> music is".|$|E

In late April 2009, Biden's off-message response to a question during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak, that he would advise family members against travelling on airplanes or subways, led to a swift retraction from the White House. [...] The remark revived Biden's reputation for gaffes, and led to a spate of late-night television jokes themed on him being a loose-talking buffoon. [...] In the face of persistently rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had [...] "misread <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>the</b> economy was" [...] but maintained confidence that the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up. [...] The same month, Secretary of State Clinton quickly disavowed Biden's remarks disparaging Russia as a power, but despite any missteps, Biden still retained Obama's confidence and was increasingly influential within the administration. On March 23, 2010, a microphone picked up Biden telling the president that his signing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was [...] "a big fucking deal" [...] during live national news telecasts. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs replied via Twitter [...] "And yes Mr. Vice President, you're right..." [...] Senior Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett said that Biden's loose talk [...] " [...] part of what makes the vice president so endearing ... We wouldn't change him one bit." [...] Former Senate colleague Lindsey Graham said, [...] "If there were no gaffes, there'd be no Joe. He's someone you can't help but like."

He did however praise the artwork by Jim Lee, although he did say that the artwork just drew attention to <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>the</b> writing was.
