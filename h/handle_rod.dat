The site chosen was 300 yd from the gasworks on the Up side of the line. By the end of 1867 works were underway on two buildings adjacent to one another: one of eight roads (182 x 105 ft) and one of four roads (165 x 80 ft). In the south-west corner of the site was a 42 ft turntable which by 1899 was later relocated nearer the road bridge crossing {{the neck of the}} yard and extended to <b>handle</b> <b>ROD</b> 2-8-0s.

40|$|The {{reduction}} or {{elimination of}} leakage of hydraulic fluid from fluid power systems {{is considered a}} fundamental prerequisite for the expanded use of fluid power. There is also a need to reduce seal friction to both reduce energy dissipation and eliminate control problems. These seals are developed through empirical means at the present time, since the fundamental physics of seal operation has been unclear. This research develops numerical models for analyzing reciprocating hydraulic rod seals with various rod surfaces. These models consist of coupled fluid mechanics, contact mechanics and deformation analyses. Both flooded and starved lubrication boundary conditions are applied. For seals with a smooth rod and a plunge-ground rod, the model combines a 1 -D finite volume Reynolds equation solver with a 2 -D axisymmetric finite element deformation and static contact mechanics analyses, and a Greenwood-Williamson contact mechanics analysis with rod motion. Leakage and friction, along with sealing zone details with the plunge-ground rod are compared with those with the smooth rod. The influence of rod surface finish on seal performance is investigated and explained, under both flooded and starved conditions For seals with a micro-patterned rod, the model consists of finite volume Reynolds equation solver, finite element deformation and static contact mechanics analyses and a Greenwood-Williamson dynamic contact mechanics analysis. This model is able to <b>handle</b> <b>rod</b> surface pattern with 3 -dimensional geometrics. Simulations with different micro-pattern geometries are performed to analyze the fundamental mechanism of surface pattern effects on seal operation. Again, both flooded and starved conditions are applied and the results for both cases are compared and analyzed. Ph. D...|$|E

40|$|Floor-by-floor {{survey of}} {{installed}} elements of an elevator shaft using coordinate method and tacheometer is also inhibited by {{the necessity to}} determine device installation points for floors of every mounting horizon that leads to additional measurements due to conditions of the completed building framework and presence of {{a great number of}} situational disturbances and then it entails significant time expenditure and diminution of accuracy in the obtained results. Technical capabilities of the modern electronic tacheometer substantially simplify an accomplishment of the mission because the device can be applied not only in function of vertical projection but it can be used for preand post-construction survey of the elevator shaft with the help of advanced radiation method. While using the given method the electronic tacheometer equipped with diagonal ocular is installed over a bearing sign in the elevator pit and control points of the elevator shaft are determined with the help of specially developed portable beam deflector in the form of disc with radius   r, which is fixed to a <b>handle</b> <b>rod</b> and orientated perpendicularly to a laser beam. An innovation diagram for preand post-construction survey of elevator shaft has been developed while applying this type of deflector. The diagram is characterized by high efficiency {{due to the fact that}} one tacheometer installation makes it possible to execute highly accurate, complete plane and high-level surveying of the whole elevator shaft including doorways, door sills and jambs. The paper proposes a new method for pre and post construction survey of the elevator shaft using the electronic tacheometer while applying specially developed beam deflector that ensures a geometric fixing of one or simultaneously two surveying points to spatial coordinate system where the preand post-construction survey is carried out. The method is characterized by high geometric accuracy and technological efficiency. </p...|$|E

40|$|Proposed as a {{baseline}} configuration, this rotary drill apparatus {{is designed to}} produce 100 -mm diameter holes in the lunar surface at depths up to 50 meters. The drill is intended to acquire samples for scientific analysis, mineral resource location, calibration of electronic exploration devices, and foundation analysis at construction sites. It is also intended to prepare holes for emplacement of scientific instruments, the setting of structural anchors, and explosive methods in excavation and mining activities. Defined as a deep drill because of the modular drill string, it incorporates an automatic rod changer. The apparatus is teleoperated from a remote location, such as earth, utilizing supervisory control techniques. It is thus suitable for unmanned and man-tended operation. Proven terrestrial drilling technology is used to the extent it {{is compatible with the}} lunar environment. Augers and drive tubes form holes in the regolith and may be used to acquire loose samples. An inertial cutting removal system operates intermittently while rock core drilling is in progress. The apparatus is carried to the work site by a three-legged mobile platform which also provides a 2 -meter feed along the hole centerline, an off-hole movement of approximately. 5 meters, an angular alignment of up to 20 deg. from gravity vertical, and other dexterity required in <b>handling</b> <b>rods</b> and samples. The technology can also be applied using other carriers which incorporate similar motion capabilities.

2500|$|Once hooked, a small trout can {{be easily}} {{retrieved}} [...] "on the reel" [...] or by simply pulling in the fly line with the reel hand while pinching {{the line between the}} <b>rod</b> <b>handle</b> and the index finger of the rod hand. It is important to keep the rod tip high, allowing the bend of the rod to absorb the force of the fish's struggles against the line. Larger trout will often take line in powerful runs before they can be landed. Unlike spin fishing where the line is already on the reel, playing a large fish with fly line and a fly reel can present a special challenge. Usually, when a fish is hooked, there will be extra fly line coiled between the reel and the index finger of the rod hand. The challenge is to reel up the loose fly line onto the reel without breaking off a large fish (or getting the line wrapped up around the <b>rod</b> <b>handle,</b> one's foot, a stick or anything else in the way). With experience, really large trout can be put on the reel simply by applying light pressure on the outgoing line using the fisher's fingers. Once the extra line is on the reel, an angler can use the reel's drag system to tire the fish. It is important to use heavier tippet material if it won't spook the fish. The reason why this is important is an exhausted fish can easily die if released too soon. Heavier tippet material enables the angler to land the fish while not over exhausting it.|$|R

The friendship between himself and the Scotch terrier at his heels would have been easily explained by Lessing, for in the transmigration of souls the spirit of Harry Verney had evidently once animated a dog of that breed. He was dressed in a huge thick fustian jacket, scratched, stained, and patched, with bulging, greasy pockets; a cast of flies round a battered hat, riddled with shot-holes, a dog- whistle at his button-hole, and an old gun cut short over his arm, bespoke his business.|$|R
