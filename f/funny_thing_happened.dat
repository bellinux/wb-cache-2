After suffering a nervous breakdown {{at the start of the}} 1960s, he began to recover his old popularity, initially with a season at Peter Cook's satirical Establishment Club in Soho in London.

Other early Sondheim works include Anyone Can Whistle (1964, which ran only nine performances, despite having stars Lee Remick and Angela Lansbury), and the successful Company (1970), Follies (1971) and A Little Night Music (1973).
