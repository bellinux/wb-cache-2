5|$|In {{more general}} usage, noise is any {{unwanted}} sound or signal. In this sense, even sounds {{that would be}} perceived as musically ordinary in another context become noise if they interfere with the reception of a message desired by the receiver. Prevention and reduction of unwanted sound, <b>from</b> <b>tape</b> hiss to squeaking bass drum pedals, is important in many musical pursuits, but noise is also used creatively in many ways, and in some way in nearly all genres.|$|E
25|$|Akita's {{early work}} {{consisted}} of industrial noise music made <b>from</b> <b>tape</b> loops and conventional instruments. Similar to his present albums, he produced lengthy, disorienting pieces. He also became {{famous for the}} sheer volume of his releases.|$|E

25|$|On formal {{occasions}} women too wear a taovala, or {{more often}} a kiekie, a string skirt {{attached to a}} waistband. It is lighter and cooler than a mat. Kiekie are made from many different materials, from the traditional (pandanus leaves, as used in mats) to the innovative (unspooled magnetic tape <b>from</b> <b>tape</b> cassettes).|$|E
500|$|Most Spectrum {{software}} {{has been}} converted to current media and is available for download. One popular program for converting Spectrum files <b>from</b> <b>tape</b> is Taper; it allows connecting a cassette tape player to the line in port of a sound card, or—through a simple home-built device—to the parallel port of a PC. Once in files on a host machine, the software can be executed on an emulator.|$|E
500|$|... "The Gloaming (Softly Open our Mouths in the Cold)" [...] is an {{electronic}} song with [...] "mechanical rhythms" [...] that Jonny Greenwood built <b>from</b> <b>tape</b> loops. Greenwood {{described it as}} [...] "very old school electronica: no computers, just analogue synths, tape machines, and sellotape." [...] Yorke felt the song was [...] "the most explicit protest song on the record... I feel really strongly that it's about the rise of fascism, {{and the rise of}} intolerance and bigotry and fear, {{and all the things that}} keep a population down." [...] "There There (The Boney King of Nowhere)" [...] is a guitar-led rock song with layered percussion building to a loud climax. It was influenced by krautrock band Can, Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Pixies.|$|E

500|$|Tracks 1-10 <b>from</b> 1989 demo <b>tape</b> [...] "Not Forever, Just for Now", tracks 11-12 <b>from</b> 1988 demo <b>tape</b> [...] "Live & Otherwise", and tracks 13-17 <b>from</b> 1987 demo <b>tape</b> [...] "Colorblind and Rhymeless".|$|R
2500|$|The system MSX {{most closely}} resembled was the Spectravideo SV-328 home {{computer}} (Spectravideo even {{claimed to be}} [...] "MSX compatible" [...] in advertisements before the actual launch of MSX systems, {{but it was in}} fact not completely compatible with it). This led to a new and short-lived kind of software cracking: converting. Since the MSX games were unplayable on the SV-328 computer, SV-328 crackers developed a method of modifying the (MSX) games to make them work on the SV-328. In most cases this included downloading the MSX BIOS to the SV-328 <b>from</b> <b>tape</b> or floppy disk. Spectravideo later launched the SV-728 which completely adhered to the MSX standard.|$|E

50|$|As with The Capitol Albums, Volume 1, the CDs did {{not contain}} the {{original}} George Martin mixes released in Britain in the 1960s. Instead, the CDs were mastered <b>from</b> <b>tapes</b> prepared by Capitol A&R executive Dave Dexter, Jr., who, in 1965 took sub-master <b>tapes</b> <b>from</b> Capitol Records' vaults and added reverb to several tracks and simulated stereo on mono tracks.|$|R
50|$|The {{album was}} {{primarily}} compiled <b>from</b> <b>tapes</b> recorded by Laff Records between 1966 and 1974. By 1968, Pryor had only recorded and released one album {{up to that}} point, the eponymous debut that was released by Dove/Reprise and featured a much milder Pryor.|$|R

5000|$|Later-generation {{portable}} recorders DCC-170 and DCC-175 {{are capable}} of displaying text information <b>from</b> prerecorded <b>tapes,</b> but not <b>from</b> super-user <b>tapes.</b> The DCC-175 is capable of writing and reading the text information to/from a super-user tape via the PC, but does not show the text information on the display.|$|R
5000|$|The KC 85 {{could be}} {{programmed}} in assembly language and BASIC (the KC 85/2 had to load BASIC <b>from</b> <b>tape),</b> {{but it was}} possible to use various modules (sold by VEB Mikroelektronik Mühlhausen) or load software <b>from</b> <b>tape,</b> thus allowing programming in Forth and Pascal. The operating system was CAOS ("Cassette Aided Operating System"). It was a simple monitor where one could run different [...] "system services" [...] like LOAD (load a program), JUMP (into extension module ROM), MODIFY (memory cells) or BASIC (if it had been built into the ROM or had been loaded <b>from</b> <b>tape).</b> New commands could be added to the menu by magic numbers (standard: [...] ) anywhere in the memory space.|$|E

50|$|USB is {{unsuitable}} for {{transfer of the}} video data <b>from</b> <b>tape</b> because tape {{by its very nature}} does not support variable data rates. USB relies heavily on processor support and this was not guaranteed to service the USB port in time. The later move away <b>from</b> <b>tape</b> towards solid state memory or disc media (e.g., SD Cards, optical disks or hard drives) has facilitated moving to USB transfer because file based data can be moved in segments as required.|$|E
