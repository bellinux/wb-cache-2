By two years post-injury, 80% of men recover at least partial erectile function, though many experience problems with the reliability and duration of their erections if they do not use interventions to enhance them. Studies have found that half or up to 65% of men with SCI have orgasms, although the experience may feel <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> did before the injury. Most men say it feels weaker, and takes longer and more stimulation to achieve.|$|E
5|$|The three-story {{brick house}} {{includes}} a full elevated basement and a mansard roof with steeply pitched gabled dormers. Projecting from the roofline are plain corbeled chimneys and iron gillwork, the original roofing material was slate. The 1879 {{version of the}} Ellwood House featured dormer ornamentation with finial work. The original windows were all double-hung and of modest size, occurring both singly and in pairs while showing a variety of lintel designs. The original front (east) facade appeared much <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> does at present. The front entryway has been completely altered, due to Perry Ellwood's 1911 remodeling. The original entryway featured a one-story stone porch supported with two pilasters and two granite columns. The square projecting porch bay {{was connected to the}} ground via 12 stone stairs. In the southeast corner of the house was a full three-story projecting tower set at a 45° angle {{to the rest of the}} front facade.|$|E

500|$|When he {{returned}} to the Tigers for spring training in 1952, Tigers' manager Red Rolfe noted, [...] "Artie could be our best pitcher. He's the slump-breaking type, a guy who can throw a shutout once in a while". After a poor season without Houtteman in 1951, Rolfe predicted, [...] "We'll be back in the first division this season because Art Houtteman is back. Houtteman makes us at least a dozen games better than [...] ". Houtteman worked out in Detroit with pitcher Ted Gray over the winter before the 1952 season. Before the season started, Houtteman said, [...] "It all depends on how I get off. I'm anxious to get into the season. My arm doesn't feel any <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> did in '50. I hope I can do even better than my last year". Houtteman also took number21 on his uniform, the number he had when he first arrived with the Tigers, because he felt that it had given both him and teammate George Kell, who won a batting title with the number, good luck.|$|E

[...] Thinking of her fellow actors, she later urged viewers not to give up on the show: [...] "Do not stop watching All My Children," [...] McClain stated. [...] "There are some good actors on that show, the producers are trying new and innovative things, and the writers are trying out lots of concepts and ideas that you may ultimately find very entertaining." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 8, 1979 NBC moved Jeopardy! from 10:30a.m. to noon, {{the time}} slot the {{original}} series had occupied and {{done well in}} for many years. However, the television climate in 1979 was much <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> was in the 1960s and early 1970s. The 12:00p.m. hour was one that network affiliates often chose to pre-empt in favor of showing other programming such as a midday local newscast or a syndicated offering such as another game show or a talk show. In markets that did air Jeopardy! at noon, the show found itself losing the ratings battle against The $20,000 Pyramid on ABC and The Young and the Restless on CBS. NBC decided {{to pull the plug}} on the revived Jeopardy! series shortly after the move, and its 108th and final episode aired on March 2, 1979. Its place on the schedule was taken by Password Plus, which at the time had been airing at 12:30p.m., and the cancellation allowed NBC to expand their top rated soap opera, Another World, to ninety minutes from sixty.|$|E

2500|$|... "The {{situation}} of the Jewish people today is radically <b>different</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> was only a century ago. We have achieved the impossible. And we did so through a very necessary yet narrow Jewish nationalism called 'Zionism' that currently appears to have outlived its usefulness. If we define Zionism (as most Israelis do) not as the Jewish struggle for liberation over millennia but as a 20th century national movement that succeeded in returning the Jewish people to nationhood, we are currently living in a post-Zionist reality... Few still approach Zionism as an ideology with any intellectual depth, because the Jewish people are by and large ready and thirsty for something new. In order {{to advance to the}} next stage, however, we need to shift away from our narrow Jewish nationalism in favor of a uniquely Hebrew universalism that reflects and expresses authentic Jewish values while being more inclusive to non-Jewish groups in our society. We need to dig deeper into the wealth of our ancient sources in order to arrive at policies and structures that will at the same time make our country more Jewish, democratic and inclusive of the 'other.' Hebrew universalism {{should not be confused with}} Western universalism but should actually be seen as an alternative to it... Advancing to the next stage of Jewish liberation doesn’t require that we shrink our nationalism or negate its achievements... Our nationalism needs to deepen and expand to the point that it explodes and spills over into universalism, transcending the either/or 'Arab versus Jew' paradigm and making the State of Israel, from river to sea, both the fulfillment of historic Jewish aspirations and a genuine light unto nations that will benefit and inspire all humankind." ...|$|E
