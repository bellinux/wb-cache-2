40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{method for}} the investigation of <b>electrostenolysis</b> has been developed. <b>Electrostenolysis</b> is redefined {{in the light of}} the discovery that organic molecules are subject to it. The experimental requirements for a quantitative study are enumerated, and the apparatus and procedure described. It is found that with ferrous and ferric ions and a cellulose acetate membrane, the potential drop across the membrane must be above about 2150 v. /cm. in order to effect any oxidation and reduction. With the present apparatus and conditions the ratio of equivalents oxidized or reduced to faradays passing the membrane is low,â€” of the order of one to several thousand...|$|E
