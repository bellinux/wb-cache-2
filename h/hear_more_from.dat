500|$|Christianity Today writer Russ Breimeier was {{positive}} about Katy Hudson, highlighting Hudson's songwriting style for being [...] "insightful and well matched {{to the emotional}} power" [...] of Hudson's music. He further deemed Hudson a [...] "young talent" [...] and expected to <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>from</b> her in the next year. Similarly, Tony Cummings from Cross Rhythms also considered Hudson to be a [...] "vocal talent", recommending readers {{to listen to the}} album. The Phantom Tollbooth's Andy Argyrakis stated that Hudson having been reared in church had [...] "paid off", and noted that [...] "Although a mere pop lightweight, it's hard to ignore Hudson's sincerity and lyrical maturity." [...] DEP from Billboard, also calling Hudson a talent, classified the record as [...] "textured modern-rock collection that is equal parts grit and vulnerability" [...] and [...] "impressive". The album was a commercial failure for bankrupted Red Hill Records, only selling between 100 and 200 copies.|$|E

6000|$|She then beguiled {{the time}} with designs for gravestones, until she became uneasy at Owen's non-appearance, and longed {{to go and see}} after him; but she fancied he might have spent nights of watching, and thought sleep would be the best means of getting through the {{interval}} which appalled her mind, unused to contact with grief. Still his delay began to wear her spirits and expectation, so long wrought up to the meeting; and she was at least equally restless for the appearance of Robert, wanting to <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>from</b> him, and above all certain that all her dreary cravings and vacancy would be appeased by one dialogue with him, on whatever topic it might be. She wished that she had obeyed that morning bell at St. Wulstan's. It would have disposed of half-an-hour, and she would have met him. 'For shame,' quoth the haughty spirit, 'now that has come into my head, I can't go at all.' ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to these assumptions, standpoint theory suggests knowledge which is created by knowers as a concept of the theory. Knowledge is a familiarity with someone or something, which can include facts, information, descriptions, or skills acquired through experience or education. Also this theory highlights that social locations affect men and women's reactions in their social life. It means that [...] "the perspectives of women's lives are more important key points than women's experiences," [...] although this feminist standpoint theory needs to be developed by <b>hearing</b> <b>more</b> <b>from</b> those women {{who have not been}} examined as a part of this method.|$|R

[...] "In the midst of those trophies of Poynton, living with them, {{touching}} them, using them, I felt as if I were backing her up. As I was not {{a bit of an}} accomplice, as I hate what she has done, I didn't want to be, even to the extent of the mere look of it--what is it you call such people?--an accessory after the fact." [...] There was something she kept back so rigidly that the joy of uttering the rest was double. She felt the sharpest need of giving him all the other truth. There was a matter as to which she had deceived him, and there was a matter as to which she had deceived Mrs. Gereth, but her lack of pleasure in deception as such came home to her now. She busied herself with the tea and, to extend the occupation, cleared the table still more, spreading out the coarse cups and saucers and the vulgar little plates. She was aware that she produced more confusion than symmetry, but she was also aware that she was violently nervous. Owen tried to help her with something: this made rather for disorder. [...] "My reason for not writing to you," [...] she pursued, [...] "was simply that I was hoping to <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>from</b> Ricks. I've waited from day to day for that." ...|$|E
6000|$|He was really, notwithstanding, to <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>from</b> her of {{what she}} saw; and the very next {{occasion}} had for him still other surprises than that. He received from Mrs. Lowder {{on the morning after}} his visit to Kate the telegraphic expression of a hope that he might be free to dine with them that evening; and his freedom affected him as fortunate even though in some degree qualified by her missive. [...] "Expecting American friends whom I'm so glad to find you know!" [...] His knowledge of American friends was clearly an accident of which he was to taste the fruit to the last bitterness. This apprehension, however, we hasten to add, enjoyed for him, in the immediate event, a certain merciful shrinkage; the immediate event being that, at Lancaster Gate, five minutes after his due arrival, prescribed him for eight-thirty, Mrs. Stringham came in alone. The long daylight, the postponed lamps, the habit of the hour, made dinners late and guests still later; so that, punctual as he was, he had found Mrs. Lowder alone, with Kate herself not yet in the field. He had thus had with her several bewildering moments--bewildering by reason, fairly, of their tacit invitation to him to be supernaturally simple. This was exactly, goodness knew, what he wanted to be; but he had never had it so largely and freely--so supernaturally simply, for that matter--imputed to him as of easy achievement. It was a particular in which Aunt Maud appeared to offer herself as an example, appeared to say quite agreeably: [...] "What I want of you, don't you see? is to be just exactly as I am." [...] The quantity of the article required was what might especially have caused him to stagger--he liked so, in general, the quantities in which Mrs. Lowder dealt. He would have liked as well to ask her how feasible she supposed it for a poor young man to resemble her at any point; but he had after all soon enough perceived that he was doing as she wished by letting his wonder show just a little as silly. He was conscious moreover of a small strange dread of the results of discussion with her--strange, truly, because it was her good nature, not her asperity, that he feared. Asperity might have made him angry--in which there was always a comfort; good nature, in his conditions, had a tendency to make him ashamed--which Aunt Maud indeed, wonderfully, liking him for himself, quite struck him as having guessed. To spare him therefore she also avoided discussion; she kept him down by refusing to quarrel with him. This was what she now proposed to him to enjoy, and his secret discomfort was his sense that on the whole it was what would best suit him. Being kept down was a bore, but his great dread, verily, was of being ashamed, which was a thing distinct; and it mattered but little that he was ashamed of that too. It was of the essence of his position that in such a house as this the tables could always be turned on him. [...] "What do you offer, what do you offer?"--the place, however muffled in convenience and decorum, constantly hummed for him with that thick irony. The irony was a renewed reference to obvious bribes, and he had already seen how little aid came to him from denouncing the bribes as ugly in form. That was what the precious metals--they alone--could afford to be; it was vain enough for him accordingly to try to impart a gloss to his own comparative brummagem. The humiliation of this impotence was precisely what Aunt Maud sought to mitigate for him by keeping him down; and as her effort to that end had doubtless never yet been so visible he had probably never felt so definitely placed in the world as while he waited with her for her half-dozen other guests. She welcomed him genially back from the States, as to his view of which her few questions, though not coherent, were comprehensive, and he had the amusement of seeing in her, as through a clear glass, the outbreak of a plan and the sudden consciousness of a curiosity. She became aware of America, under his eyes, as a possible scene for social operations; the idea of a visit to the wonderful country had clearly but just occurred to her, yet she was talking of it, {{at the end of a}} minute, as her favourite dream. He didn't believe in it, but he pretended to; this helped her as well as anything else to treat him as harmless and blameless. She was so engaged, with the further aid of a complete absence of allusions, when the highest effect was given her method by the beautiful entrance of Kate. The method therefore received support all round, for no young man could have been less formidable than the person to the relief of whose shyness her niece ostensibly came. The ostensible, in Kate, struck him altogether, on this occasion, as prodigious; while scarcely less prodigious, for that matter, was his own reading, on the spot, of the relation between his companions--a relation lighted for him by the straight look, not exactly loving nor lingering, yet searching and soft, that, on the part of their hostess, the girl had to reckon with as she advanced. It took her in from head to foot, and in doing so it told a story that made poor Densher again the least bit sick: it marked so something with which Kate habitually and consummately reckoned.|$|E

Tracy Chapman and Suzanne Vega heralded this renaissance and new voices like John Gorka are emerging as part of the next wave. Four of the artists on Legacy went on to major label distribution recording deals. And far from being a flash in the pan this musical movement is very much alive and flourishing. The intelligent lyric is back. The singer-songwriter is very much a force again in today's music scene. Legacy II presents some of the finest emerging talents now recording.
