5|$|In July 1968, Nelson {{failed to}} appear for a planned meeting {{with an old}} friend. John DuBois, at whose house the meeting was {{supposed}} to take place, became worried and drove to Nelson's camp.

5|$|Racism was {{the main}} target of DuBois's polemics, and he {{strongly}} protested against lynching, Jim Crow laws, and discrimination in education and employment. His cause included people of color everywhere, particularly Africans and Asians in colonies. He was a proponent of Pan-Africanism and helped organize several Pan-African Congresses {{to fight for the}} independence of African colonies from European powers. DuBois made several trips to Europe, Africa and Asia. After World War I, <b>he</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> experiences of American black soldiers in France and documented widespread prejudice in the United States military.|$|E
5|$|Monroe studied {{surveying}} {{and began}} his career in public service as the county surveyor for Hampshire County. During his tenure, <b>he</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> majority of the county's land tracts. Monroe read law in Romney under prominent local attorney, Alfred P. White. While studying law, {{he was elected to}} represent Hampshire County in the Virginia House of Delegates alongside William P. Stump between 1850 and 1851. Monroe {{was a member of the}} Virginia House of Delegates during the 1851 reform of the Constitution of Virginia. In 1857, he was nominated as a Democratic candidate to represent the Hampshire County district in the Senate of Virginia. Monroe was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1858 at the age of 41 and engaged in a law practice in Romney. In 1859, he was elected the Commonwealth's Attorney for Hampshire County.|$|E

5|$|Harald {{became the}} first of the two Bohr {{brothers}} to earn a master's degree, which he earned for mathematics in April 1909. Niels took another nine months to earn his. Students had to submit a thesis on a subject assigned by their supervisor. Bohr's supervisor was Christiansen, and the topic he chose was the electron theory of metals. Bohr subsequently elaborated his master's thesis into his much-larger Doctor of Philosophy (dr. phil.) thesis. <b>He</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> literature on the subject, settling on a model postulated by Paul Drude and elaborated by Hendrik Lorentz, in which the electrons in a metal are considered to behave like a gas. Bohr extended Lorentz's model, but was still unable to account for phenomena like the Hall effect, and concluded that electron theory could not fully explain the magnetic properties of metals. The thesis was accepted in April 1911, and Bohr conducted his formal defence on 13 May. Harald had received his doctorate the previous year. Bohr's thesis was groundbreaking, but attracted little interest outside Scandinavia because it was written in Danish, a Copenhagen University requirement at the time. In 1921, the Dutch physicist Hendrika Johanna van Leeuwen would independently derive a theorem from Bohr's thesis that is today known as the Bohr–van Leeuwen theorem.|$|E

25|$|He {{described}} previous rulers in China, underlined {{the importance}} of the revolt by Huang Chao in the late Tang dynasty, and mentioned, though less detailed than for India, Chinese beliefs.

He conveyed the great diversity of Turkic peoples, including the distinction between sedentary and nomadic Turks. He spoke of the significance of the Khazars and provided much fresh material on them.|$|E

25|$|Björn Gunnlaugsson (25 September 1788 – 17 March 1876) was an Icelandic {{mathematician}} and cartographer. For the Icelandic Literary Society, <b>he</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> {{country from}} 1831 to 1843. The {{results of his}} work were published in a topographic map of Iceland at a scale of 1:480,000 on four sheets. It was the first complete map of Iceland and, although generally dated to 1844, was not completed until 1848. It was published {{under the direction of}} Olaf Nikolas Olsen in Copenhagen. In 1849, a smaller edition on one sheet at a scale of 1:960,000 appeared. For his survey work, Björn received the Order of the Dannebrog in 1846 and the French Légion d'honneur in 1859.|$|E
25|$|Stationed at Fort George (the former site of Fort William Henry) in 1765, he {{witnessed}} rioting in Albany and New York City {{in response to}} the Stamp Act, and in the same year was promoted to captain lieutenant, and engineer extraordinary, as well as barrackmaster for ordnance in North America. Over the next several years, <b>he</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> boundary between New York and New Jersey, and he repaired or constructed barracks and fortifications in Boston, New York City, the Bahamas, and Philadelphia, where he would build a fortification on Mud Island. During this period he also took a six-month leave in England, and spent time on Bermuda. He also purchased an island in New York Harbor which would be called Montresor's Island (now Randall's Island).|$|E
25|$|Thetis was {{designed}} by Read, Chatfield and Creuze {{and she was the}} only ship of her class, which was approved on 16 March 1843. With the approval of the final order Thetis was laid down at Devonport Dockyard on 2 December 1844. She was launched on 21 August 1846 and duly commissioned for service on 30 December 1846, having cost £40,605, this rising to £51,926 to have her fitted for sea. From 3 July 1850 to February 1854, her captain was Augustus Leopold Kuper. He commissioned her at Plymouth and sailed her to the south-east coast of America and then the Pacific. Kuper Island, one of the Gulf Islands in the Strait of Georgia, off the east coast of Vancouver Island, is named for him after <b>he</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> area from 1851–53. A nearby island is named Thetis Island and several other localities on Vancouver Island are named after the ship, including Thetis Lake, Thetis Cove, Thetis Crescent and Thetis Lane.|$|E

25|$|In 1891, Arthur, Clara, {{and their}} new son Edward Oliver Wheeler headed west to New Westminster, British Columbia where Wheeler went into private {{practice}} as a surveyor. His private surveying work was supplemented by work for the Department of the Interior, and he was joined in his surveying business by his younger brothers Hector and Willie. A real estate crash nearly wiped them out, and in 1894 he rejoined the Topographical Survey Branch of the Department of the Interior. Wheeler spent six years surveying the area south of Calgary, Alberta and in 1898 moved {{his wife and son}} to Calgary. During this period <b>he</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> watersheds of the Elbow, Sheep, Highwood, Oldman, Belly, Waterton, Little Bow, St. Mary and Milk Rivers. In 1900, the Department of the Interior announced it was going to close its office in Calgary, so Wheeler spent the summer surveying the Crowsnest Pass area in Alberta, and in 1901 the Wheelers returned to Ottawa.|$|E
25|$|Wallace-Johnson did not {{immediately}} involve himself in Gold Coast politics. <b>He</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> political atmosphere and reestablished connections he had made in his trips to Europe. Most of his activities involved political agitation, as he began working with the Gold Coast Drivers' Union, and started contributing articles to local newspapers like the Gold Coast Spectator, the Vox Populi and the Gold Coast Provincial Pioneer. He also helped workers who suffered injustice by preparing legal documentation for cases. Overall, he tried to raise political expectations regarding peoples' rights {{and their ability to}} influence political decision-making. Through contacts in London, he arranged for questions to be asked by sympathetic left wing Labour Party members in the British Parliament about working conditions and rights in the colonies. Wallace-Johnson also established a new form of mass demonstrations, in which members of the traditional elite no longer dominated African politics. In Wallace-Johnson's reformation of mass meetings, ordinary citizens could vocalise their political opinions. These people took full advantage of the new system; they frequently lambasted colonial authorities and the political establishment, in general. The idea won Wallace-Johnson widespread acclaim and adulation.|$|E
25|$|The {{commander}} of the II Corps, Maj. Gen. Darius N. Couch, was dismayed at the carnage wrought upon his two divisions in the hour of fighting and, like Col. Miles, realized that the tactics were not working. He first considered a massive bayonet charge to overwhelm the defenders, but as <b>he</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> front, he quickly realized that French's and Hancock's divisions were in no shape to move forward again. He next planned for his final division, commanded by Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard, to swing {{to the right and}} attempt to envelop the Confederate left, but upon receiving urgent requests for help from French and Hancock, he sent Howard's men over and around the fallen troops instead. The brigade of Col. Joshua Owen went in first, reinforced by Col. Norman J. Hall's brigade, and then two regiments of Brig. Gen. Alfred Sully's brigade. The other corps in Sumner's grand division was the IX Corps, and he sent in one of its divisions under Brig. Gen. Samuel Sturgis. After two hours of desperate fighting, four Union divisions had failed in the mission Burnside had originally assigned to one. Casualties were heavy: II Corps losses for the afternoon were 4,114, Sturgis's division 1,011.|$|E

500|$|Pei's {{approach}} to the new Dallas City Hall mirrored those of other projects; <b>he</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>the</b> surrounding area and worked to make the building fit. In the case of Dallas, he spent days meeting with residents {{of the city and}} was impressed by their civic pride. He also found that the skyscrapers of the downtown business district dominated the skyline, and sought to create a building which could face the tall buildings and represent the importance of the public sector. He spoke of creating [...] "a public-private dialogue with the commercial high-rises".|$|E
