500|$|At Derek's loft, {{he tells}} Karen {{he needs to}} see [...] "everything you've got," [...] a come-on that {{momentarily}} panics Karen. Derek accuses her of playing the innocent and pretending not to know why she was invited to the director's loft {{in the middle of}} the night. She retreats to the bathroom and gathers her nerves. When she comes back, she is in nothing but his shirt and, singing [...] "Happy Birthday, Mr. President" [...] as Marilyn, she climbs <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap,</b> straddling him, then pulls away and says [...] "not gonna happen". The next day, Karen and Ivy go to their callback singing [...] "Let Me Be Your Star", which closes out the episode.|$|E
2500|$|When Luke sits on Jay's [...] "Ludlum's" [...] (his e-reader) Jay {{opens the}} cover and the glass tinkles <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap,</b> he says [...] "not fair, it's not fair." [...] This {{references}} the original Twilight Zone episode [...] "Time Enough at Last". In the episode there is an antisocial man with bad vision and very thick glasses who wants {{nothing more than to}} be completely alone so he can read his books. One day there is a disaster that kills everyone but him, and one of the only buildings left standing is the library. He sits down to read to his heart's content, but his glasses fall off and hit the ground, he picks them up to put them on and the glass from the lens falls tinkling on to his lap. He sits down and says [...] "it isn't fair, it just isn't fair." ...|$|E
60|$|Dan'l Borem poured half of {{his second}} cup of tea abstractedly <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|E
6000|$|In {{his dream}} {{he reached his}} sordid home all out of breath, but with eyes dancing with {{grateful}} enthusiasm; cast four of <b>his</b> pennies <b>into</b> <b>his</b> mother's <b>lap</b> and cried out-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Demorest {{has been}} urging me very {{strongly}} {{to go to}} California, but, of course, I spoke of you," [...] he said, stealing <b>his</b> hand <b>into</b> <b>his</b> wife's <b>lap,</b> and possessing himself of her fingers.|$|R
60|$|The old lady, {{as usual}} when surprised, became speechless; the captain smiled and Minnie laughed, but when Ruby put <b>his</b> hand <b>into</b> another pocket {{and began to}} draw forth golden sovereigns, and pour them <b>into</b> <b>his</b> mother's <b>lap,</b> the captain became supremely amazed, the old woman laughed, and,--so strangely {{contradictory}} and unaccountable is human nature,--Minnie began to cry.|$|R
60|$|Bella {{walked along}} toward her father--for {{she had just}} learned to walk--and {{attempted}} to climb up <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|E
60|$|The wren hopped <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap,</b> and {{carefully}} opening {{one of its}} tiny claws disclosed the identical spider's eye which Maetta had given him.|$|E
60|$|After supper was over, the Captain was {{besieged by}} the children. Little Mara mounted first <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap,</b> and nestled herself quietly under his coat--Moses and Sally stood at each knee.|$|E
50|$|In 1971, {{vertical}} fins {{were added}} {{to the rear of the}} 908s which were outpaced at the Targa by two Alfa Romeo Tipo 33s. All entered 908s crashed (2 on the first lap; Brian Redman was badly injured after crashing 20 miles <b>into</b> <b>his</b> first <b>lap),</b> but Vic Elford had managed to set fastest lap. The next race at the Nurburgring saw a 1-2-3 finish for the 908 in front of two Alfas, but with Alfa scoring wins at Brands Hatch and Watkins Glen, it was proven that these prototypes could even beat the 917s.|$|R
50|$|Race day {{was bright}} and clear with a record crowd of nearly 60,000. A dummy grid {{was used for the}} first time in a Championship Grand Prix, and when the field moved forward to the {{starting}} grid, Clark's Lotus remained still. At the flag, Hill led Ginther, Surtees, Gurney, Tony Maggs, Gregory and Brabham up the hill and through the Esses. The Lotus crew discovered that Clark's battery was dead, and by the time they replaced it, Broeker's Stebro, trailing the field, was already <b>into</b> <b>his</b> second <b>lap.</b>|$|R
60|$|One evening, after tea, when Rollo was {{a pretty}} big boy, he came and began to climb up <b>into</b> <b>his</b> father's <b>lap.</b> When he had climbed up, he took his place astride of his father's knee, {{as if he were}} riding a horse. His little brother Nathan came up and stood near, wanting to get up too, only there was not room. His cousin James was there, that evening, on a visit. He sat upon a cricket before the fire, and his mother was at the table doing some sort of work.|$|R
6000|$|... "No I ain't, Mr. Moulder, and so, John, there's my hand again, and you're free {{to take it}} if you like." [...] And so {{saying she}} put forth her hand almost <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It is this {{prolonged}} uncertainty that's {{so hard to}} bear," [...] remarked Ravonino to Mark one day, {{lifting his}} hands high above his head, and letting them fall, with the clanking chains, <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|E
6000|$|She crept <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> {{and kissed}} him. [...] "You do not love me any more," [...] she announced. [...] "No one loves me," [...] {{but she could}} not compose her {{features}} into a pout because bubbling laughter insisted upon breaking through.|$|E
60|$|So, then, Sir Oliver {{sat at his}} ease in his tall, carved chair, his doublet untrussed, {{his long}} legs {{stretched}} before him, a pensive smile about the firm lips that as yet were darkened {{by no more than}} a small black line of moustachios. (Lord Henry's portrait of him was drawn at a much later period.) It was noon, and our gentleman had just dined, as the platters, the broken meats and the half-empty flagon on the board beside him testified. He pulled thoughtfully at a long pipe--for he had acquired this newly imported habit of tobacco-drinking--and dreamed of his mistress, and was properly and gallantly grateful that fortune had used him so handsomely as to enable him to toss a title and some measure of renown <b>into</b> <b>his</b> Rosamund's <b>lap.</b>|$|R
25|$|A second thirty-minute {{practice}} session was held the following day, with Mortara setting the fastest time; the only driver to break <b>into</b> the 2:10s. <b>His</b> <b>lap</b> of 2:10.593, was an unofficial lap record {{as it was}} the fastest lap ever recorded at the Guia Circuit. It was more than a second under Marko Asmer's official lap record, set in 2007. Eight other drivers were also under the old mark, with tenth place Bianchi just outside the record. Ricciardo continued his fine form in second, despite not improving his time after a mid-session setup change. Bottas was third ahead of Hartley, Ericsson, Bird and the rest. Apart from an accident involving Chen at Maternity, this session passed relatively peacefully.|$|R
50|$|Parnelli Jones {{becomes the}} first driver to break the 150 mph barrier. <b>His</b> first <b>lap</b> was run at 150.729 mph, a new all-time one-lap track record. All four of <b>his</b> <b>laps</b> were over 150 mph, and his four-lap average came in at 150.370 mph. Jones was rewarded by having 150 silver dollars poured <b>into</b> <b>his</b> helmet by Phil Hedback of Bryant Heating & Cooling.|$|R
6000|$|She dropped <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> and (after he had jerked {{back his}} head to save his eye-glasses, and removed the glasses, and settled her in a {{position}} less cramping to his legs, and casually cleared his throat) he kissed her amiably, and remarked: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{desire to}} fall on his neck and kiss him was, need we say, almost irresistible, but the poor girl had {{received}} strength for the duty in hand. She went close to him--even brushed past him--and dropped the biscuits <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|E
60|$|But before Master Courage had {{the time}} to indulge in this, the desire of his heart, {{something}} fell upon the top of his lean head which certainly never grew on the elm tree overhead. Having struck his lanky hair the object fell straight <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|E
500|$|Earnhardt {{who began}} {{the race in}} thirty-second, had moved up {{nineteen}} positions to thirteenth by lap 24. Two laps later, Ambrose began to slow and made a pit stop three laps later to change his car's battery. On lap 33, Stewart passed Johnson to become the new race leader while Ambrose's car went <b>into</b> <b>his</b> garage. Three <b>laps</b> later, [...] Earnhard. had passed McMurray for tenth position. On lap 38, Clint Bowyer passed Martin for fourth position, as Ambrose rejoined the race four laps later. On lap 47, Kurt Busch passed Martin to claim sixth position. Three laps later, green flag pit stops began, as Matt Kenseth and Martin {{were the first to}} pit. Johnson made his pit stop one lap later.|$|R
60|$|Mr Palliser was by {{no means}} sure that he would excuse him, and sat himself {{suddenly}} upright in his chair in a manner that was intended to exhibit a first symptom of outraged dignity. But, singularly enough, he had himself been thinking of marriage at that moment. How would it have been with him had he known the beautiful Griselda before the Dumbello alliance had been arranged? Would he have married her? Would he have been comfortable if he had married her? Of course he could not marry now, seeing that {{he was in love with}} Lady Dumbello, and that the lady in question, unfortunately, had a husband of her own; but though he had been thinking of marrying, he did not like to have the subject thus roughly thrust before his eyes, and, as it were, <b>into</b> <b>his</b> very <b>lap</b> by <b>his</b> uncle's agent. Mr Fothergill, no doubt, saw the first symptom of outraged dignity, for he was a clever, sharp man. But, perhaps, he did not in truth much regard it. Perhaps he had received instructions which he was bound to regard above all other matters.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hallo! don't run us ashore," [...] shouted Mr Sudberry, {{starting}} {{up with a}} sudden impetuosity which shook the boat and sent a pang {{to the heart of}} his wife, the sharpness of which no words can convey. A piercing shriek, however, betrayed the state of her feelings as the boat was swept violently round by George to avoid a point of rock. As they were now drawing near to the spot where it was proposed that they should picnic, Jacky suddenly became alive to the fact that in his interest about old Moggy he had been betrayed into a forgetfulness of his opportunities. No time was to be lost. Turning round with a cheer, he made a desperate plunge at the water and went much farther over than he had intended, insomuch that he would certainly have taken a [...] "header" [...] into its depths, had not McAllister grasped him by the baggy region of his trousers and gravely lifted him <b>into</b> <b>his</b> mother's <b>lap.</b> Next moment the boat's keel grated sharply on the gravel, to the horror of Mrs Sudberry, who, having buried her face in the bosom of her saved son, saw not what had occurred, and regarded the shock as her death-warrant.|$|R
60|$|He ceased {{speaking}} {{to note the}} effect of his words on his hearers. They were electrical. The Sky Pilot sat up straight and slapped his thigh. Soup Face opened his mouth, letting his pipe fall out <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap,</b> setting fire to his ragged trousers. Dirty Eddie voiced a characteristic obscenity.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{so sorry}} Pat is mad, 'cause {{he saw this}} piece and told me about it, and he'd like to help me put up these pictures," [...] said Johnny to himself, one breezy morning, as he sat {{examining}} a big poster which the wind had sent flying <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> a few minutes before.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's great!" [...] he cried. [...] "I {{guess you}} don't know who I am, kiddo. You won't cop off {{anything}} better in this joint than Steve Murray. Come on--let's be friends. That's a good girl," [...] and before Elizabeth realized the man's intentions he had seized her wrist {{and pulled her}} down <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Warsylewicz, who clocked {{the first}} 3,000 metres in 3:54.51, was only 0.6 seconds behind Donagrandi then. However, he {{finished}} with laps of 34 and 35; Donagrandi kept <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> times better, only bursting <b>into</b> 32 on <b>his</b> penultimate <b>lap,</b> and went into second place with 6:33.45, over 10 seconds ahead of Warsylewicz.|$|R
50|$|Ma {{missed out}} on <b>his</b> Q3 <b>lap</b> when he failed {{to get out of}} the pits in time before the red light came on and he was to remain in fifth place. Valente was the next driver to go out and set <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> {{followed}} by Loeb who ran wide at the final corner of <b>his</b> out <b>lap</b> and put himself provisionally second behind Valente. Muller was next out and <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> put him on pole with López only going third on <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> after a mistake at turn three.|$|R
6000|$|The Sacian was, in fact, uncommonly {{accomplished}} {{in respect to}} the personal grace and dexterity for which cup-bearers in those days were most highly valued, and which constitute, in fact, so essential {{a part of the}} qualifications of a master of ceremonies at a royal court in every age. Cyrus, however, instead of yielding to this argument, said, in reply, that he could come into the room and pour out the wine as well as the Sacian could do it, and he asked his grandfather to allow him to try. Astyages consented. Cyrus then took the goblet of wine, and went out. In a moment he came in again, stepping grandly, as he entered, in mimicry of the Sacian, and with a countenance of assumed gravity and self-importance, which imitated so well the air and manner of the cup-bearer as greatly to amuse the whole company assembled. Cyrus advanced thus toward the king and presented him with the cup, imitating, with the grace and dexterity natural to childhood, all the ceremonies which he had seen the cup-bearer himself perform, except that of tasting the wine. The king and Mandane laughed heartily. Cyrus then, throwing off his assumed character, jumped up <b>into</b> <b>his</b> grandfather's <b>lap</b> and kissed him, and turning to the cup-bearer, he said, [...] "Now, Sacian, you are ruined. I shall get my grandfather to appoint me in your place. I can hand the wine as well as you, and without tasting it myself at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|Verrian {{returned}} to his cigar, from which the ashen wraith dropped <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap.</b> [...] "I guess you'll {{have to be a}} little clearer." [...] But as Bushwick continued silently looking at him, the thing could not be left at this point, and he was obliged to ask of his own initiative, [...] "How much do you know?" ...|$|E
60|$|The door closed. R. Jones {{remained}} {{where he}} sat, his fingers straying luxuriously among the crackling paper. A feeling of complete happiness warmed R. Jones' bosom. He was uncertain {{whether or not}} his mission would be successful; and to be truthful he was not letting that worry him much. What he was certain of {{was the fact that}} the heavens had opened unexpectedly and dropped five hundred pounds <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|E
60|$|Miranda, {{hearing him}} so silent, rose. At this hour {{it was her}} master's habit to scratch paper. She, who seldom {{scratched}} anything, {{because it was not}} delicate, felt dimly that this was what he should be doing. She held up a slim foot and touched his knee. Receiving no discouragement, she delicately sprang <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>lap,</b> and, forgetting for once her modesty, placed her arms on his chest, and licked his face all over.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the hens}} pleased with that, Some laid eggs in <b>his</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|R
