25|$|Culture or PCR are {{the current}} means for {{detecting}} {{the presence of}} the organism, as serologic studies only test for antibodies of Borrelia. OspA antigens, shedded by live Borrelia bacteria into urine, are a promising technique being studied. The use of nanotrap particles for their detection is being looked at and the OspA has been linked to active symptoms of Lyme. High titers of either immunoglobulin G (IgG) or <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>M</b> (IgM) antibodies to Borrelia antigens indicate disease, but lower titers can be misleading, because the IgM antibodies may remain after the initial infection, and IgG antibodies may remain for years.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to VZV in {{a healthy}} child initiates the {{production}} of host immunoglobulin G (IgG), <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>M</b> (IgM), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies; IgG antibodies persist for life and confer immunity. Cell-mediated immune responses are also important in limiting the scope and the duration of primary varicella infection. After primary infection, VZV is hypothesized to spread from mucosal and epidermal lesions to local sensory nerves. VZV then remains latent in the dorsal ganglion cells of the sensory nerves. Reactivation of VZV results in the clinically distinct syndrome of herpes zoster (i.e., shingles), postherpetic neuralgia, and sometimes Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II. Varicella zoster can affect the arteries in the neck and head, producing stroke, either during childhood, or after a latency period of many years.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} of reactive derivatives of oligonucleotides bearing a 4 -[(N- 2 -chloroethyl-N-methyl) amino]benzylamin residue at the 5 ′-terminal phosphate with serum blood proteins has been investigated.

The reactions with immunoglobulins were inhibited in the presence of different oligonucleotides, DNA and heparin, suggesting the oligonucleotide binding to some cationic region of the proteins.

40|$|Recent {{work from}} several {{laboratories}} {{has demonstrated that}} proteolytic mechanisms significantly contribute to the molecular interplay between Streptococcus pyogenes, an important human pathogen, and its host.
