25|$|In October 2015, a $16 million TIGER {{grant was}} awarded {{and will be}} used to support early {{construction}} activities such as realignment of a 138 kV transmission monopole, constructing a temporary fiber optic cable pole line, building a <b>finger</b> <b>pier</b> construction access structure, a service access road and a 560-foot retaining wall.|$|E
25|$|Phase 1 of this {{development}} would be undertaken by 2015. It {{would include the}} in-progress construction of the eastern apron extension and provision of a <b>finger</b> <b>pier</b> {{to the south of}} this apron to provide passenger access to aircraft using the new parking stands. The terminal building would also be extended to use the triangle of land between it and the railway station. The existing jet centre serving corporate aviation would be extended, a new hangar built to allow aircraft maintenance, and a replacement fire station provided.|$|E
50|$|The port {{consists}} of an 800m <b>finger</b> <b>pier,</b> which comprises 10 berths. Three additional 200m conventional berths are located next to the <b>finger</b> <b>pier</b> and two 300m container berths with a depth of 11m. An Outer arm quay of 285m, alongside a 7m depth draught and storage space {{consists of}} 10 sheds plus additional open storage and container storage areas totaling 538,000m sq, are present. The cargo handling area covers an area of 60,000m sq.|$|E
5000|$|Used to {{maximize}} the berthing space per length of waterfront. [...] <b>Finger</b> <b>piers</b> are often used for small to medium vessels associated with passenger travel. <b>Finger</b> <b>piers</b> {{can also be used}} for dangerous cargoes such as military munitions that can not be used with offshore berths because of the weight and equipment requirements. In these instances long <b>finger</b> <b>piers</b> allow for far reach far off shore with access for rail or other cargo moving methods on the pier.|$|R
50|$|Historically, the Kingston {{waterfront}} was Jamaica's {{main port}} with many <b>finger</b> <b>piers</b> at which freighters and passenger liners could dock. More recently, with the containerisation of freight, the port {{has moved to}} Newport West.|$|R
5000|$|BHYC's home, Sunrise Shore Marina (formerly Barrachois Marina), {{was opened}} 6 July 1997 by Dana and Mary Hunter of nearby Lower Waugh's River. The {{original}} {{capacity of the}} marina was 64 slips with all floating docks and <b>finger</b> <b>piers,</b> as well being {{the only source of}} dockside gasoline on the north shore of Nova Scotia between the New Brunswick border and Pictou.|$|R
50|$|Additionally a new {{multi-level}} passenger <b>finger</b> (<b>pier)</b> {{that will}} enable the separation of arriving and departing passengers, as required by security regulations, will be included.|$|E

50|$|Caven Point, Jersey City, New Jersey, an {{ammunition}} and explosives loading facility with a pier for direct loading of ships from rail cars. The facility, with misgivings {{due to its}} proximity to inhabited areas, was built as {{an expansion of the}} Lehigh Valley Railroad Claremont terminal with six <b>finger</b> <b>piers</b> after Navy's acquisition of the Bayonne Terminal made it unavailable for Army use.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries it handled a large local trade {{and was the}} chief {{entrepot}} for British exports to the Spanish colonies. For {{the remainder of the}} 19th century its development as a port was retarded by a decline in the Jamaican economy. Throughout this period there was a gradual {{increase in the number of}} <b>finger</b> <b>piers</b> and wharves along its long sheltered waterfront.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of {{containerization}} and San Francisco's limited real estate, Oakland became the primary Bay Area port in the 1960s. The <b>finger</b> <b>piers</b> located along the northern waterfront quickly became outdated. San Francisco made an attempt to retain cargo capabilities by building new facilities in {{the southeast corner of}} the city. San Francisco's limited cargo facilities are located at Pier 80, 92, 94, and 96.|$|R
50|$|The third berth was {{completed}} February 2004, {{consisting of a}} 240 by 13 m concrete decked <b>finger</b> <b>pier</b> supported on tubular piles; the design gave a 17 m water depth at high tide (8 m tidal range), and allowed berthing of ships up to 35,000 gross tonnes and 200 m long.|$|E
50|$|Terminal A {{contains}} gates prefixed A. It {{opened in}} 1971, {{and it is}} used exclusively by flights to and from destinations inside the Schengen Area, including domestic flights within Switzerland. Since its expansion in 1982-1985, it {{takes the form of}} a <b>finger</b> <b>pier,</b> directly connected at one end to the Airside Centre.|$|E
50|$|Construction was {{undertaken}} by Graham construction. The terminal consisted of an approach jetty approximately 250 m long; a floating concrete pontoon of 80 by 30 m, 5m deep weighing over 7000ton; a 70 m linkspan bridge connecting the pontoon to jetty; and a <b>finger</b> <b>pier</b> dividing the two berthing positions. The installation was constructed using 165 tubular steel piles between 762 and 1420 mm diameter, up to 38 m long.|$|E
50|$|The old <b>finger</b> <b>piers</b> of {{the east}} end, piers such as Evans Coleman Evans; and Lapointe, which had been in Vancouver since its incorporation, gave way. Building rubble was dumped on the {{foreshore}} at Main Street and a peninsula where the Hastings Mill once sat and a massive terminal was created {{at the behest of}} Barney Johnson with Federal money in 1958, hence the Centennial Year and name (BC's 100's birthday).|$|R
5000|$|Pier Complex: The station's pier {{complex is}} one of the longest [...] "finger piers" [...] in the world. A two-mile (3 km) trestle connects to three <b>finger</b> <b>piers.</b> One mile from the shore the trestle {{branches}} off to Pier 1. At the junction of Piers 2, 3 and 4, a concrete platform supports a forklift/battery-recharging shop and the port operations building. This area is known as the [...] "wye." ...|$|R
50|$|Cebu International Port and Cebu Domestic Port serves {{container}} {{vessels and}} passenger ships with destinations {{around the country}} and the world. Cebu International Port is a multipurpose terminal covering an area of 10 hectares with 690 meters of berthing space and a controlling draught of minus 8.5 meters at MLLW. The Cebu Baseport - Domestic Zone is the area for the domestic transactions of different business coming from and going to the different island of the archipelago. It is dedicated to coastwise shipping with 3.5 kilometers of berthing space, 3 <b>finger</b> <b>piers</b> and 3 passenger terminals.|$|R

50|$|Terminal B {{contains}} gates prefixed B and D. It {{opened in}} 1975 and reopened in November 2011 after an extensive three-year reconstruction. Like terminal A, {{it takes the}} form of a <b>finger</b> <b>pier</b> directly connected at one end to the Airside Centre. Since reconstruction, it can accommodate both Schengen and non-Schengen flights at the same gates. Each gate has two numbers, one prefixed B and the other D, but with different passenger routes to and from the gates to separate the flows of Schengen and non-Schengen passengers.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is presently owned by South End Marina, {{and used for}} general storage. The original marine leg boat unloading towers and railroad tracks have been removed as the {{building is}} no longer used for grain storage. The south end marina operated on the property from the mid-1980s until 2011 when it closed after a fire that burned down the boat mechanic shop. The long <b>finger</b> <b>pier</b> that forms the dock that the elevator sits on {{is used as a}} base of operations for local dredging projects and marine equipment is often tied up there. This dock was also the last port of call for the vessels Aquarama/Marine Star and Lansdowne before both ships were towed away for scrap.|$|E
50|$|Singapore Changi Airport's oldest {{terminal}} operated as {{the sole}} terminal from its opening on 1 July 1981 {{right up until the}} opening of Terminal 2 nine years later. Configured in a H-shaped layout to maximise the number of aerobridges which may be built, it underwent two major upgrading works over its lifespan. A major refurbishment was completed in 1995 at a cost of S$170 million and work to extend two <b>finger</b> <b>piers</b> to add 14 aerobridges at a cost of S$420 million took place from 1996 to 1999. Today, the terminal spans an area of 308,000 m² and can accommodate a maximum passenger capacity of 21 million passengers a year.|$|R
2500|$|After the war {{commercial}} fishing increased in Victoria. To accommodate the increase a $100,000 Fisherman's Wharf was built near Erie Street, opening 31 March 1948. The [...] wharf could moor 60 fish packing ships along six <b>finger</b> float <b>piers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tiên Sa Seaport has a {{navigation}} {{depth of}} 11 m, {{and is able}} to receive medium range tankers of up to 45,000 DWT, as well as container ships of up to 2,000 TEUs and large cruise ships of up to 75,000 GRT. A 450 m breakwater provides protection from high waves and monsoons. The terminal has five berths in total: four berths, located along two <b>finger</b> <b>piers</b> of 185 m each, and one 225 m berth on a wharf along the shore, for a total of 965 m Throughput capacity at this terminal is over 4.5 million tons per year. Tiên Sa terminal contains 13665 m2 of warehouse space and 138251 m2 of yards.|$|R
5000|$|Acquired by the US Maritime Commission on June 10, 1941 {{as part of}} {{an effort}} to {{increase}} US-Flag merchant marine shipping capacity, El Estero was purchased from Southern Pacific and placed operation with United States Lines under a Panamanian registry. Pressed into service carrying war supplies from the United States to Europe during World War II, the ship made several Atlantic crossings in convoys which frequently came under U-Boat attack, including Convoy PQ 13 in March 1942. Continuing this duty into 1943, El Estero put into New York Harbor in early April 1943 where she waited her turn to load munitions at the long <b>finger</b> <b>pier</b> of the New York Port of Embarkation's Caven Point Terminal off Jersey City, New Jersey.|$|E
50|$|Working piers {{were built}} for the {{handling}} of passengers and cargo onto and off ships or (as at Wigan Pier) canal boats. Working piers themselves fall into two different groups. Longer individual piers are often found at ports with large tidal ranges, with the pier stretching far enough off shore to reach deep water at low tide. Such piers provided an economical alternative to impounded docks where cargo volumes were low, or where specialist bulk cargo was handled, such as at coal piers. The other form of working pier, often called the <b>finger</b> <b>pier,</b> was built at ports with smaller tidal ranges. Here the principal advantage was to give a greater available quay length for ships to berth against compared to a linear littoral quayside, and such piers are usually much shorter. Typically each pier would carry a single transit shed {{the length of the}} pier, with ships berthing bow or stern in to the shore. Some major ports consisted of large numbers of such piers lining the foreshore, classic examples being the Hudson River frontage of New York, or the Embarcadero in San Francisco.|$|E
40|$|The Black Wharf was {{originally}} a <b>finger</b> <b>pier</b> placed {{to slow the}} adverse effects of river sand and tidal action on {{the depth of the}} Gut. Over the years, the structural material of the Black Wharf has changed and today this structure is technically a rock breakwater. The first version of the Black Wharf was constructed of wooden pilings in the late 1960 s. The pilings where treated with creosote whose black color christened the structure. Although the Black Wharf is no longer technically a wharf, it has kept its name a way to capture memories of youthful days and nights spent on, below, beside, off, {{and at the end of}} the Black Wharf...|$|E
50|$|The 12 ha port {{facility}} has two <b>finger</b> <b>piers</b> designated Pier A (to the south) and Pier B (to the north). Berths on each pier are designated North and South. South A extends for 335 m, North A extends for 243 m. Pier B berths were extended to 317 m by installing a mooring dolphin in 2009. Each berth can accommodate a vessel with a draft {{in excess of}} 10 m at low tide. Although there are four berths, a maximum of three ships can be accommodated in port {{at any one time}} due to the close proximity of North A and South B. Canada Border Services Agency facilities are located at each pier. Pier A also houses a 9290 m2 warehouse, complete with cable ship spooling apparatus and cable storage facility.|$|R
50|$|The {{terminal}} has 12 {{gates and}} is a <b>pier</b> <b>finger</b> lay out near {{the middle of the}} airfield, almost parallel to the runway.|$|R
25|$|Throughout the 1950s, over 130 {{warehouses}} and 25 <b>finger</b> <b>piers</b> were demolished along Brooklyn's waterfront. In order to accommodate larger ships and cargo, the New York Dock Company built 13 new piers between 1956 and 1964—this development includes Piers 1–3 and 5–6 {{of what is}} currently Brooklyn Bridge Park. Pier 2 was not developed until 1958. However, as trade technology advanced, so did trade routes. By the 1970 much of the Brooklyn waterfront developments were largely barren and decrepit, causing the Port Authority to end cargo ship operations in 1983. Many of these warehouses were demolished {{by the end of}} the 20th century. However, the warehouses on the piers comprising Brooklyn Bridge Park were not demolished until the park began its construction in 2008. In 2011 Brooklyn Bridge Park won the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence silver medal.|$|R
50|$|These {{were the}} only group of piers in the Port of San Francisco {{dedicated}} chiefly to inland trade and transport. These connections facilitated the growth of communities in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys and fostered California's agricultural business that led the state to become the richest in the nation, as well the fifth largest economy in the world. The Delta King and Delta Queen provided overnight connections between San Francisco and Sacramento from Pier 1½, making it an important gateway for public travel to {{the interior of the}} state. Pier 3 and Pier 5 served primarily freight shipping, with a variety of companies sharing the bulkhead office and warehouse spaces and the huge transit sheds which originally extended the full length of the <b>finger</b> <b>piers</b> for more than 700 feet (212 m) east from the wharf on the Embarcadero.|$|R

5000|$|Before World War II, Mare Island {{had been}} in a continual state of up-building. By 1941, new {{projects}} included improvements to the central power plant, a new pattern storage building, a large foundry, machine shop, magazine building, paint shop, new administration building, and a huge storehouse. The yard was expected to be able to repair and paint six to eight large naval vessels at a time. Several <b>finger</b> <b>piers</b> had recently been built, as well as a new shipbuilding wharf, adding one 500 ft and a 750 ft berth. It employed 5593 workers at the beginning of 1939, and rapidly increased to 18,500 by May 1941, with a monthly payroll of $3,500,000. In 1941, the drafting department had expanded to three buildings accommodating over 400 naval architects, engineers and draftsmen. The hospital had 584 beds.

In 1941, the drafting department had expanded to three buildings accommodating over 400 naval architects, engineers and draftsmen. The hospital carried 584 bed patients. Mare Island became one of the Navy's shipbuilding sites in World War II specializing in building diesel engine-powered submarines; they eventually built 32 of them. After the war was over, Mare Island became a premier site for building nuclear-powered submarines, building 27 of them.|$|R
50|$|O'Halloran {{began his}} career in 1922 as a {{messenger}} and {{worked his way up}} the ranks. During World War II he organized a system of cargo control for the Boston Port of Embarkation which was copied by other ports throughout the United States. In 1948 he was named general manager of Tidewater Terminal, Inc. From 1955 to 1957 O'Halloran served {{as the director of the}} Port of Boston, the predecessor of the Massachusetts Port Authority. From 1957 to 1959, O'Halloran was the executive vice president of Wiggins Terminals, Inc., which operated piers in Charlestown, and general manager of Terminal Operators, which leased and managed the piers at the South Boston Army Base. From 1959 to 1963, O'Halloran served as the executive director of the Massachusetts Port Authority. During his tenure with the Massachusetts Port Authority, it began a massive remodeling job of Logan International Airport, which included the redesign and reconstruction of hundreds of acres of buildings, roadways, and taxiways, including the construction of four <b>finger</b> <b>piers</b> and two new terminals. After leaving the Massachusetts Port Authority, O'Halloran served as president of Port Terminals, Inc.|$|R
50|$|With Changi-based Singapore Airlines {{being the}} launch {{customer}} for the Airbus A380, works to ensure full capability in handling the large aircraft were given priority {{in time for}} its introduction in October 2007. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore spent S$60 million in upgrading the two existing terminals and airport infrastructure, including enlarged gate holdrooms, new <b>finger</b> <b>piers,</b> and extended baggage belt carousels from the normal 70 m to 90 m. With these new carousels in place, the airport does not expect embarking and disembarking passengers and baggage from the A380 to take longer than it does from a Boeing 747-400, which carries fewer passengers. On 16 August 2005, Changi Airport unveiled the first of 11 specially built gates capable of handling the giant aircraft. Costing S$15 million, the gates or 'fingers' enable passengers to board the upper deck of the new 555-seater aircraft directly from the gate hold rooms. The hold rooms themselves have been enlarged and appointed to cater for the larger number of passengers aboard an A380. Beside the 11 new A380-capable gates at Terminals 1 and 2, eight more A380-capable gates were opened at Terminal 3 on 9 January 2008.|$|R
