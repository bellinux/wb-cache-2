5|$|In 1843, U.S. President John Tyler, unaligned {{with any}} {{political}} party, decided independently {{to pursue the}} annexation of Texas {{in a bid to}} gain a base of popular support for another four years in office. His official motivation was to outmaneuver suspected diplomatic efforts by the British government for emancipation of slaves in Texas, which would undermine slavery in the United States. Through secret negotiations with the Houston administration, Tyler secured a treaty of annexation in April 1844. When the documents were submitted to the US Senate for ratification, the details of the terms of annexation became public and the question of acquiring Texas took center stage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>election</b> of 1844.|$|E

5|$|Each state's presidential electors {{gathered}} in their state's capital on February 4, 1789 {{to cast their}} votes for the president. As originally prescribed by Article II of the Constitution, each state chose a number of electors equal to its representation in Congress. Each elector then cast two votes for president, though the electors {{were not allowed to}} cast both votes for the same person, and were prohibited from casting both their ballots for persons from their own state. The individual who won the most electoral votes would become president while the individual with the second-most electoral votes would become vice president. Each state's votes were sealed and delivered to Congress to be counted. Adams received 34 electoral college votes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>election</b> of 1789, finishing in second place behind George Washington, who garnered 69 votes.

5|$|In {{his reelection}} as the Second District congressman, Jennings {{supported}} tariff protection and internal improvements {{and vowed to}} support the presidential candidate that his constituents preferred if the election went to the House to decide the winner. Jennings won reelection to Congress in a close race, beating Jeremiah Sullivan of Madison. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>election</b> of 1824 American political parties organized around three candidates: Andrew Jackson running against John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay. Jennings favored Adams, and later, Clay; however, when the contested presidential election passed to the House in 1825, Jennings voted with the majority and gave his political support to Jackson, but he was defeated in the House and Adams became president.

5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} on December 4, 2004, Boustany defeated Mount, 55 percent to 45 percent in an election with low voter turnout. Democrats had hoped on a big turnout, as the district is nearly a quarter African American, a reliable Democratic constituency. Analysis of the race suggested that Mount's defeat was helped by the open primary system that had the Democratic candidates work against each other and led to Cravin's conflict with the state Democratic Party which in turn led to suppressed voter turnout. The large number of negative advertisements was also cited as a factor that contributed to low turnout. Another detriment for Mount mentioned was the strong support for George W. Bush <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>election</b> against John Kerry in the district, which he carried by about 60 percent of the vote.|$|E
