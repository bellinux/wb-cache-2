25|$|Some people, {{most of them}} {{inspired}} by the Seinfeld episode, subsequently began to celebrate the holiday {{with varying degrees of}} seriousness. Allen Salkin's 2005 book Festivus: The Holiday <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> chronicles the early adoption of Festivus. Rabbi Joshua Eli Plaut's book A Kosher Christmas: 'Tis the Season to Be Jewish (Rutgers University Press, 2012) references Festivus, along with hybrid holidays such as Chrismukkah.|$|E
25|$|Many other figures, like a {{great part}} of those who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars, Menelaus, and the {{historical}} pugilist Cleomedes of Astupalaea, were also believed to have been made physically immortal, but without having died in the first place. Indeed, in Greek religion, immortality originally always included an eternal union of body and soul. The philosophical idea of an immortal soul was a later invention, which, although influential, never had a breakthrough in the Greek world. As may be witnessed even into the Christian era, not least by the complaints of various philosophers over popular beliefs, traditional Greek believers maintained the conviction that certain individuals were resurrected from the dead and made physically immortal and that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> we could only look forward to an existence as disembodied and dead souls.|$|E
500|$|In August of that year, GamePro {{highlighted}} {{the advantages of}} the upcoming add-on in its 32-bit processors and significantly lower price, noting that [...] "o doubt gotta-get-it-now gamers will spend the big bucks to grab Saturn or PlayStation systems and games from Japan. [...] <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> however, 32X may well be the system of choice in '94." [...] In promotion for the new system, Sega promised 12 games available at launch and 50 games due for release in 1995 from third-party developers.|$|E

500|$|The book {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} responses from critics. R Krishna from Daily News and Analysis gave a positive review for the book. He {{observed that the}} criticism in the second book regarding bad editing and writing has been polished in The Oath of the Vayuputras. He complimented the fact that philosophical discussions {{in the book is}} rightly balanced by action sequences, commending the way in which Sati's fight with the assassins is described. Krishna concluded that the different characters of the book make it a good reading and a fitting ending to the series. Phorum Dalal from Mid Day praised the urban dialect used by Shiva in the book and felt that Tripathi's grip on the whole story is steady and has the reader's undivided attention, ultimately [...] "giving the Trilogy an end it deserves". Sanjeev Sanyal from Business Standard gave a neutral review saying that although the fast-paced and easy style from the earlier books has been retained, it is evident if one goes back and rereads the first few pages of The Immortals of Meluha that Tripathi has become much more comfortable and confident of his writing. [...] "Of course, those whose literary tastes have not outgrown Wren and Martin will still find fault with his use of the English language. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> it is delightful to see how Tripathi applies simple language to evoke great battle scenes and extraordinary landscapes".|$|E
2500|$|... {{many of the}} {{suggestions}} in Nudge seem like good ideas, and even, as with “Save More Tomorrow,” practical ones. The whole project, though, as Thaler and Sunstein acknowledge, raises some pretty awkward questions. If the “nudgee” can’t be depended on to recognize his own best interests, why stop at a nudge? Why not offer a “push,” or perhaps even a “shove”? And if people can’t be trusted {{to make the right}} choices for themselves how can they possibly be trusted to make the right decisions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us?</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the release}} of The Beautiful Letdown, the band {{temporarily}} stopped playing at Christian festivals and doing interviews with Christian organizations, as they found the speculation about their faith to be distracting from the music. Three years later, {{they went back to}} headlining at large Christian-based music festivals, and also agreed to be featured on the June 2006 cover of CCM Magazine after declining the opportunity for years. Yet in many ways they used the opportunity to describe their split from the CCM industry. This has caused some, such as Spin writer Andrew Beaujon, to take the view that [...] "their lyrics often have two different meanings, one meaning for a Christian audience and one meaning <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> They try to relate to two different groups of people at once". Jon Foreman has compared the Christian undertones of his music to the undertones of C.S. Lewis's books.|$|E

2500|$|Some reviews were negative. Thomas Lee of San Francisco Chronicle {{called it}} [...] "a mishmash of jumbled images, {{annoying}} jump cuts and pretentious philosophy/pseudo-psychobabble, the movie {{will no doubt}} appeal to hard-core fans of Godard... But <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> mortal human beings who prefer some semblance of coherence and meaningful thought, 'Goodbye to Language' will sorely disappoint." [...] Daniel Engber of Slate criticized the film's incoherent plot but praised its 3D innovations. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post called it a [...] "snooze fest" [...] and wrote that Godard was [...] "a cranky 83-year-old bore pretentiously lecturing on cinema and {{the world in a}} private language only film critics and Upper West Side audiences pretend to understand at this point." [...] Marc Mohan of The Oregonian called it [...] "a dense collage of sound and image, without a coherent narrative, that deconstructs cinema and history in provocative and often incomprehensible ways." ...|$|E
2500|$|Switchfoot {{is often}} {{referred}} to as a [...] "Christian band", mostly due to their involvement with the Christian rock scene in their early days. But the band has always shunned this label: [...] "For us, it's a faith, not a genre,..." [...] says Jon Foreman. [...] "...these songs are for everyone. Calling us 'Christian rock' tends to be a box that closes some people out and excludes them. And that's not what we're trying to do. Music has always opened my mind—and that's what we want". Duly, Foreman's lyrics steer clear of preachiness, exclusive declarations of faith, or even any mention of Jesus Christ, instead questioning the status quo, probing existential issues through [...] "Socratic dialogue" [...] in which he answers questions with more questions, exploring frustrations, or simply being inspirational. Even so, this position has not alienated their Christian fans. As in their indie days, they are still distributed to Christian retail outlets through Sparrow Records, featured on Christian radio and charts, and presented Dove Awards, even after having been signed to the mainstream Columbia Records. Spin writer Andrew Beaujon takes the view that [...] "their lyrics often have two different meanings, one meaning for a Christian audience and one meaning <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> They try to relate to two different groups of people at once".|$|E
2500|$|Reviews of Brothers in Arms {{from the}} UK music press were {{generally}} negative. In a scathing review for NME, Mat Snow said, [...] "Dire Straits are so tasteful {{as to be}} entirely flavourless, so laid back as to bore me horizontal". He continued, [...] "So do you seriously {{want to hear about}} the further adventures of Mark Knopfler's mawkish self-pity, his lugubriously mannered appropriation of rockin' Americana, his thumpingly crass attempts at wit? Can anybody really be moved, stimulated or entertained by the tritest would-be melodies in history, the last word in tranquilising chord changes, the most cloying lonesome playing and ultimate in transparently fake troubador sentiment ever to ooze out of a million-dollar recording studio?" [...] Eleanor Levy of Record Mirror was similarly dismissive, succinctly stating, [...] "West Coast guitars reeking of mega bucks and sell out stadium concerts throughout the globe. Laid back melodies. Dire Straits – summed up... This is like any other Dire Straits album quarried out of the tottering edifice of MOR rock." [...] The reviews from the UK's other two music papers were less harsh, with Jack Barron of Sounds feeling that [...] "it's only a halfway decent album because it has only halfway decent songs... Knopfler has distilled his sonic essence, via blues, to appeal to billboard romantics with cinemascope insecurities. And he can pull it off well... but not often enough here." [...] Melody Makers Barry McIlheney observed that Knopfler had recently explored different creative directions with his work on movie soundtracks and on Bob Dylan's Infidels, and bemoaned that [...] "unfortunately <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> this admirable spirit of adventure fails to materialise when it comes to Brothers in Arms. Instead it sounds just a bit too like the last Dire Straits album, which sounded not unlike the last one before that, which sounded suspiciously like the beginning of a hugely successful and very lucrative plan to take over the world known as AOR... the old rockschool restraints and the undeniably attractive smell of the winning formula seem to block out any such experimental work and what you end up with is something very like the same old story." ...|$|E
