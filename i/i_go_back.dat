25|$|In early 2013, Ringwald {{released}} Except Sometimes, a jazz record. It {{follows a}} tradition in jazz for the Ringwald family set by her father. “I {{grew up in a}} home filled with music and had an early appreciation of jazz since my dad was a jazz musician. Beginning at around age three I started singing with his band and jazz music has continued to be one of my three passions along with acting and writing. I like to say jazz music is my musical equivalent of comfort food. It's always where <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to when I want to feel grounded,” Ringwald said in a statement.|$|E
25|$|When evening comes, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> home, {{and go to}} my study. On the threshold, I {{take off}} my work clothes, covered in mud and filth, and I put on the clothes an {{ambassador}} would wear. Decently dressed, I enter the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died. There, I am warmly welcomed, and I feed on the only food I find nourishing and was born to savour. I am not ashamed {{to talk to them}} and ask them to explain their actions and they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety. I forget every worry. I am no longer afraid of poverty or frightened of death. I live entirely through them.|$|E
500|$|Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives {{was named}} {{as one of}} the best albums of 2001 by several publications, {{including}} Pitchfork, Ottawa Citizen and Rolling Stone. The Globe & Mail named it the seventh best album of the year, with Carl Wilson writing that [...] "of all the electronica-glich-IDM this year, [...] is the only one <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to as if it were the Rolling Stones." [...] In 2005, Pitchfork ranked the album the 84th best of 2000-2004. Herren was overwhelmed with the positive reception the album received, exclaiming that [...] "Most of it was so positive, but I'd also get a really strong reaction from people- some that want to kill me, 'cause they're under the impression that I'm trying to kill hip hop or something, and I'm like 'uh see ya, whatever man.'" ...|$|E

500|$|American Pharoah's {{pedigree}} includes horses {{adept at}} classic race distances on his sire's side and endowed with speed on his dam's side. Sire [...] the Nile won the Santa Anita Derby and ran {{second in the}} 2009 Kentucky Derby, {{with all of his}} wins at distances of [...] miles or more. Prior to American Pharoah, Pioneerof the Nile had sired five other winners of stakes races of a mile or more in his relatively new career as a stallion. Trainer Bob Baffert observed that Pioneerof the Nile also raced with [...] "a big, long stride" [...] and had [...] "that same springing motion as American Pharoah, whose acceleration is pretty remarkable." [...] He also praised Pioneerof the Nile's dam, Star of Goshen: [...] "She was a freaky filly, really, really fast." [...] To Baffert, American Pharoah's bloodline is a source of fascination: [...] "Every time I work him, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and look at the pedigree, and I go, What is going on here?" ...|$|E

Someday I might have to put down a basketball and have a regular 9-to-5 like everybody else." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the riots, on 9 August 2011, UK Home Secretary Theresa May said: [...] "I {{think this}} is about sheer criminality. That {{is what we have}} seen on the streets. The {{violence}} we've seen, the looting we've seen, the thuggery we've seen – this is sheer criminality, and let's make no bones about it." [...] Paul Hobbs, London correspondent for One News said that looters are not politically motivated and called the riots [...] "recreational violence". A Manchester rioter said to a BBC correspondent: [...] "Every time I go into town I just think how the shops got smashed up in 2011 by all of us, I just laugh about it every time <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> in now." ...|$|E

2500|$|The No. 88, {{according}} to NASCAR archives, {{was driven by}} Ralph Earnhardt, his paternal grandfather, in 1957. His maternal grandfather, Robert Gee, {{was one of the}} first employees of All Star Racing, initially a Late Model Sportsman (now Xfinity Series) team with Gee as Hendrick's partner, which is now Hendrick Motorsports. Hendrick said about Earnhardt and his uncles, [...] "I can look at Robert Gee Jr., or Jimmy Gee, or Dale Jr., and all I see is Robert Gee. They're the spitting image of him. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and look and pictures from when we did things together, and I have to say, I owe Robert a lot." [...] Starting in the 2008 season, Hendrick Motorsports merged its Nationwide Series team to Earnhardt's JR Motorsports, with the cars coming from Earnhardt's shop, which employs his mother and uncles.|$|E
2500|$|In an October 2007 {{preliminary}} hearing {{for the case}} of Dr. Maurice Wolin, Dr. Wolin's attorney Blair Berk argued that Perverted Justice's founder has a financial incentive to badger suspects. Von Erck testified in the hearing that he is paid an annual salary of $120,000 stemming from Perverted Justice's deal with NBC. Said Berk, [...] "Xavier Von Erck had a problem. He had a television show to get on and a fancy cancer doctor to ensnare in his web, and he wouldn't let it go." [...] The prosecutor in the case, Brian Staebell, stated, [...] "The whole business of this {{preliminary hearing}} has been {{an attack on the}} Petaluma Police Department and Perverted Justice. But every time <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the chats and I look at how he was grooming this 13-year-old girl." [...] After the hearing, Judge Raima Ballinger held Wolin over for trial, ruling that there was sufficient cause to believe Wolin committed the crime.|$|E
2500|$|Zander Hollander, {{who wrote}} The Complete Handbook of Pro Football, said about Gradishar, [...] "Not as nasty as Butkus, doesn't snarl like Lambert, but Gradishar {{makes all the}} plays. Hey, he can hit, too. Just ask Saints' Henry Childs, after Gradishar knocked his helmet off, [...] "It {{was the first in}} my career like that, in the open field". Gradishar's hitting ability was a {{sentiment}} echoed in Rick Korch's book, The Truly Great. In it, Tony Dorsett recalled the hit Gradishar gave him in a 1980 game, [...] "I ran a pass pattern and was wide open but Danny White did not see me. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the huddle and tell Danny that I am wide open. I ran the same route again but this time I was almost decapitated. My eyes were only partially open when I hit the ground. Trainers and doctors came running onto the field. They thought I was dead. Hey, I thought I was dead, too." [...] Hall of Fame defensive lineman Dan Hampton remembers asking Walter Payton, [...] "Walter, who gave you the hardest hit you ever took in the NFL?". According to Hampton, Payton replied, [...] "Randy Gradishar, 1978". In 1981 SPORT magazine named Gradishar one of the Top 5 hardest hitters in the NFL, quoting the modest Gradishar, [...] "The chance for a real good shot comes very seldom, but when it's there I take full advantage of it".|$|E

2500|$|When Taishi Ci {{finally reached}} Luoyang after {{travelling}} day and night, {{he saw the}} provincial administration's courier near the city gate. He approached him and asked, [...] "Sir, are you delivering a document?" [...] The courier replied, [...] "Yes." [...] Taishi Ci asked again, [...] "Where is the document?" [...] The courier replied, [...] "In the carriage." [...] Taishi Ci said, [...] "Are you sure there is no mistake in the addressee's details on the document? Let me see it." [...] The courier {{did not know that}} Taishi Ci was from Donglai Commandery so he showed him the letter. Taishi Ci took out a knife and destroyed the letter. The courier started shouting, [...] "This man destroyed my document!" [...] Taishi Ci pulled him into the carriage and said, [...] "If you didn't show me the document, I wouldn't have been able to destroy it. Regardless of the consequences, neither of us can say he is not responsible for what happened. I suggest we remain silent and escape. By doing this, we can avoid punishment and keep our heads. Otherwise, both of us will be executed." [...] The courier asked, [...] "Your master sent you to destroy this document. Now that you have accomplished your mission, why do you still need to go on the run?" [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "He ordered me to only check whether the document has been delivered. However, I went too far and ended up destroying the document. If <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> I am afraid that my master will blame me, so I suggest we escape together." [...] The courier was persuaded by Taishi Ci so they fled from Luoyang together.|$|E
2500|$|He {{focused on}} his {{opposition}} to abortion and gun control, {{as well as his}} support for lower taxes and free-market health care solutions. [...] He told the CPAC audience that he arrived in Washington as [...] "a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution", and addressed the issue of illegal immigration - one of the major issues where conservatives have attacked McCain. He said that [...] "it would be among my highest priorities to secure our borders first", before addressing other immigration laws. [...] Mike Huckabee spoke to CPAC two days later and said, [...] "I know that there was some speculation that I might come here today to announce that I would be getting out of the race. But I {{want to make sure you}} understand. Am I quitting? Well, let's get that settled right now. No, I'm not. And the reason is simple—I never learned arithmetic. You see folks, while I didn't get a college degree in mathematics and writing, I majored in miracles. Mathematically impossible miracles. It is because <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to that which helped crystallize in me a conservative viewpoint as a teenager when it wasn't easy or popular to be a Republican or a conservative in my hometown, because I do believe that America is about making choices, not simply echoing that of others. Let others join the [...] "Me, too" [...] crowd. But I didn't get where I am today and I didn't fight the battles in a state that, when I became its governor, was 90 percent Democrat, by simply echoing the voices of others. I did it by staking out a choice, stating that choice, making that choice and fighting for that choice, to believe that some things were right, some things were wrong, and it's better to be right and even to not win than it is to be wrong and to be a part of the crowd." ...|$|E
