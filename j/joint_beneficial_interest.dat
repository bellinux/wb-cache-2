40|$|The article {{seeks to}} {{examine the effect of}} a {{severance}} of a <b>joint</b> <b>beneficial</b> title following the House of Lords' ruling in Stack v Dowden [2007] 2 AC 432. If, under Stack, the parties' <b>beneficial</b> <b>interests</b> fall to be treated as identical to their legal interests (in effect, giving rise to a joint tenancy both at law and in equity), how does the mechanism of severance of a <b>joint</b> <b>beneficial</b> tenancy actually operate so as to give rise to separate and unequal shares where the parties' common intention has changed by virtue of post-acquisition events? The question is examined by reference to an ambulatory and new constructive trust, as well as where the parties have entered into an express declaration of trust of their <b>beneficial</b> <b>interests...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Court of Appeal {{overturned}} the High Court and ordered that the net proceeds be divided 65 per cent {{to her and}} 35 per cent to Mr Stack. The declaration as to the receipt for capital money in the transfer document could not be taken as an express declaration of trust, nor could it infer an intention that the beneficial ownership be equal, {{because there was no}} evidence that either of them had understood the declaration to carry such significance. The issues were whether a conveyance into joint names established a prima facie case of <b>joint</b> and equal <b>beneficial</b> <b>interests</b> and whether the Court of Appeal had been correct to overrule the judge's order that Ms Dowden compensate Mr Stack for the cost of his accommodation.

5000|$|Lord Millett's {{analysis}} of the Quistclose trust closely mirrored the same approach he had suggested twenty years earlier {{in an article in}} the Law Quarterly Review. He suggested there are four possible answers to the question of the nature of a Quistclose trust. The <b>beneficial</b> <b>interest</b> could lie with (1) the lender, (2) the borrower, (3) an ultimate purpose, and (4) no-one, in the sense that the <b>beneficial</b> <b>interest</b> remains [...] "in suspense". The <b>beneficial</b> <b>interest</b> could not remain in suspense, a purpose trust would be void under English law, and if the borrower held the <b>beneficial</b> <b>interest</b> the remaining money could not go back to the lender. So, Lord Millett concluded that the <b>beneficial</b> <b>interest</b> must remain with the lender, until the purpose for which the funds are lent is fulfilled on [...] "resulting trust". By contrast, Lord Hoffmann characterised the trust as being an express, rather than a resulting trust. Although there may not have been words used to this effect, the solicitor's undertaking that the money should only be used for one purpose so that the money is not at the borrower's free disposal, was sufficient intent to create a trust.|$|R

5000|$|The key issue, {{according}} to Lord Millett, in upholding the trust concept is ascertaining where the <b>beneficial</b> <b>interest</b> {{in the money}} lies.

Lord Millett then analysed all of the foregoing, and determined that the <b>beneficial</b> <b>interest</b> remains with the lender, until the purpose for which the funds are lent is fulfilled. The only other reasoned decision was Lord Hoffmann, who agreed with Lord Millett, though disagreed as to whether it was an express or resulting trust.|$|R
