40|$|Hot {{embossing}} is {{an effective}} technology for reproducing micro-scale features in polymeric materials, but large-scale adoption of this method is hindered by high capital costs and low cycle times relative to other technologies, and {{a general lack of}} manufacturing equipment. This work details a hot <b>embossing</b> <b>machine</b> design strategy motivated by maximum production speed and quality with minimal capital cost. The approach is to "right-size" the machine for specific product needs while making the design flexible and scalable. Toward this end, a minimal number of components were used, commercially available off-the-shelf components were chosen where possible, system layout was designed to be modular, and system size was scaled for the intended products (in this case microfluidic devices). Innovative design aspects include the use of new ceramic substrate heaters for electrical heating, use of a moveable heat sink to minimize heat load during the heating cycle, and the careful design of the thermal elements to minimize the heating and cooling cycle times. The capital cost and the cost per part produced with this machine are estimated to be an order of magnitude less than currently available hot embossing manufacturing options. The hot <b>embossing</b> <b>machine</b> has been tested extensively to characterize the process variability. The minimum cycle time is two minutes, and microstructures are replicated within a maximum of a 25 mm by 75 mm area with very low relative variance in dimensions. by Melinda Hale. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|A {{machine was}} {{designed}} to pattern thin films of liquid by liquid embossing. 10 designs were prototyped and evaluated according to pattern transfer, alignment, and ability to emboss large area. The final design utilizes a PDMS stamp cast such that it seals an air cavity, which is then pressurized to slightly bow the stamp. The cavity is clear so alignment {{can be accomplished by}} optical feedback using a camera and microscope objective. The theory of liquid embossing is discussed. PDMS has a very high contact angle with most fluids and so it is able to clear liquid from channels approximately 5 [mu]m wide. The wettability of the substrate is modified after being in contact with PDMS so the liquid does not reflow into the channels. Sub-micron alignment between layers was achieved. Vector plots of runout between layers are given. Electrical yield was found to be 89 % and was not negatively correlated by stamp age up to 1000 dry stamps. The stamps were found to wear, but due to their conformal nature this did not affect pattern transfer.

This enabled the system to be run {{in a state of}} statistical control, which in turn allowed for a designed experiment to be done on the system. This designed experiment determined that the forming temperature, forming force, forming time, as well as the square terms for the forming temperature and forming force and the cross-terms of forming force with forming temperature and forming time with forming temperature, were all statistically significant in the formation of parts. With this data, cycle-to-cycle control can be enabled in the future. by Katharine Luginbuhl. Thesis: S. M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, 2014.

A 10 - micron ridge is adjacent to the channel. Several measurement methods were evaluated with gage repeatability and reproducibility studies to determine the methods most capable of quantifying the quality of embossed parts. The end determination was that quality of parts should be defined by the completeness of formation of the ridge lining the channel. The height and width measurements of the ridge were used as quality metrics. The precision to tolerance ratio (P/T ratio) of the measurement method used for finding ridge height was found to be 0. 44 and the P/T ratio of the ridge width measurement method was found to be 0. 33. by Nicholas Ragosta.

40|$|Microfluidic {{technologies}} hold a {{great deal}} of promise in advancing the medical field, but transitioning them from research to commercial production has proven problematic. We propose precision hot embossing as a process to produce high volumes of devices with low capital cost and a high degree of flexibility. Hot embossing has not been widely applied to precision forming of hard polymers at viable production rates. To this end we have developed experimental equipment capable of maintaining the necessary precision in forming parameters while minimizing cycle time. In addition, since equipment precision alone does not guarantee consistent product quality, our work also focuses on real-time sensing and diagnosis of the process. This paper covers both the basic details for a novel <b>embossing</b> <b>machine,</b> and the utilization of the force and displacement data acquired during the embossing cycle to diagnose the state of the material and process. The precision necessary in both the forming machine and the instrumentation will be covered in detail. It will be shown that variation in the material properties (e. g. thickness, glass transition temperature) as well as the degree of bulk deformation of the substrate can be detected from these measurements. If these data are correlated with subsequent downstream functional tests, a total measure of quality may be determined and used to apply closed-loop cycle-to-cycle control to the entire process. By incorporating automation and specialized precision equipment into a tabletop “microfactory” setting, we aim to demonstrate a high degree of process control and disturbance rejection for the process of hot embossing as applied at the micron scale.

40|$|Hot {{embossing}} is {{a growing}} technology proven {{to be capable of}} reproducing micro-scale features on thermoplastics and can be an effective process for rapid prototyping microfluidic devices with high aspect ratio micro features. Advantages of this manufacturing process can include tooling flexibility, fast production time, low capital cost and a vast selection of production materials. A greater understanding on the micro feature transferring capabilities and use limits of tools are needed so that hot embossing may advance to becoming a practical technique for producing microfluidic parts. This work focuses on both the design and analysis of a hot embossing system and a brass tool to replicate an existing functional high aspect ratio micro feature onto Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The aspect ratio of features ranged from 10 : 1 to 4, 000 : 1. Optimal embossing parameters used a pressure of 3. 5 kN, hold time of 12 minutes, tool temperatures of 140 °C and substrate temperature of 130 °C to produce parts that filled shoulder heights and widths up to 97 % and 90 %, respectively. The wearing of features on the metal tool were also characterized for purposes of understanding the limits on tool use and was found that a maximum range of +/- 3 [mu]m in dimensional change existed. Gains in tool dimensions were then mainly attributed to the deposition of embossed materials onto the tool. The study further determined a method for creating usable resin tool copies that exhibited a replication accuracy of less than 2 %, on average, for micron size features. by Khanh H. Nguyen.

40|$|Micro {{embossing}} is {{the process}} of fabricating micron-sized features by plastic deformation of a work piece by means of a shaped tool or die. In our work we are concerned with hot embossing of PMMA to produce features in the 1 - 100 µm range, suited for micro fluidic and photonic product requirements. As with any deformation process, hot micro embossing yields products with dimensional variation. In ideal situations, several products can be manufactured repeatedly with the same machine settings and be expected to be exactly the same in every aspect with each other. In reality, final products from the same process might have variations in dimensions and material properties even if the machine settings are kept constant. These can be natural variations of the process or variations caused by external disturbances. Variations can decrease the yield of a manufacturing process and can also restrict the ultimate level of product precision attainable. Manufacturing process control entails the study of the origins of process variations and the use of this knowledge to reduce this variation under production conditions. Manufacturing process control is thus vital in establishing the ultimate cost, quality, rate and flexibility of any manufacturing process. Thus, we are interested in controlling inputs that have a direct effect on the work piece’s final shape and thus the productivity. For hot embossing of PMMA, we are interested in controlling: (1) the temperature of the die and work piece during the entire forming process (forming & cooling), (2) the rate of cooling of the die and substrate, (3) die and substrate platen displacement and displacement rate, (4) force applied on the platen and distribution of this force. The temperature needs to be controlled as it affects the thermo-mechanical behavior of the PMMA. The forming temperature determines the forming properties of the material, the rate of cooling will affect the amount of shrinkage and thermal stresses that the polymer work piece undergoes. The displacement will affect the flow of the material into the die and this will affect the feature size and depths to be embossed. The displacement rate will affect the non-Newtonian polymeric material flow rate into the cavity. It is imperative to carefully control those inputs to minimize variations in forming behavior and final product dimension and properties. An experimental lab scale micro <b>embossing</b> <b>machine</b> to address the needs was designed and fabricated at the Manufacturing Process Control Lab (MPCL) at MIT. An Instron Model 5869 Table mounted materials testing system of capacity 50 KN (11250 lb) was chosen as the platform for the apparatus and it was modified to accept the forming platens with temperature controllers which have capability of controlling the temperatures of the substrate and master to +/- 1 degree Celsius accuracy. The controller powers 2 x 200 watt heaters that can heat the platens to 150 Celsius in 8 minutes. The Instron has a test speed range of 1 micron to 500 mm/min (0. 00004 in/min to 20 in/min) with a 50 KN load cell attached to the platen with an accuracy of +/- 1 N. The platen cooling system uses water where flow rate will vary the resulting cooling rate. To ensure even heating of the substrate, shape factor analysis was used {{in the design of the}} copper platens. The shape factor analysis reveals the heat flow patterns and regions of isotherm within the platens originating from the cartridge heaters and thus using this information, the platens can be designed to have the cartridge heaters located so as to minimize temperature variation of the surface of the platen. The apparatus has been used so far to study hot embossing of sub-millimeter sized features using a copper master on a 1 mm thick PMMA material. This presentation will provide greater details on the design of the machine, its initial performance tests and some preliminary process variation experiments. Singapore-MIT Alliance (SMA...|$|E
