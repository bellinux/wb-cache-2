I think the obvious route is the Geoffrey Watling stand, whether you put another layer on it or take it down and re-build, I don't know. Probably the sensible {{thing to do is}} bite the bullet, take it down and build a new stand, but it means 18 to 24 months without revenue and the people in that stand tend to be {{the people who have been}} the supporters for many generations.|$|E
25|$|Wally Terzinsky (Scott Thompson) is a husband, father, and closeted homosexual. Wally masturbates to gay pornography, frequents {{public bath}} houses, and was sexually active with men during his {{military}} service – but remains unaware of his sexual orientation. He is prescribed GLeeMONEX by a frustrated therapist, (Dave Foley) ("You're gay. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> your family knows it... dogs know it!"). His happiest memory is a homoerotic Army mission fantasized by Wally while being chewed out by his drill instructor (Mark McKinney). Wally finds himself standing considerably {{closer to his}} drill instructor when through fantasizing. Shortly after this, he finally admits (via song and dance) {{that he is in}} fact homosexual. The character is an obvious variation on the TV show's dimwitted Danny Husk (Kevin McDonald as his wife in both the movie and series).|$|E

500|$|He {{conceived}} it in 2001 and NBC ordered 13 episodes {{the following}} year; the show's original pilot used a single-camera setup but NBC executives {{felt it would}} have more appeal as a multiple-camera setup, so it was re-shot. Appel noted of the show: [...] "There's a sense sometimes in Hollywood that writers and producers who come from animated shows maybe have something to prove to justify their credibility as live-action show-runners or writers. My own experience has been fortunate. I haven't felt that. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> exists." [...] The show was not acclaimed: Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said it was [...] "too cartoonish to work."

500|$|Al Kooper {{recalled}} {{that both the}} album title, Blonde on Blonde, and song titles arrived during the mixing sessions.

Free association and silliness, I'm sure, played a big role." [...] Another Dylan chronicler, Oliver Trager, notes that besides spelling out the initials of Dylan's first name, the album title is also a riff on Brecht on Brecht, a stage production based on works by German playwright Bertolt Brecht that had influenced his early songwriting. Dylan himself has said of the title: [...] "Well, I don't even recall exactly how it came up, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> was all in good faith... I don't know who thought of that. I certainly didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{types of}} new and old music {{are used in the}} show. Older songs are given a modern remix with a pop/rock arrangement.

500|$|Story editor Frank Spotnitz {{said of the}} episode, [...] "I love 'Paper Clip'.

I think it is more exciting to go at rocket speed. Everybody was on the mark in that one; David and Gillian's performances, Rob Bowman's direction, Chris Carter's writing—everything was just terrific in that show". Bowman said [...] "When I finished 'Paper Clip', I thought, 'I don't know what else I am going to do this year to top this'" [...] In 1996 Mitch Pileggi called the episode one of the show's finest, particularly enjoying the line where he tells The Smoking Man to [...] "pucker up and kiss my ass". Pileggi claims that is one of his favorite lines. The scene was used frequently to introduce him at X-Files conventions.|$|E
500|$|Veronica Mars {{was also}} {{positively}} received by other writers.

Seriously, I've never gotten more wrapped up in a show I wasn't making, and maybe even more than those [...] These guys know what they're doing on a level that intimidates me. It's the Harry Potter of shows." [...] Kevin Smith, who guest starred in the episode [...] "Driver Ed", said that Veronica Mars was [...] "hands-down, the best show on television right now, and proof that TV can be far better than cinema." [...] Stephen King described the series as [...] "Nancy Drew meets Philip Marlowe, and the result is pure nitro. Why is Veronica Mars so good? It bears little resemblance to life as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> but I can't take my eyes off the damn thing." [...] Ed Brubaker called it [...] "the best mystery show ever made in America." ...|$|E
500|$|The debate {{highlighted}} disagreements between {{openly gay}} lawmakers and some black lawmakers on whether same-sex {{marriage is a}} matter of civil rights. Delegate Emmett C. Burns, Jr. said: [...] "If you want to compare same-sex marriage to civil rights as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> show me the Ku Klux Klan that invaded your home." [...] Delegate Keiffer J. Mitchell, Jr., grandson of NAACP chief lobbyist Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr., said [...] "It is a civil rights issue when we as a state and a government deny equal protection under the law." [...] Several delegates who originally co-sponsored the bill began to express doubts after being lobbied by church-going constituents, including Sam Arora and Tiffany Alston, who delayed the bill's vote in the House committee by skipping the voting session. The bill passed through the committee after its chairman, who rarely votes in committee, voted in favor. The House majority whip opposed the bill. Despite pleas from gay lawmakers, the House of Delegates voted to send the bill back to committee on March 11, 2011 and would not reconsider it before January 2012.|$|E
