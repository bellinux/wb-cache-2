5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma {{can affect}} any {{area of the}} bile <b>ducts,</b> either within or outside the liver. Tumors {{occurring}} in the bile <b>ducts</b> within the liver {{are referred to as}} intrahepatic, those occurring in the <b>ducts</b> outside the liver are extrahepatic, and tumors occurring at the site where the bile <b>ducts</b> exit the liver may be referred to as perihilar. A cholangiocarcinoma occurring at the junction where the left and right hepatic <b>ducts</b> meet to form the common hepatic duct may be referred to eponymously as a Klatskin tumor.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{physical}} indications of cholangiocarcinoma are abnormal liver function tests, jaundice (yellowing {{of the eyes}} and skin occurring when bile <b>ducts</b> are blocked by tumor), abdominal pain (30%–50%), generalized itching (66%), weight loss (30%–50%), fever (up to 20%), {{and changes in the}} color of stool or urine. To some extent, the symptoms depend upon the location of the tumor: patients with cholangiocarcinoma in the extrahepatic bile <b>ducts</b> (outside the liver) {{are more likely to have}} jaundice, while those with tumors of the bile <b>ducts</b> within the liver more often have pain without jaundice.|$|E
5|$|As a {{component}} of the female reproductive system, the cervix is derived from the two paramesonephric <b>ducts</b> (also called Müllerian <b>ducts),</b> which develop around the sixth week of embryogenesis. During development, the outer parts of the two <b>ducts</b> fuse, forming a single urogenital canal that will become the vagina, cervix and uterus. The cervix grows in size at a smaller rate than the body of the uterus, so the relative size of the cervix over time decreases, decreasing from being much larger than the body of the uterus in fetal life, twice as large during childhood, and decreasing to its adult size, smaller than the uterus, after puberty. Previously it was thought that during fetal development, the original squamous epithelium of the cervix is derived from the urogenital sinus and the original columnar epithelium is derived from the paramesonephric duct. The point at which these two original epithelia meet is called the original squamocolumnar junction. New studies show, however, that all the cervical as well as large part of the vaginal epithelium are derived from Müllerian duct tissue and that phenotypic differences might be due to other causes.|$|E
50|$|The common hepatic <b>duct</b> is the <b>duct</b> {{formed by}} the {{convergence}} of the right hepatic <b>duct</b> (which drains bile from the right functional lobe of the liver) and the left hepatic <b>duct</b> (which drains bile from the left functional lobe of the liver). The common hepatic <b>duct</b> then joins the cystic <b>duct</b> coming from the gallbladder to form the common bile <b>duct.</b> The <b>duct</b> is usually 6-8 cm length.|$|R
40|$|Endoscopic {{manometry}} {{was used}} to measure pancreatic <b>duct,</b> common bile <b>duct,</b> pancreatic <b>duct</b> sphincter and bile <b>duct</b> sphincter pressures in 43 healthy volunteers and 162 patients with a variety of papillary, pancreatic and biliary disorders. Common bile <b>duct</b> pressure was significantly raised after cholecystectomy, with common bile <b>duct</b> stones and papillary stenosis but pancreatic <b>duct</b> pressure only in papillary stenosis. After endoscopic sphincterotomy mean common bile <b>duct</b> pressure fell from 11. 2 to 1. 1 mmHg and pancreatic <b>duct</b> pressure from 18. 0 to 11. 2 mmHg. Distinct pancreatic <b>duct</b> sphincter and bile <b>duct</b> sphincter zones were identified as phasic pressures of 3 - 12 waves/minute on pull-through from pancreatic <b>duct</b> and common bile <b>duct</b> to duodenum. Pancreatic <b>duct</b> sphincter pressures were higher with common bile <b>duct</b> stones and stenosis whereas bile <b>duct</b> sphincter pressures were higher in pancreatitis and stenosis. Bile <b>duct</b> sphincter activity was present in 60 % of patients after surgical sphincteroplasty but 21 % of patients after endoscopic sphincterotomy. Endoscopic manometry facilitated the diagnosis of papillary stenosis, has allowed study of papillary pathophysiology and has shown a functional inter-relationship between the two sphincteric zones...|$|R

5|$|Some teams {{modified}} {{their cars}} {{in preparation for}} the event. Red Bull and Williams revised their brake <b>ducts.</b> Williams team changed their brake <b>ducts</b> at the front to improve airflow inside the tyres and direct the duct towards their car's central section more efficiently. Red Bull's brake <b>ducts,</b> which had been changed for the third consecutive Grand Prix, reintroduced a small fin seen at the Singapore Grand Prix; for Korea two aerodynamic fins were fitted and a larger duct was introduced. McLaren modified a version of their front wings first introduced in Singapore. The team added a vertical gurney flap and an additional vertical slot at the front wing endplate to improve airflow outside the front tyres and increase the amount of downforce and therefore grip produced by the bodywork. The team also brought a new rear wing and tested a new revision of their F-duct system that débuted at the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka. Ferrari revised their diffuser with curved profiles and one large middle plate designed to improve the extraction of air {{from the bottom of the}} F10. As in Suzuka, Toro Rosso ran an F-duct system in the Friday practice sessions.|$|E

5000|$|The {{intercalated}} <b>duct,</b> {{also called}} intercalary duct(ducts of Boll), is {{the portion of}} an exocrine gland leading directly from the acinus to a striated <b>duct.</b> The intercalated <b>duct</b> forms part of the intralobular <b>duct.</b> This <b>duct</b> has the thinnest epithelium of {{any part of the}} <b>duct</b> system, and the epithelium is usually classified as [...] "low" [...] simple cuboidal.|$|R
5|$|Unlike the B-1A, the B-1B cannot reach Mach2+ speeds; {{its maximum}} speed is Mach1.25 (about 950mph or 1,530km/h at altitude), but its {{low-level}} speed increased to Mach0.92 (700mph, 1,130km/h). The {{speed of the}} current version of the aircraft is limited by the need to avoid damage to its structure and air intakes. To help lower its radar cross section (RCS), the B-1B uses serpentine air intake <b>ducts</b> (see S-duct) and fixed intake ramps, which limit its speed compared to the B-1A. Vanes in the intake <b>ducts</b> serve to deflect and shield radar emissions from the highly reflective engine compressor blades.|$|E
5|$|While {{the layout}} of {{internal}} genital <b>ducts</b> and openings of the female genitalia depends upon the taxonomic group that insect belongs to, the internal female reproductive system of all lepidopterans consists of paired ovaries and accessory glands which produce the yolks and shells of the eggs. Female insects have a system of receptacles and <b>ducts</b> in which sperm is received, transported and stored. The oviducts of the female join {{together to form a}} common duct (called the 'oviductus communis') which leads to the vagina.|$|E

5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma, {{also known}} as bile duct cancer, {{is a form of}} cancer that is {{composed}} of mutated epithelial cells (or cells showing characteristics of epithelial differentiation) that originate in the bile <b>ducts</b> which drain bile from the liver into the small intestine.

5|$|For {{surgical}} cases, {{the odds}} of cure {{vary depending on the}} tumor location and whether the tumor can be completely, or only partially, removed. Distal cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the common bile duct) are generally treated surgically with a Whipple procedure; long-term survival rates range from 15%–25%, although one series reported a five-year survival of 54% for patients with no involvement of the lymph nodes. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the bile <b>ducts</b> within the liver) are usually treated with partial hepatectomy. Various series have reported survival estimates after surgery ranging from 22%–66%; the outcome may depend on involvement of lymph nodes and completeness of the surgery. Perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (those occurring near where the bile <b>ducts</b> exit the liver) are least likely to be operable. When surgery is possible, they are generally treated with an aggressive approach often including removal of the gallbladder and potentially part of the liver. In patients with operable perihilar tumors, reported 5-year survival rates range from 20%–50%.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with cholestatic liver {{function}} tests and histological features of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) but a normal cholangiogram {{are considered to}} have small <b>duct</b> PSC. The natural history of this condition is unknown. METHODS: Thirty three patients with small <b>duct</b> PSC were identified among patients admitted for diagnostic workup of cholestatic {{liver function}} tests in one centre in the UK (Oxford) and one centre in Norway (Oslo). A total of 260 patients with large <b>duct</b> PSC were compared, and prognosis in terms of death, cholangiocarcinoma, biochemical features, histological features, and symptoms analysed. RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis was 38 years and 39 years in small <b>duct</b> and large <b>duct</b> PSC, respectively. Mean follow up was 106 months in small <b>duct</b> and 105 months in large <b>duct</b> patients. Four patients originally considered to have small <b>duct</b> developed large <b>duct</b> PSC. Two of these underwent liver transplantation during follow up. Of the remainder who did not develop large <b>duct</b> PSC, two patients died during follow up: one of liver failure and the other of cardiac death unrelated to her liver disease. A total of 122 (47 %) large <b>duct</b> patients either required liver transplantation (34 patients) or died (88 patients). Small <b>duct</b> patients had a significantly better survival compared with large <b>duct</b> patients. Among small <b>duct</b> patients, none developed cholangiocarcinoma compared with 28 of 260 (11 %) large <b>duct</b> patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with small <b>duct</b> PSC {{seem to have a}} good prognosis in terms of survival and development of cholangiocarcinoma. Small <b>duct</b> PSC progresses to large <b>duct</b> PSC in a small proportion of patients...|$|R

5|$|The strepsirrhine rhinarium {{can collect}} {{relatively}} non-volatile, fluid-based chemicals (traditionally categorized as pheromones) and transmit {{them to the}} vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is located below {{and in front of}} the nasal cavity, above the mouth. The VNO is an encased duct-like structure made of cartilage and is isolated from the air passing through the nasal cavity. The VNO is connected to the mouth through nasopalatine <b>ducts</b> (which communicate via the incisive foramen), which pass through the hard palate at the top, front of the mouth. Fluids traveling from the rhinarium to the mouth and then up the nasopalatine <b>ducts</b> to the VNO are detected, and information is relayed to the accessory olfactory bulb, which is relatively large in strepsirrhines. From the accessory olfactory bulb, information is sent to the amygdala, which handles emotions, and then to the hypothalamus, which handles basic body functions and metabolic processes. This neural pathway differs from that used by the main olfactory system.|$|E
