5|$|Growth is slow, and the veligers {{are carried}} by the ocean {{currents}} for up to 14 weeks. As the veligers mature, they develop their first shell (the smooth protoconch) and turn <b>into</b> <b>very</b> small juvenile snails, at which point they sink to the ocean floor. As {{is the case in}} all shelled mollusks, the mantle is what secretes the shell; shell growth begins at what will later become the apex of the shell, and typically rotates clockwise. As the animal gradually matures, the mantle continues to secrete shell material. Scotch bonnets complete maturation in one to six years. However, some have lived more than six years.|$|E
5|$|Whether or not {{the summit}} is {{considered}} important for its content, the meeting held some symbolic importance. First of all, {{it was the first}} NATO summit between the leaders of the North-American and Western European states, and Eastern European states, states that were finally, after decades of Cold War tensions, together in the same alliance. The media attention that these new members received during the summit, opened public debates about whether there was still a consensus about the purpose, the perceived threats and the future borders of NATO among its 26 members. That this was not the case, became clear {{in the run-up to the}} 2006 Riga Summit. Secondly, the holding of the summit in Istanbul made it the most eastern summit in NATO's history. It marked the increasingly key role played by Turkey as a major strategic hub due to its location close to the hotbeds of tension and conflict in the South Caucasus and the Middle East. The location of the summit made clear that NATO’s security concerns had shifted towards the southeastern part of the European continent. By shifting eastwards, the Alliance’s centre of gravity ventured <b>into</b> <b>very</b> different areas from those on which the Cold War military NATO had focused.|$|E

In most trogon species, both sexes help with nest construction. The process may take several months, {{and a single}} pair may start several excavations before finding a tree or stump with wood of the right consistency.|$|E

25|$|The {{prohibition}} against cutting {{the corners of}} the beard may also have been an attempt to distinguish the appearance of Israelites from that of the surrounding nations, and reduce the influence of foreign religions; Maimonides criticises it as being the custom of idolatrous priests. The Hittites and Elamites were clean-shaven, and the Sumerians were also frequently without a beard; conversely, the Egyptians and Libyans shaved the beard <b>into</b> <b>very</b> stylised elongated goatees.|$|E
25|$|One {{desirable}} {{property of}} all PLLs {{is that the}} reference and feedback clock edges be brought <b>into</b> <b>very</b> close alignment. The average difference in time between the phases of the two signals when the PLL has achieved lock is called the static phase offset (also called the steady-state phase error). The variance between these phases is called tracking jitter. Ideally, the static phase offset should be zero, and the tracking jitter should be as low as possible.|$|E

25|$|Limited-range drivers, {{also used}} alone, are {{typically}} found in computers, toys, and clock radios.

In these applications, sound quality is a low priority. The human ear is remarkably tolerant of poor sound quality, and the distortion inherent in limited-range drivers may enhance their output at high frequencies, increasing clarity when listening to spoken word material.|$|E

In March 1868 he had a serious accident, a horse smashing his head against a gatepost of his own yard.

25|$|Most commonly, the {{location}} is determined using GPS and the transmission mechanism is SMS, GPRS, or a satellite or terrestrial radio from {{the vehicle to}} a radio receiver. A single antenna unit covering all the needed frequency bands can be employed. GSM and EVDO {{are the most common}} services applied, because of the low data rate needed for AVL, and the low cost and near-ubiquitous nature of these public networks. The low bandwidth requirements also allow for satellite technology to receive telemetry data at a moderately higher cost, but across a global coverage area and <b>into</b> <b>very</b> remote locations not covered well by terrestrial radio or public carriers.|$|E
25|$|Mica's {{value is}} based on its unique {{physical}} properties. It has a crystalline structure which forms layers which can be split (delaminated) <b>into</b> <b>very</b> thin sheets (0.125 to 0.025mm. or thinner), while remaining stable when exposed to electricity). This gives it superior electrical properties as an insulator and a dielectric, as it can support an electrostatic field while dissipating minimal {{energy in the form}} of heat. It also has a high dielectric breakdown and is resistant to corona discharge. It is also stable when exposed to light, moisture and extreme temperatures. Mica is also chemically inert, dielectric, elastic, flexible, hydrophilic, insulating, lightweight, platy, reflective, refractive, resilient, and ranges in opacity from transparent to opaque.|$|E
25|$|Brittany, {{apart from}} some {{areas such as}} Lorient, Nantes and Saint-Nazaire, has never been heavily industrialised. Today, fishing and {{agriculture}} remain important activities. Brittany has more than 40,000 agricultural exploitations, mostly oriented towards cattle, pig and poultry breeding, and cereals and vegetables production. The number of exploitations tends to diminish, but as a result, they are merged <b>into</b> <b>very</b> large estates. Brittany is the first producer in France for vegetables (green beans, onions, artichokes, potatoes, tomatoes...). Cereals are mostly grown for cattle feeding. Wine, especially muscadet, is made in a small region south of Nantes. Brittany is the first region in France for fishing. The activity employs around 9,000 people, and more than 60 firms work in fish and seafood processing.|$|E

25|$|The female lays her fertilised eggs on the ground, {{near the}} nest of a ground-nesting solitary bee. The larvae are very active {{as soon as}} they hatch. They climb a {{flowering}} plant and await the arrival of a solitary bee. They hook themselves on to the bee using the three claws on their legs that give the first instar larvae their name, triungulins (from Latin tri, three, and ungulus, claw). The bee carries the larvae back to its nest, where they feed on bee larvae and the bees' food supplies. The larvae are thus somewhere between predators and parasites. The active larvae moult <b>into</b> <b>very</b> different, more typically scarabaeoid larvae for the remaining two or more instars, in a development type called hypermetamorphosis. The adults emerge from the bees' nest and fly to the woody plants on which they feed.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{fundamental}} {{steps in the}} fusion process, although each of these steps actually represents a complex sequence of events. First, the involved membranes must aggregate, approaching each other to within several nanometers. Second, the two bilayers must come <b>into</b> <b>very</b> close contact (within a few angstroms). To achieve this close contact, the two surfaces must become at least partially dehydrated, as the bound surface water normally present causes bilayers to strongly repel at this distance. Third, a destabilization must develop at one point between the two bilayers, inducing a highly localized rearrangement of the two bilayers. Finally, as this point defect grows, {{the components of the}} two bilayers mix and diffuse away from the site of contact. Depending on whether hemifusion or full fusion occurs, the internal contents of the membranes may mix at this point as well.|$|E
25|$|A short {{distance}} past {{the church is}} Nutgrove Avenue, widened and extended during the 1960s to link up with Churchtown. The old quiet tree shaded avenue has been completely swept away, along with the narrow lanes a cramped passage bounded on both sides by towering walls and full of right angled bends, which wended its crooked course between Loreto Convent cemetery and the garden of Nutgrove House. A massive gateway stood {{at the entrance to}} this avenue until about 1911, which bore the inscription Nutgrove School Established 1802. In 1839 the school was under the supervision of Mr. Philip Jones, who continued to hold the post of principal until 1866 when the position was held by Mrs. Anne Jones. In 1876 the school closed down and the house was occupied as a private residence by various tenants down to recent years becoming the parish councilheadquarters. The new avenue was laid through the former school grounds and the house, shorn of its ornamental gardens, stood with its front against the footpath. At some time the house had been disfigured with a rather unsightly concrete porch and the old brickwork covered with cement plaster, concealing {{the fact that this was}} a very interesting eighteenth century building containing a fine stairs and coved ceilings with good plaster decoration. Unfortunately the house fell <b>into</b> <b>very</b> bad repair and eventually was demolished. Joyce in his Neighbourhood of Dublin states that this house was at one time the dower house of Rathfarnham Castle but in this he is almost certainly mistaken, as Frizell's map of 1779 shows that it was outside the estate. It is possible that he confused it with the other old house on the opposite side of the avenue which was formerly named Ely Cottage, later altered to Ely Lodge, and which was shown to be within the boundary of the estate. This house was in very bad repair but has recently been restored in a very tasteful manner.|$|E
