5|$|Stars {{are created}} within galaxies from a reserve of cold gas that forms into giant {{molecular}} clouds. Some galaxies {{have been observed}} to form stars at an exceptional rate, which {{is known as a}} starburst. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> to do so, then they would consume their reserve of gas in a time span less than the lifespan of the galaxy. Hence starburst activity usually lasts for only about ten million years, a relatively brief period in the history of a galaxy. Starburst galaxies were more common during the early history of the Universe, and, at present, still contribute an estimated 15% to the total star production rate.|$|E

25|$|Illegal {{immigration}} to the United States is the entry into the United States of foreign nationals without government permission, and in violation of United States immigration laws. Foreign nationals are also illegal immigrants <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> {{to be in the}} country after their visa, or other authority to enter or be in the country, has expired. The United States nearly had open borders until 1924, which meant that all immigrants to the United States up to that point were legal. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and a few other modest border regulations were enacted in the 1870s and 1880s. The Immigration Act of 1924 established visa requirements and enacted quotas for immigrants from specific countries.|$|E
25|$|While it is {{not certain}} {{that the first time}} someone robs a bank they will be caught, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> to rob banks, they will most likely be caught. Few criminals are able to make a {{successful}} living out of bank robbery over the long run. Bank robberies are still fairly common and are indeed successful, although eventually many bank robbers are found and arrested. A report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation states that, among Category I serious crimes, the arrest rate for bank robbery in 2001 was second only to that of murder. Today most organized crime groups tend to make their money by other means, such as extortion, drug trafficking, gambling, prostitution, loan sharking, identity theft, or online scamming and phishing.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} second lawsuit above, Valve's Erik Johnson stated in a July 13, 2016, letter to Gamasutra that they will demand the {{third-party}} sites that use Steam functionality to aid in gambling to cease their use of Steam in that manner, as their methods of connectivity and use go against Steam's acceptable use policy. Johnson also stated that Valve has no business relationships with these sites, and will pursue legal action <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> to violate their service terms. On July 20, 2016, Valve followed by issuing several cease and desist letters to 23 sites they believed involved in skin gambling that were inappropriately using their services, giving them ten days to discontinue use of the Steamworks API. Another 20 sites were issued similar cease and desist notices by Valve a week later.|$|E

Finally, in despair, Raj asks his parents to find him a potential bride for an arranged marriage. Raj gets along well with his parents' first selection, but discovers that the woman is a lesbian trying to conceal her sexual orientation from her family: she assumes Raj is also homosexual and that they would have a lavender marriage, an idea Raj considers as a viable alternative to lifelong bachelorhood until Howard and Bernadette convince him otherwise.|$|E

2500|$|Pliny {{gives an}} account of how the trials are {{conducted}} and the various verdicts (sections 4-6). He says he first asks if the accused is a Christian: if they confess that they are, he interrogates them twice more, {{for a total of}} three times, threatening them with death <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> to confirm their beliefs. If they do not recant, then he orders them to be executed, or, if they are Roman citizens, orders them to be taken to Rome. Despite his uncertainty about the offences connected with being Christian, Pliny says that he has no doubt that, whatever the nature of their creed, at least their inflexible obstinacy (obstinatio) and stubbornness, (pertinacia) deserve punishment. This shows that, to the Roman authorities, Christians were being hostile to the government and were openly defying a magistrate who was asking them to abandon an unwanted cult. [...] Most notably, the Christians present at these trials Pliny is inquiring about were accused by a privately published anonymous document and not by Pliny nor the empire.|$|E
2500|$|By contrast, {{wrongful}} trading {{is a cause}} of action that arises when directors have acted negligently. The Insolvency Act 1986 section 214 states that directors (including de facto and shadow directors) are culpable for {{wrongful trading}} <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> to trade when [...] "at some time before the commencement of the winding up of the company, that person knew or ought to have {{concluded that there was}} no reasonable prospect that the company would avoid going into insolvent liquidation". To determine whether someone [...] "ought" [...] to have concluded this, a director is judged by the skills one ought to have for their office, and a higher standard if the director has special skills (such as an accountancy qualification). In Re Produce Marketing Consortium Ltd (No 2) two directors presided over the insolvency of a Spanish and Cypriot orange and lemon business. One had experience in bookkeeping. Knox J held that although in small companies procedures and equipment for keeping records will be less than in large companies, under section 214 [...] "certain minimum standards are to be assumed to be attained" [...] like keeping the accounts reasonably accurate. Here the accounts were done late even as debts were mounting. The basic measure of compensation payable by directors for wrongful trading is assessed according to the loss a director creates from the point in time where insolvency was plainly unavoidable. However, the court has the discretion to take into account all appropriate factors. In Re Brian D Pierson (Contractors) Ltd Hazel Williamson QC held that the directors of a golf course business were culpable for wrongful trading, but reduced their contribution by 30 per cent because poor weather had made profitable golf business more difficult than normal.|$|E
