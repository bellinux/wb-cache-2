Such distortions from 'leaders' of organizations and parties is a disgrace not only to the organizations and institutions they serve, but to the First Amendment.|$|E
25|$|After a {{year away}} playing in league cricket in 1963, {{he came back to}} Lancashire in 1964 and was a regular in the first team for three seasons. In 1965, with the benefit of playing in 35 {{first-class}} matches, he set a record that is unlikely ever to be beaten by scoring more than 2,000 runs without a single century: his highest for the season was 85. The previous highest number of runs in a season without a century was 1,709 by C.B. Harris in 1935, whilst not since 1970 <b>has</b> <b>anyone</b> scored 1,500 runs with no centuries in one season. After a more moderate season in 1966, he was injured and drifted out of the side in 1967, and was allowed to leave Lancashire {{at the end of the}} season to join Gloucestershire.|$|E

500|$|Petar I Petrović-Njegoš preached {{among people}} against superstition. He {{strongly}} condemned the denunciation and persecution {{of women as}} witches. After one such incident in 1830 in south Montenegro, Petar I wrote an epistle, mentioning vjedogonje in a sentence: [...] "Nowhere have I found nor <b>has</b> <b>anyone</b> told me that witches and vjedogonje exist, except in the blind and sad Serbian people, because it is blind and believes lies rather than Christ's Gospel and Christ's teachings and commands." ...|$|E

500|$|Bakshi {{is quoted}} as saying that he had [...] "mixed feeling" [...] about Jackson's adaptations, {{although}} he had not seen the films. [...] "In some respects I feel good that Peter Jackson continued and went on, and in some respects I feel bad that Saul Zaentz, the producer, and various people never called me, thanked me, or asked my permission to do the movie. [...] <b>has</b> <b>anyone</b> sent me a bottle of wine, on the tremendous success. [...] But I have more feelings on the business side of that than I do on the creative side. I'm glad Peter Jackson had a movie to look at—I never did. And certainly there's a lot to learn from watching any movie, both its mistakes and when it works. So he had a little easier time than I did, and a lot better budget." ...|$|E

Leakes and Moore found themselves {{in the midst of}} a heated verbal argument, while Parks' husband Apollo Nida and Moore's assistant Brandon Deshazer engaged in a physical fight. Burruss was later angered by false allegations spread about Tucker and notably delivered the line, [...] "I will drag you in this, bitch!", as she was pulled away from the incident. Rodney Ho from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution acknowledged the situation as [...] "one of the most violent fights in the six-year history of the program", while Bailey commented on : [...] "I've been on this show for four years and never, ever in the history of the whole show <b>has</b> <b>anyone</b> laid hands on each other." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jerome K. Jerome {{has been}} cited as an {{influence}} on Zamyatin’s novel. Jerome’s short essay [...] "The New Utopia" [...] (1891) describes a regimented future city, indeed world, of nightmarish egalitarianism, {{where men and women}} are barely distinguishable in their grey uniforms (Zamyatin's [...] "unifs") and all have short black hair, natural or dyed. No one has names: women wear even numbers on their tunics, and men wear odd, just as in We. Equality is taken to such lengths that people with well-developed physiques are liable to have lopped limbs. In Zamyatin, similarly, the equalisation of noses is earnestly proposed. Jerome <b>has</b> <b>anyone</b> with an overactive imagination subjected to a levelling-down operation—something of central importance in We. Even more significant is the appreciation {{on the part of both}} Jerome and Zamyatin that the individual, and by extension, familial love, is a disruptive and humanizing force. [...] Jerome's works were translated in Russia three times before 1917. Three Men in a Boat is a set book in Russian schools.|$|E
