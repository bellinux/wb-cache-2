25|$|By the 1950s most {{observers}} agreed that Taft-Hartley {{was no more}} disastrous for workers than the Wagner Act had been for employers. What ordinarily mattered most in labor relations was not government laws such as Taft-Hartley, but the relative power of unions and management in the economic marketplace. Where unions were strong they usually managed all right; when they were weak, new laws <b>did</b> <b>them</b> little additional harm.|$|E

The young lions do lack and suffer hunger, but they that seek the Lord," [...] that fear him, [...] "shall not want any good thing" [...] (Psa 34:9,10). Not anything that God sees good for them shall those men want that fear the Lord. If health will <b>do</b> <b>them</b> good, if sickness will <b>do</b> <b>them</b> good, if riches will <b>do</b> <b>them</b> good, if poverty will <b>do</b> <b>them</b> good, if life will <b>do</b> <b>them</b> good, if death will <b>do</b> <b>them</b> good, then they shall not want them, neither shall any of these come nigh them, if they will not <b>do</b> <b>them</b> good. The lions, the wicked people [19] {{of the world that}} fear not God, are not made sharers in this great privilege; all things fall out to them contrary, because they fear not God. In the midst of their sufficiency, they are in want of that good that God puts into the worst things that the man that feareth God doth meet with in the world.|$|R

25|$|Many of Woodward's syntheses were {{described}} as spectacular by his colleagues and before he <b>did</b> <b>them,</b> it was thought by some {{that it would be}} impossible to create these substances in the lab. Woodward's syntheses were also described as having an element of art in them, and since then, synthetic chemists have always looked for elegance as well as utility in synthesis. His work also involved the exhaustive use of the then newly developed techniques of infrared spectroscopy and later, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Another important feature of Woodward's syntheses was their attention to stereochemistry or the particular configuration of molecules in three-dimensional space. Most natural products of medicinal importance are effective, for example as drugs, only when they possess a specific stereochemistry. This creates the demand for 'stereoselective synthesis', producing a compound with a defined stereochemistry. While today a typical synthetic route routinely involves such a procedure, Woodward was a pioneer in showing how, with exhaustive and rational planning, one could conduct reactions that were stereoselective. Many of his syntheses involved forcing a molecule into a certain configuration by installing rigid structural elements in it, another tactic that has become standard today. In this regard, especially his syntheses of reserpine and strychnine were landmarks.|$|E
25|$|In October 1925, Crosby and {{his partner}} Al Rinker, brother of singer Mildred Bailey, decided to seek fame in California. They {{traveled}} to Los Angeles where they met up with Mildred Bailey. She introduced them to her show business contacts, and the Fanchon and Marco Time Agency hired them for thirteen weeks for a revue called The Syncopation Idea, starting at the Boulevard Theater in Los Angeles {{and then on the}} Loew's circuit. They each earned $75 a week. Bing and Al Rinker began as a minor part of The Syncopation Idea and it was there that they started to develop as entertainers. They had a lively and individual style and were particularly popular with college students. After The Syncopation Idea closed, Bing and Al worked in the Will Morrissey Music Hall Revue. They further honed their skills with Morrissey, and blossomed when they subsequently had the chance to present their own independent act, and were quickly spotted by the Paul Whiteman organization. At that time, it was felt that Whiteman needed something different and entertaining to break up his musical selections, and Crosby and Rinker filled this requirement. After less than a year in full-time show business, they had become part of one {{of the biggest names in}} the entertainment world. Hired for $150 a week in 1926, they debuted with Whiteman on December 6 at the Tivoli Theatre in Chicago. Their first recording, in October 1926, was I've Got the Girl, with Don Clark's Orchestra, but the Columbia-issued record <b>did</b> <b>them</b> no vocal favors, as it was inadvertently recorded at a speed slower than it should have been, which increased the singers' pitch when played at 78rpm. Throughout his career, Crosby often credited Mildred Bailey for getting him his first important job in the entertainment business.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers next {{traveled}} to Comerica Park {{for a series}} against the Detroit Tigers. They hit six doubles, including two by Chris Taylor for a 8–5 win. The Dodgers tied a major league record the next day, with their 13th consecutive interleague win, 3–0 over the Tigers. The 2004 Devil Rays and 2006 Red Sox had also won 13 in a row. However, that streak {{came to an end}} the next day, with a 6–1 loss in the series finale. Curtis Granderson, whom the Dodgers had acquired from the Mets a couple of days before, hit a solo homer for the Dodgers only run but a four-run sixth, sparked by a Justin Upton homer <b>did</b> <b>them</b> in. They {{traveled to}} PNC Park the next day for a four-game series against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Puig hit a home run in the 12th inning to give the Dodgers a 6–5 win. Granderson hit a grand slam homer earlier in the game, and became the first player in MLB history to hit two grand slams in the same week for two different organizations. The following day, spot starter Brock Stewart struggled, allowing five runs in the third inning without recording an out but the Dodgers bullpen prevented more damage and the offense picked up the clack. Chris Taylor had three hits and three RBI as they came back to win 8–5. In the next game, Rich Hill took a perfect game into the ninth inning only to have it broken up by an error on Logan Forsythe. With the Dodgers offense unable to score, he remained in the game for the 10th and allowed his first hit, a leadoff homer by Josh Harrison to lose the game 1–0. Granderson hit his third homer of the week in the next game, and Yasmani Grandal and Adrian Gonzalez hit back-to-back homers in the eighth as they took the final game of the series, 5–2. They became the first Dodgers team ever and the first in the majors since the 2001 Mariners to win their 90th game within their first 126 games.|$|E

With this goal, Torres {{became the first}} player to score in seven different competitions in one season. In April 2013, Torres acknowledged his struggles at Chelsea, saying, [...] "I want to do the things I used to do. I <b>did</b> <b>them</b> at Atlético, I <b>did</b> <b>them</b> at Liverpool, but I am not doing them at Chelsea," [...] but he vowed to [...] "try his heart out" [...] to regain his best form. He scored twice against Rubin Kazan in the 3–1 win in the first leg of the Europa League quarter-final on 4 April 2013, before scoring again in the second leg 3–2 defeat, with Chelsea progressing to the semi-final 5–4 on aggregate. Torres scored the opening goal in Chelsea's 2–1 triumph over Benfica in the 2013 UEFA Europa League Final on 15 May 2013. During the final match of the season, a 2–1 home win over Everton, he scored his first league goal of 2013, and finished the season with 22 goals in 64 matches.|$|E

Rough sketches and designs were created early during the recording sessions, and some experimental designs were conceived to closely resemble, as Averill put it, [...] "dance-music oriented sleeves.

500|$|Diocletian {{entered the}} city of Rome in the early winter of 303. On 20 November, he celebrated, with Maximian, the twentieth anniversary of his reign (vicennalia), the tenth anniversary of the tetrarchy (decennalia), and a triumph for the war with Persia. Diocletian soon grew {{impatient}} with the city, as the Romans acted towards him with what Edward Gibbon, following Lactantius, calls [...] "licentious familiarity". The Roman people did not give enough deference to his supreme authority; it expected him to act the part of an aristocratic ruler, not a monarchic one. On 20 December 303, Diocletian cut short his stay in Rome and left for the north. He did not even perform the ceremonies investing him with his ninth consulate; he <b>did</b> <b>them</b> in Ravenna on 1 January 304 instead. There are suggestions in the Panegyrici Latini and Lactantius' account that Diocletian arranged plans for his and Maximian's future retirement of power in Rome.

[...] Tzara indicated: [...] "I am against systems; the most acceptable system is on principle to have none." [...] In addition, Tzara, who once stated that [...] "logic is always false", probably approved of Serner's vision of a [...] "final dissolution".
