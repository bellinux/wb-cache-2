500|$|Woods overcame {{difficulties}} with stuttering as a boy. This {{was not known}} until {{he wrote a letter}} to a boy who contemplated suicide. Woods wrote, [...] "I know what it's like to be different and to sometimes not fit in. I also stuttered as a child and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> my dog and he would sit there and listen until he fell asleep. I also took a class for two years to help me, and I finally learned to stop." ...|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{recruited}} artist Jeff Koons for {{the project}} in early 2013; the two had met previously at a Metropolitan Museum of Art fashion event three years earlier, where Gaga had a live performance. According to Koons, Gaga [...] "just kind of grabbed ahold of me {{and gave me a}} big hug around my waist and replied, 'You know, Jeff, I've been such a fan of yours, and when I was a kid just hanging out in Central Park <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> my friends about your work'." [...] In addition to Interscope Records notifying mainstream media outlets about upcoming releases for Artpop in July 2013, Gaga announced plans for a multimedia software application which [...] "combines music, art, fashion, and technology with a new interactive worldwide community." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gaga {{recruited}} Jeff Koons {{into the}} project in early 2013, with the two having previously met at a Metropolitan Museum of Art fashion event three years earlier, where Gaga provided a live performance. According to Koons, she [...] "just kind of grabbed ahold of me {{and gave me a}} big hug around my waist [...] " [...] and replied, [...] "You know, Jeff, I've been such a fan of yours, and when I was a kid just hanging out in Central Park <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> my friends about your work." [...] Following her hip surgery in February 2013, the singer was forced into a six-month hiatus, during which she studied literature and music with the Haus of Gaga in addition to sharing [...] "creative gifts". This stage allowed her to review and enhance her creative direction, which she admitted to be a meticulous [...] "gazing process". [...] "I have to gaze into the work {{for long periods of time}} for it to be good," [...] adding that upon analyzing her ideas, she received [...] "that wonderful feeling" [...] which told her [...] "that's the one".|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> aloud <b>to</b> {{these notes}} and wrangle over {{them in my}} workroom--while the plans of Lord Roberts B waited.|$|R
6000|$|... "A little amateurish," [...] {{said the}} Curate from Iping Hanger to Mr Rathbone-Slater. [...] "A great gift, undoubtedly, but a certain lack of {{sustained}} training. There were {{one or two}} little things ... <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|From {{your letter}} {{you seem to}} have taken an active feeling, to say the least, in this matter, that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about. I could write, but do not want to do so. Why not come down here and see me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{let me go}} on. You made me {{always go}} and talk with him for her, and you didn't think <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him for myself. Well, I didn't!" ...|$|E
60|$|Walkirk's plan amused me very much, and I {{told him}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> my {{grandmother}} about it. When I did so, I was much {{surprised to find}} that she received the idea with favor.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor Albinia! I {{am afraid}} it {{is a hard}} task: but these are still early days, and we see things at a disadvantage. We shall be able to judge whether there be really too great a strain on her spirits, and if so, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Kendal.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} other man, who was younger. [...] "There are one or two {{complaints}} not unusual in that country which appear to somewhat resemble it, but they are seldom so virulent. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Austin about it later, but in the meanwhile----" ...|$|R
60|$|And so John Carter, Prince of Helium, meekly {{surrendered}} {{to a single}} antagonist. The others now swarmed about us, asking many questions, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them, and finally my captor {{announced that he would}} lead me back to my cell.|$|R
6000|$|... "But do {{not leave}} your {{grandfather}} this evening. Give him my love, and say that I think it best that I should remain at Orley Farm till the trial be over. And, Peregrine, if I were you <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him much about the trial." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The talk {{of white}} men is wholly lacking in dignity,' said the lama, who judged only by tone. 'But I {{considered}} the countenance of that priest and I think he is learned. Is it likely that he will understand our talk? <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him of my Search.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would say}} so, of course--very natural. As {{a matter of}} fact I haven't heard very much. Strictly speaking, it was Martin. He {{collects}} information, and so on. You don't suppose <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> that Schomberg animal more than I could help? It was Martin whom he took into his confidence." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{would be}} her friend, I {{repeated}} to myself, I {{would be her}} friend. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her often, plan with her, work with her. I could put my meanings into her life and she should throw her beauty over mine. I began already to dream of the talk of to-morrow's meeting....|$|E
3000|$|... “At {{first it}} (SE) was low. <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> need grammar…that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> properly. But {{you said we}} don’t need grammar.” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] Andrew said. [...] "I {{never so}} much as dreamt of it. If I had done so he and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>talked</b> {{together}} <b>to</b> a purpose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may think}} it strange," [...] said she, [...] "that I talk {{in this way}} to you, but you came here {{to find out what}} sort of girl I am, and I am {{perfectly}} willing to help you do it. Besides, in a case like this, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> a man than to a woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis now of no moment," [...] {{returned}} the Pilot; [...] "my knowledge and my ignorance are alike immaterial, as {{the command of}} the party is surrendered to other and perhaps more proper hands. But <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> this lady alone, sir; she is an acquaintance of my youth, and I will see her {{on her way to}} the abbey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By the eternal," [...] said he, [...] "you are a cool man. Give me my coat," [...] {{he shouted}} to the bystanders, and they helped him on with it. [...] "Now," [...] said he, {{as they made}} to follow him, [...] "keep back. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> this gentleman. By the heavens," [...] he cried, when he had gained the room, [...] "I believe you are not afraid of me. I saw it in your eyes." ...|$|E
60|$|After a while I {{was carried}} to the gallery, and there <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the little doctor about the yellow fever which had swept the city. Monsieur Perrin was {{not much of a}} doctor, to be sure, and he had a heartier dread of the American {{invasion}} than of the scourge. He worshipped the Vicomtesse, and was so devoid of professional pride as to give her freely all credit for my recovery. He too, clothed her with the qualities of statesmanship.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Emma,' said Theodora, 'we {{need not}} go on as {{if we did not}} {{understand}} each other. Violet can attend to you now; <b>I</b> wish you <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her. No one can comfort as she can.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Since {{her studies}} Claudia Rosiny has devoted {{herself to her}} {{specialist}} fields of Video Dance and Intermediality in Dance: [...] "Inter- and transdisciplinary cultural studies are needed in an art context of convergence, in which the disciplines come together, connect and enable new experiences of perception. (...) If time travel was possible, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the pioneers of film and dance, like Georges Méliès or Loïe Fuller, and ask them what, back then, fascinated them most in the interplay of movement of dance and film." ...|$|R
6000|$|Esmond laughed, {{as though}} he had partly {{expected}} this. [...] "There are no doubt more of you behind there. If you have one, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> prefer <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> your recognized leader." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Majesty! I hate {{to preach}} this way. But I promised your mother <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you. And {{the truth is}} I hate--I hate what I'm saying. I envy you your courage and wisdom. I know you have refused to marry Boyd Harvey. I could see that in his face. I believe you will refuse Castleton. Whom will you marry? What chance is there for a woman of your {{position}} to marry out here? What {{in the world will}} become of you?" ...|$|E
60|$|Never {{were a man}} and a woman happier {{together}} than I and Natalie. Mentally, physically, spiritually we {{were perfectly}} mated, and we loved each other dearly. Truly we were as one. Yet there was something about her which filled me with vague fears, especially after she found that she was to become a mother. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her of the child, but she would sigh and shake her head, her eyes filling with tears, and say that we must not count on the continuance of such happiness as ours, for it was too great.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} be foolish," [...] she said softly. [...] "Sir Michael is very rich> and you are his only near relative. Besides, you have had such a lonely time, and it is quite time that you saw {{a little of the}} other side of life. Sir Michael is a {{particular}} friend of mine, and I promised him that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about this. I am most anxious to hear that you get on well together. You can be amiable if you like, you know, and you can be very much the other thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I will {{be going}} along, too, Mrs. Peagrim. I'll walk a few yards with you, Freddie, my boy. There are one or two things <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over. Till to-night, Mrs. Peagrim." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't look at him," [...] said Flora de Barral. [...] "I {{had done}} with looking at people. He said to me: `My sister does not put herself out much for us. We had better keep each other company. I have read every book there is in that cottage.' I walked on. He did not leave me. I thought he ought to. But he didn't. He didn't seem to notice that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Ukridge {{going away}} {{like this has}} left me in a most {{unpleasant}} position. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> it over with you. I daresay you know that we--that Mr. Ukridge owes {{a considerable amount of}} money round about here to tradesmen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{shall not}} do that sort of thing," [...] said I; [...] "and now let us walk on slowly, while I tell you what I meant by the term brother." [...] I was in a whirl of delight. Now <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> one who I {{believed}} would sympathize with my every thought, who would be in harmony with my outreachings, if she could do no more, and from whom I need expect neither ridicule nor revilings. We walked on slowly, and I laid before her my scheme for the brotherhood of the House of Martha.|$|E
60|$|I love bright, pure colours, and, my {{sweeping}} and dusting and bedmaking over, and my external {{mourning for}} my father at an end, a remarkably festive figure would confront me in my cheval glass of an afternoon. The hours I spent in dressing my hair and matching this bit of colour with that. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> myself in the glass, too, for company's sake, and make believe I was a dozen different characters. I was young. I pined for life and companionship, and having only my own--for Mrs Bowater was rather a faithful feature of the landscape than a fellow being--I made as much, and as many, of myself as possible.|$|E
60|$|I kept {{in touch}} with him. Mere curiosity would have made me do that. He grew more normal as the years went by, and {{gradually}} the fancy that had come to me at our first meeting faded farther into the background. Sometimes, using the very language of the dead man's letter, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him, wondering if by any chance some flash of memory would come back to him, and once or twice {{it seemed to me that}} into the mild, pathetic eyes there came a look that I had seen before, but it passed away, and indeed, it was difficult to think of this sad little human oddity, with its pleading helplessness, in connection with the strong, swift, conquering spirit that I had watched passing away amid the silence of the mountains.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Ramsey: [...] "They will {{when they}} find how nice it is. But {{why do you keep}} standing? Sit down, if it's only for a moment. There is {{something}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with you about. What were you saying when you came in? I didn't catch it quite." ...|$|R
5000|$|.....<b>I</b> <b>would</b> like <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> {{representing}} {{all those}} veterans, {{and say that}} several months ago in Detroit, we had an investigation at which over 150 honorably discharged and many very highly decorated veterans testified to war crimes committed in Southeast Asia, not isolated incidents but crimes committed {{on a day-to-day basis}} with the full awareness of officers at all levels of command.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had a faint idea {{once that}} things were as you say they are, but the affair of the ring--of the {{unexpected}} ring--puzzled me. Wish SHE"--he indicated Miss Klegg's back with a nod--"was {{at the bottom of}} the sea.... <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about this--soon. If you don't think it would be a social outrage, perhaps I might walk with you to your railway station." ...|$|R
