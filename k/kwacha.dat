5|$|In 2000, Malawi's Ministry of Health and Population began {{developing}} {{a plan to}} distribute antiretroviral drugs to the population, and, as of 2003, there were several sites providing antiretroviral drugs in Malawi. The Lighthouse, a trust in Lilongwe that fights HIV/AIDS, provides antiretroviral drugs {{at a cost of}} 2,500 <b>kwacha</b> per month. Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre provides antiretroviral therapy through its outpatient department, and Médecins Sans Frontières distributes antiretroviral drugs to patients for free in the Chiradzulu and Thyolo Districts. Many different private providers sell antiretroviral drugs, particularly in cities; however, very few patients can afford to receive drugs from the private sector in Malawi. In addition, private providers are not currently required to obtain certification before selling antiretroviral drugs, and, therefore, this practice is not closely monitored. Finally, some employees receive access to antiretroviral drugs through the health insurance policies provided by their employers, but this practice is not widespread.|$|E

Any contact with cash will snap their spell and leave the wizard naked and confused. So placing cash, such as <b>kwacha</b> around a room or bed mat will protect the resident from their malevolent spells.|$|E
500|$|D. D. Phiri, a Malawian historian, characterised Chilembwe's {{uprising}} as {{an early}} expression of Malawian nationalism, as did George Shepperson and Thomas Price in their 1958 book Independent African, an exhaustive study of Chilembwe and his rebellion that was banned during the colonial era but still widely read by the educated classes. Chilembwe became viewed as an [...] "unproblematic" [...] hero {{by many of the}} country's people. The Malawi Congress Party (MCP), which ultimately led the country to independence in 1964, made a conscious effort to identify its leader Hastings Banda with Chilembwe through speeches and radio broadcasts. Bakili Muluzi, who succeeded Banda in 1994, similarly invoked Chilembwe's memory to win popular support, inaugurating a new annual national holiday, Chilembwe Day, on 16 January 1995. Chilembwe's portrait was soon added to the national currency, the <b>kwacha,</b> and reproduced on Malawian stamps. It has been argued that for Malawian politicians, Chilembwe has become [...] "symbol, legitimising myth, instrument and propaganda".|$|E

2500|$|In June 2008 in Zambia {{the issue}} of teacher-student sexual abuse and sexual assault {{was brought to the}} {{attention}} of the High Court of Zambia where a landmark case decision, with presiding Judge Philip Musonda, awarded $45million Zambian <b>kwacha</b> ($13,000 USD) to the plaintiff, a 13-year-old girl for sexual abuse and rape by her school teacher. This claim was brought against her teacher as a [...] "person of authority" [...] who, as Judge Musonda stated, [...] "had a moral superiority (responsibility) over his students" [...] at the time.|$|E
2500|$|The EMMS also {{funds the}} Ekwendeni College of Health Sciences at the University of Livingstonia. [...] The {{university}} {{is one of}} only three universities in Malawi. [...] The health sciences college has 144 student nurses who study for a diploma as a nurse/midwife technician. [...] The EMMS has provided textbooks and funded a student hardship fund. [...] These funds have been crucial as the cost to educate, feed, and house students is $2000 per year, while the student can only fund individually about $800 on average. [...] The devaluation of the country’s currency, the Malawi <b>kwacha,</b> makes it more likely that students will be in financial need for sponsorship. [...] With the EMMS’s contributions, the college was able to construct a male student hostel and become the first college in Malawi to train male nurses.|$|E

50|$|Until 1991, all Zambian {{banknotes}} {{featured a}} portrait of President Kenneth Kaunda on the obverse. After 1992, all notes have instead featured a fish eagle on the obverse. After 1989, all the reverses featured the Chainbreaker statue. In 2003, Zambia became the first African country to issue polymer banknotes. The 500 and 1000 <b>kwacha</b> were both printed on polymer. Although the old 20 <b>kwacha</b> note was still in circulation until 2012, such is the rarity of this note that most major retailers rounded prices up to the nearest 50 <b>kwacha</b> when calculating a total. Most items in major supermarkets were displayed using 20 <b>kwacha</b> in the value (e.g., 1980 <b>kwacha).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>kwacha</b> ( [...] ; ISO 4217: MWK, {{official}} name Malawi <b>Kwacha)</b> is {{the currency of}} Malawi as of 1971, replacing the Malawian pound. It is divided into 100 tambala. The <b>kwacha</b> replaced other types of currency, namely the UK pound sterling, the South African rand and the Rhodesian dollar, that had previously circulated through the Malawian economy. The exchange rate of the <b>kwacha</b> undergoes fixed periodical adjustments, but since 1994 the exchange rate has floated. In 2005, administrative measures {{were put in place}} by Bingu wa Mutharika to peg the exchange rate with other currencies. Banknotes are issued by the Reserve Bank of Malawi. In May 2012, the Reserve Bank of Malawi devalued the <b>kwacha</b> by 34% and unpegged it from the United States dollar.|$|E
50|$|On 23 May 2012, the Nyasa Times {{reported}} that the Reserve Bank of Malawi introduced the new 1,000 <b>kwacha</b> note into circulation along with the proposed new notes.

50|$|The Zambian <b>kwacha</b> {{was first}} issued in 1968 {{to replace the}} Zambian pound. The design of the <b>kwacha</b> bill changed as time went on, also, {{different}} bills were either introduced in or withdrawn from circulation. Seven emissions of the first <b>kwacha</b> are known to exist, while only one emission of the second <b>kwacha</b> was introduced in circulation in January 1, 2013 and still existing since then without any changes in design or security features.

50|$|On July 1, 1966, the {{parliament}} approved the arrangements of the decimal currency system (Act 40 of 1966). The government {{voted in favor}} of decimalisation, and changing the main currency unit to <b>Kwacha,</b> with one <b>kwacha</b> being equal to 100 ngwee. The exchange rate was set to one <b>kwacha</b> equivalent to ten Zambian shillings, or one half of a Zambian pound. Thus, by January 16, 1968 all Zambian pound bills and coins were removed from circulation and replaced by the new <b>kwacha</b> bills, and ngwee coins. The Zambian pound bills of 10 shillings, 1, and 5 pounds were changed into 1, 2 and 10 <b>kwacha</b> respectively, a bill of 50 ngwee was issued to replace the old 5 shillings coin, alongside a new bill of 20 <b>kwacha.</b> Ngwee coins with the denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 ngwee replacing the existing 1, 3, 6 pence, 1, and 2 shillings coins respectively.

50|$|Throughout the years, the Zambian {{currency}} suffered {{high rates}} of inflation forcing the Bank of Zambia to introduce high value denominations in 2003, including 20,000 and 50,000 <b>kwacha</b> bills to facilitate transactions.

5000|$|The name <b>kwacha</b> {{was first}} used in Zambia where the Zambian <b>kwacha</b> was {{introduced}} in 1968.

The tambala was so named because a hundred roosters announce the dawn.|$|E

50|$|The {{first issue}} of the first <b>kwacha</b> was issued in 1968.

The reverse showed different activity based themes reflecting life in Zambia. The banknotes were printed by Thomas De La Rue & Co. Limited, and bore the signature of Dr Justin B. Zulu, Bank of Zambia's second governor. Apart from the 50 ngwee banknote, the <b>kwacha</b> banknotes had president Kenneth Kaunda as a watermark. Specimen banknotes were issued for each denomination, with the word SPECIMEN overprint in red sans on both the obverse and reverse.|$|E
50|$|At {{the very}} beginning, the <b>kwacha</b> was pegged to the pound {{at a fixed}} rate of 1.7094 <b>kwacha</b> per 1 pound. Yet, after the {{devaluation}} of the dollar on August 15, 1971, Zambia broke all its currency's ties to the British monetary unit, and pegged the <b>kwacha</b> to the American monetary unit. These reforms resulted in a reduction of the kwacha's gold standard by 7.8%. A few months later, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer Anthony Barber, announced {{the demise of the}} Sterling area, and floatation of the sterling pound, causing Zambia to renounce the monetary privileges once enjoyed as a member state.|$|E
