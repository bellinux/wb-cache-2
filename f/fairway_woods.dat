Many modern sets tend to include hybrid clubs, which combine some of the characteristics of a wood and an iron, to replace the 5 wood and low-lofted irons.|$|E

5000|$|Higher-number woods are {{generally}} known as <b>fairway</b> <b>woods</b> and, as their name suggests, {{are designed for}} shots from off the turf of the fairway that still require long distance, such as the second shot of a par-5 or a long par-4 hole. They have two important features: a higher loft to lift {{the ball out of}} the turf and over low obstacles like hills, and a shallower face height which allows a player to hit a ball from the ground using the exact center of the club, providing greater distance for such shots. These two design features enable players to hit <b>fairway</b> <b>woods</b> off the ground with greater ease than modern deep-faced drivers. <b>Fairway</b> <b>woods</b> are also useful off the tee depending on the hole; players may for instance wish to play their tee shot short (known as [...] "laying up") due to a dogleg or a hazard in range of their driver, and will opt instead for their 3-wood. <b>Fairway</b> <b>woods</b> are typically made with a slightly shorter and stiffer shaft, a smaller clubhead and more loft than a driver or 2-wood.|$|E

5000|$|A hybrid {{generally}} {{features a}} head {{very similar to}} a fairway wood; hollow steel or titanium with a shallow, slightly convex face. A hybrid head is usually marginally shallower and does not extend backwards from the face {{as far as a}} comparable <b>fairway</b> <b>wood.</b> The head must have an iron-like lie angle, and therefore also has a flatter sole than a <b>fairway</b> <b>wood.</b> The face incorporates the [...] "trampoline" [...] effect common to most modern woods, in which the clubface deforms slightly, then returns to its previous shape, increasing the impulse applied to the ball at launch. The hybrid's lie, length and weight is comparable to an iron.|$|R

5000|$|In 1996, McCabe joined Titliest as the {{director}} of research & development. McCabe was hired by Wally Uihlein to revitalize the Titleist Brand into 'serious clubs for serious golfers'. [...] McCabe's first mission was to create a driver that would re-establish Titleist's Brand. The 975D driver later became the #1 driver on the PGA Tour. McCabe's designs included the 975D, 975E, 975EFS, 975LLF, 975LFE, 975J, 975JVS drivers. The 975F, 970, the retro PT13 and PT15 bore through <b>fairway</b> <b>woods.</b> The 681(played by Tiger Woods & Greg Norman), PM731(played by Phil Mickelson), 690MB, 690CB, & 680 forged irons.

5000|$|For many players, long irons (numbers 1-4) are {{difficult}} to hit well even with modern clubfaces, due to the low trajectory and very small face of the low-loft clubhead. Players tend to avoid these clubs in favor of <b>fairway</b> <b>woods</b> which have a larger [...] "sweet spot" [...] to hit with, but such woods, having longer shafts, have a different swing mechanic that is sometimes difficult to master. The long shaft of a fairway wood also requires lots of room to swing, making it unsuitable for tighter lies such as [...] "punching" [...] out from underneath trees. In addition, the fairway wood clubface is designed to skim over instead of cutting into turf, which makes it undesirable for shots from the rough. The answer to this dilemma for many players is to replace the 1-4 irons with hybrids.|$|E
50|$|Given {{the choices}} {{available}} to the modern golfer, and further de-lofting of pitching wedges (and all other irons) in the newest iron sets, it is almost unheard of anymore for a player to have only a pitching wedge and sand wedge. Gap wedges are ubiquitous in the modern club set, and sets of four total wedges {{are becoming more and}} more common. This usually comes at the cost of having to remove other clubs, often the long irons, from the bag in order to meet the 14-club limit; with a driver and two fairway irons or hybrids, for a player to have four wedges, they must start their numbered irons at the four-iron instead of the three. This in turn requires more attention paid to the selection of <b>fairway</b> <b>woods</b> or hybrids to produce more evenly-distributed average distances between the driver and the long to mid irons.|$|E
50|$|Woods {{fought off}} {{three of the}} best golfers {{in the world to}} win his third Open Championship title. While Els and García faded, DiMarco made a gritty rally to close with a 68 for a solo runner-up finish, two strokes back. After the {{clinching}} putt, Woods buried his head in the shoulder of caddie Steve Williams and sobbed uncontrollably, having won his first major since the passing of his father Earl Woods two months earlier. On the way to victory, Woods hit 86 percent of <b>fairways.</b> <b>Woods</b> became the first player since Tom Watson in 1982-83 to win golf's oldest championship in consecutive years. Woods improved his perfect record in majors to 11-0 when entering the final round with at least a share of the lead.|$|R

5000|$|In December 1959, Snead {{took part}} in a {{controversial}} match against Mason Rudolph, at the Mid Ocean Club in Bermuda. Snead decided to deliberately lose the televised match, played under the [...] "World Championship Golf" [...] series, during its final holes, after he discovered on the 12th hole that he had too many golf clubs in his bag. (A player is limited to 14 clubs during competitive rounds.) The match was tied at that stage. The extra club in his bag, a <b>fairway</b> <b>wood</b> Snead had been experimenting with in practice, would have caused him to be immediately disqualified according to the Rules of Golf, even though he did not use it during the round. After the match was over, Snead explained the matter, and said he did not disqualify himself in order not to spoil the show. The problem did not become known outside a small circle until the show was televised four months later. After the incident came to light, the sponsor cancelled further participation in the series.|$|R
50|$|The driver {{has become}} the most {{expensive}} single club of the modern clubset, largely due to the high emphasis placed on a player's drive distance; a longer drive gets the ball closer to the green in fewer strokes allowing for better chances of a birdie or eagle. While drivers are available as cheaply as $20, these are mainly marketed at junior players; the price range for drivers marketed to adult amateur players is generally between $130-$500, with custom-made clubs for high-end players and touring professionals costing thousands or even {{tens of thousands of dollars}} (in the case of prototype or preproduction clubs supplied by a sponsor club-maker). As a comparison, the upper end of the retail drivers, $500, is comparable to the price of an entire quality matched set of irons, and the next most expensive single clubs, the putter and the <b>fairway</b> <b>woods,</b> generally range from $100-$350.|$|E
5000|$|As a result, {{since the}} mid-80s {{the number of}} wedges {{available}} to players has grown from 2 (pitching and sand) to 5 (adding gap, lob and ultra lob), {{most of which are}} now available in a wide array of lofts and bounces to allow a player to [...] "fine-tune" [...] their short game with the wedges that best meet their needs. In some cases, with the high degree of customization, companies have done away with the traditional names for each club, and instead simply label each club with its loft and bounce angles. A 52-8 wedge, for example, would have 52 degrees of loft and 8 degrees of bounce, generally placing it in the [...] "gap wedge" [...] class. Most players carry three or four wedges on the course, and sometimes more, usually sacrificing one or two of their long irons and/or higher-lofted <b>fairway</b> <b>woods</b> to meet the 14-club limit.|$|E
5000|$|Long irons are {{traditionally}} {{regarded as the}} most difficult to hit, because their low loft gives them a very small striking face and [...] "sweet spot" [...] compared to higher-lofted irons. As such, they are less commonly seen in players' bags, usually replaced with higher-lofted <b>fairway</b> <b>woods</b> like the 5 and 7, or with hybrid clubs that have similar overall performance but are easier to hit. The 2-iron, like the driving iron, is virtually never seen in modern sets, due to both its difficulty and to a [...] "de-lofting" [...] of modern cavity-backed irons which increases the average distance of shorter irons. If the long irons are used, they are often seen with graphite shafts to add additional clubhead speed to the average golfer's swing by storing energy from the downswing and releasing it at impact. Hybrid clubs that replace these irons also often have graphite shafts for the same reason.|$|E
5000|$|Once this {{behavior}} {{is known to}} the player, {{it can be used}} to great effect. For instance, a player may be faced with a hole incorporating a hazard just in front of the green. A driver, low-loft <b>fairway</b> <b>wood</b> or long iron shot will roll significantly, and depending on the distance carried in the air the ball will either roll into the hazard with a resulting penalty, or roll past the green, which on many courses is difficult to recover from and may incorporate other hazards. Normally a player might hit a mid-iron shot designed to [...] "lay up" [...] in front of the hazard and then hit an [...] "approach" [...] shot with a wedge or short iron to carry over the hazard and onto the green. However, a hybrid with sufficient distance would allow the player to hit a shot that carries the full distance to the green in the air, but then [...] "sticks" [...] on the green relatively close to its impact point, allowing the player to make one stroke instead of two to get on the green.|$|R

50|$|In the 18-hole playoff, Brooks birdied {{the third}} hole and Goosen the sixth to pull even at one-under par. Brooks bogeyed {{the seventh and}} again at the ninth, while Goosen birdied it to go three strokes up at the turn. Brooks bogeyed #10 while Goosen birdied to take a five-shot lead with eight holes to be played. They halved the next six holes, all pars except bogeys at #12, and Goosen {{maintained}} his five-stroke lead with just two holes remaining. A two-shot swing in Brooks' favor at the 17th cut the lead to three, but Brooks, who struggled off the tee all day, sent his final drive into the right-hand rough. He chose a <b>fairway</b> <b>wood</b> for his approach and did well to run his ball into the bunker short and left of the final green. Goosen found the 18th fairway with his drive, then hit a five-iron that landed short of the green and rolled 20 yd back down the slope. Taking no chances with his tight uphill lie, Goosen used a putter to knock his ball onto the putting surface, leaving 25 ft for his par. Brooks blasted out of the trap to three feet and converted for par for a two-over 72. Goosen cautiously left his par putt five feet short, then rolled in the clinching putt for an even-par 70 and became just the sixth foreign-born winner of the U.S. Open in the last 70 years. The seemingly stoic 32-year-old became the third South African to win the title, joining countrymen Gary Player and Ernie Els as champions of the USGA's premier event.|$|R
