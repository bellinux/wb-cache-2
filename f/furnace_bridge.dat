2500|$|After {{finishing}} {{her shift}} in the dining hall, Welden returned {{to her room and}} changed into walking clothes. Her clothing was adequate for the weather that afternoon but not for the anticipated drop in temperature that night. She packed no bag, took no extra clothing, and did not take any extra money. From all appearances, she did not expect to be gone more than a few hours. Welden walked down the campus driveway and hitched a ride from State Route 67A near the college entrance in North Bennington to a point on State Route 9 near the <b>Furnace</b> <b>Bridge</b> between downtown Bennington and Woodford Hollow. Local contractor Louis Knapp picked her up and drove her as far as his house on Route 9, about [...] from the Long Trail. From this point, Welden either hitchhiked or walked {{the rest of the way}} to the start of the Long Trail in Woodford Hollow.|$|E

50|$|Redwell-Isabella Furnace Historic District is a {{historic}} iron furnace complex and national historic district located near Luray, Page County, Virginia. The district includes two contributing buildings, three contributing sites, and one contributing structure. The two buildings are the Isabella Furnace Office (c. 1800), a two-story stone building with Georgian interior detail, and the Yager Spring House (c. 1800), a two-story stone dwelling with a large cooking fireplace and a stone and frame addition made in 1965. Both buildings have metal-sheathed gable roofs. The district also includes a cemetery (now devoid of markers), a stone foundation, the <b>furnace</b> <b>bridge</b> mound, and Yager Spring, the power source for the furnace and later mills beginning about 1787.|$|E
50|$|Qingming jie, {{festival of}} the Pure Light. To the fifth {{month of the}} lunar calendar, the festival of the Pure Qingming Light is {{specifically}} devoted to the ancestors. On the family <b>furnace</b> <b>bridge</b> and the tombs, the ancestors of the family receive food offerings. Candles are lit, of the incense sticks are consumed. Very followed with the Meeting, this worship {{is one of the}} bases of the Chinese culture. One finds it in all the religious and spiritual practices of old China: Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism. Qingming jie is intended to honour the spirits with the members missing from the family so that they continue to rest in peace and take care on their descent.|$|E

5000|$|The Saint-Jean-Baptist Church {{is located}} near the vault Saint-Anthony, these two {{buildings}} being integrated in the [...] "Ways of the Baroque". It is impossible to determine the date of its construction, but {{it is certain that}} it existed already in 1376; it underwent many changes over the centuries. Like all the churches High-Maurienne, it possessed a closed hall. The vault of this hall is decorated in plaster existing already in 1827 and representing the miracle with the Holy Host in Turin. At the interior of the church, eight arched windows introduce enough light to make it possible to contemplate the vault with medallions. The sight is first of all attracted by the high altar, whose marble is of a beautiful Carrara marble white, decorated of a Jean-Baptist Saint on the front, of fine facets and drawings. The steps are with notched edges and, on the gate vault, a slim dome is profiled on four elegant posts. This <b>furnace</b> <b>bridge</b> was carried out in 1858. Four other small furnace bridges are on both sides nave of the church. They are dedicated to Saint Antoine, Notre-Dame du Mont-Carmel, Notre-Dame du Rosaire, and Saint Joseph. Inside the church are murals and religious statues carved by local artists. The bell-tower is of an ancient date. Its structure is the same one as that of the towers known as [...] "Sarrasines" [...] that one still finds throughout the valley. It is decorated of four bells ...|$|E
40|$|Book description: The carved retables of <b>furnace</b> <b>bridge,</b> {{receptacles}} of golds and images, {{played an}} essential part in the civilization of the Average late Age. The present synthesis intends to restore its importance with the production of Brussels, approached in its history, its conditions for implementation and production, its choices formal and iconographic like in its ritual and dévotionnelles functions. Falling under a prospect for anthropology historical, this multi-field study reinstates, and it is there one of the originalities of its step, our knowledge of these tables of <b>furnace</b> <b>bridge</b> {{in the context of}} the religious practices which caused their creation and defined their statute, new, “of space of communication with crowned”. Some from the best Belgian specialists and abroad gathered here, under the direction of Brigitte D' Hainaut-Zveny, to offer to the readers, who they are scientists or art lovers, a reference work, richly illustrated and together with a detailed catalogue...|$|E
50|$|Most pupils {{attending}} the school {{live within the}} catchment area, and transfer {{from one of the}} local junior schools: Maidenbower Junior School, Pound Hill Junior School, and Milton Mount Primary School. Other pupils travel from nearby neighbourhoods such as Three <b>Bridges,</b> <b>Furnace</b> Green, Tilgate, Broadfield, Ifield and Bewbush. The school is managed by a team of 10 senior management.|$|R
50|$|Originally a 2185 acre {{part of the}} Worth Forest, {{the park}} and the {{surrounding}} areas (including the modern day <b>Furnace</b> Green, Three <b>Bridges</b> {{and part of the}} Ashdown Forest) were part of the larger Tilgate estate, first recorded in 1647. From that time, industries including Ironworks and furnaces were dismantled and replaced by a landed working estate.|$|R
50|$|Rivers of Steel National Heritage Area is {{a federally}} {{designated}} National Heritage Area in southwestern Pennsylvania, centered on Pittsburgh and oriented around the interpretation {{and promotion of}} the region's steel-making heritage. The area roughly covers the valleys of the Ohio, Monongahela and lower Allegheny rivers. Major interpretive locations include the Carrie <b>Furnace,</b> Pinkerton's Landing <b>Bridge</b> and other features of the Homestead Steel Works.|$|R
50|$|Many {{attendant}} difficulties had to {{be overcome}} before this fuel {{could be applied to}} the purpose of smelting iron. Dudley does not describe in his book how he was using coal, only that he was. In so doing, he described his use successively of an ironworks on Pensnett Chase and at Cradley, of a furnace at Himley, and of a <b>furnace</b> at Hasco <b>Bridge</b> near Gornal.|$|R
50|$|The ore {{came from}} the Grubb's Chestnut Hill mine or from the Cornwall mines via the Union Canal to Lebanon. From there it was brought by wagon to the furnace. Water power from Manada Creek turned a wheel which {{operated}} the bellows that pumped air into the furnace. The water wheel was probably on {{the northeast corner of}} the <b>furnace.</b> A <b>bridge</b> from a hill led {{to the top of the}} furnace. Men dumped wheelbarrow loads of charcoal, limestone and iron ore into the top. The furnace produced pig iron and also did some casting of products. From 1837 to 1848 the furnace produced over 22,000 tons of iron. The metal was sent to the Swatara railroad station for transport.|$|R
5000|$|The furnace {{is roughly}} {{pyramidal}} in shape, 30 feet (9 m) square at the base, 15 feet (4.5 m) square at the top, and 45 feet (14 m) tall. It is built of large hematite blocks quarried from Dirt Cellar Mountain {{and brought the}} three miles (5 km) to the site by ox cart. [...] A half-mile (.8 km) long mill race was constructed from the Chattooga River through a tunnel under a hill to power a water wheel which provided the air blast to operate the <b>furnace.</b> A <b>bridge,</b> no longer extant, spanned from the hillside {{to the top of}} the stack, where iron ore was loaded into the furnace. A gristmill and sawmill were also located on the site.|$|R
500|$|Many bridges {{have been}} {{constructed}} across Roaring Creek {{and a number of}} covered bridges {{can be seen from the}} creek. The first bridge over the creek was constructed in 1874 at Slabtown for a cost of $1500. It was replaced in 1913 for a cost of $5500. The Davis Covered Bridge was built northwest of Slabtown in 1875 and repaired in 1997. It is [...] long and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Snyder Covered Bridge No. 17 was built over the creek southeast of Slabtown in 1876 and repaired in 2010. It is [...] long and is also on the National Register of Historic Places. The two-span Esther <b>Furnace</b> Covered <b>Bridge</b> was built over the creek in Cleveland Township in 1905. It is [...] long and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{this time}} Mayor Richards {{suggested}} {{to the president}} of Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) Sam Sloan that a spur be built from the DL&W into a part of Dover along {{the north side of the}} Rockaway River terminating at the Hibernia mines. Mr. Sloan turned down the idea, so Mr. Richards negotiating with landowners along what was to become the roadbed for his railroad. The primary object of this new railroad and the other railroads and branches was to carry the iron ore to the <b>furnaces</b> at High <b>Bridge</b> and in the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania for use with the Pennsylvania ores. George Richards took great satisfaction that the iron would come from New Jersey and the very first rails used were the product of the Dover Iron Works.|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} conductivity of {{samples of the}} Murchison and Allende carbonaceous chondrites is 4 to 6 magnitudes greater than rock forming minerals such as Olivine up to 700 C. The remarkably high {{electrical conductivity}} of these meteorites is attributed to carbon at grain boundaries. The environment {{in the wake of}} the space station can be exploited to produce conditions which will allow pyrolysis of carbonaceous chondrites. An experimental package consisting of a one square meter shield attached to a 15 cm diameter by 40 cm long furnace and tied to a conductance <b>bridge,</b> <b>furnace</b> controller, and digital voltmeter inside the space station via umbilical cable could make the required measurements. Since heating rates as low as 0. 1 C/hour are required to study kinetics of the pyrolysis reations which are the cause of the high conductivity of the carbonaceous chondrites, experimental times up to 3 months will be needed...|$|R
50|$|At its peak, the Union served eight {{separate}} {{steel mills}} {{and numerous other}} businesses (see below for complete list)- USS Homestead, USS Rankin, USS Edgar Thomson, USS Duquesne-National, USS National Tube & Pipe, USS Clairton,the relatively new USS Irvin rolling mill and Grant Steel in Duquesne, Pennsylvania. The URR also used four bridges crossing the Monongahela River - Union Railroad Port Perry Bridge, Union Railroad Clairton's Wyle Bridge, McKeesport Connecting Riverton Bridge (also known as: Union Railroad Riverton <b>Bridge),</b> Carrie <b>Furnace</b> Hot Metal <b>Bridge</b> (also known as: Union Railroad Rankin Hot Metal Bridge) - {{and was one of}} the busy railroads in the United States by tonnage hauled. Unlike the rest of the steel industry, the Union was relatively accepting of modernization as demonstrated by construction of a then state-of-the-art yard and dispatching center in Duquesne, Pennsylvania, in the early 1950s. With the decline of the steel industry in the United States, the Union's operations were greatly scaled back.|$|R
