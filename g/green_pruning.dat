40|$|Introduction: <b>Green</b> <b>pruning</b> {{or summer}} pruning completes winter pruning, {{and it is}} {{conducted}} during the growing season. The purpose of <b>green</b> <b>pruning</b> is to maximize yield of high quality grapes. <b>Green</b> <b>pruning</b> in fruit trees improves light penetration and increases the quality of fruits. The objectives of this research were to {{determine the influence of}} <b>green</b> <b>pruning</b> on fruit quantitative and qualitative attributes in grapevine cultivar 'keshmeshi'. Materials and Methods: The present research was undertaken in Shirvan, Northern Khorasan province. The vines were highly uniform, 17 years old and all had equal vegetative growth strength. The planting distances were 3 × 3 m. The present study was conducted on cultivar 'Keshmeshi' that is considered {{to be one of the}} best grapevine cultivars mostly used for raisin production as well as table fresh fruits. In order to evaluate the effect of <b>green</b> <b>pruning</b> on different quantitative and qualitative attributes of fruits in cultivar "keshmeshi", the experiment was carried out in two way randomized complete block design with 12 treatments and three replications. Vines were pruned three times including full bloom, two weeks after full bloom and veraison (eight weeks after full bloom). Pruning was carried out in three levels including tipping after two, four or six nodes above the final cluster. The characteristics studied were cluster weight, berry weight, cluster length and width, berry length and width, number of cluster and berry, vine yield, leaf area, soluble solid, total acidity, pH, berry color, berry sunscald and number of shot berry.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of nitrogen fertilization combined with <b>green</b> <b>pruning</b> intensity on fruit quality of ‘Chimarrita’ from high density peach trees during three consecutive harvest seasons. For this purpose, urea composed of different nitrogen rates (0, 40, 80, 120, 160, 200 and 240 kg. ha- 1. year- 1) was applied, under two intensities of <b>green</b> <b>pruning</b> (annual – once per season; or continuous – four times per season) in a factorial scheme (7 × 2). Fruits have been subjected to physical, chemical and sensorial analysis, made by 60 non-trained evaluators in each of the harvest seasons. The results showed that the cumulative effect of applying N in the third harvest season improved SS attributes, SS/TA ratio and fruit skin color to the dose of N of 148 kg. ha- 1. year- 1.

In this paper we discuss the most appropriate practices to preserve soil fertility and improve the efficiency of water and mineral resources. Soil incorporation of <b>green</b> manure, <b>pruned</b> material and mature compost can play an interesting role in reducing the chemical inputs in agriculture, improving the organic matter content of the soil and restoring its biological fertility.

The knowledge of the uptake of mineral elements and their partitioning in the different plant organs during the annual cycle, and reserves accumulation and mobilisation is necessary in order to synchronise the supply of nutrients with plant requests. The use of fertigation is recommended, as it combines efficient use of water resources with rational use of fertilisers.

40|$|Wine quality {{depends on}} many factors, {{such as the}} choice of variety, stock, {{training}} system, pruning as well as environmental parameters and cultivation techniques performed in the vineyard. Monitoring the micro-climate of grapevine allows to conveniently perform the most important cultivation techniques (soil management, pesticide treatments, <b>green</b> <b>pruning,</b> harvest) thus reducing the operating costs of the vineyard, and increasing {{the overall quality of}} the grapes. The aim of the present study is to monitor the micro-climate of grapevine in order to control spring period hazards, to reduce the operating costs of the vineyard and to increase the quality of grapes. For this purpose a Wireless Sensor Network was used, and a comparison was performed between the data measured by wireless sensors and data provided by a fixed meteorological station of the local government agency (SIAS - Regione Siciliana). The results obtained here showed that, with reference to temperature, the data measured by wireless sensors are considerable different from the data of SIAS measuring station especially for temperatures above 20 °C. With reference to relative humidity, there are no differences between the two types of sensors. Our study showed that the microclimate of the vineyard may be considerably different from the climate of the macro-area closest to the plot.

50|$|In {{the absence}} of other techniques, makers of dessert wine have to produce their sugar in the vineyard. Some grape varieties, such as Muscat, Ortega and Huxelrebe, {{naturally}} produce a lot more sugar than others. Environmental conditions have a big effect on ultimate sugar levels; the vigneron can help by leaving the grapes on the vine until they are fully ripe, and by <b>green</b> harvesting and <b>pruning</b> to expose the young grapes to the sun. Green harvesting reduces the number of bunches on a vine early in the summer, so that the sugar production of the leaves is divided between fewer bunches. Unfortunately the vigneron cannot control the sun, but a sunny year can help sugar levels a lot. The semi-sweet Auslese wines in the German wine classification are probably {{the best example of}} this approach; most modern winemakers perceive that their customers want either fully dry or 'properly' sweet dessert wines, so 'leave it to nature' is currently out of fashion. But most of the Muscats of ancient times were probably made this way, including the famous Constantia of South Africa.|$|R

The permutations of these option sketches for all sides and forces are assembled and passed to a new kind of combat model which generates many qualitatively different possible futures. These possible futures are organized into a graph-like structure. The commander can explore the space of possible futures, conducting “what-if ” drills and generating branch and sequel options. Deep Green will take information from the ongoing, current operation to estimate the likelihood that the various possible futures may occur.

An overall vision for the Deep Green concept is an innovative approach to using simulation to support ongoing military operations while they are being conducted. By using information acquired from the ongoing operation, rather than assumptions made during the planning phase, commanders and staffs can make more informed choices and focus on building options for futures that are becoming more likely.

During the last survey, the possibility to combine remote sensing data and in-situ PocketLAI estimates (smart scouting) was evaluated. Results showed a good agreement between PocketLAI data and direct measurements, especially for LAI ranging from 0. 13 to 1. 41 (R 2 = 0. 94, RRMSE = 17. 27 %), whereas the accuracy decreased when an outlying value (vineyard LAI = 2. 84) was included (R 2 = 0. 77, RRMSE = 43. 00 %), due to the saturation effect in case of very dense canopies arising from lack of <b>green</b> <b>pruning.</b> The hemispherical photography showed very high values of R 2, even in presence of the outlying value (R 2 = 0. 94), although it showed a marked and quite constant overestimation error (RRMSE = 99. 46 %), suggesting the need to introduce a correction factor specific for vineyards.

The experimental factors are Saw Type (tipped saw, original saw, filed saw), Size of Twig (8 mm, 12 mm, 18 mm), Cutting Speed (fast, slow), Species of Twig (Sugi, Hinoki), Cutting Angle (90 °, 45 °), and Moisture Condition of twig (dry, wet, live). We investigated these factors {{according to the}} experimental designs of orthogonal array L_ (3 _). The results are as follows; we can make cutting time shorter on cutting a twig "fast" and perpendicullarly to longitudinal direction of a twig, and save cutting energy with a thin edge blade and at "fast" Cutting Speed. But on the other hand, we need to prune at "slow" Cutting Speed and perpendicularly to longitudinal direction of a twig for preventing from the defects such as hang-nails or splits {{on the surface of}} the pruned tree. As pruning operation is popularly performed in drywinter season, so it is important to pay extra attention to pruning "small" twigs, which are apt to split電動丸鋸による枝打ち作業について鋸断性能と鋸断表面の仕上がり状態を調べるために, 歯形 (チップドソー, 鋸歯, 目立て歯), 枝の径 (8 mm, 12 mm, 18 mm), 鋸断速度 (速, 遅), 枝の樹種 (スギ, ヒノキ), 鋸断角度 (90 °, 45 °) および枝の乾燥状態 (乾, 湿, 生) の 6 因子を取り上げ, 直交表L_ (3 _) に従って実験計画を組み各因子の要因分析を行った。その結果, 枝軸に直角に素早く枝打ちすることで, 鋸断時間は短縮され, 一方鋸断速度を"速", 刃先の厚みの薄い歯を使用することで鋸断消費エネルギーは少なくなるが, しかし鋸断表面の仕上がり状態を良くするには鋸断速度を遅く, 枝軸に直角に当てる枝打ちがよい。また枝打ちは冬期の乾燥時期が最盛期であるから, 枝打ち面の割れ等を防ぐために, 小さい枝を打つときは特に注意が肝要である...|$|E
40|$|Grape {{vineyard}} culture practices including nitrogen fertilization, {{removal of}} leaves, and thinning of clusters, {{as well as}} fungicide treatments were evaluated for their effect {{on the development of}} Botrytis bunch rot. High nitrogen fertilization predisposed grapevines to infec-tion by Botrytis cinerea and increased disease severity. Latent infection of cups and berries as well as visible in-fection of clusters increased as the rate of ammonium nitrate amendment increased. Conversely, removal of leaves around clusters, when practiced two or three times during the season, and thinning of berries signifi-cantly reduced Botrytis bunch rot development and re-sulted in less latent and visibly infected clusters and berries. These <b>green</b> <b>pruning</b> practices also attenuated the beneficial effects of nitrogen fertilization on disease development. In vitro experiments revealed that among the tested fungicides, Vinchlozoline, Chlorothalonil, and Dichlofluanide were effective in completely inhibit-ing the germination of conidia. Iprodione and Pro-cymedone were apparently confronted to the problem of fungal resistance. Folpel, Copper and Chlorothalonil were not able to control mycelial growth as effectively as conidial germination. Field experiments showed that all tested fungicides significantly reduced disease com-pared to the untreated control, but Methyl-thiophanate, Dichlofluanide and Vinchlozoline provided the best control and gave a more than 60 % reduction in infect-ed clusters and approximately 40 % increase in yield as compared to the control. Incidence of Botrytis infection was significantly influenced by the period of fungicide application during bloom. The best results are obtained with the fungicide applied early during bloom.

The same measurements were done on a mature olive orchard, in order to find correlations between the rate of CO 2 fixation and the age of plants. In young orchard, fixed CO 2 has been allotted mainly in wood, while the rest in leaves and fruits.

40|$|The {{present study}} is {{conducted}} {{in the framework of}} the project IQuaSoPO. financed by the regional funds for rural development of Basilicata Region (Italy). It is a three year project which aims to transfer good sustainable practices to local fruit producers. One of the main expected results of the project is to develop guidelines for the calculation of carbon footprint of peaches and apricots, in a life cycle perspective, referred to the productive and geographical specificities of Metapontino area. These guidelines will be used by the local producer to easily assess and communicate the environmental sustainability of their products, which, in this way, will gain added value on the market. Three experimental fields for the production of peaches and apricots in the area of Metaponto are involved in the transfer of knowledge process, about carbon management and water management sustainable practices, which can influence the entity of GHG emissions, by favouring the accumulation of important amounts of carbon and nitrogen in soil and in the perennial parts of peach tree (trunks, branches, roots). Examples of these sustainable management practices are: reduced tillage, soil grass cover, recycling of pruned materials within the field, deficit controlled irrigation, use of compost. In the framework of this study, the three pilot sites are used for inventory data collection, calculation of the carbon footprint, and development of the guidelines. The whole life cycle of the orchards is considered from the tree nursery stage (one or two years), through the establishment, the young, mature and decay stages, and the final destruction, for an average of 15 years. All the agricultural operations have been included in the accounting, in terms of energy consumption and machinery utilization: soil tillage, thinning, pruning, mulching, harvesting, fertilization, plant protection, irrigation, harvesting. Moreover, the life cycle of all the constituent materials of the orchard’s plant and cover structure has been considered (steel wire, cement and aluminum poles, cement blocks, irrigation pipes and water distribution final devices), as well as all the productive inputs’ life cycle (pests and fertilizers). Not just the production phase of the nitrogen fertilizers has been considered, but also the N 2 O emissions derived from their use. Two different functional units have been used: one kg of peaches/apricot produced and one hectare of cultivated field. The most innovative part of the present study consists in the integration of GHG fluxes occurring within soil-tree-atmosphere system, into the carbon footprint assessment: our aim is to estimate the soil carbon content change, in the considered time boundaries of the study (medium term perspective), related to soil respiration, plant growing, <b>green</b> and brown <b>pruning</b> decomposition, organic compost utilization, cover crop, through sampling activities at field, and using formulas from literature and different models recently emerging in the international scientific community.

The variables evaluated included grapevine production for the two crops, the leaf area index (LAI) throughout the vegetative cycle, and the content of reserves in the branches in the following stages: 2007 WP, first crop flowering, GP on 11 - 15 - 07, GP on 12 - 17 - 07, post-harvest of first and second crop, and 2008 WP. The WP associated to GP allowed to obtain two harvests in all cultivars being more effective in the T 3. The shoots emitted by GP caused changes in the LAI and affected the dynamic of synthesis/ consumption of reserves in the branches of the grapevines. In plants with GP, there was reduction in the content of reserves {{at the end of the}} crop cycle compared to control plants.

On the management of production, data on the different speed at which the tested cultivars start to flowering after planting are reported. Starting from the primordia of an accessory bud, the apical meristem became “mature” growing in the time with important differences between the cultivars, acquiring only in the second year of growth for ‘Arbequina’ and ‘Koroneiki’ (early bearing cultivars) the capability to produce principal lateral buds able to develop in the inflorescences: with ‘Frantoio’ the “aging” of two years is not enough to move the principal lateral buds to develop inflorescences: this cultivar start to flower only after four years of growth. On the management of the canopy, it is shown the different fate of buds at the same node {{at the time of its}} formation. At the base of each leaf two different types of lateral buds are present: the main lateral bud, characterized by a reproductive function, and one or more small accessory buds specialized for develop new vegetative branches reiterating the cycle. The apical meristem of new shoots (suckers) from accessory buds give rise to a new cycle of “aging” for the next production. Tipping or cutting the distal part of the branches determines the sprouting of the nearest to cut distal principal buds (acrotony), with new shoots formation (feathers) having the same “age” of the forming apical meristem. The use of pruning to obtain new vegetative shoots from latent secondary buds or bearing vegetation from mature principal lateral buds by summer topping at different level makes it possible an innovative canopy management, through the application of <b>green</b> <b>pruning</b> in olive trees...|$|E

A desfolha associada ?? ??poca normal aumentou a produ????o por planta e o n??mero de cachos na Bord?? e sem diferen??as para a cultivar BRS Violeta. O albedo m??dio para os tratamentos BNC, BTC, BTS, VNC, VTC e VTS foi respectivamente, 0, 287, 0, 280, 0, 295, 0, 297, 0, 304 e 0, 287. A cultivar BRS Violeta apresentou maior disponibilidade de radia????o solar ao n??vel dos cachos e maior teor de s??lidos sol??veis totais na colheita quando comparada a cultivar Bord??. A ??poca de poda seca n??o representou diferen??a na quantidade de radia????o solar dispon??vel ao n??vel dos cachos, j?? a realiza????o da desfolha propiciou aumento na radia????o que incide ao n??vel dos cachos para a cv. Bord??. A radia????o solar dispon??vel ao n??vel dos cachos mostrou-se relacionada ao ac??mulo de s??lidos sol??veis totais, sendo maior este ac??mulo quando a radia????o dispon??vel foi maior na cultivar Bord??. In {{order to}} reach the strengthening {{and the development of}} family agriculture as well as the premise of diversification of the productive sources, there appears as an alternative the cultivation of common vineyards destined to the production of home-grown wine, juices and derivatives. Attempts were made to evaluate the existing relationships among local meteorological variables and handling practices, dry pruning and <b>green</b> <b>pruning</b> and the effects on phenological behavior, productive aspects and {{on the quality of the}} cultivated grape under the conditions of the region of Pelotas/RS. For this purpose, a family based agricultural property was selected located in the 8 TH district of Pelotas/RS, in which the experiment was carried out and where the experimental delineation was composed for a (2 x 2 x 2) factorial, these being: (Bord?? and BRS Violeta) cultivar, period of dry pruning (normal and late) and <b>green</b> <b>pruning</b> (with and without defoliation). Evaluations were carried out during harvest of total soluble solids, of the mass of clusters, of the number of clusters of grapes per cluster and production per plant. Moreover, global solar radiation was measured in each treatment, reflected by the canopy and available at the level of clusters as well as the daily temperature of the vineyards, Results demonstrate that the period of dry pruning affected the production and the accumulation of total soluble solids and on cv. BRS Violeta, only the total soluble solids. When relating the period of dry pruning with defoliation over total soluble solids, these differed only in the treatment with defoliation, being greater in the late period. Defoliation carried out on cv. Bord?? reduced the number of grapes per cluster. However, it increased weight of the clusters and presented no differences for the BRS Violeta. Defoliation associated with the normal period increased the production per plant and the number of clusters on Bord?? and presented no differences on the cv. BRS Violeta. The results demonstration that the average albedo presented short variation 0, 287, 0, 280, 0, 295, 0, 297, 0, 304 e 0, 287 for the respectively treatments BNC, BTC, BTS, VNC, VTC and VTS, being B e V refer of the cultivars Bord?? and BRS Violeta, N and T of the dry pruning and C and S with and without. The cv. BRS Violeta presented greater availability of solar radiation at the level of clusters and higher rate of total soluble solids during harvest when compared with cv. Bord??. The period of dry pruning did not represent difference in the quantity of solar radiation available at the level of clusters but the defoliation propitiated increase in incident radiation a the level of clusters for cv. Bord?? and BRS Violeta. Solar radiation available at the level of clusters showed itself related to the accumulation of total soluble solids, being greater when the available radiation was greater on cv. Bord??...|$|E
40|$|The {{anatomical}} {{and chemical}} host responses of two economically important Eucalyptus species grown in southern Australia (E globulus and E. nitens) to different wounding treatments (mechanical, chemical and biological) were investigated. Initially, the project primarily {{focused on the}} role of kino veins as barrier zones in eucalypt tree defence but then later also included the characterization of the new tissue formed subsequent to wounding, an area of study previously never been studied in any eucalypt species. The developmental anatomy and structure of kino veins was examined in three juvenile Eucalyptus species (E. nitens, E. globulus and E. obliqua) to treatment with an ethylenereleasing compound, 2 -chloroethyl phosphonic acid (CEPA). Unlike E. globulus and E. obliqua, E. nitens failed to produce kino veins in response to the hormone treatment, confirming anecdotal evidence that this species does not readily form kino veins. During this study, histochemical stains including p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde (DMACA) and Coomassie brilliant blue G- 250 (BBG- 250) were refined to allow the localization of condensed tannins and hydolyzable tannins, respectively in wood sections. The production of dark extractives (non-structural components of wood and bark) was regularly observed as part of the wound response in both the phloem and/or xylem tissue and regardless of the cause of injury. The various wound treatments examined included drill wounding with fungal inoculations, dry ice wounding, natural infection to stem canker (Cytonaema sp.) and prune wounding. Analysis of dark extractives extracted from the new tissue formed after wounding using gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV) coupled to negative ion electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) revealed that a complex range of secondary metabolites was present, including hydrolyzable tannins, proanthocyanidins, flavonone glycoside, stilbene glycosides, formylated phloroglucinol compounds (FPCs) and volatile terpenes. These compounds were either undetectable in healthy tissue or else present at significantly lower concentrations than in wound-associated tissue. In particular, the detection of FPCs in the wound-associated wood was a novel finding, hitherto detected in the leaves of various eucalypt species. We suggest that the diverse range of secondary metabolites detected in the wound-associated tissue may have a multi-functional role in relation to tree wound repair and defence. Crude wound wood extracts were shown to possess in vitro antimicrobial activity against decay fungi and gram-positive bacteria as well as in vitro antioxidant activity. We detail the first reported case of traumatic oil glands induced by wounding in eucalypts. Histological examinations revealed the new phloem tissue formed in the two years following <b>green</b> <b>pruning</b> in 5 -year-old E. globulus to be largely composed of secretory cavities similar in appearance to oil glands. Subsequent analysis of extracts by GC-MS confirmed the presence of volatile terpenes and phenols. The total oil content determined for wound associated phloem extracts was significantly higher (> 50 times) than for healthy stem phloem extracts. Based on these chemical and morphological findings, we propose a reassessment of the importance of wound wood in tree compartmentalization response for E. globulus and E. nitens, particularly in comparison with other woody tree species...|$|E
40|$|The oenological {{interest}} in the autochthonous yeast applications has increased since they represents an important supplement to wine quality (Martinez et al. 1989; Moreno et al. 1991). Yeast populations harboured {{onto the surface of}} berries and in musts of “Grillo” grape variety were isolated and analyzed. In order to obtain a first blastomycetic mapping of Marsala wine production area, eight vineyards were chosen on the basis of different climatic and agronomic parameters, including altitude, exposure,vineyard age, grape biotype, grape cultivation system, vegetative vigour, pruning, <b>green</b> <b>pruning,</b> yield per plant, phytosanity state, irrigation and closeness to wood areas. Analysis of blastomycetic populations was performed by cell counts on specific culture media for yeasts. Cell concentrations were evaluated on grapes and unfermented musts and during spontaneous must micro-fermentations at different times (after 3 and 13 days). Furthermore, during micro-fermentations non-Saccharomyces populations were distinguished from presumptive Saccharomyces based on the appearance of colonies after growth onto Wallerstein Laboratory (WL) nutrient agar (Pallman et al. 2001). Non-Saccharomyces reached about 106 - 107 CFU/ml both at the third and at the thirteenth day, while Saccharomyces exhibited variable cell concentrations, in particular, the majority of experiments showed level around 104 CFU/ml at the third day and almost all samples reached level of about 106 CFU/ml at the thirteen day. Saccharomyces cell concentrations positively correlated with weight loss registered during fermentations, since higher weight loss values were found in samples with their higher levels. After colony morphology inspection, 54 isolates were collected from grapes and unfermented musts and 60 during must micro-fermentations after 3 and 13 days, forming a total of 114 isolates. They were clustered into eight groups and into nine groups by optical microscopic observation of cell morphologies. Strain typing and differentiation was carried out by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD-PCR) (Moschetti et al. 1998) and the band patterns were analyzed by means of the unweighted pair group method using arithmetic average clustering algorithm (UPGMA). The representative strains of each group are being genetically identified. So far, analysis of D 1 /D 2 region of the 26 S rRNA gene revealed the presence of Candida zampliinina, Hanseniaspora uvarum, Issatchenkia terricola, Metschnikovia pulkerrima, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Zygosaccharomyces bailii. Moreover, the study was specifically oriented to the Saccharomyces spp. strains, which were isolated from musts fermented for 21 days using a “modified ethanol sulphite agar” (MESA), prepared from ESY medium. A total of 42 cultures were collected and 28 presumptive Saccharomyces yeasts, as selected by microscopic observation, were confirmed to be Saccharomyces spp. through amplification of ITS- 5. 8 S rRNA region (Esteve-Zarzoso et al. 1999). All the isolates were typed as above reported. The representative strains of each group were characterized for technological traits with {{interest in}} wine production such as hydrogen sulphide production, ethanol tolerance and potassium metabisulphide resistance. Strains showing the best performance were used to carry out “Grillo” must micro-fermentations lasting 13 days to select yeast starter cultures. The work is still in progress...|$|E
