500|$|In Cobb's view, the {{transfer}} of personnel to the yawl may have been intended as a temporary safety measure. He speculated from Deveau's report {{on the state of}} the rigging and ropes that the ship's main <b>halliard</b> may have been used to attach the yawl to the ship, enabling the company to return on board when the danger had passed. If, however, the line had subsequently parted, Mary Celeste would have sailed away empty leaving the yawl to founder with its occupants. Begg notes the illogicality of attaching the yawl to a vessel that the crew thought was about to explode or sink, while the modern writer Macdonald Hastings asks whether Briggs, an experienced captain, would have effected a panicky abandonment of the ship when, [...] "If the Mary Celeste had blown her timbers, she would still have been a better bet for survival than the ship's boat." [...] If this is what happened, says Hastings, Briggs [...] "...behaved like a fool; worse, a frightened one." ...|$|E
2500|$|A variant with {{a smaller}} {{implosion}} sphere, fewer explosive lenses, and some other changes was intended for the Blue Streak missile that was unable to carry Green Bamboo. However, the reduced size was achieved by reducing {{the size of the}} surrounding HE layers, and this resulted in less compression at the fissile core when detonated, and a reduced nuclear efficiency, and yield; meaning that less of the fissile material was consumed before the bomb blew itself apart. To compensate for the reduced compression more fissile material was required to maintain yield at the desired level, and this in turn made excessive demands on scarce and expensive fissile material. Estimates computed from reliable sources of actual core cost and cost per kilogram of HEU put the core sizes of Green Bamboo and Orange Herald as 98kg and 125kg respectively, although some other published (and unverified) sources claim [...] lower figures of 87kg and 117kg respectively. This design later became known as Orange Herald, and was tested at Christmas Island, yielding 720 kt. These two weapons, Green Bamboo and Orange Herald were intended as the two hybrid weapon predecessors of the first British thermonuclear weapons, based on the Granite design series that began with Short Granite, Purple Granite, Grapple X, Grapple Y, and Flagpole and <b>Halliard</b> at Grapple Z.|$|E

60|$|The lugger {{had managed}} to bring her head {{sufficiently}} up into the wind for her broadside guns to bear, and the shot came hurtling overhead.

60|$|They had the <b>halliard</b> {{in their}} hands, and the sail was half set, when it blew out {{suddenly}} {{and there was}} a sharp creaking. The sloop slanted over wildly and a curious humming, rippling sound broke out to windward. Glancing around a moment Frank saw that the swell was growing white, and a rush of cold wind nearly whipped his cap away. Then jamming his feet against a ledge with the deck sloping away beneath him he struggled furiously to hoist the jib, while disjointed cries reached him from the helmsman.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want your}} help, Miss Haldane. Go forward and loose the rope {{you will find}} on your {{right-hand}} side near the mast," [...] I said; and as the girl obeyed, the light shone more fully upon the dripping boat. I had a momentary vision of several dark figures on the veranda, and then, while I held my breath, saw only the slight form of the girl, with draggled dress and wet hair streaming, swung out above the whiteness of rushing foam as she wrenched at the <b>halliard,</b> which had fouled. Then {{the head of the}} sail swung down, and as she came back panting, the steering demanded all my attention.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, when I came to, it was calm, {{and there}} was the dead shark floatin' beside me. I paddled my spar over to him and I got loose a few yards of <b>halliard</b> that were hangin' from one end of it. I made a clove-hitch round his tail, d'ye see, and got the end of it slung over the spar and fastened, so as I couldn't lose him. Then I set to work and I ate him in a week right up to his back fin, and I drank the rain that fell on my coat, and when I was picked up by the Gracie of Gloucester, I was that fat that I could scarce climb aboard. That's what Ephraim Savage means, my lad, when he says that he is a baddish man to beat." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{man nodded}} {{and made his}} way forward; he endeavoured to carry out the first part of his orders, but the moment he raised the floor-board above the level of the gunwale it was {{wrenched}} from his hands and blown ahead. With the aid of two other men he managed to step the mast. The mate waved his hand to him to say that that would do for the present. The man, however, prepared the sail ready for hoisting, rolling it up tightly and winding a cord round and round it; then he hooked the head on to the traveller on the mast, and lay down at its foot, holding the <b>halliard</b> in readiness to hoist it. The water was still perfectly smooth, and the boat flew straight before the wind without any tendency to broach to. Stephen, after the stroke-oar had gone forward, crept aft until he was beside the mate, and there lay for a time, feeling half-stupefied by the tremendous roar of the cyclone.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think that's about {{enough for}} you to {{remember}} in one day, young masters," [...] John Lirriper said. [...] "You bear all that in your mind, and remember that each <b>halliard</b> and sheet has the name of the sail to which it is attached, and you will have learnt enough to make yourself useful, and can lend a hand when the skipper calls out, `Haul in the jib sheet,' or `Let go the fore halliards.' Now sit yourselves down again and see what is doing. That beacon you can just see right ahead marks the end of the Whittaker Spit. When we get there we shall drop anchor till the tide turns. You see we are going across it now, but when we round that beacon we shall have it dead against us, and the wind would be too light to take us against it even if it were not from the quarter it is. You see there are two or three other craft brought up there." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{boat was}} {{provided}} with a light mast, which could be stepped or unstepped at pleasure, {{and there were two}} stays of twisted leather, one fastening to each side of the boat. An iron ring with a cord travelled up and down the mast, the <b>halliard</b> running through a small block, as Luka had been able to obtain a sheave at Turukhansk. The sail was a lug made of sheeting, oiled, and the boat carried beside a triangular sail of very much smaller dimensions and stouter cloth for heavy weather. She also carried a small mizzen mast and sail. In rough weather the cockpit could be completely covered with a light apron with openings where the rowers sat, with a sort of collar, which could be lashed tightly round their waists. The edges of this apron could be lashed down over the gunwale round the cockpit. When completed the canoe itself, with its mast and sails, weighed but sixty pounds, and could be carried with ease by one person on his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Frank {{glanced at}} the short seas which surged by, {{glittering}} in the moonlight flecked with wisps of snowy froth, and it struck him {{by the way the}} boat swung over them with the foam boiling about her that she was carrying sufficient canvas in her mainsail. Then Harry, calling to him to mind his steering, hauled on a <b>halliard</b> and a mass of thrashing canvas rose up the mast. It blew out like a half-filled balloon, lifting up the boom, which was run out on the opposite side to the mainsail, and seemed bent on soaring skyward over the masthead. After that the boom swung forward with a crash, the mast strained and rattled, and Frank feared that the great loose sail would tear it out of the boat. He saw Harry lifted off his feet and flung upon the deck, after which the forward part of the boat was swept by flying ropes and billowy folds of canvas, among which his companion seemed to be futilely crawling to and fro. Presently his voice reached Frank hoarse and breathless.|$|E
60|$|But not an inch {{of canvas}} did she lower, but floundered on in her stolid fashion, while a little black ball ran up to her peak, and the rare old flag {{streamed}} suddenly out from the <b>halliard.</b> Then again came the rap, rap, rap, of her little guns, and the boom, boom of the big carronades in the bows of the lugger. An instant later the three ships met, and the merchant-man staggered on like a stag with two wolves hanging to its haunches. The three became but a dark blurr amid the smoke, with the top spars thrusting out in a bristle, and {{from the heart of}} that cloud came the quick red flashes of flame, and such a devils' racket of big guns and small, cheering and screaming, as was to din in my head for many a week. For a stricken hour the hell-cloud moved slowly across the face of the water, and still with our hearts in our mouths we watched the flap of the flag, straining to see if it were yet there. And then suddenly, the ship, as proud and black and high as ever, shot on upon her way; and as the smoke cleared we saw one of the luggers squattering like a broken winged duck upon the water, and the other working hard to get the crew from her before she sank.|$|E

50|$|In sailing, a halyard or <b>halliard</b> {{is a line}} (rope) that is used {{to hoist}} a ladder, sail, flag or yard. The term halyard comes from the phrase, 'to haul yards'. Halyards, like most other parts of the running rigging, were classically made of natural fibre like manila or hemp.|$|E
50|$|The Aran islanders, {{like the}} Blasket islanders further south, were assiduous {{users of the}} curach. Unusually for the area a sail was used, though without shrouds or stays. Apart from the <b>halliard,</b> the only ropes were the tack, led to a point near the stem, and the sheet, carried aft and secured to the last thwart.|$|E
50|$|Kerry currachs had a {{reputation}} for elegance and speed. All were fitted for sailing, with a short mast without shrouds stepped in a socket in a short mast shoe. The <b>halliard</b> was rove through an iron ring near the masthead, hoisting a small lug sail, and this was controlled by a sheet and tack. When under sail lee-boards might be employed.|$|E
5000|$|Nic Jones {{was born}} on 9 January 1947 in Orpington, London, [...] where his father owned a newsagent's shop. The family moved to Brentwood in Essex when Nic was two, and he later {{attended}} Brentwood School. He first learned to play guitar as a young teenager and early musical influences included such artists as The Shadows, Duane Eddy, Chet Atkins, Wes Montgomery and Ray Charles. His interest in folk music was aroused by an old school friend, Nigel Paterson (musician) {{who was a member}} of a folk band called The <b>Halliard.</b> When the members of the group decided to turn professional, one of them left to pursue a different career and Nic was invited to take his place. Whilst playing with The <b>Halliard,</b> Jones learned to play the fiddle and also how to research and arrange traditional material. The group toured the UK between 1964 and 1968, eventually splitting up when two of the members decided to pursue careers outside the folk music business.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Proa: single mast with crab claw sail. The sail {{need not}} have a curved leech and may be {{identical}} to the sail above, with identical spars, sheet and <b>halliard.</b> But the sail is not tacked but shunted; the bow becomes the stern, and the mast rake is also reversed. The vessel therefore always has the ama (and sidestay, if there is one) to windward, and has no bad tack.|$|E
50|$|The lateen style {{triangular}} shaped sail {{was used}} in the Mediterranean as early as the Antique time. With the week winds frequent in the Mediterranean basin, the lateen sail quickly replaced other forms of sails as it made sailing against the wind possible. The rig was commonly consisting of the mast, the lanteen with a triangular sail attached to it, the <b>halliard</b> for raising the lanteen, the parrel (usually placed on the left mast side); a sequence of thin short ropes on the sail for shortening it, the tacking rig used for insuring the front lateen end, and the sheet or poža / škota for keeping in place the back sail end.|$|E

Surviving {{a barrage of}} Confederate gun fire without serious injury, Vifquain ordered a general charge of the fort by his unit. During the ensuing fighting, Vifquain used his sword to sever the <b>halliard</b> holding up the fort's Confederate flag while the flag-bearer of the Ninety-Seventh Illinois planted the Union flag in its place. The flag-bearer was killed by Confederate gun fire immediately after placing the flag. Vifquain was concealed by the falling Confederate flag during the attack, so he was not targeted. Vifquain survived the battle and was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.|$|E
50|$|On March 19, 1861, Captain Trevanion T.

The surrender took place without military engagement, but not without tension. The Union soldiers garrisoned at the base cut the <b>halliard</b> of the flag-pole after the Federal flag was removed {{in order to prevent}} the Confederate flag being raised. They then set fire to the barracks as they were withdrawing. Sykes took quick action to aid in extinguishing the fire to preserve the barracks and nearby buildings. In June 1861, after the outbreak of the Civil War, Fort Clark was garrisoned by companies C and H, Second Regiment of Texas Mounted Rifles, with Capt. H. A. Hamner as post commander. In August 1862 all Confederate troops were withdrawn from Fort Clark.|$|E
