In the period after the storm's passage, the United States provided humanitarian aid and <b>economic</b> <b>assistance</b> to the country, helping the archipelago to reverse the effects of Beryl.|$|E
5|$|From 1945 to 1947 Molotov {{took part}} in all four {{conferences}} of foreign ministers of the victorious states in World War II. In general, he was distinguished by an uncooperative attitude towards the Western powers. Molotov, {{at the direction of}} the Soviet government, condemned the Marshall Plan as imperialistic and claimed it was dividing Europe into two camps, one capitalist and the other communist. In response, the Soviet Union, along with the other Eastern Bloc nations, initiated {{what is known as the}} Molotov Plan. The plan created several bilateral relations between the states of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union; and later evolved into the Council for Mutual <b>Economic</b> <b>Assistance</b> (CMEA).|$|E

5|$|In 1955, Washington pumped USD322.4 {{million into}} South Vietnam, and the {{historian}} George McTurnan Kahin calculated that 87% of this {{came through the}} CIP. From the end of 1955, when Diem took full {{control of the country}} after ousting Bảo Đại and declaring himself president, until 1961, the US provided Saigon with USD1.447 billion in aid, mostly through the CIP. In addition, USD95.6 million of loans were given. In 1958 and 1959, the CIP accounted for around 80% of <b>economic</b> <b>assistance.</b> By 1960, Diem had accumulated USD216.4 million in reserves. The amount of CIP aid peaked at USD398 million in 1966 and began dropping thereafter, reaching USD233 million by 1973.|$|E

5|$|Stalin {{believed}} that economic integration with the West would allow Eastern Bloc countries to escape Soviet control, {{and that the}} US was trying to buy a pro-US re-alignment of Europe. Stalin therefore prevented Eastern Bloc nations from receiving Marshall Plan aid. The Soviet Union's alternative to the Marshall Plan, which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with central and eastern Europe, {{became known as the}} Molotov Plan (later institutionalized in January 1949 as the Council for Mutual <b>Economic</b> <b>Assistance).</b> Stalin was also fearful of a reconstituted Germany; his vision of a post-war Germany did not include the ability to rearm or pose any kind of threat to the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|In early 1947, France, Britain and the United States unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to reach an}} agreement with the Soviet Union for a plan envisioning an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets. In June 1947, in accordance with the Truman Doctrine, the United States enacted the Marshall Plan, a pledge of <b>economic</b> <b>assistance</b> for all European countries willing to participate, including the Soviet Union. Under the plan, which President Harry S. Truman signed on 3 April 1948, the US government gave to Western European countries over $13 billion (equivalent to $189.39 billion in 2016) to rebuild the economy of Europe. Later, the program {{led to the creation of}} the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{leadership}} {{expected to}} reach these targets with economic aid from the Council for Mutual <b>Economic</b> <b>Assistance</b> (COMECON) and loans from international agencies of the capitalist world. The 4th National Congress {{made it clear that}} agriculture would be socialised; however, during the Second Five-Year Plan the socialisation measures went so badly that Võ Chí Công, a Politburo member and Chairman of the Committee for the Socialist Transformation of Agriculture, claimed {{it would be impossible to}} meet the targets set by the plan by 1980. An estimated 10,000 out of 13,246 socialist cooperatives, established during the plan, had collapsed in the South by 1980. Politburo member Lê Thanh Nghị attacked lower-level cadres for the failure of the socialist agriculture transformation. The collectivisation process led to an abrupt drop in food production in 1977 and 1978, leading the 6th Plenum of the Central Committee to completely overhaul the Party's agricultural policies.|$|E
5|$|The {{closure of}} the border had a {{substantial}} economic and social impact on both halves of Germany. Cross-border transport links were largely severed; 10 main railway lines, 24secondary lines, 23autobahns or national roads, 140regional roads and thousands of smaller roads, paths and waterways were blocked or otherwise interrupted. The tightest level of closure came in 1966, by which time only six railway lines, three autobahns, one regional road and two waterways were left open. When {{relations between the two}} states eased in the 1970s, the GDR agreed to open more crossing points in exchange for <b>economic</b> <b>assistance.</b> Telephone and mail communications operated throughout the Cold War, although packages and letters were routinely opened and telephone calls were monitored by the East German secret police.|$|E

5|$|Diệm {{kept the}} control of the nation firmly within the hands of his {{brothers}} and their in-laws, and promotions in the ARVN were given on the basis of religion and loyalty rather than merit. Two unsuccessful attempts had been made to depose Diệm; in 1960, a paratroop revolt was quashed after Diệm stalled negotiations to buy time for loyalists to put down the coup attempt, while a 1962 palace bombing by two air force pilots failed to kill him. South Vietnam's Buddhist majority had long been discontented with Diệm's strong favoritism towards Catholics. Public servants and army officers had long been promoted on the basis of religious preference, and government contracts, US <b>economic</b> <b>assistance,</b> business favors and tax concessions were preferentially given to Catholics. The Roman Catholic Church was the largest landowner in the country, and its holdings were exempt from land reform. In the countryside, Catholics were de facto exempt from performing corvée labour. Discontent with Diệm and Nhu exploded into mass protest during the summer of 1963 when nine Buddhists died at the hand of Diệm's army and police on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha.|$|E
