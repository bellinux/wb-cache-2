25|$|The timbre or {{tone quality}} of the guitalin can be {{described}} as a combination between a banjo and a mandolin, while the name of the instrument is derived from the combination of the names of the guitar and mandolin. The shape of the body of the instrument is an elongated trapezoid about the length of a standard <b>guitar</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Rock Band Wooden Stratocaster Replica was {{released}} {{at the time}} of the game's release and is basically, a full-size actual wooden <b>guitar</b> <b>body</b> with all of the tuning keys, bridge, metal parts and fittings of the actual guitar left intact; but instead of strings, it has Basic 5-button premium buttons built into the neck. Since there are only 5 buttons and no strings, this one is for Basic game play only. [...] The difference from the other Basic premium controllers is that it is the actual size and weight of a real guitar. [...] It was made available in sunburst and candy apple red colors.|$|E
2500|$|Paul was {{dissatisfied}} with acoustic-electric guitars and began experimenting {{at his apartment}} in Queens, New York with a few designs of his own. Famously, he created several versions of [...] "The Log", which was a length of common 4x4 lumber with a bridge, neck, strings, and pickup attached. For the sake of appearance, he attached the body of an Epiphone hollow-body guitar sawn lengthwise with The Log in the middle. This solved his two main problems: feedback, as the acoustic body no longer resonated with the amplified sound, and sustain, as {{the energy of the}} strings was not dissipated in generating sound through the <b>guitar</b> <b>body.</b> These instruments were constantly being improved and modified over the years, and Paul continued to use them in his recordings long after the development of his eponymous Gibson model.|$|E

2500|$|Some of {{the best}} known guitars made by Schecter are the 'C Series' in various {{configurations}} such as the [...] "Hellraiser" [...] and [...] "Blackjack" [...] models, and the 'S Series', which included the [...] "S-1 Elite" [...] (double cut) guitars, which held some visual similarity to Gibson's Les Paul Double Cut and double cut Melody Maker — and the [...] "S-1" [...] (a less fancy version of the S-1 Elite). The 'Elite' versions of Schecter's mass-produced instruments often include an arched top, abalone binding, a bound fretboard and a bound headstock with a headstock finish matched with that of the <b>guitar</b> <b>body.</b> Despite all the visually impressive dressing these instruments remained quite affordable and the quality standard did not suffer. Pickups on many of the mass-produced Schecter models are almost always 'Duncan Designed' humbuckers (double coil pickups based on Seymour Duncan's pickup specifications), usually with a 'push-pull' coil splitter control that allows the full humbucker pickup sound to be 'split' into the sharper tone characteristic of single coil pickups.|$|E

50|$|With most solid-body guitars, the {{electronics}} are accessed, repaired, or replaced by removing either the pick guard or an access {{panel on the}} back of the <b>guitar’s</b> <b>body.</b> In a semi-acoustic guitar, where there is no solid body to create a chamber to house {{the electronics}}, these components are pushed or pulled through the lower f-hole of the <b>guitar’s</b> <b>body.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The main {{difference}} is that, {{while much of}} the mechanism of the synchronized tremolo including the springs is accessed by removing a rectangular plate {{in the back of the}} <b>guitar</b> <b>body,</b> and is mounted on the <b>guitar</b> <b>body</b> in a routed bay extending behind the pickups, the entire mechanism of the floating tremolo is mounted on a roughly triangular chromed plate in the front of the <b>guitar</b> <b>body,</b> on the opposite side of the bridge to the pickups. The string tension is balanced against a single short helical spring, in compression rather than tension, mounted on the back of the [...] "tremolo mounting plate". The spring is adjustable by turning a screw located towards the center of this plate.|$|E

50|$|Among {{its more}} exotic uses {{is that in}} musical instruments. It {{is used for the}} back and sides of {{acoustic}} <b>guitar</b> <b>bodies,</b> as well as the tops of electric <b>guitar</b> <b>bodies.</b> It is also used in manufacturing the neck piece of ukuleles and 26- and 36-string harps. In the late 90s, it started {{to be used as a}} board for Basque percussion instruments txalaparta. Sapele internal doors (normally a thin veneer of the wood on a cardboard honeycomb inner structure) were very popular in the United Kingdom during the 1980s and 1990s, although uncommon now.|$|R
50|$|The {{difference}} is that a bolt-on neck involves constructing a protruding flange that fits inside a routed pocket in the <b>guitar</b> <b>body.</b> Then the neck is secured inside this pocket using screws that run perpendicular (at right angles) {{to the surface of}} the guitar. In contrast, a bolt-in neck doesn't need to have such a flange inside the <b>guitar</b> <b>body,</b> and screws or bolts run parallel to the surface of guitar, entering the back of the heel.|$|E

50|$|These bridges are bolted {{directly}} to the <b>guitar</b> <b>body.</b> Assuming the bridge is of good quality, it will limit longitudinal string movement, and therefore tuning stability is assured.|$|E
50|$|It is {{generally}} thought that non-tremolo bridges offer better transfer of string vibration into the body. This {{is due to}} direct contact of the bridge to the <b>guitar's</b> <b>body.</b>|$|R

50|$|It is {{also often}} used as {{material}} for electric <b>guitar</b> <b>bodies</b> and, less commonly, for acoustic <b>guitar</b> <b>bodies,</b> known for its bright, cutting tone and sustaining quality. Some Fender Stratocasters and Telecasters are made of ash, {{as an alternative to}} the darker sounding alder. They are also used for making drum shells. Interior joinery is another common use of both European and white ash. Ash veneers are extensively used in office furniture. Ash is not used much outdoors due to the heartwood having a low durability to ground contact, meaning it will typically perish within five years. The Fraxinus japonica species is favored as a material for making baseball bats by Japanese sporting goods manufacturers.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{is to develop a}} pin router {{duplicator}} to accurately produce <b>guitar</b> <b>bodies,</b> necks, and fret boards. The pin router duplicator is designed to speed up the production process for the class Lean Manufacturing (MET 345), offered at Central Washington University. In the class, students learn how to work as a team to improve the way a woodshop is ran. In Lean Manufacturing, <b>guitar</b> <b>bodies,</b> necks, and fret boards are produced by using a CNC router. For this project, the motivation is to increase production by reducing production time. Accuracy and repeatability is also taken into consideration. With the use of the pin router duplicator, more than three <b>guitar</b> <b>bodies</b> will be produced in two hours, which will help with production goals. The methods that are used to arrive at the finished design are by using kinematics, stress, engineering, and static analysis. Free body diagrams, shear, and moment diagrams were used to calculate the reaction forces, {{in order to determine the}} appropriate thickness of the material. The final design that’s going to be used is a 4 bar linkage system. The final design resulted in relief of bottlenecks, which allows for increased production. By using these methods, the necessary components for the 4 bar linkage system are designed. As a result, the production process is faster by using the pin router duplicator compared to the CNC router...|$|R
