Dynamic rigging incidence control has been demonstrated in flight tests and shown to provide effective <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> control. The current work presents flight-test results exploring the range of <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> control {{that can be achieved}} with high-performance parafoil canopies of two different aspect ratios. The low- and medium-aspect-ratio canopies have peak glide ratios of 4. 4 and 4. 9, respectively. By varying the incidence angle in flight, the <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> can be reduced from these peak values to a <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> near two for both canopies. Flight tests investigating the relationship between symmetric brake and incidence control demonstrate that symmetric braking produces effective airspeed control with little effect on <b>glide</b> <b>slope,</b> the incidence angle produces significant effects on both <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> and airspeed, the rapid variation of the incidence angle in flight can lead to significant long period oscillations in both <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> and airspeed, and the coupled effect of the control mechanisms of incidence angle and symmetric brake can produce dramatic changes in <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> in any wind condition.

50|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of ILS localizer and <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> systems, there are some limitations. Localizer systems are sensitive to obstructions in the signal broadcast area, such as large buildings or hangars. <b>Glide</b> <b>slope</b> systems are also limited by the terrain in front of the <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> antennas. If terrain is sloping or uneven, reflections can create an uneven glidepath, causing unwanted needle deflections. Additionally, since the ILS signals are pointed in one direction by the positioning of the arrays, <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> supports only straight-line approaches with a constant angle of descent.

40|$|A piloted {{simulation}} {{experiment was}} conducted using the NASA Ames Research Center Vertical Motion Simulator to evaluate two cockpit display formats designed for manual control on steep instrument approaches for a civil transport tiltrotor aircraft. The first display included a four-cue (pitch, roll, power lever position, and nacelle angle movement prompt) flight director. The second display format provided instantaneous {{flight path angle}} information together with other symbols for terminal area guidance. Pilots evaluated these display formats for an instrument approach task which required a level flight conversion from airplane-mode flight to helicopter-mode flight while decelerating to the nominal approach airspeed.

40|$|The {{optimization}} {{and guidance}} of penetration landing trajectories in a windshear are considered.

In turn, the nominal trajectory includes two parts: the approach part (nominal <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> constant) and the flare part (nominal <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> varying linearly with the horizontal distance). Numerical results show that the optimal trajectory deviates somewhat from the nominal trajectory in the shear region. A guidance scheme is developed to approximate the optimal trajectory.

5000|$|Pilots {{need some}} form {{of control over the}} <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> to land the glider. In powered aircraft, this is done by {{reducing}} engine thrust. In gliders, other methods are used to either reduce the lift generated by the wing, increase the drag of the entire glider, or both. <b>Glide</b> <b>slope</b> is the distance traveled for each unit of height lost. In a steady wings-level <b>glide</b> with no wind, <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> {{is the same as the}} lift/drag ratio (L/D) of the glider, called [...] "L-over-D". Reducing lift from the wings and/or increasing drag will reduce the L/D allowing the glider to descend at a steeper angle with no increase in airspeed. Simply pointing the nose downwards only converts altitude into a higher airspeed with a minimal initial reduction in total energy. Gliders, because of their long low wings, create a high ground effect which can significantly increase the glide angle and make it difficult to bring the glider to Earth in a short distance.|$|R
40|$|General Mitchell International Airport (MKE) {{located in}} Milwaukee, WI, has many {{man-made}} perching sites used by hawks.

The first perching sites addressed at MKE were six lamp posts {{at the base of the}} 128 th Air Refueling Wing of the Wisconsin Air National Guard, which were used daily by red-tailed hawks. In order to mitigate the perching, umbrella skeletons (Daddi Long Legs™ or Bird Spider™) were recommended to be attached to the top of each lamp post. After installation of the skeletons, perching was reduced from daily to none. The effectiveness of the skeletons on the lamp posts led to a consultation with FAA technicians to request the skeletons be placed on top of several pieces of FAA equipment (i. e., <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> towers). During these same meetings, the technicians stated plastic cable ties could be used on the antennae and obstruction lights on the <b>glide</b> <b>slopes</b> as a deterrent for red-tailed hawk perching. It has been commonly mentioned that these devices cannot be installed because of interference with sensitive equipment; therefore, an evaluation was conducted. Cable ties and an umbrella skeleton were attached to one of three <b>glide</b> <b>slopes</b> and a flight check was conducted to determine if these devices might interfere with equipment operation. Anti-perching equipment did not interfere with <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> operation; therefore, an umbrella skeleton and cable ties are scheduled to be placed on one additional <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> at MKE.
