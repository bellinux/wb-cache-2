40|$|Recently, horse {{breeding}} {{has achieved}} greater {{prominence in the}} Brazilian society and now it started to appear {{as a part of}} the Brazilian agribusiness. The state of Minas Gerais stands out as the main producer <b>of</b> <b>equidae</b> in Brazil. The aim of this work was to characterize the breeding <b>of</b> <b>equidae</b> in this State in order to support future researches in this sector. By the evaluation of records from 1990 to 2009 provided by the "Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics" (IBGE) and also 967 interviews with breeders <b>of</b> <b>equidae,</b> it was possible to characterize some important points. It was observed that equidae breeding in this State moves over R$ 1, 500, 000, 000 per year and employs 86, 000 people. The main investments of the properties are made in purchasing saddles, accessories and commercial feeds. The main goal <b>of</b> <b>equidae</b> breeders in Minas Gerais has been the work in rural properties (49. 49 %) complementing many farming activities, especially the work with cows. Although Minas Gerais holds the main herd <b>of</b> <b>equidae</b> in the country, the number of animals has decreased. On the one hand, the equidae breeding sector has demonstrated its social and economic importance in agribusiness; on the other, hand further researches are needed to develop public policies to improve the breeding <b>of</b> <b>equidae</b> in Minas Gerais...|$|R

5000|$|Pliohippus (Greek πλεῖον (pleion, [...] "more") and ἵππος (ippos, [...] "horse")) is an extinct genus <b>of</b> <b>Equidae,</b> the [...] "horse family". Pliohippus {{arose in}} the middle Miocene, around 15 million years ago. It was similar in {{appearance}} to Equus, but had two long extra toes {{on both sides of}} the hoof, externally barely visible as callused stubs. The long and slim limbs of Pliohippus reveal a quick-footed steppe animal.|$|R
25|$|In {{response}} to the changing environment, the then-living species <b>of</b> <b>Equidae</b> also began to change. In the late Eocene, they began developing tougher teeth and becoming slightly larger and leggier, allowing for faster running speeds in open areas, and thus for evading predators in nonwooded areas. About 40 mya, Mesohippus ("middle horse") suddenly developed in {{response to}} strong new selective pressures to adapt, beginning with the species Mesohippus celer and soon followed by Mesohippus westoni.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this study, {{we propose}} a method based on life tables {{currently}} used in population dynamics and ecology {{to compare the}} mortality curves <b>of</b> <b>Equidae</b> from anthropic and carnivore fossil assemblages with those from modern populations. The combined analysis of frequency (fx) with various ecological parameters such as mortality rate (qx), survival rate (lx), fecundity rate (mx), and killing factor (kx), established for each age class, allows us to characterize the stability of fossil populations. These ecological parameters, developed in demography, correspond to many curves and constitute a complementary approach to interpret the two main mortality models, attritional and catastrophic, often evoked in zooarchaeology. The age structures of fossil horses from the anthropic sites of Bau de l'Aubesier (Vaucluse, France) and Combe-Grenal (Dordogne, France) and the hyena den of Fouvent (Haute-Saoˆ ne, France) are compared to typical catastrophic modern populations <b>of</b> <b>Equidae</b> from the National Park of Akagera (Rwanda). We also used data collected by the Bureau of Land Management for present day feral horses from Pryor Mountain (Montana, USA) which constitutes a reliable referential of a stable living population. The characterization of age structures in those different contexts is discussed {{as well as the}} impact of Neanderthals and hyenas on fossil assemblages...|$|R
40|$|The major {{histocompatibility}} complex genes coding for antigen binding and presenting molecules are the most polymorphic genes in the vertebrate genome. We studied the DRA and DQA gene polymorphism <b>of</b> the family <b>Equidae.</b> In addition to 11 previously reported DRA and 24 DQA alleles, six new DRA sequences and 13 new DQA alleles were identified in the genus Equus. Phylogenetic analysis of both DRA and DQA sequences provided evidence for trans-species polymorphism in the family Equidae. The phylogenetic trees differed from species relationships defined by standard taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>Equidae</b> and from trees based on mitochondrial or neutral gene sequence data. Analysis of selection showed differences between the less variable DRA and more variable DQA genes. DRA alleles were more often shared by more species. The DQA sequences analysed showed strong amongst-species positive selection; the selected amino acid positions mostly corresponded to selected positions in rodent and human DQA genes.

25|$|For a span {{of about}} 20 million years, Eohippus thrived with few {{significant}} evolutionary changes. The most significant change was in the teeth, which began to adapt to its changing diet, as these early Equidae shifted from a mixed diet of fruits and foliage to one focused increasingly on browsing foods. During the Eocene, an Eohippus species (most likely Eohippus angustidens) branched out into various new types <b>of</b> <b>Equidae.</b> Thousands <b>of</b> complete, fossilized skeletons of these animals {{have been found in}} the Eocene layers of North American strata, mainly in the Wind River basin in Wyoming.

40|$|AbstractAfrican horse {{sickness}} virus (AHSV) is an arthropod-borne pathogen that infects {{all species}} <b>of</b> <b>equidae</b> and causes high mortality in horses. Previously, a recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus expressing the protein VP 2 of AHSV serotype 4 {{was shown to}} induce virus neutralising antibodies in horses and protected interferon alpha receptor gene knock-out mice (IFNAR −/−) against virulent AHSV challenge. This study builds on the previous work, examining the protective efficacy of MVA-VP 2 vaccination in the natural host of AHSV infection. A study group of 4 horses was vaccinated twice with a recombinant MVA virus expressing the major capsid protein (VP 2) of AHSV serotype 9. Vaccinated animals and a control group of unvaccinated horses were then challenged with a virulent strain of AHSV- 9. The vaccinated animals were completely protected against clinical disease and also against viraemia as measured by standard end-point dilution assays. In contrast, all control horses presented viraemia after challenge and succumbed to the infection. These results demonstrate the potential of recombinant MVA viruses expressing the outer capsid VP 2 of AHSV as a protective vaccine against AHSV infection in the field...|$|R

Only pure-bred Icelandic horses, whose ancestry {{can be traced back}} to Iceland entirely, may be registered into WorldFengur. The WorldFengur project is a joint effort by the FAIC (Farmers Association of Iceland) and FEIF (International Federation of Icelandic Horse Associations) to construct an official and central database on horses of Icelandic origin located all over the world. It is used in this capacity in 19 countries so far; the number of data stored in the WorldFengur database has increased continuously. The database itself has developed tremendously since it was established in 2001; it includes information on horses’ pedigrees and offspring, as well as results of breeding assessments and sports competitions, owners, breeders, breeding prediction values (BLUP), colours, microchip numbers, health records, DNA profiles for checking ancestries and much more.
