5|$|Some {{animals can}} {{navigate}} using celestial cues {{such as the}} position of the sun. Since the sun moves in the sky, navigation by this means also requires an <b>internal</b> <b>clock.</b> Many animals depend on such a clock to maintain their circadian rhythm. Animals that use sun compass orientation are fish, birds, sea-turtles, butterflies, bees, sandhoppers, reptiles, and ants.|$|E
5|$|Gold and Silver {{were first}} {{publicly}} showcased at the 1997 Nintendo SpaceWorld Expo in Japan, becoming {{the most popular}} exhibit at the program. Unlike the previous game in the series, Pokémon Yellow, the new titles were announced {{to be more than}} a small upgrade to Pokémon Red and Blue. Instead, they would feature a new storyline, a new world, and new species of Pokémon. Gold and Silver were designed for the Game Boy Color, allowing them full color support and more detailed sprites. Other additions that were shown included Pokémon breeding, held items, an in-game gadget known as the PokéGear, a real-time <b>internal</b> <b>clock,</b> and backward compatibility with the previous games in the series.|$|E
5|$|When sandhoppers (such as Talitrus saltator) {{are taken}} up a beach, they easily {{find their way}} {{back down to the}} sea. It has been shown that this is not simply by moving {{downhill}} or towards the sight or sound of the sea. A group of sandhoppers were acclimatised to a day/night cycle under artificial lighting, whose timing was gradually changed until it was 12 hours out of phase with the natural cycle. Then, the sandhoppers were placed on the beach in natural sunlight. They moved away from the sea, up the beach. The experiment implied that the sandhoppers use the sun and their <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> to determine their heading, and that they had learnt the actual direction down to the sea on their particular beach.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "zeitgeber" [...] ( [...] , {{literally}} [...] "time giver", i.e., [...] "synchronizer") {{was first}} used by Jürgen Aschoff, {{one of the founders}} of the field of chronobiology. His work demonstrated the existence of endogenous (<b>internal)</b> biological <b>clocks,</b> which synchronize biological rhythms. In addition, he found that certain exogenous (external) cues, which he called zeitgebers, influence the timing of these <b>internal</b> <b>clocks.</b>|$|R
25|$|Note {{that because}} {{internal}} operations are at 1/2 the clock rate, DDR2-400 memory (<b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> rate 100MHz) has somewhat higher latency than DDR-400 (<b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> rate 200MHz).|$|E
25|$|Memory {{manufacturers}} {{stated that}} it was impractical to mass-produce DDR1 memory with effective transfer rates in excess of 400MHz (i.e. 400 MT/s and 200MHz external clock) due to internal speed limitations. DDR2 picks up where DDR1 leaves off, utilizing <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> rates similar to DDR1, but is available at effective transfer rates of 400MHz and higher. DDR3 advances extended the ability to preserve <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> rates while providing higher effective transfer rates by again doubling the prefetch depth.|$|E

50|$|A {{general rule}} is that DCE devices provide the <b>clock</b> signal (<b>internal</b> <b>clocking)</b> and the DTE device synchronizes on the {{provided}} clock (external clocking). D-sub connectors follow another rule for pin assignment.|$|R
50|$|System designs usually {{encompass}} {{more than}} several clock domains with signals traversing separate domains. On-board clock oscillators and global clock lines usually mitigate these issues, but sometimes these resources {{may be limited}} or not fulfill all design requirements. <b>Internal</b> <b>clocks</b> should be implemented within FPGA devices since clock line and clock buffers connections are limited between FPGAs. <b>Internal</b> <b>clocked</b> designs which are partitioned across multiple FPGAs should replicate the clock generator within the FPGA, ensuring a low clock skew between inter-FPGA signals. In addition, any gated clock logic should be transformed to clock enables to reduce skew while operating at high clock frequencies.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Internal</b> <b>clocks</b> are {{affected}} by light [...] Biological clocks are regulated by our light exposure [...] When we expose ourselves to light at night, our <b>internal</b> <b>clocks</b> reset and sleepiness is suppressed [...] In an experiment that evaluated different colors affect on <b>internal</b> <b>clocks</b> at night, blue light was found to set back the clocks the most, {{twice as much as}} green light. According to this article, blue light {{has been found to be}} the most detrimental to our sleep schedule and <b>internal</b> <b>clocks</b> when exposed to at night. The release of melatonin, the hormone that triggers sleepiness, can be inhibited by even the use of computer of phone screens, which in turn can make it hard to fall asleep right away. Overall, absorbing light during the day, as opposed to night, may make a difference in falling and staying asleep. Through experimentation, red light was found to provide no effect in sleep. Blue light, on the other hand, was found to prevent or put off sleepiness at night. But, it was found that people who were exposed to natural blue light, derived from the sun and sky, during the day, had a better time sleeping at night and suffered less from depression [...] Artificial light from light bulbs or screens can change or mess up our biological clocks. These lights can channel our body into thinking it is morning when in reality we have not yet gone to bed.|$|R

40|$|A Global Positioning System Synchronized Active Light Autonomous Docking System (GPSSALADS) for {{automatically}} docking a chase {{vehicle with}} a target vehicle comprises {{at least one}} active light emitting target which is operatively attached to the target vehicle. The target includes a three-dimensional array of concomitantly flashing lights which flash at a controlled common frequency. The GPSSALADS further comprises a visual tracking sensor operatively attached to the chase vehicle for detecting and tracking the target vehicle. Its performance is synchronized with the flash frequency of the lights by a synchronization means which is comprised of first and second <b>internal</b> <b>clocks</b> operatively connected to the active light target and visual tracking sensor, respectively, for providing timing control signals thereto, respectively. The synchronization means further includes first and second Global Positioning System receivers operatively connected to {{the first and second}} <b>internal</b> <b>clocks,</b> respectively, for repeatedly providing simultaneous synchronization pulses to the <b>internal</b> <b>clocks,</b> respectively. In addition, the GPSSALADS includes a docking process controller means which is operatively attached to the chase vehicle and is responsive to the visual tracking sensor for producing commands for the guidance and propulsion system of the chase vehicle...|$|R
50|$|As LIN Slave nodes {{should be}} as cheap as possible, they may {{generate}} their <b>internal</b> <b>clocks</b> by using RC oscillators instead of crystal oscillators (quartz or a ceramic).To ensure the baud rate-stability within one LIN frame, the SYNC field within the header is used.|$|R
50|$|For two {{connected}} exchanges in {{a communications}} network, a double-ended synchronization (also called double-ended control) is a synchronization control scheme {{in which the}} phase error signals used to control the clock at one telephone exchange are derived by comparison with the phase of the incoming digital signal and the phase of the <b>internal</b> <b>clocks</b> at both exchanges.|$|R
25|$|Bees have an <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> {{with three}} {{different}} synchronization or timekeeping mechanisms. If a bee knows the direction to a feeding place found during a morning excursion, it can also find the same location, {{as well as the}} precise time at which this source provides food, in the afternoon, based on the position of the sun.|$|E
25|$|The {{game has}} its own <b>internal</b> <b>clock,</b> with thirty-six minutes of real time {{corresponding}} to one in-game day. The sun and moon move visibly across the sky with the hours, with objects casting shadows that move accordingly, and the moon undergoes phases. A second moon, always rising and setting opposite the sun, is described {{as the source of}} magic energy, and players recharge mana faster while it is in the sky.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} circadian {{clock is}} profoundly influenced {{by changes in}} light, since these are its main clues about what time it is. Exposure to even small amounts of light during the night can suppress melatonin secretion, increase body temperature, and increase cognitive ability. Short pulses of light, {{at the right moment}} in the circadian cycle, can significantly 'reset' the <b>internal</b> <b>clock.</b> Blue light, in particular, exerts the strongest effect, leading to concerns that electronic media use before bed may interfere with sleep.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike blue light, {{other forms}} of light (e.g. yellow, green) do not affect sleep the same way [...] An {{experiment}} in this article [...] was performed to test this idea using three variables, blue light, yellow light, and darkness. Each group was exposed to light {{or in the case}} of the control group, darkness, for before bed. The results concluded that blue light inhibited signs of sleepiness while the control group showed expected signs of tiredness and the yellow light showed no significant effect on sleep. In another experiment that evaluated different colors affect on <b>internal</b> <b>clocks</b> at night, blue light was found to set back the clocks the most, twice as much as green light.

25|$|Before DBT begins phosphorylating PER, a {{different}} protein called NEMO/NLK kinase begins phosphorylating PER at its per-short domain. This phosphorylation stimulates DBT to begin phosphorylating PER at multiple nearby sites. In total, {{there are about}} 25-30 phosphorylation sites on PER. The phosphorylated PER binds to the F-box protein SLIMB, and it is then targeted for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Therefore, the phosphorylation of PER by DBT leads to a decrease in PER abundance, which is a necessary step in {{the function of the}} organism's <b>internal</b> <b>clock.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sony {{confirmed}} {{that there was}} an error and stated that it was narrowing down the issue and were continuing to work to restore service. By March 2 (UTC), 2010, owners of original PS3 models could connect to PSN successfully and the clock no longer showed December 31, 1999. Sony stated that the affected models incorrectly identified 2010 as a leap year, because of a bug in the BCD method of storing the date. However, for some users, the hardware's operating system clock (mainly updated from the internet and not associated with the <b>internal</b> <b>clock)</b> needed to be updated manually or by re-syncing it via the internet.|$|E
25|$|The P5 was {{followed}} by the P54C (80502), also known as Pentium-S; there were versions specified to operate at 75, 90, or 100MHz using a 3.3 volt power supply. This was the first Pentium processor to operate at 3.3 volts, reducing energy consumption. It employed an <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> multiplier to let the internal circuitry work at a higher frequency than the external address and data buses, as it is more complicated and cumbersome to increase the external frequency, due to physical constraints. It also allowed two-way multiprocessing and had an integrated local APIC as well as new power management features. It contained 3.3 million transistors and measured 163mm2. It was fabricated in a BiCMOS process which has been described as both 0.5µm and 0.6 µm due to differing definitions.|$|E

Two different encodings are used: a public encoding that enables lower resolution navigation, and an encrypted encoding used by the U.S. military.|$|R
50|$|When Siffre {{emerged on}} September 14, {{he thought it}} was August 20. His mind had lost track of time, but, oddly enough, his body had not. While in the cave, Siffre telephoned his {{research}} assistants every time he woke up, ate, and went to sleep. As it turns out, he’d unintentionally kept regular cycles of sleeping and waking. An average day for Siffre lasted a little more than 24 hours. Humans beings, Siffre discovered, have <b>internal</b> <b>clocks.</b>|$|R
500|$|Wrestlers {{return to}} full health after each match, {{and the game}} keeps track {{of the time of}} {{victories}} and records with the PlayStation 2 <b>internal</b> <b>clock.</b> A memory card can be used to save progress, battle snapshots, and match videos; the latter of which can either be ten-second long instant replays or up to three entire [...] "Best Bout" [...] matches.

500|$|The game {{features}} an artificial life system known as [...] "A-Life", which involves entities called Nightopians and {{keeps track of}} their moods. It is possible to have them mate with other Nightopians, which will result in creating hybrids known as [...] "Superpians". The more the game is played, the more inhabitants appear, and environmental {{features an}}d aesthetics will consequently change. The A-Life system features an evolving music engine, allowing tempo, pitch, and melody to alter depending {{on the state of}} Nightopians within the level. The feature runs from the Sega Saturn's <b>internal</b> <b>clock,</b> which will also alter features in the A-Life system depending on the time.|$|E
500|$|Okada's {{goal with}} Jewel Summoner {{was to create}} an {{original}} game [...] "that {{goes back to the}} basics of gaming". [...] At the Akihabara Entertainment Festival in 2005, Okada explained that the Japanese gaming industry was full of game series and he was interested in developing new ideas. [...] Shortly after Gaia was formed, the new studio learned that Sony was interested in finding developers for its upcoming handheld game console, the PlayStation Portable. [...] Gaia developed Jewel Summoner exclusively for the PSP, including visuals tailored to its screen and a creature development system that would utilize the console's <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> to continually train monsters, even when the unit was not in use.|$|E
5000|$|The {{implication}} of independent <b>internal</b> <b>clocks</b> may {{explain some of}} the symptoms of jet lag. People who travel across several time zones can, within a few days, adapt their sleep-wake cycles with light from the environment. However, their skeletal muscles, liver, lungs and other organs will adapt at different rates. This internal biological de-synchronisation is exacerbated as the body is not in sync with the environment—a [...] "double desynchronisation", which has implications for health and mood.|$|R
50|$|Before {{turning to}} {{clinical}} research, Terman’s laboratory work {{focused on the}} effects of light-dark exposure and timing of food ingestion on circadian rhythm organization in animals. The hypothalamic <b>internal</b> “master” <b>clock</b> in the suprachiasmatic nuclei had recently been discovered, with a primary function of programming daily cycles of physiology and behavior {{even in the absence of}} day-night cues. In animals lacking the clock nuclei, they showed that circadian rhythms of visual sensitivity and anticipatory behavior for scheduled meals persisted, even though unrestricted feeding and drinking behavior became arrhythmic. This work contributed to the conception of “peripheral” <b>internal</b> <b>clocks</b> (e.g., in the retina and liver) that operate in a coordinated multiple-clock system. With Swiss colleagues Charlotte Remé and Anna Wirz-Justice, he published the 1991 empirical and theoretical synthesis, The Visual Input Stage of the Circadian Timing System.|$|R
30|$|CelFSync is {{applicable}} to both {{time division duplex}} (TDD) and frequency division duplex (FDD). Nodes adjust their <b>internal</b> <b>clocks</b> based on received sync words; whether the uplink and downlink sync words are transmitted on different frequency bands or not is irrelevant. The discussion in this paper targets half-duplex transmission, where nodes cannot receive and transmit at the same time, applicable to TDD and half-duplex FDD. Full-duplex FDD benefits CelFSync, since nodes can transmit and receive simultaneously, which eliminates deafness due to missed sync words whilst transmitting.|$|R
