It is found that the charge transport in the channel is not limited by the contact electrode in staggered OFETs, whereas coplanar OFETs show strongly contact-limited behavior. This dissimilarity originates from the continuity (staggered) or discontinuity (coplanar) of the carrier concentration at the channel ends, which is directly connected to the channel potential profile. The calculated current-voltage curves also support these arguments as the current in coplanar OFETs follows the contact-limited transistor model...|$|R

And the photon-gated spin-FET shows strong light power dependence and reproducible enhancement of resistance under light illumination, indicting well-defined conductivity cycling features.

" The CNT {{is expected to be}} a next-generation material because it has a lot of useful characters, e. g., it can have both metallic and semiconducting characteristics. Thread is flexible and an everyday material. In our study, we succeeded in developing the CNTCT easily by dipping thread in CNT dispersion like dyeing. Here, we also developed and demonstrated a novel <b>type</b> of <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistor</b> (FET), i. e., the thread transistor. To do this, we prepared a metallic (M) and a semiconducting (S) CNTCT. The S-CNTCT was coated with a non-conductive paint as an insulating layer for simplicity. To construct the thread transistor, we tensed the S-CNTCT that plays the role of a channel for the FET and tied the M-CNTCT around the S-CNTCT as a gate electrode. The source and drain electrodes can also be materialized by tying the M-CNTCTs. As a result of measurement, a drain-to-source current could be measured on the order of micro-amperes. Moreover, the current could be controlled by the gate voltage. 1...|$|R

The proposed device is composed of two gated lateral BJT components, one of which had a silicide layer while the other was without the layer. The two components were operated under the metal-oxide semiconductor <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistor</b> (MOSFET) -BJT hybrid mode, which can be controlled by emitter voltage and base current.
