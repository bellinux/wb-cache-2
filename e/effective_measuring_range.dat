40|$|Abstract: Based on a {{commercial}} laser interferometrically controlled long-range nanopositioning unit a traceable metrological STM {{with a range of}} 25 mm ⋅ 25 mm ⋅ 5 mm and a resolution up to 0. 1 nm has been designed, set-up and tested. Design objectives of the custom made STM probing system were low noise and high thermal and mechanical stability to enable for time consuming large area scans. As the nanopositioning stage is capable of traceable position measurement the probing system is used in compensation method, i. e. minimizing the <b>effective</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>range</b> of the sensor so that the length measured untraceably by the sensor is negligible compared to the lengths measured traceably by the interferometers...|$|E
40|$|So far, the double-magnetic {{induction}} (DMI) {{method has}} been successfully applied to record eye movements from head-restrained humans, monkeys and cats. An advantage of the DMI method, compared to the more widely used scleral search coil technique, {{is the absence of}} vulnerable lead wires on the eye. A disadvantage, however, is that the relationship between the eye-in-head orientation and the secondary induction signal is highly non-linear and non-monotonic. This limits the <b>effective</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>range</b> to maximum eye orientations of about +/- 30 degrees. Here, we analyze and test two extensions required to record the full eye-head orienting range, well exceeding 90 degrees from straight-ahead in all directions. (1) The use of mutually perpendicular magnetic fields allows for the disambiguation of the non-monotonic signal from the ring. (2) The application of an artificial neural network for offline calibration of the signals. The theoretical predictions are tested for horizontal rotations with a gimbal system. Our results show that the method is a promising alternative to the search coil technique...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the relationship between the}} eggshells' crack and detecting points by means of acoustics, and then found out the effective detecting range. Based on those data, it provided the number of the examining points and the way of their arrangements, which could make an effective application to the develop on automatic eggshells' detecting system. The experiment includes two parts. Firstly, knocking a 5 mm crack on each of 14 perfect eggshells at 14 different locations. It obtained the differences of amplitude attenuation between the eggshell before and after knocking. From the results, it showed that the waveform converged and disappeared very fast when knocking at or around the crack. However, the behavior was not the same as previous phenomenon when knocking at the perfect part. Secondly, it knocked on eggshells by using sound-gathering tube to find out and analyze the effective measuring rage. The results showed that the effective range is about 20 to 30 mm. Therefore, the conservative estimate was suggested to choose 20 mm as an <b>effective</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>range.</b> According to those fundamental data, it was recommended that the best number of detecting points was 12 and distance between each two points was less than 40 mm. 本研究係以聲波方式探討蛋殼裂痕的位置與檢測點之關係，並找出有效的檢測範圍，以提供檢測點數目及規劃檢測器排列之基礎資料，使應用於蛋殼裂痕檢測自動化系統之開發。本試驗主要分為兩個部分，第一部份將 14 顆完整蛋分別在 14 個不同位置敲出約 5 mm之裂痕，使得到同一顆蛋在相同位置有裂痕（敲裂後）與沒有裂痕（敲裂前）的音波之振幅衰減情況的差異。由實驗可知敲擊在裂痕上或其鄰近處的衝擊波迅速收斂而消失，而完整處則否。第二部份以集音管敲擊裂痕蛋並分析其有效測試範圍，由實驗得知有效的檢測距離約為 20 ~ 30 mm，故保守有效檢測半徑以 20 mm內為佳。依據此基礎資料，本研究建議蛋殼裂痕之檢測點數目為 12 ，且各點之間的距離應小於 40 mm...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} compare the performances of four different instruments for measuring suspended cohesive sediment concentrations (SSCs). Among these instruments, two were different models of optical backscatter sensor (i. e., OBS 3 + and OBS 5 +), one was an acoustic Doppler velocimeter (MicroADV), and the last was a laser infrared optical sensor developed at Hohai University, China (HHU-LIOS). Sediments collected from the Yangtze River Estuary and a commercially available kaolinite were selected to check the responses of these four instruments. They were placed in an aqueous solution, and the SSCs were changed within a range from about 10 mg/L to 30 g/L to demonstrate the <b>effective</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>ranges</b> for each instrument. For the kaolinite suspension, {{the results showed that}} the HHU-LIOS has a much larger linear response range (0. 1 to 13 g/L) when compared with other devices (the MicroADV: 0. 1 to 1. 35 g/L; the OBS 3 +: 0. 1 to 5 g/L; and the OBS 5 +: 0. 1 to 1 g/L). For the sediment sample from the Yangtze River Estuary, the results showed that the HHU-LIOS has a much wider usable range (from 0. 1 to 25 g/L), compared with those for the others. It also showed that a combination of using a HHU-LIOS for the quadratic increasing range up to 25 g/L and the OBS 5 + for the clear decreasing output are able to measure the SSCs of the estuarine mud up to 50 g/L...|$|R
40|$|X-ray Talbot-Lau {{interferometer}} {{has been}} used widely to conduct phase contrast imaging with a conventional low-brilliance x-ray source. Typically, in this technique, background correction has to be performed {{in order to obtain}} the pure signal of the sample under inspection. In this study, we reported on a research on the background correction strategies within this technique, especially we introduced a new phase unwrapping solution for one conventional background correction method, the key point of this new solution is changing the initial phase of each pixel by a cyclic shift operation on the raw images collected in phase stepping scan. Experimental result and numerical analysis showed that the new phase unwrapping algorithm could successfully subtract contribution of the system's background without error. Moreover, a potential advantage of this phase unwrapping strategy is that its <b>effective</b> phase <b>measuring</b> <b>range</b> could be tuned flexibly in some degree for example to be (-pi+ 3, pi+ 3], thus it would find usage in certain case because <b>measuring</b> <b>range</b> of the currently widely used background correction method is fixed to be (-pi, pi].

40|$|Summary: Investigations {{have been}} made up. on the {{distribution}} of lipoprotein(a) concentrations in cord and capil-lary blood from newborns and in serum from in-patient children and adults. Full-tenn neonates (n = 123), children aged l month to 16 years (n = 331) and adults aged between 17 and 88 years (n = 252) of age were included in the study. Lipoprotein(a) was determined using an immunoluminometric assay and a single lot of reagents. The assay had an <b>effective</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>ränge</b> of 1 — 800 mg/ 1. Lipoprotein(a) could be measured either in cord or capillary blood in the majority of cases. Problems arose in isolated cases, in each of which there was a large concentration difference in lipoprotein(a) between mother and child. The correlation data was: r = 0. 897, n = 37, log (capillary blood) = 0. 874 log (cord blood) + 0. 165. The median lipoprotein(ä) concentrations in cord and capillary blood were 13. 9 and 10. 2 mg/ 1 respectively. Mediän lipoprotein(ä) concentrations increased from birth up until the 6 th decade (159 mg/ 1), decreasing to 95 mg/ 1 düring the 9 th decade of life. In mature newborns, the median lipoprotein(a) concentrations correlated with ges-tational age. The distribution of Hpoprotein(a) concentrations in serum is skewed throughout life, the ratio mean/median being 2. 07 at birth, 2. 71 in children and 2. 72 in adults. The percentage of children with lipoprotein(a) concentration...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method for}} {{two-dimensional}} fluorescence lifetime imaging is presented. The technique is demonstrated on averaged planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) signals recorded in a flame. Although demonstrated on averaged images, the concept applies equally well to single-shot images. Formaldehyde was probed through pico-second excitation at 355 nm {{in a rich}} methane/oxygen flame (Phi = 2. 6). Images were recorded with a dual ICCD camera detection setup with different gate characteristics of the two cameras. The recorded images were analyzed using simulated values of LIF signal detection to generate two-dimensional images of <b>effective</b> lifetimes. <b>Measured</b> lifetimes <b>range</b> from roughly 1 to 4. 5 ns. The lifetime image data were used for quenching correction of the LIF images, which, after correction, showed better qualitative agreement compared to a formaldehyde concentration profile simulated with the GRI 3. 0 mechanism.

40|$|Using item {{response}} theory (IRT), {{we examined}} the Rheumatoid Arthritis Self-efficacy scale (RASE) collected from a People with Arthritis Can Exercise RCT (346 participants) and 2 subscales of the Arthritis Self-efficacy scale (ASE) collected from an Active Living Every Day (ALED) RCT (354 participants) to determine which one better identifies low arthritis self-efficacy in community-based adults with arthritis. The item parameters were estimated in Multilog using the graded response model. The 2 ASE subscales are adequately explained by one factor. There was evidence for 2 locally dependent item pairs; two items from these pairs were removed when we reran the model.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{treatment}} of COPD {{has become increasingly}} <b>effective.</b> <b>Measures</b> that <b>range</b> from behavioral changes, reduction in exposure to risk factors, education about the disease and its course, rehabilitation, oxygen therapy, management of comorbidities, and surgical and pharmacological treatments to end-of-life care allow health professionals to provide a personalized and effective therapy. The pharmacological {{treatment of}} COPD {{is one of the}} cornerstones of COPD management, and there have been many advances in this area in recent years. Given the greater availability of drugs and therapeutic combinations, it has become increasingly challenging to know the indications for, limitations of, and potential risks and benefits of each treatment modality. In order to critically evaluate recent evidence and systematize the major questions regarding the pharmacological treatment of COPD, 24 specialists from all over Brazil gathered to develop the present recommendations. A visual guide was developed for the classification and treatment of COPD, both of which were adapted to fit the situation in Brazil. Ten questions were {{selected on the basis of}} their relevance in clinical practice. They address the classification, definitions, treatment, and evidence available for each drug or drug combination. Each question was answered by two specialists, and then the answers were consolidated in two phases: review and consensus by all participants. The questions answered are practical questions and help select from among the many options the best treatment for each patient and his/her peculiarities...|$|R
