40|$|On November 18, 2012, ASEAN {{countries}} signed ASEAN Human Rights <b>Declaration.</b> Since structured as a draft, this <b>declaration</b> {{has drawn}} controversy.

The Opponents considered that the <b>declaration</b> actually provide opportunities for ASEAN countries to commit human rights violations. Although both arguments are right, {{there is one thing that}} need to be underlined that the ten ASEAN countries have already signed the ASEAN Human Rights <b>Declaration.</b> This paper will examine the legalization of the ASEAN Human Rights <b>Declaration.</b> By examining its three dimensions -obligation, precision and delegation- ASEAN Human Rights <b>Declaration</b> is categorized as a soft legalization. The obligation of ASEAN Human Rights <b>Declaration</b> is low because it has no binding force. All ASEAN countries do not have obligation to implement the articles of the <b>declaration.</b> The precision of the <b>declaration</b> is also low because the words used in the <b>declaration</b> are ambiguous. It provides opportunities for the members of ASEAN countries to interpret them in different ways. Finally, the delegation of the <b>declaration</b> is also low because there is no third party that has authority to monitor the states 2 ̆ 7 compliance to the <b>declaration</b> and resolve conflicts that arise in case of human rights violations...|$|R

5|$|In August 1990, an {{insurgency}} {{known as the}} Log Revolution took place in Croatia. It centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around the city of Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, and Banovina regions, and settlements in eastern Croatia with significant Serb populations. These areas were subsequently declared to be the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK). After the RSK declared its intention to join Serbia, the Government of Croatia declared the RSK a rebel organization. By March 1991, the conflict had escalated, resulting in the Croatian War of Independence. In June 1991, Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated.

5|$|In Tan Eng Hong, the Court of Appeal {{stated that}} the same test for {{standing}} applies to both <b>declarations</b> and prerogative orders, and read the statements from Chan Hiang Leng Colin quoted above as an implicit acceptance that an applicant must demonstrate the violation of a right personal {{to him or her}} to have standing.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to prerogative orders, the equitable remedy of a declaration {{can be employed}} to control an excess of legal authority. A declaration is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court.

Only the High Court may grant <b>declarations</b> in judicial review cases; although the Subordinate Courts are generally empowered by the Subordinate Courts Act to grant <b>declarations,</b> a District Court exercises no judicial review jurisdiction over acts or decisions of persons or authorities, and a Magistrate's Court cannot deal with any action {{in which there is}} no claim for any sum of money.|$|E
