25|$|Once a <b>displaced</b> <b>person</b> {{is granted}} refugee status they enjoy certain rights as agreed in the 1951 Refugee convention. Not all {{countries}} have signed and ratified this convention and some countries {{do not have}} a legal procedure for dealing with asylum seekers.|$|E
25|$|A refugee, {{generally}} speaking, is a <b>displaced</b> <b>person</b> who {{has been}} forced to cross national boundaries and who cannot return home safely (for more detail see legal definition). Such a person may be called an asylum seeker until granted refugee status by the contracting state or the UNHCR if they formally make a claim for asylum.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} be given refugee status the person must have applied for asylum. This person was then, whilst waiting for a decision, an asylum seeker. However, a <b>displaced</b> <b>person</b> who would legally be {{entitled}} to refugee status may never apply for asylum, {{or may not be}} allowed to apply in the country they fled to and thus not be an asylum seeker.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} be given refugee status a <b>displaced</b> <b>person</b> {{has to go through}} a Refugee Status Determination (RSD) process, which is {{conducted}} by the government of the country of asylum or the UNHCR, and based on international, regional or national law.

25|$|The term refugee {{is often}} used in {{different}} contexts: in everyday usage it refers to a forcibly <b>displaced</b> <b>person</b> who has fled their country of origin; in a more specific context it refers to such a person who was, on top of that, granted refugee status in the country the person fled to. Even more exclusive is the Convention refugee status which is given only to persons who fall within the refugee definition of the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. {{government}} {{estimates that}} up to 12,000 {{people have been killed}} in the violence, with many more dying from disease and malnutrition as a direct result of the conflict. Nearly two million civilians have been forced to flee their homes, living in internally <b>displaced</b> <b>person</b> (IDP) camps and within the safety of larger settlements, sleeping on street corners and in other public spaces. The problems of the camps have been expatiated by the government ordering villagers into the camps on pain of being classified as rebels and on occasion shelling those villages who refused to relocate.|$|E

25|$|In July 1944, {{fearing the}} second Soviet occupation, Puzinas retreated to Germany where he {{taught at the}} Baltic University in Pinneberg near Hamburg in West Germany. He was the {{university}} rector from April 1948 to September 1949. While in Germany, Puzinas published five articles on archaeological topics based on data he brought from Lithuania. A German-language article on fibula, dedicated to Puzinas' former mentor Ernst Wahle, was well received and cited by German and Polish archaeologists. In 1949, as a <b>displaced</b> <b>person,</b> Puzinas moved to Philadelphia, United States. He worked various jobs, but also joined activities of Lithuanian diaspora. In 1953–1969, he contributed to and edited the 35-volume Lietuvių enciklopedija and later the 6-volume Encyclopedia Lituanica. Even without the ability to conduct excavations, Puzinas wrote archaeological studies, mostly on regional (Švėkšna, Panevėžys/Upytė, Suvalkija) and urban issues (Vilnius Castle Complex, Old Hrodna Castle). He also wrote reviews of works published, often by his former students, in Soviet Lithuania. He started writing a broad work on prehistory of Lithuania, but managed to finish only a few sections.|$|E
25|$|An {{asylum seeker}} is a <b>displaced</b> <b>person</b> or {{immigrant}} who has formally sought {{the protection of}} the state they fled to as well as the right to remain in this country and who is waiting for a decision on this formal application. An asylum seeker may have applied for Convention refugee status or for complementary forms of protection. Asylum is thus a category that includes different forms of protection. Which form of protection is offered depends on the legal definition that best describes the asylum seeker's reasons to flee. Once the decision was made the asylum seeker will either be given Convention refugee status or a complementary form of protection and can stay in the country, or will be refused asylum and then often has to leave. Only after the state, territory or the UNHCR, wherever the application was made, has recognised the protection needs, the asylum seeker will be officially referred to as a refugee in the more specific context and enjoys refugee status. This carries certain rights and obligations according to the legislation of the receiving country.|$|E

Faced with more than 1.5million people displaced from their homes, MSF set up relief programmes in internally <b>displaced</b> <b>person</b> (IDP) camps to provide clean water, food and sanitation. Diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, polio, cholera, ebola, and HIV/AIDS occur in epidemics in the country, and volunteers provide vaccinations (in the cases of measles and polio) and/or treatment to the residents. Mental health is also an important aspect of medical treatment for MSF teams in Uganda since most people refuse to leave the IDP camps for constant fear of being attacked.|$|E
