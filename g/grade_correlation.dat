40|$|There {{is a lot}} of {{interest}} in positive dependence going beyond linear correlation. In this paper three new rank tests for testing independence against positive dependence are introduced. The first one is directed on positive quadrant dependence, the second and third one concentrate on positive function dependence. The new testing procedures are not only sensitive for positive <b>grade</b> linear <b>correlation,</b> but also for positive <b>grade</b> <b>correlations</b> of higher order. They are based on the principle of data driven tests, which consists of three steps. Firstly, parametric families are introduced spanning up the space of null hypothesis and alternatives; secondly, within the families good tests are used; thirdly, a selection rule determines the appropriate model. The new tests improve standard tests for linear correlation as Spearman's rank correlation test substantially in case some proper higher order correlations are exhibited by the data, while the loss in power under alternatives with dominating linear correlation is not very high. Monte Carlo results clearly show this behavior...|$|R

40|$|Background: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the reliability of TCD in evaluation of vertebrobasilar arteries in comparison with brain MRA in patients suffering from acute vertebrobasilar stroke. Methods: Samples were patients with definite clinical diagnosis of vertebrobasilar stroke. For all patients brain MRI, MRA and TCD were performed during the first 48 hours of admission. Basilar artery was insonated at the depth of 75 to 85 mm and vertebral arteries were insonated at the depth of 45 to 55 mm. On brain MRA, the degree of stenosis in vertebrobasilar arteries was graded from I (normal) to IV (total stenosis) and the <b>correlation</b> between the <b>grade</b> of stenosis and TCD indices were studied. Results: Spearman correlation test revealed a significant correlation between mean flow velocity (MFV) and MRA <b>grading</b> (<b>correlation</b> coefficient = - 0. 486) as well as end diastolic velocity (EDV) and MRA <b>grading</b> (<b>correlation</b> coefficient = - 0. 323) with no significant correlation between pulsatility index, peak systolic velocity and MRA grading (p > 0. 05). One way ANOVA analysis showed that there was only significant mean MFV and mean EDV difference between grade 1 and other grades. Conclusions: TCD was only able to differentiate between stenotic and normal pattern and could not assist in the grading of stenosis. On the other hand, in acute vertebrobasilar stroke that TCD performed blindly without visualization of arteries and in a fixed depth it might have limited value in the grading of vertebrobasilar system stenosis...|$|R

40|$|We use the {{principle}} of maximum entropy to propose a parsimonious model for the generation of simulated rainfall during the wettest three-month season at a typical location {{on the east coast}} of Australia. The model uses a checkerboard copula of maximum entropy to model the joint probability distribution for total seasonal rainfall and a set of two-parameter gamma distributions to model each of the marginal monthly rainfall totals. The model allows us to match the <b>grade</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficients for the checkerboard copula to the observed Spearman rank correlation coefficients for the monthly rainfalls and, hence, provides a model that correctly describes the mean and variance for each of the monthly totals and also for the overall seasonal total.

Degree of intratumoral susceptibility signal (ITSS) on SWI correlates with rCBV ratio and histopathological grade. This study investigated the effectiveness of ITSS grading and rCBV ratio in preoperative assessment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients (17 males and 14 females) with histopathogical diagnosis of glial tumor undergoing routine cranial MRI, SWI, and perfusion MRI examinations between October 2011 and July 2013 were retrospectively enrolled. All examinations were performed using 3 T apparatus with 32 -channel head coil. We used ITSS number for SWI <b>grading.</b> <b>Correlations</b> between SWI <b>grade,</b> rCBV ratio, and pathological grading were evaluated.

Two different materials of nodular iron (GGG 40 and GGG 60) as well as malleable cast iron (GTS 45) were available. The multiaxial stochastic loading resulted from the superposition of tensile and torsional loading. Two extreme cases for the <b>grade</b> of <b>correlation</b> of both loads, the linear correlated and the uncorrelated loading were taken into account. For the failure in each case nominal strains in the most highly loaded cross-section are decisive.

The reference strain is not only a value related to the material behaviour, but takes also account for the statistical interaction of the uncorrelated loads based on the independance of casual values.

COPD severity may be {{evaluated by the}} Global initiative for chronic ­Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) combined risk assessment score (GOLD score). Spirometry, body plethysmography, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and high-resolution computed tomography (HR-CT) measure lung function and elucidate pulmonary pathology. This study assesses associations between GOLD score and measurements of lung function in COPD patients with and without (≤ 1) comorbidities. It evaluates whether the presence of comorbidities influences evaluation by GOLD score of COPD severity, and questions whether GOLD score describes morbidity rather than COPD severity. Methods: In this prospective study, 106 patients with stable COPD were included. Patients treated for lung cancer were excluded. Demographics, oxygen saturation (SpO 2), modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale, COPD exacerbations, and comorbidities were recorded. Body plethysmography and DLCO were measured, and HR-CT performed and evaluated for emphysema and airways disease. COPD severity was stratified by the GOLD score. Correlation analyses: 1) GOLD score, 2) emphysema grade, and 3) airways disease and lung function parameters, described by: forced expiratory volume in the first second in percent of expected value (FEV 1 %), inspiratory capacity (IC%), total lung volume (TLC%), IC/TLC, and SpO 2. Correlation analyses between subgroups and hierarchical cluster analysis were performed. Results: Significant associations were found between GOLD score and both emphysema <b>grade</b> (<b>correlation</b> coefficients [cc]: - 0. 2, P= 0. 03) and lung function parameters (cc: - 0. 5 to - 0. 7, P-values all 1 comorbidity (cc: - 0. 4 to - 0. 5, P-values all 0. 001). Significant differences between subgroups were found in GOLD score and both FEV 1 % (cc: - 0. 2, P= 0. 02) and IC/TLC (cc: - 0. 2, P= 0. 02). Comorbidities were associated with GOLD score and composite measures in hierarchical cluster analysis. Conclusion: The presence of comorbidities influences the relationship between GOLD score and lung function measurements. GOLD score may be more representative of morbidity than of COPD severity.

40|$|Context: Assigning {{grade to}} breast cancer on FNAC {{provides}} prognostic information and guides optimal therapy. Aims: The present study was undertaken to grade breast carcinoma on cytology by Robinson's grading system and correlate it with Elstons modified Bloom Richardson histological grading system. Settings and Design: It is a prospective study done on fifty cases of breast cancer reported on cytology. Materials and Methods: Fifty patients who underwent FNAC and mastectomy for breast carcinoma were cytologically and histologically <b>graded.</b> <b>Correlation</b> between cytological and histological grading system was determined. Sensitivity and specificity of Robinson's cytological grading system was calculated in each grade. All cases evaluated for presence of metastasis to axillary lymph nodes. Statistical Analysis Used: Correlation between cytological and histological grading was established using the non parametric Spearmanâ€™s correlation coefficient. Results: Concordance rate between cytological and histological grade was 78 %. The coefficient of <b>correlation</b> between cytological <b>grade</b> and histological grade was 0. 804 and P value was < 0. 001 which indicated a strong correlation and significant association between the cytological and histological grade. Sensitivity was maximum in cytological grade I tumors (100 %) and least in cytological grade III tumors (45. 45 %). Specificity was maximum in cytological grade III tumors (94. 87 %) and least in cytological grade II tumors (72. 72 %). The incidence of axillary lymph node metastasis was maximum in cytological grade III tumors and grade I tumors. Conclusions: Cytological grade strongly predicts histological grade and is useful in selecting neoadjuvant chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|We studied cell cycle–regulating {{proteins}} in phyllodes tumor pathogenesis by immunohistochemical analysis for Ki- 67, cyclin A, cyclin D 1, retinoblastoma protein (pRb), p 53, p 16 INK 4 A, bcl- 2, and p 21 waf 1 in the epithelium and stroma of 40 primary (benign, 21; borderline, 8; malignant, 11) and 7 recurrent tumors of different grades. In most cases, the epithelium showed no altered expression of cell cycle regulators. Stromal overexpression of p 16 INK 4 A, p 53, cyclin A, pRb, and p 21 waf 1 correlated significantly with tumor grade. The number of altered {{proteins in}} stroma increased with higher grade and {{was accompanied by}} increased proliferation. Stromal cyclin A expression was the best separating marker between tumor <b>grades.</b> <b>Correlations</b> existed between stromal overexpression of p 16 INK 4 A and p 21 waf 1, p 16 INK 4 A and p 53, and p 53 and pRb. No immunostaining differences were detected between primary tumors and recurrences. Four or more altered proteins and p 53 expression in the stromal component were independent negative prognosticators for diseasefree survival. The stromal component of mammary phyllodes tumors displays an increasing level of cell cycle deregulation with higher tumor grade; the epithelial compartment mostly remains inconspicuous. Several combinations of aberrantly expressed cell cycle proteins seem important in the stromal progression of phyllodes tumors. The number of stromal cell cycle aberrations and stromal p 53 expression might predict clinical behavior...|$|R
40|$|A {{new system}} of multivariate {{distributions}} with fixed marginal distributions is introduced via the consideration of random variates that are randomly chosen pairs of order statistics of the marginal distributions. The distributions allow arbitrary positive or negative Pearson correlations between pairs of random variates and generalise the Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern distribution. It is shown that the copulas of these distributions are special cases of the Bernstein copula. Generation of random numbers from the distributions is described, and formulas for the Kendall and <b>grade</b> (Spearman) <b>correlations</b> are given. Procedures for data fitting are described and illustrated with examples. 62 Exx Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern distribution Marginal distribution Copula. Bernstein polynomials Bezier surface...|$|R
