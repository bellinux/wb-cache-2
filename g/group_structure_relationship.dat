Although these systems were first described by Schulman in 1943, {{only in the}} last 20 years have they attracted much scientific and technological attention. Their potential applications range from enhanced oil recovery to pharmaceuticals. Only recently has work on microemulsion systems in detergent applications been addressed.

These models combine the ideas of mixture models, regression models, and variable selection to uncover <b>group</b> <b>structures</b> and key <b>relationships</b> between data sets. The objective is to identify homogeneous groups of objects and determine the cluster-specific subsets of covariates modulating the outcomes. In this chapter we review frequentist and Bayesian methods we have proposed to address in a unified manner the problems of cluster identification and cluster-specific variable selection in the context of mixture of regression models. These methods have a wide range of applications, in particular in the context of high-dimensional data analysis. We illustrate their performance in two diverse areas: one in ecology for modeling species-rich ecosystems and the other in genomics for integrating data from different genomic sources.

However, up to now, the effect of <b>group</b> <b>structure</b> to crowd behavior has not been widely studied. This is partially {{due to the fact}} that modeling group-related behavior is a challenging task because of the many factors that need to be considered.

Both intra-group <b>structure</b> and inter-group <b>relationships</b> are considered and their effects on the group behavior are modeled.

As private entities not clearly {{accountable to the}} public, these ‘Olympic Corporations’ {{have been accused of}} bypassing normal planning and development protocols, transforming the nature of host cities with little stakeholder consultation. This research employs Giddens’ theory of social structuration as a lens to understand the evolution of relationships between Vancouver 2010 ’s Olympic Corporation and Cypress Olympic Venue (COV) stakeholders. The project suggests that because a balance of power existed between the Olympic Corporation and stakeholder <b>groups,</b> the <b>relationship</b> <b>structure</b> transformed from an antagonistic to a more amicable configuration through successive interactions. While the Olympic Corporation’s stakeholder engagement strategies appear successful at the COV, stakeholder respondents exhibit skepticism about Olympic organizers.

40|$|Typical {{business}} groups are widely diversified into unrelated industries. Scholars have explained {{this as a}} consequence of institutional weaknesses and predicted that {{business groups}} would lose their effectiveness and increasingly refocus as institutional environments improve. In this dissertation, I suggest a new perspective on business groups by revisiting their hybrid nature and focusing on the fact that two different boundaries exist for business group member firms. I differentiate between group-level diversification and firm-level diversification and argue that they serve different purposes, which lead to divergent patterns of diversification. First, at the business group level, I question the appropriateness of applying the concept of relatedness to the diversification of a business group. Emphasizing the hybrid nature of the business group, I argue that its purpose of diversification may be more to provide the group?s member firms with critical resources than to obtain synergies from operating in related industries. Relying on the insights from the input-output model, I propose the idea that business groups are more likely to enter industries that have linkages to multiple other industries than to follow the relatedness criterion. I test the idea using the data of 30 major South Korean business groups? diversification from 1999 to 2008 and find an empirical support. Second, at the member firm level, I focus on the importance of group-level characteristics on member firms? diversification choices. Emphasizing economic incentives, I propose that the business <b>group</b> <b>structure</b> and <b>relationships</b> within it affect its member firms? strategic orientation and choices in ways that may satisfy the needs of both the controlling shareholders and minority shareholders. I theorize that the size, the degree of diversification, and the proportion of intragroup transaction of a business group would affect diversification choices of its member firms. Based on the data of 108 public member firms of 30 major South Korean business groups, I find empirical support for most of my hypotheses. The implication of my dissertation is that the business group may be not just a coping mechanism for underdeveloped institutions, but an organizational innovation that can work in any institutional environment...|$|R
