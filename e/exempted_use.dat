30|$|Chlorinated {{paraffins}} (CPs) are the chlorinated semivolatile {{organic compounds}} {{with the highest}} production volume (1 million tonne/year), and were main substitutes for PCBs in open applications [315]. In May 2017, short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) were listed as POPs under the Stockholm Convention, {{with a range of}} <b>exempted</b> <b>uses</b> [109]. For medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs), a recent review also documented similar persistence and accumulation challenges [284]. Chlorinated paraffins bioaccumulate in meat/fat [316, 317] and might pose a risk for the future safe production of food from animal origin, considering their large use volumes in open applications and bioaccumulation potential. High levels of chlorinated paraffins (short-, medium- and long-chain chlorinated paraffins) have been detected in wildlife in China, accounting for more than 95 % of all POPs detected in the biota [318, 319]. CPs in sewage sludge are in the mg/kg range [320, 321], and are currently transferred to agricultural soils via this pathway, accumulating and eventually contaminating food-producing animals and wildlife. SCCPs and MCCPs are also transferred from food contact materials such as baking ovens [322] or food blenders [323] to food and human intake.|$|R
