Cet shames the challenger Óengus son of Lam Gabuid, by recounting <b>how</b> he had cut off Lam Gabuid's hands in battle; he shames Éogan son of Durthacht, the king of Fermag, by recounting <b>how</b> he put out his eye in a cattle-raid; he reminds Muinremur son of Gerrgend <b>how</b> he had taken his son's head as a trophy not six days earlier; Mend son of Salchad, <b>how</b> he had cut off his father's foot; Celtchair son of Uthecar, <b>how</b> he had castrated him with his spear; and even Conchobar's son Cúscraid Mend Machae, <b>how</b> he had pierced his neck with a spear during Cúscraid's first feat of arms, in ignominious circumstances which led to the abandonment a third of Cúscraid's retinue in a cowardly retreat. In each case, the challenging warriors are compelled to retake their seats in shame.|$|E
