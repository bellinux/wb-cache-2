40|$|Hemodialysis (HD) {{is one of}} the {{important}} modalities of renal replacement therapy in acute renal failure (ARF) as well as chronic renal failure (CRF). This study was performed to evaluate the various intradialytic complications that occur during HD and their management. This is a retrospective study performed in patients who underwent conventional HD during the period of 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2011 at our center. Clinical details, various complications faced and their management were retrieved from dialysis case sheets. A total of 2325 patients of renal failure (790 ARF and 1535 CRF patients) were assessed for the intradialytic complications of HD. During the study period, there were 12, 785 bicarbonate dialyses performed on these patients. In the ARF patients, the common intradialytic complications were: Hypotension, seen <b>in</b> 1296 <b>sessions</b> (30. 4 %), nausea and vomiting seen <b>in</b> 1125 <b>sessions</b> (26. 4 %), fever and chills seen <b>in</b> 818 <b>sessions</b> (19. 2 %), headache seen <b>in</b> 665 <b>sessions</b> (15. 6 %), cramps seen <b>in</b> 85 <b>sessions</b> (2. 0 %), chest pain and back pain seen <b>in</b> 82 <b>sessions</b> (1. 92 %), hypoglycemia seen <b>in</b> 77 <b>sessions</b> (1. 8 %), first-use syndrome seen <b>in</b> 72 <b>sessions</b> (1. 7 %) and femoral hematoma seen <b>in</b> 31 <b>sessions</b> (0. 73 %). In the CRF group, common complications were hypotension <b>in</b> 2230 <b>sessions</b> (26. 1 %), nausea and vomiting <b>in</b> 1211 <b>sessions</b> (14. 2 %), fever and chills <b>in</b> 1228 <b>sessions</b> (14. 4 %), chest pain and back pain in 1108 cases (13. 0 %), hypertension <b>in</b> 886 <b>sessions</b> (10. 4 %), headache <b>in</b> 886 <b>sessions</b> (10. 4 %), cramps <b>in</b> 256 <b>sessions</b> (3. 0 %), hematoma <b>in</b> 55 <b>sessions</b> (0. 64 %), intracerebral hemorrhage <b>in</b> three <b>sessions</b> (0. 03 %) and catheter tip migration <b>in</b> three <b>sessions</b> (0. 03 %). There is a need for special attention for the diagnosis and management of intradialytic complications of HD because such complications could be managed successfully without the need for termination of the dialysis procedure...|$|R

5|$|On December 17, 1851, Henry Clay {{submitted}} {{a letter of}} resignation of his seat in the U.S. Senate, to be effective September 1 of the following year (1852).

The majority of the Assembly was Whig, and Clay {{knew that if he}} resigned while the Assembly was <b>in</b> <b>session,</b> the majority would elect a Whig to be his successor. By contrast, if he had waited until September 1 to announce his resignation the Assembly would already have closed its session, and Governor Powell, a Democrat, would appoint a temporary successor until the legislature convened again two years later.|$|E

5|$|The Central Committee {{was not a}} {{permanent}} institution. It convened plenary sessions.
