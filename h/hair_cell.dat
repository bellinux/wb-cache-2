25|$|The {{molecular}} composition between conventional neuronal synapse and ribbon synapse {{is surprisingly}} dissimilar. At {{the core of}} synaptic vesicle exocytosis machinery in vertebrate neuronal synapses is the SNARE complex. The minimally functional SNARE complex includes syntaxin 1, VAMP 1 and 2, and SNAP-25. In contrast, genetic ablation or application of botulinum, targeting SNAP-25, syntaxin 1-3, and VAMP 1-3, did not affect inner <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> ribbon synapse exocytosis in mice. Additionally, no neuronal SNAREs were observed in hair cells using immunostaining, pointing {{to the possibility of}} a different exocytosis mechanism. However, several studies found SNARE mRNA and protein expressed in <b>hair</b> <b>cell,</b> perhaps indicating presence of a neuronal SNARE complex in ribbon synapse that is present in low levels and with very redundant components.|$|E
50|$|The stereocilia (<b>hair</b> <b>cells)</b> of {{the inner}} ear can become {{subjected}} to bending from loud noises. Because they are not regeneratable in humans, any major damage or loss of these <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> leads to permanent hearing impairment and other hearing-related diseases.

50|$|<b>Hair</b> <b>cells</b> are {{the sensory}} receptors {{of both the}} {{auditory}} system and the vestibular system in the ears of all vertebrates. Through mechanotransduction, <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> detect movement in their environment. In mammals, the auditory <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> are located within the spiral organ of Corti on the thin basilar membrane in the cochlea of the inner ear. They derive their name from the tufts of stereocilia called hair bundles that protrude from the apical surface of the cell into the fluid-filled cochlear duct. Mammalian cochlear <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> are of two anatomically and functionally distinct types, known as outer, and inner <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Damage to these <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> results in decreased hearing sensitivity, and because the inner ear <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> cannot regenerate, this damage is permanent. However, other organisms, such as the frequently studied zebrafish, and birds have <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> that can regenerate.The human cochlea contains {{on the order of}} 3,500 inner <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and 12,000 outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> at birth.|$|R
50|$|Cochlear <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> are {{organized}} as inner <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and outer <b>hair</b> cells; {{inner and outer}} refer to relative position from the axis of the cochlear spiral. The inner <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> are the primary sensory receptors and {{a significant amount of}} the sensory input to the auditory cortex occurs from these <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> on the other hand boost the mechanical signal by using electromechanical feedback.|$|R
25|$|Deiters' cells (phalangeal cells) are {{a type of}} neuroglial cell {{found in}} the organ of Corti and {{organised}} in one row of inner phalangeal cells and three rows of outer phalangeal cells.

25|$|During {{exocytosis}} at the bipolar ribbon synapse, vesicles {{are seen}} to pause at the membrane and then upon opening of the calcium channels to promptly release their contents within milliseconds. Like most exocytosis, Ca2+ regulates the release of vesicles from the presynaptic membrane. Different types of ribbon synapses have different dependence on Ca2+ releases. The <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> ribbon synapses exhibit a steep dependence on Ca2+ concentration, while the photoreceptor synapses is less steeply dependent on Ca2+ and is stimulated by much lower levels of free Ca2+. The <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> ribbon synapse experiences spontaneous activity {{in the absence of}} stimuli, under conditions of a constant <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> membrane potential. Voltage clamp at the postsynaptic bouton showed that the bouton experiences a wide range of excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes. The current amplitude distribution is a positive-skew, with a range of larger amplitudes for both spontaneous and stimulus evoked release. It was thought that this current distribution was not explainable with single vesicle release, and other scenarios of release have been proposed: coordinated multivesicular release, kiss-and-run, or compound fusion of vesicles prior to exocytosis. However it has been recently proposed that uniquantal release with fusion pore flickering is the most plausible interpretation of the found current distribution. In fact, the charge distribution of currents is actually normally distributed, supporting the uniquantal release scenario. It has been shown that the skewness of the current amplitude distribution is well explained by different time courses of neurotransmitter release of a single vesicles with a flickering fusion pore.|$|E
25|$|Simultaneously, Mary F. Lyon began {{investigating}} {{manipulations of}} X-linked traits that had phenotypically visible consequences, particularly in mice, whose fur color is a trait intimately {{linked to the}} X chromosome. Building on work done by Ohno and his colleagues, Lyon eventually proved that either the maternal or paternal X chromosome is randomly inactivated in every cell of the female body in the species she was studying, which explained the heterogeneous fur patterns she observed in her mosaic mice. This process is known as X-inactivation, and is {{sometimes referred to as}} “lyonization”. This discovery can be easily extrapolated to explain the mixed color patterns observed in the coats of tortoiseshell cats. The fur patterns characteristic of tortoiseshell cats are found almost exclusively in females, because only they randomly inactivate one X chromosome in every somatic <b>hair</b> <b>cell.</b> Thus, presuming that hair color determining genes are X-linked, it makes sense that whether the maternal or paternal X chromosome is inactivated in a particular <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> can result in differential fur color expression.|$|E

40|$|Vestibular <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> in {{the inner}} ear encode head {{movements}} and mediate the sense of balance. These cells undergo cell death and replacement (turnover) throughout life in non-mammalian vertebrates. However, there is no definitive evidence that this process occurs in mammals. We used fate-mapping and other methods to demonstrate that utricular type II vestibular <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> undergo turnover in adult mice under normal conditions. We found that supporting cells phagocytose both type I and II <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Plp 1 -CreER(T 2) -expressing supporting cells replace type II <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Type I <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> are not restored by Plp 1 -CreER(T 2) -expressing supporting cells or by Atoh 1 -CreER(TM) -expressing type II <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Destruction of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> causes supporting cells to generate 6 times as many type II <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> compared to normal conditions.

40|$|<b>Hair</b> <b>cells</b> in the auditory, vestibular, and lateral-line systems {{respond to}} {{mechanical}} stimulation and transmit information to afferent nerve fibers. The sensitivity of mechanoelectrical transduction is modulated by the efferent pathway, whose activity usually reduces the responsiveness of <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> The {{basis of this}} effect remains unknown. We employed immunocytological, electrophysiological, and micromechanical approaches to characterize the anatomy of efferent innervation {{and the effect of}} efferent activity on the electrical and mechanical properties of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> in the bullfrog's sacculus. We found that efferent fibers form extensive synaptic terminals on all macular and extramacular <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Macular <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> expressing the Ca(2 +) -buffering protein calretinin contain half as many synaptic ribbons and are innervated by twice as many efferent terminals as calretinin-negative <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Efferent activity elicits inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and thus inhibits their electrical resonance.

25|$|Sonic {{hedgehog}} {{may play}} a role in mammalian <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration. By modulating retinoblastoma protein activity in rat cochlea, sonic hedgehog allows mature hair cells that normally cannot return to a proliferative state to divide and differentiate. Retinoblastoma proteins suppress cell growth by preventing cells from returning to the cell cycle, thereby preventing proliferation. Inhibiting the activity of Rb seems to allow cells to divide. Therefore, sonic hedgehog, identified as an important regulator of Rb, may also prove to be an important feature in regrowing hair cells after damage.|$|E
25|$|Postsynaptic {{structures}} differ for cochlear {{cells and}} photoreceptor cells. Hair cells {{is capable of}} one action potential propagation for one vesicle release. One vesicle release from the presynaptic <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> onto the postsynaptic bouton is enough to create an action potential in the auditory afferent cells. Photoreceptors allow one vesicle release for many action potential propagation. The rod terminal and cone ribbon synapse of the photoreceptors have horizontal synaptic spines expressing AMPA receptors with additional bipolar dendrites exhibiting the mGluR6 receptors. These structures allow for the binding of multiple molecules of glutamate, allowing for the propagation of many action potentials.|$|E
25|$|The ribbon synapse {{is a type}} of {{neuronal}} synapse {{characterized by}} the presence of an electron-dense structure, the synaptic ribbon, that holds vesicles close to the active zone. It is characterized by a tight vesicle-calcium channel coupling that promotes rapid neurotransmitter release and sustained signal transmission. Ribbon synapses undergo a cycle of exocytosis and endocytosis in response to graded changes of membrane potential. It has been proposed that most ribbon synapses undergo a special type of exocytosis based on coordinated multivesicular release. This interpretation has recently been questioned at the inner <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> ribbon synapse, where it has been instead proposed that exocytosis is described by uniquantal (i.e., univesicular) release shaped by a flickering vesicle fusion pore.|$|E

50|$|The outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> or OHCs, can {{be thought}} of as microamplifiers that provide {{stimulation}} to the inner <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> The OHCs are the most fragile of the <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> hence their involvement in auditory fatigue and other hearing impairments.|$|R
25|$|The <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> are {{arranged}} in four rows in the organ of Corti along {{the entire length of}} the cochlear coil. Three rows consist of outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> (OHCs) and one row consists of inner <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> (IHCs). The inner <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> provide the main neural output of the cochlea. The outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> instead, mainly receive neural input from the brain, which influences their motility as part of the cochlea's mechanical pre-amplifier.

2500|$|As {{the study}} of the cochlea should {{fundamentally}} be focused at the level of hair cells, {{it is important to note}} the anatomical and physiological differences between the hair cells of various species. [...] In birds, for instance, instead of outer and inner hair cells, there are tall and short hair cells. [...] There are several similarities of note in regard to this comparative data. [...] For one, the tall <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> is very similar in function to that of the inner <b>hair</b> <b>cell,</b> and the short <b>hair</b> <b>cell,</b> lacking afferent auditory-nerve fiber innervation, resembles the outer <b>hair</b> <b>cell.</b> [...] One unavoidable difference, however, is that while all hair cells are attached to a tectorial membrane in birds, only the outer hair cells are attached to the tectorial membrane in mammals.|$|E
2500|$|In mammals, {{otoliths}} {{are small}} particles, {{composed of a}} combination of a gelatinous matrix and calcium carbonate in the viscous fluid of the saccule and utricle. The inertia of these small particles causes them to stimulate hair cells when the head moves. The hair cells are made up of 40 to 70 stereocilia and one kinocilium, which is connected to an afferent nerve. When the body changes position or begins a movement the weight of the membrane bends the stereocilia and stimulates the hair cells. Hair cells send signals down sensory nerve fibers, which are interpreted by the brain as motion. The brain interprets the orientation of the head by comparing the input from the utricules and saccules from both ears to the input from the eyes, allowing the brain to discriminate a tilted head from movement of the entire body. When the head is in a normal upright position, the otolith presses on the sensory <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> receptors. [...] This pushes the <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> processes down and prevents them from moving side to side. However, when the head is tilted, the pull of gravity on otoliths shift the <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> processes to the side, distorting them and sending a message to the central nervous system that the head is no longer level but now tilted. (see: BPPV) This theory may have to be reevaluated because of an experiment in which a blindfolded owl in zero gravity was able to keep its head level while a handler was rocking its body back and forth.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe hearing organ {{contains}} sensory <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> which convert sound-evoked vibration {{into action}} potentials in the auditory nerve. This process is greatly enhanced by molecular motors that reside within the outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> but the performance {{also depends on}} passive mechanical properties, such as the stiffness, mass, and friction of the structures within the organ of Corti. We used resampled confocal imaging to study the mechanical properties of the low-frequency regions of the cochlea.

The strain was caused by differences in the motion trajectories of inner and outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Motion perpendicular to the reticular lamina was greater at the outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> but inner <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> showed greater radial vibration. These differences led to deformation of the reticular lamina, which connects the apex of the outer and inner <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> These results are important for understanding how the molecular motors of the outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> can so profoundly affect auditory sensitivity...|$|R

40|$|In turtle {{posterior}} cristae, cholinergic vestibular efferent neurons (VENs) synapse on type II <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> bouton afferents innervating type II <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> and afferent calyces innervating type I <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Electrical {{stimulation of}} VENs releases acetylcholine (ACh) at these synapses to exert diverse effects on afferent background discharge including rapid inhibition of bouton afferents and excitation of calyx-bearing afferents. Efferent-mediated inhibition is most pronounced in bouton afferents innervating type II <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> near the torus, but becomes progressively smaller and briefer when moving longitudinally through the crista toward afferents innervating the planum. Sharp-electrode recordings have inferred that efferent-mediated inhibition of bouton afferents requires the sequential activation of alpha 9 -containing nicotinic ACh receptors (α 9 *nAChRs) and small-conductance, calcium-dependent potassium channels (SK) in type II <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Gradations in {{the strength of}} efferent-mediated inhibition across the crista likely reflect variations in α 9 *nAChRs and/or SK activation in type II <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> from those different regions. However, in turtle cristae, neither inference has been confirmed with direct recordings from type II <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> To address these gaps, we performed whole-cell, patch-clamp recordings from type II <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> within a split-epithelial preparation of the turtle posterior crista. Here, we can easily visualize and record <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> while maintaining their native location within the neuroepithelium.
