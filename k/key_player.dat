40|$|Abstract A {{procedure}} is described for finding sets of <b>key</b> <b>players</b> {{in a social}} network. A key assumption is that the optimal selection of <b>key</b> <b>players</b> depends on what they are needed for. Accordingly, two generic goals are articulated, called KPP-POS and KPP-NEG. KPP-POS {{is defined as the}} identification of <b>key</b> <b>players</b> for the purpose of optimally diffusing something through the network by using the <b>key</b> <b>players</b> as seeds. KPP-NEG is defined as the identification of <b>key</b> <b>players</b> for the purpose of disrupting or fragmenting the network by removing the key nodes. It is found that off-the-shelf centrality measures are not optimal for solving either generic problem, and therefore new measures are presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} information theory to identify sets of <b>key</b> <b>players</b> in social networks. First, we define two entropy measures that we use to analyze the structural properties of a social network. Then, we propose a new method aimed at finding a set of <b>key</b> <b>players</b> that solves the KPP-Neg and KPP-Pos problems. Our preliminary experimental {{results indicate that the}} entropy measures can be used effectively to identify a set of <b>key</b> <b>players</b> in a social network...|$|R
