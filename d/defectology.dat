40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the role that}} conceptualisations of child ‘imperfection’ played in {{the rise and fall}} of Russian ‘child study’ between the 1900 s and the 1930 s. Drawing on Georges Canguilhem’s ideas on ‘the normal’ and ‘the pathological’, the article analyses practices centred on diagnosing subnormality and pathology in the Russian child population in the late tsarist and early Soviet eras. It first examines mutually competing normative regimes that framed categorisations of ‘imperfection’ among Russia’s children in the context of the empire’s accelerated, yet ambivalent modernisation during the 1900 s– 1910 s. It then charts the expansion of this diagnostics in the first decade or so of the Soviet regime, following its shift in focus from the early- 1920 s’ ‘delinquent child’ to the late- 1920 s’ ‘mass child’. The article concludes with a discussion of the emergence, over this same period, of the Russian field of medicalised special education known as ‘defectology’. It argues that <b>defectology’s</b> disciplinary specificity crystallised in 1936 around a purposely restrictive concept of ‘imperfection’, understood as individualised and clinically established pathological ‘impairment’. The latter conceptualisation became fixed at the height of Stalinism as a strategic counter to the expansive flux in which the diagnostics and conceptualisation of child ‘imperfection’ had otherwise been over the first three decades of the twentieth century in the context of the remarkable rise of child study during this period...|$|R

5000|$|Vygotsky was a {{pioneering}} psychologist and his major works span six separate volumes, written over roughly 10 years, from Psychology of Art (1925) to Thought and Language Thinking and Speech (1934). Vygotsky's {{interests in the}} fields of developmental psychology, child development, and education were extremely diverse. His philosophical framework includes interpretations of the cognitive role of mediation tools, as well as the re-interpretation of well-known concepts in psychology such as internalization of knowledge. Vygotsky introduced the notion of zone of proximal development, a metaphor capable of describing the potential of human cognitive development. His work covered topics such as the origin and the psychology of art, development of higher mental functions, philosophy of science and methodology of psychological research, the relation between learning and human development, concept formation, interrelation between language and thought development, play as a psychological phenomenon, learning disabilities, and abnormal human development (aka <b>defectology).</b> His scientific thinking underwent several major transformations throughout his career, but generally Vygotsky's legacy can be divided into two fairly distinct periods and the transitional phase between the two during which Vygotsky experienced the crisis in his theory and personal life. These are the mechanistic [...] "instrumental" [...] period of the 1920s, integrative [...] "holistic" [...] period of the 1930s, and the transitional years of, roughly, 1929-1931. Each of these periods is characterized by its distinct themes and theoretical innovations.|$|E
5000|$|In 1917, the Russian Revolution {{resulted}} in Soviet ideology that {{centered around the}} idea of creating a society free of anomalies. As such, children born with disabilities were considered [...] "defective," [...] and the [...] "policy on [...] "defectology" [...] was developed through resolutions passed by the Council of Ministers of the USSR." [...] According to law, parents had {{to send their children to}} institutions, as familial care was viewed as inadequate for the upbringing of children with special needs; the state found it necessary to correct such disabilities, and the provision of necessary treatment was promised. Such policies were influenced by Lev Vygotsky's Institute of <b>Defectology,</b> which was based on the idea that all children should be corrected to have normal functioning. If they were unable to participate and meet the requirements of [...] "normal" [...] standards when attending school, they were considered to be [...] "uneducable" [...] and were subject to a life of institutionalization, isolated and segregated from the public. Schools did not have the flexibility to adjust to their needs. The establishment of social segregation was widely accepted, and a distinct separation between individuals with disabilities and the rest of society was part of everyday life in Russia. Early isolation of these individuals was not specific to the early years, as it continued unto adult life due to laws that grouped citizens with disabilities into one area of employment, further alienating them from society.|$|E

40|$|The current {{interest}} of this professional and social problem is complex in regard with more aspects, {{due to the}} fact that the standardization of terminology use has wide meaning in the treatment of people with disabilities which essentially determine certain contents, aspects and actions. In this paper, conditionally, for all people with disability, according to the classification used in the Republic of Macedonia, the term disability is used. In practice and in communication, as well as in literature and legal regulations, a large number of different terms are used, which cause problems in protection, education and rehabilitation of people with disabilities. This paper presents a survey of the most used terms in international and national documents as well as in certain European countries and makes a conclusion that those are the terms: disability (as a general term) and children with special educational needs (when the term is used only for children). The paper refers to the terms for <b>defectology</b> and special education, giving the answer that there is no sign of equality between these two terms. Stating that special education is a part of defectological science, it concludes that besides the term <b>defectology</b> which is used in our country, in international communication the term special rehabilitation and education to be used (which actually is the subject matter of <b>defectology</b> as a science) ...|$|E

40|$|Every {{problem of}} <b>defectology,</b> {{based on the}} {{developmental}} difficulties of the senses, intelligence, motor and early socialization, is performed {{in the area of}} the developmental nervous structures and neuromuscular links. The scientific <b>defectology,</b> today, can not exist without neuropsychological studies of perception, movement, function of intelligence and feelings. The time when determined functions develop, and the appropriate time for stimulation of those functions, for improvement of the development of perception, intelligence, movements and feelings, that means socialization. At the same time, disorders in the development are treated effectually if the structure and function of determined segments of the person are agreed and matured. Accepting the attitudes of Pijaze, that the nervous structures are dividing the capabilities and incapabilities at a given age, and that the social environment stimulates or irritates the development of those structures and functions, in this paper we give the arguments for this attitudes and methods of early diagnostics and treatment in the childhood and youth...|$|E
40|$|Clinical defectological {{diagnostics}}, {{related to}} diagnostics of each individual's impairment of his cognitive and socializing abilities, {{has been applied}} in our country for a long time. Since {{it is a new}} area in the clinical defectological work and a new form of research in <b>defectology,</b> it poses a series of problems which have not been met so far. We shall to recognize some of them in this paper and to aim at their solution. This time we shall consider only the most prominent problems towards which we direct our interventions:· When does defectological diagnostics take part in diagnosis as treatment of impairments of the handicapped person? When does it function in the process of rehabilitation? For example, is working with a dyslexic child treatment or rehabilitation?· When does the early diagnostics reveal a problem arising from inappropriate intersection of different development courses, which can sometimes be solved without any particular treatment (early stuttering, various convulsions), and when does it reveal actual condition, such as oligophrenia or autism. Thereby we ask ourselves if early stimulative treatment of oligophrenic children or children with early childhood psychosis is treatment or rehabilitation. We tried to classify end explain the problems of diagnostics in the context of treatment and rehabilitation and to define the theoretical grounds for our standpoints. We wanted to point out the unity of the process of any impairment of the handicapped person from early childhood {{to the end of his}} life. Treatment and rehabilitation should be a united process and follow the course of development of early disorders which sometimes end up as handicaps, and sometimes, thanks to the treatment, may end up in successful socialization, for example, persons with impaired hearing or sight. We establish <b>defectology</b> as a complete theoretical standpoint and expert procedure which is parallel to and complementary with medicine. The only difference we find is that physicians and clinical psychologists insist on recovering to normal the diseased or impaired functions and structures, while <b>defectology</b> develops methods by which treatment continues even though medical techniques have finished their work. Medicine improves in saving lives and <b>defectology</b> in saving the quality of those saved lives...|$|E

40|$|Therapy is {{not simply}} a domain or form of medical practice, but also a metaphor for and a {{performance}} of medicine, of its functions and status, of its distinctive mode of action upon the world. This article examines medical treatment or therapy (in Russian lechenie), as concept and practice, in what came to be known in Russia as <b>defectology</b> (defektologiia) – the discipline and occupation concerned with the study and care of children with developmental pathologies, disabilities and special needs. <b>Defectology</b> formed an impure, occupationally ambiguous, therapeutic field, which emerged between different types of expertise in the niche populated by children considered ‘difficult to cure’, ‘difficult to teach’, and ‘difficult to discipline’. The article follows the multiple genealogy of defectological therapeutics in the medical, pedagogical and juridical domains, across the late tsarist and early Soviet eras. It argues that the distinctiveness of defectological therapeutics emerged from the tensions between its biomedical, sociopedagogical and moral-juridical framings, resulting in ambiguous hybrid forms, in which medical treatment strategically interlaced with education or upbringing, on the one hand, and moral correction, on the other...|$|E
