40|$|One of {{the driving}} {{structural}} requirements of the Habitable Exo-Planet (HabEx) telescope is to maintain Line Of Sight (LOS) stability between the Primary Mirror (PM) and Secondary Mirror (SM) of 5 mas. Dynamic analyses of two configurations of a proposed (HabEx) 4 meter off-axis telescope structure were performed to predict effects of jitter on primary/secondary mirror alignment. The dynamic disturbance used as the forcing function was the James Webb Space Telescope reaction wheel assembly vibration emission specification level. The objective of these analyses was to predict "order-of-magnitude" performance for various structural configurations which will roll into efforts to define the HabEx structural design's global architecture. Two variations of the basic architectural design were analyzed. Relative motion between the PM and the SM for each <b>design</b> <b>configuration</b> are <b>reported...</b>|$|R

40|$|Hybrid active-passive damping {{treatments}} {{combine the}} reliability, low cost and robustness of viscoelastic damping treatments and the high-performance, modal selective and adaptive piezoelectric active control. Numerous hybrid damping treatments {{have been reported}} in the literature. They differ mainly by the relative positions of viscoelastic treatments, sensors and piezoelectric actuators. In this work we present an experimental analysis of three active-passive damping <b>design</b> <b>configurations</b> applied to a cantilever beam. In particular, two <b>design</b> <b>configurations</b> based on the extension mode of piezoelectric actuators combined with viscoelastic constrained layer damping treatments and one <b>design</b> <b>configuration</b> with shear piezoelectric actuators embedded in a sandwich beam with viscoelastic core are analyzed. For comparison purposes, a purely active <b>design</b> <b>configuration</b> with an extension piezoelectric actuator bonded to an elastic beam is also analyzed. The active-passive damping performance of the four <b>design</b> <b>configurations</b> is compared.

40|$|During {{the design}} of a microprocessor, Design Space Exploration (DSE) is a {{critical}} step which determines the appropriate <b>design</b> <b>configuration</b> of the microprocessor. In the computer architecture community, supervised learning techniques have been applied to DSE to build models for predicting the qualities of <b>design</b> <b>configurations.</b> For supervised learning, however, considerable simulation costs are required for attaining the labeled <b>design</b> <b>configurations.</b> Given limited resources, it is difficult to achieve high accuracy. In this paper, inspired by recent advances in semi-supervised learning, we propose the COMT approach which can exploit unlabeled <b>design</b> <b>configurations</b> to improve the models. In addition to an improved predictive accuracy, COMT is able to guide {{the design of}} microprocessors, owing to the use of comprehensible model trees. Empirical study demonstrates that COMT significantly outperforms state-of-theart DSE technique through reducing mean squared error by 30 % to 84 %, and thus, promising architectures can be attained more efficiently. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a compendium of}} work related to performance analyses of a proton electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell with two novel <b>design</b> <b>configurations.</b> The finite element based numerical analysis {{has been carried out}} to solve the numerical transport models involved in a PEM fuel cell coupled with the flow in a porous medium, charge balance, electrochemical kinetics and membrane water content. The scope of this research work focuses on improving the performance of the PEM fuel cell by optimizing the thermo-fluid properties of the reactant species instead of analysing the complex electro-chemical interactions. Two new <b>design</b> <b>configurations</b> have been numerically analyzed; in the first design approach, a perforated-type gas flow distributor is used instead of a conventional gas flow distributor such as a serpentine, straight or spiral shape; the second design approach examines the effect of reactant flow pulsation on the PEM fuel cell performance. Results obtained from the numerical analyses were also compared with the experimental data and a good agreement was found. Performance of the PEM fuel cell with a perforated-type gas distributor was analyzed at different operating and geometric conditions to explore the merits of this new <b>design</b> <b>configuration.</b> Two-dimensional numerical analyses were carried out to analyze the effect of varying the different operating parameters; threedimensional numerical analyses were carried out to study the variation of different geometric parameters on overall performance of the new <b>design</b> <b>configuration</b> of the PEM fuel cell. The effects of the reactant flow pulsation on the performance of PEM fuel cell were analyzed using a two-dimensional numerical approach where both active and passive <b>design</b> <b>configurations</b> were numerically simulated to generate the pulsations in the reactant flow. The results showed a considerable increase in overall performance of the PEM fuel cell by introducing pulsations in the flow...|$|R

Solar distillation (desalination) of salt water is suitable for supplying water for drinking and agricultural purposes to small communities where the supply of fresh water is inadequate or of poor quality and where solar radiation is abundant. Historical reviews and theoretical developments of solar distillation, including the physical and technical results of the various <b>designs</b> and <b>configurations,</b> are <b>reported.</b> This research is confined mainly to one type of solar still, an inclined free flow flat plate solar still. To study the effect of significant parameters, a mathematical two dimensional flow analysis was carried out based on continuity, momentum and energy equations for liquid and vapour flow. It is presented together with an iterative computational procedure. A dimensional set of equations is developed and solved by the Runge-Kutta method. It is shown that the Significant parameters of the combined two phase flow are the film thickness, the liquid flow rate, the collector length and inclination and the solar radiation. A small scale free flow flat plate solar still was designed and constructed, and experimental studies conducted under laboratory and direct solar conditions to investigate features which would seem to affect the still performance such as solar radiation, wind velocity, ambient air temperature, liquid flow rate and angle of inclination. Finally the theoretical and experimental results are combined {{together to form a}} basis for the design of a long, large solar still for further study...|$|R
