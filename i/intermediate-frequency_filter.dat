40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we examine}} a simple method {{to improve the}} {{performance}} of serial, matched-filter acquisition in direct-sequence spread-spectrum packet radio communications. Each packet transmission includes an acquisition preamble, and the preamble sequence is changed at the boundaries of predefined time epochs based on a pseudorandom sequence generator. It is shown in previous work {{that the presence of}} an <b>intermediate-frequency</b> <b>filter</b> and the characteristics of the automatic gain-control subsystem lead to a probability of not acquiring that is a nonmonotonic function of the signal-to-noise ratio if the acquisition algorithm uses a threshold-crossing detector with a fixed threshold. The acquisition algorithm presented in this paper employs an estimator to adaptively select the acquisition threshold for each test statistic. It is shown that this technique reduces the severity of the nonmonotonicity and substantially improves the acquisition performance.

40|$|Circuit {{boards that}} contain {{radio-frequency}} (RF) and digital circuitry {{have been developed}} by NASA to satisfy a requirement of the Port of Houston Authority for relatively inexpensive Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers that indicate the azimuthal headings {{as well as the}} positions of ships. The receiver design utilizes the unique architecture of the Mitel commercial chip-set, which provides for an accurate GPS-based heading-determination device. The major components include two RF front ends (each connected to a separate antenna), a surface-acoustic-wave <b>intermediate-frequency</b> <b>filter</b> between second- and third-stage mixers, a correlator, and a reduced-instruction- set computer. One of the RF front ends operates as a master, the other as a slave. Both RF front ends share a 10 -MHz sinusoidal clock oscillator, which provides for more accurate carrier phase measurements between the two antennas. The outputs of the RF front ends are subjected to conventional GPS processing. The commercial-based chip-set design approach provides an inexpensive open architecture GPS platform, which can be used in developing and implementing unique GPS-heading and attitude-determination algorithms for specific applications. The heading is estimated from the GPS position solutions of the two antennas by an algorithm developed specifically for this application. If a third (and preferably a fourth) antenna were added, {{it would be possible to}} estimate the attitude of the GPS receiver in three dimensions instead of only its heading in a horizontal plane...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{periodical}} nonuniform individual {{sampling scheme}} {{has been shown}} suitable for capacitance spread and total capacitor area reduction in high quality () factor switched-ca-pacitor (SC) filters. However, the use of periodical nonuniform clock signals results in additional aliasing components in the output spectrum. This paper presents a simple model to analyze the generation of such alias components and gives practical ex-pressions to estimate their power. The results are verified through circuit simulation of a 10. 7 -MHz second-order SC bandpass filter in a 0. 35 - m CMOS technology. Implications {{on the use of}} this technique in the design of <b>intermediate-frequency</b> <b>filters</b> are discussed.

40|$|Abstract—The {{measurement}} of a radar chirp waveform is crit-ical to assessing its spectral compliance. The Fourier transform for a linear frequency-modulated chirp is {{a sequence of}} frequency-domain impulse functions. Because a spectrum analyzer measures the waveform with a finite-bandwidth <b>intermediate-frequency</b> (IF) <b>filter,</b> the bandwidth of this filter {{is critical to the}} power level and shape of the reported spectrum. Measurement results are presented that show the effects of resolution bandwidth and frequency sam-pling interval on the measured spectrum and its reported shape. The objective of the measurement is to align the shape of the mea-sured spectrum with the true shape of the signal spectrum. This paper demonstrates an approach for choosing resolution band-width and frequency sampling interval settings using the example of a linear frequency-modulation (FM) chirp waveform.

40|$|A {{detailed}} theoretical analysis, {{based upon}} Rice's theory of clicks, {{for evaluating the}} error performance of heterodyne optical FSK receivers with limiter-discriminator detection and pre- and integrate-and-dump (I&D) post-detection filtering is developed, accounting for laser phase noise, intersymbol interference (ISI) and <b>intermediate-frequency</b> (IF) <b>filtered</b> carrier envelope fluctuation effects. From the analysis {{it turns out that}} the envelope fluctuations induced by phase noise may produce, for operating IF bandwidths, a much smoother transition to the bit error rate floor than expected when considering IF infinite bandwidth, thereby generating performance degradation right in the operating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. The contribution to this degradation due to a change in the click statistics generated by the envelope fluctuations is found to be negligible. From the analysis, it is also found that the floor gets lower and approached more rapidly as the modulation index and the bandwidth get larger, until the known floor for infinite IF bandwidth is reached. Finally, general curves are presented for system performance relating bit error probability to optimum IF bandwidth, optimum modulation index, laser linewidth and receiver sensitivity. These curves represent the ultimate limit to performance of a heterodyne optical FSK receiver with limiter-discriminator detection and pre- and I&D post-detection filtering...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Surface {{acoustic}} wave (SAW) filters {{have a wide}} range of applications, including, for example, in mobile/wireless transceivers, radio frequency (RF) filters, intermediate frequency (IF) filters, resonator-filters, filters for mobile and wireless circuits, IF filters in a base transceiver station (BTS), RF front-end filters for mobile/wireless circuitry, multimode frequency-agile oscillators for spread-spectrum secure communications, nyquist filters for microwave digital radio, voltage controlled oscillators for first or second stage mixing in mobile transceivers, delay lines for low power time-diversity wireless receivers, pseudo-noise-coded delay lines for combined code division multiple access/time division multiple access (CDMA/TDMA) access, clock recovery filters for fiber-optics communication repeater stages, synchronous, spread-spectrum communications, televisions, video recorders, and many other applications. SAW filters are also finding increasing use as picture-signal <b>intermediate-frequency</b> (PIF) <b>filters,</b> vestigial sideband (VSB) filters, and other types of communication filters, and as filters for digital signal processing [1]. It is, however, supported and lead by various technologies of public communication systems such as fiber optics, digital microwave and satellites.

On the other hand, employment of Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) technology to create radio front-ends facilitates reductions in size, weight, cost, and power in radio communications. Several research groups from academia and industry have recently demonstrated electrostatically and ferroelectrically transduced microelectromechanical resonators and filters that operate at high frequency and exhibit low insertion loss as potential substitutes for conventional quartz and ceramic devices. However, the modern radio architecture today also requires the ability to discern bandwidths between 0. 1 MHz and 5 MHz. This requires frequency-agile <b>intermediate-frequency</b> <b>filters,</b> generating a strong demand for narrow-bandwidth channel-select filters with very high quality factors (Q), which can be formed using high-Q MEMS resonators. This dissertation presents {{the state of the art}} transduction mechanisms of MEMS resonators and filters with key innovations in DC voltage tuning schemes, packaging technology and system integration. Electrically coupled, high-Q, tunable channel-select ladder filters comprised of dielectrically transduced thickness shear mode resonators are presented using integrated circuit compatible bulk micromachining technology. The ladder filter consists of shunt and series resonators operating in the half-wave thickness shear vibration mode. Each constituent resonator of the filter can be excited at above 810 MHz resonant frequency with Q of 7, 800 in air and a motional impedance (RX) of 59 Omega. The ladder filter demonstrates a center frequency tuning range of 8 MHz at 817 MHz and an adjustable bandwidth from 600 kHz to 2. 8 MHz, while maintaining an insertion loss less than 4 dB, stop-band rejection greater than 30 dB and pass-band ripple less than 2 dB. By having a tunability feature, radio frequency (RF) MEMS filters can accommodate various signal waveforms with bandwidth range of 0. 1 MHz and 5 MHz. In addition, errors due to fabrication can be compensated and capacitive loading in receiver architecture can be minimized. Multi-frequency and multi-band filters on-chip has motivated the design and fabrication of a center frequency and bandwidth tunable RF MEMS filter using a series-coupled array of dielectrically-transduced square-extensional contour mode resonators. The proposed digital tuning scheme provides channel-agility and bandwidth granularity for analog spectral processors and RF spectrum analyzers. A 512 MHz overtone square-extensional mode resonator is demonstrated with a Q of 1, 800 in air and RX of 3. 1 k-Omega. An array of four such resonators is coupled mechanically to form a channel-select filter with 1. 4 MHz bandwidth at 509 MHz center frequency. By switching the DC-biasing scheme, the filter is split into narrower high and low sub-bands, each 700 kHz wide. Despite of the advances in device performance, packaging technology for MEMS resonators and filters remains a critical challenge. Because of the extreme sensitivity to environment, MEMS resonators and filters need a good vacuum encapsulation technology. The promising on-chip applications also require a CMOS compatible packaging process. The first successful combination of a dielectricallytransduced 200 MHz width-extensional contour mode resonator with the epi-silicon encapsulation process is demonstrated. The fabricated encapsulated-resonator exhibits a resonant frequency of 207 MHz and a Q of 6, 400. The high f x Q(1. 2 x 10 exp(12) Hz) makes this encapsulated resonator an excellent candidate for applications in local oscillators for RF front-ends and frequency references. Dielectric transduction is not only limited to solid dielectric transduction. Lateral contour-mode resonators in which the transduction gaps are filled with a liquid dielectric having much higher permittivity than air are presented. Aqueous transduction is more efficient than air-gap transduction and has a higher frequency tuning range compared to solid dielectric transduction. A 42 MHz poly-SiGe disk resonator with de-ionized (DI) water confined to the electrode gaps is demonstrated. The resonator has a measured Q of 3, 800, RX of 3. 9 k-Omega and 3 % series frequency tuning range. Ferroelectric materials like lead zirconate titanate (PZT) is of interest because it offers a large electromechanical coupling coefficient (k sub(t) exp(2)) and electric field dependent permittivity and modulus of elasticity. In this effort, PZT transduced resonators with the same lateral dimensions are designed and fabricated with and without a silicon device layer to explore the insertion loss, linearity, tunability and Q trade-offs between the two types of resonators. A novel air-bridge fabrication technology is developed to minimize the pad capacitances and enables the frequency excitation of PZT transduced resonators above 1. 8 GHz. PZT transduced fully-differential filters are designed by mechanically coupling two high-overtone width-extensional mode resonators. The fully-differential filter configuration cancels the feed-through capacitance and improves the stop-band floor of the filter. The demonstrated electric field tuning provides channel-agility and bandwidth adjustability for incorporation of analog spectral processors in state of the art radio receiver architectures. The filter demonstrates a center frequency tuning range of 7 MHz at 260 MHz and an adjustable bandwidth from 3 MHz to 6. 3 MHz, while maintaining a maximum frequency shift due to hysteresis effects below 0. 14 % and a stop-band rejection floor of - 60 dB. In order to improve immunity to hysteresis and realize the narrow bandwidth channel-select filter, the PZT transduced fully-differential filters are integrated with silicon device layer. A 206. 3 MHz high-overtone width-extensional filter is demonstrated with 653 kHz bandwidth, - 25 dB insertion loss and - 62 dB stop-band rejection in air. Uncompensated temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) of - 16 ppm/degrees C and third-order input intercept point (IIP 3) of + 29 dBm are demonstrated by the filter. The monolithic integration of RF components has long been a goal of researchers and will enable not only more compact and lower cost systems but previously unachievable signal processing functions. This dissertation provides the first experimental demonstration of monolithically integrated piezoelectric RF MEMS switches with contour mode filters. PZT thin films are utilized to enable both low-voltage switch operation and filter tunability. This research leverages previous work using PZT actuators for low-voltage, wide-band switches and PZT transduced silicon resonators. The two device technologies are combined using a hybrid fabrication process that combines the key components of each device fabrication into a single unified process using silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates. The voltage tunable and switchable filter array provides a drop-in solution for frequency-agile channel selectivity required in tranceiver front-ends...|$|R
