40|$|An interneurone, the <b>S</b> <b>cell</b> in {{the central}} nervous system of the leech, regenerates its severed axon and forms an {{electrical}} synapse with its target, another <b>S</b> <b>cell,</b> entirely within the ensheathment of two glial cells. After the two glial cells were killed selectively by intracellular injection of protease, axonal regeneration and synapse formation occurred in a normal fashion during the month following nerve injury. Soon after reconnexion of <b>S</b> <b>cells,</b> the conduction of impulses across the non-rectifying electrical junction between the cells was more reliable from the target than into it from the thinner regenerating axon. The distal segments of severed S-cell axons survived for weeks or months after destruction of their glial cells, indicating that the ensheathing glia is not required for long-term survival of axon segments. The distal axon segment of the <b>S</b> <b>cell</b> remained connected to the target axon at the normal region of synapse midway between ganglia within the nerve cord. In about half the cases in which reconnexion between injured <b>S</b> <b>cell</b> and target <b>S</b> <b>cell</b> occurred between 10 and 25 days following nerve crush, the regenerating neurone had formed an electrical synapse with its severed distal axon and had thereby become reconnected, indirectly, with its target. In the other cases, reconnexion was by direct contact. By 4 weeks, the proportion of injured <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> that were coupled and making direct contact with their targets rose to more than 80 % of the total population, indicating that regeneration continued until the two <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> contacted one another directly. This is similar to the course of S-cell regeneration {{in the presence of the}} ensheathing glia. Microscopy of the regenerating neurone and both its distal axon segment and its target showed that the site of synapse formation in the absence of the usual glial sheath was normal. Fluorescence microscopy following intracellular injection of Lucifer Yellow dye, which crosses between <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> at the electrical synapse, showed that the regenerated synapse formed specifically between <b>S</b> <b>cells.</b> Moreover, the target did not form alternative synapses when regeneration failed...|$|R

There are two isoenzymes of Protox, {{one of which is}} located in the plastid and the other in the mitochondria. Sequence analysis of the cloned Protox cDNAs showed that the deduced amino acid sequences of plastidial and mitochondrial Protox in wild-type cells and in herbicide-resistant YZI- 1 <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> are the same. The level of plastidial Protox mRNA was the same in both wild-type and YZI- 1 <b>S</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas the level of mitochondrial Protox mRNA YZI- 1 <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> was up to 10 times the level of wild-type cells.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} schizandrin A on drug resistance of glioma stem/ progenitor cells (GSPCs) and its mechanism.   Methods Isolate and culture SHG- 44 <b>s</b> <b>cells</b> from human glioma cell line SHG- 44. The SHG- 44 <b>s</b> <b>cells</b> were treated with different concentrations of schizandrin A (0, 12. 50, 25. 00 and 50. 00 μmol/L) and vincristine (400, 800 and 1200 nmol/L). The cell proliferative activity was measured by cell counting kit- 8 (CCK- 8) assay. Rhodamine 123 staining was used to detect the drug delivery ability of SHG - 44 <b>s</b> <b>cells.</b> The transcription and translation ability of ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB 1) gene of SHG- 44 <b>s</b> <b>cells</b> was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting.   Results The proliferative activity of SHG- 44 <b>s</b> <b>cells</b> was inhibited when the concentration of schizandrin A was 50 μmol/L (P = 0. 001, 0. 001, 0. 039), so this concentration was removed in the follow-up study. No matter the concentration of vincristine was 400, 800 or 1200 nmol/L, combining with schizandrin A could inhibit the proliferative activity of SHG - 44 <b>s</b> <b>cells</b> (vincristine 400 nmol/L: P = 0. 007, 0. 001; vincristine 800 nmol/L: P = 0. 001, 0. 000; vincristine 1200 nmol/L: P = 0. 000, 0. 000). Inverted fluorescence microscopy findings showed SHG - 44 <b>s</b> <b>cells</b> {{in the group of}} schizandrin A 0 μ mol/L rarely revealed green fluorescence, while SHG- 44 <b>s</b> <b>cells</b> in the groups of schizandrin A 12. 50 and 25. 00 μmol/L presented obvious green fluorescence. Flow cytometry showed that with the increasing of schizandrin A concentration, the percentage of positive cells by Rhodamine 123 staining was 10. 40 %, 39. 20 % and 45. 20 %, respectively. Real - time PCR showed that ABCB 1 gene expression levels of SHG - 44 <b>s</b> <b>cells</b> in schizandrin A 12. 50 μ mol/L group and 25. 00 μ mol/L group were significantly decreased comparing with schizandrin A 0 μ mol/L group (P = 0. 027, 0. 006), especially in schizandrin A 25. 00 μ mol/L group (P = 0. 034). Western blotting showed that the expression level of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in SHG- 44 <b>s</b> <b>cells</b> was gradually decreased with the increasing of schizandrin A concentration.   Conclusions Schizandrin A can inhibit the drug delivery ability of P-gp coded by ABCB 1 gene existing in the surface of GSPCs. It can further reverse the drug resistance of GSPCs by reducing the transcription and translation of ABCB 1 gene.   DOI: 10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2017. 06. 009 </p...|$|R

40|$|The mature {{striatum}} {{is divided}} into a labyrinthine system of striosomes embedded in a surrounding matrix compartment. We pulse-labeled striosomal <b>cells</b> (<b>S</b> <b>cells)</b> and matrix cells (M cells) in cats with [superscript 3]H-thymidine and followed their distributions during fetal and postnatal development. We identified three maturational phases in S-cell distributions. The early phase (sampled at embryonic day [E] 27 –E 35 following E 24 -E 28 [superscript 3]H-thymidine) was characterized by a transient medial accumulation of synchronously generated <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> within the caudate nucleus adjoining the ganglionic eminence, potentially a waiting compartment. Band-like arrangements of synchronously generated <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> then formed beyond this medial band. During the second phase (sampled at E 38 –E 45), the loosely banded S-cell distributions were transformed into clustered arrangements typical of developing striosomes. In the third phase (sampled from E 52 into the postnatal period), these developed into the typical mature striosomal architecture. At adulthood, gentle mediolateral birthdate-gradients in <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> were still evident, but M cells, produced over mid to late prenatal ages, became broadly distributed, without apparent gradients or banding arrangements. These {{findings suggest that the}} maturational histories of the striosomal and matrix neurons are influenced by their generation times and local environments, and that future <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> have transient, nonstriosomal distributions prior to their aggregation into striosomal clusters, including a putative waiting compartment. Further, the eventual patterning of the striosomal compartment reflects outside-in, band-like gradient patterns of settling of synchronously generated <b>S</b> <b>cells,</b> patterns that could be related both to neural processing in the mature striatum and to patterns of vulnerability of striatal neurons.

40|$|Although TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) usually induces {{cell death}} in tumor cells, {{there are some}} tumor cell types that are {{resistant}} to its apoptogenic effects. Some chemotherapeutic drugs, however, can sensitize resistant cancer cells to TRAIL by either upregulating surface TRAIL death receptor expression or by modulating intracellular signalling pathways emanating from TRAIL receptors. U 2 OS human osteosarcoma cells express TRAIL-R 2 but are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. However, the genotoxic drugs, Doxorubicin and Cisplatin, are able to sensitize U 20 <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> to TRAIL, without affecting their surface expression of either death or decoy TRAIL receptors.

A total of eighty-three neurones were filled using electrodes containing a 5 % solution of the dye. Forty-six cells had many short processes and a single long process (Dogiel type 1) and twenty-four cells had essentially smooth somas and one to eight long processes (Dogiel type II). Thirteen cells could not be put into either group. Enkephalin-like immunoreactivity was detected in twenty-two of the forty-six Dogiel type I cells. Eighteen of these had club-like short processes. No other cells of the eighty-three showed enkephalin-like immunoreactivity. Electrodes filled with a 0. 5 % solution of Lucifer Yellow in 0. 5 M-KCl were used to record from and simultaneously to inject dye into 240 neurones. Eighty-six nerve cells had a slow after-hyperpolarization following the action potential (AH cells) and forty-six nerve cells had no after-hyperpolarization but exhibited a fast excitatory synaptic potential (<b>S</b> <b>cells).</b> The other cells could not be unequivocally identified by their observed electrophysiological characteristics.

40|$|The high {{mortality}} {{of colon cancer}} is {{to a large extent}} caused by the frequent occurrence of liver metastasis. This is remarkable, because the liver harbors two distinct cell populations that can eliminate invading cancer cells, namely hepatic natural killer (NK) cells and Kupffer cells. These hepatic NK cells, known as pit cells, are the most cytotoxic cells of the naturally occurring NK cells. However, the mechanism by which pit cells eliminate tumor cells is largely unknown. Because we recently found an indication that apoptosis is involved, we tried to assess the role of this mode of cell death using an in vitro system with isolated pure pit cells (> 90 %) and CC 531 <b>s</b> <b>cells,</b> a rat colon carcinoma (CC) cell line. Pit cells induced apoptosis in CC 531 <b>s</b> <b>cells</b> as shown by quantitative DNA fragmentation, agarose gel electrophoresis, and different modes of microscopy. When extracellular Ca 2 + was chelated by ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) -N,N,-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) during coincubation or when the pit cells were preincubated with the granzyme inhibitor 3, 4 -dichloroisocoumarin (DCI), the induction of apoptosis was abolished. These results show that pit cells use the Ca 2 +-dependent perforin/granzyme pathway to induce apoptosis in the CC 531 <b>s</b> <b>cells,</b> and not the alternative Ca 2 +-independent Fas pathway. To further exclude the possibility of the involvement of the Fas pathway, we treated CC 531 <b>s</b> <b>cells</b> with recombinant Fas ligand. This treatment did not result in the induction of apoptosis, indicating that CC 531 <b>s</b> <b>cells</b> are resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis.

Two human breast cancer cell lines were studied; one is MDA-MB- 435 <b>S</b> <b>cell,</b> and the other T- 47 D cell. The expression of the folic acid receptors of the former {{is much higher than}} that of the latter. These cells were incubated with media containing bare GNPs or GNPs conjugated with folic acid individually. Due to the unique optical behavior (i. e. surface plasmon resonance) of GNPs, the uptake amount of GNPs by cells can be identified by using the laser scanning confocal microscopy. Our experiments show that the uptake amount of GNPs in MDAMB- 435 <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> is higher than that in T- 47 D cells for the same culture time, if the culture medium contains bare GNPs. Moreover, if the GNPs conjugated with folic acid are used for the culture, the uptake rate of GNPs by MDA-MB- 435 <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> is improved more. In contrast, the uptake rates of both GNPs are almost the same by T- 47 D cells. The phenomenon indicates that the uptake rate of GNPs can be improved via the ligand-receptor endocytosis, compared with the nonspecific endocytosis. Therefore, the uptake rate of GNPs conjugated with folic acid by MDA-MB- 435 <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> is higher than that of bare GNPs...|$|R

Therefore, establishment of baculovirus infection conditions is the first important step and this should be properly optimized for production yield. We used statistical methodology to optimize the baculovirus infection conditions using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter protein.

50|$|<b>S</b> <b>cells</b> are cells which release secretin, {{found in}} the jejunum and duodenum. They are stimulated by a drop in pH to 4 or below in the small intestine's lumen. The {{released}} secretin will increase the secretion of bicarbonate (HCO3−) into the lumen, via the pancreas. This is primarily accomplished {{by an increase in}} cyclic AMP that activates CFTR to release chloride anions into the lumen. The luminal Cl− is then involved in a bicarbonate transporter protein exchange, in which the chloride is reabsorbed by the cell and HCO3− is secreted into the lumen. <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> are also one of the main producers of cyclosamatin.|$|R
40|$|The {{murine leukemia}} cell line L 1210 S and a subline, L 1210 R, are {{sensitive}} and resistant to (alpha) /(beta) -interferon respectively. The L 1210 R cells {{are thought to}} differ from the L 1210 S in only two properties: (1) they lack the high affinity binding sites (receptors) present for (alpha) /(beta) -interferon on the L 1210 S, and (2) they are {{more sensitive to the}} cytotoxicity of, and bind more of a carbohydrate binding protein from Phaseolus vulgaris (PHA-L) than the L 1210 <b>S</b> <b>cells.</b> Both of these differences are hypothesized {{to be related to the}} same difference in carbohydrate structure(s) present in the L 1210 R and L 1210 <b>S</b> <b>cell</b> lines. Here the role of carbohydrate in the response of L 1210 S and L 1210 R cells to (alpha) /(beta) -interferon and PHA-L is examined. It was found that the L 1210 <b>S</b> <b>cell</b> line is less sensitive to PHA-L due to a subpopulation that is completely resistant to PHA-L, although the majority of the L 1210 <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> are as sensitive to PHA-L as are the L 1210 R cells. Furthermore, it is the presence of the ASN-linked oligosaccharides that accounts for the sensitivity of L 1210 S and L 1210 R cells to PHA-L. Indeed, the entire group of ASN-linked complex type oligosaccharides which includes the PHA-L specific oligiosaccharides can be absent from the L 1210 <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> without effect on their response to (alpha) /(beta) -interferon. This was shown by growing the L 1210 <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> in the presence of swainsonine, a compound which prevents normal processing of the precursor high-mannose type into the complex type of ASN-linked oligosaccharides. Growth in the presence of swainsonine ablated the toxicity of PHA-L and prevented the biosynthesis of the ASN-linked oligosaccharides, but response to (alpha) /(beta) -interferon remained normal. These results significantly indicate that the entire group of complex type ASN-linked oligosaccharides, including those that bind as well as those that do not bind to PHA-L, does not contain the carbohydrate structure(s) which is involved in the mechanism of action of (alpha) /(beta) -interferon. In addition, another polypeptide with hormone-like action, interleukin 2 (T cell growth factor) was found to bind to gangliosides, sialic acid containing glycolipids which are present at the cell surface and perhaps this binding is normally involved in the response of T cells to this molecule...|$|R
40|$|The IL- 1 R {{accessory}} protein (IL- 1 RAcP) {{plays a role}} in IL- 1 R signaling {{by forming}} a complex with IL- 1 RI bound to the IL- 1 ligand. We identified four hydrophilic peptide regions of the extracellular IL- 1 RAcP that may be available for complex formation (peptide 1, 71 - 83 domain Ipeptide 2, 204 - 211 domain IIpeptide 3, 282 - 292 domain IIIand peptide 4, 304 - 314 domain III). These peptides were synthesized, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to produce rabbit antisera. Each affinity-purified antiserum showed specificity for the respective peptide without cross-reacivity. Anti-peptide 2, 3, and 4 recognized surface expression of IL- 1 RAcP on the Th 2 D 10 <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> by FACS and inhibited IL- 1 driven proliferation. Anti-peptide 4 recognized intact IL- 1 RAcP and soluble IL- 1 RAcP. Anti-IL- 1 RAcP-peptide 4, which targets the terminal segment of domain III, inhibited 80 % of IL- 1 β-driven proliferations of D 10 <b>S</b> <b>cells.</b> However, these IL- 1 RAcP Abs had no effect on the activity of human or mouse IL- 1 α. Whereas IL- 1 β down-regulated IL- 1 RI surface expression (p < 0. 05), there was no change in the surface expression of IL- 1 RAcP. Moreover, murine IL- 10 increased surface expression of IL- 1 RI, but did not affect expression of IL- 1 RAcP or the proliferation of D 10 <b>S</b> <b>cells.</b> Steady state levels of mRNA for IL- 1 RAcP and IL- 1 RI in D 10 <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> showed a similar pattern to that of surface expression of the respective receptors. We conclude that 1) blocking IL- 1 RAcP inhibits IL- 1 signaling in D 10 <b>S</b> <b>cells,</b> 2) domains-II and III may be involved in complex formation with IL- 1 RI, 3) IL- 1 RAcP is not regulated as is IL- 1 RI in the same cells, and 4) IL- 1 responsiveness is dependent on the expression of IL- 1 RI, not IL- 1 RAcP. ope...|$|R

Cell deformability was evaluated by pipette aspiration. Tested at the same aspiration pressures, <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> {{were found to be}} less deformable than G 1 cells. Moreover, HL- 60 cells exhibited power-law fluid behavior: mu = mu c(gamma m/ gamma c) -b, where mu is cytoplasmic viscosity, gamma m is mean shear rate, mu c is the characteristic viscosity at the characteristic shear rate gamma c, and b is a material constant. At a given shear rate, <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> (mu c = 276 +/- 14 Pa. s, b = 0. 51 +/- 0. 03) were more viscous than G 1 cells (mu c = 197 +/- 25, b = 0. 53 +/- 0. 02). To evaluate the relative importance of different cytoskeletal components in these cell cycle-dependent properties, HL- 60 cells were treated with 30 microM dihydrocytochalasin B (DHB) to disrupt F-actin or 100 microM colchicine to collapse microtubules. DHB dramatically softened both G 1 and <b>S</b> <b>cells,</b> which reduced the material constants mu c by approximately 65 % and b by 20 - 30 %. Colchicine had a limited effect on G 1 cells but significantly reduced mu c of <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> (approximately 25 %).

Methods: Cytotoxicity was measured in terms of inhibition of cell growth, activation of apoptosis, release of nitric oxide (NO), detection of tissue transglutaminase (TG II) and alteration of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) on Caco- 2 /Tc 7 and K 562 (<b>S)</b> <b>cell</b> agglutination. Peptic-tryptic (PT) digest from bread wheat (T. aestivum S. Pastore) was used as a positive control.

In contrast to YAC- 1 cells as NK targets, perforin-based cytotoxicity was not highly associated with WEHI 164 S killing.

The {{leading edge of}} the migrating disc epithelia consists of two groups of <b>cells,</b> stalk <b>cells</b> (<b>S</b> <b>cells)</b> and specialized imaginal cells (I cells), that both express the gene puckered. With this and other markers, opening of the stalk, eversion of the discs, migration of the leading edges, and fusion of the imaginal epithelia can be visualized in detail. Fusion is initiated by <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> that migrate over the larval epithelium and constitute a bridge between two imaginal epithelia. <b>S</b> <b>cells</b> are subsequently lost and imaginal fusion is mediated by the I cells that remain at the site of fusion. The possible cellular basis of this process is discussed.
