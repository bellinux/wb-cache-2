60|$|When {{they reached}} the house the cattle went {{straight}} through the yard, toward the barn. Beechnut and Stuyvesant followed them. Beechnut {{was going to get}} them some hay. Stuyvesant went in with Beechnut and stood below on the barn floor, while Beechnut went up the ladder to pitch the <b>hay</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R

He had just pulled his bed of <b>hay</b> <b>down</b> over him, and was trying to curl himself up so as to stop his teeth from chattering, with Caesar on his feet, when the dog growled, and a great voice lowered to a gruff whisper, said, 'Come along, young un!' ...|$|R
60|$|After {{pitching}} the <b>hay</b> <b>down</b> {{a little}} while, Rollo descended, {{though it was}} not necessary for Jonas to help him, for he jumped down upon the heap of hay which he had made. They then went together, attending to Jonas's work about the barn, while Rollo stopped occasionally to look out the open door or window, where the sun was shining in very pleasantly. Rollo began to think it was a warm, pleasant morning.|$|R
60|$|In a {{short time}} Beechnut came back, {{bringing}} his arms full of hay. He walked directly toward {{that part of the}} field where the hornet's nest was, calling Stuyvesant to follow him. Stuyvesant did so. When he got near to the stump, he put the <b>hay</b> <b>down</b> upon the ground. He then advanced cautiously to the stump with a part of the hay in his arms This <b>hay</b> he put <b>down</b> {{at the foot of the}} stump, directly under the hornet's nest, extending a portion of it outward so as to form a sort of train. He then went back and took up the remaining portion of the hay and held it in his hands.|$|R

A later [...] "English hay-tedder" [...] uses two separate cylinders with rotating forks that can be reversed to lay the <b>hay</b> <b>down</b> lightly for improved exposure to air.|$|R

50|$|Noreen Hay (born 10 March 1951) is an Australian {{politician}} {{and a former}} member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. She represented Wollongong for the Australian Labor Party from 2003 to 2016. In July 2015, <b>Hay</b> stood <b>down</b> as NSW Opposition whip due to allegations of electoral fraud and branch stacking.|$|R
50|$|Until very recently, {{the fort}} {{was covered with}} gorse bushes. This plant has {{invasive}} roots, and scientists were worried {{that it might be}} damaging the remains of Trawscoed Fort. A group from FC Wales removed the gorse, and foresters laid <b>down</b> <b>hay</b> from the nearby Penrhyncoch meadow. The seeds contained in the <b>hay</b> will fall <b>down</b> and germinate, thus replacing the gorse with a layer of grass. This will have the added benefit of attracting birds and butterflies to the site.|$|R
50|$|The {{process may}} begin with {{microbiological}} activity (bacteria or mold), {{but at some}} point, the process has to become chemical. Microbiological activity will also {{limit the amount of}} oxygen available in the hay. Moisture appears to be quite important, no matter what process. At 100 °C, wet hay absorbed twice the amount of oxygen of dry hay. There has been conjecture that the complex carbohydrates present in <b>hay</b> break <b>down</b> to simpler sugars, which are more readily oxidized.|$|R
60|$|The tension only {{lasted a}} moment or two. A man sprang up on the pole of the wagon, and a truss of <b>hay</b> went <b>down.</b> Another followed, and then, men who had also felt the strain and now felt it a relief to do anything, {{clustered}} about the wagon. In a few minutes it was empty, {{and the men who}} had been a mob turned to the one who had changed them into an organized body.|$|R

I was walking down it too, that morning, and I overtook Hay and asked him what the trouble was. He turned a lustreless eye upon me and said: ...|$|R
5000|$|Once the tedding {{process had}} finished, the hay {{was made into}} a ruck. In Boho, {{depending}} on the moisture of the ground, it was traditional to place some branches on the ground or old hay to stop the bottom of the new ruck getting wet. The ruck was constructed by two or three people pitching up hay to a person on top of the ruck (sometimes a child) who tramped the <b>hay</b> <b>down</b> so that it was compact. When the ruck was high enough, usually the height of the person pitching the hay plus the length of their pitchfork, somebody would pull out the bottom circumference of the ruck and pitch that hay up on top as well. Two hay ropes made with a twister were usually thrown {{over the top of the}} ruck at right angles to each other and secured by pulling out a piece of hay at the bottom of the ruck and making another short attachment, so that the ropes and the bottom of the ruck could be connected. After this was done, the ruck would be [...] "dressed" [...] by raking down the outside so that water would run off the top during the rain. The surrounding ground was raked for hay, which was transferred over to the next ruck.|$|R
50|$|In 1952, to pay {{the death}} duties of his father, Henry Charles Hovell-Thurlow-Cumming-Bruce, 7th Baron Thurlow sold the estate, {{possibly}} to Henry Lyons (created Lord Ennisdale), who died in 1963. With the house Grade II listed in 1960, it was then bought in 1965 by helicopter entrepreneur Alan Bristow for over £300,000. In 1979, the house, which had been unoccupied for 11 years and was {{being used as a}} barn to store <b>hay,</b> burnt <b>down</b> in suspicious circumstances, after planning permission had been refused for alterations submitted earlier that year.|$|R

60|$|He {{strained}} {{his eyes}} in the direction, {{and after a few}} moments caught sight of an immense <b>hay</b> barge bearing <b>down</b> upon him. The hay barge had been towed by a steam tug, but the rope had parted, and the barge was now drifting {{at the mercy of the}} wind and current.|$|R

50|$|Connecticut farmers {{suffered}} severe drought conditions between August 1964 and November 1967, While some harvests of higher-value crops like shade tobacco {{were saved}} due to irrigation, in Fairfield County some 125 dairy farms lost 80% of their pasture grass, with wells on 30% of those farms failing by November that year. Statewide, pasture and <b>hay</b> yields were <b>down</b> 40% for dairy farmers.|$|R
50|$|For {{nearly three}} years, studios {{complied}} with the Code. By 1938, however, as {{the threat of war}} in Europe loomed, movie producers began to worry about the possibility of decreased profits abroad. This led to a decreased investment in following the strictures of the code, and occasional refusals to comply with PCA demands. That same year, responding to trends in European films {{in the run-up to the}} war, Postmaster General Hays spoke out against using movies as a vehicle for propaganda. In 1945, after 24 years as president, <b>Hays</b> stepped <b>down</b> from his position at the MPPDA, although he continued to act as an advisor for the Association for the next five years.|$|R
50|$|During {{the mission}} <b>Hay</b> shot <b>down</b> another two {{aircraft}} himself; a Nakajima Ki-43 and a Nakajima Ki-44. At {{the end of}} January Hay's wing was again involved in operations to destroy the Sumatran oilfields. Hay claimed another victory on 29 January, when acting as the strike co-ordinator he shared in shooting down a Nakajima Ki-43 and a Nakajima Ki-44. Hay's wing was next involved in operations at the Sakishima Islands between March and June 1945, {{in support of the}} American invasion of Okinawa. Hay was awarded a Bar to his DSC for his service leading these attacks. At the end of the Second World War Hay, still on board Victorious, was involved in air strikes against the Japanese mainland until 11 August 1945 when Victorious was withdrawn to Sydney for a refit.|$|R
5000|$|North Otago put {{together}} their best performance {{so far this}} season with a comfortable win over Wararapa-Bush in Oamaru. North Otago led 10-7 at half-time, {{but it was an}} exciting second half that saw North Otago's lead extended. 8 minutes into the second half Ross <b>Hay</b> charged <b>down</b> Cash Lafaele's clearing kick, gathering the ball up on the bounce to cross the line. North Otago held the led throughout the second half despite a late charge from Wairarapa-Bush. Lemi Masoe was at his best, scoring two tries, while Pale Tuilagi proved his worth by not missing a kick all game.

60|$|The visitor found {{a seat in}} {{the prairie}} <b>hay,</b> and sinking <b>down</b> in the soft grass, she breathed the smell of wild {{peppermint}} with delight. She noticed the hearth of parallel logs, with a big kerosene can, used as a washing boiler, hanging from a tripod at one end; the camp oven; the sawing frame; and the scented cedar shingles strewn about beside the framework of the house. All these things were familiar, for {{she was one of the}} pioneers.|$|R
5000|$|The Divinity School at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina {{is one of}} ten {{graduate}} {{or professional}} schools within Duke University. It {{is also one of}} thirteen seminaries founded and supported by the United Methodist Church. It has 39 full-time and 18 part-time faculty and over 500 full-time students. The current dean of The Divinity School is Elaine Heath, who assumed the deanship on July 1, 2016. Former deans include the prominent New Testament scholar Richard B. <b>Hays</b> who stepped <b>down</b> in 2015, and L. Gregory Jones.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hays</b> went <b>down</b> {{with the}} RMS Titanic in April 1912; nevertheless, {{construction}} on the SNE commenced at full speed in May. However, all work stopped in November 1912, ostensibly due to an inability of worldwide bond markets to finance further GT expansion, although pressure from the New Haven, at the time closely allied with financier J. Pierpont Morgan, was widely suspected. Construction soon resumed in Massachusetts so that contractor John Marsch, who threatened litigation against the GT for breach of contract, could be paid for the work. However, construction in Rhode Island, being the responsibility of a different contractor, did not restart. Thus, by 1916, almost all the grading and concrete work in Massachusetts was completed, although no steelwork other than on highway overpasses was ever erected. World War I was seen as only a temporary financial setback to construction, which, however, never resumed.|$|R
50|$|In 1966, Hays ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic gubernatorial {{nomination}} in Arkansas. It was a crowded field of eight candidates, following 12 years of control by Governor Orval Faubus, who was stepping <b>down.</b> <b>Hays</b> finished third, {{ahead of the}} man who had defeated him as a write-in candidate in 1958, Dale Alford, but behind Frank Holt and Justice Jim Johnson. The eventual party nominee, James D. Johnson, a former Arkansas Supreme Court justice from Conway, and an avowed segregationist, was defeated in the November general election by the Republican Winthrop Rockefeller of Morrilton.|$|R

Further <b>down</b> the road they find their chum, Jack Dodd, and his father being questioned by the police because a stolen car was found in their yard with Jack's fishing rod in the back seat.

5000|$|Suspicion {{immediately}} fell on Phelan. Hays was, unlike Phelan, {{well liked}} by local soldiers and neighbors. Most {{of his neighbors}} were convinced of his guilt. Justice of the Peace, Henry Hastings Sibley, issued a warrant and Phelan was held at Fort Snelling under charges {{of murder in the}} first degree. On September 29, 1839, Phelan was arrested for the murder.When the next steam boat arrived, Phelan was sent down to Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin Territory which was the county that the crime was committed in. This was shown in the testimony given against him in his trial. One woman testified at his trial and said that when she asked him how he and Hays got along he said [...] "Very badly" [...] but said [...] "I'll soon get rid of him." [...] Another said he found blood on Phelan and bloody clothes in his house. He went on to state that his dog was able to find the route that Phelan had dragged <b>Hays</b> body <b>down</b> to the river.|$|R

She added he had [...] "banged about wanting to be a good boyfriend and dad for aeons" [...] and being the victim of domestic violence was ironic for him. She later said the serial was brave for tackling gay domestic violence. She opined that Richardson gave an [...] "incredible performance" [...] and felt she was not alone in perceiving the storyline to be [...] "deeply disturbing" [...] and [...] "deeply moving". She later expressed her view that [...] "Ste hasn’t experienced much normality in his young life". She concluded that Ste never seemed to have a trouble free day. The Liverpool Daily Post said [...] "You know you're not flavour of the month when even Ste <b>Hay</b> looks <b>down</b> his nose at you." ...|$|R
