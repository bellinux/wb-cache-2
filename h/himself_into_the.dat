To draw crowds, Jones needed a religious headliner, so he arranged to share the pulpit with Branham.|$|E

5|$|After his discharge, Robinson briefly {{returned}} to his old football club, the Los Angeles Bulldogs. Robinson then accepted an offer from his old friend and pastor Rev. Karl Downs to be the athletic director at Sam Huston College in Austin, then of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. The job included coaching the school's basketball team for the 1944–45 season. As it was a fledgling program, few students tried out for the basketball team, and Robinson even resorted to inserting <b>himself</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lineup for exhibition games. Although his teams were outmatched by opponents, Robinson was respected as a disciplinarian coach, and drew the admiration of, among others, Langston University basketball player Marques Haynes, a future member of the Harlem Globetrotters.|$|E

Unaware that the power is active, Mayor Quimby straps <b>himself</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> electric chair in a publicity attempt. Ralph then tells Bart that Lisa can probably {{figure out a way to}} warn the Mayor. She decides to launch a model rocket with a warning message attached and aims it toward the penitentiary. However, the rocket is blown off-course and crashes through Mr. Burns' office window. Mr. Burns reads the note and disables the penitentiary's power. In the aftermath, the Simpsons congratulate Ralph, for pointing out that Lisa could solve the problem.|$|E

5|$|Baker's last {{published}} work, Right Wing, {{as well as}} his posthumous novels Testosterone and Anarchy, {{represent a}} stylistic departure in that he inserts <b>himself</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> plot as either a secondary character or the protagonist. The latter two were edited, {{and in the case of}} Anarchy, partially rewritten by his editor, Scott Brassart. Testosterone needed only minor changes, while Anarchy underwent an entire rewrite, with Brassart restructuring the plot and streamlining over 500 pages of prose and notes into a fast-paced, 250 page novel. For the reader, however, it is only Baker's voice as writer that is heard.|$|E

He made {{a living as a}} teacher; but then renounced the social, urban life of the literary circles and was inclined to wander throughout the country, heading west, east, and far into the northern wilderness to gain inspiration for his writing. His poems were influenced by his firsthand experience of the world around him, often encapsulating the feeling of a scene in a few simple elements.|$|E

After receiving some not-so-helpful {{advice from}} her coworkers—especially Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Darryl, {{who is now}} assistant regional manager—Clark invites Erin to his apartment for the fake audition. However, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), who has come to dislike Clark, invites himself and Andy along under the pretense of helping with the audition, ruining Clark's seduction plan. Andy ends up throwing <b>himself</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fake plan and more or less dismissing Erin, who in turns goes out for dinner with Pete {{and appears to be}} enjoying time spent with him.|$|E

5|$|Davies threw <b>himself</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> role, {{travelling}} {{around the}} country and inspecting local units to gain an overall idea of their efficiency. Even under favourable circumstances, however, he found that only 54% of the volunteers attended parades in 1906; at the annual camps, the proportion was as low as 45%. He pressed for greater use of active day-time tactical training rather than evening indoors drill, which he felt was key for a part-time volunteer force, and for a greater emphasis on the training and standards of officers. By the end of his second year in office, he had organised local selection boards for appointing officers, and a central promotion board for senior field officers, as well as mandatory regular fitness and efficiency tests.|$|E

Gemma had designed some of the mathematical instruments used in these studies and Mercator soon become adept in the skills of their manufacture: practical skills of working in brass, mathematical skills for calculation of scales and engraving skills to produce the finished work.|$|E
