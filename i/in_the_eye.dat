5|$|Traces {{of onions}} {{recovered}} from Bronze Age settlements in China suggest that onions {{were used as}} far back as 5000 BCE, not only for their flavour, but the bulb's durability to store and transport.

5|$|Another {{leading cause}} of {{blindness}} is Canine glaucoma. This {{is an increase in}} the pressure of the fluid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> which, if left untreated, can cause visual impairment and eventual loss of sight. The condition can be inherited (Primary glaucoma) or a secondary condition to a variety of other eye issues including tumors or lens luxation. Both breeds are affected by juvenile cataracts which can occur at up to four years of age. Symptoms can include discoloring of the pupil, and treatment may include surgery to remove the cataract.|$|E
5|$|Freshly cut onions often cause a {{stinging}} sensation {{in the eyes}} of people nearby, and often uncontrollable tears. This is caused by the release of a volatile gas, syn-propanethial-S-oxide, which stimulates nerves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> creating {{a stinging}} sensation. This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism: chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases. These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids. A specific sulfenic acid, 1-propenesulfenic acid, is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme, the lacrimatory factor synthase, producing the syn-propanethial-S-oxide. This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes, where it activates sensory neurons. Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant.|$|E
5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} can be {{dangerous}} if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an electric arc, welders wear protective clothing, including heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. In addition, {{the brightness of the}} electric arc is a source of the condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of the cornea caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged exposure, possible burning of the retina <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darken upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{living in}} large groups may be safer from attack because the {{predator}} may be {{confused by the}} large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues {{as an example of}} this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of the predator.|$|E

5|$|Most lemurs have {{retained}} the tapetum lucidum, a reflective layer of tissue <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> which {{is found in}} many vertebrates. This trait is absent in haplorrhine primates, and its presence further limits the visual acuity in lemurs. The strepsirrhine choroidal tapetum is unique among mammals because it {{is made up of}} crystalline riboflavin, and the resulting optical scattering is what limits visual acuity. Although the tapetum is considered to be ubiquitous in lemurs, there appear to be exceptions among true lemurs, such as the black lemur and the common brown lemur, as well as the ruffed lemurs. Since the riboflavins in the tapetum have a tendency to dissolve and vanish when processed for histological investigation, however, the exceptions are still debatable.|$|E
