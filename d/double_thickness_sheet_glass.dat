After 10  min of ultrasonic solving, the autoclave was sealed and autoclaving was conducted at 180  °C for 2  h in an electric oven to produce TiO 2 -NRA.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Total {{emissivity}} of <b>glass</b> <b>sheets</b> {{varies with}} <b>sheet</b> <b>thickness</b> since <b>glass</b> is a semitransparent material. The total hemispherical emissivity, eh, of fused-silica and soda-lime <b>glass</b> <b>sheets</b> of different <b>thicknesses</b> {{was measured by}} a transient calorimetric technique previously proposed. The measured eh values are arranged together with those of borosilicate <b>glass</b> <b>sheets</b> reported in our previous work. The eh values obtained for various sheets are expressed as functions of <b>sheet</b> <b>thickness</b> and temperature. Further, the eh values are compared with other published data obtained by experiments and theory, and discussed. An edge effect caused by the temperature distribution on the specimen surface, is clarified and the error involved in the eh values measured by the transient calorimetric technique, is estimated. In addition, another edge effect caused by the distribution on the local total hemispherical emissivity on the specimen surface is made clear. ...|$|R
30|$|ZnO films (active area 0.28 cm 2) {{of various}} {{thicknesses}} (14 to 35 μm) were deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates (8 to 10 Ω/□, 3 mm in <b>thickness,</b> Nippon <b>Sheet</b> <b>Glass</b> Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) by screen printing. Screen-printable ZnO paste was prepared by dispersing commercially available ZnO nanoparticles (UniRegion Bio-Tech, Taiwan) in an equal proportion of α-terpineol (Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and ethyl cellulose. Before dye adsorption, the ZnO films were sintered at 400 °C for 1 h {{to remove any}} organic material in the paste. This thermal treatment sintered the nanoparticles together to form an interconnecting network. Dye sensitization was achieved by immersing the sintered ZnO films in a 0.5 mM solution of cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2, 2 ′-bipyridyl- 4, 4 ′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N 719, Solaronix; Solaronix SA, Aubonne, Switzerland). The solvent used to prepare the dye solution consisted of equal parts of acetonitrile and tert-butanol. Dye sensitization was performed at room temperature, and the adsorption time varied from 0.5 to 4.5 h. The electrodes loaded with the N 719 dye were then washed with acetonitrile and dried in air. Platinum (Pt)-coated FTO <b>glass</b> (Nippon <b>Sheet</b> <b>Glass,</b> 8 – 10 Ω/□, 3 mm in thickness) served as the counter electrode, which was prepared by placing a drop of H 2 PtCl 6 solution on an FTO glass and subsequently sintering the glass at 400 °C for 20 min. The ZnO photoanode and the counter electrode were sealed together with a 60 -μm-thick hot-melting spacer (Surlyn, DuPont, Wilmington, DE, USA), and the inner space {{was filled with a}} volatile electrolyte. The electrolyte was composed of 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.6 M 1, 2 -dimethyl- 3 -propylimid-azolium iodide (PMII, Merk Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan), 0.05 M I 2 (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (Sigma-Aldrich) in acetonitrile.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to determine deflections of fiber glass leaf spring depending on these parameters: form of the leaf spring, number of leafs in spring and contact between spring leafs (comparing springs with lubricated and non-lubricated leaf surfaces). Primarily, the mechanical properties and surface friction coefficient of the fiber glass was measured to get enough information about material used for the study. According selected leaf spring geometry, samples of fiber glass leaf springs were made. Stiffness of these samples was determined during bending tests. Finite element method and analytical formulas was also used to evaluate accuracy of experimental results. Experimentally found, that leaf springs with less uneven form has a greater stiffness. Also found that twice reduced number of leaf spring <b>sheets</b> (and <b>doubled</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>thickness)</b> resulted from 2, 86 to 3, 44 times greater leaf spring stiffness.

A novel method of shaping <b>sheet</b> <b>glass</b> is presented. This method reduces the surface waviness of a <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> and changes its shape while it is in its hot state and without contacting its surface. A <b>sheet</b> of <b>glass</b> is inserted between two parallel porous mandrels such that it is at a predefined distance from the two. A thin layer of pressurized gas flows through each mandrel and out against the glass surfaces. The resulting viscous flow against the heated soft <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> changes its surface topography. By using flat mandrels and controlled pressurized gas at temperatures close to 600 °C, the outcome is a flat <b>sheet</b> of <b>glass</b> with its original immaculate optical qualities. The flow in porous mandrels and the resulting pressure distribution along the surfaces of a <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> inserted between two porous mandrels is modeled. The design and manufacturing of an apparatus used to reduce the surface waviness of <b>glass</b> <b>sheets</b> at elevated temperatures is described. (cont.)
