Nevertheless, this production method is still a niche in Germany even it is found in organic farming. Reasons are the few publications about required investments of the needed technology for <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> in the barn. This article provides investment and energy costs for different drying techniques: for box <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> three different farm sizes were compared, for bale <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> only one farm size is calculated. Bale <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> demands more power and investment cost as box <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> of loose <b>hay.</b> Bale <b>drying</b> {{is more complicated than}} barn drying in that the number of bale drying locations in a barn is a limiting factor to throughput, as is also the drying of densely packed bales. Barn drying is above all practical on farms where hay is the only forage on offer. Its particular advantage is the large amounts of crop that can be dried at the same time. Bale drying tends to be applied more on farms that want their forage partly as grass silage and partly as barn-dried hay...|$|R

The experimental design was randomized blocks in split plots with four replications and five levels of nitrogen (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 kg ha- 1) in the form of urea, two regrowth ages (28 and 35 days) and <b>drying</b> <b>hay</b> in the sun and in shed.

The fungi were identified after seeding and growth in three steps of haymaking (cutting, baling and after 30 days of storage). To verify the presence of mycotoxins, 20 samples, composed of hay stored for 30 days, were collected, of which 10 samples were from sun-dried hay and 10 from <b>hay</b> <b>dried</b> in shed. It took 32 hours to produce hay at field conditions, with water loss rates up to 6. 10 g g- 1 DM-h during the first 8 hours after cutting.

40|$|Using a {{numerical}} approach, we explore wave-induced fluid flow effects in partially saturated porous rocks {{in which the}} gas-water saturation patterns are governed by mesoscopic heterogeneities associated with the <b>dry</b> <b>frame</b> properties. The link between the <b>dry</b> <b>frame</b> properties and the gas saturation {{is defined by the}} assumption of capillary pressure equilibrium, which in the presence of heterogeneity implies that neighbouring regions can exhibit different levels of saturation. To determine the equivalent attenuation and phase velocity of the synthetic rock samples considered in this study, we apply {{a numerical}} upscaling procedure, which permits to take into account mesoscopic heterogeneities associated with the <b>dry</b> <b>frame</b> properties as well as spatially continuous variations of the pore fluid properties. The multiscale nature of the fluid saturation is taken into account by locally computing the physical properties of an effective fluid, which are then used for the larger-scale simulations. We consider two sets of numerical experiments to analyse such effects in heterogeneous partially saturated porous media, where the saturation field is determined by variations in porosity and clay content, respectively. In both cases we also evaluate the seismic responses of corresponding binary, patchy-type saturation patterns. Our results indicate that significant attenuation and modest velocity dispersion effects take place in this kind of media for both binary patchy-type and spatially continuous gas saturation patterns and in particular in the presence of relatively small amounts of gas. The numerical experiments also show that the nature of the gas distribution patterns is a critical parameter controlling the seismic responses of these environments, since attenuation and velocity dispersion effects are much more significant and occur over a broader saturation range for binary patchy-type gas-water distributions. This analysis therefore suggests that the physical mechanisms governing partial saturation should be accounted for when analysing seismic data in a poroelastic framework. In this context, heterogeneities associated with the <b>dry</b> <b>frame</b> properties, which do not play important roles in wave-induced fluid flow processes per se, should be taken into account since they may determine the kind of gas distribution pattern taking place in the porous roc...|$|R
