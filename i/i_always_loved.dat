500|$|<b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> {{going to}} Ogmore and Southerndown. I thought the cliffs there {{looked like a}} {{building}} anyway. A building capable of withstanding the roughest weather for hundreds of years. The older they get, the better they look. I wondered {{if it would be}} possible to make a building which had the same qualities as these magnificent cliffs. To do that I needed a lot of stone. Normal stone for buildings has to be specially cut into blocks; it takes a long time to make and costs a fortune. But in north Wales the historic slate industry has left behind whole mountains of waste stone that no-one wants. This was stone cut from the mountainside for nearly two hundred years but which wasn't good enough to make roof slates. Over 90% was thrown away. But it was ideal for making walls like the one I had in mind... —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E
500|$|At age 11, Bell {{became a}} vegetarian. In an {{interview}} with PETA, Bell stated, [...] "I have always been an animal lover. I {{had a hard time}} disassociating the animals I cuddled with—dogs and cats, for example—from the animals on my plate, and I never really cared for the taste of meat. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> my Brussels sprouts!" [...] By 2012 Bell became vegan with her husband after watching the documentary Forks Over Knives. During her time in Michigan, Bell fostered animals from Michigan Humane Society and she now supports the San Diego-based Helen Woodward Animal Center. Bell often attends fund raisers for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and other non-profit organizations dedicated to protecting animals. She has a Welsh Corgi-Chow Chow mix named Lola, a Welsh Corgi-Chihuahua mix named Shakey, and a black Labrador Retriever named Sadie, who was 11 years old when she was rescued from Hurricane Katrina and adopted by Bell in 2005.|$|E
500|$|At age 12, Divine and {{his parents}} moved to Lutherville, a Baltimore suburb, where he {{attended}} Towson High School, graduating in 1963. Bullied because of his weight and perceived effeminacy, he later reminisced that he [...] "wasn't rough and tough" [...] but instead [...] "loved painting and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> flowers and things." [...] Due to this horticultural interest, at 15 he took a part-time job at a local florist's shop. Several years later, he went on a diet that enabled him to drop in weight from , giving him {{a new sense of}} confidence. When he was 17, his parents sent him to a psychiatrist, where he first realized his sexual attraction to men as well as women, something then taboo in conventional American society. He helped out at his parents' day care business, for instance dressing up as Santa Claus to entertain the children at Christmas time. In 1963, he began attending the Marinella Beauty School, where he learned hair styling and, after completing his studies, gained employment at a couple of local salons, specializing in the creation of beehives and other upswept hairstyles. Milstead eventually gave up his job and for a while was financially supported by his parents, who catered to his expensive taste in clothes and cars. They reluctantly paid the many bills that he ran up financing lavish parties where he would dress up in drag as his favourite celebrity, actress Elizabeth Taylor.|$|E

2500|$|Rubenstein {{called his}} two Dune miniseries [...] "science fiction {{for people who}} don't ordinarily like science fiction" [...] and {{suggested}} that [...] "the Dune saga tends to appeal to women {{in part because it}} features powerful female characters". Actress Sarandon agreed, saying [...] "One of the reasons <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> the books was because they were driven by strong women, living outside the rules." [...] She added that the Dune series [...] "is very apropos to some of what's {{going on in the world}} today. It's about the dangers of fundamentalism and the idea that absolute power corrupts." [...] Sarandon said of portraying Wensicia, [...] "it's always fun to play a smart villain." ...|$|E

2500|$|Being more {{in control}} of her {{performances}} also appeals to Reddy, who said, [...] "I have more leeway in the songs that I choose to sing. I'm not locked into what the record company wants." [...] She explained, [...] "One {{of the reasons that}} I'm coming back to singing is because I'm not doing the greatest hits.

60|$|I doctored {{him as well}} as I was able, hoping all {{the time}} in my inmost soul (for I will confess all now) that he would never recover. Already in wish I had become a murderer.
