The programmed move instructions are generated by an off-line graphic animator, and the data files are transferred through the internet. The data are of neutral text format and any robot controller with the proper interpreter can understand them. The controller operation can be monitored from a remote location, and control instructions can be issued remotely. An animation feedback interface allows for the <b>graphic</b> <b>monitoring</b> of {{the operation of the}} robot, the display of position errors, and sensor outputs. Various network tools are being tested for the real time transfer of data necessary for the last two interfaces. Again, the interface data are of neutral format...|$|E

The most accurate age estimation of woody plants {{can be obtained}} through dendrochronological techniques when the rings are well marked and constitute a reliable record of each annual growing season. Our work has focused on Vella pseudocytisus subsp. paui Gómez Campo, an endemic shrub which grows in a continental semiarid climate {{in the center of}} the Iberian Peninsula (Community of Aragón) (Figure 1), with only two extant populations and recently enlisted as Endangered in the Spanish Red Data List (Moreno, 2008).

Due to the fact that the species is strictly protected under the Aragonian law, we were able only to collect individuals known to be dead or removed by agricultural practices from both populations over the last ten years. After checking the existence of defined boundaries between rings, we have measured them in 126 trunk sections corresponding to 61 individuals (see Table 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} {{describe}} about the designing of control system {{in order to}} diminish energy wasting occur at the lecture halls. The main reason of the energy wasting {{is because of the}} position of lighting and air conditioning systems’ switches are located separately and at different places in the lecture hall, thereby make it difficult to lecturers and students to find the switch in order to on and off the equipments. In addition, it was make complicated and wasting time for students and lecturers to find the correct switch to on and off the equipment because switches are not denoted for which one lighting system and air conditioning system. This project can be divided into two major parts. The first one is an energy saving control system part, which consists of Graphic Liquid Crystal Display monitoring system and switching module whereas the second part is circuit driver of lighting and air conditioning development.

The <b>graphic</b> <b>monitor</b> is a resident auxiliary monitor which provides comprehensive managerial capability over the graphical system in response to commands from the human user. It also will respond to commands from a user program through a similar interface, where routine calls {{take the place of}} manual actions.

40|$|Objective: to {{optimize}} artificial ventilation {{on the basis}} of studies of lung mechanical properties in neonatal infants with visceroabdominal disproportion in the perioperative period. Subjects and methods. The investigation enrolled 57 neonates, including 42 (73. 7 %) with gastroschisis and 15 (26. 3 %) with omphalocele. All the patients received intensive care, artificial ventilation using a Bear Cub apparatus in the control modes by the volume (A/C, SIMV/PSV) with continuous monitoring of hemodynamics and respiratory mechanics (dynamic compliance, resistance, pressure-volume loop, and flow-volume) by applying a <b>graphics</b> <b>monitor.</b> Intraabdominal pressure (IAP) was measured by the Crohn method. Results. The investigation showed an association between the changes in IAP in different stages of the study and those in respiratory parameters in newborns. Preoperative adaptation of the respiratory system was noted in all the neonates. Within the first 24 hours of the first-stage correction of visceroabdominal disproportion, both groups showed a gradual reduction in dynamic compliance by 3. 4 times, a rise in resistance by 2. 42 times with PIP being increased up to high figures — 20 — 22 cm H 2 O, as well as maximum value changes on the <b>graphics</b> <b>monitor.</b> The mechanical properties of the lung returned to relatively normal values at 72 hours of extension. Conclusion. Elevation of IAP to high values causes changes in respiratory mechanics and is a rather informative criterion for correction of ventilation parameters. Furthermore, a marked perioperative IAP increase (more than 10 — 11 mm Hg) maximally affects the mechanical properties of the lung in neonatal infants with visceroab-dominal disproportion.
