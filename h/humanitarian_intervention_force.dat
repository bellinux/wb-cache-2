40|$|<b>Humanitarian</b> <b>Intervention</b> is a widely-debated {{doctrine}} {{of international law}} that is seen to be between law and non-law. It also touches upon principles of international law such as human rights, sovereignty and justice. It has invoked moral and ethical debates. This grey area of law has arguably produced moral, political and legal narratives about <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> These narratives {{can be seen in}} the context of the NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999. This was a significant case of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> in the 1990 s as it involved the use of force by a group of states without the UNSC’s authorisation for the action. This thesis will set out the dominant moral, political and legal narratives produced in the NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999. These different narratives are set out and analysed in chapters divided into moral, political and legal narratives on <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> These narratives will be identified from various discourse and texts of political actors, international lawyers, international institutions and scholars. The narratives will be analysed in terms of their effect and significance. Also, the issues and shortcomings of these storylines will be considered. It will be argued that these stories contributed to our constant fascination and resort to the {{doctrine of}} <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> Moral storylines were the most dominant in the Kosovo intervention. Moral and ethical reasoning was predominantly employed to support the intervention. Also, political narratives were important in justifying the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> in Kosovo. Therefore, legal arguments had less prominence in justifying the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> As such, international lawyers and political actors turned to politics and morality instead of the law when justifying the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> in Kosovo. These moral, political and legal narratives produced by <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> in Kosovo are complex and competing storylines. However, these stories are all linked and together produce an overarching storyline about <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> This overarching storyline is that <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> is by an international community protecting the key values of human rights, morality, justice and peace. This action is vital and needed and the international community has a duty to intervene in these serious human rights violations that are the concern of all states. This overarching story can be seen to benefit the Western states who invoke this doctrine of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> They are the states with the power and resources to undertake these <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions</b> in a <b>humanitarian</b> crisis in another state. Furthermore, the values that such storylines benefit are those of human rights, justice, peace and morality. These values are invoked throughout the different storylines. However, these values are defined by the Western international lawyers and political actors who adopt these narratives on intervention. Therefore, the stories arguably benefit Western values and ideals. As a result, the stories can be seen to elevate the West’s interests over other states. There is value in drawing this complex story about <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> in Kosovo as it shows the significance of these narratives. These narratives are significant as they can be seen to present a desirable and favourable story about <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> So, one perspective on the significance of these narratives is that they make <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> appear desirable. The narratives are also significant as they demonstrate how we think and speak about international law and how these stories contributed to the fascination and resort to the doctrine of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> by states. Furthermore, they show how we view international law and its limits. Also, they demonstrate how the actors who told such stories were relevant and created themselves a role to play in these <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions.</b> However, these narratives about <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> only present a certain limited and favourable story about <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> in Kosovo. These narratives have issues and shortcomings which are important to understand. Moral reasoning was dominant in the narratives on intervention, as such the narratives demonstrate the dangers of moral reasoning about the law. The stories are also employed by Western international lawyers and political actors and it is the powerful Western states who invoked this doctrine of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> Therefore, the narratives highlight the issues of power politics and hegemonic politics involved in <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention...</b>|$|R

40|$|Although the {{legality}} of approved <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> is undisputable in the positive international law, this legal institute should be further regulated in order to remove certain legal ambiguity and difficulties in its application. The future regulation of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> may be carried out {{in one of the}} three ways: by adopting a special international treaty, by entering amendments in the UN Charter, or by embarking on the factual revision of the UN Charter. Due to the limiting effects of Article 103 of the UN Charter as well as the problematic status of UN member states which would not ratify the international agreements on <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention,</b> the regulation of future <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> seems to be the least likely option. Formal revision of the UN Charter is not a viable option either because, thus far, the major world powers have been against introducing any substantial changes to this treaty. For this reason, the factual revision of the UN Charter is currently the most appropriate way of regulating future <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions.</b> When it comes to substantive rules governing <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention,</b> it is necessary to focus on the problem of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> decision-making {{as well as on the}} conditions and criteria for the approval and carrying out a <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> The UN Security Council must retain the right to decide on approving such an intervention but it is also necessary to establish an independent expert body whose task would be to determine the presence of serious and mass violations of human rights in a specific country and notify the Security Council about such occurrences. The specification of conditions and criteria for undertaking a <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> should strengthen its legitimacy and prevent unreasonable disruption of states' territorial integrity and political independence...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the practice of}} <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> {{after the end of}} the Cold War. In the 90 s there was an evident willingness of the world community to promote and protect human rights. The Security Council got involved in matters traditionally regarded internal affairs of states and imposed economic and diplomatic sanctions. What is more, the UN authorised military interventions in cases where massive abuses of human rights have taken place and this is the most significant normative change regarding <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> Thus, from "unilateral" <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> we move to "collective" <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> Accordingly, the UN Security Council authorised military action in Somalia, Rwanda and Haiti. Yet, although the Council granted authorisation of the use of force, states had been reluctant to recognise a "unilateral" right of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> Kosovo is the most challenging case that caused a wide debate regarding the legality of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> Yet, Kosovo has set a very bad precedent for <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> NATO's violations of humanitarian laws, the bombing against civilian infrastructures, as well as the significant loss of civilian lives proved that the means used were against the proclaimed humanitarian ends. Furthermore, NATO intervention did not bring peace to Kosovo, but the situation remains tense. Thus, it could be argued that the 1999 intervention did not bring a positive and long-term outcome. This is a good case that can illustrate how political and moral omissions can create bad precedents for the emergence of a new norm. Finally, this thesis concludes that after the attacks of 9 / 11, the prospects of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> in the future are questionable. War against terrorism became the new form of interventionism in the new millennium. Thus, omissions and failures of the past, along with the new challenges of the world community have curtailed the future of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{compares the}} ideas of two {{prominent}} figures in contemporary political philosophy, John Rawls and Jürgen Habermas, about <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> and initiatives to preempt such moves. Indeed this thesis asks two important questions. Firstly, how do Rawls and Habermas justify <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> in cases of gross violations of human rights? And secondly, how do they prevent those gross violations under the threshold of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> I compare the philosophers’ {{answers to these questions}} and analyze which one better tackles the problems of gross violations of human rights. Both philosophers consider <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> as a legitimate political means to prevent gross violations of human rights around the world. It is true that resort to <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> is sometimes the only effective means to stop or de-escalate atrocities. However, I argue this should not obscure the fact that <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> usually causes a range of new human rights violations because of its coercive nature. Moreover, as gross human rights violations provide the justification for resort to <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention,</b> shouldn’t we search for initiatives to reduce the possibility of those violations in the first instance? Indeed, Rawls and Habermas have attended to this question, too, in their theories of just international order. The ideas of Rawls and Habermas on the justification of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention,</b> as well as initiatives to pre-empt it, are tightly interconnected with other elements of their theories. Therefore, this thesis first outlines the two philosophers’ viewpoints on global justice and international human rights. It then analyzes and compares their thoughts on <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention,</b> as well as measures to pre-empt interventions. I conclude that Habermas’s theory provides the ground, better than Rawls, for tackling the problem of gross violations of human rights in today’s world...|$|R

40|$|A <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> is a {{military}} intervention conducted {{in order to provide}} urgent relief from serious and persistent human rights violations. Prior to the creation of general international organizations, <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions</b> were effectuated by the unilateral action of one state in the territory of another, which, by the early twentieth century, would have been unlawful but for, arguably, the humanitarian justification. Now, <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> also refers to <b>interventions</b> for <b>humanitarian</b> purposes by international organizations. Such organizational actions are significant, from a legal standpoint, only if the humanitarian impulse is the sole authoritative basis for the action in question.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the theory and}} practice of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> in the modern states system. <b>Humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> is defined as {{the use of military force}} across state boundaries, against the wishes of the target government, to protect the people from intolerable misrule and grave abuses of human rights. The aim of this thesis is to examine the problem of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> from the perspective of international society. This thesis is divided into two parts. Part One defines the concept, considers the historical and intellectual milieu in which the idea emerged and evolved, and {{examines the}} different grounds upon which states have justified a right of intervention. Part Two considers the implications for international society. International society exists when states have shared rules, values, and a mutual concern for order. Three primary arguments are made in Part Two: (1) <b>Humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> can co-exist with the rules of state sovereignty, non-intervention, and limitations on the use of force; (2) <b>Humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> has performed the historic function of expanding the values of international society; (3) Practised under the right circumstances, it can help promote international order rather than subvert it. As this thesis demonstrates, a more in-depth understanding of how past theorists and practitioners of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> have approached the problem can enrich the current discussion. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> though {{critical}} {{continues to be}} elusive in many conflict situations despite there being clear international, regional and local guiding policies and legal frameworks on <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> The study therefore sought to critically analyses the successes, failures and challenges of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> as a conflict management tool using the just war theory as the underpinning theory. The study assumed the desktop methodology through extensive {{review of existing literature}} on <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> as a conflict management tool. The analysis found that <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> is justifiable in instances where there are gross human rights violations, however; certain factors must be put into consideration before embarking on the intervention. Successful interventions were found to largely dependent on multiple factors key among them being the involvement of stakeholders in the entire process. The study also revealed that not all interventions are successful and some have resulted in various degrees of failure largely due to challenges of timing, coordination, vested interests among interveners as well as geo-political factors. The paper concludes by recommending that <b>humanitarian</b> <b>interventions</b> should be based on the existing legal frameworks devoid of any strategic motives. Equally, interventions should involve key stakeholders and adopt context specific measures to cater for the different needs of a conflict situation to avert further human rights abuses...|$|R

One example is of a successful <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> and also of humanitarian principles being applied is East Timor which, prior to its independence, was plagued with massive human rights abuses by pro-Indonesian militias and an insurgency war led by indigenous East Timorese against Indonesian forces. A peacekeeping mission was deployed to safeguard the move to independence and the UN established the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). This not only dealt with traditional security priorities, but also helped in nation building projects, coordinated humanitarian aid and civil rehabilitation, illustrating not only a successful <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> but also an effective application of human security principles.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the US {{response to the}} 1994 Rwandan genocide. It argues that in 1994, the US was retooling its stance on <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> because of the disastrous US-led Operation Gothic Serpent in Somalia in 1993. Therefore, the American response to the genocide in Rwanda became a casualty of Washington’s reassessment of its <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> policy in the 1990 s. The reason behind the US adoption of a more muscular <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> policy was {{due in part to}} the end of the Cold War in 1991. Thus, the US was able to focus on other issues in international affairs, such as human security, which became a focal point of George H. W Bush’s New World Order. This policy plan outlined areas in which the US could assist the world with human rights issues through cooperation with the United Nations. In 1993, the Clinton Administration expanded the principles of Bush’s New World Order to create a muscular American foreign policy platform that imposed US domestic ideas of human rights on international affairs. Subsequent polarizing events would force the US to retreat from <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention.</b> This resulted in a new, lukewarm approach to <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> by the Clinton Administration. The new cautious approach to <b>humanitarian</b> <b>intervention</b> affected the US response to the genocide in Rwanda.
