5|$|The {{polynomial}} Euclidean algorithm <b>has</b> <b>other</b> applications, such as Sturm chains, {{a method}} for counting the zeros of a polynomial that lie inside a given real interval.

5|$|A {{peroxidase}} enzyme {{known as}} MroAPO (Marasmius rotula aromatic peroxygenase) is attracting research interest for possible applications in biocatalysis. In general, enzymes that catalyze oxygen-transfer reactions are of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions. Fungal peroxidases can catalyze oxidations {{that are difficult}} for the organic chemist, including those involving aromatic substrates such as aniline, 4-aminophenol, hydroquinone, resorcinol, catechol, and paracetamol. The M.rotula enzyme is the first fungal peroxygenase that can be produced in high yields. It is highly stable over a wide pH range, and {{in a variety of}} organic solvents. The enzyme <b>has</b> <b>other</b> potential for use as a biosensor for aromatic substances in environmental analysis and drug monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Apollonius' problem <b>has</b> <b>other</b> applications. In Book 1, Proposition 21 in his Principia, Isaac Newton {{used his}} {{solution}} of Apollonius' problem {{to construct an}} orbit in celestial mechanics {{from the center of}} attraction and observations of tangent lines to the orbit corresponding to instantaneous velocity. The special case of the problem of Apollonius when all three circles are tangent is used in the Hardy–Littlewood circle method of analytic number theory to construct Hans Rademacher's contour for complex integration, given by the boundaries of an infinite set of Ford circles each of which touches several others. Finally, Apollonius' problem has been applied to some types of packing problems, which arise in disparate fields such as the error-correcting codes used on DVDs and the design of pharmaceuticals that bind in a particular enzyme of a pathogenic bacterium.|$|E

5|$|As Madge and {{her family}} turns to {{celebrate}} Christmas, the Doctor attempts to slip away, but Madge catches him, and as she sees the TARDIS realises {{that he is the}} man in the space suit from three years before. She insists on his staying for Christmas dinner, but the Doctor reveals he <b>has</b> <b>other</b> friends who believe he is dead. Madge convinces him to go to see them. The Doctor offers Madge his help if she ever needs it again. Later, the Doctor arrives outside the home of Amy (Karen Gillan) and Rory (Arthur Darvill), two years since he left them there ("The God Complex"). They invite him to have Christmas dinner, as they had always set him a place at the dinner table. Unseen by them, the Doctor wipes away a tear of joy.|$|E
5|$|Blacklist {{also has}} a {{co-operative}} multiplayer mode, where each mission can be accessed by talking with {{the crew of the}} Paladin. Crew members offer a variety of missions and requirements for completing them, and players play as Fisher or his colleague Briggs; both have the same abilities. The game has a total of 14 missions, with split-screen play supported. In addition to co-op and Spies vs. Mercs, Blacklist <b>has</b> <b>other</b> multiplayer modes including Uplink control, Team Deathmatch, and Extraction.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{flies to}} Imperial Iran (Persia) to investigate. Gorner owns {{factories}} and produces legitimate pharmaceuticals, however MI6 suspects he <b>has</b> <b>other</b> motives. During Bond's investigation he identifies Gorner {{due to a}} deformity of his hand, and establishes Gorner's complicity in a scheme to not only flood Europe with cheap drugs but also to launch a two-pronged terrorist attack on the Soviet Union, whose retaliation will subsequently devastate the UK. The attack is to be made using a stolen British airliner, earlier hijacked over Iraqi airspace, and an ekranoplan. Bond is assisted in his investigation by Scarlett Papava (whose twin sister Poppy is under Gorner's emotional spell), Darius Alizadeh (the local head of station), JD Silver (an in-situ agent), and Felix Leiter.|$|E

In Broward County, {{there is the}} FIU Pines Center in Pembroke Pines, opened to satisfy the demand from Broward County residents. This center serves mostly night students in programs within the College of Business Administration. In Miami-Dade County, there are four regional FIU facilities, the Downtown Miami Center, the Wolfsonian-FIU Museum in Miami Beach (Washington Avenue and 10th St), the FIU-Florida Memorial research center in Miami Gardens, and a research site in Homestead.|$|E
5|$|Findings {{from the}} Dawn {{spacecraft}} have {{found evidence that}} the troughs that wrap around Vesta could be graben formed by impact-induced faulting (see Troughs section above), meaning that Vesta has more complex geology than other asteroids. Vesta could have been classified as a dwarf planet if it had retained a spherical shape, and it <b>has</b> <b>other</b> qualities {{that lead to the}} thought it could be a protoplanet. The only thing that knocked it out of the category of a dwarf planet was the formation of two large impact basins at its southern pole. At the time of these impacts Vesta was not warm and plastic enough to return to a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Imaginative space {{also serves}} an {{important}} function within the poem. Part one contains a rose garden that allegorically represents potential within human existence. Although the garden does not exist, it {{is described in}} realistic manner and is portrayed as an imagined reality. Also, the narrator's statement that words exist in the mind allows this imagined reality to be shared between the narrator and the reader. This is then destroyed by the narrator claiming that such a place has no purpose. The garden image <b>has</b> <b>other</b> uses within the poem beyond creating a shared imaginative space; it serves to invoke memories within the poem, and it functions {{in a similar manner}} in other works by Eliot, including The Family Reunion.|$|E

One night, he then tries to milk Lois in her sleep. He pumps her breasts and succeeds, but spills and desperately tries licking it up. Stewie realizes how pathetic he is and accepts his weaning. He comes to Brian and informs {{that he is now}} off breast milk, but Lois <b>has</b> <b>other</b> plans. Lois allows Stewie to be breastfed again, thus delighting him.|$|E
