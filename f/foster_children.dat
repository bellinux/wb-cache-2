5|$|Frank Jonathan Morgan is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian Channel Seven soap opera Home and Away, played by Alex Papps. Frank debuted on-screen in the serial's pilot episode {{and was the}} first character to appear. Frank is one of the five <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> of Pippa (Vanessa Downing) and Tom Fletcher (Roger Oakley) who move to Summer Bay to begin a new life. The serial's creator Alan Bateman thought of the idea while observing the locals of a rural town in New South Wales opposing the idea of <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> living in the area. Papps was cast into the role and immediately began receiving fan mail. Frank has been played by actors Bradley Pilato and Michael Scilusa during flashback sequences.|$|E
5|$|In , (1872) the Supreme Court {{heard another}} Civil Rights Act case {{relating}} to federal courts in Kentucky. John Blyew and George Kennard were white men visiting the cabin {{of a black}} family, the Fosters. Blyew apparently became angry with sixteen-year-old Richard Foster and hit him twice {{in the head with}} an ax. Blyew and Kennard killed Richard's parents, Sallie and Jack Foster, and his blind grandmother, Lucy Armstrong. They severely wounded the Fosters' two young daughters. Kentucky courts would not allow the <b>Foster</b> <b>children</b> to testify against Blyew and Kennard. But federal courts, authorized by the Civil Rights Act, found Blyew and Kennard guilty of murder. When the Supreme Court took the case, they ruled (5–2) that the <b>Foster</b> <b>children</b> did not have standing in federal courts because only living people could take advantage of the Act. In doing so, the Courts effectively ruled that Thirteenth Amendment did not permit a federal remedy in murder cases. Swayne and Joseph P. Bradley dissented, maintaining that in order to have meaningful effects, the Thirteenth Amendment would have to address systemic racial oppression.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{theory has}} {{implications}} in residence and contact disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt <b>foster</b> <b>children.</b> In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus {{focusing on the}} quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along {{with the impact of}} step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to better understand, from a foster parent perspective, how the {{integration}} process of the <b>foster</b> <b>child</b> is carried out in the foster family. The purpose is to identify the challenges and success factors in the process. The study is based on a qualitative method. The data consist of interviews with six foster families. The study’s theoretical framework is mostly based on system theory and also on the theory of ambivalence. The results show that most of our families considered five factors to be important in order to facilitate the integration process. The foster family needs to bond with the <b>foster</b> <b>child,</b> let the <b>foster</b> <b>child</b> in into the family system, open up and be who they really are, respect each other and reserve time to be able to satisfy the needs of <b>foster</b> <b>child.</b> The results emphasize that the foster parents should treat the <b>foster</b> <b>child</b> in the same way as the biological child.   We have also been able to identify factors that may have an impact on integration, like the age of the <b>foster</b> <b>child.</b> Our results suggest that foster parents experience different varieties of ambivalence to both the <b>foster</b> <b>child</b> and the <b>foster</b> <b>child's</b> biological parents. Those children who have a poor relationship with their biological parents and are of relatively young age tend to be over-integrated in the foster family...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} the present study was to explore the {{potential}} influence of direct-to-consumer genetic test results of a pre-adoptive <b>foster</b> <b>child</b> on the decision of the prospective adoptive foster parents to finalize or disrupt their adoption of the <b>foster</b> <b>child.</b> A quantitative survey was conducted using a sample of foster parents with three distinct statuses as a foster parent. They included, foster parents in the process of adopting their <b>foster</b> <b>child,</b> <b>foster</b> parents awaiting placement of a <b>foster</b> <b>child</b> in their home, and individuals in the process of completing training to become foster parents. The study participants were from a foster family agency that specializes in foster adoptions and all study participants had indicated they wanted to adopt a <b>foster</b> <b>child.</b> The <b>foster</b> family agency has two locations, one in Orange County and the other in San Bernardino County. Study data was collected through the use of a self-report questionnaire at five different foster family agency events. Twelve original survey questions were designed to measure three core areas: knowledge of prospective adoptive foster parents on the information direct-to-consumer genetic testing can provide; attitudes of prospective adoptive foster parents regarding the use of direct-to-consumer genetic testing as a pre-adoption screening tool; and, if direct-to-consumer genetic test results of a <b>foster</b> <b>child</b> influences the decision of prospective adoptive foster parents to finalize or disrupt a foster adoption. Using SPSS software to analyze data, descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation analyses were conducted between the three different foster parent statuses and the four questions designed to measure the core area of if direct-to-consumer genetic test results of a <b>foster</b> <b>child</b> influences the decision of prospective adoptive foster parents to finalize or disrupt a foster adoption. More than half of the survey participants, identified as women (n= 39, 54. 9 %) and 32 (23. 9 %) identified as men. Results showed that there was a significant relationship found between the direct-to-consumer genetic test results of a <b>foster</b> <b>child</b> to influence the prospective adoptive foster parent to stop adoption proceedings for the child with the status of foster parents awaiting placement of the first <b>foster</b> <b>child</b> into their home...|$|R

5|$|The cast filmed {{the pilot}} in 1987. Papps' casting was {{announced}} {{ahead of the}} series debut. The series first aired on 17 January 1988 on the Seven Network. Frank was the first character to appear, although a Police officer (Bruce Venables) spoke {{the first piece of}} dialogue. Frank was played by Bradley Pilato in the scene, which was set in 1978 as a young Frank tries to escape from the Police officer. The series then switches to 1988, where Frank is one of five <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> alongside Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson), Steven Matheson (Adam Willits), Lynn Davenport (Helena Bozich) and Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie). Tom loses his job in the city and moves the Fletcher family to the town of Summer Bay.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some {{within the field of}} attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors. The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable. Severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties. Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders. Resilience is a common and normal human characteristic. RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in <b>foster</b> <b>children,</b> adoptive children, or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or problem behaviors are not a benchmark for estimates of RAD.|$|E

5|$|Monroe's early {{childhood}} was stable and happy. While Gladys was mentally and financially unprepared for a child, {{she was able}} to place Monroe with foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender in the rural town of Hawthorne soon after the birth. They raised their <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> according to the principles of evangelical Christianity. At first, Gladys lived with the Bolenders and commuted to work in Los Angeles, until longer work shifts forced her to move back to the city in early 1927. She then began visiting her daughter on weekends, often taking her to the cinema and to sightsee in Los Angeles. Although the Bolenders wanted to adopt Monroe, by the summer of 1933, Gladys felt stable enough for Monroe to move in with her and bought a small house in Hollywood. They shared it with lodgers, actors George and Maude Atkinson and their daughter, Nellie. Some months later, in January 1934, Gladys had a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. After several months in a rest home, she was committed to the Metropolitan State Hospital. She spent {{the rest of her life}} in and out of hospitals, and was rarely in contact with Monroe.|$|E

40|$|The {{authors of}} this paper seek {{to find out the}} {{experiences}} of biological children growing-up in families together with <b>foster</b> <b>child</b> / children. This has been the first research in Lithuania with the aim to provide a deeper understanding of this phenomenon from the very own perspective of biological children. A qualitative research has been conducted. Two methods of defining the target group sample were combined: selection according to convenience and the snowball selection. The participants of the research were young persons from age 13 to 19 : 2 boys and 8 girls, living in their biological families that raise <b>foster</b> <b>child</b> (children). Semi-structural interview has been selected as the main instrument for reaching the research goal. Collected qualitative data was analyzed by using the method of interpretative phenomenological analysis. The research has shown that after a <b>foster</b> <b>child</b> comes into a foster family, the whole family life changes: interpersonal relationships, roles, rules. The <b>foster</b> parents’ biological <b>children</b> go through a range of different emotions: confusion, surprise, loss, anxiety, fear, might feel neglected or pushed aside. Usually it takes quite {{a long time to get}} used to the changed situation and to a new member in their family. Frequently, if biological children are older then the <b>foster</b> <b>child,</b> they will take up a role of an older sister or brother, and the duties that accompany these roles. If <b>foster</b> parents’ biological <b>children</b> get attached to <b>foster</b> <b>child,</b> they will go through difficult experiences when a <b>foster</b> <b>child</b> leaves the family. It has been found out that a <b>fostering</b> of a <b>child</b> in their family is worthy: biological children learn to take care of younger children, to be emphatic, to understand other people, as well as acquire dailylife problem solving skills.
