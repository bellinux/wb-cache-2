40|$|The {{number of}} {{appliances}} {{at home is}} increasing continuously, mainly because they make our lives easier. Currently, technology is integrated in all objects of our daily life. TCP/IP let us monitor our home in real time and check ubiquitously if something is happening at home. Bearing in mind this idea, we have developed a low-cost system, {{which can be used}} in any type of <b>electrical</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> that takes information from the appliance and posts the information to the Twitter Social network. Several sensors placed in the household appliances gather the sensed data and send them wired or wirelessly, depending on the case, using small and cheap devices to a gateway located in the home. This gateway takes decisions, based on the received data, and sends notifications to Twitter. We have developed a software application that takes the values and decides when to issue an alarm to the registered users (Twitter friends of our smart home). The performance of our system has been measured taking into account the home network (using IEEE 802. 3 u and IEEE 802. 11 g) and the data publishing in Twitter. As a result, we have generated an original product and service for any <b>electrical</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliance,</b> regardless of the model and manufacturer, that helps home users improve their quality of life. The paper also shows that there is no system with the same innovative features like the ones presented in this paper...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The use of {{polymeric}} {{material in the}} last years has been increased exponentially in modern industries such as: aeronautical, car, electrical and electronics, chemical, <b>electrical</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliance,</b> etc. These industrial applications lead frequently to mechanical loading and environmental attack, reducing the expected industrial life. ABS {{is one of the most}} used {{polymeric material}}s for its high mechanical and physical properties: high impact resistance, good shape stability with temperature variation, low polymeric degradation with ultraviolet radiation, good mechanical toughness. This work is devoted to investigate the ultrasonic fatigue endurance of polymeric material ABS and the general mechanism of crack initiation and propagation when the specimens are tested immersed in water and in oil, in order to limit the temperature increasing induced by the high mechanical vibration of ultrasonic fatigue testing.

With steadily increased home automation applications, it {{is becoming more and}} more popular for individuals to use one central control interface to set up and operate of all the audio, video and many household appliances in a home. However, such interfaces often are too complicated for people with a disability to operate. However, the technology has long been available to achieve Environmental Control (EC) for disabled people with limited mobility, which then helps them live with more independence. This paper presents a specially designed EC system for use by people who have lost significant mobility but who have good control of their eye movements.

Remote control is having a great impact in making life easier; it is a device has an ability to control apparatus from a distance by means of signals. In this project we presented design of a simple universal remote control that have the ability to control multiple electrical devices. The {{goal of this}} thesis is design low-cost device and easy to use for physically disabled people with limited mobility who they cannot move to operate <b>electrical</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> so they need a simple device that allow them to control these appliances without needing help. The universal remote control is the solution from this problem, this thesis discuss the design and implementation of the universal remote control using USART protocol that provide serial transmission of the commands that operate the electrical devices from the transmitter to the receiver device, these commands are transmitted using infrared radiation emitted by the IR led transmitter and received by IR sensor. The system based on microcontrollers so sit offers the advantage of having small size, light weight and portability which provide the simplicity and the ease of use. The efficiency of this system could be improved by further optimizations. Also further work is needed to improve the system and more devices can be added to be controlled and operated...|$|R

40|$|The <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> in {{buildings}} have increased {{rapidly in the}} recent years. However, the surge withstanding capability of these <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> has not been increased. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} install surge protection device (SPD) to prevent serious damage of <b>household</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>appliances</b> caused by the in-rushing surges. In order to avoid the oscillation phenomenon, the effective protection distance of SPDs should be addressed before installing SPDs in the buildings. This paper discussed the influence of a group of common <b>household</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>appliances</b> connected in parallel on the effective protection distance of an SPD to a <b>household</b> <b>appliance.</b> The surges impinging on the <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> connected to a distribution system are analyzed using electromagnetic transient analysis software.
