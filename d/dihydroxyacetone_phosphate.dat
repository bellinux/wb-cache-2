25|$|Triosephosphate {{isomerase}} rapidly interconverts <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> <b>phosphate</b> with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GADP) that proceeds {{further into}} glycolysis. This is advantageous, as it directs <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> <b>phosphate</b> {{down the same}} pathway as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, simplifying regulation.|$|E
25|$|The {{glycerol}} {{released by}} lipase action is phosphorylated by glycerol kinase {{in the liver}} (the only tissue in which this reaction can occur), and the resulting glycerol 3-phosphate is oxidized to <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> <b>phosphate.</b> The glycolytic enzyme triose phosphate isomerase converts this compound to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which is oxidized via glycolysis, or converted to glucose via gluconeogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Destabilizing the {{molecule}} {{in the previous}} reaction allows the hexose ring to be split by aldolase into two triose sugars: <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> <b>phosphate</b> (a ketose), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (an aldose). There are two classes of aldolases: class I aldolases, present in animals and plants, and class II aldolases, present in fungi and bacteria; the two classes use different mechanisms in cleaving the ketose ring.|$|E
25|$|Glycolysis is a {{determined}} sequence of ten enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The intermediates provide entry points to glycolysis. For example, most monosaccharides, such as fructose and galactose, {{can be converted}} to one of these intermediates. The intermediates may also be directly useful. For example, the intermediate <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> <b>phosphate</b> (DHAP) is a source of the glycerol that combines with fatty acids to form fat.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} {{regulated}} step (the third step of glycolysis), phosphofructokinase converts fructose-6-phosphate into fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, which then is converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> <b>phosphate.</b> [...] The <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> <b>phosphate</b> {{can be removed}} from glycolysis by conversion into glycerol-3-phosphate, {{which can be used}} to form triglycerides.

2500|$|The methylglyoxal pathway is {{activated}} by the increased intercellular uptake of carbon containing molecules such as glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, lactate, or glycerol.

2500|$|Step 5 in {{the figure}} is shown behind the other steps, because that step is a {{side-reaction}} that can decrease or increase the concentration of the intermediate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.

[...] The fact that Î”G is not zero indicates that the actual concentrations in the erythrocyte are not accurately known.|$|E
2500|$|The {{glycerol}} {{released into}} the blood during the lipolysis of triglycerides in adipose tissue can only be {{taken up by the}} liver. Here it is converted into glycerol 3-phosphate by the action of glycerol kinase which hydrolyzes one molecule of ATP per glycerol molecule which is phosphorylated. Glycerol 3-phosphate is then oxidized to <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> <b>phosphate,</b> which is, in turn, converted into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by the enzyme triose phosphate isomerase. From here the three carbon atoms of the original glycerol can be [...] oxidized via glycolysis, or converted to glucose via gluconeogenesis.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the second}} {{regulated}} step (the third step of glycolysis), phosphofructokinase converts fructose-6-phosphate into fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, which then is converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> <b>phosphate.</b> The <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> <b>phosphate</b> {{can be removed}} from glycolysis by conversion into glycerol-3-phosphate, {{which can be used}} to form triglycerides.

50|$|When {{pyruvate}} of lactate {{is used as}} {{the precursor}} for glycerol 3-phosphate, glyceroneogenesis follows exactly the same pathway as gluconeogenesis until it generates <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> <b>phosphate.</b> Lactate catalysed by lactate dehydrogenase will form pyruvate with expense of NAD+. Furthermore, by using 1 ATP and bicarbonate, pyruvate will be converted to oxaloacetate. which is catalysed by pyruvate carboxylase. Oxaloacetate will be catalysed by PEPC-K to generate phosphoenolpyruvate. This phosphorylation and decarboxylation of oxaloacetate is the significant step in glyceroneogenesis because the entire pathway is regulated by this reaction. After the production of phosphoenolpyruvate, gluconeogenesis will continue until <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> <b>phosphate</b> is generated, which produces 2-phosphoglycerate, 3-phosphoglycerate, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as intermediates. When <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> <b>phosphate</b> is produced, glyceroneogenesis will branch off from gluconeogenesis. With expense of NADH, <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> <b>phosphate</b> will convert to glycerol 3- phosphate (Figure 4), which is the final product of glyceroneogenesis. In addition, triglyceride can be generated by re-esterification of 3 fatty acid chains on glycerol 3-phosphate. Therefore, glyceroneogenesis is a metabolic pathway starting from lactate or pyruvate, and it is similar to gluconeogenesis but the pathway will branch out when <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> <b>phosphate</b> is generated. Instead of producing fructose 1,6- bisphosphate as gluconeogenesis does, glyceroneogenesis converts <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> <b>phosphate</b> to glycerol 3-phosphate.|$|E
