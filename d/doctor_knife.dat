40|$|This {{study is}} aimed {{to search the}} angle {{optimization}} of scraping/doctor knife in the drum dryers. Electrical measurements were made via a digital ohmmeter to calculate the real contact area between the drum and <b>doctor</b> <b>knife.</b> It was seen that the electrical resistance was decreased with the increment of drum’s load. It’s also seen that, the contact resistance between the couple was increased with the increment of temperature. This is an experimental practice; AISI 4140 for a drum material, HSS for a <b>doctor</b> <b>knife</b> were used. So as to increase the hardness and to reduce the resistance, the drum was coated with the harder chromium, {{and then it was}} ground for the enhancement of the surface quality...|$|E
5000|$|Unfortunately once {{returned}} to St. Cloud, Chance discovers Heavenly {{is only a}} shadow of the girl he knew. During his last visit to St. Cloud, he had unknowingly infected her with a disease he picked up {{as a result of}} his own promiscuity. When she discovered the problem, she had to have surgery to cut the disease out and which, because of an unskilled <b>doctor's</b> <b>knife,</b> resulted in a hysterectomy. Heavenly's corrupt father and brother are determined to make Chance pay for the injury done to Heavenly. Chance worries that he will receive the same fate as a black man who was recently attacked and castrated in the town.|$|R
60|$|Out of {{the eight}} men who had fallen in the action, only three still breathed--that one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole, Hunter, and Captain Smollett; and of these the first two were as good as dead; the mutineer, indeed, died under the <b>doctor's</b> <b>knife,</b> and Hunter, do what we could, never {{recovered}} consciousness in this world. He lingered all day, breathing loudly, like the old buccaneer at home in his apoplectic fit; but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the blow and his skull fractured in falling, and {{some time in the}} following night, without sign or sound, he went to his Maker.|$|R

[...] After {{a number of}} limited releases, Nicoll formed the then solo project B!

50|$|Tape casting (also called <b>doctor</b> blading and <b>knife</b> coating) is {{a casting}} process {{used in the}} {{manufacture}} of thin ceramic tapes and sheets from ceramic slurry. The ceramic slurry is cast in a thin layer onto a flat surface and then dried and sintered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wilson {{shuddered and}} obeyed. A good wrench caused the lid to start, {{and while he}} held it {{partially}} open the <b>doctor</b> inserted the <b>knife.</b> For five minutes he continued to twist and work with his arms, muttering between his teeth, every now and then, {{that he was a}} `tough subject,' while the crackling of bones, and other disagreeable sounds, struck upon the horrified ears of his companion.|$|R
5000|$|The {{three of}} them come in to Ursus' {{workshop}} and while speaking to Ursus and the goddess, the Doctor figures something out. He says to Minerva [...] "I wish I could see what you really look like." [...] and Rose spies a creature in a box {{that looks like a}} cross between a dragon and a platypus. Ursus in fury lunges at the <b>Doctor</b> with a <b>knife,</b> but Ursus touches Vanessa (turning her to stone), and Rose jumps on Ursus' back. She knocks him down and he falls on his own dagger, but the Doctor was also turned to stone during the chaos. Rose wishes that he had never come to Rome, and then the Doctor had vanished.|$|R
50|$|The Expendables—led by Barney Ross {{and formed}} by Lee Christmas, Gunner Jensen, and Toll Road—extract former member <b>Doctor</b> Death, a <b>knives</b> {{specialist}} and team medic, {{from a military}} prison during his transfer on a train. They recruit Doc {{to assist them in}} intercepting a shipment of bombs meant to be delivered to a warlord in Somalia. Arriving there, they reunite with Hale Caesar, who directs them to the drop point, where Ross is surprised to find out that the arms trader providing the bombs is Conrad Stonebanks, a former co-founder of the Expendables who went rogue and was presumed dead. In the ensuing firefight, The Expendables manage to kill all but Stonebanks, who shoots Caesar twice. As the team attempts to aid him, they are forced to retreat due to Stonebanks' advanced weaponry, and Caesar is severely injured in the process.|$|R
40|$|Drug release, from matrix {{controlled}} release devices, may be activated by the ingress of solvent (water). In {{the case of}} matrix {{controlled release}} devices consisted of a hydrophobic polymer, the water uptake is markedly facilitated {{by the presence of}} osmotically-active excipients, leading thus to the acceleration of the drug release. This acceleration is attributed to excess swelling of the polymer and/or the generation of microscopic cracks, which form a pore network. However, even in this case, the release kinetics deviates from the desired constant dose rate. This work aims at contributing to the optimization of such systems through: i) The experimental study of the variations on the osmotic effect that three water soluble excipients, incorporated in the hydrophobic matrix, produce. ii) The experimental study of the release kinetics of a hydrophilic, biologically active drug in the absence and {{in the presence of the}} aforementioned osmotically active excipients. iii) The study of the role of the water uptake on the release kinetics. iv) The achievement of a constant dose rate of the drug, through the use of a multilayer controlled release device. v) The characterization of the depleted matrices in order to gain insight on the release mechanism of both the dug and the excipients. Mixtures (10 : 1) of components A and B of silicone rubber (SR) (poly(dimethylsiloxane),PDMS) type GE- 615, (GE- Silicones) were gauged by means of a mechanical stirrer at 400 rpm. Silicone rubber films were prepared by casting the mixture on a PE coated plate, by the means of a <b>doctor’s</b> <b>knife.</b> The osmotically active excipients (NaCl, CsNO 3 and CsCl) and the model drug, 7 -(β-Hydroxy-propyl) theophylline (proxyphylline) were added in the two components mixture prior to curing. The crosslinking formation mechanism was studied by means of 1 Η-NMR, 13 C-NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy and the probability of chemical interaction between the components A and B and the excipients was eliminated through experiments conducted by means of differential scanning calorimetry (D. S. C.). The particle sizes were estimated both for the salts (ca. 10 μm) and proxyphylline (ca. 1 μm) by means of optical and scanning electron microscopy (S. E. M.). The films dimensioned 2 x 2 cm 2 and of thicknesses 370 - 420 μm, contained: i) NaCl in five different initial concentrations (0. 02 - 0. 23 v/v) ii) CsNO 3 and CsCl in two different initial concentrations (0. 06 and 0. 12 v/v) iii) proxyphylline in three different initial concentrations (0. 05, 0. 11 and 0. 22 v/v) 169 iv) proxyphylline (0. 11 v/v) in the presence of NaCl (0. 04 - 0. 07 v/v) or CsNO 3 and CsCl (0. 07 v/v). The release experiments were conducted in deionised water, kept under constant temperature, while the amount of release was monitored by means of a conductivity bridge, in the case of salts and by means of a U. V. /Vis spectrophotometer, in the case of proxyphylline. At selected times, the concurrent variation of the water content, was also monitored by weighing the films. In the case of matrices containing exclusively salts, the kinetics did not present any linear parts on a square root time scale, due to the extensive water uptake. Water passes through a maximum, while at the end, the matrices retain a substantial amount of water, which exceeds the volume that the salts initially occupied inside the matrices. In general, the water uptake was increased and the release kinetics was accelerated with increasing amounts of salts. However, in the case of matrices containing NaCl 0. 22 v/v, the release acceleration was not accompanied by significant water uptake. This is attributed to the formation of an intra-connected cavity network inside the matrices, due to the significant initial amount of NaCl. In the case of matrices containing proxyphylline, the water uptake is slow and fairly limited. Matrices containing 0. 05 and 0. 11 v/v proxyphylline, presented similar release kinetics, probably due to the fact, that the drug is mainly diffused through the polymer. The kinetics presented linear parts on a square root time scale, therefore declining rates with time. ...|$|R
