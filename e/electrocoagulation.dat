25|$|Electrochemistry, {{a branch}} of chemistry, went through several changes during its {{evolution}} from early principles related to magnets in the early 16th and 17th centuries, to complex theories involving conductivity, electric charge and mathematical methods. The term electrochemistry was used to describe electrical phenomena in the late 19th and 20th centuries. In recent decades, electrochemistry has become an area of current research, including research in batteries and fuel cells, preventing corrosion of metals, the use of electrochemical cells to remove refractory organics and similar contaminants in wastewater <b>electrocoagulation</b> and improving techniques in refining chemicals with electrolysis and electrophoresis.|$|E
2500|$|Multifocal electroleucoagulation, {{in which}} white matter is {{gradually}} destroyed by passing electric current through electrodes {{implanted in the}} frontal lobes, was the invention of doctors at the Burden Neurological Institute in 1959. Ten sheaths, each containing six or seven electrodes, were implanted {{in the brain and}} connected to a socket on the head. Every week direct currents of 10–20 mA were passed for about 3 minutes through [...] 2–4 selected electrodes to make electrolytic lesions. These experiments continued throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s. In the mid-1990s there were plans to re-introduce multifocal <b>electrocoagulation</b> but they came to nothing.|$|E
2500|$|Appropriately {{applied with}} electro {{surgical}} forceps, desiccation and coagulation {{result in the}} occlusion of blood vessels and halting of bleeding. While the process is technically a process of <b>electrocoagulation,</b> the term [...] "electrocautery" [...] is sometimes loosely, nontechnically and incorrectly used to describe it. The process of vaporization {{can be used to}} ablate tissue targets, or, by linear extension, used to transect or cut tissue. While the processes of vaporization/ cutting and desiccation/coagulation are best accomplished with relatively low voltage, continuous or near continuous waveforms, the process of fulguration is performed with relatively high voltage modulated waveforms. Fulguration is a superficial type of coagulation, typically created by arcing modulated high voltage current to tissue that is rapidly desiccated and coagulated. The continued application of current to this highly impedant tissue results in resistive heating and the achievement of very high temperatures - enough to cause breakdown of the organic molecules to sugars and even carbon, thus the dark textures from carbonization of tissue.|$|E
50|$|A major design {{weakness}} of the <b>electrocoagulation</b> units is the method used in connecting the electrode to the power source. These designs cause overheating resulting in premature failure of the <b>electrocoagulation</b> reaction chamber. VEP reaction chambers are designed to resolve these performance issues by changing all electrode connections from the standard wet connection (inside the chamber) to an external dry connection. The VEP is cooler-operating and has a longer chamber life than an <b>electrocoagulation</b> unit.|$|E

50|$|<b>Electrocoagulation</b> (EC), aka radio {{frequency}} diathermy or short wave electrolysis, {{is a technique}} used for wash water treatment, wastewater treatment, industrial processed water, and medical treatment. <b>Electrocoagulation</b> has become a rapidly growing area of wastewater treatment due to its ability to remove contaminants that are generally more difficult to remove by filtration or chemical treatment systems, such as emulsified oil, total petroleum hydrocarbons, refractory organics, suspended solids, and heavy metals. There are many brands of <b>electrocoagulation</b> devices available and they can range in complexity from a simple anode and cathode to much more complex devices with control over electrode potentials, passivation, anode consumption, cell REDOX potentials {{as well as the}} introduction of ultrasonic sound, ultraviolet light and a range of gases and reactants to achieve so-called Advanced Oxidation Processes for refractory or recalcitrant organic substances.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that <b>electrocoagulation</b> technology cannot remove infinitely soluble matter. Therefore ions with molecular weights smaller than Ca+2 or Mg+2 cannot be dissociated from the aqueous medium.|$|E
50|$|Endoscopic {{techniques}} {{used in the}} treatment include epinephrine injection followed by bipolar or monopolar <b>electrocoagulation,</b> injection sclerotherapy, heater probe, laser photocoagulation, hemoclipping or banding.

50|$|In its {{simplest}} form, an <b>electrocoagulation</b> reactor {{is made up}} of an {{electrolytic cell}} with one anode and one cathode. When connected to an external power source, the anode material will electrochemically corrode due to oxidation, while the cathode will be subjected to passivation.|$|E
50|$|Radiofrequency {{ablation}} is a dermatosurgical procedure {{by using}} {{various forms of}} alternating current. Types of radiofrequency are electrosection, <b>electrocoagulation,</b> electrodessication and fulguration.

5000|$|Mechanical Filtration {{addresses}} {{only two}} issues in wash rack wash water: suspended solids larger than 30 µm, and free {{oil and grease}}. Emulsified oil and grease cause damage to the media filters, resulting in very high maintenance costs. <b>Electrocoagulation</b> addresses any size of suspended solids (including destructive >30 µm particles and heavy metals that can wear-and-tear pressure washers and pose an environmental and employee hazard).|$|E

50|$|A {{variable}} electro-precipitator (VEP) is a {{produced and}} waste water remediation unit using <b>electrocoagulation.</b> The {{difference between a}} standard electro coagulation (EC) unit and a Variable Electro Precipitation unit are in the enhanced flow path and the unit electrode connections.

This design greatly aids in increasing the amount of effective treatment per gallon of water.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electrocoagulation</b> {{offers an}} {{alternative}} to the use of metal salts or polymers and polyelectrolyte addition for breaking stable emulsions and suspensions. The technology removes metals, colloidal solids and particles, and soluble inorganic pollutants from aqueous media by introducing highly charged polymeric metal hydroxide species. These species neutralize the electrostatic charges on suspended solids and oil droplets to facilitate agglomeration or coagulation and resultant separation from the aqueous phase. The treatment prompts the precipitation of certain metals and salts.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{method is}} known as thermolysis, also called radio {{frequency}} (RF), shortwave or diathermy.

A thermolytic hair remover is essentially a radio transmitter, usually with an output of about 0-8 watts at a frequency of 13.56 [...] RF energy emanates from the probe tip to tissue within about a millimeter. Thermolysis works by heating the hair matrix cells to about 48 to 50 C, causing <b>electrocoagulation.</b>|$|E

This technology requires the addition of chemicals resulting in expensive, messy, and labor-intensive treatment. This process also requires addition of compressed air for floatation of coagulated contaminants. Generally filtration is also required as a post-treatment phase for polishing. <b>Electrocoagulation</b> requires no filters, no daily maintenance, no additives, and removes any size of suspended solids, oil, grease and heavy metals.|$|E

5000|$|A round dull {{instrument}} (curette) {{of varying}} sizes (1 mm to 6 mm) {{is used to}} scrape off the cancer down to the dermis. [...] The scraping is then paused while an electrosurgical device like a hyfrecator is used next. <b>Electrocoagulation</b> (electrodesiccation) is performed over the raw surgical ulcer to denature a layer of the dermis and the curette is used again over the surgical ulcer to remove denatured dermis down to living tissue. In the case of skin cancers, the cautery and electrodesiccation is usually performed three times, or until the surgeon is comfortable reasonable margins have been achieved.|$|E
50|$|The goal of {{treatment}} {{is to improve}} the appearance of lesions since they are otherwise not serious and typically do not cause symptoms. Many treatment methods have been attempted however, complete removal is uncommon. No single treatment method has been shown to consistently work. Both medical and surgical treatments have been studied, each with variable success. Common destructive treatment methods include carbon dioxide lasers, dermabrasion, surgical excision, <b>electrocoagulation</b> and chemical peels. Many of these methods are very time consuming and require multiple treatment sessions.Carbon dioxide lasers are the most commonly practiced method; however, can cause thermal damage leading to scarring in the area. Medical therapies include topical atropine, topical retinoids and oral tranilast.|$|E
50|$|The {{facility}} at 815 Mission Rock Road, Santa Paula, provided service to over 30,000 waste generators.

The owner of facility said that they never had a major problem such as this since the plant only takes non-hazardous waste. The capacity of the facility was increased to handle up to 100 gal or 140000 gal by 2014. The facility provides an environmentally safe and legal means of treating, disposing and recycling of contaminated but non-hazardous waste {{as an alternative to}} dumping untreated wastes into municipal sewer systems or into the environment.

5000|$|Sonoelectrochemistry is the {{application}} of ultrasound in electrochemistry. Like sonochemistry, sonoelectrochemistry was discovered in the early 20th century. The effects of power ultrasound on electrochemical systems and important electrochemical parameters were originally demonstrated by Moriguchi and then by Schmid and Ehert [...] when the researchers investigated the influence of ultrasound on concentration polarisation, metal passivation {{and the production of}} electrolytic gases in aqueous solutions. In the late 1950s, Kolb and Nyborg showed that the electrochemical solution (or electroanalyte) hydrodynamics in an electrochemical cell was greatly increased in the presence of ultrasound and described this phenomenon as acoustic streaming. In 1959, Penn et al. demonstrated that sonication had a great effect on the electrode surface activity and electroanalyte species concentration profile throughout the solution. In the early 1960s, the electrochemist Allen J. Bard showed in controlled potential coulometry experiments that ultrasound significantly enhances mass transport of electrochemical species from the bulk solution to the electroactive surface. In the range of ultrasonic frequencies kHz - 2 MHz, ultrasound has been applied to many electrochemical systems, processes and areas of electrochemistry (to name but a few: electroplating, electrodeposition, electropolymerisation, <b>electrocoagulation,</b> organic electrosynthesis, materials electrochemistry, environmental electrochemistry, electroanalytical chemistry, hydrogen energy and fuel cell technology) both in academia and industry, as this technology offers several benefits over traditional technologies. The advantages are as follows: significant thinning of the diffusion layer thickness (δ) at the electrode surface; increase in electrodeposit/electroplating thickness; increase in electrochemical rates, yields and efficiencies; increase in electrodeposit porosity and hardness; increase in gas removal from electrochemical solutions; increase in electrode cleanliness and hence electrode surface activation; lowerering in electrode overpotentials (due to metal depassivation and gas bubble removal generated at the electrode surface induced by cavitation and acoustic streaming); and suppression in electrode fouling (depending on the ultrasonic frequency and power).|$|E

Initially, two electrodes (graphite plate and air cathode) were connected with 0. 5 V of voltage applied for a short charging time (∼ 10 s). The direction of the electric field was then reversed, by switching the power supply lead from the anode to the cathode, and connecting the other lead to a sacrificial aluminum mesh anode for removal of phosphate by <b>electrocoagulation.</b> The performance of this process, called a reverse-electric field, air cathode <b>electrocoagulation</b> (REAEC) reactor, was tested using domestic wastewater {{as a function of}} charging time and <b>electrocoagulation</b> time. REAEC wastewater treatment removed up to 98 % of phosphate in 15 min (inert electrode working time of 10 s, current density of 1 mA/cm 2, and 15 min total <b>electrocoagulation</b> time), which was 6 % higher than that of the control (no inert electrode). The energy demand varied from 0. 05 kWh/m 3 for 85 % removal in 5 min, to 0. 14 kwh/m 3 for 98 % removal in 15 min.

The experimental results showed that ozone assisted <b>electrocoagulation</b> process yielded higher pollutant removal than ozone and <b>electrocoagulation</b> processes alone. Response surface methodology based on central composite design was used to optimize various operating parameters of the ozone assisted <b>electrocoagulation</b> process {{for the treatment of}} industrial effluent. The effects of five independent parameters such as current density(X 1), COD concentration(X 2), effluent pH(X 3), inter-electrode distance(X 4) and electrolysis time(X 5) on the% COD removal and power consumption were investigated. A quadratic model was used to predict the COD removal and power consumption in different conditions. The significance of independent variables and their interaction were evaluated by ANOVA. In order to achieve the maximum COD removal and minimum power consumption, the optimum conditions were obtained by mathematical and statistical methods. The results showed that maximum COD removal efficiency could be achieved at optimum conditions of X 1 − 3 A/dm 2, X 2 − 3000 ppm, X 3 − 7, X 4 − 1. 8 cm and X 5 − 5 h.
