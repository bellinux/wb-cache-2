40|$|Abstract—A {{technique}} for film <b>grain</b> <b>noise</b> extraction, modeling and synthesis is studied {{and applied to}} high-definition video coding in this paper. Film <b>grain</b> <b>noise</b> enhances the natural appearance of pictures in high-definition video and should be preserved in coded video. However, the coding of video contents with film <b>grain</b> <b>noise</b> is expensive. In previous art, it was proposed to enhance the coding performance by extracting film <b>grain</b> <b>noise</b> from the input video at the encoder as a preprocessing step, and by resynthesizing and adding {{it back to the}} decoded video at the decoder as a postprocessing step. In a novel implementation of this approach, we first remove film <b>grain</b> <b>noise</b> from image/video with a variational denoising approach without distorting its original content. Then, we present a parametric model (consisting of a small set of parameters) to generate film <b>grain</b> <b>noise</b> that is close to the actual one in terms of a couple of observed statistical properties, such as the power spectral density and the crosschannel spectral correlation. Under this framework, the coding gain of denoised video is higher while the visual quality of the final reconstructed video is well preserved.

40|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the sensitivity and angular resolution of the Herschel Space Observatory at far-infrared and submm wavelengths, we aim to characterize the physical properties of cold dust within nearby galaxies and study the robustness of the parameters we derive using different modified blackbody models. For a pilot subsample of the KINGFISH program, we perform 2 temperature fits of the Spitzer and Herschel photometric data (24 to 500 um), with a warm and a cold component, globally and in each resolution element. At global scales, we observe ranges of values for beta_c(0. 8 to 2. 5) and Tc(19. 1 to 25. 1 K). We compute maps of our parameters with beta fixed or free to test the robustness of the temperature and dust surface density maps we deduce. When the emissivity is fixed, we observe temperature gradients {{as a function of}} radius. When the emissivity is fitted as a free parameter, barred galaxies tend to have uniform fitted emissivities. Gathering resolved elements in a Tc-beta_c diagram underlines an anti-correlation between the two parameters. It remains difficult to assess whether the dominant effect is the physics of dust <b>grains,</b> <b>noise,</b> or mixing along the line of sight and in the beam. We finally observe in both cases that the dust column density peaks in central regions of galaxies and bar ends (coinciding with molecular gas density enhancements usually found in these locations). We also quantify how the total dust mass varies with our assumptions about the emissivity index as well as the influence of the wavelength coverage used in the fits. We show that modified blackbody fits using a shallow emissivity (beta_c < 2. 0) lead to significantly lower dust masses compared to the beta_c < 2. 0 case, with dust masses lower by up to 50 % if beta_c= 1. 5 for instance.

40|$|Birefringence {{has been}} used to study {{transparent}} materials since 1815, and is based on the decomposition of a polarized ray of light into two distinct rays when passing through an optically anisotropic material. This thesis uses this phenomenon in a study of phase retardation in crystalline materials. Single and multicrystalline silicon was chosen as the model material. Silicon is an interesting and important material in its own right, and the use of photoelasticity to determine stresses at linear and planar defects can have important consequences in the electrical performance of devices such as electronics and photovoltaic cells. This thesis presents the results of an experimental investigation of residual stresses in multicrystalline silicon wafers using near-infrared (NIR) transmission photoelasticity. NIR transmission through multicrystalline silicon is found to vary with crystallographic orientation and relate to planar atomic density, enabling the assignment of appropriate stress-optic coefficients to different <b>grains.</b> <b>Noise</b> in the data is reduced with the Ramji and Ramesh 10 -step phase shifting algorithm when compared to the Patterson and Wang process. Normal stresses at points of zero maximum shear stress can be characterized based on isoclinic behavior around the point. Points at which all normal stresses are zero serve as boundary conditions for shear difference integration and allow for stress separation from a point that is not a free boundary. The second part of this work focuses on residual stresses in silicon wafers subjected to known physical damage such as indentations. Residual stress fields around Vickers indentations in silicon are found to be larger in size than predicted by contact mechanics. Placing Vickers indentations in close proximity creates a secondary stress field surrounding the entire indentation array, and a relationship is developed to explain this behavior. High residual stresses measured at grain boundaries are found to be consistent with models of atomic displacement. Placement of Vickers indentations near grain boundaries results in a change in stress state at the grain boundaries. The results of this study demonstrate the capacity of birefringence as a non-destructive evaluation tool and describe the effects of residual stress concentrations in silicon wafers. Ph. D...|$|R

For a pilot subsample of the KINGFISH (Key Insights on Nearby Galaxies: A Far-Infrared Survey with Herschel) key programme, we perform two-temperature fits of the Spitzer and Herschel photometric data (from 24 to 500 μm), with a warm and a cold component, both globally and in each resolution element. We compare the results obtained from different analysis strategies. At global scale, we observe a range of values of the modified blackbody fit parameters β_c (0. 8 – 2. 5) and T_c (19. 1 – 25. 1 [*]K). We compute maps of our modelling parameters with β_c fixed or treated as a free parameter to test the robustness of the temperature and dust surface density maps we deduce. When the emissivity is fixed, we observe steeper temperature gradients as a function of radius than when it is allowed to vary. When the emissivity is fitted as a free parameter, barred galaxies tend to have uniform fitted emissivities. Gathering the parameters obtained in each resolution element in a T_c–β_c diagram underlines an anticorrelation between the two parameters.
