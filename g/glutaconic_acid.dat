30|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an {{extensively}} investigated yeast due to {{its unique}} features and potential to be applied in biotechnological processes aiming {{for the production of}} a large range of chemical compounds. Among others, the production of biofuels (e.g. ethanol, farnesene, isobutanol), pharmaceutical drugs (e.g. artemisinic acid) and carboxylic acids has received large attention from both academia and industry (Abbott et al. 2009; Borodina and Nielsen 2014; Buijs et al. 2013; Paddon et al. 2013). Since S. cerevisiae is not capable of naturally fermenting d-xylose, considerable research efforts have been invested in the engineering and optimization of d-xylose assimilation pathways based on XR-XDH or XI in S. cerevisiae, in particular for the production of ethanol or acetyl-CoA derived products [see reviews by e.g. (Hahn-Hägerdal et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2013; Van Maris et al. 2007)]. In that context, the Weimberg pathway that converts d-xylose to α-ketoglutarate that enters the metabolism via the TCA cycle could be relevant for the production of carboxylic acids produced or derived from the TCA-cycle. Potential applications for α-ketoglutarate are as a dietary supplement, in medical products, and as a platform chemical for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds (Otto et al. 2011). Importantly, α-ketoglutarate {{can be used as a}} precursor for the production of acids with novel characteristics that are not yet being produced on a large scale, such as glutaric, <b>glutaconic</b> and glutamic <b>acids</b> (Bajaj and Singhal 2011; Djurdjevic et al. 2011; Dutta et al. 2013; Fink 2013; Sailakshmi et al. 2013; Sung et al. 2005). Chemical synthesis of α-ketoglutarate is possible through various routes, but problematic since it is a multi-step reaction partly involving toxic chemicals (Otto et al. 2011). Therefore, more attention is being directed to the biotechnological production of α-ketoglutarate since this constitutes an environmentally friendly alternative (Aurich et al. 2012; Otto et al. 2011).|$|R

40|$|The glutaconic acids {{constitute}} {{a group of}} unsaturated dibasic acids in which geometrical isomerism coexists with that of tautomeric mobility; the latter reaches its maximum in <b>glutaconic</b> <b>acid</b> itself where the three carbon system is activated by two terminal keto-enol systems so the whole is really a heptad system. [diagram] In <b>glutaconic</b> <b>acid</b> the mobility is such that the only one form of the acid, the trans, is stable, although the cis form has been obtained by careful hydration of the anhydride, (Malanchowaki, Ber. 1929, 623, 1323). Introduction of electron releasing groups in the α, and/or β, and/or γ reduces this mobility so {{that in some cases}} most of the theoretically possible forms have been isolated. Modern theory demands that unsymmetrically substituted glutaconic acids should exist in six firms, cis Δαβ, trans Δαβ, d-and 1 -trans Δ βγ and d- and 1 - cisΔβγ due to structural and geometrical and optical isomerism. The optical active forms have not been isolated. However, in symmetrically substituted acids the theoretically possible number of forms is four d- and 1 - cis and d- and 1 - trans, these being due to geometrical and optical isomerism; no structural isomerism resulting from the position of the double bond occurs...|$|E

On the one hand Deist considered that all the properties of these compounds could be completely explained on the basis of a simple geometrical isomerism of the maleic acid – fumaric acid type, while on the other hand, Thorpe postulated a “normal” or symmetrical structure to account for the properties of certain derivatives of <b>glutaconic</b> <b>acid,</b> and he subsequently applied it to all the glutaconic compounds...|$|E
40|$|Glutaric and glutaconic acids {{serve as}} {{monomers}} {{for the production}} of polymers. Glutaric acid (pentanedioic acid) might be used for polyester synthesis, related to the biodegradable Ecoflex available from BASF. <b>Glutaconic</b> <b>acid</b> (pentenedioic acid) could be applied for the formation of polyamides by polymerization with diamines. Furthermore this α,β-unsaturated dicarboxylic acid is suitable for radical polymerization. Therefore we became interested in the biological production of these dicarboxylic acids. The ideal material for biotechnological production of <b>glutaconic</b> <b>acid</b> would be glutamic acid, obtained by sugar fermentation. The chemical deamination of this α-amino acid to glutaconate is not executable. In contrary to this, strictly anaerobic bacteria, as are Acidaminococcus fermentans and Clostridium symbiosum can easily ferment glutamate to ammonia, acetate, butyrate, CO 2 and H 2 via 2 -oxoglutarate, (R) - 2 -hydroxyglutarate, (R) - 2 -hydroxyglutaryl-CoA, and glutaconyl-CoA. Inhibition of the subsequent decarboxylation to crotonyl-CoA would lead to glutaconate. We achieved this aim on another route, the conversion of Escherichia coli into a glutaconate producer by introducing six genes encoding (R) - 2 -hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (HgdH), glutaconate CoA-transferase (GctAB), and the extremely oxygen sensitive activator of the dehydratase (HgdC) from A. fermentans as well as the also oxygen sensitive (R) - 2 -hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase (HgdAB) from C. symbiosum. Hence, within 5 h after induction of gene expression the recombinant E. coli produced 2. 7 ± 0. 2 mM glutaconate on a medium containing 1. 5 % peptone, 0. 3 % yeast extract, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM glucose, 3 mM cysteine, 10 mM glutamate, 2 mM ferric citrate, 0. 2 mM riboflavin, and antibiotics. Interestingly, initially the concentration of glutamate decreased by 30 % but later regained its original level, whereas glucose was almost quantitatively converted to two ethanol. The reduction of glutaconyl-CoA to glutaryl-CoA is catalyzed by an enzyme involved in the synthesis of cyclohexanecarboxylate and benzoate in Syntrophus aciditrophicus. Preliminary experiments indicate that coexpression of the genes encoding glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase and electron-transferring flavoprotein (EtfAB) from S. aciditrophicus in E. coli yield an enzyme system that together with hydrogenase catalyzes the bifurcation of 2 NAD(P) H to glutaconyl-CoA and ferredoxin. Thus glutaryl-CoA and H 2 were formed though at a very low rate...|$|E
40|$|Fumarate, a four-carbon trans dicarboxylic acid, is the {{allosteric}} activator of {{the human}} mitochondrial NAD(P) (+) -dependent malic enzyme (m-NAD(P) -ME). In this paper, we discuss {{the effects of the}} structural analogues of fumarate on human m-NAD(P) -ME. Succinate, a dicarboxylic acid with a carbon-carbon single bond, can also activate the enzyme, but the activating effect of succinate is less than that of fumarate. Succinamide, a diamide of succinate, cannot activate the enzyme and is a poor active-site inhibitor. The cis isomer of fumarate, maleic acid, significantly inhibits the ME activity, suggesting that the trans configuration of fumarate is crucial for operating the allosteric regulation of the enzyme. Other dicarboxylic acids, including <b>glutaconic</b> <b>acid,</b> malonic acid and alpha-ketoglutarate, cannot activate the enzyme and inversely inhibit enzyme activity. Our data suggest that these structural analogues are mainly active-site inhibitors, although they may enter the allosteric site to inhibit the enzyme. Furthermore, these data also suggest that the dicarboxylic acid must be in a trans conformation for allosteric activation of the enzyme. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Oxidation of {{nicotine}} by microorganisms has received increased attention (luring recent years. This attention has stemmed mainly from {{a realization that}} microorganisms play an im-portant role in nicotine disappearance during the "sweating " period of tobacco production. Two approaches have beeni used to study nicotine degradation. One approach was used by Frankenburg et al. (1952 and 1955) who frac-tionated chloroform extracts of cigar tobacco leaves undergoing "sweating. " The various fractions yielded 3 -pyridyl propyl ketone, nicotinamide, N-methylnicotinamide, oxynicotine, nicotinic acid, 3 -pyridyl methyl ketone, 2, 3 '-dipyridyl, and an unidentified pyridine deriva-tive.

40|$|Glutaryl-CoA {{dehydrogenase}} (GCDH) deficiency is an {{autosomal recessive}} disease {{with an estimated}} overall prevalence of 1 in 100 000 newborns.

40|$|Glutaric aciduria type I (synonym, glutaric acidemia type I) {{is a rare}} organic aciduria.

The neuropathological correlate is striatal injury which results from encephalopathic crises precipitated by infectious diseases, immunizations and surgery during a finite period of brain development, or develops insidiously without clinically apparent crises. Glutaric aciduria type I is caused by inherited deficiency of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase which {{is involved in the}} catabolic pathways of L-lysine, L-hydroxylysine and L-tryptophan. This defect gives rise to elevated glutaric acid, 3 -hydroxyglutaric acid, <b>glutaconic</b> <b>acid,</b> and glutarylcarnitine which can be detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (organic acids) or tandem mass spectrometry (acylcarnitines). Glutaric aciduria type I is included in the panel of diseases that are identified by expanded newborn screening in some countries.

Metabolic treatment that includes a low lysine diet, carnitine supplementation and intensified emergency treatment during acute episodes of intercurrent illness should be introduced and monitored by an experienced interdisciplinary team. However, initiation of treatment after the onset of symptoms is generally not effective in preventing permanent damage.
