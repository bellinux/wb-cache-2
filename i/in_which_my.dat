25|$|Herr Prof. Niemetschek's {{biography}} {{so completely}} reanimated my sisterly feelings toward my so ardently beloved brother that I was often dissolved in tears, {{since it is}} only now that I became acquainted with the sad condition <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>my</b> brother found himself.|$|E
25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>my</b> left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E

2500|$|An article which {{appeared}} in The Southeast Missourian discussed that Norton credited Napoleon Hill's philosophy for his success. To quote from the article, [...] "Norton says he's a believer in Napoleon Hill's philosophy, that a person can do anything he puts his mind to.

2500|$|Roubini and {{political}} scientist Ian Bremmer {{have described the}} 21st century world as fragmenting economically {{and political}}ly, where the [...] "old models of understanding global dynamics are struggling" [...] {{to keep up with}} rapid changes. In an article in Foreign Affairs magazine, they describe what they call a [...] "G-Zero world," [...] where the [...] United States no longer has the resources to continue as the primary provider of global public goods. [...] As a result, there is likely to be more conflict than cooperation between countries, creating a [...] "zero-sum game," [...] a [...] "game <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>my</b> win is your loss."

2500|$|He said: [...] "I {{have lived}} into an age <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>my</b> ideas are {{now part of}} common intuition, part of a common fashion. It has been a great experience, having given up so much to find that there is now this range of opinion in all classes, that an {{agreement}} with the EEC is totally incompatible with normal parliamentary government.... The nation has returned to haunt us". When Labour won the 1997 general election, Powell told his wife, Pamela Wilson, [...] "They have voted to break up the United Kingdom." [...] She rejoined the Conservative Party the next day, but he did not. By then, Powell had been hospitalised several times {{as a result of a}} succession of falls.|$|E

2500|$|On 15 April 1918, Maclean {{was arrested}} for sedition. He was refused bail and his trial fixed for 9 May in Edinburgh. He {{conducted}} his own defence in a defiant manner, refusing to plead and {{when asked if he}} objected to any of the jurors replying, [...] "I object to the whole lot of them." [...] The prosecution case was based on the testimony of witnesses who had attended his meetings, who quoted extracts from his speeches using notes they had written up from memory after the meeting. Maclean objected to his words being taken out of context, saying. [...] "The main parts of my speech, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>my</b> themes are developed are omitted. I want to expose the trickery of the British government and their police and their lawyers." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Cave was 9 {{he joined}} the choir of Wangaratta’s Holy Trinity Cathedral. At 13 he was {{expelled}} from Wangaratta High School. In 1970, having moved {{with his family to}} the Melbourne suburb of Murrumbeena, he became a boarder and later day student at Caulfield Grammar School. He was 19 when his father was killed in a car accident; his mother told him of his father's death while she was bailing him out of a St Kilda police station where he was being held on a charge of burglary. He would later recall that his father [...] "died at a point in my life when I was most confused" [...] and that [...] "the loss of my father created in my life a vacuum, a space <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>my</b> words began to float and collect and find their purpose".|$|E
2500|$|In 1856, Semmelweis's {{assistant}} Josef Fleischer {{reported the}} successful results of hand washing activities at St. Rochus and Pest maternity {{institutions in the}} Viennese Medical Weekly (Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift). The editor remarked sarcastically {{that it was time}} people stopped being misled about the theory of chlorine washings. Two years later, Semmelweis finally published his own account of his work in an essay entitled [...] "The Etiology of Childbed Fever". Two years later, he published a second essay, [...] "The Difference in Opinion between Myself and the English Physicians regarding Childbed Fever". In 1861, Semmelweis finally published his main work Die Ätiologie, der Begriff und die Prophylaxis des Kindbettfiebers (German for [...] "The Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever"). In his 1861 book, Semmelweis lamented the slow adoption of his ideas: [...] "Most medical lecture halls continue to resound with lectures on epidemic childbed fever and with discourses against my theories. [...] In published medical works my teachings are either ignored or attacked. The medical faculty at Würzburg awarded a prize to a monograph written in 1859 <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>my</b> teachings were rejected".|$|E

2500|$|In September 2006, Watson flew to Los Angeles {{to record}} his album That's Life. On the flight, {{he told his}} {{producer}} that he was experiencing terrible pressure inside his skull. When they landed, his producer suggested a game of tennis to clear his head. Watson {{could not see the}} ball at all. After a visit to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and an MRI scan, he was advised that he had a developing pituitary adenoma, which was the size of two golf balls. According to Watson, [...] "Since an early age I've had an in-built premonition, a vision that I wouldn't make 40. For the previous seven years I'd have a recurring nightmare <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>my</b> head exploded. And here I was with a brain tumour on the eve of my 40th birthday; I thought, 'This is it, I was right, I knew it'." [...] Watson recalled that the tumours were [...] "like a figure of eight, one filling the frontal cavity of my skull, the other forced through into the top of my nose." [...] He stayed in Los Angeles for two days and continued recording his album while tests confirmed whether the tumour was malignant or not – {{it turned out to be}} benign.|$|E
2500|$|On August 7, 2009 Palin {{released}} a statement on her Facebook page in which she said, [...] "The America I know and love is not one <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>my</b> parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have {{to stand in front}} of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care." [...] The Associated Press reported: [...] "Palin and other critics are wrong." [...] The provision of the health care bill to which Palin referred (on page 425) merely authorizes Medicare reimbursement for physicians who provide voluntary counseling about such subjects as living wills. Howard Dean, the former Chair of the Democratic National Committee, said that Palin [...] "just made that up. Just like the 'Bridge to Nowhere' that she supposedly didn't support." [...] Republicans were divided. Former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich agreed with Palin, saying that [...] "there are clearly people in America who believe in establishing euthanasia, including selective standards." [...] Palin's [...] "death panels" [...] comment was selected as the [...] "Lie of the Year" [...] by PolitiFact.com, the fact-checking website of the St. Petersburg Times. Palin was also criticized for having invoked her infant for political purposes.|$|E
