The morphology of the OMMT nanoparticles was observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy. The exfoliated OMMT nanoparticles consisted of several parallel MMT layers and presented disordered and <b>floccule</b> morphology. Mechanical tests showed that the tensile stress, elongation at break, and tearing strength were improved with increasing OMMT content, whereas the {{tensile strength at break}} slightly decreased.

Clays were flocculated in the laboratory in both distilled water and slightly saline (1 g/l. NaCI) water using various clay concentrations. <b>Floccules</b> taken from the moist clay mass were prepared for study by freeze-drying and impregnation with polyethylene glycol. There is little difference in the fabric of kaolinite flocculated in distilled or slightly saline water. The fabric is dominated by a 3 -dimensional network of twisted chains of face-face oriented flakes having the appearance of a stair-stepped cardhouse. Illite <b>floccules</b> in distilled water also consist of abundant face-face oriented overlapping flakes. However, in salt water there is a more even mixture of fabrics-edge-to-face flooculation of individual platelets and also stepped clusters of face-to-face oriented flakes, the latter being more abundant. It is suggested that under the experimental conditions the double layer of each clay panicle is compressed resulting in an increase in the importance of van der Waals forces of attraction. As a result flakes approach each other and rotate into a parallel or subparallel position. The resultant dominant fabric is that of a stepped cluster of overlapping flakes...|$|R

40|$|Byssinosis, a {{lung disease}} {{that can affect}} cotton mill workers, may be caused in part by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Gram {{negative}} bacteria. In vitro, LPS complexes with sheep lung surfactant (SLS). To determine whether LPS in extracts of cotton dust alters the biophysical characteristics of lung surfactant, aqueous extracts (1. 0 % w:v) of sterile surgical cotton (SSC) and a bulk raw cotton dust (1182 DB) were prepared. Aliquots of the soluble extracts were incubated with SLS and studied by sucrose gradient centrifugation, surface tension analysis, and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The chromatography was employed to analyse for 3 -hydroxymyristate (3 -HM), a fatty acid indicating LPS. Also, purified Enterobacter agglomerans LPS and 3 -HM as controls and as mixtures with SLS, were studied by HPLC. Sucrose gradient centrifugation showed that SLS-SSC, SLS- 1182 DB, and the SLS control had similar densities that differed from the remaining controls. The SLS- 1182 DB exhibited a <b>floccule</b> absent in the other samples. Surface tension values of SLS-SSC and SLS- 1182 DB differed significantly from all controls but only slightly from one another. 3 -Hydroxymyristate was detected by HPLC in the 3 -HM control, EA-LPS, SLS-EA-LPS, and SLS- 1182 DB, but not in SLS-SSC or the remaining controls. Apparently, 3 -HM was below the HPLC detection range in SSC. The data indicate that LPS in the 1182 DB, SSC and EA-LPS samples complexed with SLS. <b>Floccule</b> development in SLS- 1182 DB but not in SLS-EA-LPS suggests a further component(s) present in the bulk raw cotton dust, as well as LPS, which complexes with SLS.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{theoretically}} explores sediment fluxes of high-density mud suspensions {{across the}} seafloor {{under the assumption}} that the dispersions received their entire sediment load from local resuspension of surface mud. Flocculation is ignored, and a constant maximum <b>floccule</b> size is prescribed. The resultant sediment-flux equation, which constitutes a bottom-boundary condition for use in suspended-sediment models, has important physical implications. First, this study identifies a condition, referred to as gelling ignition, in which sediment concentrations will increase to extremely large values owing to a positive feedback between net erosion and hindered settling. Remarkably, this work reveals that, owing to boundary-layer dynamics, mud suspensions of both low and high concentrations are easier to keep in suspension than those of intermediate concentrations. Wave conditions in which high concentrations are produced in the model are within the realm of those typical of storms on shelves. On a sloping shelf, these highly concentrated suspended mud layers would be driven down slope by gravity, and thus represent a possible mechanism for cross-shelf transport...|$|E
30|$|Using SEM/field-emission SEM {{methods to}} {{determine}} porosities {{of a range}} of shale, Slatt and O’Brian (2011) and Slatt et al. (2013) reported that micropores (> 1  µm in pore length and nanopores (< 1  µm) are subequal. The micropores are commonly porous <b>floccules</b> (clumps of electrostatically charged clay flakes arranged in edge–face or edge–edge card house structure) of up to 10  µm in diameter, which are not often seen or identified in ion-milled shale surfaces, perhaps due to the collapse of <b>floccules</b> during milling (Slatt et al. 2013). For the Eagle Ford shale with a high carbonate content, Slatt et al. (2012) reported the presence of μm-sized pore types from coccospheres (internal chambers and hollow spines are up to 1  μm in diameter and several μm in length) and foraminifera (their internal chambers can be 10  μm in diameter). Our MICP analyses, performed on individual 1  cm sized cubes, observed appreciable μm-sized pores, with > 1  μm sized pores account for 10  %– 20  % for American and Chinese shales studied in this work.|$|R
30|$|Notably, YNP/GBS {{photosynthetic}} mats are {{teeming with}} life. Their relatively low temperatures make them suitable for grazing by {{insects and arachnids}} and intrusion by mammals, {{all of which are}} potential vectors for transporting mat <b>floccules</b> between proximal hot springs. The idea that eukaryotes simply don’t survive above ~ 56 °C is a misnomer; transient interactions between macroscopic life and high temperature hot springs are easily observed in the field (perhaps most identifiably among insects and vertebrates including Home sapiens). Chemotrophic communities thrive at temperatures that do rapidly dissuade or sterilize these macroscopic vectors, and their propagation is likely more dependent on non-biological (e.g. Aeolian, climatic, groundwater) mechanisms for surface and subsurface transport and migration. These observations are consistent both with the decreased frequency of low Ks values among chemotroph communities (Fig.  3) {{as well as with the}} potential for vectors to carry mat <b>floccules</b> across long distances. The additional requirement that communities are transported between physico-chemically compatible environments is exactly consistent with the low probability/long distance requirement of jump diffusion models.|$|R

40|$|The {{flocculation}} {{efficiency of}} polyaluminum chloride (PAC) {{is closely related}} to the distribution and structure of its Al species, and Al- 13 is the optimal species in PAC for flocculation. A series of PAC containing Ca was prepared by adding Ca before and after the basifying reaction. The effects of Ca on the Al species were studied by (27) Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and atomic force microscope (AFM) techniques. The experimental results show that the introduction of Ca increases the content of Al-m and Al- 13 in PAC and decreases their chemical shifts in NMR spectra due to the electric repulsion between the positive Ca species and Al species and the formation of Al-O-Ca complexes. With the rise of Ca/Al molar ratio, the Al species in PAC tend to scatter. It is observed that the formerly branch-aggregated clusters are tending to form granule-aggregated ones whose diameter gets smaller and smaller, and the <b>floccule</b> aggregates are formed at a higher Ca/Al molar ratio. The introduction of Ca to PAC, which increases the Al- 13 content, is certainly to enhance the flocculation efficiency of PAC in water treatment...|$|E

We thus investigated whether BMSCs expressing exogenous IL- 4 could alleviate autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss. BMSCs isolated from guinea pigs were transfected with recombinant lentivirus expressing IL- 4. A total of 33 animals were divided into three groups. Group A received scala tympani injection of IL- 4 -expressing BMSCs, and Group B received control vector-expressing BMSCs, and Group C received phosphate-buffered saline.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether the abnormal serum factors of acquired hemolytic anemia in patients with leukemia and lymphoma could be characterized as antibody by the immune adherence technique. The patho-genesis of this disorder has not been completely explained and it was felt that the study of specific immunologic reactions might help to determine whether these serum factors are erythrocyte anti-body. The technique of immune adherence (1, 2) was used not only because its flexibility and sensi-tivity make it most suitable for the study of anti-gen-antibody reactions but particularly because, insofar as is at present known, immune adherence will not occur unless antigen and specific comple-ment-fixing antibody are present. The basic premise of this reaction states that in the presence of antigen, specific antibody, complement, and indicator (either primate red cells or nonprimate platelets), the antigen will adhere to the indicator particles. Immune adherence may be determined either macroscopically by red cell <b>floccule</b> forma-tion or microscopically by dark-field illumination. METHODS AND MATERIALS A.

40|$|Abstract. Due to the {{large-scale}} violent circumfluence {{occurred in the}} traditional electro-floatation (TEF), the interference to the mixture of micro-bubbles and <b>floccules</b> should not be neglected in the floatation. In this paper, the Pulsing Electro-Floatation (PEF) using square wave impulse direct current has been presented. The circumfluence in the inhomogeneous field of the PEF would be gentler than TEF, and the energy utilization rate would be improved. Based the theory of multiphase flow continuous medium, the conservation of momentum equation in the inhomogeneous flow field of PEF has been obtained, and liquid-bubble flow field of the PEF has been simulated using the Fluent module of the ANSYS 13. 0. The research result shows that the inhomogeneous flow field in PEF has more reasonable energy distribution, less extent of circumfluence {{in the process of}} the micro-bubbles floating, and more benefit for the development and floatation of the bubbles-floccules mixture compared with the TEF. With the same current density, the energy consumption of PEF is 1 / 4 - 1 / 3 that of TEF, but has the similar floatation effect with TEF.

40|$|By {{comparing}} the original particle gradation of sediment from the Three Gorges Reservoir {{with the single}} particle gradation, the differences in these two particle gradations showed that there is sediment flocculation in the Three Gorges Reservoir, which can accelerate the sediment deposition rate in the reservoir. In {{order to determine the}} influence of flocculation on the sediment settling velocity, sediment was collected at the Three Gorges Reservoir, and the indoor quiescent settling experiment was performed to study the mechanism of sediment flocculation. The experimental results showed that sediments aggregated from single particles into <b>floccules</b> in the settling processes. The single particles smaller than 0. 022 mm will participate in the formation of <b>floccules,</b> which accounts for 83 % of the total amount of sediment in the Three Gorges Reservoir. Moreover, the degree of sediment flocculation and the increase in sediment settling velocity were directly proportional to the sediment concentration. Taking the average particle size and the median particle size as the representative particle size, respectively, the maximum flocculation factors were calculated to be 3. 4 and 5. 0. Due to the sediment flocculation, the volume of sediment deposition will increase by 66 % when the mass settling flux factor of total sediment had a maximum value of 1. 66, suggesting that flocculation has a significant influence on the sediment deposition rate in the Three Gorges Reservoir...|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} {{experimental}} data showing {{the magnetic field}} distribution in the hydrocyclone working chamber according to radius and height have been presented. One {{of the most important}} parameter of magnetic hydrocyclones is the distribution of the magnetic field along the radius and height of the working chamber necessary to calculate the coagulation and magnetic forces that act on the particle or the flocculation. The magnetic field intensity has been calculated by the magnetic intensity measured by the magnetometer at regular intervals and with different values of DC supply. The resulting values of the magnetic intensity have been presented in graphs. Data that show the distribution of the magnetic field in the hydrocyclone working chamber are the same as those published in domestic and foreign scientific journals. There are several data points that do not fit in the relationship caused by non-ideal manufacturing apparatus and the procedure measuring the magnetic field. Field distribution curves received by the previously found dependencies have been constructed; correlation coefficients have been calculated and proved that analyzed dependence can be used in further calculations forces coagulation and magnetic force as theoretical and experimental data are in good agreement. In most of the hydrocyclone height the field can be considered constant by height and radius and sufficient for the coagulation of the magnetic particles. The change of the magnetic field has been considered where the outer part of the magnetic circuit is not formed whole but in the form of vertical strips.

The gasification process of the nanocomposite samples at an external radiant flux of 50 kW/m 2 {{in a nitrogen atmosphere}} was observed, and the residues collected at various sample mass losses were analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction to determine the content of the residue and to understand the FR mechanism of the nanocomposites. The analysis of the floccules of blackened residues shows that up to 80 % by mass of the residues consists of clay particles and the remainder is thermally stable organic components with possible graphitic structure. Furthermore, clay particles are stacked in the carbonaceous <b>floccule</b> residues and the d-spacing of the clay platelets is in the range of 1. 3 – 1. 4 nm as compared to the well exfoliated original sample. The accumulation of the initially well-dispersed clay particles in the sample on the burning/gasifying sample surface are due to two possible mechanisms. One is recession of the polymer resin from the surface by pyrolysis with the de-wetted clay particles left behind. Another mechanism is the transportation of clay particles pushed by numerous rising bubbles of degradation products and the associated convection flow in the melt from the interior of the sample toward the sample surface. Numerous rising bubbles may have another effect on the transport of clay particles. Bursting of the bubbles at the sample surface pushes the accumulated clay particles outward from the bursting area and forms the island-like floccules instead of forming a continuous net-like structure of a clay filled protective layer.

A cell-free system derived from Streptococcus faecalis was resistant to high concentrations of toxin. Dialyzed toxin-antitoxin <b>floccules</b> that are formed {{in the presence of}} NAD and the 105, 000 × g supernatant fluid from rat liver contain NAD. Such <b>floccules</b> are also active in protein synthesis in the absence of added transferase I or II.

Second, the stereospecific alteration in transferase I, but it does not result in an inactive complex. Second, the stereospecific alteration in transferase II caused by the binding of diphtheria toxin allows NAD to bridge between transferase I and II, which then results in an inactivated complex. The sensitivity of the cell-free system derived from the normally resistant rat implies that in some cells the cell membrane serves as a permeability barrier to the toxin molecule.

The results obtained for CH, CH show that the mechanism considered does not lead to absurd results under the conditions assumed. The importance of at high densities is also discussed. Chapter II deals with a theory of star formation in a medium composed of randomly moving cloudlets or <b>floccules.</b> An outline is given of a recent paper by McCrea who shows that this idea leads to a satisfactory account of the formation of the solar system and removes the angular momentum difficulty of other star formation theories. The collisions of <b>floccules</b> are considered in detail and a theory of the gravitational capture of the fragments of collision is outlined. The expansion of a fully ionised gas into avacuum is discussed in Chapter III. This problem is connected with a recent theory of galaxy formation. The expansion of a monatomic gas and Lagrange's Ballistic problem are first considered. The latter leads to a new model for a freely expanding gas. It is then shown that, if the fully ionised gas remains neutral, by suitably defining the sound speed the equations for a fully ionised gas may be reduced to those for a monatomic gas.

It has been developed as a sustainable technology for ammonia removal from wastewater in the last decade. For wastewater treatment, anammox biomass was widely developed as microbial aggregate where the conditions for enrichment of anammox community must be delicately controlled and growth of other bacteria especially NOB should be suppressed to enhance nitrogen removal efficiency. Little {{is known about the}} distribution of microbial aggregates in anammox process. Thus the objective of our study was to assess whether segregation of biomass occurs in granular anammox system. In this study, a laboratory-scale sequential batch reactor (SBR) was successfully operated for a period of 80 days with granular anammox biomass. Temporal and spatial distribution of microbial aggregates was studied by particle characterization system and the distribution of functional microbial communities was studied with qPCR and 16 s rRNA amplicon pyrosequencing. Our study revealed the spatial and temporal distribution of biomass aggregates based on their sizes and density. Granules (> 200 μm) preferentially accumulated {{in the bottom of the}} reactor while <b>floccules</b> (30 - 200 μm) were relatively rich at the top layer. The average density of aggregate was higher at the bottom than the density of those at the top layer.

NOB was relatively rich in the top layer while percentage of anammox population was higher at the bottom, and anammox bacteria population gradually increased over a period of time. NOB growth was supposed to be associated with the increase of <b>floccules</b> based on the concurrent occurrence.

Sears (6) says, 2 ̆ 2 It is a safe rule to use the mildest treatment which will completely loosen all pollen from the <b>floccules.</b> 2 ̆ 2 This problem of technique is as old as the study of fossil pollen, but we recognize introduced errors more keenly as time goes on. Before presenting the new method for separation of peat, it seems well to outline briefly the procedure in the more common present methods and point out some of the errors they introduce into the observations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Electrophoretic {{mobility}} of imogolite {{has been reported}} as positive (migration toward the negative lectrode) below pH 9, and zero above pH 9. However, when {{mobility of}} dilute imogolite suspensions (5 x 10 a kg/m 3) was measured, it {{was found to be}} negative above pH 9. The reason that imogolite does not behave as a negative colloid when the clay concentration is not very dilute is because the imogolite forms <b>floccules</b> large enough to prevent migration. Imogolite has a PZNC at about pH 6, and has a PZC at pH 8. 5 - 9. 0 showing a relatively low absolute mobility under alkaline conditions compared to that under acid conditions. The fact that imogolite behaves like this is understandable given the location of negative charge appearing on the inside surface of the thin fibrous tube, according to the structural model of imogolite...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A novel {{copolymer}} PADA {{which has}} two functions of flocculation and surface activity was synthesized in aqueous solution. The copolymer {{was applied to}} filtration aiding on wet-process phosphoric acid (WPA). The results show that PADA can increase the filtration rate of the phosphoric acid slurry and decrease the moisture of the filter cake. The mechanism of filtration aiding was studied. PADA neutralizes the surface potential of the phosphogypsum and makes the microcrystal particles flocculate to conglobation, which indicate that electrostatic neutralization and flocculation might be the action modes {{in the process of}} filtration aiding. The shortest flocculation time and largest average diameter of <b>floccules</b> can be obtained with the addition of 10 ppm PADA. The average pore size and porosity of the filter cake are enlarged by 0. 22 µm and 15. 38 % respectively with the addition of PADA. The surface contact angle of the phosphogypsum is increased by 3. 4 ° with PADA presence...|$|R
40|$|Fluvial {{dissolved}} Fe concentrations decrease upon {{mixing with}} seawater, {{resulting in the}} formation of Fe-floccules. However, a clear understanding of the fate of these <b>floccules</b> has yet to be established. Assessing how tidal processes affect the formation of Fe-colloids in the Leirárvogur estuary, SW Iceland, is an important step in understanding the formation and potential deposition of estuarine Fe-rich minerals within this estuarine system. The Leirárvogur estuary drains predominately Fe-rich basalt, increasing the likelihood of detecting changes in Fe-phases. Fluvial waters and local lake waters that drain into the estuary were compared and the effects of seasonal changes were considered, in an attempt to understand how varying end-members and external factors play a role in Fe-rich mineral formation. Aqueous and colloidal Fe concentrations were found to be greater towards the head of the Leirárvogur estuary, suggesting that potential Fe-rich minerals and complexes are forming at sites of fluvial input. Increasing suspended colloidal Fe towards the estuary mouth suggests that Fe-colloids are readily transported seaward...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrophilic}} flocculation of pyrite fines in aqueous suspensions {{with corn}} starch was studied by measuring particle size distribution, microscopy observation and micro-flotation. Furthermore, {{the interaction of}} corn starch with pyrite was investigated by determining the adsorption density and based on zeta potential measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) analysis in this work. The results of the particle size distribution measurement show that corn starch can effectively aggregate pyrite fines, and the pyrite <b>floccules</b> (flocs) are sensitive to mechanical stirring. The micro-flotation {{results suggest that the}} mechanical entrainment of pyrite fines in flotation can be effectively eliminated through the formation of large-size flocs. The zeta potential of pyrite particles decreases with the addition of corn starch. The XPS results prove that carboxyl groups are generated on the digested corn starch, and both iron hydroxyl compounds and ferrous disulfide on the pyrite surface can chemically interact with the corn starch digested by sodium hydroxide...|$|R
