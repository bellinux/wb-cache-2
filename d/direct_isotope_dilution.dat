The test material used in this exercise was baby food formula purchased in a local pharmacy and prepared by the Reference Material Unit of the IRMM for this exercise. Each participant received one bottle containing approximately 15 g of test material. Thirty five laboratories from 26 countries registered to the exercise and all of them reported results. Participants were asked to analyse the measurands in the powder and in the reconstituted form (powder diluted with water, 1 : 8 fold, to mimic the product as consumed). The assigned value for total Cd was determined by LGC Ltd (UK) and IRMM using <b>direct</b> <b>isotope</b> <b>dilution</b> inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The assigned value for total Pb was determined at IRMM using the same technique as for Cd. The standard deviation for proficiency assessment was set at 22 % of the assigned value based on the modified Horwitz equation. Laboratories were rated with z- and ζ-scores (zeta-scores) in accordance with ISO 13528. The outcome of this exercise is clearly influenced by the very low level of Cd and Pb content in the test material which triggered: - a high number of "less than" values; - overestimated values especially for lead very likely due to contamination. Reported results were satisfactory for total cadmium in both forms, (powder and in the reconstituted formula). JRC. D. 5 -Food Safety and Qualit...|$|E
40|$|The {{cadmium content}} in surface water is {{regulated}} by the last European Water Framework Directive to a maximum between 0. 08 and 0. 25 μg L - 1 depending on the water type and hardness. Direct measurement of cadmium at this low level is not straightforward in real samples, and we hereby propose a validated method capable of addressing cadmium content below μg L- 1 level in natural water. It is based on solid-phase extraction using TiO 2 nanoparticles as solid sorbent (0. 05 g packed in mini-columns) to allow the separation and preconcentration of cadmium from the sample, combined to <b>direct</b> <b>isotope</b> <b>dilution</b> and detection by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ID-ICP-MS). The extraction setup is miniaturised and semi-automated to reduce risks of sample contamination and improve reproducibility. Procedural blanks for the whole measurement process were 5. 3 ± 2. 8 ng kg- 1 (1 s) for 50 g of ultrapure water preconcentrated ten times. Experimental conditions influencing the separation (including loading pH, sample flow rates, and acid concentration in the eluent) were evaluated. With isotope dilution the Cd recovery rate {{does not have to}} be evaluated carefully. Moreover, the mathematical model associated to IDMS is known, and provides transparency for the uncertainty propagation. Our validation protocol was in agreement with guidelines of the ISO/IEC 17025 standard (chapter 5. 4. 5). Firstly, we assessed the experimental factors influencing the final result. Secondly, we compared the isotope ratios measured after our separation procedure to the reference values obtained with a different protocol for the digested test material IMEP- 111 (mineral feed). Thirdly, we analysed the certified reference material BCR- 609 (groundwater). Finally, combined uncertainties associated to our results were estimated according to ISO-GUM guidelines (typically, 3 - 4 % k = 2 for a cadmium content of around 100 ng kg - 1). We applied the developed method to the groundwater and wastewater samples ERM-CA 615 and BCR- 713, respectively, and results agreed with certificate values within uncertainty statements.
