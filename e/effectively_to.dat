Species-rich grassland, such as that found at Whitton Bridge, requires careful management for it to retain its high species diversity.

5|$|In 356 BC, Philip then besieged and {{captured}} Potidea, thus marking {{the beginning of}} true hostilities with Athens. As promised, he handed Potidea over to the Olynthians, and let the Athenian garrison depart freely back to Athens, since {{he did not want}} to cause undue offence to the Athenians ("he was particularly solicitous toward the people of Athens on account of the importance and repute of their city"). The Athenians were by this time fully engaged in fighting the Social War, and were unable to respond <b>effectively</b> <b>to</b> Philip's moves against Potidea and Pydna.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Euler {{was asked}} to tutor Friederike Charlotte of Brandenburg-Schwedt, the Princess of Anhalt-Dessau and Frederick's niece. Euler wrote over 200 letters {{to her in the}} early 1760s, which were later {{compiled}} into a best-selling volume entitled Letters of Euler on different Subjects in Natural Philosophy Addressed to a German Princess. This work contained Euler's exposition on various subjects pertaining to physics and mathematics, as well as offering valuable insights into Euler's personality and religious beliefs. This book became more widely read than any of his mathematical works, and was published across Europe and in the United States. The popularity of the 'Letters' testifies to Euler's ability to communicate scientific matters <b>effectively</b> <b>to</b> a lay audience, a rare ability for a dedicated research scientist.|$|E

5|$|When Hitler {{was named}} {{chancellor}} of Germany in January 1933, Göring was appointed as minister without portfolio, Minister of the Interior for Prussia, and Reich Commissioner of Aviation. Wilhelm Frick was named Reich Interior Minister. Frick {{and head of}} the Schutzstaffel (SS) Heinrich Himmler hoped to create a unified police force for all of Germany, but Göring on 30 November 1933 established a Prussian police force, with Rudolf Diels at its head. The force was called the Geheime Staatspolizei, or Gestapo. Göring, thinking that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo <b>effectively</b> <b>to</b> counteract the power of the SA, handed over control of the Gestapo to Himmler on 20 April 1934. By this time, the SA numbered over two million men.|$|E
5|$|As Khalid was the {{architect}} {{of most of the}} early Muslim military doctrines, he was also the pioneer of almost every major tactic that Muslims used during Early Islamic conquests. One of Khalid's major achievements in this context was utilizing the individual skills of Arab Bedouin warriors to a larger scale. He is believed to have developed them into an almost regular unit called Mubarizun ("champions"), who would issue personal challenges to the enemy officers. These were highly trained and skilled swordsmen, whom Khalid utilized <b>effectively</b> <b>to</b> slay as many enemy officers as possible, giving a psychological blow to enemy morale. The Battle of Ajnadayn is perhaps the best example of this form of psychological warfare. Moreover, his biggest achievement was the conversion of Arab tactical doctrine into a strategic system. Until Khalid, the Arabs were basically raiders and skirmishers. Khalid turned those skirmishing tactics into something that could be used anywhere. Thus he would skirmish the enemy to death: he would bring his army in front of his enemies and wait until the whole battle degenerated into a skirmishing affair between small units. Then, after exhausting the enemy units, he would launch his cavalry at their flanks employing Hammer and Anvil tactics.|$|E

In the present, Oliver and Roy Harper locate {{the home of}} Digger Harkness, the boomerang-wielding murderer, where they find A.R.G.U.S. operatives looking for him as well. Caitlin Snow and Cisco Ramon arrive in Starling City to help Felicity Smoak investigate Sara Lance's death. Digger attempts to kill Lyla Michaels, Roy, and Oliver, but Barry arrives and stops him. Later, Lyla reveals Digger {{was part of the}} Suicide Squad. When Oliver uses extreme interrogation methods against a Russian mob member in order to locate Digger, Barry questions how emotionally stable Oliver is. Digger locates Oliver's hideout and wounds Lyla before escaping. In order to leave town, Digger plants five bombs around the city. While Oliver captures Digger, Barry uses both of their teams to defuse the bombs simultaneously. Digger is incarcerated on the island with Slade Wilson. Before Barry and his team's departure, he and Oliver decide to have a friendly duel.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines {{were unable}} to respond <b>effectively</b> <b>to</b> the Muslim advance in Africa, because the two decades between 695 and 715 were a period of great {{domestic}} turmoil. They did react with raids of their own in the East, {{such as the one}} in 709 against Egypt which captured the local admiral, but they also were aware of a coming onslaught: as Caliph al-Walid I (705–715) readied his forces for a renewed assault against Constantinople, Emperor Anastasios II (713–715) prepared the capital, and mounted an unsuccessful pre-emptive strike against the Muslim naval preparations. Anastasios was soon overthrown by Theodosius III (715–717), who in turn was replaced, just as the Muslim army was advancing through Anatolia, by Leo III the Isaurian (717–741). It was Leo III who faced the second and final Arab siege of Constantinople. The use of Greek fire, which devastated the Arab fleet, was again instrumental in the Byzantine victory, while a harsh winter and Bulgar attacks further sapped the besiegers' strength.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{belief in}} the Mandate of Heaven granted to the ailing Tang was also {{challenged}} when natural calamities occurred, forcing many to believe the Heavens were displeased and that the Tang had lost their right to rule. Then in 873 a disastrous harvest shook {{the foundations of the}} empire; in some areas only half of all agricultural produce was gathered, and tens of thousands faced famine and starvation. In the earlier period of the Tang, the central government was able to meet crises in the harvest, as it was recorded from 714–719 that the Tang government responded <b>effectively</b> <b>to</b> natural disasters by extending the price-regulation granary system throughout the country. The central government was able then to build a large surplus stock of foods to ward off the rising danger of famine and increased agricultural productivity through land reclamation. In the 9th century, however, the Tang government was nearly helpless in dealing with any calamity.|$|E

5|$|The SS {{established}} {{a police state}} within Nazi Germany, using the secret state police and security forces under Himmler's control to suppress resistance to Hitler. In his role as Minister President of Prussia, Hermann Göring had in 1933 created a Prussian secret police force, the Geheime Staatspolizei or Gestapo, and appointed Rudolf Diels as its head. Concerned that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo <b>effectively</b> <b>to</b> counteract {{the power of the}} SA, Göring handed over its control to Himmler on 20 April 1934. Also on that date, in a departure from long-standing German practice that law enforcement was a state and local matter, Hitler appointed Himmler chief of all German police outside Prussia. Himmler named his deputy and protégé Reinhard Heydrich chief of the Gestapo on 22 April 1934. Heydrich also continued as head of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD; security service).|$|E
