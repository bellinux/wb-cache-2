However, the producers hardened their stand and insisted that they would not engage any technician or worker associated with FEFSI. They complained that the rising wages of technical staff and artistes were contributing towards the box office run of Tamil films in 1997. They demanded that workers and technicians form new organisations exclusively for the production of Tamil films, on the lines of organisations in Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. The issue escalated when the organisation's leader Vijayan declined to budge from his demands and was able failed to gather support from a series of prominent actors and film director Bharathiraja.vijayan also became the key person for the strike which led to suicide of some members and some lost their asserts due to this strike.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we attempt to}} show that the {{necessary}} condition to create a lightning ground flash is the generation of a vertical conducting channel below the main negative charge centre. The probability of such an event increases if frequent breakdown takes place between the negative charge centre and the lower positive charge centre (LPCC). Analysis of electromagnetic field signatures produced by ground flashes in Sweden show pronounced radiation during the preliminary breakdown process. Such strong pulses are rarely found in tropical thunderstorms in Sri Lanka. We attribute these signatures to preliminary breakdown between the main negative charge centre and the LPCC and argue that meteorological conditions which favour the production of strong LPCC’s {{are more likely to be}} found at mid and high latitudes than in the tropics, thus explaining why there is a greater probability of lightning <b>flashes</b> <b>striking</b> the ground in these regions. 1...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{fights for}} a $ 15 -an-hour minimum wage at Walmart {{and in the}} {{fast-food}} industry have interested academics, captivated the press, and energized the public. For good reason. The campaigns upend conventional wisdom about what unions do (help workers win collective bargaining rights) and why they do it (build the membership). Scattered <b>flash</b> <b>strikes</b> for seemingly impossible or idiosyncratic goals on no obvious timeline have shattered that mold. Though much has already been said about these developments, scholarship has yet to provide a rigorous theoretical frame to categorize and explain the new form of activism. This Article argues that improvisation — long the engine of comedy and jazz but more recently a topic of serious academic inquiry — does both. Improvisational unionism is an intentional social practice that galvanizes courageous conduct, inspires new relationships, and, most importantly, spreads. It also functions as a legal strategy selected for its unique potential to unlock worker militancy amid law and institutional restrictions that have corroded labor’s power for decades...|$|R

The method employed a constrained mixed exponential distribution model to describe the lightning optical measurements. To obtain the optimum model parameters, a scalar function of three variables (one of which is the ground flash fraction) was minimized by a numerical method.

40|$|The ball {{lightning}} phenomenon is {{explained in the}} frame of a self-organization scenario suggested by experiments performed on the spontaneously generated complex spherical space charge configuration in plasma. Originated in a hot plasma, suddenly created in a point where a lightning <b>flash</b> <b>strikes</b> the Earth surface, the {{ball lightning}} appearance proves the ability of nature to generate, by self-organization, complex structures able to ensure their own existence by exchange of matter and energy with the surroundings. Their subsequent evolution depends on the environment where they are born. Under contemporary Earth conditions the lifetime of such complexities is relatively short. A similar self-organization mechanism, produced by simple sparks in the earl Earth's atmosphere (chemically reactive plasma) is suggested to explain the genesis of complexities able to evolve into prebiotic structures.

40|$|The {{identification}} of the most vulnerable points on a given structure to be struck by lightning {{is an important issue}} on the design of areliable lightning protection system. Traditionally, these lightning strike points are identified using the rolling sphere method, through anempirical correlation with the prospective peak return stroke current. However, field observations in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore haveshown that the points where lightning <b>flashes</b> <b>strike</b> buildings also depend on the height and geometry of the structure. Since a lightningstrike point {{is believed to be the}} place on a grounded structure where a propagating upward leader is first initiated, a physical leaderinception model is used here to estimate the background electric field required to initiate a stable upward leader from the corners of somecomplex buildings. The computed location of the points from where leaders are incepted are compared with the damaged points onbuildings struck by lightning. The observed lightning strike points coincide rather well with the corners of the buildings which arecharacterized by lower leader inception electric fields. Furthermore, it is found that the geometry of the buildings significantly influencesthe conditions necessary to initiate upward leaders and, therefore, the location of the most likely strike points.

40|$|The first {{systematic}} {{observations of}} cloud to ground (CG) lightning in Brazil {{began in the}} decade of 1960 by recording the number of thunderstorm days (thunderdays) at different sites. The observations were done up to 1980, when the first map of the CG activity in the country was obtained. However, due to {{the limited number of}} observation sites, only a very approximate map of the lightning activity was obtained (Figure 1). Based on it, it was estimated an average flash density of 7 flashes. km- 2. year- 1, indicating a larger lightning activity compared to most of the countries in the temperate region. The thunderday observations were followed by observations carried out by a network of flash counters in part of the Southeast region of the country (Figure 2). A 43 -flash counter network operated from 1985 to 1995, recording pulses by a trigger circuit with a band pass filter centered at 10 kHz. (Pinto et al., 2003 a). In 1985, an instrumented tower to record CG flashes was installed in the Morro do Cachimbo Station (MCS), in the Southeast region of the country. The station was built by the local power company, the Companhia Energética of Minas Gerais (CEMIG) under the orientation of Dr. A. J. Eriksson (Eriksson, 1979), with the goal to determine the electric parameters of direct discharges in towers.

40|$|Objective: To educate {{athletic}} {{trainers and}} others {{about the dangers}} of lightning, provide lightning-safety guidelines, define safe structures and locations, and advocate prehospital care for lightning-strike victims. Background: Lightning may be the most frequently encountered severe-storm hazard endangering physically active people each year. Millions of lightning <b>flashes</b> <b>strike</b> the ground annually in the United States, causing nearly 100 deaths and 400 injuries. Three quarters of all lightning casualties occur between May and September, and nearly four fifths occur between 10 : 00 AM and 7 : 00 PM, which coincides with the hours for most athletic or recreational activities. Additionally, lightning casualties from sports and recreational activities have risen alarmingly in recent decades. Recommendations: The National Athletic Trainers' Association recommends a proactive approach to lightning safety, including the implementation of a lightning-safety policy that identifies safe locations for shelter from the lightning hazard. Further components of this policy are monitoring local weather forecasts, designating a weather watcher, and establishing a chain of command. Additionally, a flash-to-bang count of 30 seconds or more should be used as a minimal determinant of when to suspend activities. Waiting 30 minutes or longer after the last flash of lightning or sound of thunder is recommended before athletic or recreational activities are resumed. Lightningsafety strategies include avoiding shelter under trees, avoiding open fields and spaces, and suspending the use of land-line telephones during thunderstorms. Also outlined in this document are the prehospital care guidelines for triaging and treating lightning-strike victims. It is important to evaluate victims quickly for apnea, asystole, hypothermia, shock, fractures, and burns. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is effective in resuscitating pulseless victims of lightning strike. Maintenance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and first-aid certification should be required of all persons involved in sports and recreational activities.

40|$|Abstract—Empirically, {{a higher}} {{frequency}} of lightning strikes is asso-ciated with slower growth in labor productivity across the 48 contiguous U. S. states after 1990; before 1990, {{there is no}} correlation between growth and lightning. Other climate variables (e. g., temperature, rainfall, and tornadoes) {{do not conform to}} this pattern. A viable explanation is that lightning influences IT diffusion. By causing voltage spikes and dips, a higher frequency of ground strikes leads to damaged digital equipment and thus higher IT user costs. Accordingly, the <b>flash</b> density (<b>strikes</b> per square kilometer per year) should adversely affect the speed of IT diffu-sion. We find that lightning indeed seems to have slowed IT diffusion, conditional on standard controls. Hence, an increasing macroeconomic sensitivity to lightning {{may be due to the}} increasing importance of digital technologies for the growth process. I...|$|R

30|$|We {{examined}} climate, lightning, and lightning-fire data {{to determine}} which cambial phenology phase or phases corresponded with the lightning-fire season. We downloaded daily cloud-to-ground lightning <b>flash</b> (or <b>strike)</b> data from the National Lightning Detection Network for the period 1986 to 2013 for our counties of interest (Gulf County, Florida; Highlands County, Florida; and Thomas County, Georgia) and then calculated a daily mean number of flashes per month for each county. The Florida Forest Service provided lightning-fire data for a similar time period (1981 to 2016) and included the date and county for all lightning fires in Florida except those on federal and tribal lands. We used these data to calculate {{the total number of}} lightning fires and the total area burned per month during the entire period of record for each county of interest. We assessed monthly temperature and precipitation patterns using divisional data from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC 2017). We graphed the monthly temperature, precipitation, cloud-to-ground lightning flashes, and lightning-fire occurrence together along with the typical timing of the various cambial phenology phases (i.e., dormancy, earlywood production, transition, latewood production) for each study area. Finally, we compared monthly temperature and precipitation data for the study period against the long-term climate record to determine whether sampled years were typical of long-term climate patterns.|$|R
