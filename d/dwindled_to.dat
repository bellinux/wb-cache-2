5|$|By {{the time}} Mobile was {{included}} in the Mississippi Territory in 1813, the population had <b>dwindled</b> <b>to</b> roughly 300 people. The city {{was included in}} the Alabama Territory in 1817, after Mississippi gained statehood. Alabama was granted statehood in 1819; Mobile's population had increased to 809 by that time.|$|E

5|$|During the Great Depression, the {{population}} of the Green Lake settlement <b>dwindled</b> <b>to</b> 25. It remained low until the discovery of oil in 1947. Twenty wells were constructed at the Green Lake oilfield, although as of 1984, only one still operated. By 2000, {{the population}} of Green Lake was 51, the same number reported in 1970 and 1990.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, {{there were}} about 3,500 Christians of various {{denominations}} in Nablus, but that figure <b>dwindled</b> <b>to</b> about 650 in 2008. Of the Christian populace, there are seventy Orthodox Christian families, about thirty Catholic (Roman Catholic & Eastern Melkite Catholic) families and thirty Anglican families. Most Christians {{used to live in}} the suburb of Rafidia {{in the western part of}} the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{membership}} decline {{continued in}} the late 1960s and early 1970s, as older congregants died and moved away, and <b>dwindled</b> <b>to</b> {{the point where the}} congregation could no longer afford to heat the sanctuary, and thought they would have to disband. Nevertheless, in 1972 the congregation established a nursery school and prozdor (high school).|$|E
5|$|At that time, Aspen was a faded {{mining town}} whose {{population}} had <b>dwindled</b> <b>to</b> {{fewer than a}} thousand. Later in the decade the first efforts to develop a ski resort began. They continued after World War II, and in the later decades of the 20th century the city began to grow again. Other than paving the road, CDOT was unable to undertake any significant improvements to the highway corridor due to its projects elsewhere {{in the state and}} the requirement to coordinate efforts with the Forest Service, which owns most of the damaged land.|$|E
50|$|The Hedwig {{population}} began {{a decline}} in the early 1900s, <b>dwindling</b> <b>to</b> a population of ten in the 1950s, where it remained in 2000.|$|R
50|$|The Danes Hall was {{organized}} by eleven members of the Danish club on January 6, 1877. The group grew to a maximum membership of 300 members before <b>dwindling</b> <b>to</b> 32 by 1940.|$|R
5000|$|The insurgents were weakening, however, <b>dwindling</b> <b>to</b> about 1,000. By December 1864 {{they faced}} a new force under Tokugawa Yoshinobu (himself born in Mito) {{numbering}} over 10,000, which ultimately {{forced them to}} surrender.|$|R
5|$|By the 1930s, the Boddington family {{shareholding}} had <b>dwindled</b> <b>to</b> around 40 per cent. On the 22 December 1940, {{the brewery}} water tanks {{were hit by}} bombs during the Manchester Blitz, and the brewery had to be closed down for several months, with production moved temporarily to the nearby Hydes Brewery. The brewery was rebuilt with the most up-to-date and modern equipment of the time, {{and was the first}} in Europe to install stainless steel brewing vats. In 1961, the brewer Whitbread took a 13 per cent stake in the company. In 1962 the company purchased Richard Clarke & Co of Reddish, Stockport, adding 60 public houses to the firm.|$|E
5|$|From July 14, 1861 to August 31, 1861, {{the fort}} was garrisoned by the 21st New York Volunteer Infantry. Discipline {{problems}} erupted at the fort, {{due to the}} extension of the soldiers' three-month enlistments to a length of two years. A total of 41 men were convicted of dereliction of duty and imprisoned in Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas before eventually agreeing to satisfactorily complete their enlistments. In November 1861, the fort was garrisoned by men from the 14th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, commanded by a Colonel Greene. By 1863, the garrison had <b>dwindled</b> <b>to</b> a single company from that regiment.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, E was {{spoken by}} about 30,000 people, but by 2008 this number had <b>dwindled</b> <b>to</b> 9,000. Most E {{speakers}} {{are classified as}} Zhuang by the Chinese government. E speakers live primarily in the Guangxi autonomous region of China, specifically in the Rongshui Miao county and border areas of Luocheng Mulao. Villages inhabited by E speakers include Xiatan, Simo, Xinglong, and the Yonglei district. Ethnologue classifies E as rank 6b (Threatened). E speakers' most commonly spoken other languages are Yue Chinese and the Guiliu variant of Southwestern Mandarin.|$|E

5|$|Ridership on the Mountaineer {{over its}} two-year {{probationary}} period was disappointing: 58,991 in 1975 and 53,400 in 1976. Averaged over a 365-day year, this was 161 passengers {{per day in}} 1975 and 146 in 1976. By 1977 daily ridership had <b>dwindled</b> <b>to</b> 35. Monetary losses were far higher than expected: $5.7 million in FY1975 and $14.9 million in FY1976. After a brief respite, Amtrak discontinued the Mountaineer on May 31, 1977. A new train, the Hilltopper, operated {{over much of the}} same route until 1979.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln was deemed a fluke {{due to the}} Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, saw no reason why {{the president should be}} guarded; Garfield's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers. Guiteau knew the president would leave Washington for a cooler climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun he thought would look good in a museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve. His opportunities <b>dwindled</b> <b>to</b> one—Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey on the morning of July 2, 1881.|$|E
5|$|A {{surprisingly}} fast {{beginning to}} the stage, with a first hour that covered over , {{managed to keep}} any breakaways from going clear for over two hours. Twelve eventually came ahead of the peloton, with seven in the lead and five chasing between the leaders and the peloton. The third group on the road eventually <b>dwindled</b> <b>to</b> a select contingent of overall favorites, which included race leader Danilo Di Luca. Former Giro champion Stefano Garzelli attacked from this group on the day's first climb and got to the leading group of five before the summit, claiming maximum points on it and on Sestrière to gain leadership of the mountains classification {{at the end of}} the day. Garzelli's maximum advantage, at the summit of Sestrière, was just over six minutes.|$|E
50|$|The final 9-game margin masks how {{competitive}} {{the season}} actually was. In a scary echo of 1964, the Phillies saw a -game August lead <b>dwindle</b> <b>to</b> just 3 games as their offense dried up on two late-year road trips.|$|R
50|$|Early {{colonization}} {{of the hills}} included a colony of three to four hundred Dakotans at Sheho, Saskatchewan. Disappointment {{at the lack of}} the promised transcontinental rail line caused these numbers <b>to</b> <b>dwindle</b> <b>to</b> just a few by the late 1800s.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, {{because of}} {{significant}} {{investment in a}} North Sea oil play by a subsidiary, Westar Petroleum, as well as bad timing in a mining investment by another subsidiary, Westar Mining, the company ran into financial trouble. Investors saw their thousands of dollars <b>dwindle</b> <b>to</b> pennies.|$|R
5|$|After World War II ended, the U.S. Navy {{entered the}} 45 year long Cold War {{and participated in}} the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the First Persian Gulf War, and the Second Persian Gulf War / Iraq War. Following the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in 1990-91, the Soviet Red Navy fell apart, which made the United States the world's undisputed naval superpower. Nuclear power and ballistic missile technology led to new ship propulsion and weapon systems, which were used in the s and s. By 1978, the number of ships had <b>dwindled</b> <b>to</b> less than 400, many of which were from World War II, which prompted Ronald Reagan to institute a program for a modern, 600-ship Navy. Today, the United States is the world's undisputed naval superpower, with the ability to engage and project power in two simultaneous limited wars along separate fronts.|$|E
5|$|Assigned to the 9th Brigade, 3rd Division, the Liverpool Scottish {{occupied}} trenches in the Kemmel area, {{five miles}} south of Ypres. The 1/10th suffered its first fatality on 29 November: Captain Arthur Twentyman, killed while attempting to return to British lines. The combination of severe winter and trench warfare soon depleted {{the strength of the}} Liverpool Scottish. From an establishment of 26 officers and 829 men recorded in November, the battalion had <b>dwindled</b> <b>to</b> 370 able-bodied men by January 1915. Within weeks of the battalion's arrival, Major Blair, Lieutenant-Colonel Nicholl's successor, was replaced by J.R. Davidson due to ill-health. Davidson would command the battalion, albeit interrupted by wounds sustained during the Somme Offensive, until 1917, when he returned to Liverpool to become the city's Chief Engineer.|$|E
5|$|Constantinople {{began to}} decline {{continuously}} {{after the end of}} the reign of Basil II in 1025. The final blow was given by the conquest of Villardouin and Enrico Dandolo in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade, where the City was sacked and pillaged. The city subsequently became the center of the Latin Empire, created by Catholic crusaders to replace the Orthodox Byzantine Empire. Hagia Sophia was converted to a Catholic church in 1204. The Byzantine Empire was restored, albeit weakened, in 1261. Constantinople's churches, defenses, and basic services were in disrepair, and its population had <b>dwindled</b> <b>to</b> a hundred thousand from half a million during the 8th century. After the reconquest of 1261, however some of the city's monuments were restored, and some, like the two Deisis mosaics in Hagia Sofia and Kariye, were created.|$|E

5|$|Development since 1850 {{has greatly}} altered the {{places in the}} {{watershed}} where plants and animals can thrive. In a report published in 2005, the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services (BES), using data from an early General Land Office survey, compared the watershed of 1851 with that of 2003. The study showed {{that all of the}} watershed provided plant and wildlife habitat in 1851, but by 2003 only 33percent provided habitat. In 1851, water covered 10percent of the watershed but that had been cut in half by 2003. Marshes and other wetlands that had comprised 22percent of the earlier watershed <b>dwindled</b> <b>to</b> 1percent by 2003, while the percentage of land devoted to industry, commerce, and homes rose from 0 to 34. In addition, habitat remaining in 2003 was greatly disturbed, dominated by Himalayan blackberry and other invasive species and fragmented by roads. The riparian zone along the slough was generally narrow or nonexistent and devoid of trees and shrubs in places, including along the levees.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{the musical}} life of Britain was {{drastically}} curtailed. The LSO was helped to survive by large donations from Sir Thomas Beecham, who also subsidised the Hallé and the Royal Philharmonic Society. For a year {{he took the}} role, though not the title, of chief conductor of the LSO. In 1916 his millionaire father died and Beecham's financial affairs became too complicated for any further musical philanthropy on his part. In 1917 the LSO's directors agreed unanimously that they would promote no more concerts {{until the end of}} the war. The orchestra played for other managements, and managed to survive, although the hitherto remunerative work for regional choral societies <b>dwindled</b> <b>to</b> almost nothing.|$|E
5|$|Jerome made news in 1917, when strikes {{involving}} the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) {{led to the}} expulsion at gunpoint of about 60 IWW members, who were loaded on a cattle car and shipped west. Production at the mines, always subject to fluctuations, boomed during World War I, fell thereafter, rose again, then fell again {{during and after the}} Great Depression. As the ore deposits ran out, the mines closed, and the population <b>dwindled</b> <b>to</b> fewer than 100 by the mid-1950s. Efforts to save the town from oblivion succeeded when residents turned to tourism and retail sales. Jerome became a National Historic Landmark in 1967. By the early 21stcentury, Jerome had art galleries, coffee houses, restaurants, a state park, and a local museum devoted to mining history.|$|E
