40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{transport}} paths of photocarriers (electrons and holes) before collected by electrodes strongly affect bulk recombination and thus electrical properties of solar cells, including open-circuit voltage and fill factor. For boosting device performance, a general <b>design</b> <b>rule,</b> tailored to arbitrary electron to hole mobility ratio, is proposed to decide the transport paths of photocarriers. Due to a unique ability to localize and concentrate light, plasmonics is explored to manipulate photocarrier transport through spatially redistributing light absorption at the active layer of devices. Without changing the active materials, we conceive a plasmonic-electrical concept, which tunes electrical properties of solar cells via the plasmon-modified optical field distribution, to realize the <b>design</b> <b>rule.</b> Incorporating spectrally and spatially configurable metallic nanostructures, thin-film solar cells are theoretically modelled and experimentally fabricated to validate the <b>design</b> <b>rule</b> and verify the plasmonic-tunable electrical properties.

30|$|The {{enhancement}} of bendability of flexible nanoelectronics {{is critically important}} to realize future portable and wearable nanoelectronics for personal and military purposes. Because {{there is an enormous}} variety of materials and structures that are used for flexible nanoelectronic devices, a governing <b>design</b> <b>rule</b> for optimizing the bendability of these nanodevices is required. In this article, we suggest a <b>design</b> <b>rule</b> to optimize the bendability of flexible nanoelectronics through neutral axis (NA) engineering. In flexible optical nanoelectronics, transparent electrodes such as indium tin oxide (ITO) are usually the most fragile under an external load because of their brittleness. Therefore, we representatively focus on the bendability of ITO which has been widely used as transparent electrodes, and the NA is controlled by employing a buffer layer on the ITO layer. First, we independently investigate the effect of the thickness and elastic modulus of a buffer layer on the bendability of an ITO film. Then, we develop a <b>design</b> <b>rule</b> for the bendability optimization of flexible optical nanoelectronics. Because NA is determined by considering both the thickness and elastic modulus of a buffer layer, the <b>design</b> <b>rule</b> is conceived to be applicable regardless of the material and thickness that are used for the buffer layer. Finally, our <b>design</b> <b>rule</b> is applied to optimize the bendability of an organic solar cell, which allows the bending radius to reach about 1 [*]mm. Our <b>design</b> <b>rule</b> is thus expected to provide a great strategy to enhance the bending performance of a variety of flexible nanoelectronics.|$|R

30|$|To {{improve the}} {{bendability}} of flexible nanoelectronics, a buffer layer {{has been adopted}} [3, 6, 9, 15]. Researchers have reported that the mechanical bendability of electronic nanodevices can be increased by using a buffer layer above or below the ITO layer. However, they did not suggest an optimized <b>design</b> <b>rule</b> that considers both the thickness and elastic modulus of the buffer material. Because various buffer layers {{could be used to}} increase the thermal, chemical, and mechanical stabilities of flexible electronic nanodevices, a governing <b>design</b> <b>rule</b> is crucially needed to optimize the bendability of these flexible nanodevices regardless of the buffer layers that are chosen. In this article, we report a <b>design</b> <b>rule</b> for the bendability optimization of flexible optical nanoelectronics through controlling the neutral axis (NA). If we place the fragile layer such as ITO in a nanodevice at the NA position, the bending stress and strain in the layer are greatly reduced, thus enhancing the bendability of the device. Therefore, we first investigate the behavior of the NA position and the effect on the device bendability by independently considering the elastic modulus and thickness of a buffer layer on the ITO. Because the elastic modulus and thickness of a buffer layer influenced each other when determining the NA, we should consider these parameters together. Therefore, we develop a <b>design</b> <b>rule</b> for the bendability optimization of flexible electronics by controlling the NA position, considering both the thickness and elastic modulus of the buffer layer. Finally, our <b>design</b> <b>rule</b> to optimize the bendability of flexible devices is applied to an inverted OSC with an ITO optical window. We believe that our <b>design</b> <b>rule</b> based on NA engineering will provide a great advantage to improve the bendability of flexible nanoelectronics.|$|R
