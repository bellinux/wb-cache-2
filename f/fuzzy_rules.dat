The proposed <b>fuzzy</b> <b>rule</b> base determines {{the highest priority}} of nine possible heading directions. The <b>fuzzy</b> <b>rule</b> base has been developed employing genetic algorithms as an approach to dynamic path planning of autonomous multi-agents in unknown environments.

The <b>fuzzy</b> <b>rule</b> base was obtained from off-line navigation with precise sensor modeling and applied to various simulated on-line navigation.

40|$|Abstract — In most fuzzy systems, the {{completeness}} of the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>rule</b> base {{is required}} to generate meaningful output when classical fuzzy reasoning methods are applied. This means, in other words, that the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>rule</b> base has to cover all possible inputs. Regardless {{of the way of}} rule base construction, be it created by human experts or by an automated manner, often incomplete rule bases are generated. One simple solution to handle sparse <b>fuzzy</b> <b>rule</b> bases and to make infer reasonable output is the application of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>rule</b> interpolation (FRI) methods. In this paper, we present a <b>Fuzzy</b> <b>Rule</b> Interpolation Matlab Toolbox, which is freely available.

In this paper, a new monotone <b>fuzzy</b> <b>rule</b> relabeling technique to relabel a non-monotone <b>fuzzy</b> <b>rule</b> base provided by domain experts is proposed.

5000|$|FML was {{designed}} and developed by Giovanni Acampora during his Ph.D. course in Computer Science, at University of Salerno, Italy, in 2004. The original idea inspired Giovanni Acampora to create FML was the necessity of creating a cooperative fuzzy-based framework aimed at automatically controlling a living environment characterized by a plethora of heterogeneous devices whose interactions were devoted to maximize the human comfort under energy saving constraints. This framework represented {{one of the first}} concrete examples of Ambient Intelligence. Beyond this pioneering application, the major advantage of using XML to describe a fuzzy system is hardware/software interoperability. Indeed, all that is needed to read an FML file is the appropriate schema for that file, and an FML parser. This markup approach makes it much easier to exchange fuzzy systems between software: for example, a machine learning application could extract <b>fuzzy</b> <b>rules</b> which could then be read directly into a fuzzy inference engine or uploaded into a fuzzy controller. Also, with technologies like XSLT, it is possible to compile the FML into the programming language of your choice, ready for embedding into whatever application you please. As stated by Mike Watts on his popular Computational Intelligence blog:"Although Acampora's motivation for developing FML seems to be to develop embedded fuzzy controllers for ambient intelligence applications, FML could be a real boon for developers of fuzzy rule extraction algorithms: from my own experience during my PhD, I know that having to design a file format and implement the appropriate parsers for rule extraction and fuzzy inference engines can be a real pain, taking as much time as implementing the rule extraction algorithm itself. I would much rather have used something like FML for my work." ...|$|E

It is known that both requirements are usually contradictory, however, these kinds of algorithms can obtain a set of solutions with different trade-offs. The application of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms to fuzzy rule-based systems {{is often referred to}} as multiobjective genetic fuzzy systems. The first study on multiobjective genetic fuzzy systems was multiobjective genetic <b>fuzzy</b> <b>rule</b> selection in order to simultaneously achieve accuracy maximization and complexity minimization. This approach is based on the generation of a set of candidate <b>fuzzy</b> classification <b>rules</b> by considering a previously fixed granularity or multiple fuzzy partitions with different granularities for each attribute. Then, a multiobjective evolutionary optimization algorithm is applied to perform <b>fuzzy</b> <b>rule</b> selection. Although the multiple granularity approach is one of the most promising approaches, its interpretability loss has often been pointed out. In this work, we propose a mechanism to generate single granularity-based <b>fuzzy</b> classification <b>rules</b> for multiobjective genetic <b>fuzzy</b> <b>rule</b> selection. This mechanism is able to specify appropriate single granularities for <b>fuzzy</b> <b>rule</b> extraction before performing multiobjective genetic <b>fuzzy</b> <b>rule</b> selection.
