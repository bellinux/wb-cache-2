5|$|By March 1, 2005, over a {{year after}} the war ended, the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) had {{disarmed}} and demobilized 103,018 people who claimed to have fought for former president Charles Taylor or the two rebel groups, Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) or the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL).

5|$|Despite heavy fishing {{pressure}} {{within its}} range, the cloudy catshark remains common, {{perhaps because it}} may be more biologically productive than most other sharks. As a result, it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Cloudy catsharks <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> locations off Japan {{have been found to be}} contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDEs), which they acquire from their food. One likely source of these pollutants is the use of the pesticide DDT by developing nations in southern Asia.|$|E

Objects found in the wilderness can be kept in the inventory for later use.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, the {{battalion}} was re-raised {{as a part-time}} unit of the Citizens Forces based in Newcastle, New South Wales, drawing lineage <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> previously existing infantry units.

It was re-formed in 1939 and undertook garrison duty in Australia during the Second World War until 1943 when it was merged once again.|$|E

But, Hygberht was still being called archbishop in 799.

40|$|In a {{multiple}} transmit antenna, single antenna per receiver downlink channel with limited channel state feedback, {{we consider the}} following question: given a constraint on the total system-wide feedback load, is it preferable to get low-rate/coarse channel feedback <b>from</b> <b>a</b> large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> receivers or high-rate/high-quality feedback <b>from</b> <b>a</b> smaller <b>number</b> <b>of</b> receivers? Acquiring feedback from many receivers allows multi-user diversity to be exploited, while high-rate feedback allows for very precise selection of beamforming directions. We {{show that there is}} a strong preference for obtaining high-quality feedback, and that obtaining near-perfect channel information from as many receivers as possible provides a significantly larger sum rate than collecting a few feedback bits <b>from</b> <b>a</b> large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> users.
