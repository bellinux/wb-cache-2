5|$|Before season 20, {{little was}} shown {{concerning}} Cartman's romantic interests, {{as for the}} most part, his attitude towards females had been sexist. However, at least in one episode ("Chef Goes Nanners"), Cartman develops an attraction to Wendy, which is apparent {{from the end of}} episode when Wendy describes her temporary infatuation towards Cartman as 'sexual tension' and even though Cartman agrees in front of Wendy, <b>he</b> <b>sighs</b> with sorrow at being alone again. During a period when he was physically unable to control his speech and he repeatedly blurted hidden feelings, he expressed a romantic interest in classmate Patty Nelson, a side character who has not been seen before or since. In Season 20, after Cartman is wrongfully accused of being a persistent and highly aggressive internet troll (actually Gerald Broflovski) leaving foul posts primarily targeting women and girls on South Park Elementary's school message boards, the other boys destroy most of Cartman's electronics, and by extension, his social media presence, causing him to become despondent to everything around him. That is until Heidi Turner, who had quit social media in response to the trolling, offers to show him life outside of social media. The two quickly become friends, and later, an official and shockingly very happy couple.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sighed</b> from an emotion, partly natural, perhaps, {{and partly}} assumed.|$|R
6000|$|But {{he never}} heard me. He had forgot me and {{everything}} else. He had his chin in his hand, thinking. Pretty soon <b>he</b> <b>sighs</b> {{and shakes his}} head; then sighs again, and says: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sighs</b> {{over the}} contemplation of its poverty, takes a bit of chalk {{from one of the}} {{cupboard}} shelves, and pauses with it in his hand, uncertain what addition to make to the account.|$|E
6000|$|Fain {{to accept}} his promise, and wishing to propitiate him, Mr Wegg looks on as <b>he</b> <b>sighs</b> and pours himself out more tea, and then says, {{trying to get a}} {{sympathetic}} tone into his voice: ...|$|E

6000|$|... [But {{she drops}} the book, and MAGGIE fades from the room. It {{is not a}} very clever departure, and the old diplomatist smiles. Then <b>he</b> <b>sighs</b> a {{beautiful}} sigh, for he does all things beautifully.] ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>he</b> <b>sighs</b> {{with relief}} when she parts from him; Her proud head held in its black silk scarf Gone under the archway, home, he can join The men that lounge {{in a group}} on the wharf.|$|E
6000|$|... (2.) Death {{is at his}} work, {{cutting of}} him down, hewing both bark and heart, both body and soul asunder. The man groans, but death hears him not; he looks ghastly, carefully, dejectedly; <b>he</b> <b>sighs,</b> he sweats, he trembles, but death matters nothing.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sighed</b> heavily; {{his head}} dropped again on his breast--he left me.|$|R

6000|$|He spake not truth, however wise, {{who said}} That happy, and that hapless men in sleep Have equal fortune, fallen from care as deep As countless, careless, races of the dead.

6000|$|He {{turns out}} of the High Street at the corner, {{dismounts}} with a sigh, and pushes his machine through {{the gates of the}} Antrobus stable yard, as the apprentice with the high collar holds them open.

60|$|Endymion was {{standing}} before the fire, and as nervous as a man could well be. <b>He</b> <b>sighed,</b> and <b>he</b> <b>sighed</b> more than once.
