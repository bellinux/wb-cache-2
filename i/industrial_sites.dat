5|$|Many unwelcome animals visit or {{make their}} home in {{residential}} buildings, <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> and urban areas. Some contaminate foodstuffs, damage structural timbers, chew through fabrics or infest stored dry goods. Some inflict great economic loss, others carry diseases or cause fire hazards, and some are just a nuisance. Control of these pests has been attempted by improving sanitation and garbage control, modifying the habitat, and using repellents, growth regulators, traps, baits and pesticides.|$|E

Three weeks later, on 1 July, the battleship and her escorts sailed once more for Japanese home waters for carrier air strikes on the enemy's heartland. Nine days later, carrier planes from TF 38 destroyed 72 enemy aircraft {{on the ground}} and smashed <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> in the Tokyo area. Wisconsin and the other ships made no attempt whatsoever to conceal the location of their armada, {{due in large part to}} a weak Japanese response to their presence.|$|E
5|$|Agaricus bernardii is a {{saprobic}} species. Its mushrooms fruit singly, scattered, or {{in groups}} on the ground. They grow in sandy soils, lawns, and in habitats with a high salt concentration, like along ocean coasts and salt marshes. Once primarily a maritime species, the fungus has spread inland to roadside verges where salt {{has been applied to}} de-ice the roads. Fruit bodies sometimes form underground. Mushrooms can also grow in fairy rings, especially when in grasslands or pastures. A Czech study determined that the mushrooms will strongly bioaccumulate silver from contaminated soil. Although the average concentration of silver in the soil is typically less than 1 milligram per kilogram of soil, it can be significantly elevated near <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> such as mines and smelters. The concentration of silver in the caps—which reached levels of up to 544mg per kg of mushroom tissue (dry weight)—was about twice that of the stems.|$|E
5|$|Private Ambulance Service – Normal {{commercial}} {{companies with}} paid employees, but often on contract {{to the local}} or national government. Private companies may provide only the patient transport elements of ambulance care (i.e. nonurgent or ambulatory transport), but in some places, they are contracted to provide emergency care, or to form a 'second tier' response. In many areas private services cover all emergency transport functions and government agencies do not provide this service. Companies such as Falck, Acadian Ambulance, and American Medical Response {{are some of the}} larger companies that provide such services. These organisations may also provide services known as 'Stand-by' cover at <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> or at special events. From April 2011 all private ambulance services in the UK must be Care Quality Commission (CQC) registered. Private services in Canada operate non-emergency patient transfers or for private functions only.|$|E

5|$|The Romans {{constructed}} numerous aqueducts. A surviving treatise by Frontinus, {{who served}} as curator aquarum (water commissioner) under Nerva, reflects the administrative importance placed on ensuring the water supply. Masonry channels carried water from distant springs and reservoirs along a precise gradient, using gravity alone. After the water passed through the aqueduct, it was collected in tanks and fed through pipes to public fountains, baths, toilets, or <b>industrial</b> <b>sites.</b> The main aqueducts {{in the city of}} Rome were the Aqua Claudia and the Aqua Marcia. The complex system built to supply Constantinople had its most distant supply drawn from over 120km away along a sinuous route of more than 336km. Roman aqueducts were built to remarkably fine tolerance, and to a technological standard that was not to be equalled until modern times. The Romans also made use of aqueducts in their extensive mining operations across the empire, at sites such as Las Medulas and Dolaucothi in South Wales.|$|E
5|$|The town {{developed}} in the Middle Ages {{on the main road}} to London and the regionally significant Romford Market was established in 1247. The early history of Romford and the immediate area is agricultural and it is recorded as being the location of a number of mills used to grind corn. The area was a focus of the leather industry from the 15th to the early 19th centuries and there is record {{of a wide range of}} industries such as cloth making, weaving, charcoal burning, metal working and brewing. Communications played an important part in its development; the main road to London was maintained by the Middlesex and Essex Turnpike Trust from 1721 and Romford became a coaching town in the 18th century. Several failed attempts were made in the early 19th century to connect the town to the Thames via a Romford Canal. Initially intended to transport agricultural products to London and later intended to serve growing <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> in Romford, only two miles of canal were constructed and the canal company were unable to reach the town.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn the aim {{to prevent}} and manage major {{accidents}} on an <b>industrial</b> <b>site,</b> many methodologies and directives have been developed. But, in France no formalised methodology has been proposed to competent authorities to determine a risk level of an <b>industrial</b> <b>site.</b> A first work of methodologies' synthesis permitted to propose some basis of a new methodology. This one {{will be based on}} the <b>industrial</b> <b>site,</b> the environment and the safety management. To reach this aim, four indexes are developed; the first one concerning the hazard source (the establishment), the second one the flux (the vector of propagation of accident considering the specific environment), the third one the vulnerability of targets (human, environmental or equipment), and finally the fourth one concerning the safety management (prevention and protection actions). This new approach will provide a cartography of risk level for an <b>industrial</b> <b>site</b> and its vicinity to bring a decision help for risk managers and competent authorities...|$|R
5|$|Wetherby {{tried to}} diversify the {{industries}} located in Kentucky {{to balance the}} state's primarily agrarian economy. He expanded the Agricultural and Industrial Development Board and charged it with conducting land surveys to identify potential <b>industrial</b> <b>sites.</b> He encouraged the development of modern airports {{in the state and}} supported the canalization of the Big Sandy River and improvement of the locks and dams on the Kentucky River. He continued to personally lead tours given by the state's Chamber of Commerce. Among the industries that came to the state during his administration were the General Electric Appliance Park in Louisville and the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah. In 1954, he used the state police to quash labor unrest in Central City {{and other parts of the}} Western Coal Fields. He was not a pawn of industry, however: he secured passage of the state's first laws regulating strip mining and killed a right-to-work bill in 1954.|$|E
5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog has been {{detected}} {{in a wide}} range of habitats. It is generally associated with coastal swamps, wetlands, marshes, dams, ditches, small rivers, woodlands, and forests, but populations have also been found at former <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> (for instance, the Brickpit). It has even been found in human vessels such as bathtubs. The requirements of its habitat have been difficult to determine, for it has been found {{in a wide range}} of water bodies except fast-flowing streams. It is most typically found in short-lived freshwater ponds that are still, shallow, unshaded, and unpolluted, and it tends to avoid waters that contain predatory fish, whether native or introduced. However, it is most often found in areas that have been affected by human habitation. The frog prefers water bodies that support emergent vegetation, such as reeds and bullrushes, for basking, and winter habitats consist of available shelters around the breeding site, which can be vegetation, rocks, rubbish, or human debris and discarded building materials. Grassy habitats are usually close at hand to provide suitable terrestrial feeding grounds. It prefers waterways with a substrate of sand, rock, or clay, and can tolerate a wide range of water turbidities, pH and oxygen levels, and temperatures, although these can hamper physical growth. Although its legs provide much grip, the frog does not choose to climb trees or live up them to any significant extent. It spends most of its time within 10cm of the ground and rarely ventures more than a metre above the ground. The green and golden bell frog also has the ability to sit still for several minutes.|$|E
