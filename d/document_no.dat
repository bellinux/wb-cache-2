U.S. Army Major John Butler was responsible for the upper Columbia River and Snake River and in 1932, his 1,000-page report was submitted to Congress. It recommended the Grand Coulee Dam and nine others on the river, including some in Canada. [...] The report stated that electricity sales from the Grand Coulee Dam could pay for construction costs.

Originally named “Bloomington Dam”, it was renamed Jennings Randolph Lake in 1987 to honor the US Senator from West Virginia who was instrumental in this and many other water resource projects across the nation.Construction of the lake was completed in 1981, and resulted in the flooding {{of the community of}} Shaw, West Virginia and the realignment of West Virginia Route 46. [...] The dam, rolled earth and rock fill, is 296 feet high, has a crest length of 2,130 feet and contains 10 million cubic yards of material. Jennings Randolph Lake strives to provide water quality improvements and reduce flood damages downstream of the lake, provide a source of water supply for downstream municipalities and industries, and provide the public with recreation opportunities. With a full conservation pool, the lake, controls a drainage area of 263 square miles, and is about 5.5 miles long and has a surface area of 952 acres.The lake, which serves as an emergency reservoir for the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, is managed by the Corps of Engineers. Coordination of the lake's use for water supply purposes is managed by the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin (ICPRB).|$|E

Why, in thirty or forty years, were there no books, any great man would grow mythic, the contemporaries who had seen him, being once all dead.

To attempt theorizing on such matters would profit little: they are matters which refuse to be theoremed and diagramed; which Logic ought {{to know that she}} cannot speak of.

60|$|After {{the little}} scandal with cousin Will, Harry's dignity {{would not allow}} him to stay longer at Castlewood: he wrote a majestic letter to {{the lord of the}} mansion, {{explaining}} the circumstances which had occurred, and, as he called in Parson Sampson to supervise the <b>document,</b> <b>no</b> doubt it contained none of those eccentricities in spelling which figured in his ordinary correspondence at this period. He represented to poor Maria, that after blackening the eye and damaging the nose of a son of the house, he should remain in it with a very bad grace; and she was forced to acquiesce in the opinion that, for the present, his absence would best become him. Of course, she wept plentiful tears at parting with him. He would go to London, and see younger beauties: he would find none, none who would love him like his fond Maria. I fear Mr. Warrington did not exhibit any profound emotion on leaving her: nay, he cheered up immediately after he crossed Castlewood Bridge, and made his horses whisk over the road at ten miles an hour: he sang to them to go along: he nodded to the pretty girls by the roadside: he chucked my landlady under the chin: he certainly was not inconsolable. Truth is, he longed to be back in London again, to make a figure at St. James's, at Newmarket, wherever the men of fashion congregated. All that petty Tunbridge society of women and card-playing seemed child's-play to him now he had tasted the delight of London life.|$|E
