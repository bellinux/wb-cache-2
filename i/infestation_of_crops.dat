She remained at the University of Maine throughout her career, obtaining her master's degree in 1911 and her doctorate from Cornell University a year later. While at Cornell, she became friends with the Comstock family. She published about eighty scientific papers on aphids, their identification, their biology and the role they played in the environment. She made the important discovery that the eggs of the melon aphid overwintered on a weed, (Sedum purpureum), and that removing this weed from the vicinity reduced <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> the following year.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} in growing sweet basil {{was carried out}} in the period 2008 - 2010 in Fajsławice (Lublin region), on podzolic soil. The study evaluated the biometric traits of the plants, yield, the qualitative parameters of herbal raw material and weed <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>crop</b> in dependence on growth simulators (Asahi SL, Bio-algeen, Titanit) and the forecrop (winter wheat or spring barley + white mustard cover crop). Plots without foliar application of the growth stimulators were the control treatment. Tillage, mineral NPK fertilization as well as mechanical and chemical weed control were typical for this plant species and consistent with the recommendations for herbal plant protection. A hypothesis was made that the application of growth stimulators would {{have a positive effect on}} basil productivity, raw material quality and weed <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> the basil <b>crop.</b> It was also assumed that the phytosanitary and fertilizing effects <b>of</b> the cover <b>crop</b> would result in higher and qualitatively better yield compared to the cereal forecrop alone (winter wheat). The best quantitative parameters of sweet basil raw material and the highest reduction in air-dry weight of weeds in the crop were observed after the application of the growth stimulators. The forecrop - spring barley + a white mustard cover crop that is ploughed in - also had a beneficial effect on yield and weed <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> the plant in question. The traditional crop protection method used in the basil crop, without the application of the growth stimulators, resulted in a lower plant height and a smaller number of shoots per plant. This caused higher weed <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>crop</b> and a decrease in yield. The positive side of the non-application of growth stimulators was a better chemical composition of basil raw material.

Low labor intensity of this system also makes it possible to grow crops in locations where it is a problem to maintain optimal sowing time. However, the use of no-tillage can cause increased weed <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> plants and as a consequence a decline in crop yields. The present study investigated the effect of two tillage systems, plough tillage and direct drilling, on the species composition, density and air-dry weight <b>of</b> weeds in <b>crops</b> <b>of</b> two soybean cultivars (‘Aldana’ and ‘Augusta’).

40|$|Micronutrient {{deficiencies}} {{are especially}} widespread in plants, animals, and human in many Asian countries {{due to the}} calcareous nature of soils, high pH, low organic matter, salt stress, continuous drought, high bicarbonates in irrigation water and imbalanced application of fertilizers. By producing more HCO 3 - and OH- in the rhizosphere, the pH of the soil solution and, consequently, the pH of plant sap will increase enough to cause the precipitation of micronutrients, lowering their level of availability as a whole. Some of the adverse effects that will develop when plants are stressed with micronutrient deficiencies include lower crop yield and quality; imperfect plant morphological structure such as fewer xylem vessels with smaller size; increased bio and non-bio-stresses; widespread <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> with various diseases and pests; low activation of phytosidrophores and lower fertilizer use efficiencies.

The important questions are whether farmers will purchase and apply this product to reduce aflatoxin contamination of crops, and if so under what conditions. A study was carried out to address these questions and assess determinants of willingness to pay (WTP) for the product among maize and groundnut farmers in Kano and Kaduna states in Nigeria. A multistage sampling technique was used to collect primary data from 492 farmers. The majority of farmers who had direct experience with Aflasafe (experienced farmers) in Kano (80. 7 %) and Kaduna (84. 3 %) had a WTP bid value {{equal to or greater}} than the threshold price ($ 10) at which Aflasafe was to be sold. The mean WTP estimates for Aflasafe for experienced farmers in Kano and Kaduna were statistically the same. However, values of $ 3. 56 and $ 7. 46 were offered in Kano and Kaduna states, respectively, by farmers who had never applied Aflasafe (inexperienced farmers), and the difference here was significant (P < 0. 01). Regression results indicate that contact with extension agents (P < 0. 01) and access to credit (P < 0. 05) positively and significantly influenced the probability that a farmer {{would be willing to pay}} more for Aflasafe than the threshold price. Lack of awareness of the importance of Aflasafe was the major reason cited by inexperienced farmers (64 % in Kano state and 21 % in Kaduna state) for not using the product.

40|$|<b>Infestation</b> <b>of</b> cereals and cowpeas by Striga species {{constitute}} a major constraint to increased crop productivity in the savannas of northern Nigeria. Field surveys were undertaken in Jigawa State, Nigeria in 2012 to assess (i) {{the level and}} extent <b>of</b> Strgia <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> cereal and cowpea fields (ii) the severity of Striga attack on crops and (iii) to determine the factors associated with Striga <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> fields. The {{study was conducted in}} 48 communities. Eight farmer's fields were sampled in each community along two intersecting transects. Striga hermonthica incidence ranged from 58 to 100 % in sorghum fields and from 0 to 100 % in millet fields. In sorghum and millet fields, number of emerged Striga plants ranged from 4750 to 431, 500 and 0 to 251, 750 plants ha? 1 respectively. For cowpea, S. gesnerioides population ranged from 1625 to 105, 375 plants ha? 1. The severity of Striga attack on sorghum was devastating in all the communities studied. Except in a few cases, all cowpea plants in fields surveyed in most communities were attacked by S. gesnerioides. Field infestation was largely related to poor soil fertility. Stepwise multiple regression identified latitude, pH, available P, Cu and exchangeable K as potentially most important in explaining observed variations in S. hermonthica infestation in sorghum fields. For millet fields, soil pH, available P, Zn and latitude accounted for most of the variations in Striga population whereas latitude, total N, organic C, exchangeable Ca, ECEC, pH, available Mn and Cu accounted for most of the observed variations in S. gesnerioides population in cowpea fields. Our study showed that Striga is a major problem in Jigawa State with almost all the cowpea, sorghum and millet fields infested with the parasite.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, organic farming has been {{proposed}} as a possible way of reducing N leaching from agricultural soils and improving the use efficiency of plant nutrients. This is, to a large extent, considered to {{be attributed to the}} fact that synthetic fertilisers are not allowed in such systems and the N inputs mainly originate in various types of organic manures. In this overview, results from a number of Swedish field studies are presented in which crop yields, nutrient-use efficiencies and leaching in organic and conventional systems are evaluated. Some studies were conducted in lysimeters and others in large tile-drained field plots. In two lysimeter experiments, leaching of N derived from either poultry manure or red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) green manure were compared with fertiliser N, all labeled with 15 - N. In the lysimeters on which poultry manure was applied, 32 % of N applied leached during three years, whereas only about 3 % leached in ammonium nitrate fertilised lysimeters. In plots on a sandy soil, annual N leaching loads averaged over the whole 6 -yr crop rotation reached 39 kg N ha- 1 in the organic rotations and 25 kg N ha- 1 in the conventional rotation. Phosphorusleaching loads were overall small in all systems, whereas K leaching was highest in the conventional rotation (i. e., on average, 27 kg ha- 1 yr- 1). In terms <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> yields, they were reduced by 20 to 80 % in the organic rotations compared to the same crops in the conventional rotations. This was explained in terms of N deficiency, weed competition, and <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> diseases in the organic systems.

Long-term field studies of population dynamics and migratory flights of H. zea and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) in the United States were evaluated using X-band radar observations and profiles of atmospheric conditions. These studies identified characteristic patterns of migratory flight that are largely associated with vertical profiles of temperature and wind speed. Collective patterns of moth migrations were generally highly correlated with wind headings, but often at a significant angular deviation. Preliminary analyses are presented between moth distributions in the aerosphere estimated from discrete moth counts using X-band radar and bulk reflectivity data from NEXRAD Doppler radar.

We determined how <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> marula is associated with proximity to mango crops at field and landscape scales over two fruiting seasons on three farms in north-eastern South Africa. This is one of few studies to date to consider pest spillover from crop fields to natural vegetation and the only one performed in a biodiverse region with relatively little habitat transformation. Over three sampling periods, C. cosyra <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> marula always decreased with distance from mango fields. At the landscape scale, marula alongside crop fields were 30 {{times more likely to be}} infested than in distant vegetation (1. 3 - 6 km from mango), suggesting that spillover occurs from crop fields to natural vegetation. During late mango and marula fruiting, twice as many flies infested marula than mango. However, over the two months post-mango fruiting, up to 25 times more C. cosyra were trapped in mango fields than in bordering natural vegetation. Although pests spillover from crop fields into natural vegetation to use manila as an alternate host, biological control in the natural vegetation may eliminate this habitat as a pest reservoir outside the crop season.

5000|$|Many {{descendants}} of freed slaves {{continued to work}} as sharecroppers and laborers after emancipation, but many migrated among the counties, moved to cities, or left the state for others considered to offer more opportunity. Around 1910-20, the <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> the cotton <b>crop</b> by the boll weevil destroyed much <b>of</b> the <b>crops</b> and plantation system, but the lingering effects of a cotton economy remain evident. After the boll weevil and increased mechanization of agriculture, thousands of African Americans left Alabama to go to industrial cities of the North and Midwest in the Great Migration {{of the first half}} of the 20th century. But, African Americans continue to make up the majority proportion of the population in most rural Black Belt counties. Today the term [...] "Black Belt" [...] is commonly used by scholars and the media as a demographic characterization, as well as a geologic one.|$|R
40|$|In the Gharb and Loukkos regions, the Tortoise Beetle (Cassida vittata Vill) {{develops}} a single annual generation due to obligatory imaginal dormancy induced by summer conditions. The weekly counts {{of the various}} stages of the insect made during two campaigns, reveal a homogeneous life cycle for all areas covered by the study: arrival of adults on fields of sugar beet from early January, feeding and spawning starting from late February to early March, straddling larval development, adult of the year generation and migration to sites of aestivation. The influence of these sites of aestivating on the <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> adjacent beet <b>crops</b> has been sought. Depending on the method of analysis used, it seems not to be clear correlation. At their awakening, the Tortoise Beetle likely scatter freely on the fields...|$|R

Wild plant species are often considered a source <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> pests in mixed landscapes but this view rarely considers pest spillover in the opposite direction (from crop fields to natural vegetation), or spatiotemporal variability in resources between crop and wild habitats. We investigate how <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> mango <b>crop</b> (Mangifera indica, Anacardiaceae) and a related wild host (marula, Sclerocarya birrea, Anacardiaceae) by a major subtropical fruit crop pest (Ceratitis cosyra, Diptera: Tephritidae) varies with distance from the boundary between crop and natural vegetation. We determined how <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> marula is associated with proximity to mango crops at field and landscape scales over two fruiting seasons on three farms in north-eastern South Africa. This is one of few studies to date to consider pest spillover from crop fields to natural vegetation and the only one performed in a biodiverse region with relatively little habitat transformation. Over three sampling periods, C. cosyra <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> marula always decreased with distance from mango fields. At the landscape scale, marula alongside crop fields were 30 {{times more likely to be}} infested than in distant vegetation (1. 3 – 6  km from mango), suggesting that spillover occurs from crop fields to natural vegetation. During late mango and marula fruiting, twice as many flies infested marula than mango. However, over the two months post-mango fruiting, up to 25 times more C. cosyra were trapped in mango fields than in bordering natural vegetation. Although pests spillover from crop fields into natural vegetation to use marula as an alternate host, biological control in the natural vegetation may eliminate this habitat as a pest reservoir outside the crop season. Other nearby crops may be more important than wild hosts for maintaining C. cosyra out of mango season. Landscape planning should consider proximity and arrangement <b>of</b> fields containing <b>crops</b> that host shared pests at different times of the year.

40|$|The main {{limitations}} {{with existing}} fungal spore traps {{are that they}} are stationary and cannot be used in inaccessible or remote areas of Australia. This may result in delayed assessment, possible spread <b>of</b> harmful <b>crop</b> <b>infestations</b> and loss <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> yield and productivity. Fitted with the developed smart spore trap the UAV can fly, detect and monitor spores of plant pathogens in areas which previously were almost impossible to monitor. The technology will allow for earlier detection of emergency plant pests (EPPs) incursions by providing efficient and effective airborne surveillance, helping to protect Australia’s crops, pastures and the environment. The project {{is led by the}} Cooperative Research Centre for National Plant Biosecurity, with ARCAA/ QUT, CSIRO and the Queensland Government also providing resources.

40|$|In recent years, a {{significant}} increase in weed <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> agricultural <b>crops</b> with Artemisia vulgaris has been observed in the south-western region of Poland. The ease of migration of this expansive species results {{from the fact that it}} does not face competition from segetal weeds and therefore poses a great threat to the ecological balance. During the period 2008 – 2011, a floristic study was carried out using the Braun-Blanquet method in an abandoned field adjacent to a maize monoculture grown under two tillage systems: plough and ploughless tillage. These observations allowed an evaluation of the actual risk of spread of Artemisia vulgaris depending on tillage system. The vicinity of the abandoned field had {{a significant}} effect on the penetration of Artemisia vulgaris into maize <b>crops.</b> Higher numbers <b>of</b> individu-als of this species were found under ploughless tillage compared to plough tillage, regardless of the distance from the field edge, and its increased competitive effects on Viola arvensis L. and Ve-ronica persica L. could be observed. The lowest grain yield was obtained under ploughless tillage where the strong competitive effects of Artemisia vulgaris were observed even in the plot most distant from the abandoned field adjacent to the maize crop. Key words: weed community, reduced tillage, Artemisia vulgaris, migration, penetration, competitive effects, Zea may...|$|R
40|$|Until 1995, the Avena fatua (odos) wasn’t {{even known}} as a weed in Burnas Plain wheat crop. Starting with the {{beginning}} of {{the first decade of the}} millennium, also fostered by the climate change process, Avena fatua has been slowly, but surely, installed in the area. By 2010 it reached almost 50 plants/m 2 on wheat after wheat and about 90 plants/m 2 in 3 years wheat monoculture. Over the past three years, the specie’s density has logarithmically increased up to 600 plants/m 2 on wheat after wheat and to almost 900 plants/m 2 in 3 years wheat monoculture. The surfaces identified by us have exceeded 1500 ha, while the yield losses reach up to 100 %. In these conditions, the rape-wheat simple crop rotation reduces weed infestation and keeps it slightly variable between 5 - 10 plants/m 2, well below the economic threshold of tolerance. At the same time, substantive amendments in weed’s biology and ecology were observed, it becoming therophytes - hemitherophytes due to climate change. Can talk about a weed <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>crop</b> with biannual and annual forms. Between all the chemical methods used so far, very good results were obtained with the Pallas 75 WG product, at a dose of 150 g/ha, even without safener...|$|R
5000|$|Delta's origins can {{be traced}} to a {{decision}} by B. R. Coad and Collett E. Woolman. Coad was an employee of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's field laboratory in Tallulah, Louisiana; Woolman was with its extension service. They worked on finding a solution to the boll weevil <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> cotton <b>crops</b> and concluded that the [...] "dusting" [...] of an insecticide powder from the air would be the most effective form of treatment. From this decision, Huff Daland Dusters Incorporated was born. It was founded on May 30, 1924, in Macon, Georgia, and became the world's first aerial crop dusting company. The company moved to Monroe, Louisiana, in 1925. Woolman left his position with the extension service and in the off-season traveled with the company to Peru, where they helped to establish crop-dusting and passenger services. With this experience, Woolman returned to the United States and in 1928 raised the capital to buy Huff Daland, purchasing it on September 13, 1928, and renaming the company Delta Air Service, with its headquarters in Monroe. The name Delta, referring to the Mississippi Delta, was suggested by Catherine Fitzgerald, a secretary who later would rise to the rank of an executive in the company.|$|R
