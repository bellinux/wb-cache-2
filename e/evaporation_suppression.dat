50|$|The {{specific}} {{mechanism that}} underlies monolayer evaporation resistance has {{been attributed to}} the physical barrier formed by the presence of these materials {{on the surface of the}} water (see figure). The extent to which a material can resist the evaporation of water is best treated on a case-by-case basis, however, a number of empirically derived formulas have been reported. Before the advent of surface spectroscopic techniques such as Brewster Angle Microscopy (BAM) and Glancing Incidence X-Ray reflectrometry (GIXD), it was thought that the intermolecular spacing between monolayer molecules was the largest determinant factor governing <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppression.</b> When the surface density of the monolayer was sufficiently small, water molecules were presumed to pass through the space between molecules. Scattering and imaging results, however, revealed that the intermolecular distance between monolayer molecules was essentially constant, and that evaporation was more likely at domain boundaries.The factors governing the efficacy of an evaporation suppressing monolayer are the ability to remain tightly packed despite changes in surface pressure, the ability to adhere to the surface of water, and to neighbouring molecules.|$|E

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by the American Geophysical Union {{and can be}} found at: [URL] of saline solutions from porous media, common in arid areas, involves complex interactions between mass transport, energy exchange and phase transitions. We quantified evaporation of saline solutions from heterogeneous sand columns under constant hydraulic boundary conditions to focus on effects of salt precipitation on evaporation dynamics. Mass loss measurements and infrared thermography were used to quantify evaporation rates. The latter method enables quantification of spatial and temporal variability of salt precipitation to identify its dynamic effects on evaporation. Evaporation from columns filled with texturally-contrasting sand using different salt solutions revealed preferential salt precipitation within the fine textured domains. Salt precipitation reduced evaporation rates from the fine textured regions by nearly an order of magnitude. In contrast, low evaporation rates from coarse-textured regions (due to low capillary drive) exhibited less salt precipitation and consequently less <b>evaporation</b> rate <b>suppression.</b> Experiments provided insights into two new phenomena: (1) a distinct increase in evaporation rate at the onset of evaporation; and (2) a vapor pumping mechanism related to the presence of a salt crust over semidry media. Both phenomena are related to local vapor pressure gradients established between pore water and the surface salt crust. Comparison of two salts: NaCl and NaI, which tend to precipitate above the matrix surface and within matrix pores, respectively, shows a much stronger influence of NaCl on <b>evaporation</b> rate <b>suppression.</b> This disparity reflects the limited effect of NaI precipitation on matrix resistivity for solution and vapor flows...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{intensity}} and duration of tropical rain events is critical to modelling the rate and timing of wetcanopy <b>evaporation,</b> the <b>suppression</b> of transpiration, the generation of infiltration-excess overland flow and hence to erosion, and to river responsiveness. Despite this central role, few studies have addressed the characteristics of equatorial rainstorms. This study analyses rainfall data for a 5 km 2 region largely comprising of the 4 km 2 Sapat Kalisun Experimental Catchment {{in the interior of}} northeastern Borneo at sampling frequencies from 1 min 1 to 1 day 1. The work clearly shows that most rainfall within this inland, forested area is received during regular short-duration events (< 15 min) that have a relatively low intensity (i. e. less than two 0 Ð 2 mm rain-gauge tips in almost all 5 min periods). The rainfall appears localized, with significant losses in intergauge correlations being observable in minutes {{in the case of the}} typical mid-afternoon, convective events. This suggests that a dense rain-gauge network, sampled at a high temporal frequency, is required for accurate distributed rainfall-runoff modelling of such small catchments.

Increasing the molecular weight and polarity of the compound headgroup drastically altered the characteristics and performance of the monolayer at the air/water interface. Contrary to the common expectation the monolayer 2 ̆ 7 s lifetime on the water surface decreased with increasing number of ethylene oxy moieties, thus optimal performance for water <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppression</b> was achieved when only one ethylene oxy moiety was used. Replacing the hydroxyl headgroup with a methyl group and with multiple ethylene oxy moieties resulted {{in a loss of}} suppression capability, while an additional hydroxyl group provided a molecule with limited performance against water evaporation.

40|$|The use {{of thermal}} mixing {{by means of}} {{compressed}} air appears to have important potential for <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppression</b> on deep reservoirs. Current methods used to reduce evaporation from open-water impoundments such as floating covers, modular covers, monolayers and shade structures have many disadvantages and negative impacts on the environment. These methods impact the natural/modified aquatic ecosystem established in the dam; alter aesthetic qualities; {{increase the risk of}} dam failure in times of flood; could potentially lead to an oxygen reduction in the water; and may compromise the natural water treatment functions and operations such as the reduction of harmful bacteria, exposure to sunlight (form of disinfection) and natural and mechanical aeration thereby increasing treatment costs. The methodology proposed in this paper to help reduce evaporation losses from open-water impoundments, which indirectly addresses problems of water shortage and the associated economic impacts, involves the destratification of the water body using a bubble plume operated with minimal energy input to reduce surface water temperatures, with, a subsequent reduction in evaporation. The literature, although limited, indicates that this proposed method has merit and requires further research to identify specific reservoirs (size, depth, usage) that could benefit from such a destratification system. <b>Evaporation</b> <b>suppression</b> of as high as 30 % was achieved in some case studies...|$|E

So the closure of a road or reduction in its capacity (e.g. reducing the number of available lanes) will result in the adjustment of traveler behavior to compensate - for example, people might stop making particular trips, condense multiple trips into one, re-time their trips to a less congested time, or switch to public transport, carpooling, walking, bicycling or smaller motor vehicles less affected by road diets, such as motorcycles, depending upon the values of those trips or of the schedule delay they experience.|$|R

The storage contents of reservoirs fluctuate greatly with variations in water use and climatic conditions that range from severe multiple-year droughts to floods. Water surface evaporation typically represents a major component of the reservoir water budget. This thesis investigates the effects of evaporation and potential reductions in this evaporation on the water supply capabilities of reservoirs in Texas. As part of this research, a literature review based assessment of capabilities for reducing reservoir evaporation using monolayer films and other methods was performed. The literature review assessment provides an overview of past <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppression</b> studies performed using monolayer films and other <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppression</b> technologies including water shades and covers. The overview provides a summary on monolayer film application techniques, environmental impacts, operational and material costs, evaluation methods, and achievable evaporation reduction rates.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{utility of}} monomolecular layers ('monolayers') and other surface film {{materials for the}} reduction of open water evaporation has long been argued. However, outside the laboratory, trials to quantify the effectiveness of artificial surface films have produced highly variable results after application to water surfaces, whether natural water bodies or managed farm storages. This paper briefly reviews the physical mechanisms involved in <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppression</b> and the biophysical literature on aquatic surface microlayers. The wide-ranging results from sixteen months of outdoor trough-scale and (simultaneous) replicated bucket-scale evaporation reduction trials are interpreted using biophysical measurements made on microlayer and immediate subsurface water samples taken from the experimental troughs. When the prevailing environmental conditions and other ancillary measurements are taken into account, plausible hypotheses arise to account {{for at least some}} of the observed trial-to-trial differences in evaporation reduction and surface film performance. Results for the commercial monolayer product are inconclusive, as the concentration of the active ingredient in its formulation lacked the uniformity required for the accuracy at which these trials were conducted. Results for the temperature differential between open (unprotected) water and film-covered water, and the influence of windspeed on evaporative loss, indicate that the mechanism of <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppression</b> for mono-molecular (monolayer) organic films differs from that for thicker silicone oil films. These results have implications for both small-scale trialling of evaporation suppressants and the deployment and management of artificial surface film materials on agricultural water storages. In addition, it concluded that despite the attractiveness of simple side-by-side comparisons of performance, meaningful interpretation of results must consider prevailing meteorological conditions, and a timescale of hours rather than days. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{study conducts}} a {{detailed}} analysis of multi-scale periodic features involved in the annual and seasonal precipitation signals at the typical coastal reclamation region in China by selecting the suitable continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and innovatively combining the improved Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT), and further deduces the precipitation trend and its impacts on the future soil hydrological process. The Morlet wavelet transform is proved suitable in revealing the precipitation signals broad-scale periodicities, however, the critical mode mixing problem in CWT causes the poor significance in the fine-scale periodicities, which cannot well match the climate background. By combining the HHT approach, the fine-scale mode mixing drawback in CWT is effectively eliminated, and the the studied precipitation signals multi-scale periodicities are accurately revealed. Consequently, an overall decreasing trend of annual and seasonal precipitation in future years is demonstrated. Furthermore, by novelly using the cross wavelet transform (XWT) and wavelet transform coherence (WTC) approaches, the prominent correlations between the precipitation dynamics and soil and groundwater salinities dynamics, it is demonstrated that the precipitation increase can effectively leach the surface soil salt downwards into the deeper soil layers and groundwater with 5 – 7 -day lag in the new cultivated tidal land. The revealed future decreasing trend of precipitation, especially in spring and summer, may aggravate the soil salinization at the coastal reclamation region, thus some reasonable salt leaching and <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppression</b> measures need to be taken to prevent the possible soil secondary salinization process...|$|E
40|$|Self-assembling {{thin films}} known as monolayers have been {{identified}} as an effective and inexpensive solution to mitigate the evaporative loss of water from dams and reservoirs. A typical monolayer molecule consists of a hydrocarbon chain that is hydrophobic, and a hydrophilic headgroup with a strong affinity to water. When applied to water, these amphiphilic molecules quickly spread across the surface and assemble into a one-molecule thick film that constitutes a physical barrier to evaporation. Previously, field trials of these materials were conducted to assess their efficacy, and while some <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppression</b> was observed, their overall performance was considered poor, especially in the presence of wind. A new generation of monolayer materials have been proposed with the aim of increasing their robustness to the deleterious effects of wind, and to increase their overall evaporation mitigation properties. Computational modelling techniques such as Molecular Dynamics (MD) used in this thesis allow us to observe the interactions occurring at the monolayer/water interface at the atomistic level. We can then relate molecular structural and interaction properties with experimental observables such as evaporation resistance and monolayer stability. Monolayers of octadecanoic acid (C 18 OOH) were previously proposed as an evaporation suppressant, demonstrating strong evaporation resistance under laboratory conditions. However, they were found to be ineffective in the external environment. We undertook MD simulations on this monolayer using the validated OPLS force field to establish its lack of efficacy at the molecular level. We found that although C 18 OOH was able to form close packed monolayers, it was unable to anchor to the water subphase via hydrogen bonding. This was followed by a more comprehensive comparative MD study on several possible evaporation suppressants. We were able to relate atomistic structural and chemical properties with experimental <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppression</b> and wind resistance. Specifically, we found that effective material must be able to form a tightly packed monolayer over a wide range of surface pressures, while maintaining strong anchoring to the water subphase via hydrogen bonding. We found that ethylene glycol-monooctadecyl-ether (C 18 E 1) was the only monolayer molecule to meet this criteria. Multi-component monolayers have demonstrated higher than expected evaporation mitigation performance and we have conducted MD simulations in order to identify the underlying mechanism. C 18 E 1 was blended with octadecanol (C 18 OH) at a range of different ratios, and its evaporation suppressing performance was observed to dramatically increase around ratios of 1 : 1. MD simulations showed that the uneven surface geometry of the mixed monolayer encourages the formation of water-ether oxygen hydrogen bonds, which is not possible in pure octadecanol and negligible in pure C 18 E 1. The additional hydrogen bonding increases anchoring of the monolayer to the water, and explains the improvement in performance of these mixtures. The work performed in this thesis has provided for the first time, a molecular level understanding of the structural and dynamical features of water evaporation suppressing monolayers. Based on this we have also made a significant contribution {{to the development of the}} fundamental requirements for the design of stable and efficient material for water evaporation mitigation...|$|E
30|$|Terrestrial {{evaporation}} and transpiration (evapotranspiration) are {{the components}} of the terrestrial hydrological cycle that are the most difficult to measure given few direct observations (Speranskaya 2011, 2016). Near-surface air temperatures are increasing, and one can expect that the evaporation from wet land surfaces should increase. However, the near-surface wind speeds over the entire territory of Russia have been decreasing in the past several decades (Bulygina et al. 2013 updated to 2016; such studies have not been completed for other parts of Northern Eurasia), and this may reduce the air-surface water vapor exchange. Furthermore, most Northern Eurasian land surfaces are not “wet” so a temperature increase does not automatically induce an increase in evaporation. Opposite processes may prevail due to <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppression</b> by dry upper soil layer (Golubev et al. 2001). Thawing of permafrost and less seasonally frozen ground can significantly change underground hydrological pathways. This will lead to an increase in ground flow, higher runoff during the cold season and, correspondingly, to a decrease in total evapotranspiration. Finally, future ecosystem shifts can dramatically change the vegetation composition (Fig.  4) and the transpiration rate of the new communities can induce further fundamental changes to the regional water cycle. All of the processes above suggest that changes in this component of the hydrological cycle are not trivial and should be assessed within new models that properly account for the interactions among the atmosphere, soil, and biosphere. Large-scale geochemical and geophysical runoff changes (biological and inorganic matter transports) also should be considered.|$|E
40|$|Effective <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppression</b> by a {{monolayer}} film {{is largely}} {{dependent on the}} maintenance of that film over {{as much of the}} water surface as practically possible. Hence, an autonomous system capable of adaptive re-application of monolayer according to the prevailing wind conditions in order to satisfy this requirement is highly desirable. Key to the design and functioning of a system of this nature is a fundamental understanding of the spatial movement/distribution characteristics of the monolayer material. To ‘bridge’ between centimeter-scale, clean room laboratory experimentation (e. g. with a Petri dish) and field conditions (i. e. hectare-scale open water storages), the spreading rate and dispersion behavior of different application quantities of octadecanol monolayer (in water-emulsion) was investigated on 0. 3 m, 2 m and 6 m diameter laboratory water tanks under zero wind stress. A standard formula for spreading is shown to be applicable to ‘bulk’ monolayer from a center point on circular, open water surfaces of scale 0. 3 m, 2 m and 6 m diameter. Under still conditions, monolayer spread (as expected) in a uniform circular pattern outwards, centered on the point of application. ‘Bulk’ application involved the placement of enough material to form layers 1 ×, 3 × or 6 × monomolecular. Hitherto this has not been demonstrated with either these ‘overdosed’ (3 ×, 6 ×) material quantities or at these scales, scales which come closer to those required for monolayer application for the evaporation mitigation of practical open water storages. An empirical relationship for spreading rate has been developed as a function of both time and storage size...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} study exploring {{the limits of}} phase-change heat transfer {{with the aim of}} enhancing critical heat flux (CHF) in pool boiling and enhancing thermal conductance in heat pipes. The state-of-the-art values of the CHF in pool boiling and the thermal conductance in heat pipes are about two orders of magnitudes smaller than the limits predicted by kinetic theory. Consequently, there seems to be plenty of room for improvement. Pool boiling refers to boiling at a surface immersed in an extensive motionless pool of liquid. Its process includes heterogeneous nucleation, growth, mergence and detachment of vapor bubbles on a heating surface. It is generally agreed that the high heat transfer coefficient of boiling could be explained by the concept of single-phase forced convection, i. e., the motion of bubbles agitating surrounding liquid is similar to the process in single-phase forced convection. The occurrence of CHF results from a formation of a vapor film on the heater surface, which reduces the thermal conductance drastically and causes a huge temperature rise on the surface. Over the past few decades, researchers were struggling to identify the exact mechanism causing CHF. General observations are that both surface properties and pool hydrodynamics could affect the values of CHF. Nanowire array-coated surfaces having a large capillary force are employed to enhance the CHF. It has been shown that CHFs on the nanowire array-coated surface could be doubled compared to the values on a plain surface. The obtained CHF of 224 ± 6. 60 W/cm^ 2 on the nanowire-array coated surface is one of the highest values reported in the boiling heat transfer. To further enhance CHF, the mechanisms that govern CHF have been systematically explored. Experimental results show that the CHF on the nanowire array-coated surface are not limited by the capillary force. Instead, the CHF are dependent on the heater size. Corresponding experiments on plain surfaces with various heater sizes also exhibits similar heater-size dependence. The CHFs on nanowire array-coated surfaces and plain surfaces are consistent with the predictions of the hydrodynamic theory while a higher CHF is obtained on the nanowire array-coated surface as compared to the plain Si surface. This suggests that the CHFs are a result of the pool hydrodynamics while surface properties modify the corresponding hydrodynamic limits. A heat pipe is a device that transports thermal energy in a very small temperature difference and thereby producing a very large thermal conductance. It relies on evaporation of liquid at the heated end of the pipe, flow of vapor between the heated and cooled end, condensation at the other end, and capillary-driven liquid flow through a porous wick between the condenser and the evaporation. The large latent heat involved in evaporation and condensation leads to very large heat flows for a small temperature drop along the heat pipe. Despite the large thermal conductance, their operation is limited by such factors as capillary limit, boiling limit, sonic limit and entrainment limit, etc. Among these operational limits, capillary and boiling limits are most frequently encountered. The capillary limit determines the maximum flow rate provided by the capillary force of the wick structure whereas boiling limit is referred to a condition that liquid supply is blocked by vapor bubbles in the wick. Consequently, the wick structure is the key component in a heat pipe, which determines the maximum capillary force and the dominant thermal resistance. In a heat pipe using evaporation as the dominant heat transfer mechanism, a thin liquid film (~ a few microns) extended from the solid structure in the wick causes the dominant thermal resistance. Therefore, if one reduces the pore size of a porous media, the thermal conductance could be enhanced by increasing the surface area of the thin liquid film. On the other hand, the classical thermodynamics depicts that the superheat required for evaporation is inversely proportional to the equilibrium radius of the meniscus. Consequently, enhancing thermal conductance via increasing the thin film area is contradictory to the effect of <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppression</b> for small pores. A hierarchical wick structure with multiple length scales that enhances dry-out heat flux and thermal conductance simultaneously in heat pipes was demonstrated. This hierarchical wick structure is composed of a large microchannel array to reduce flow resistance and small pin-fin arrays to provide a large capillary force. The enhancement of thermal conductance is achieved via a large number of pin-fins for increasing the total thin film area. A thermal conductance defined by the slope of the curve of ~ 16. 28 ± 1. 33 W/cm^ 2 -K and a dry-out heat flux of 228. 85 ± 10. 73 W/cm^ 2 were achieved by this design. Further, vapor transport resistance is minimized within the aligned-multi-scale wick structure. As a result, this wick does not pose a boiling limit. Artificial cavities were created in the wick structure to take the advantage of the high heat transfer coefficient of boiling heat transfer. The wick with artificial cavities successfully triggers boiling at a lower wall temperature resulting in a conductance of 9. 02 ± 0. 04 W/cm^ 2 -K compared to an evaporation mode of 3. 54 ± 0. 01 W/cm^ 2 -K. For a given heat flux, the wick with cavities effectively reduce wall temperature compared to a wick without cavities. Our experimental results display an enhancement of thermal conductance by using boiling heat transfer. This opens up a new direction for further enhancing thermal conductance in heat pipes by circumventing the limit in the evaporative heat transfer regime, in which further increase in surface area will eventually result in <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppression</b> in small pores...|$|E
40|$|From Imperial Dam downstream, in {{addition}} to Mexico, the Colorado River supplies water to Arizona and California for predominantly agricultural use. In Arizona, the Colorado River is {{the major source of}} water supply to the various irrigation districts in the Yuma area. Due to legal constraints, the amount of Colorado River water available to the State of Arizona is limited. On the other hand, it was discovered that the amount of water applied to the soil in irrigation exceeds that amount needed for crop-growing. Two areas where the amount of water considerably exceeds the requirements, the mesa section of the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District and the Yuma Mesa Irrigation and Drainage District, were studied in detail. The excess water applied on the mesa of the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District flows into the Wellton-Mohawk Valley whence it is pumped into a conveyance channel and then discharged into the main channel of the Colorado River. This drain water has a very high salt content and therefore it adversely affects the quality of the river water. Since the drain water is discharged into the Colorado River above the point of diversion to Mexico and it is considered {{to be part of the}} Mexican water allotment, the quality of the Colorado River water has become a source of friction between the United States and the Republic of Mexico. The excess irrigation water from the Yuma Mesa Irrigation and Drainage District flows into the adjacent valleys as well as into uncultivated areas. In the adjacent valleys it is raising the water table and thus causing drainage problems. When it flows underground into the uncultivated lands, in large measure it constitutes a loss of water that otherwise could be put to beneficial use by Arizona. It is known that flood irrigation is not conducive to efficient application of water in the sandy soils that are predominant in these areas, and that the effects of this application of excess water are diverse and far-reaching. The change to sprinkler irrigation would be advantageous in many ways and beneficial to all concerned. The change to sprinkler irrigation on the mesa of the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District would benefit both the farmers and the district financially. At the same time, it would decrease the salinity of the Colorado River water, thereby improving the quality of the water that Mexico receives and, consequently, the relations between the United States and the Republic of Mexico. In the Yuma Mesa Irrigation and Drainage District, the change in the method of irrigation would increase the amount of water available for use by the State of Arizona. Furthermore, it would alleviate the drainage problem of the adjacent valleys and would thereby decrease the amount of drain water flowing back into the channel of the Colorado River. In this district, such a change may entail a small added cost to the farmer. Alternatives for augmenting the flow of the Colorado River, such as importation of water from other basins, desalting sea water, phreatophyte eradication, and <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppression,</b> were found to be economically unfeasible at present or still in the experimental stages...|$|E
40|$|Water {{resource}} planning, development, {{and utilization}} encompass {{the concerns of}} water quantity and water quality. In a given location a sufficient quantity of water is required to sustain community human activities, provide for industrial use, and allow for agricultural needs. The quality of water must generally be safeguarded in order that community health will not be endangered, that the water will be suitable for recreational purposes, that wildlife will be sustained, that the water will not be rendered unfit for agricultural requirements, or {{that it will not}} require extensive treatment for industrial use. Depending on the area of the country, {{one or the other of}} these concerns may be dominant. For example, in the Northeast and upper Midwest, an excess of water has been naturally provided which has allowed the development of large population and industrial centers. But the long term and recently accelerated return of water-borne wastes from these centers to water bodies has caused a critical deterioration of water quality. In the arid Southwestern region of the Uni ted States, the lack of a large natural supply of water and only moderate annual rainfall have retarded the development of the area for both industrial and agricultural purposes. Clearly, the development and maintenance of a sufficient quantity of water has been the dominant concern of this region. The increased emphasis on conservation and optimum utilization of our water resources has generated a multiplicity of research efforts to define and suppress the factors which work toward waste or destruction of these resources. In the arid climate of the Southwest, control of water loss by evaporation from impoundments would constitute a major step in suppressing waste, consequently a considerable research effort has been directed toward the investigation of monolayer films on the surface of small reservoirs in attempts to minimize loss by the evaporation process. On the other hand research efforts designed to prevent the destruction of these resources have been concerned with the effects of foreign chemical components on the ecological regimes within the reservoir system. Such research efforts are not contradictory but should rather be complementary if a total understanding is to be gained of the physical, chemical, and biological implications of alteration of a natural process. When <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppression</b> is achieved by monolayer surface filming, a substance foreign to the water is applied, admittedly in very small quantity relative to the quantity of water in the reservoir. Physical, chemical, or biological forms may then set in to disrupt the film or bring about the disappearance of the added chemical. It is therefore necessary, in order to maintain film integrity, to apply on a continuous or continual basis. Conceivably the eventual application of chemicals might attain a significant level relative to the water, particularly in a small reservoir of low volume to surface area ratio. The chemical added to the water may have several effects with respect to the biological regime in the reservoir, particularly the microorganisms. Obviously, a toxic chemical would be completely unsuitable. Beyond that the chemical may or may not be biodegradable. Nonbiodegradable chemicals, however, are generally considered undesirable as components to be added to a natural environmental system since they would be cumulative with time and might therefore present aesthetic or other unpredictable effects. Biodegradability is desirable, yet it must proceed at a sufficiently slow rate that the effectiveness of the chemical for accomplishing its function is not destroyed. Complete biodegradability implies the complete assimilation and/or respiration of a given chemical by the aquatic microorganisms. Assimilation may be measured by growth in cell numbers or cell mass while respiration may be measured by some technique for measuring the cumulative oxygen uptake. Neither of these techniques is direct and each is subject to some error or misinterpretation. In previous work in this laboratory relative to industrial waste treatment processes, gas chromatographic techniques have been developed and employed for the direct measurement of specific substrate removal in aqueous microbial systems. These techniques have been found to be applicable to the low molecular weight hydrocarbon derivatives in aqueous solution. Quantitative gas chromatography possesses a high degree of sensitivity and provides simultaneous analysis for more than one component. It is thus theoretically possible, under the proper conditions, to detect and measure intermediate metabolites during the course of primary substrate utilization. Therefore, if non-biodegradable metabolites appear in the aqueous phase they may be subject to detection and identification by the same analytical technique used for measurement of substrate disappearance. It was the objective of this project, in relating the monolayer film forming chemicals hexadecanol and octadecanol to water quality factors: 1. To investigate the behavior of hexadecanol and octadecanol in microbial systems using direct and specific analytical capability, with the behavior studies to include detection, identification, and behavior of any intermediate or end product compounds formed as a result of the biological transformation of the hexadecanol or octadecanol. 2. To correlate the behavior of long chain fatty alcohols with studies of lower molecular weight alcohols in which similar analytical procedures are employed...|$|E
