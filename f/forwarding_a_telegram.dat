5000|$|In May 1942, General Pavel Fitin, {{the head}} of KGB foreign {{intelligence}} directorate states in a message to Dimitrov found in the Comintern Archives, [...] "We are <b>forwarding</b> <b>a</b> <b>telegram</b> we received from New York addressed to you from Rudy"; this telegram is signed SON.|$|E
25|$|On 1 October 1950, the {{day that}} UN troops crossed the 38th parallel, the Soviet {{ambassador}} <b>forwarded</b> <b>a</b> <b>telegram</b> from Stalin to Mao and Zhou requesting that China send five to six divisions into Korea, and Kim Il-sung sent frantic appeals to Mao for Chinese military intervention. At the same time, Stalin {{made it clear that}} Soviet forces themselves would not directly intervene.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because, you know, a rule which {{required}} him to forward to the cemetery to-day a dispatch due three years ago, would be as good a rule as one which should require him to <b>forward</b> <b>a</b> <b>telegram</b> to me to-day which he knew had lost all its value {{an hour or two}} before he started it. The construction of such a rule would discredit an idiot; in fact an idiot--I mean a common ordinary Christian idiot, you understand--would be ashamed of it, {{and for the sake of}} his reputation wouldn't make it. What do you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have held}} no {{communication}} with him," [...] said Lady Laura, advancing a step towards him. But Mr. Kennedy simply {{pointed to the}} telegram in her hand, and left the room. Now in respect to this telegram {{there had been an}} unfortunate mistake. I am not prepared to say that there was any reason why Phineas himself should not have sent the news of his success to Lady Laura; but he had not done so. The piece of paper which she still held crushed in her hand was in itself very innocent. [...] "Hurrah for the Loughshanes. Finny has done the trick." [...] Such were the words written on the slip, and they had been sent to Lady Laura by her young cousin, the clerk in the office who acted as private secretary to the Under-Secretary of State. Lady Laura resolved that her husband should never see those innocent but rather undignified words. The occasion had become one of importance, and such words were unworthy of it. Besides, she would not condescend to defend herself by bringing <b>forward</b> <b>a</b> <b>telegram</b> as evidence in her favour. So she burned the morsel of paper.|$|R
5000|$|James Morris, the {{correspondent}} on {{the spot}} of The Times newspaper, heard the news at Base Camp on 30 May and sent a coded message by runner to Namche Bazaar, where a wireless transmitter was used to <b>forward</b> it as <b>a</b> <b>telegram</b> to the British Embassy in Kathmandu. The conquest of Everest was probably the last major news item to be delivered to the world by runner. Morris' encoded message to his paper read: [...] "Snow conditions bad stop advanced base abandoned yesterday stop awaiting improvement". [...] "Snow Conditions Bad" [...] was the agreed code to signify that the summit had been reached, while [...] "Advance Base Abandoned" [...] referred to Hillary (Evans's phrase was [...] "Ridge Camp Untenable" [...] and Westmacott's [...] "Assault Postponed"). This was received and understood in London {{in time for the}} news to be released, by coincidence, on the morning of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation on 2 June.|$|R

5000|$|Rumour has it, {{before the}} finals Benito Mussolini {{was to have}} sent <b>a</b> <b>telegram</b> to the team, saying [...] "Vincere o morire!" [...] (literally {{translated}} as [...] "Win or die!"). This {{should not have been}} meant as a literal threat, but instead just an encouragement to win. However, no record remains of such <b>a</b> <b>telegram,</b> and World Cup player Pietro Rava said, when interviewed, [...] "No, no, no, that's not true. He sent <b>a</b> <b>telegram</b> wishing us well, but no never 'win or die'." ...|$|R
